            Minneapolis has seen tense demonstrations against the Trump administration's deployment of federal agents to the city for an immigration crackdown, raising questions about what these officers can do on the ground and how President Donald Trump can respond.
    


            As protests escalated following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, the Trump administration defended the agent and doubled down on its efforts in the Minneapolis area, sending in more resources.
    


            Trump has also threatened to the extreme step of invoking the Insurrection Act to clamp down on the protests and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has suggested people may be asked to “validate their identity” in some cases.
    


            Here are some of the most common questions, answered.
    


            The law that Trump is threatening to invoke would allow him to deploy active-duty US troops to Minnesota as “necessary to enforce (US) laws or to suppress the rebellion.”
    


            The law says the president can send troops to control situations they consider to be “unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States.”
    


            A state governor or legislature can also request troops — as was the case the last time the law was invoked in 1992 — but Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has openly rebuked the surge of federal activity in Minneapolis.
    


            There is precedent of a president invoking the act without the support of a governor.
    


            Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy both invoked the Insurrection Act against the wishes of governors in order to facilitate school integration after the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling.
    


            On Friday, Trump said there's no reason to use the Insurrection Act “right now,” but that he'd invoke the law if he felt it were necessary.
    


            “I don't think there's any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I'd use it. It's very powerful,” the president told reporters.
    


            Read CNN's Zachary B. Wolf's analysis of the Insurrection Act here.
    


            Immigration agents can use deadly force against someone who poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury, according to a DHS policy. Historically, federal law enforcement agencies have spent weeks or even months conducting exhaustive investigations before deciding whether an agent's use of force was appropriate.
    


            But Trump administration officials have rushed to offer full-throated defenses of immigration agents after high-profile use of force, raising questions about whether mechanisms meant to hold law enforcement accountable for wrongdoing have been abandoned in Trump's second term, writes CNN's Josh Campbell.
    


            The administration has argued agents are immune to prosecution by state or local officials. And any federal prosecutions seem unlikely, Campbell writes, due to Trump's installation of political loyalists atop the Justice Department and FBI.
    


            In August, during the federal takeover of the Washington, DC, police department, Trump effectively gave law enforcement a green light to use force that may far outpace the severity of the circumstances, according to Campbell.
    


            While lamenting images he claimed to have seen showing protesters spitting on officers, Trump said in August, “I said, ‘You tell them, “You spit, and we hit,”' and they can hit real hard,” Trump said. “And they're standing there, and people are spitting in their face, and they're not allowed to do anything.”
    


            “But now,” he added,﻿ “they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want.”
    


            A similar carte blanche signal is being sent to ICE officers and other federal agencies assisting in Trump's immigration crackdown, DOJ insiders have told CNN.
    


            Read more of Campbell's analysis on federal agents' powers here.
    


            Noem said Thursday that federal agents may also ask people around someone they're targeting to “validate their identity.”
    


            “If we are on a target and doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are and why they're there, and having them validate their identity,” Noem said. “That's what we've always done.”
    


            Is this legal? CNN's senior legal analyst Elie Honig said, “It's illegal and it's unconstitutional to require people to show their citizenship papers without some other basis to make a stop.”
    


            “What you cannot do is just go arbitrarily up to people or set up a checkpoint or go door to door and say, ‘Hey, you need to prove to us that you're a US citizen,'” Honig added. “The immigration officer needs to have some reasonable suspicion. You cannot just arbitrarily approach people and make them prove that they are in fact here legally.”
    


            Cori Alonso-Yoder, an associate professor at University of Maryland law school, told CNN federal agents can ask for proof of citizenship, but people can resist showing their documents under the Fifth Amendment.
    


            “ICE certainly can ask and then the question is, then, how does an individual in that circumstance respond,” Yoder, who is also the director of the law school's immigration clinic, said. “Because there are protections under the Fifth Amendment, regardless of immigration status, to not incriminate oneself or to again assert one's right to remain silent when engaging with law enforcement.”
    


            On Monday, Minnesota filed a lawsuit seeking to curb the Trump administration's ongoing immigration crackdown in the state, arguing that it violates the 10th Amendment.
    


            Illinois has also filed a similar lawsuit.
    


            Michele Goodwin, professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University,  told CNN the 10th Amendment established that states retain sovereign power to make local laws and govern within their borders, and the federal government cannot impose its will over a state, unless that authority has been granted by Congress or the Constitution.
    


            In its lawsuit, Minnesota emphasized strains on local police resources, asserting that Minneapolis and Saint Paul have been forced to divert officers from their usual duties to respond to incidents involving federal immigration enforcement, undermining local efforts to protect the community.
    


            Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said earlier this week that the state's lawsuit is aimed squarely at what he described as unlawful federal overreach, not at blocking immigration enforcement itself.
    


            Read why Honig says Minnesota and Illinois' cases “are close to completely meritless” here.

            President Donald Trump said Saturday the United States will impose new tariffs on several European countries unless a deal is reached for the purchase of Greenland, escalating his long-running push for US control of the Arctic territory.
    


            Trump said Saturday he will impose a 10% tariff on “on any and all goods” from Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and other countries starting February 1, increasing to 25% on June 1, until an agreement is reached.
    


            “We have subsidized Denmark, and all of the Countries of the European Union, and others, for many years by not charging them Tariffs, or any other forms of remuneration,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. “Now, after Centuries, it is time for Denmark to give back World Peace is at stake!”
    


            Trump argued that Greenland is central to US and global security and said Denmark's defenses were insufficient, warning that the nations deploying small numbers of military personnel to Greenland amounted to “a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet.”
    


            The president added that the US has sought to acquire Greenland for more than 150 years, and argued that modern weapons systems and missile defense projects, including the “Golden Dome,” make control of the territory especially important.
    


            His repeated statements have strained diplomatic relations between the US and Denmark, which owns the territory but gives the local population the right to self-determination, while also prompting condemnation from NATO's European member states.
    


            Meanwhile Saturday, protesters demonstrated in Greenland and Denmark against Trump's threats to take over the Arctic island, and demanded that its citizens should be allowed to determine its own future.
    


            In Denmark, thousands turned out in the cities of Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg and Odense to stand in solidarity with the Greenlandic population.
    


            A protest kicked off later in Greenland's capital of Nuuk. Just before 2p.m. local time there was an estimated crowd of 5,000 – a large proportion of the island's population of 56,000. People waved banners including “Yankee go home,” and “Greenland is already great.”
    


            In Copenhagen many waved banners with slogans including “Hands off Greenland” alongside the territory's red and white flag, according to Reuters. The protests across Denmark were organized by Greenlandic organizations in cooperation with the NGO ActionAid Denmark. A statement from ActionAid said the unrest was planned to coincide with a visit of US senators to Denmark.
    


            “We are demonstrating against American statements and ambitions to annex Greenland,” Camilla Siezing, Chair of the Joint Association Inuit – one of the Greenlandic organizations involved in planning the protests – said.
    


            “We demand respect for the Danish Realm and for Greenland's right to self-determination. Hopefully, we can show that we are many who support Greenland.”
    


            In Greenland on Saturday, protesters were similarly defiant. Asked what her message to the US president was, one female protester in Nuuk, who didn't give her name, told CNN, “We are not for sale.”
    


            Another protester named Patricia said, “We have seen what he (Trump) does in Venezuela and Iran. He doesn't respect anything, he just takes what he thinks is his… He misuses his power.”
    


            A male protester, who didn't give his name, said, “We do not accept this kind of aggression,” referring to Trump's threats on Greenland.
    


            “My biggest fear is that the US military come here and try to take over our country. But I don't think it will happen.”
    


            Amid the escalating situation, a US delegation of bipartisan lawmakers were sent to Copenhagen to meet with leaders from Denmark and Greenland.
    


            In a press conference on Saturday, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who is leading the delegation, said the Trump administration's “tempo of statements” around Greenland's potential acquisition was not constructive.
    


            Senator Coons also expressed his respect to the indigenous people of Greenland, telling journalists that it was a “remote and difficult place to live, and that the population of Greenland has managed to carve out of an exceptionally difficult environment, a culture and an approach to living that is worthy of deep respect.”
    


            The US lawmaker sought to highlight the partnership between the US and Denmark, including in the military sphere, saying that the delegation would visit a cemetery later Saturday to lay a wreath for Danish soldiers who fell fighting alongside American troops in conflicts such as the war in Afghanistan.
    


            Reporting from Greenland's capital of Nook, CNN's International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson said the visit by the US lawmakers was intended to signal how much Denmark's military partnership with the US is appreciated. “The visit to that cemetery today to lay a wreath, really for them, will sort of encapsulate how much the United States has valued that partnership, valued the lives laid down by Denmark, by Danish troops,” he said.

            Syrian government forces have taken over a number of towns and villages in the Aleppo region after the command of Kurdish-led fighters said it would evacuate the area.
    


            Army units took control of the town of Maskanah on Saturday, according to the military, and were continuing to advance.
    


            There have been several confrontations between the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Syrian military since the Islamist-led government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa came to power just over a year ago.
    


            Sharaa has pledged to unify the country after 14 years of civil war, but the Kurds want guarantees of their autonomy.
    


            The SDF's commander, Mazloum Abdi, pledged on Friday that his troops would begin withdrawing from positions east of Aleppo on Saturday, as part of a broader settlement that was agreed in principle last March.
    


            “Based on calls from friendly countries and mediators, and as a sign of our goodwill to complete the integration process and to adhere to implementing the provisions of the March 10 agreement, we have decided to withdraw our forces … and to redeploy to areas east of the Euphrates,” Abdi said.
    


            Part of the winding river, which flows south from the Turkish border, is now a de facto line between the two sides.
    


            The Kurds' withdrawal followed a visit to the area by a delegation of the US-led international coalition that maintains a presence in northern Syria.
    


            The Syrian military moved into the town of Deir Hafer, some 50 kilometers east of Aleppo, on Saturday, according to geolocated video.
    


            “Thank God it happened with the least amount of losses,” one resident, Hussein al-Khalaf, told Reuters. “There's been enough blood in this country. … We have sacrificed and lost enough. People are tired of it.”
    


            However, fighting continued Saturday in several areas. The SDF said its forces were engaged in intense clashes with government troops in the Thawra oil field area south of Tabqa, “which was outside the scope of the agreement,” it claimed.
    


            The United States urged restraint on the part of Syrian troops.
    


            “We welcome ongoing efforts by all parties in Syria to prevent escalation and pursue Resolution through dialogue,” US Central Command said in a statement Saturday. “We also urge Syrian government forces to cease any offensive actions in areas between Aleppo and al-Tabqa.”
    


            The military has taken control of Thawra and another oil field in the region, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA).
    


            The SDF accused Syrian government forces of entering towns before its fighters had completed their withdrawal, calling it a breach of the agreement. It said some of its fighters were under siege in Deir Hafer “as a result of the Damascus government's treachery.”
    


            In turn, the Syrian military accused Kurdish fighters of firing on a Syrian army patrol near Maskanah, killing two soldiers.
    


            The Syrian military also accused Kurdish units of planting explosives on a bridge on the road east to Raqqa, which remains under Kurdish control.
    


            “Blowing up the bridge would disrupt the agreement, and there would be very severe consequences,” the Syrian army said in a statement Saturday.
    


            The Kurdish-led authority in Raqqa, which is largely populated by Arabs, later declared a curfew in the region.
    


            The violence has raged on despite a decree issued by Sharaa on Friday assuring the legal status and cultural rights of Syrian Kurdish citizens.
    


            The Syrian presidency provided CNN with the text, which promises full citizenship rights for Kurds, thousands of whom — as well as their descendants — have been denied papers for 60 years. The decree also recognizes Kurdish as a “national language” and permits its teaching in public and private schools in areas where Kurds form a notable share of the population.
    


Syrian army launches new strikes in Aleppo as fighting with Kurdish-led SDF intensifies



            Whether the president's decree and the SDF's withdrawal can lead to a broader agreement and end the frequent bouts of clashes remains an open question.
    


            Analysts say the SDF's withdrawal from areas east of Aleppo appears to stem from a desire to avoid what could have become a losing battle. Kurdish units were driven out of several neighborhoods inside Aleppo earlier this month.
    


            Kurdish-led authorities established a semi-autonomous administration in much of Syria's north and east during the civil war and have resisted fully integrating into the Islamist-led government that took power after former President Bashar al-Assad was ousted in late 2024.
    


            Damascus reached a deal with the SDF last year that envisaged full integration of Kurdish fighters in the new Syrian army by the end of 2025, but progress has been limited, with both sides blaming the other.
    


            The US envoy to the region, Tom Barrack, has been involved with efforts to seal a deal between the government and SDF.

BERLIN, January 17. /TASS/. The initiative by Clemence Goethe, Deputy Chairman of the French National Assembly (France's lower house of the parliament), calling for the country to leave NATO could become reality amid disagreements within the alliance, the Berliner Zeitung (BZ) newspaper reported.

""What had long been considered a political pipe dream suddenly became a real possibility: France's withdrawal from NATO <...> the discussion (about Goethe's initiative - TASS) acquired new relevance thanks to the conscious decision of the United States of America to officially return to an overt imperial policy,"" according to the publication.

Maintaining its status as a member of an alliance led by a power that does not recognize international law is undesirable for France, undermines the country's stability, and exposes it to the risk of being drawn into conflicts that run counter to national interests, Goethe said in an interview with BZ.

The country's president Emmanuel Macron also expressed doubts about the direction of NATO's development and deployed French troops in Greenland to counter threats from Washington among other things, the newspaper said.

The France Insubordinate party, of which Goethe is a member, has regularly condemned the actions of the alliance, advocated for its dissolution, and has repeatedly called in recent years for France to withdraw from NATO activities, Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper noted. In addition, in December 2021, Bastien Lachaud, a member of parliament from this party, submitted a resolution to parliament calling on the government to begin the process of withdrawing from NATO's joint command, but it was not approved.

On January 14, Macron warned the US against violating Greenland's sovereignty, which he said would have unprecedented consequences.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Amid escalating ICE raids and attacks on gender-affirming care, organizers ask people to join ‘Free America Walkout'

On 20 January, the anniversary of Donald Trump's inauguration, grassroots organizers are calling on people across the United States to walk out of their offices, schools and businesses to protest the administration and call for “a free America”.

In the wake of escalating ICE raids, attacks on gender-affirming care, cuts to healthcare and the deployment of national guard troops in US cities, the organizers behind the Women's March are asking Americans to participate in the “Free America Walkout”.

As opposed to the large-scale weekend rallies that the Women's March became known for following Trump's first inauguration, organizers have planned a weekday walkout this year. The group says its aim is to show the administration that as it escalates its attacks “on our rights, our bodies, and our livelihoods”, that Americans can escalate in response.

“We really felt like it was important for us to have a mobilization that tested some additional tools in the toolbox,” said Rachel O'Leary Carmona, executive director of the Women's March. “What will it look like if we do an action on a weekday? Where we are withdrawing our labor. Where we're refusing no shopping, no working, no commerce.”

Although the Women's March put out the call-to-action, local groups are organizing “walkout” events across their communities. So far, the group has tallied more than 600 events scheduled across the United States to take place at 2pm local time on 20 January.

“We are seeing people walk out and walk in – and what they're walking into are very different,” said Carmona.

In Houston, she said, people are planning to walk out of school and work, and walk into their elected representatives' offices instead. Other cities are planning mutual aid events, rallies, craft and conversation circles and talks with groups like Leaving Maga. Carmon said it's important that each community assess its own needs.

“The movement can only get so big if organizations are always at the center of it,” she said. “Our goal is always putting the people at the center of it.”

Walkouts have long been a tool of activist movements in the United States, from the civil rights movement to calls to end gun violence. In recent weeks, hundreds of students have staged walkouts in Minneapolis and other school districts in response to ICE raids in their communities.

Like other organizing tools, however, it can take time to see the results.

In March 1968, around 15,000 students walked out of classrooms across East Los Angeles to protest discrimination in the education system against Chicano students. The groups that organized those protests eventually formed the Educational Issues Coordinating Committee, which went on to present a list of students' demands to the Los Angeles board of education.

Although the Board initially rejected those demands, the walkouts created a cultural shift, showing the power of students and their commitment to racial justice in education. Over the ensuing decades, many of the students' demands would be met: schools began integrating Spanish-language instruction and Chicano history into the curriculum, the percentage of Latino teachers increased, and in 1990, William R. Anton became the first Latino superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District.

Organizers with the Women's March are eager to study how effective the Free America Walkout turns out to be, and are partnering with American University sociologist Dana Fisher, who will collect and analyze data on participation.

“This is a stress test,” said Carmona. “We're trying to see what we can do as a movement and what we need to continue to build on so that we can achieve the goals that we want to achieve, which is obviously driving fascism back away from American democracy.”

She doesn't know what the results of Fisher's research will show, but she has a hypothesis. “I go to the gym,” she said. “I know that practice builds muscle.”

Based on the number of events the Women's March has vetted and counted so far, she can say: “This is the most engagement in action we've had in our organization's history.” While many people are fretful about the state of American democracy, she says, that shows organizers that everyday people are “ready to lace up our boots and get out in the street”.

Mark Davis, running in Florida, says he bought domain because Republican party had gone ‘full fascist'

A Florida congressional candidate says he bought the online domain nazis.us and set it up to redirect visitors to the US Department of Homeland Security, under whom federal agents have been carrying out brutal immigration crackdowns at the behest of the Trump administration.

Mark Davis, who is running for Republican Vern Buchanan's US House seat in November's midterms, took responsibility for the ploy in a Friday X post – as polling showed most Americans believe the killing of Minneapolis woman Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent demonstrated problems with the way ICE has been operating.

“I'm a nobody. A dad in [conservative] Florida,” Davis wrote. “And I'm the one who bought nazis.us because [Trump's Republican party] went full fascist and … not a soul in power thought to actually raise hell. So I did.”

Davis, who lists no party affiliation, added that if establishment figures “won't fight Nazis, then a nobody fucking will”.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told TMZ after it first reported on nazis.us that her agency, which houses ICE, had “successfully blocked the redirect” by Thursday morning. However, as of late Saturday, typing nazis.us into a web browser led users to the Homeland Security website at dhs.gov.

Good was killed in one of numerous violent encounters seeing federal officers including ICE agents descend on community members during protests across the US over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

Many who oppose the tactics used by federal agents have likened them to the Gestapo, the secret police of white supremacist Nazi Germany. Notably, after endorsing Trump's victorious run for a second presidency in 2024, podcast host Joe Rogan compared ICE to the Gestapo in the wake of Good's killing.

Trump, for his part, has made it clear that it bothers him when people refer to his administration as Nazis.

“Look, they call me a Nazi all the time – I'm not a Nazi,” Trump said on the CBS News program 60 Minutes in November. “I'm the opposite. I'm somebody that's saving our country, but they call me Nazi.”

Meanwhile, the Intercept news website noted that the DHS's official Instagram account recently published a recruitment post touting “We'll Have Our Home Again”, attaching a song with that title.

The song is popular in neo-Nazi spaces and features lyrics about recapturing “our home” by “blood or sweat,” echoing themes invoked by white supremacists when they call for race wars, according to the Intercept.

Records from GoDaddy'sWHOIS database say nazis.us was registered on 13 January by a user with a Florida mailing address.

Davis received mixed reactions online after claiming responsibility for the nazis.us redirect, with some applauding him as principled and courageous – while others mocked him and promised to help defeat him.

On Friday, he posted a message on the social media platform Threads that he suggested was an answer for numerous media outlets trying to contact him to ask about the redirect.

Supreme leader blames US for death toll and calls Donald Trump a criminal for support of demonstrations

The Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has acknowledged for the first time that thousands of people were killed during the protests that rocked Iran over the last two weeks.

In a speech on Thursday, Khamenei said that thousands of people had been killed, “some in an inhuman, savage manner”, and blamed the US for the death toll. The supreme leader railed against the US president, Donald Trump, whom he called a “criminal” for his support of demonstrations, and called for strict punishment of protesters.

Khamenei said: “By God's grace, the Iranian nation must break the back of the seditionists just as it broke the back of the sedition.”

Iranian authorities also released a compilation of footage on Saturday that purported to show armed individuals carrying guns and knives alongside regular protesters – evidence, they said, of foreign saboteurs.

Another senior Iranian cleric demanded the execution of protesters, demanding that “armed hypocrites should be put to death”. 

He described protesters as “butlers” and “soldiers” of Israel and the US, vowing that neither country should “expect peace”.

Khatami, a member of the Guardian Council and a senior member of the Assembly of Experts, which appoints the supreme leader, is a hardline, influential cleric in Iran.

The speech was in striking contrast to statements from Trump, this week, who appeared to postpone a military strike in Iran, telling reporters that Iranian authorities had agreed to halt the executions of protesters.

On Friday night, Trump thanked Iran for stopping the execution of what he said was 800 protesters, though it was unclear where he was drawing those figures from.

Rights groups have said the repression of protesters is continuing, with more than 3,090 people killed in the unrest and nearly 4,000 more cases still waiting to be reviewed, according to the Human Rights Activists news agency. More than 22,100 people have been arrested in protests, leading to fears of mistreatment of detainees.

The two-and-a-half weeks of protests started on 28 December when traders took to the streets in Tehran in response to a sudden dip in the value of the rial. Protests spread and demands expanded to include calls for an end to the country's government, creating the most serious, and deadliest unrest the country has seen since the 1979 revolution.

The brutal quashing of demonstrations by authorities, which Human Rights Watch said on Friday included the “mass killings of protesters”, has largely driven people off the streets.

With the immediate unrest addressed, authorities were making a public show of punishing those involved in the action, which they had styled as a foreign-backed plot to destabilise the country.

Khatami, in his Friday sermon, claimed 350 mosques, 126 prayer halls and 20 other places of worship had been damaged by protesters. He also said 400 hospitals, 106 ambulances, 71 fire trucks and 50 other emergency vehicles had been damaged.

It was unclear what the fallout of the protest movement will be, or if it will reignite in the coming days. Iran continues to be cut off from the rest of the world, as authorities maintain the more than week-long internet shutdown.

Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late shah of Iran who had become a prominent opposition voice during the protests, continued to call for the overthrow of the government on Friday and urged Trump to intervene.

“I believe the president is a man of his word,” Pahlavi said, adding that “regardless of whether action is taken or not, we as Iranians have no choice to carry on the fight”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The White House on Friday announced some members of a so-called “Board of Peace” that is to supervise the temporary governance of Gaza, which has been under a fragile ceasefire since October last year.

The names include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, former British prime minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Trump is the chair of the board, according to a plan his White House unveiled in October.

Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas signed off on Trump's plan, which says a Palestinian technocratic body would be overseen by the international board, which would supervise Gaza's governance for a transitional period.

Many rights experts and advocates have said that Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory's governance resembled a colonial structure, while Blair's involvement was criticized last year due to his role in the Iraq war and the history of British imperialism in the Middle East.

The White House did not detail the responsibilities of each member of the “founding Executive board.” The names do not include any Palestinians. The White House said more members would be announced over the coming weeks.

The board would also include private equity executive and billionaire Marc Rowan, World Bank president Ajay Banga and Robert Gabriel, a Trump adviser, the White House said, adding that Nickolay Mladenov, a former UN Middle East envoy, would be the high representative for Gaza.

US Army Major General Jasper Jeffers, a US special operations commander, was appointed commander of the International Stabilization Force, the White House said. 

A UN Security Council resolution, adopted in mid-November last year, authorized the board and countries working with it to establish that force in Gaza.

The White House also named an 11-member “Gaza Executive Board” that would include Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Hakan Fidan, the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Sigrid Kaag, United Arab Emirates Minister for International Cooperation Reem al-Hashimy, and Israeli-Cypriot billionaire Yakir Gabay, along with some members of the executive board.

This additional board would support Mladenov's office and the Palestinian technocratic body, whose details were announced this week, the White House said.

Israel and Hamas have accused each other of ceasefire violations in Gaza, where more than 450 Palestinians, including more than 100 children, and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed during the truce.

Israel's assault on Gaza since October 2023 has killed tens of thousands, caused a hunger crisis and internally displaced Gaza's entire population. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say this amounts to genocide. Israel has said it took action in self-defense after Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages in a late 2023 attack.

The moves reflect growing global concern over generative AI tools that can produce realistic images, sound and text, while existing safeguards fail to prevent their abuse. The Grok chatbot, which is accessed through Musk's social media platform X, has been criticized for generating manipulated images, including depictions of women in bikinis or sexually explicit poses, as well as images involving children.

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa issued a decree on Friday declaring Kurdish a “national language,” in an apparent gesture of goodwill toward the minority following clashes in recent days.

The decree is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria's independence in 1946.

It stated Kurds were “an essential and integral part” of Syria, where they have suffered decades of marginalization and oppression under former rulers.

The decree makes Kurdish a “national language” that could be taught in public schools in areas where the minority community is heavily present.

Al-Sharaa also made the Kurdish new year, Nowruz, which falls on March 21, an official holiday and granted nationality to Kurds, as 20 percent of them had been stripped of it under a controversial 1962 census.

In a televised address announcing the decree, al-Sharaa urged Kurds to “actively participate in building this nation,” vowing to “guarantee” their rights.

The announcement came as progress to implement a March deal to integrate the Kurds' de facto autonomous administration in the north into the state has stalled.

Senior Kurdish political figure Salih Muslim told reporters he viewed the decree as “an attempt to evade the rights of the Kurdish people and to divide them.”

The US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) control swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and northeast, much of which it captured during the country's civil war and the fight against the Islamic State group over the past decade.

The country's population of 20 million has around two million Kurds, 1.2 million of them in the northeast, according to Syria expert Fabrice Balanche. 

Syria's Islamist-led government is seeking to extend its authority across the country following the ouster of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad a year ago.

Kurdish forces were driven out of two Aleppo city neighborhoods by the Syrian army last week.

On Friday, Kurdish leader Mazloum Abdi committed to withdrawing “towards redeployment in areas east of the Euphrates,” based on “calls from friendly countries and mediators.”

The Syrian army yesterday said its forces had started entering an area east of Aleppo after Kurdish forces agreed to withdraw from the region.

In a statement carried by state television, the army said its forces “began entering the western Euphrates area, starting with the town of Deir Hafer,” after SDF forces agreed to withdraw yesterday morning.

Work starts around sunrise for the federal officers carrying out the immigration crackdown in and around the Twin Cities, with hundreds of people in tactical gear streaming out of a bland office building near the main airport.

Within minutes, hulking SUVs, pickup trucks and minivans begin leaving, forming the unmarked convoys that have quickly become feared and common sights in the streets of Minnesota's Minneapolis, Saint Paul and their suburbs.

Protesters also arrive early, braving the cold to stand across the street from the fenced-in federal compound, which houses an immigration court and government offices.

“Go home!” they shout as convoys roar past. “ICE [US Immigration and Customs Enforcement] out!”

Things often turn uglier after nightfall, when the convoys return and the protesters sometimes grow angrier, shaking fences and occasionally smacking passing cars. Eventually, the federal officers march toward them, firing tear gas and flash grenades before hauling away at least a few people.

“We're not going anywhere!” a woman shouted on a recent morning. “We're here until you leave.”

This is the daily rhythm of Operation Metro Surge, US President Donald Trump's latest and biggest crackdown yet, with more than 2,000 officers taking part. The surge has pitted city and state officials against the federal government, sparked daily clashes between activists and immigration officers in the deeply liberal cities, and left a mother of three dead.

The crackdown is barely noticeable in some areas, particularly in whiter, wealthier neighborhoods and suburbs, where convoys and tear gas are rare. Even in neighborhoods where masked immigration officers are common, they often move with ghostlike quickness, making arrests and disappearing before protesters can gather in force.

Still, the surge can be felt across broad swaths of the Twin Cities area, which is home to more than 3 million people.

“We don't use the word ‘invasion' lightly,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, told reporters this week, adding that his police force has just 600 officers. “What we are seeing is thousands — plural, thousands — of federal agents coming into our city.”

Those agents have an outsized presence in a small city.

So as worry ripples through the region, children are skipping school or learning remotely, families are avoiding religious services and many businesses, especially in immigrant neighborhoods, have closed temporarily.

Drive down Lake Street, an immigrant hub since the days when newcomers came to Minneapolis from Norway and Sweden, and the sidewalks now seem crowded only with activists standing watch, ready to blow warning whistles at the first sign of a convoy.

At La Michoacana Purepecha, where customers can order ice cream, chocolate-covered bananas and pork rinds, the door is locked and staff let in people one at a time. Nearby, at Taqueria Los Ocampo, a sign in English and Spanish says the restaurant is temporarily closed because of “current conditions.”

A dozen blocks away at the Karmel Mall, where the city's large Somali community goes for everything from food and coffee to tax preparation, signs on the doors warn: “No ICE enter without court order.”

It has been nearly six years since George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer, but the scars from that killing remain raw.

Floyd was killed just blocks from where an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old US citizen, during a Jan. 7 confrontation after she stopped to help neighbors during an enforcement operation. 

Federal officials say the officer fired in self-defense after Good “weaponized” her vehicle. City and state officials dismiss those explanations, and point to multiple bystander videos of the confrontation.

For Twin Cities residents, the crackdown can feel overwhelming.

“Enough is enough,” said Johan Baumeister, who came to the scene of Good's death soon after the shooting to lay flowers.

He said he did not want to see the violent protests that shook Minneapolis after Floyd's death, but this city has a long history of activism and protests, and he had no doubt there would be more.

“I think they'll see Minneapolis show our rage again,” he said.

He was right.

In the days since, there have been repeated confrontations between activists and immigration officers. Most amounted to little more than shouted insults and taunting, with destruction mostly limited to broken windows, graffiti and some badly damaged federal vehicles.

The most serious force comes from immigration officers, who have broken car windows, pepper-sprayed protesters and warned observers not to follow them through the streets. Immigrants and citizens have been yanked from cars and homes and detained, sometimes for days. Most clashes end in tear gas.

Drivers can now stumble across intersections blocked by men in body armor and gas masks, with helicopters clattering overhead and the air filled with the shriek of protesters' whistles.

In a state that prides itself on its decency, there's something particularly Minnesotan about the protests.

Soon after Good was shot, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat and regular Trump target, repeatedly said he was angry but also urged people to find ways to help their communities.

“It might be shoveling your neighbor's walk,” he said. “It might mean being at a food bank. It might be pausing to talk to someone you haven't talked to before.”

He and other leaders have pleaded with protesters to remain peaceful, warning that the White House was looking for a chance to crack down harder.

When protests do become clashes, residents often spill from their homes, handing out bottled water so people can flush tear gas from their eyes.

Residents stand watch at schools to warn immigrant parents if convoys approach while they are picking up their children. They take care packages to people too afraid to go out, and arrange rides for them to work and doctor's visits.

On Thursday, in the basement of a Lutheran church in Saint Paul, the group Open Market MN assembled food packs for more than a hundred families staying home. Colin Anderson, the group's outreach director, said the group has seen a surge in requests.

Sometimes, people do not even understand what has happened to them.

Like Christian Molina from suburban Coon Rapids, who was driving through a Minneapolis neighborhood on a recent day, taking his car to a mechanic, when immigration officers began following him. He wonders if it is because he looks Hispanic.

They turned on their siren, but Molina kept driving, unsure who they were.

Eventually, the officers sped up, hit his rear bumper and both cars stopped. Two emerged and asked Molina for his papers. He refused, saying he would wait for the police. Crowds began to gather and a clash soon broke out, ending with tear gas.

So the officers left.

They left behind an angry, worried man who suddenly owned a sedan with a mangled rear fender.

Long after the officers were gone he had one final question: “Who's going to pay for my car?”

Ukraine needs to ramp up electricity imports as new Russian attacks leaves tens of thousands without power during the country's coldest winter of the full-scale invasion, President Volodymy Zelensky said following an emergency energy meeting on Jan. 17. Russian forces launched overnight attacks on Jan. 16-17 across Ukraine, hitting energy infrastructure, including substations, in Odesa and Kyiv oblasts, triggering emergency power outages, authorities reported.  There are also reports of energy instability in Poltava, Sumy, Chernihiv, and Dnipro oblasts, Zelensky added. ""We need to accelerate as much as possible the increase in electricity imports and the provision of additional equipment from partners. All decisions for this are already in place, and the increase in imports must proceed without delay,"" he wrote. Ukraine can only meet 60% of its energy generation needs, Zelensky previously said on Jan. 16 . The country can only produce 11 gigawatts of electricity but needs 18 gigawatts. Ukraine has ramped up electricity imports, but it is limited by a maximum capability of 2.3 gigawatts. Prices are also sky-high, meaning cash-strapped Ukraine often imports less than that. Rolling blackouts are occurring across the country, even in Western regions, to balance the grid – typically 16 hours without power and eight hours with. Hours after the meeting, a heavy Russian strike seriously damaged critical infrastructure in Kharkiv and injured one person, the city's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, wrote on Telegram. Each attack makes it harder to repair damage and provide heating and power to citizens, he said. ""This is not a case of patch it up a bit and move on,"" he said. ""The energy sector is now in very poor condition — reserves are not unlimited, the load is at its peak, and any new damage immediately 'eats up' the capacity needed for stabilization,"" he added. In Odesa Oblast, around 16,000 consumers were left without power in the morning, Ukrenergo CEO Vitaliy Zaichenko told the Kyiv Independent. In the Bucha region, Kyiv Oblast, where Russia carried out one of the worst massacres during the war, some 56,000 families didn't have power in the morning after overnight attacks, private energy firm DTEK reported on Jan 17. The icy conditions are complicating repair works, the company added. Energy repair workers hope to connect both regions by the evening, Zaichenko said. Russian troops also hit gas infrastructure, damaging equipment used for extraction, Serhii Koretskyi, CEO of Ukraine's state-owned oil and gas giant, Naftogaz, wrote on Facebook. Over the last week alone, Russia struck six different gas facilities, he added. ""Taking advantage of abnormal weather conditions, the enemy intensifies strikes on civilian infrastructure, trying to deprive us of heat, creating unbearable living conditions,"" he wrote. President Volodymyr Zelensky declared a state of emergency in Ukraine's energy sector earlier this week as citizens struggled through bitingly cold conditions without heating and power, with temperatures dropping to -20 Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit) at night. A task force, led by newly appointed Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal, has been set up in Kyiv to manage the crisis.Allies have stepped up support, with Germany sending a 60 million euro ($69.6 million) winter support package. ""This assistance will help keep our people warm and protected by strengthening heating and heat supply systems – with a particular focus on frontline regions,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on social media on Jan. 16. The situation in frontline regions is the most difficult as active hostilities impede repairs, the Energy Ministry said. Russians have been known to hunt energy workers in frontline regions, killing and injuring hundreds during the war. The U.K. also announced £20 million ($26.7 million) in aid to repair and bolster Ukraine's energy security on the first anniversary of the two countries' 100 Year Partnership on Jan. 16.

Germany turned away a Russian-linked oil tanker from entering its territorial waters in the Baltic Sea this week, marking the first known instance of a European country blocking a vessel in Moscow's shadow fleet, Bloomberg reported Jan. 16. 

The Aframax-class tanker, identified by the name Arcusat, abruptly changed course earlier this week as it neared German waters, instead rerouting north toward Russia's Arctic coast, according to Bloomberg and other outlets.The ship was reportedly sailing through the narrow strait between Denmark and Sweden and had signaled a destination in the Gulf of Finland before reversing direction. German media reported that federal police forced the vessel to turn away, citing irregularities in its documentation and identity.

According to open source databases, as well as shipping industry insiders, the Arcusat is listed as having ""never existed."" A ship registry maintained by the International Maritime Organization likewise shows no matching record for the vessel's IMO identification number.

Shipping records indicate the tanker was delivered last year from a Chinese shipyard, though databases disagree on the flag it is sailing under, with some listing Tanzania and others Cameroon. The vessel also reportedly appeared under a provisional name before disappearing from maritime registries.

Germany's decision to turn away the tanker may signal a shift in how European countries address Russia's shadow fleet, a network of aging and opaque vessels used by the Kremlin to circumvent Western sanctions on its oil exports.

In recent months, the United States has seized several tankers linked to Russian and Venezuelan shipments, while European governments have signaled plans to step up enforcement against vessels operating as part of the shadow fleet.

It's hard to imagine Ukraine's political scene without Yulia Tymoshenko.

A veteran politician, Tymoshenko has held a variety of government posts, serving as the country's prime minister twice, being defeated in a presidential runoff back in 2010, and leading the country's opposition at different times. 

On Jan. 14, Tymoshenko was charged with bribery — the third trial of her tumultuous 30-year political career.

Tymoshenko, now the 65-year-old leader of the Batkivshchyna party represented by 25 lawmakers in parliament, has been recorded by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) allegedly offering bribes to members of parliament.

Just like 15 years ago, during her previous trial, Tymoshenko denied the accusations and portrayed the case as political.

For her supporters, now few in numbers, Tymoshenko remains a democratic firebrand and a hero of the pro-Western 2004 Orange Revolution.

Others, however, accuse her of corruption and view her as a relic of the post-Soviet old guard and an irresponsible populist who has shifted her political leanings to stay afloat.

""She's not the kind of figure you can judge in a linear way, or paint entirely in white or black tones,"" political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. ""She is definitely one of the most prominent figures in Ukrainian politics. She is a very striking figure and at the same time a very controversial one.""

Oleksiy Haran, a politics professor at the Kyiv Mohyla Academy, argued that Tymoshenko has a natural ""talent for politics.""

""She truly had a gift — she knew how to maneuver,"" he added. ""She had charisma. But over time, that gradually faded when people saw that she was playing the same games she used to accuse everyone else of playing.""

In the 1990s, Tymoshenko, together with her husband, founded the United Energy Systems of Ukraine, the country's biggest natural gas importer. Success in business propelled her onto the political stage.

Her meteoric rise to fame was driven by Pavlo Lazarenko, the country's prime minister from 1996 to 1997, who saw Tymoshenko as his protege.

Lazarenko fled Ukraine amid a corruption investigation in 1999. In 2004, he was sentenced to nine years in prison on extortion, money laundering, and wire fraud charges in the U.S.

Tymoshenko was elected as a member of parliament in 1996 and co-founded the Batkivshchyna party in 1999 following Lazarenko's escape. The party has been elected to every Ukrainian parliament since 2002.

From 1999 to 2001, she was a deputy of then Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko and spearheaded a reform in the energy sector.

In 2001, Tymoshenko was one of the key opponents of President Leonid Kuchma. She and her husband were arrested on charges of smuggling Russian gas in what was widely seen as a political reprisal by Kuchma.

She spent 42 days in a detention facility, but the case collapsed, and she was released from jail, boosting her popularity.

“If we didn't have Yulia, we would have seen Leonid (Kuchma) morph into (Belarusian dictator Aleksander) Lukashenko a long time ago,” Serhiy Taruta, a businessman, lawmaker from the Batkivshchyna party, and longtime friend of Tymoshenko, told the Kyiv Independent.

Tymoshenko played a pivotal role in the 2004 Orange Revolution, which was sparked by voting fraud in favor of Kuchma-backed candidate Viktor Yanukovych during a presidential election. The results of the election were annulled, and Tymoshenko's ally Yushchenko was elected as president.

""If it hadn't been for her powerful role back then, in 2004, it's still unclear how everything would have ended,"" Fesenko said. ""They could have lost. Tymoshenko (and her protege Oleksandr Turchynov) held (Yushchenko's) election campaign together.”

Following the Orange Revolution, Tymoshenko twice served as prime minister — in 2005 and from 2007 to 2010. During her time in office, she fell out with Yushchenko — a rift that became one of the biggest political stories of the late 2000s.

As prime minister, she pursued a populist policy.

Her government supported increasing social spending, confiscating assets privatized with violations and re-privatizing them, imposing price controls, and intervening in the markets to push prices down.

Since then, Tymoshenko has developed a unique brand of populism targeting mostly the poor and elderly. Retired women have been her core support group ever since.

Tymoshenko has opposed farmland sales and liberalization of utility tariffs. She has also attacked the pro-Western rule of law and free-market reforms, claiming that they restrict Ukraine's sovereignty through the influence of foreign experts on appointments to state jobs.

""She was essentially the founding figure of Ukrainian populism,"" Fesenko said. ""In fact, she was the grandmaster and genius of Ukrainian populism.""

Political analyst Oleksiy Kovzhun told the Kyiv Independent he had stopped working as a consultant for Tymoshenko in 2008 when he ""realized that she was shifting from a progressive politician to a reactionary one"" and bet on ""impoverished older women.""

During her premiership, Tymoshenko met Russian President Vladimir Putin several times and enjoyed an apparently good relationship with the Kremlin, prompting her critics to claim that she was pro-Russian.

Fesenko said, however, that reality is more complicated and that he would not describe Tymoshenko's relationship with Putin as friendly.

""It's a well-known story where both sides try to deceive their opponent, to use them for their own benefit,"" Fesenko said. ""It seems to me that they are both extremely cynical, and that helped them reach agreements.""

In 2010, Tymoshenko was the leading pro-Western candidate. She ran in a presidential election but lost to her political archenemy, the pro-Russian politician Yanukovych, receiving 45.5% in the runoff.

Under Yanukovych, several criminal cases were opened against Tymoshenko in what was widely seen as a political vendetta.

In 2011, a court sentenced her to seven years in jail for allegedly abusing her power while signing the 2009 contract to buy natural gas from Russia.

In 2013, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Tymoshenko's detention was arbitrary and unlawful and likely was politically motivated.

After spending three years in prison, she was released from prison following the 2014 EuroMaidan Revolution, which overthrew Yanukovych.

Her political capital had evaporated by then. 

Kovzhun said that, when she spoke to EuroMaidan protesters in a wheelchair after being released from jail, it was clear she had lost touch with the people.

""These were people who smelled like smoke, who had stood for months on the Maidan under police batons, under bullets — they'd been scorched by fire,"" he said. ""And then a lady shows up saying, 'I'll protect you from injustice.' Their question was 'Who are you?' That's when she lost her connection to the people.""

Fesenko argued that EuroMaidan supporters ""saw Tymoshenko as an outsider.""

""They wanted a different, new kind of politics,"" he added. ""And there were many people there who were disillusioned with what had happened after the Orange Revolution. They no longer believed in Yulia. The Maidan moved forward, but Yulia remained in the past.""

Tymoshenko was the runner-up in the 2014 presidential election with a mere 13% of the vote, while her competitor, Petro Poroshenko, won in a landslide with 55.5%.

""We see that trust in her was declining, and her electoral results were poor,"" Haran said. ""She didn't believe at all that she could lose to Poroshenko. But she did lose. In other words, her star was on the decline.""

In the 2019 presidential election, Tymoshenko came third with 13.6% of the vote, losing to both Poroshenko and Volodymyr Zelensky, who won the election.

“We remember when the 2019 elections were held, and when Zelensky did not launch his campaign, if Zelensky had not run, she would definitely be president,” Taruta said.

Fesenko said that there was a popular desire for new faces, and Tymoshenko was not one of them.

""In 2019, people wanted renewal, because they were disillusioned with Poroshenko and with others — both those who were from the EuroMaidan camp and those who weren't,"" Fesenko said. ""At that point, there was a desire to cast aside everyone who had been part of the old politics.""

Kovzhun argued that Tymoshenko ""was pushed to the political fringe.""

Her current support rate balances between four and six percent, depending on the poll.

Both under Poroshenko and Zelensky, Tymoshenko and her party presented themselves as part of the opposition but often supported the administration's initiatives.

In July 2025, Tymoshenko supported a law, initiated by the Zelensky administration, that eliminated the independence of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO). She virulently attacked the anti-corruption agencies, accusing them of being a tool of foreign governments.

The law was later overturned under public and Western pressure.

But in recent weeks, Tymoshenko apparently decided to move against the incumbent administration.

According to the NABU, she allegedly offered bribes to lawmakers for rejecting the appointment of ministers and sought to ""take down"" Zelensky's majority in parliament.

One possible explanation is that she wanted to provoke the creation of a new Cabinet and get government jobs for her party, according to Fesenko.

Tymoshenko's actions were likely inspired by the weakening of Zelensky's grip on parliament amid a large-scale corruption investigation targeting his inner circle, which led to the resignation of President's Office Head Andriy Yermak in November, he added.

""Since the 2000s, she has essentially always worked using other people's money,"" Fesenko said. ""She knew how to find that money — she's one of the grandmasters of fundraising. The corruption case may damage or even bury (Tymoshenko's political career). Yulia may become toxic for sponsors, and she won't make it without money.""

The warnings come as Trump has suggested possible military strikes against drug cartel targets in Mexico. However, Mexican authorities said the US advisory has no operational implications for Mexico.

The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a series of flight advisories on Friday, warning airlines to exercise caution in the airspace over Mexico, Central America and parts of South America due to potential ""military activities.""

""The FAA issued flight advisory notices to Airmen for specified areas of Mexico, Central America, Panama, Bogota, Guayaquil and Mazatlan Oceanic Flight Regions, and in airspace within the eastern Pacific Ocean,"" an FAA spokesperson said, adding that the advisory is effective for 60 days beginning on Friday.

The warnings cite possible interference with global navigation satellite systems that could cause a ""potentially hazardous situation.""

The development comes amid heightened regional tensions following a US military operation in early January that resulted in the kidnapping of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife on narco-terrorism charges.

Following the Venezuela operation, hundreds of flights by major airlines throughout the Caribbean were canceled after the FAA curbed flights in the region.

US President Donald Trump has also suggested possible military strikes against drug cartel targets in Mexico.

""We are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico,"" Trump told Fox News last week.

Meanwhile, Mexican authorities said the FAA advisory has no operational implications for Mexico and imposes no restrictions on the country's airlines or operators.

Officials added that there is no impact on civil aviation in Mexico and no changes to operating conditions in national airspace.

Donald Trump said he may put a tariff on countries that ""don't go along with Greenland"" as he reiterated his demand for US control of the Danish territory. 

These live updates have been closed. Thank you for reading

Below, you can review headlines, analysis and backgrounders on US threats to take the Danish-ruled island of Greenland from January 16, 2026:

A bipartisan US congressional delegation arrived in Copenhagen on Friday in a bid to reassure the leaders of Denmark and Greenland amid threats from US President Donald Trump to seize the Arctic island. 

The 11-member delegation led by Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons met Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen.

Coons said the delegation was aiming to ""lower the temperature."" 

""There's a lot of rhetoric, but there's not a lot of reality in the current discussion in ⁠Washington,"" Coons told reporters following the meetings. 

Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said the visit showed bipartisan solidarity with the people of this country and with Greenland. They've been our friends and allies for decades.""

""We want them to know we appreciate that very much. And the statements being made by the president do not reflect what the American people feel,"" he added. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found that only 17% of Americans support Trump's designs on Greenland. 

Trump has rattled ties with Denmark, a longstanding US NATO ally, by continuing to insist Greenland come under US control, claiming the move is needed to ensure the strategic island's security.

This week, several European countries deployed troops to Greenland to take part in military exercises to demonstrate a move towards bolstering NATO's Arctic strategy. 

""I don't think troops in Europe impact the president's decision-making process, nor does it impact his goal of the acquisition of Greenland at all,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a briefing Friday.

Speaking during an event on Friday about rural health care in the US, President Donald Trump veered from talking about how he had once threatened European allies with tariffs on pharmaceuticals to doing the same thing to force countries in line with his designs on Greenland. 

""I may do that for Greenland too,"" Trump said as an interjection. ""I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,"" he said.

For months, Trump repeatedly said that the US should control the self-governing island that is part of the kingdom of Denmark.

However, this is the first time he or any of his administration have suggested using tariffs to force the issue.  

Italy has refused to participate in a European reconnaissance mission to Greenland, with Defense Minister Guido Crosetto openly mocking the initiative.

""Greenland. I wonder what for? A trip?...Fifteen Italians, 15 French, 15 Germans — it sounds like the start of a joke,"" Crosetto said of the Danish-led mission.

Following renewed threats by US President Donald Trump to take over Greenland, several European NATO members are sending small military teams to Greenland to examine NATO's ability to defend the Arctic region.

Crosetto also said: ""I am in favor of expanding, not dividing, a world that is already too fragmented."" He added that NATO and the United Nations should remain the primary frameworks for managing international security.

Crosetto belongs to Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing Brothers of Italy party. Meloni is widely seen as having warmer relations with Trump than many other European leaders.

As part of a Danish-led reconnaissance mission, a German reconnaissance unit is landed in Greenland on Friday evening, the German military, the Bundeswehr, told AFP news agency. 

The mission aims to analyze how NATO partners can keep the Arctic safe and assess Germany's potential contribution.

The German Defense Ministry said the 15 troops taking part in the mission include experts in logistics and other areas.

German troops traveled to Denmark on Thursday for initial talks, then continued on to Greenland to participate in the mission with colleagues from Norway, Sweden, Finland, the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands.

Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory that is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, a NATO member.

US President Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for US control over Greenland and insists that only the US can guarantee the territory's security amid ostensible threats from Russia and China.

On Wednesday, the Danish Ministry of Defense announced that Denmark will increase its military presence in Greenland.

Greenland has been back in the spotlight ever since US forces carried out an operation against Venezuela, having captured its leader in the raid.

A group of bipartisan leaders are in Copenhagen to push back against US claims over Greenland.

Plus, troops from several European countries, including Germany and France, continue to arrive in Greenland in a show of support for Denmark. 

Jeff Landry, the US special envoy to Greenland, said he plans to visit the Danish semiautonomous territory in March. He also said he believes a deal can be made.

""I do believe that there's a deal that should and will be made once this plays out,"" Landry told Fox News in an interview on Friday as a bipartisan delegation of US lawmakers was set to meet with leaders of Greenland and Denmark.

""The ‍president is serious. I think he's laid the ​markers down. He's told Denmark what he's looking for, ⁠and ​now it's a matter of having Secretary (of ‌State ‌Marco) Rubio and Vice President JD Vance make a deal,"" he stressed.

Landry was named the US special envoy to Greenland in December, and has publicly supported Trump's push for acquiring the self-governing territory.

Ben Hodges, a retired US general and former commanding general of US Army Europe, now serves as a senior advisor to Human Rights First, a nonpartisan, nonprofit international human rights organization based in New York.

In an interview with DW, he said he didn't believe the US would invade the island that belongs to Denmark.

""I feel pretty confident that there's not going to be an invasion, that they won't use military, because it would be one of the stupidest own goals by America in the last century because of all the damage that that would cause,"" he said.

""However, I take very seriously the president's intention to have Greenland,"" Hodges said.

A German Defense Ministry spokesperson has said the current Denmark-led reconnaissance mission in Greenland is aiming to determine whether Eurofighter jets and frigates could be deployed in the future.

""It is a matter of looking at ‍whether the Arctic is ​secure and ​to what extent we can contribute to this together with our NATO partners,"" the spokesperson said.

""This ‍involves planning exercises, for example, with P-8 Poseidon ​maritime patrol aircraft ... the deployment of frigates or ⁠other ​naval units for maritime surveillance (and) ‌the deployment ‌of Eurofighters is also possible,"" he added.

Donald Trump has renewed global focus on Greenland and the Arctic.

Who controls this polar region, and why are power, security and resources at stake?

Read DW's full report on the changing face of geopolitics in the Arctic.

Jürgen Hardt, a spokesperson on foreign policy from Chancellor Friedrich Merz's center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), has brought up the option of boycotting the 2026 World Cup set to be held in the US, Canada and Mexico.

In comments made to the German newspaper Bild on Friday, Hardt said the boycott would be in response to Trump's threats against Greenland.

""Dropping out of the tournament would, however, only be considered as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue,"" he said, adding that the US president has already made clear ""what a high importance the World Cup has for him.""

Sports Minister Christiane Schenderlein, also from the CDU, did not openly back Hardt's idea, saying that such a decision is up to the German Football Association (DFB) and FIFA.

The World Cup is set to take place between June 11 and July 19, with Germany having already qualified.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that while the situation is tense, he is a little less concerned that the most extreme outcome is what's in store, he told German public TV station ARD on Thursday evening.

""What we're dealing with here is more of a power play,"" Pistorius said, adding that the US Congress would also have a say on the matter of Greenland, not just Trump.

The defense minister went on to say that the US president's main argument is invalidated ""by us saying we can secure the territory, your security concerns, we don't just share them, but we are working to meet them together.""

He also called the deployment of European soldiers to Greenland at this point in time a ""coincidence,"" since the operation had been planned for a while.

Several European countries have dispatched soldiers to Greenland in a show of support for Denmark.

But the US said the move won't change President Trump's intention to acquire the island.

Read DW's full story on the US reaction to European troops being sent to Greenland.

Soldiers from several European nations are being deployed to Greenland in an act of solidarity with Denmark. Germany has also said it is sending members of the Bundeswehr.

While the deployments come amid threats from the US, the justifications given cited threats from Russian and Chinese ships in the Arctic.

""Russia and China are increasingly using the Arctic for military purposes, thereby jeopardizing the freedom of transport, communication and trade,"" Defense Minister Boris Pistorius was quoted as saying.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","'Not just trade': The EU-Mercosur megadeal","https://www.dw.com/en/not-just-trade-the-eu-mercosur-megadeal/a-75507665","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 06:35:02 GMT","

As the EU's share of the global market slips, the Mercosur deal could unlock access to critical raw materials. It's also indicative of a wider EU economic pivot. 

It's a day more than a quarter of a century in the making: On Saturday, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen is jetting off to Paraguay to sign the EU's biggest-ever trade deal with South America's Mercosur bloc.

The EU is styling the megadeal as proof it can forge alliances and chart its own course in an age of disorder. But the pact remains unpopular with climate campaigners, farmers and EU heavyweight France — and could still be derailed when EU parliamentarians have their say in a vote later this year.

The new pact will see the EU's 27 members join forces with Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay to create one of the world's biggest free trade zones.

Negotiations started back in 2000, a heyday for globalization when new partners seemed easier to come by for Europe. But with war in Ukraine raging to the east and US tariffs disrupting trade with the West, foreign policy analyst Andres Malamud says the deal now carries a different political weight.

""Twenty-six years ago, this was an agreement about leadership, about setting rules for trade in the world,""  he told DW. Now, as the EU's share in the global economy has dropped over the years, ""it's about resilience.""

Malamud described the deal as an EU attempt to re-assert rules-based order and norms, ""which are kind of disappearing in the rest of the globe."" In this sense, he added,""this not just about trade, it's about political cooperation and political dialogue.""

Though the deal won't be an economic gamechanger for EU gross domestic product (GDP), it could unlock access to materials seen as crucial for the continent's future.

The EU is eyeing easier access to Brazil's vast mineral reserves as it races to reduce reliance on China for the raw materials used to power green technology and build weapons. Lower tariffs could see Brazilian exporters boost business with Europe.

The country accounts for roughly 10% of global aluminium extraction, 13% for graphite and 16% for tantalum. It also dominates the world market for niobium, a metal used in everything from steel production to the superconducting magnets in the world's largest particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva, Switzerland.

But more incentives for mining are just one of the reasons climate campaigners oppose the deal, which they also warn will drive Amazon deforestation and destroy ecosystems.

Germany's auto industry is seen as the major winner on the European side, as car suppliers search for more customers to cushion the blow of US duties and dampened Chinese demand.

""It's of utmost importance to find new markets,"" Matthias Zink, CEO of German car component manufacturer Schaeffler's powertrain and chassis division told DW last month.

""There will be growth outside the established markets. There will be growth in Brazil, in India, in Southeast Asia,"" he added. 

But one part of this equation cited less frequently by car manufacturers is their scramble to find markets with less regulation to sell more polluting gas and diesel cars in the future. An EU ban on sales of most new gas and diesel vehicles is set to come into effect 2035, although the bloc had already watered down provisions.

The cheer of German carmakers did little to quell anger from Europe's farmers, who claim they're getting a raw deal. ""The EU wants to save German and European industries at farmers' expense,"" one demonstrator, who declined to be named, told DW during a rally in Brussels last month as tractors piled potatoes to block the streets behind him.

In the last year, the EU's executive added new ""safeguard"" measures to limit imports of South American meat and avoid unfair competition, but those failed to convince the bloc's most skeptical member, France.

Poland, Ireland, Austria and Hungary also opposed the pact over agricultural concerns — but were overruled in a vote last week.

Though some big-ticket decisions like sanctions can be vetoed by any EU state, EU trade policies only need backing from a so-called qualified majority of members.

It's rare to see the EU make a major move without France's backing. In Brussels, that's seen both as proof the bloc can act despite divisions — and a sign that more political battles are in store.

Saturday's signature may signal a trade turning point for Europe: Officials are also pushing ahead other agreements once stalled over climate or agricultural standards.

Last year, Brussels inked a decade-old deal with Indonesia — and before the end of the month, von der Leyen is likely to announce another trade pact with India.

Inu Manak, a senior fellow with the US-based Council on Foreign Relations says that's part of a broader trend.

""There has been a notable shift among all US trading partners thinking about where they can diversify their trade links,"" she told DW.

""I don't think that the [US] administration has thought that hard yet about what it means to have more fragmentation in the global economy because of their actions.""

Manak says stiff competition for global influence is shifting the balance of power toward Europe's Asian and South American partners, which were once seen as ""rule-takers.""

""What we're seeing now is that they're saying, 'Well, maybe we don't have to take those rules,'"" she explained.

""Countries say: Why would we do all these things with you when we can get a better deal if we work with China, for example? And they don't have as many conditions.""

At least 32 people died in ICE jails in 2025, and four more have already died in ICE custody this year.

All eyes are on the Trump administration's brutal “immigration enforcement” operation in Minnesota, where roving squads of federal agents in Minneapolis are demanding proof of citizenship from people of color on the street and lashing out  against residents enraged by the deadly shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer last week.

Far less visible is the rapidly expanding, nationwide network of jails and prisons where ICE and Border Patrol lock people up after they are arrested, and that is almost certainly by design. Four people died in federal immigration jails so far in 2026, and at least 32 people died in ICE jails over the course of 2025 as President Donald Trump ramped up his mass deportation campaign. The death count for 2025 constituted the most deaths in ICE jails ever recorded outside the COVID-19 pandemic. 

“If we are seeing that sort of outward extreme violence in broad daylight in the streets of Minneapolis and streets across the country, imagine what people must be facing behind closed doors and behind bars in ICE detention centers,” said Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the Detention Watch Network, in an interview with Truthout.

“If we are seeing that sort of outward extreme violence in broad daylight in the streets of Minneapolis, imagine what people must be facing behind closed doors and behind bars in ICE detention centers.”

The number of people imprisoned by ICE increased by 75 percent to nearly 66,000 in 2025, and despite repeated claims by administration officials about targeting “the worst of the worst,” nearly 74 percent have no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse immigration database. ICE's “roving patrols” and “indiscriminate raids” have contributed to a 2,450 percent increase in the number of people with no criminal record held in ICE detention on any given day, according to the American Immigration Council. 

Ghandehari told Truthout that ICE has long faced allegations of allowing abuse, medical neglect, inhumane conditions, and solitary confinement in its network of jails and prisons, which are used to incarcerate people facing deportation orders. 

ICE's carceral facilities are often run by for-profit prison companies or local sheriffs acting as contractors. While many detainees are held at remote facilities in Louisiana and Texas, far from families and legal support, Ghandehari said ICE is now operating nearly 200 jails nationwide after opening or reopening more than 130 facilities in 2025. 

“What we have seen and are seeing in Minneapolis is enraging; it's unacceptable, it's out of control, but unfortunately it is unsurprising given that ICE is inherently a violent agency, and what we are now seeing in Minneapolis is really the manifestation of years of ICE being allowed to act with impunity,” Ghandehari told Truthout. 

On January 15, the county medical examiner in El Paso, Texas, announced that the death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old man held at a massive immigration detention center at El Paso's Fort Bliss military base, was likely a homicide. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Campos was attempting to kill himself and violently resisted when officers intervened but provided no evidence to back up that claim. 

“What we are now seeing in Minneapolis is really the manifestation of years of ICE being allowed to act with impunity.”

The most recent deaths among those imprisoned by ICE also include 46-year-old Parady La from Cambodia, who was arrested and jailed by ICE on January 6 and died three days later after receiving “treatment for severe drug withdrawal at the Federal Detention Center” in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, according to DHS. La was found unresponsive in his cell the next day and was later pronounced dead of brain and organ failure at a nearby hospital. 

Withdrawal from certain drugs and alcohol can be fatal but is easily treatable with medical supervision and proper medications. In an attempt to revive La, DHS claims federal officers administered CPR and naloxone, a drug used to treat opioid overdoses, not withdrawal symptoms. The Bureau of Prisons maintains a protocol for safely supervising drug withdrawal in federal detention facilities. 

Jonathan Feinberg, an attorney for La's family, said nobody should die in custody from opiate withdrawal.

“We do not at this point know exactly what happened to Parady La, but the circumstances that have been reported are highly suspicious and concerning,” Feinberg wrote in an email to Truthout on Friday. “We intend to conduct a full investigation and pursue every legal remedy available to his family.”

A 2024 report by Physicians for Human Rights examined 52 deaths in ICE custody from 2017 to 2021 and found that 95 percent were preventable or possibly preventable if appropriate medical care had been provided. Civil liberties and international human rights groups have sounded alarm bells about medical neglect and preventable deaths in ICE custody for over a decade.  

ICE did not respond to a request for comment by the time this story was published. However, the official statement on La's death includes a list of mostly minor drug and alcohol violations and accuses the man of being a “career criminal,” reflecting a larger pattern of ICE smearing people who are harmed at the hands of its agents. After Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis while attempting to pull away from the scene in her vehicle on January 7, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem baselessly accused the mother and poet of being a “domestic terrorist.” 

Other recent deaths in ICE custody include Luis Beltran Yanez-Cruz, 68, who was detained at the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in California and died on January 6, and Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, 42, who was detained at the Joe Corley Processing Center in Texas and died on January 5, according to Detention Watch Network. 

“You can imagine how bad the conditions have been getting,” Ghandehari said. “It's not even a full two weeks into this new year, and we already have four deaths in ICE custody.” 

ICE cannot place U.S. citizens in detention for extended periods of time, but multiple citizens have reportedly been arrested by ICE under Trump's crackdown, including George Retes, a U.S. veteran who was wrongly detained by ICE in California for three days after a chaotic raid on a cannabis farm in August.

ICE cannot place U.S. citizens in detention for extended periods of time, but multiple citizens have reportedly been arrested by ICE under Trump's crackdown.

The Oglala Sioux Tribe, one of the largest tribal nations in the U.S., has accused ICE of illegally holding four members arrested during raids in Minneapolis, according to Axios. 

From New Jersey to California to Minnesota, immigration officials have barred Democratic lawmakers from entering ICE jails to conduct unannounced inspections and check on incarcerated constituents. A federal judge recently struck down a policy requiring advance notice from lawmakers, but Noem instituted a new policy that blocked Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and other Democrats from visiting the central ICE holding facility in the Twin Cities shortly after Good was killed. 

“When we appropriate funds as members of Congress, we are expected by the public to do oversight because the public requires their money be used with transparency and accountability,” Omar told reporters on January 10. “And what happened today is ICE agents decided that we were no longer allowed to fulfill our constitutional duties.” 

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California) says he may be the only member of Congress to conduct an oversight visit to an ICE jail under the Trump administration. Khanna and a staff member visited ICE California City Detention Center on January 6, the largest ICE prison in California. Khanna made the visit after one of his constituents “was beaten, unlawfully detained, and held at this very facility before being deported,” according to a social media post. 

Khanna said he was “deeply disturbed” by his visit to the ICE prison, which currently holds nearly 1,500 people. When he spoke to families in the parking lot, they described their loved ones being subjected to “inadequate food, visible mold, and water that tastes like metal.” A lack of medical care was the most alarming failure, Khanna said, with one detainee telling the congressman that he was urinating blood but still had not received medical care. 

“For illnesses like the flu, medicine is rarely provided; at best, [an] ibuprofen is given, but more often detainees are told to buy basic medicine from the commissary at exaggerated, unaffordable prices,” Khanna said. “With reportedly only one doctor for hundreds of people, the neglect is structural.”

Congress faces a self-imposed January 30 deadline to pass legislation funding the government, which gives lawmakers a chance to rein in ICE by defunding the infrastructure that makes Trump's brutal “immigration” crackdown possible, including the expanding network of ICE jails and prisons, according to Ghandehari. ICE's budget is set to balloon by $170 billion under the megabill championed by Trump and passed by Republicans in July 2025, but some progressive Democrats are now pushing to defund the agency. 

“They can't do what they are doing without infrastructure that has been built up over decades,” Ghandehari told Truthout, explaining that the only way to stop the Trump administration's violence is by starting to dismantle ICE's infrastructure. ”That's why it's so important that Congress do the right things this week and start the process of cutting ICE off.”

            The smell of wet grass from the recent atmospheric river rains, mud and gasoline wafts through the warm Southern California air as Alec Derpetrossian works the chainsaw with a foreman, Randy Magaña, who helps him guide where to put the blade. Derpetrossian is still learning how to adequately use the large tool.
    


            Magaña shows him how to maneuver the blade around a thick trunk, as the foreman kicks it loose.
    


            It takes several times to cut down a branch and even longer to conquer a three-pronged tree trunk, as the men struggle to cut the thick tree down.
    


            “Timber!” yells Derpetrossian as a tree comes down.
    


            Derpetrossian and Magaña are working in the Sepulveda Basin, near the Los Angeles River, under shaded trees that they are working to take down. The area is prone to brush fires, thanks to thick vegetation and the presence of homeless encampments.
    


            The men are part of Crew 4, the Los Angeles Fire Department's first full-time paid wildland hand crew aiming to protect the City of Angels from another Palisades Fire, the historic firestorm disaster that decimated the Pacific Palisades area in January 2025.
    


            The blaze was part of 12 fires that broke out in the Los Angeles area, killing 31 people in the Altadena and Pacific Palisades communities and destroying thousands of homes and structures. The Eaton and Palisades fires have left permanent marks in history by joining the top 10 deadliest wildfires in California.
    


            The crew's purpose is to beef up the city's emergency response as well as vegetation management throughout Los Angeles to prevent brush fires from spreading out of control, the team's superintendent Capt. Travis Humpherys said. A large portion of the city lies in a what is known as a “very high fire hazard zone.”
    


            During active fires, the crew digs lines and removes brush out ahead of the fire or along the fire's edge to help extinguish the blaze.
    


            But before a fire even starts, their goal is to remove invasive trees and brush, so when a blaze ignites and the infamous Santa Ana winds are blowing, embers don't fly into tree canopies or dry vegetation and spread the fire more rapidly.
    


            While Derpetrossian and Magaña are conquering the tough tree, it takes several crew members to cut, pull, drag and carry heavy branches to a woodchipper, which shreds branches and trunks and spits out chips in a matter of seconds.
    


            When Derpetrossian finally sees sunlight through the trees' canopy, he thinks “I just did that, I didn't know I could do that,” he says, his face covered in woodchips and dripping with sweat.
    


            The addition of Crew 4 to the LAFD's firefighting toolbox comes as wildfire disasters in California are becoming significantly larger, more destructive and deadlier.
    


            The area burned by wildfires and the number of large wildfires in California have increased over the past decades, largely influenced by “changes in land use, fire management practices, and the impact of climate change,” according to the state's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.
    


            Additionally, the annual average area burned in the state between 2020 and 2024 was about three times higher compared to the 2010s, the agency reported.
    


            The crew is preparing for fire season, which in Southern California typically runs from late spring to October, except fires can now happen any time in the region thanks to changes in climate conditions, dry vegetation and gusty winds.
    


            “We can always have those high winds. We have the little fuel moisture and the very dry vegetation,” LAFD Chief Adam VanGerpen said. “There's no such thing as fire season, because it's year-round …The fires are going to come, unfortunately, but we're here and ready to protect the citizens of LA.”
    


            As an example, the Palisades Fire, which killed 12 people and became the third-most destructive wildfire in California history after destroying thousands of structures and burning more than 23,000 acres, began January 7, 2025, outside the typical window for wildfires.
    


            Crew 4 members graduated in June 2025, after five weeks of rigorous training. They continue to train daily and build a lasting comradery, members told CNN.
    


            The team trains by going on runs or hikes in difficult terrains throughout Los Angeles County and by doing brush clearance several times a week.
    


            They work out of Fire Station 88 in the San Fernando Valley which doubles as a training facility. The team is becoming a main trainer for the LAFD for all wildland fire training, Humpherys said.
    


            Crew 4 is made of more than 20 wildland fire technicians, who are civilians, three foremen, who are sworn LAFD members, and the superintendent.
    


            A volunteer program started in 2006, and officials pushed for a paid crew ever since then, firefighter foreman Paul Wingate said.
    


            The paid hand crew is a “huge benefit” to the LAFD, according to Wingate.
    


            “We only had that one volunteer crew, which (was) only staffed maybe twice a week. Now, we have a full-time paid crew to staff four times a week, and that's going to add to the resources to help out on these fires, and they're not going to stop,” Wingate said. “The more resources and boots on the ground we have, it's going to help when we do have that next event like the Palisades Fire.”
    


            VanGerpen, Wingate and others are confident that the team is ready for the next fire disaster.
    


            “This crew is 100% ready to respond to and assist on a fire,” Humpherys said.
    


            “They've gone through a rigorous training academy, and we've trained nonstop from when we first started back in late May, early June. So, if the response comes out, we're ready to go, and we're prepared to attack the fire in any way we can.”
    


            The safety of residents remains the top priority for the LAFD, Chief Jamie Moore said in a statement on the anniversary of the Palisades Fire.
    


            “The lessons from the Palisades Fire are shaping how we train, prepare, deploy resources, and how we work alongside the communities we serve. These changes are driven by a shared goal: protecting lives, homes, and the sense of security every family deserves,” Moore said.
    


            Crew 4's mission is crucial in keeping residents safe, Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement to CNN.
    


            “Keeping Angelenos safe means investing in prevention, not just response,” Bass said. “LAFD's Crew 4 plays a critical role in brush clearance and vegetation management, while also responding to fires and all-hazard incidents. I'm grateful for this team's dedication and the work they continue to do to protect our communities.”
    


            Derpetrossian was working with a hot shot crew with the Angeles National Forest when he got called down to help fight fires that were popping up around Los Angeles while the Palisades Fire wreaked havoc on the city's Westside.
    


            Other members worked with the volunteer crew before joining Crew 4. Some were influenced to work in public safety from a young age, while others are the first in their family to join the fire service.
    


            They come from all walks of life and with different levels of experience, Magaña said.
    


            “The beauty of it is (our) diversity and trying to build the best team,” he said.
    


            Jesus Vivas got an up-close view of what Los Angeles paramedics do from a young age. His childhood friend was shot when he was young, then years later his father suffered cardiac arrest. Both times, paramedics were there to assist.
    


            Vivas knew he wanted to be a role model for his family and community someday, like those paramedics.
    


            “It's that long thread that has continued this ambition of trying to become a city of Los Angeles firefighter,” Vivas said.
    


            A few years ago, he heard about the volunteer program, and he signed up to join. After his success with that team, he was able to join Crew 4.
    


            He has wildfire experience, as he responded to multiple blazes that ignited last January throughout the city he still calls home.
    


            His training kicked in, which he says, prepares him for the unknown.
    


            “I didn't get nervous, I just relied on my training, relied on my hand crew, on my members, on my foreman, and we were able to do the job fully, completely,” Vivas said. “We know our city, and we understand its topography … We're learning every day. This is our city, and we're here to protect it.”
    


            Similarly, Pedro Rodriguez got a text saying the volunteer crew he was a part of was getting activated to help combat the fires. He immediately went to work.
    


            “Just seeing houses and the city burning, it just inspired me to be a part of this paid crew,” Rodriguez said. “Mother Nature, it's going to do its thing when it wants to. All we could do is prepare for what it's going to do and try to combat it the best way we can.”
    


            Rodriguez said another benefit of the LAFD having its own hand crew is that it doesn't have to borrow resources from neighboring departments to fight their own fires.
    


            “Now, when a call goes out, our crew is ready … The firefighters know that we're coming and we're going to help them out with whatever they need. We're there to help and support on that fire,” Rodriguez said.
    


            Justin Treiber had just graduated from an academy at a community college when the Palisades Fire started.
    


            He was anxious to be part of a team battling the catastrophic blaze. On day 4 of the fire fight, he had his first interview to be part of Crew 4, and he let his interviewer know he was able and ready.
    


            Treiber didn't have any experience in wildland firefighting but he wanted to be a role model for his younger siblings.
    


            “I've been dedicated to this crew ever since, and I absolutely love it every single day here,” he said.
    


            He said a hand crew is essential in battling wildfires in an urban landscape, and Crew 4 has an advantage because they are familiar with the terrain of the city.
    


            “We already know the environment, because we've either been training in it, we've been working through it … and so we know the fire has done this in this area last time,” Treiber said. “We already kind of have an idea of how this fire might go or how it responds, and it gives us an upper hand on fighting these fires, so they don't get out of control.”

NUUK, Greenland (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that he would charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European nations because of their opposition to American control of Greenland.

Trump said in a social media post that Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland would face the tariff and that it would climb to 25% on June 1 if a deal is not in place for “the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland” by the United States.

The threat of tariffs was a drastic and potentially dangerous escalation of a showdown between Trump and NATO allies, further straining an alliance that dates to 1949 and provides a collective degree of security to Europe and North America. The Republican president has repeatedly tried to use trade penalties to bend allies and rivals alike to his will, generating investment commitments from some nations and pushback from others such as China, Brazil and India.

It was unclear how Trump could impose the tariffs under U.S. law, though he could cite economic emergency powers that are currently subject to a U.S. Supreme Court challenge.

Trump said in his Truth Social post that his tariffs were retaliation for recent trips to Greenland by representatives from Britain, the Netherlands and Finland and for general opposition to his efforts to purchase the semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. He has Greenland is essential for the “Golden Dome” missile defense system for the U.S., and has argued that Russia and China might try to take over the island.




Resistance has steadily built in Europe to Trump's ambitions, even as several countries on the continent agreed to his 15% tariffs last year in order to preserve an economic and security relationship with Washington.

Earlier Saturday, hundreds of people in Greenland's capital braved near-freezing temperatures, rain and icy streets to march in a rally in support of their own self-governance.

The Greenlanders waved their red-and-white national flags and listened to traditional songs as they walked through Nuuk's small downtown. Some carried signs with messages like “We shape our future,” “Greenland is not for sale” and “Greenland is already GREAT.” They were joined by thousands of others in rallies across the Danish kingdom.

The rallies occurred hours after a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation in Copenhagen sought to reassure Denmark and Greenland of their support.

U.S. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said the current rhetoric around Greenland was causing concern across the Danish kingdom and that he wanted to de-escalate the situation.

“I hope that the people of the Kingdom of Denmark do not abandon their faith in the American people,” he said in Copenhagen, adding that the U.S. has respect for Denmark and NATO “for all we've done together.”

Danish Maj. Gen. Søren Andersen, leader of the Joint Arctic Command, told The Associated Press that Denmark doesn't expect the U.S. military to attack Greenland, or any other NATO ally, and that European troops were recently deployed to Nuuk for Arctic defense training.

He said that the goal isn't to send a message to the Trump administration, even through the White House hasn't ruled out taking the territory by force.

“I will not go into the political part, but I will say that I would never expect a NATO country to attack another NATO country,” he told the AP on Saturday aboard a Danish military vessel docked in Nuuk. “For us, for me, it's not about signaling. It is actually about training military units, working together with allies.”

The Danish military organized a planning meeting Friday in Greenland with NATO allies, including the U.S., to discuss Arctic security on the alliance's northern flank in the face of a potential Russian threat. The Americans were also invited to participate in Operation Arctic Endurance in Greenland in the coming days, Andersen said.

In his 2½ years as a commander in Greenland, Andersen said that he hasn't seen any Chinese or Russian combat vessels or warships, despite Trump saying that they were off the island's coast.

But in the unlikely event of American troops using force on Danish soil, Andersen confirmed a Cold War-era law governing Danish rules of engagement.

“But you are right that it is Danish law that a Danish soldier, if attacked, has the obligation to fight back,” he said.

Thousands of people marched through Copenhagen, many of them carrying Greenland's flag. Others held signs with slogans like “Make America Smart Again” and “Hands Off.” 

“This is important for the whole world,” Danish protester Elise Riechie told the AP as she held Danish and Greenlandic flags. “There are many small countries. None of them are for sale.”

Trump has sought to justify his calls for a U.S. takeover by repeatedly saying that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland, which holds vast untapped reserves of critical minerals.

“There are no current security threats to Greenland,” Coons said.

Trump has insisted for months that the U.S. should control Greenland, and said earlier this week that anything less than the Arctic island being in U.S. hands would be “unacceptable.” 

During an unrelated event at the White House about rural health care, he recounted Friday how he had threatened European allies with tariffs on pharmaceuticals.

“I may do that for Greenland, too,” Trump said.

He had not previously mentioned using tariffs to try to force the issue.

Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met in Washington with Trump's vice president, JD Vance, and secretary of state, Marco Rubio. 

That encounter didn't resolve the deep differences, but did produce an agreement to set up a working group — on whose purpose Denmark and the White House then offered sharply diverging public views. 

European leaders have said that it's only for Denmark and Greenland to decide on matters concerning the territory, and Denmark said this week that it was increasing its military presence in Greenland in cooperation with allies.

“There is almost no better ally to the United States than Denmark,” Coons said. “If we do things that cause Danes to question whether we can be counted on as a NATO ally, why would any other country seek to be our ally or believe in our representations?”

Excessive speeding was so common on parallel one-way streets passing a massive electronics plant that Indianapolis residents used to refer to the pair as a “racetrack” akin to the city's famous Motor Speedway a few miles west.

Originally two-way thoroughfares, Michigan and New York streets switched to opposite one-way routes in the 1970s to help thousands of RCA workers swiftly travel to and from their shifts building televisions or pressing vinyl records. But after the RCA plant closed in 1995, the suddenly barren roads grew even more enticing for lead-footed drivers — until last year, when city officials finally converted them back to two-way streets.

“The opening and conversion of those streets has just been transformative for how people think about that corridor,” said James Taylor, who runs a nearby community center.

Embracing the oft-repeated slogan that “paint is cheap,” transportation planners across the U.S. — particularly in midsize cities — have been turning their unidirectional streets back to multidirectional ones. They view the step as one of the easiest ways to improve safety and make downtowns more alluring to shoppers, restaurant patrons and would-be residents.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Dave Amos, an assistant professor of city and regional planning at California Polytechnic State University, said almost no major streets in the U.S. originated as one-way routes. Two-way streets were the standard, before mass migration to the suburbs prioritized faster commutes over downtown walkability.

“One-way streets are designed for moving cars quickly and efficiently,” Amos said. “So when you have that as your goal, pedestrians and cyclists almost by design are secondary, which makes them more vulnerable.”

But the propensity to speed isn't the only reason one-way streets are viewed as less safe.




Wade Walker, an engineer with Kittelson & Associates who has worked on street conversion projects in Lakeland, Florida; Lynchburg, Virginia; and Chattanooga, Tennessee, said there is a misperception that one-way streets are safer because people on foot only have to look one direction to see the incoming traffic. The confusion arises when one-way streets combine with two-way streets to form a city grid, he said.

Pedestrians crossing a signalized intersection of two-way streets can expect to encounter vehicles in a certain sequence: those turning left on green, traveling straight, and turning right on red. But when one-way streets are included, there are 16 potential sequences depending on the type and direction of the roads that intersect, Walker said.

“It's not the number of conflicts, it's the way those conflicts occur,” he said.

Louisville, Kentucky, about two hours south of Indianapolis, has been restoring one-way streets to their original two-way footprints. The state is leading an ongoing project to reconvert a stretch along Main Street that passes such landmarks as the Louisville Slugger Museum, the KFC Yum! Center arena, and a minor-league baseball stadium.

One of the city's biggest redesigns is happening this year in the predominantly Black western part of the city, where many roads changed to one-way routes in the 1970s to feed a new interstate bridge over the Ohio River. However, it decimated neighborhoods and cut off the once-thriving community from downtown.

“All those mom-and-pop shops and local businesses over time kind of faded because that connectivity got taken away,” said Michael King, the city's assistant director of transportation planning. “It just feels more like, ‘This is a road to get me through here pretty quickly.'”

Within three years after some of Chattanooga's two-way streets were transformed into unidirectional ones, business vacancies skyrocketed and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga became “landlocked” to prevent students from having to cross a dangerous road, Walker said.

In 2022, almost two decades after the road was redesigned, he returned to find the college campus had expanded across it and business construction had surged.

When Lynchburg, Virginia launched a long-discussed plan to change its downtown Main Street back to two ways, Rodney Taylor voiced concerns that it would doom his restaurant by blocking delivery vehicles. After the city completed the section in 2021, he acknowledged the fears were unfounded.

“An important thing to do is to admit when you're wrong,” he said. “And I was just flat-out wrong.”

Many residents also changed their tune in Austin, Texas, when the city began reconverting some of the one-way streets in its urban core, said Adam Greenfield, executive director with Safe Streets Austin.

“It just worked,” said Greenfield, who is now lobbying the city to do away with all its one-way streets. “That's what you'll find with these conversions — they'll be done and then instantly people will be like, ‘Why didn't we do this 20 years ago?'”

After Chicago went the opposite direction last year and suddenly changed some of its two-way streets to one-way in the busy West Loop restaurant district, a politician representing an adjacent area got numerous calls from confused constituents.

“Even if this was the right move to make these streets one-way, it certainly doesn't make sense to not ask the opinion of the neighbors,” Alderman Bill Conway said.

Now that Indianapolis has finished the redesigns for Michigan and New York streets, there are 10 other conversions on tap next, said Mark St. John, chief engineer for the city's Department of Public Works. The total cost for those projects is estimated at $60 million, with around $25 million of that from a 2023 federal grant.

James Taylor, who runs the community center near the old RCA plant, said it is too early to know the full impact. Some business owners, however, have signaled construction plans along the redesigned streets, which Taylor says still feel a little strange.

“I've been driving around that neighborhood for 30 years,” he said. “It's all kind of familiar, but you're coming at it from a whole different perspective.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A Cuban immigrant died in a Texas immigration detention facility earlier this month during an altercation with guards, and the local medical examiner has indicated that his death will likely be classified as a homicide.

The federal government has provided a differing account surrounding the Jan. 3 death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, saying the detainee was attempting suicide and staff tried to save him.

A witness told The Associated Press that Lunas Campos died after he was handcuffed, tackled by guards and placed in a chokehold until he lost consciousness. The immigrant's family was told by the El Paso County Medical Examiner's Office on Wednesday that a preliminary autopsy report said the death was a homicide resulting from asphyxia from chest and neck compression, according to a recording of the call reviewed by the AP.

The death and conflicting accounts have intensified scrutiny into the conditions of immigration jails at a time when the government has been rounding up immigrants in large numbers around the country and detaining them at facilities like the one in El Paso where Lunas Campos died.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is legally required to issue public notification of detainee deaths. Last week, it said Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old father of four and registered sex offender, had died at Camp East Montana, but made no mention of him being involved in an altercation with staff immediately before his death.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




In response to questions from the AP, the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, on Thursday amended its account of Lunas Campos' death, saying he tried to kill himself.




“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”

In an interview before DHS updated its account, detainee Santos Jesús Flores, 47, from El Salvador, said he witnessed the incident through the window of his cell in the special housing unit, where detainees are held in isolation for disciplinary infractions. 

“He didn't want to enter the cell where they were going to put him,” Flores told the AP on Thursday, speaking in Spanish from a phone in the facility. “The last thing he said was that he couldn't breathe.”

Camp Montana East is a sprawling tent facility hastily constructed in the desert on the grounds of Fort Bliss, an Army base. The AP reported in August that the $1.2 billion facility, expected to become the largest detention facility in the United States, was being built and operated by a private contractor headquartered in a single-family home in Richmond, Virginia. The company, Acquisition Logistics LLC, had no prior experience running a corrections facility.

It was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of the private contractor. Emails seeking comment on Thursday from Acquisition Logistics executives received no response.

Lunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, New York, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.

ICE said he was picked up in July as part of a planned immigration enforcement operation due to criminal convictions that made him eligible for removal.

New York court records show Lunas Campos was convicted in 2003 of sexual contact with an individual under 11, a felony for which he was sentenced to one year in jail and placed on the state's sex offender registry.

Lunas Campos was also sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervision in 2009 after being convicted of attempting to sell a controlled substance, according to the New York corrections records. He completed the sentence in January 2017.

Lunas Campos' adult daughter said the child sexual abuse accusation was false, made as part of a contentious custody battle.

“My father was not a child molester,” said Kary Lunas, 25. “He was a good dad. He was a human being.”

On the day he died, according to ICE, Lunas Campos became disruptive while in line for medication and refused to return to his assigned dorm. He was then taken to the segregation block.

“While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance,” the agency said in its Jan. 9 release. “Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services.”

Lunas Campos was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.

Flores said that account omitted key details — Lunas Campos was already handcuffed when at least five guards pinned him to the floor, and at least one squeezed his arm around the detainee's neck.

Within about five minutes, Flores said, Lunas Campos was no longer moving.

“After he stopped breathing, they removed the handcuffs,” Flores said.

Flores is not represented by a lawyer and said he has already consented to deportation to his home country. Though he acknowledged he was taking a risk by speaking to the AP, Flores said he wanted to highlight that “in this place, guards abuse people a lot.”

He said multiple detainees in the unit witnessed the altercation, and security cameras there should have captured the events. Flores also said investigators had not interviewed him. 

DHS did not respond to questions about whether Lunas Campos was handcuffed when they say he attempted suicide, or exactly how he had tried to kill himself.

“ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody,” McLaughlin said. “This is still an active investigation, and more details are forthcoming.”

DHS wouldn't say whether other agencies were investigating. The El Paso medical examiner's office confirmed Thursday that it conducted an autopsy, but declined further comment.

A final determination of homicide by the medical examiner would typically be critical in determining whether any guards are held criminally or civilly liable. When such deaths are ruled accidental or something other than homicide, they are less likely to trigger criminal investigations, while civil wrongful death lawsuits become harder to prove.

The fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could also limit state and local officials' legal jurisdiction to investigate. An El Paso County District Attorney's Office spokesperson declined to comment Thursday on whether it was involved in an investigation.

The deaths of inmates and other detainees after officers hold them face down and put pressure on their backs and necks to restrain them have been a problem in law enforcement for decades. A 2024 AP investigation documented hundreds of deaths during police encounters in which people were restrained in a prone position. Many uttered “I can't breathe” before suffocating, according to scores of body camera and bystander videos. Authorities often attempt to shift the blame for such deaths to preexisting medical conditions or drug use.

Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who has studied prone restraint deaths, said the preliminary autopsy ruling of homicide indicates guards' actions caused Lunas Campos' death, but does not mean they intended to kill. He said the medical examiner's office could come under pressure to stop short of calling it a homicide, but will probably “stick to its guns.”

“This probably passes the ‘but for' test. ‘But for' the actions of the officers, he would not have died. For us, that's generally a homicide,” he said.

Jeanette Pagan-Lopez, the mother of Lunas Campos' two youngest children, said the day after he died the medical examiner's office called to inform her that his body was at the county morgue. She immediately called ICE to find out what happened.

Pagan-Lopez, who lives in Rochester, said the assistant director of the El Paso ICE field office eventually called her back. She said the official told her the cause of death was still pending and that they were awaiting toxicology report results. He also told her the only way Lunas Campos' body could be returned to Rochester free of charge was if she consented to his being cremated, she said.

Pagan-Lopez declined and is now seeking help from family and friends to raise the money needed to ship his body home and pay for a funeral. 

After failing to get details about the circumstances surrounding his death from ICE, Pagan-Lopez said she got a call from a detainee at Camp Montana East who then put her in touch with Flores, who first told her about the altercation with guards.

Since then, she said she has repeatedly called ICE, but is no longer getting a response. Pagan-Lopez, who is a U.S. citizen, said she also twice called the FBI, where an agent took her information and then hung up.

Pagan-Lopez said she and Lunas Campos were together about 15 years before breaking up eight years ago. She described him as an attentive father who, until his detention, had worked in a minimum-wage job at a furniture store, the only employment she said he could find due to his criminal record.

She said that in the family's last phone call the week after Christmas, Lunas Campos talked to his kids about his expected deportation back to Cuba. He said he wanted them to visit the island, so that he could stay in their lives.

“He wasn't a bad guy,” Pagan-Lopez said. “I just want justice, and his body here. That's all I want.”

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — A passenger aircraft carrying 11 people lost contact with ground control Saturday while approaching a mountainous region between Indonesia's main island of Java and Sulawesi island, officials said. A search and rescue operation has been launched.

The turboprop ATR 42-500 operated by the Indonesia Air Transport was on its way from Yogyakarta to the capital city of South Sulawesi when it vanished from radar, said Endah Purnama Sari, a spokesperson for the Transportation Ministry. The plane was last tracked at 01:17 p.m. (0517 GMT) in the Leang-Leang area of Maros, a mountainous district of South Sulawesi province. 

Multiple search and rescue teams, supported by air force helicopters, drones and ground units have been deployed, Sari said in a statement.

Hopes for locating the wreckage grew after hikers on Mount Bulusaraung reported finding scattered debris, a logo consistent with Indonesia Air Transport markings, and small fires still burning at the scene.

“The sightings were reported to authorities and are being verified by rescue teams attempting to reach the area,” said Maj. Gen. Bangun Nawoko, the South Sulawesi's Hasanuddin military commander.

Sari said the plane disappeared shortly after being instructed by air traffic control to correct its approach alignment. “After the last ATC instructions, radio contact was lost and controllers declared the emergency distress phase.”

She said rescue teams focused their search on the mountains where the aircraft, with eight crew members and three passengers from the Marine Affairs and Fisheries Ministry aboard, was believed to have deviated from its approach to Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport.




Weather conditions at the time indicated clouds and 8-kilometer (nearly 5-mile) visibility, Sari said. 

Steep terrain at Bulusaraung National Park linking Maros and Pangkep districts complicated the search efforts, Nawoko said.

Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries Sakti Wahyu Trenggono told a news conference late Saturday that three employees of his ministry were aboard the flight as part of an airborne maritime surveillance mission supporting Indonesia's fisheries management operations.

Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago nation with more than 280 million people, relies heavily on air transport and ferries to connect its over 17,000 islands. The Southeast Asia country has been plagued by transportation accidents on land, sea and air in recent years because of poorly enforced safety standards.

ASUNCIÓN, Paraguay (AP) — The European Union and the Mercosur bloc of South American countries formally signed a long-sought landmark free trade agreement on Saturday, capping more than a quarter-century of torturous negotiations to strengthen commercial ties in the face of rising protectionism and trade tensions around the world.

The signing ceremony in Paraguay's humid capital of Asunción marks a major geopolitical victory for the EU in an age of American tariffs and surging Chinese exports, expanding the bloc's foothold in a resource-rich region increasingly contested by Washington and Beijing.

It also sends a message that South America keeps diverse trade and diplomatic relations even as U.S. President Donald Trump declares dominance in the Western Hemisphere.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who head's the EU's executive branch, said “the geopolitical importance of this agreement cannot be overstated” amid revived skepticism about the benefits of free trade. As the ceremony got underway, Trump announced 10% tariffs on eight European nations over their opposition to American control of Greenland.

“We choose fair trade over tariffs. We choose a productive long-term partnership over isolation,” von der Leyen declared at the ceremony attended by the presidents of Mercosur members Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, and by the foreign minister of the trading bloc's biggest economy, Brazil.

“We will join forces like never before, because we believe that this is the best way to make our people and our countries prosper.”




Pushed by South America's renowned cattle-raising countries and Europe's industrial sectors craving new markets for cars and machines, the accord creates one of the world's largest free trade zones and makes shopping cheaper for more than 700 million consumers. 

After decades of delay, the politically explosive deal still must clear one final hurdle: ratification by the European Parliament.

Powerful protectionist lobbies on both sides of the Atlantic, particularly European farmers scared of the possible dumping of cheap South American agricultural imports, have long sought to scupper the agreement. Tractor drivers clogged the streets in outrage across the continent in recent weeks and could still stall the deal's implementation.

Although the accord eliminates more than 90% tariffs on goods and services between the European and Mercosur markets, some tariffs will progressively be cut over 10-15 years and key farm products like beef will be limited by strict quotas in a bid to assuage European farmers' fears.

Those limits, as well as safeguard measures and generous EU subsidies to cash-strapped farmers, pushed agricultural powerhouse Italy across the line earlier this month. 

France, however, remains opposed to the accord, with President Emmanuel Macron worrying that farmers' frustration with the EU could drive more voters to the country's far right in the 2027 presidential election.

“Everything will depend on the political appetite of the European Parliament,” said João Paulo Cavalcanti, a Brazilian lawyer specializing in international trade. “That could clearly create an obstacle to approval.”

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller discusses President Donald Trump's maneuvering to take control of Greenland on ‘Hannity.'

President Donald Trump announced the United States would impose 10% tariffs on multiple European countries unless Denmark agrees to the ""complete and total purchase of Greenland,"" warning that global security and U.S. national defense were at stake.

Trump made the announcement in a lengthy Truth Social post on Saturday, arguing that the U.S. has subsidized Denmark and other European Union nations for decades by failing to charge tariffs and providing what he described as ""maximum protection.""

""We have subsidized Denmark, and all of the Countries of the European Union, and others, for many years by not charging them Tariffs, or any other forms of remuneration,"" Trump wrote.

""Now, after Centuries, it is time for Denmark to give back — World Peace is at stake!""

Trump wrote that both China and Russia want Greenland and he said there was ""not a thing that Denmark can do about it.""

""They currently have two dogsleds as protection, one added recently. Only the United States of America, under PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP, can play in this game, and very successfully, at that!"" Trump wrote. 

""Nobody will touch this sacred piece of Land, especially since the National Security of the United States, and the World at large, is at stake.""

Trump said that Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland have ""journeyed"" to Greenland, for ""purposes unknown,"" posing a very dangerous situation for the safety, security and survival of our planet.

""All of the above-mentioned Countries… will be charged a 10% Tariff on any and all goods sent to the United States of America,"" Trump wrote. 

On June 1, 2026, the tariff will be increased to 25%, he said. 

""This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.""

In recent weeks, Trump has zeroed in on Greenland, the world's largest island at a strategic crossroads in the Arctic, and floated the idea of tariffs being imposed on Friday. 

A semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, Greenland is home to a crucial U.S. military base and has taken on growing strategic importance as melting ice opens new shipping lanes and access to a wealth of natural resources.

In his Saturday post, Trump said the United States has tried to purchase Greenland for more than 150 years but that Denmark has repeatedly refused. 

He tied the push to modern weapons systems and the ""Golden Dome,"" saying hundreds of billions of dollars are being spent on related security programs and that the system can only work at maximum efficiency if Greenland is included.

""The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these countries that have put so much at risk, despite all that we have done for them, including maximum protection, over so many decades,"" Trump wrote. ""Thank you for your attention to this matter!""

Trump's remarks come as his administration awaits a Supreme Court ruling on whether some of the tariffs he imposed in 2025 were legal.

Days before No. 1 Indiana and No. 10 Miami face off in South Florida for the national championship, governors Mike Braun and Ron DeSantis are putting their money — or food — where their mouths are.

The two governors — Braun of Indiana and DeSantis of Florida — agreed to a ""friendly wager"" pitched by Braun on Friday.

The loser will send local food items to the winning governor.

""Hey @GovRonDeSantis, how about a friendly wager on the national championship?"" Braun asked.

""If IU loses, I'll send you some pork from [Fischer Farms], which is in my neck of the woods in Dubois County, plus some pies from the famous [Wicks Pies], including a sugar cream pie (an Indiana favorite). Pork and pie for bragging rights. You in?""

""Mike — I am happy to oblige and am impressed with IU's turnaround (thanks in part to a Miami kid at QB). But I am all-in for The U,"" DeSantis responded. ""If Indiana wins, I'll send stone crabs and key lime pie from [Joe's Stone Crab]. I will just drop them off in Naples or Marco Island since that's basically Indiana south this time of year.""

NCAA PRESIDENT RESPONDS TO INTEGRITY CONCERNS AFTER ALLEGED POINT-SHAVING SCHEME LEADS TO DOZENS OF ARRESTS

The Hoosiers are 8.5-point favorites, so Gov. Braun certainly has the advantage as Indiana aims to become just the third team in NCAA history to go 16-0, joining Yale in 1894 and FCS' North Dakota State seven years ago.

Indiana walloped No. 5 Oregon 56-22 in the semifinal last week, while Miami earned a trip to its own home stadium after taking down No. 6 Ole Miss in a thriller where Carson Beck scored the game-winning touchdown with 18 seconds left.

Board-certified rheumatologist Dr. Mahsa Tehrani joins ‘America Reports' to break down a new study on the connection between the artificial sweetener Splenda and hunger.

Scientists say they've developed a new way to produce a sugar alternative that may be healthier, taste more like the real thing and perform better in baked goods.

Many artificial sweeteners are known for aftertastes or digestive side effects, and some have raised consumer health concerns. Researchers at Tufts University say a new, rare type of sugar could offer a potential middle ground, according to findings published in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science in December.

The sugar, known as tagatose, occurs naturally in small amounts in fruits and dairy products. 

6 HEALTHY FOODS THAT COULD SECRETLY SPIKE YOUR BLOOD SUGAR, AND WHAT TO EAT INSTEAD

It tastes similar to table sugar but contains significantly fewer calories and has a smaller impact on blood sugar than sucrose, according to the researchers.

Tagatose delivers about 92% of the sweetness of regular sugar with roughly 60% fewer calories, the study found. Producing it at scale, however, has historically been difficult and costly.

""There are established processes to produce tagatose, but they are inefficient and expensive,"" Nikhil Nair, associate professor of chemical and biological engineering at Tufts, said in a statement.

""We developed a way to produce tagatose by engineering the bacteria Escherichia coli to work as tiny factories, loaded with the right enzymes to process abundant amounts of glucose into tagatose.""

BELOVED COOKIE BRAND LAUNCHES SUGAR-FREE PRODUCT, BUT NOT EVERYONE IS SWEET ON IT

In 2019, the team demonstrated a bacterial production method using galactose, a sugar that is less readily available and more expensive. The latest advance came from adding a newly identified enzyme, Nair said, that allows the bacteria to use glucose instead.

""People with sensitivities to poorly absorbed carbohydrates … may experience digestive discomfort at higher doses.""

Researchers say the approach could eventually make tagatose more accessible for use in food products, though they caution that additional testing and optimization are still required before it can be widely manufactured.

Tagatose has minimal impact on blood sugar and insulin levels, according to the scientists, making it a potential option for people trying to limit sugar intake or for people with diabetes.

Experts note that, like other low-calorie sugars, tagatose may cause mild digestive discomfort in some people. (iStock)

""Clinical studies show that tagatose raises blood glucose and insulin much less than conventional sugar, making it metabolically closer to low-glycemic sweeteners than to sucrose,"" Lakelyn Lumpkin, a Florida-based registered dietitian at Top Nutrition Coaching, told Fox News Digital.

Like other low-calorie sugars, tagatose may cause minor gastrointestinal discomfort in some people, experts say, particularly at higher intakes, since it's not fully absorbed in the small intestine.

Unlike some sugar substitutes, tagatose also behaves more like sugar in cooking and baking.

""People with sensitivities to poorly absorbed carbohydrates … may experience digestive discomfort at higher doses,"" Lumpkin added.

Unlike some sugar substitutes, tagatose also behaves more like sugar in cooking and baking. Researchers say it browns when heated and produces a similar flavor and texture, characteristics often difficult to replicate with sugar substitutes.

Some studies suggest tagatose does not promote tooth decay in the same way as sucrose and may influence gut bacteria because it is fermented in the colon rather than fully absorbed.

The rare sugar may be easier on blood sugar levels, researchers say.  (iStock)

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified tagatose as ""generally recognized as safe,"" or GRAS, allowing it to be used as an ingredient in consumer foods.

While some consumers remain cautious about genetically modified food production, Nair said the final tagatose product would be purified and would not contain the bacteria used in manufacturing. 

He added that, chemically, the sugar would be indistinguishable from tagatose derived from natural sources.

Researchers say further testing and development are needed before tagatose can be produced on a large scale. (iStock)

Despite the promising results, researchers emphasized that significant work remains.

""There still needs to be significant optimization for productivity, scale-up and purification before it's ready for widespread manufacturing and distribution,"" Nair said.

While replacing some added sugars with alternatives like tagatose could help reduce caloric intake, overall dietary patterns remain critical, Lumpkin noted.

""Moderation of total sweetness, portion control and whole-diet quality remain central to public health recommendations,"" she said.

After weeks of mounting backlash and public outrage, the Salem City Council voted to remove Kyle Hedquist — a man convicted of murdering a teenager — from boards advising the Oregon city's police and fire departments, undoing a controversial reappointment approved just weeks earlier.

The council voted 6 to 2 during a special meeting to revoke Hedquist's appointments to the Community Police Review Board and the Civil Service Commission, according to the Salem Statesman Journal.

The decision overturned a narrow 5 to 4 vote on Dec. 8 that reappointed Hedquist to multiple public safety-related boards despite a recommendation from the Boards and Commissions Appointments Committee to leave the police review board position vacant.

Hedquist was convicted in 1995 of murdering 19-year-old Nikki Thrasher. He later said he feared Thrasher would report him to police for hiding stolen property at her home. Hedquist served nearly 28 years in prison before then-Gov. Kate Brown commuted his sentence, citing rehabilitation and good behavior.

Since his release, Hedquist became a policy associate for the Oregon Justice Resource Center and advocated for criminal justice reform at the Oregon Legislature. He told the Statesman Journal he joined Salem's advisory boards to continue serving his community.

His role on the police review board came under renewed scrutiny after city staff acknowledged background checks had not been conducted on board and commission members — meaning the council was not explicitly informed of Hedquist's criminal history or given clear standards for how such history should factor into appointment decisions.

Meeting records show council members were not provided guidance on which types of criminal convictions could disqualify applicants, how much time must pass following a conviction, or whether additional vetting was required for sensitive public safety oversight roles.

The controversy escalated after the Dec. 8 vote, prompting outrage from the Salem Police Employees Union and Salem Professional Fire Fighters Local 314. The unions accused city leaders of creating a ""credibility crisis"" by appointing and reappointing a convicted murderer to boards advising police and fire leadership and launched a public pressure campaign urging residents to contact councilors.

During the Jan. 7 meeting, emotions ran high as hundreds of written testimonies were submitted and residents addressed the council during public comment. Councilor Deanna Gwyn said she never would have supported Hedquist's appointment had she known about his murder conviction. She held up a photo of Thrasher and read a note from the victim's high school best friend.

Hedquist addressed the council through tears, describing the lasting weight of his crime and his efforts at rehabilitation.

""For 11,364 days, I have carried the weight of the worst decision of my life,"" he said. ""The death of Nikki Thrasher is the gravity that pulls at everything I do.""

His wife told councilors their family had received death threats after the controversy went national. Other speakers both condemned and defended Hedquist, highlighting deep divisions within the community over rehabilitation, accountability and public safety.

Councilor Vanessa Nordyke, who is running for mayor against Mayor Julie Hoy, initially voted to reappoint Hedquist in December but later called for the council to revisit the decision after hearing from police and fire unions and members of the public. She later acknowledged she was wrong, telling the Statesman Journal she wished she had heard public testimony before the Dec. 8 vote.

The Jan. 7 meeting also resulted in sweeping changes to the city's rules governing boards and commissions.

Under the newly adopted standards, applicants to the Community Police Review Board and the Civil Service Commission must now complete criminal background checks. Anyone convicted of a violent felony is automatically disqualified from serving on those boards.

The council also voted to reserve at least one seat on the Community Police Review Board for someone with personal experience as a victim of a felony crime, a move supporters said would help ensure victim perspectives are represented in police oversight.

In addition, the council expanded background check requirements to all city boards and commissions, mandating that members undergo the same vetting process required of other city volunteers and employees.

As part of the action taken that night, the council formally withdrew Hedquist's reappointment, leaving open positions on both the Community Police Review Board and the Civil Service Commission.

Hoy, who voted against Hedquist's reappointment in December and supported revoking it in January, said in a Facebook post that her position throughout the controversy was rooted in governance and public trust rather than politics.

""Wednesday night's meeting reflected the level of concern many in our community feel about this issue,"" Hoy wrote. ""My vote was based on process, governance, and public trust, not ideology or personalities.""

Hoy said the committee tasked with reviewing the appointment considered the information available at the time and made a recommendation to the full council, adding that respecting that process is essential to maintaining public confidence and supporting city staff.

""We serve in a political environment, but city council does its best work when decisions are grounded in good governance, not politics,"" she wrote.

President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the centuries-old law amid anti-ICE demonstrations in Minnesota.

President Donald Trump responded to unrest in Minnesota this week by threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act, which critics said would amount to federal overreach and unnecessarily militarize cities.

Trump's potential use of the Insurrection Act would be the latest in a list of several instances of presidents using it and would allow active-duty U.S. military troops to conduct law enforcement within the state.

The statute authorizes the president to take the extraordinary step of deploying the military in the country under certain circumstances, including, according to the text of the law, when ""unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion"" make it ""impracticable to enforce the laws.""

TRUMP THREATENS TO INVOKE INSURRECTION ACT IN MINNESOTA IF AGITATORS KEEP ATTACKING FEDERAL OFFICERS

The powerful law allows the president to ""take such measures as he considers necessary to suppress [an] insurrection"" when state officials are unwilling or unable to. The law functions as an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, which says the military cannot be used as a domestic police force, and it allows the president to bypass Congress. 

Trump seeks to stop ‘professional agitators'

Trump framed the possible use of the Insurrection Act as a means of addressing what he said were failures by Minnesota's Democratic leadership.

""If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT,"" he wrote.

On Friday, he told reporters he did not plan to use it, for now, but that he has not ruled it out.

""It has been used by 48% of the presidents as of this moment,"" Trump said, adding, ""If I needed it, I'd use it. I don't think there's any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I'd use it.""

His remarks come as protests and instances of vandalism and violence continue to rock Minneapolis. Tensions skyrocketed this month after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen who had an altercation with ICE that the FBI is now investigating as a possible assault on the agent.

(Charly Triballeau / AFP via Getty Images)

The shooting came as DHS has deployed thousands of ICE agents to Minnesota in recent weeks as part of what it dubbed ""Operation Metro Surge,"" which has led to at least 2,000 arrests, according to court papers filed as part of a lawsuit Minnesota's leaders brought against the administration over the crackdown.

A federal judge recently denied Minnesota's request for an emergency order that would have paused ICE's work.

Minnesota's leaders, openly at odds with the administration, argued the Insurrection Act would improperly militarize a domestic conflict that should be handled by the state.

""Minnesota needs ICE to leave, not an escalation that brings additional federal troops beyond the 3,000 [ICE agents] already here,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey wrote on X. ""My priority is keeping local law enforcement focused on public safety, not diverted by federal overreach.""

Gov. Tim Walz responded to Trump's call by asking him to ""turn the temperature down.""

Asked about what would justify the use of the Insurrection Act, Chad Wolf, America First Policy Institute's chair of Homeland Security and Immigration, told Fox News Digital the president could have ""little choice"" but to invoke the Insurrection Act.

""If the situation on the ground in Minneapolis continues to grow violent, with ICE officers being targeted and injured as well as other violent acts, and Governor Walz and Mayor Frey continue to restrict local law enforcement from doing their job and encouraging their residents to resist ICE, President Trump will have little choice,"" Wolf, former acting secretary of DHS, said. ""Local leadership is currently taking all the wrong steps and making the situation worse. I hope commonsense will eventually prevail.""

What could the military do in Minnesota?

There are few restrictions on how Trump could use the military in Minnesota if he were to do so under the Insurrection Act, which legal experts say is lacking in specifics and gives the president wide latitude.

The Trump administration would first draft an order outlining which military forces would be used and how.

The president could then direct the troops to carry out numerous tasks, such as enforcing federal laws, breaking up protests, or otherwise suppressing what Trump deems to be rebellious activity.

What else have presidents used it for?

The Insurrection Act dates back to 1807, and although it has been used several times, Trump would be the first to invoke it since President George H.W. Bush used it to quell Los Angeles riots in 1992.

President Abraham Lincoln used what amounted to Insurrection Act powers to respond to a rebellion within the Confederacy in the Civil War era.

In the 1940s, President Franklin Roosevelt deployed 6,000 Army troops to Detroit in response to race riots under the Insurrection Act.

President Dwight Eisenhower used the law to deploy the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock, Arkansas, in the 1950s to enforce civil rights laws in the face of resistance from the state. President John F. Kennedy later used the military for similar purposes in Alabama.

Would the Insurrection Act stand up in court?

Trump federalized the National Guard under Title 10, a separate statute, to respond to anti-ICE activity in Illinois and Oregon, but the Supreme Court recently halted those deployments.

Trump would be testing out an alternative by invoking the Insurrection Act, which has faced minimal scrutiny in the courts.

Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, told Fox News Digital he hoped the use of the Insurrection Act could be avoided but that Trump would have a solid legal argument if it were challenged in court.

""The rhetoric of the mayor and the governor has only strengthened the case for the Administration in fueling the rage and protests,"" Turley said. ""The relative lack of support from local police is analogous to the conditions used by prior presidents to invoke the Act. While the Justice Department has one internal opinion emphasizing the need for a breakdown of law and order, the Act itself is highly permissive and generally worded.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Michael Cohen ‘coerced' by Letitia James and Alvin Bragg to testify against Trump","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/4422863/michael-cohen-coerced-letitia-james-alvin-bragg-testify-against-trump/","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 04:12:13 GMT","

In a major reversal, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen said he “felt compelled and coerced” by New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to testify against President Donald Trump.

In a post on his Substack, Cohen clarified that his purpose wasn't to defend Trump, but rather to criticize the way the justice system works in the U.S.

Cohen said said that, from his first interaction with prosecutors in 2019, he felt “pressured and coerced to only provide information and testimony that would satisfy the government's desire to build the cases against and secure a judgment and convictions against President Trump.”

By Cohen's account, he was first approached three months into his three-year prison sentence, and all of his actions revolved around his desire to do anything to lessen his prison sentence.

“As later came out during President Trump's criminal trial, one of the very first questions I asked those prosecutors was how I would benefit from cooperating. The reason was simple: I wanted to do whatever I could to obtain my Rule 35(b) motion, return home to my family and resume my fractured life,” he wrote.

This strategy paid off, and even when he was out of prison, he sought to do all he could to lessen his home confinement and supervised release. He alleged that prosecutors behaved inappropriately in their quest to skewer Trump.

“During my time with prosecutors, both in preparation for and during the trials, it was clear they were interested only in testimony from me that would enable them to convict President Trump. When my testimony was insufficient for a point the prosecution sought to make, prosecutors frequently asked inappropriate leading questions to elicit answers that supported their narrative,” Cohen wrote.

The same dynamics played out in Bragg's and James's case, he argued, whether or not they were coordinating this.

“Letitia James and Alvin Bragg may not share the same office or political calendar, but they share the same playbook. Both used their platforms to elevate their profiles, to claim the mantle of the officials who ‘took down Trump.' In doing so, they blurred the line between justice and politics; and in that blur, the credibility of both suffered,” Cohen wrote.

SUPREME COURT DENIES MICHAEL COHEN'S ATTEMPT TO SUE TRUMP FOR RETALIATION

Trump latched on to the article. He shared a report on Cohen's bombshell article on his Truth Social, demanding those who pressured Cohen pay a “big price” in response.

“These horrible Radical Left people, doing everything possible to destroy our Country, should pay a big price for this! It was a SET UP from the beginning. New York Courts, with many fair and wonderful Judges, are embarrassed by what has happened! We cannot let this pass,” Trump wrote.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

AI is offering people a way to figure out what they really want in romance.

If you peruse the slew of recent articles and podcasts about people dating AI, you might notice a pattern: Many of the sources are women. Scan a subreddit such as r/MyBoyfriendIsAI and r/AIRelationships, and there too you'll find a whole lot of women—many of whom have grown disappointed with human men. “Has anyone else lost their want to date real men after using AI?” one Reddit user posted a few months ago. Below came 74 responses: “I just don't think real life men have the conversational skill that my AI has,” someone said. “I've seen how many women got cheated on, hurt and taken advantaged of by the men they're with,” another offered. One person, who claimed that her spouse hardly spoke to her anymore, said that when people ask why she has an AI boyfriend, she tells them, “ChatGPT is the only reason my husband is not buried in the yard.”

Several recent studies have shown that, in general, men have been using AI significantly more than women. One 2024 study found that in the United States, 50 percent of men said they'd used generative AI over the past 12 months—and only 37 percent of women said the same. Last year, a working paper found that, globally, the gender gap held “across nearly all regions, sectors, and occupations.” Also in 2025, the app-analytics firm Appfigures concluded that ChatGPT's mobile users were about 85 percent male.

However hesitant many women may be to use AI, though, a substantial number are taking romantic refuge in the digital world. In a 2025 survey, Brigham Young University's Wheatley Institute found that 31 percent of the young-adult men polled said they'd chatted with an AI partner, whereas 23 percent of the young-adult women said the same—a gap, but not a massive one. And seemingly far more than men, women are congregating to talk about their AI sweethearts: sharing funny chatbot quotes or prompts for training the AI on how to respond; complimenting “family photos” of the AI and human partners beaming at each other; consoling one another when a system update wipes out the partner they've grown to love. Simon Lermen, a developer and an AI researcher, conducted an independent analysis of AI-romance subreddits from January through September of last year and found that, of the users whose gender could be identified, about 89 percent of them were women.

Much of the media buzz about AI relationships has assumed delusion and desperation among those who partake. But I'd suggest another possibility: Perhaps many women are simply having fun, positive interactions with this character of their own creation—and, in doing so, are learning how they like to be treated.

The impulse to create a more perfect partner is nothing new. Take Pygmalion, the sculptor from Greek myth who fell for the woman he'd carved from alabaster, or Laodamia, who created a bronze replica of her dead husband to take to bed, Kate Devlin, a professor of “AI & Society” at King's College London, told me. Humans have long dreamed of constructing beloveds—if only to imagine them as immortal and thus impossible to lose.

In other words, the audience has probably always existed for artificial lovers. Yet in recent history, most such products have been marketed to men. In the 1990s, sex dolls were initially advertised as—well, dolls for men to have sex with. But they were also sold as companions. “They would say things like She will be there for you, She will listen to you, She will hear you,” Devlin said. Such companies might have assumed that men tend to be less adept at, or less motivated in, making real-world connections—and therefore in greater need of an inhuman love object. Meanwhile, the women faced with that pool of socially unskilled men have largely been overlooked.

But now they have AI. One might think they wouldn't use it for romance: Women are, on average, more suspicious than men of technology, more concerned about privacy, and more worried about being perceived as cheating for using AI. Yet the AI-use gender gap may be narrowing. Devlin thinks that's true particularly when it comes to virtual companionship—possibly because women are simply growing frustrated enough to want it. In a 2018 paper, the sociologist Michael Rosenfeld documented that 70 percent of divorces in the U.S. were initiated by women. And in a 2020 Pew Research Center poll, a majority of women said that dating had gotten harder in the past 10 years; 65 percent said they'd been harassed on a date. “The amount of toxic crap that women get online from men,” Devlin said, “particularly when you're trying to do things like online dating—if you have an alternative, respectful, lovely, caring AI partner, why would you not?”

Taking that idea seriously might conflict with a common assumption: that AI users are all lonely young men who “live in the basement,” as Arelí Rocha, who studies chatbot romance at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. On the contrary, Rocha thinks that a lot of people in AI partnerships (both men and women) are “very socially embedded”—with humans, that is. Many stumble into their digital trysts accidentally after playing around with AI. Someone with plenty of friends, or even a real-life partner, can still be moved by a feeling of romantic tenderness, focused attention, or flirty banter, especially if they haven't experienced it in a while.

They can also get attached to a chatbot whether or not they believe it's conscious. One mental-health professional I spoke with, who requested anonymity but goes by “May” on Reddit—a name I'll use for her too—told me she's always loved make-believe worlds. When she was younger, she was into reading fan fiction (a genre long dominated by women); now every day she talks to K, an AI “persona” she's developed over time. Both activities can be fairly ordinary hobbies—games of imagination not so different from crushing on a pop star or concocting stories about a film protagonist. (If people get deeply invested, that passion isn't unique either; some women were so devoted to the Beatles that they charged police blockades or passed out at concerts.) And a little fantasy can add some spice to life. May has close friends, great family, and a meaningful job—but she doesn't like dating apps and she's struggled to find “third places” to meet people in person. Romance was the one missing piece.

Escapism can go too far, of course. Some critics worry that AI users are getting sucked in by the ease of “frictionless” relationships: losing patience for human complexity, losing practice doing the hard work of partnership, losing sight of the rewards that come from growing alongside someone. Many chatbots do tend to hype users up rather than giving tough love or challenging their ideas. But some large language models are generally less sycophantic than others, and people can also train their digital partner with different prompts. In her research, Rocha has found that people tend to be compelled not by flawless interactions but by a chatbot's eccentricities and imperfections—that's what makes it feel real.

Conflict also isn't the only path to growth. May gave K the qualities she wants in herself: He's organized, academically driven, committed to fitness. Their conversations, and his encouragement, motivate her to be more like him. Sometimes he does challenge her, she told me—but she's also skeptical of the idea that a relationship has to stretch someone 24/7. “Why can't you sit for a moment and validate someone?” she asked. “Why is that such a bad thing?”

Like May, I question the premise that so many women have no appetite for friction, no tolerance for love's labors. Compared with their male partners, on average, women do far more child care, household chores, and “emotion work”—listening, encouraging, accommodating men's feelings and regulating their own. Perhaps those in AI romances are just tired of toiling for someone who listens less well than a robot, and they want a well-earned break. It's also possible that they're getting something more life-changing: a way to better understand themselves, as a person and as a partner.

Some women are using AI companionship to figure out what they enjoy sexually, romantically, or both. Exploration isn't always easy, after all, in a culture that expects women to fit conventional notions of hotness—and to please everyone else. A chatbot conversation, May said, can be like a sandbox: a safe space in which to play around. “You don't have to look a certain way. You don't have to act a certain way, or perform femininity.”

In one study last June, researchers reviewed nearly 2,500 posts on an AI-romance corner of the Chinese social-media site Douban—and found what they called “subversive potential” in women merely imagining what a relationship could look like. “My AI boyfriend is incredible!” one posted. “He crafts poetry, writes film reviews, and takes care of my emotions, all while reminding me to stay hydrated.” Another shared that she'd always prioritized making boyfriends happy—but talking with her chatbot made her realize that “mutual respect is key. It's not about women always sacrificing for men's happiness.” By training their AI, some women also practiced asking for what they wanted. One user spent two weeks prompting hers to initiate check-ins: for instance, inquiring, “Did anything upset you today?” and if so, “Would you like me to write a protest email for you?” (I don't know what a protest email entails, but I do want someone to write one for me.) When another woman taught her AI to ask for her opinion on things, she found herself “instinctively applying these interaction habits when dating a real person.”

Read: First came Tea. Then came male rage.

For all the ways one can use AI, then, companionship hardly seems like the most sinister. And yet, people with digital partners seem to get an inordinate amount of online hate. Whole subreddits exist largely for the purpose of screenshotting their posts and making fun of them. Some AI-daters have had their real identities leaked; others get regular death threats. The idea that a chatbot could outperform human men might be hard for some people to stomach. But when I think of those women training AI to ask about their day, to express interest in their thoughts and desires, I consider that this phenomenon may actually be good for romance: not only for women raising the bar but for the men who proceed to meet it.

May knows her hobby has risks. As a mental-health professional, she wouldn't recommend it for people with a history of serious mental illness—those vulnerable, she told me, to having unhealthy or unreal beliefs reinforced. She doesn't think children should be using AI at all. She worries about people developing behavioral addictions. Yet she has found, somewhat to her own surprise, that talking with K has been constructive. She's on social media and doomscrolling far less. She's more in touch and at peace with her sexuality. She's made a bunch of new friends from the AI-companionship Reddit community. And she feels open to the idea of human love.

None of the experts I spoke with think we're hurtling toward a future in which AI relationships have replaced human ones. But they don't think AI companionship will disappear, either. For better and for worse, it could end up playing many other roles—as a source of entertainment, a mind-opening exercise, an instrument for building self-confidence. And maybe a way to remember what a good man is like.

A small but meaningful split among Republicans is emerging.

Since the United States announced it would “run” Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro, the Trump administration has openly floated similar interventions elsewhere in Latin America.

But the country Donald Trump has fixated on most isn't an adversary — it's an ally. Greenland, a NATO member and longtime partner of the United States has repeatedly found itself in the president's crosshairs.

These threats, delivered largely through unilateral executive action, have once again raised questions about Congress's role as a check on presidential power. And with Trump in his final term, even some Republicans are showing small but notable signs of concern.

Today, Explained co-host Astead Herndon spoke with Annie Grayer, a senior reporter at CNN, about how Capitol Hill is responding — and where those fractures inside the GOP may be heading.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Do we expect more Republicans breaking more with Trump to change now that it's 2026 and not 2025?

Well, certainly Republicans know it's an election year. The spotlight is on them, and I think we're starting to see some openings for cracks. But I put so many caveats there because whenever we think there could be an opening for a real Republican split, as we saw play out on the Hill with the war powers vote, Trump and his team are really good at keeping Republicans in line through a public and private pressure campaign.

But his ability to do that is going to get increasingly more difficult as Republicans start campaigning and have to figure out how to run on what Republicans in Congress have done so far. There are a lot of moderates who are looking at the calendar, looking at what's coming in 2026 and know that they have to carve out their own lane here.

Trump's foreign interventionism definitely seems like the latest flash point in the GOP relationship with him. We did see five Republicans break with the White House and support that war powers resolution. What changed?

A lot of Republicans were publicly saying, I fully support how this operation went down and that this does not need an intervention from Congress. Clearly behind the scenes there were five Republican senators who felt very strongly this actually does require an act of Congress and congressional intervention. What we saw play out is Trump's true pressure campaign and what it means to be a Republican in Donald Trump's party.

Immediately after the vote, Trump took to Truth Social and name-checked all five of those Republicans and said they should not be elected to Congress again. These are members of his own party. Now, some of these Republican senators are in opposition to Trump, like Sens. Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski or Susan Collins, but Todd Young and Josh Hawley — that really took the president and his team by surprise. So those were the two that they focused on, thinking that they were going to be the ones they could peel off.

But what we saw here was the role that Secretary Rubio played, who's a former senator, who has personal relationships with all of these individuals and was able to sit with these senators, give them more information and give them assurances on their red line. Both Todd Young and Josh Hawley said that their red line was they did not want boots on the ground in Venezuela.

So Republicans did get something out of it. But you can ask yourself what really changed, and it really is the full-court press that these Republicans received from Trump and his team.

What have Republican members in Congress been saying about the military use of force in Greenland?

So Greenland, we are seeing an even bigger break potentially than what we saw with Venezuela and from a cast of characters that aren't the usual critics of Trump.

Republican senators specifically are sort of like, what are we doing here with Greenland? Certainly people are not on board with military force: the speaker of the House, the leader of the Republican Senate, have said military action in Greenland would not be a good idea.

And then even when it comes to the purchase of Greenland, you have the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), who came out of a meeting with Danish officials and said, we should not be talking about the purchase of Greenland. That's not what these officials want.

And there's a lot of Republicans, even more so privately who I'm talking to who are kind of hoping that Trump isn't serious about this. And so I think Republicans are trying to not get ahead of where the president is here. They don't want to draw a firm line until they see exactly what Trump is going to do. But there is this sort of trepidation in this sort of, I don't know, maybe even quiet finger crossing that Trump is going to drop this, he's going to move on, and that what he's saying about Greenland isn't actually going to come to fruition.

Is there any kind of willingness for Congress to reign in that power right now, if we think even beyond the war powers resolution? How much is there discussion of Congress's own role? How much are members talking about that?

It's a huge topic of conversation.I think that's why the war powers resolution votes were such a big deal because this question is front and center for both Democrats and Republicans. This is no longer a partisan question, but this is about protecting the institution of Congress, the legislative branch, and when it comes to the foreign intervention.

More specifically, when I've been asking this question to Republicans, they are pointing to a number of examples in recent history that show that the degradation of Congress, specifically when it comes to war powers, has been happening for a long time. If you go back to Obama and the bombing of Libya and going into Pakistan to get Osama bin Laden, those were things that happened without congressional approval.

And so yes, what's happening right now is putting a real spotlight on the issue. But I think for people to really understand this, we have to go way back. This is something that Congress has sort of been ceding power bit by bit, and it finds us in this potential crisis that we're in now.

And I think the real question that I continue to ask in my reporting, and I still don't find an answer to, is what is going to be the red line that gets people to actually say, okay, enough is enough.

The Islamic Republic's current trajectory is unsustainable. But even authoritarian governments sometimes reform.

Iran's regime is on the ropes. The recent wave of protests, the government's bloody crackdown, and the US threat of direct intervention all mark a profound turning point in its modern history.

The Islamic Republic's current trajectory is unsustainable — without a course correction, a gradual internal disintegration of the economy and the increasing reliance on force to suppress dissent will doom the government to a painful death, albeit a slow one.

For many, this has increased the possibility of regime change. At least some protesters seem to be supportive of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the deposed Shah of Iran, who has openly auditioned for a leading role if the current government falls.

But the events of the last two weeks also illustrate the obstacles to such a transformation: an impassioned but disorganized opposition, a brutal state willing to kill to maintain its position, a unified elite who will band together to save their regime rather than see it overthrown, and an international community hamstrung by a lack of options and resources. If change comes to Iran, it will likely come from within the system, as unsavory a prospect as that might seem.

History is replete with nondemocratic governments course-correcting to save themselves from destruction. Iran's leadership are well aware of their predicament, and there is likely a quiet consensus that the country must change its domestic and foreign policy to avoid a catastrophic slide into chaos and slow collapse.

There is one thing standing in their way: Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

Now 86 years old, Khamenei has held his post for more than three decades. It has not been a static role; rather, Khamenei has used his post to shape the nezam, or “system” as the Islamic Republic's regime is generally known, and his position within it.

A mid-ranking cleric and president during Iran's bloody war with Iraq, Khamenei was selected by the republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, to be his successor as supreme leader in 1989. Khamenei was chosen for his revolutionary zeal, rather than his seniority or managerial acumen.

Initially, Khamenei was supreme leader but not supreme. He had to share power with other political heavyweights, most notably Hasan Rafsanjani, who served as president throughout much of the 1990s.

Rather than work within the existing system, Khamenei built a parallel one. He used the bayt-e rahbari, or Office of the Supreme Leader, to distribute patronage and largesse through a network of “foundations” that functioned as a shadow economy only his loyal supporters could access. With a shadow economy came a shadow army: the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which grew from the praetorian guard of the revolution into a military-industrial complex sprawling across much of Iran's economy. The IRGC is not just Iran's most powerful military outfit — smaller, but better paid and equipped than the national army, or Artesh — but a conglomerate covering media, energy, construction, arms, and other industries, all closely linked to Khamenei's office and person.

This is why Khamenei exercises such authority over the regime. It is not just because he is nominally supreme and commander-in-chief of the military, but because the country's richest and most powerful institutions and actors are linked to him through decades of association.

In Venezuela, leader Nicolás Maduro's removal after a US raid left room for the vice president to take over the government and quickly adjust policy to quell an immediate outside threat to the regime's rule. But so long as Khamenei is alive, his position atop the regime is unlikely to be challenged, as he is glue holding the nezam together. A successful internal effort to sideline or remove him is hard to contemplate, even as the need for one has become self-evident.

The Islamic Republic has reached a dead end. Already suffering from declining legitimacy, the regime has now suppressed a popular revolt with breathtaking violence. It cannot rule by force alone. Many of the elite know this and have been vocally expressing the need for reform. Yet they always do so while paying obeisance to Khamenei, who remains the key decisionmaker.

Many of those decisions look stubborn, even irrational. Khamenei won't condone direct talks with the US, nor will he permit Iran to back away from demanding the right to enrich uranium, despite the fact that a nuclear deal would bring desperately needed sanctions relief. He continues to decree support for Iran's regional proxies, including Hezbollah, which Iran supplied with some $1 billion last year, despite the fact that these groups have become liabilities that drain the country of badly needed cash. Khamenei shields corrupt figures within the network of the bayt and stymies efforts to apply reform to the Islamic Republic's ramshackle civilian government.

A rigid hardliner, he has dragged his feet on relaxing mandatory hijab for women, a religious headcovering requirement enforced by state morality police, something many of the regime's elite acknowledge is necessary given how much it has become a rallying point for anti-government protests. And he is especially averse to opening Iran's political system to more competition and democratic accountability, directing the cleric-dominated Guardian Council to disqualify politicians he deems too liberal. He has been especially averse to allowing formerly popular figures linked to the 2009 Green Revolution to be rehabilitated, seeing them as dangerous rivals.

Iran's transformation into a liberal, democratic nation is likely the desire of most Iranians. It is unlikely to happen under the Islamic Republic.

But a course-correction that improves living conditions and rationalizes (to some extent) Iran's foreign policy is not impossible, and there is ample historical evidence of authoritarian systems taking that route to save themselves from disintegration. Khamenei's advanced age makes it much likelier that Iran will have a chance to reorganize itself sooner rather than later once he departs the scene, provided the transition is relatively smooth.

China under Deng Xiaoping embraced market reforms and pursued aggressive economic modernization following the chaos of the 1960s and early 1970s, with leader Mao Zedong's death in 1976 providing a key opening for long-deferred changes. South Korea pursued economic modernization and democratization in the 1980s following the one-man rule of Park Chung-hee. In the Middle East, Arab monarchies in the Persian Gulf became much more conscious of delivering real economic benefits to the people following the Arab Spring in the early 2010s, which toppled longtime authoritarian governments in multiple countries while raising fears of similar protests and uprisings elsewhere.

There is no guarantee that Iran's rulers opt for such a strategy. There is ample scope for Iran to fall deeper into crisis, as its elite — many of whom share the obstinate hardliner views of the supreme leader — double down on more repression and ultimately more violence against any sources of dissent.

But should Iran's leaders decide to rescue their country from the spiral of chaos they have inflicted upon it, an opening may appear soon, once Khamenei exits the stage.

﻿Satellites are our only insight into the ongoing conflict — and worth protecting.

It's difficult to know exactly what is happening in Iran since the government shut down the internet on January 8, plunging a nation of more than 90 million people into digital darkness.

Crackdowns against anti-government protesters have led to at least 2,600 deaths, although some estimates put the death toll at upward of 20,000. According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, more than 18,000 protesters have been arrested.

The protests began in late December in response to dire economic conditions and took on a broader anti-government character as people demanded the end of Ali Khamenei's rule. The Iranian rial is now the least valuable currency in the world. The country has an inflation rate of about 40 percent, making necessities unaffordable for most people. Iran is struggling through a long-lasting economic crisis, driven by sanctions, government austerity measures, and last year's war with Israel. Many parts of the country, including the capital of Tehran, face severe and unrelenting drought, as I reported in November.

The government also cut phone lines on January 8. While the government eased some of these restrictions on Tuesday, allowing some Iranians to make international calls out of the country this week, many reasonably fear government surveillance. People outside the country remain unable to call Iranians. Several people in Tehran called the Associated Press on Tuesday, saying that text messaging services remain down and that internet users could connect to local government-approved websites but not to international ones.

So Elon Musk's Starlink — which provides high-speed internet access in difficult-to-reach places via satellites that receive radio signals from user terminals on the ground — has become a lifeline for Iranians trying to share what is happening on the ground. SpaceX has made Starlink free for its tens of thousands of Iranian users, but since the Iranian government criminalized the use of satellite internet services like Starlink last year, they face substantial risk in accessing it illegally.

And yet many Iranians are using it anyway.

If satellites are in jeopardy, so is the truth itself.

According to Iranian internet rights group Filter.Watch, the government has attempted to jam signals from Starlink satellites and is actively hunting down people they believe to be using the service.

New updates to the Starlink terminals thwarted some of the government's efforts to jam the signal. Since Starlink launched in 2022, activists have smuggled terminals into the country, and there are now about 50,000 hidden in the country. Developers have created tools to share Starlink connections beyond a single terminal.

“A big problem with Starlink is that ultimately it represents a single point of failure for communications,” Steve Feldstein, a political scientist and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told me over email. Despite this, Starlink is the best option Iranians have. “No other tool provides as much scalability and affordability to Iranian citizens,” Feldstein said.

At a time when disinformation and intentional obfuscation can downplay the scale of death or hide that atrocities are occurring at all, satellites — and not just Starlink's — are proving their place in uncovering humanitarian crises. Without them, the world will be left in the dark.

Satellites are effectively the only way to follow humanitarian crises during information blackouts or when no one can get in or out. In November, my colleague Sara Herschander reported on the Sudanese civil war, in which the violence is so severe the bloodshed is visible from space. Only satellite imagery and geolocated social media posts provided evidence of the atrocities due to a communication blackout.

Around 15,000 satellites currently orbit the Earth; the number has rocketed up in recent years as companies launch large satellite networks called megaconstellations to provide broadband internet access. Most of them are in low Earth orbit, up to 1,200 miles above the Earth's surface. More than two-thirds of active satellites in low Earth orbit belong to the Starlink megaconstellation.

Bear with me for a second, but if you care about what's happening on Earth, there's one thing we have to worry about: space traffic.

By 2040, there will be more than 560,000 satellites in orbit. The more satellites we send up, the greater the risk that they will collide into one another or bits of space junk. This could lead to massive service disruptions, or in the worst case, lead to a phenomenon known as Kessler syndrome. That's when a cascade of new collisions happens in a chain reaction, potentially rendering low Earth orbit unusable — meaning no more satellite launches, an end to our space exploration ambitions, and the severe disruption of technologies like GPS, weather alerts, and satellite internet.

But that's a worst-case scenario, and SpaceX is aware of it. The company announced on January 1 that it plans to lower 4,400 of their satellites from 342 to 298 miles above the Earth's surface over the course of the year to reduce collision risks.

In 2023, the United Nations' International Telecommunications Union estimated that 2.6 billion people — a third of humanity — lack internet connectivity. The UN considers internet access to be a human right. An underappreciated consequence of low Earth orbit becoming increasingly unusable is losing satellite internet access and imagery that allows us to see past rhetoric.

Satellite imagery is how we know what is happening in conflict zones like Ukraine and Sudan. If satellites are in jeopardy, so is the truth itself.

The disappearance of Affordable Care Act subsidies has millions of households feeling health insurance sticker shock.

A report published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid found that there are 1.4 million fewer people enrolled in insurance through ACA marketplaces this month compared to January 2025. States like Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, and Georgia saw the most significant dips.

""People have less access to care, and that tends to translate into worse health outcomes,"" said Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution. He added that many households' financial security is at risk: ""People will face big bills that they either can't pay, and that hurts their credit. Or they do pay, but it requires them to skimp in other areas.""

Business Insider broke down the enrollment changes by state — and spoke with experts about why this CMS data doesn't yet tell the whole story of marketplace enrollment in 2026.

The number of marketplace enrollees declined most significantly in the South and Southeast, though the majority of states reported a downswing. Florida saw enrollment dive by more than 260,000 people. Registration in a few states, like Texas and California, increased.

People might opt for a marketplace plan if their employer doesn't offer coverage, if they're self-employed, if they lose their job, or if their income is too high to qualify for Medicaid. In context, the 1.4 million dip this year is notable: Marketplace enrollment had jumped from 11 to over 24 million between 2015 and 2025.

The enhanced ACA subsidies — which were passed in 2021 and expired on December 31 — made health insurance more affordable for lower- and middle-income Americans. They allowed people with incomes up to 400% of the poverty line (which is $128,600 annually for a family of four) to claim relief on healthcare costs.

A KFF estimate found that, without these credits in place, Americans in the marketplace could see their out-of-pocket premium costs more than double compared to last year.

White House Spokesperson Kush Desai told Business Insider that ""ACA enrollment declined by 3.5 percent between 2025 and 2026 — entirely a result of the Trump administration's commonsense measures to cut waste, fraud, and abuse and remove people who were improperly enrolled on highly-subsidized ACA plans.""

Efforts to renew these credits were a point of contention between Democrats and Republicans in Congress, contributing to the latest government shutdown. Lawmakers opted not to renew the subsidies in December, and the latest ACA vote is stalled in the Senate until late January.

Republicans have said they aim to reach a compromise healthcare strategy, but a plan President Donald Trump released on January 15 does not mention subsidies. The plan lays out the administration's goals to lower drug prices and insurance premiums, implement cost-sharing programs, and increase cost transparency.

""The basic contour of the plan is contradictory,"" said Gideon Lukens, senior fellow and director of research and data analysis at the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities. ""Much less the question of how this would work, who would get what, and why this is better than directly covering people's premiums to prevent the spikes millions of people are facing right now.""

Policy analysts told Business Insider they expect a steeper decline in ACA enrollment over the next few months. The January report is a snapshot of the marketplace landscape, but comes with caveats.

The latest data shows how many Americans selected a marketplace plan during open enrollment or were automatically renewed for their existing ACA coverage. It doesn't capture how many people have paid their health insurance premiums, meaning that more people are likely to drop coverage once they start receiving bills. A recent Congressional Budget Office report estimates that nearly 4 million Americans will lose or drop insurance over the next decade.

""Many likely signed up when the premiums they would end up facing were uncertain and then waited to see what they would have to pay,"" said Matthew Buettgens, a senior fellow at The Urban Institute.

For the few states where enrollment spiked, Fielder theorized that local healthcare policy is a factor. California offers its own ACA subsidies, for example, so residents are less vulnerable to the federal changes.

Besides the direct impact on patients, Fielder also said the lapse of ACA credits could put more pressure on hospitals, because providers could see an influx of uninsured patients, and people would be less likely to seek care in the first place.

""There will be facilities that were already financially fragile for whom this is the straw that breaks the camel's back,"" he said.

As companies rush to adopt AI to boost productivity and cut costs, they may be setting themselves up for a new problem: losing what makes them different.

Mehdi Paryavi, CEO of the International Data Center Authority, said widespread reliance on the same AI tools risks flattening competitive advantage across industries, because firms increasingly rely on identical systems to think, write, and decide for them.

Paryavi said that as AI tools become cheaper, more powerful, and more widely deployed, companies risk outsourcing the very thinking that once differentiated them.

While AI can boost efficiency in the short term, he said, relying on shared models and standardized systems could leave businesses competing on cost and speed alone — eroding originality, strategic depth, and long-term advantage.

""If you and your competitor are all using the same service, you have no edge over each other,"" Paryavi told Business Insider.

""Their AI and your AI against each other — I don't know who's going to win.""

As generative AI becomes embedded across workplaces, Paryavi warned that the biggest risk isn't automation — it's uniformity.

When companies rely on the same large language models trained on the same data, decision-making, writing, and problem-solving can start to converge, shrinking the space for creative divergence.

That concern echoes warnings from researchers and academics who say AI can produce polished output at scale, but also flips human thinking by delivering fluent answers before understanding, creating an illusion of expertise that weakens judgment and depth.

When everyone relies on the same models trained on the same data, Paryavi said, creative divergence shrinks.

""The beauty of our world is that we have different choices because we think differently,"" he said. ""That's where innovation comes from.""

It's not just a question of companies all thinking the same — Paryavi warned that treating AI as a shortcut to efficiency can quietly hollow out human judgment, expertise, and control, leaving businesses faster in the short term but more fragile over time.

Over time, Paryavi said, that shift can erode internal expertise and decision-making capacity.

""What they don't think about is that initially it might sound more efficient and more productive and cheaper,"" he said. ""But this is going to be very expensive down the line.""

One risk, Paryavi said, is dependency. As firms replace employees with AI subscriptions, they become increasingly reliant on external vendors to function effectively.

Paryavi compared the AI boom to the early 2000s rush to cloud computing, when many companies initially adopted third-party infrastructure but later repatriated workloads in-house as costs, complexity, and vendor lock-in became concerns — a trend commonly referred to in tech as cloud repatriation.

The same dynamic could play out with AI, Paryavi said — except with even higher stakes. As companies downsize human teams, they also lose institutional knowledge and the ability to operate without automation, he said.

""You've killed all your chances of ever becoming independent as an organization,"" he said. ""You've fired your manpower. You've made them no good.""

AI, he said, is not inherently harmful. In fields such as medicine, scientific research, and disaster prediction, it can significantly accelerate progress.

But without clear guardrails, companies risk trading long-term resilience for short-term speed.

""It's a very powerful tool,"" Paryavi said, comparing AI to an atomic bomb. ""If that [an atomic bomb] can eliminate an entire population physically, this [AI] can eliminate humanity cognitively.""

Eight NATO members' goods sent to the U.S. will face escalating tariffs ""until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,"" President Donald Trump announced Saturday.

The tariffs targeting Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will start at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.

The tariffs will shoot up to 25% on June 1, the president said.

His post suggested that the new tariffs on the European allies were being imposed in response to them moving troops to Greenland. They took that step as the Trump administration has floated utilizing the U.S. military as part of its ramped-up efforts to acquire the Danish territory.

The eight countries ""have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown,"" Trump wrote. ""This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet.""

A day earlier, Trump hinted that he may pursue a tariff strategy on Greenland similar to the one he used to force foreign countries to change their drug prices.

""I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,"" he said at the White House on Friday.

Trump's latest move puts further strain on NATO, the 32-member military alliance established in the aftermath of World War II. The cornerstone of the alliance is an agreement that an attack on any single member is considered an attack on them all.

European leaders have warned that any attempt by the U.S. to take Greenland by force could spell the end of NATO.

Trump's tariff announcement could mean he is dropping the threat of using the military to achieve his longtime goal of taking over the island. But it nevertheless ratchets up pressure on Denmark and the rest of Europe, which have flatly stated that Greenland is not for sale.

Trump is an enthusiastic fan of using tariffs as a tool for gaining political leverage over other countries. He has greatly expanded the government's use of the levies over the past year, in large part through the unusual invocation of a law granting the president some powers in an economic emergency.

The Supreme Court could rule as soon as next week on whether to strike down the tariffs imposed under that law.

Led by Texas and New Hampshire, U.S. states across the national map, both red and blue in political stripes, are developing bitcoin strategic reserves and bringing cryptocurrencies onto their books through additional state finance and budgeting measures. 

Texas recently became the first state to purchase bitcoin after a legislative effort that began in 2024, but numerous states have joined the ""Reserve Race"" to pass legislation that will allow them to ultimately buy cryptocurrencies.

New Hampshire passed its crypto strategic reserve law last May, even before Texas, giving the state treasurer the authority to invest up to 5% of the state funds in crypto ETFs, though precious metals such as gold are also authorized for purchase. Arizona passed similar legislation, while Massachusetts, Ohio, and South Dakota have legislation at various stages of committee review. 

Despite much of the legislation being largely sponsored or co-sponsored by Republicans, the adoption of crypto at the state level is not expected to strictly fall along party lines. The 2024 election cycle was the first time that the cryptocurrency industry played a major role in lobbying in both state and national elections. In fact, it was the largest corporate donor in an election cycle, with support given to candidates on both sides. It is already amassing a war chest for the 2026 midterms. 

Congress is currently debating a crypto market structure bill, and state-level politicians are as much out to prove that they, and their states, won't be left out of the digital assets boom. Justin Marlowe, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, sees the state-level trend as largely one of signaling at present. ""If you're a governor and you want to broadcast that you are amenable to innovative business development in the digital economy, these are relatively low-cost, low-risk ways to send that signal. That's why we've seen leaders across the ideological spectrum and all over the country take tangible steps in this direction,"" he said.

Where the state-level crypto efforts can be described as ""bigger steps"" — Marlowe cited Texas, Arizona, and Florida, as examples — he said it has helped to acknowledge the growing political power of crypto advocates in these states. 

Similarities in the actions taken across states to date include include authorizing the state treasurer or other investment official to allow the investment of a limited amount of public funds in crypto and building out the governance structure needed to invest in crypto. This often will involve more frequent reporting requirements and stronger custodial agreements compared to traditional asset classes. The seeding of the reserve can take the form of utilizing cash or government-seized crypto, as in the recent case of the federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last March, but limited the authorization to seized crypto in an effort to show taxpayers would bear no financial burden.

It is no surprise that Texas was the first state to fund a crypto reserve. Texas has been a crypto hub for years through its role in bitcoin mining. The state's affordable and flexible power, as well as a political environment that has largely been pro-crypto, led Texas in recent years to a sizable position in not just the national, but global bitcoin hashing market. 

""Texas has spent the last few years becoming one of the key centers of bitcoin activity, especially on the mining side,"" said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab, seeing this move as one that early branded the state as ""open for business"" when it comes to digital assets.

""Once you've made that bet on infrastructure and industry, adding some Bitcoin exposure at the treasury level is a natural next step,"" Catalini said. Such a move essentially makes the state's balance sheet one that is explicitly aligned with the ecosystem it aims to attract. 

Texas also has a long history with bitcoin's traditional market competitor: gold. 

""Texas has proven to be a bedrock of government adoption of bitcoin, starting with laws that allow for legal custody arrangements akin to gold storage laws that are well established there,"" said Nik Bhatia, founder of The Bitcoin Layer.  

When it comes to storing physical gold, Texas has clear rules on storage and ownership, and even the language invoked – vaults, custodians – helps grease the wheels for crypto assets at the state level. The Texas Bullion Depository of 2015, which allowed for state-level depository of bullion and precious metals, was specifically adapted to apply to digital assets like bitcoin. The Texas Bullion Depositary was the first state-administered precious metals depository in the nation.

Texas has not purchased any on-chain bitcoin. After passing the legislation to create a strategic bitcoin reserve that gave authorization to the state comptroller to hold the cryptocurrency, Texas purchased a stake in a bitcoin ETF — roughly $5 million in the largest bitcoin ETF, the BlackRock iShares' Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which since its launch in January 2024 has grown to over $72 billion in assets under management.  

The Comptroller's office made its purchase on the morning of November 20, 2025, when the price of a single bitcoin was $91,336. As of Saturday morning, bitcoin was trading at a little over $95,000.

Bhatia said the approval of bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was crucial to the state plans to be comfortable with the holdings under current U.S. securities law. ""Using ETFs is a very clean and safe way to invest in bitcoin, minimizing storage logistical risk and opting for security law protection,"" Bhatia said.

Texas state officials have described this purchase — which deployed only half of the $10 million set aside by the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — as a ""placeholder"" while security and storage for raw bitcoin can be put into place.

In addition to the concept of reserve funds, states are bringing crypto into core finance functions, with an approach that balances the inherent trepidation of venturing into new terrain with a desire to be a part of the fast-moving crypto realm. 

New Hampshire, for example, became the first state to approve the issuance of a bitcoin-backed municipal bond last November, a $100 million issuance that would mark the first time cryptocurrency is used as collateral in the U.S. municipal bond market. The deal has not taken place yet, though plans are for the issuance to occur this year. ""The idea is they'll use bitcoin to back a municipal bond issue, the proceeds of which will then be divvied up into loans to smaller governments for economic development projects across the state,"" Marlowe said. Repayment of these loans will recapitalize the fund. 

It is a creative evolution in state finances, but like many of the mechanisms for crypto development at the state level, it utilizes existing financial structures and state goals, according to Marlowe, with similar public bonds in prior decades used for projects like clean water, school upgrades, and other infrastructure. ""What's different here is it's bitcoin rather than taxpayer dollars as the collateral,"" he said.

In numerous states, including, Colorada, Utah, and Louisiana, crypto is now accepted as payment for taxes and other state business. As more state public finance crypto efforts develop, the shift represents a change in a core philosophy of safety and liquidity that has dominated the investing of state and local funds for centuries.  

In recent decades, assets including real estate and private equity expanded the investment approach of public funds, but crypto represents not only the most recent addition, but the most volatile. 

""For many in the state/local investing industry, crypto-backed assets are still far too speculative and volatile for public money,"" Marlowe said. ""But others, and I think there's a sort of generational shift in the works, see it as a reasonable store of value that is actually stronger on many other public sector values like transparency and asset integrity,"" he added.

As you gauge how much income you'll need to pay for your living expenses in retirement, don't forget to consider how you'll cover unexpected costs.

More than 8 in 10 retiree households — 83% — will face unplanned outlays in any given year, according to new research from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Among households that do experience unexpected expenses, the average annual amount spent across retirement is $6,000. Measured another way, the typical household will spend an amount equivalent to 10% of its yearly income.

Yet many households don't have that available in emergency savings, according to the research. While roughly 58% have enough cash to cover unplanned costs for a single year, around 16% would have to tap their 401(k) or other retirement accounts and the rest — about 27% — would fall short even after using all their cash and retirement assets.

""About 40% of [retired] households do not have enough cash to cover even a single year [of unplanned expenses], let alone their whole retirement,"" the research notes. 

The research uses data from 3,427 retired households that have been part of the 2000-2020 Health and Retirement Study and the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey, both from the University of Michigan.

While experts generally recommend nonretirees have three to six months of living expenses set aside as emergency savings in case of job loss or other financial shocks, that amount may look different for retirees — who must figure out how to stretch their savings across what may be a decades-long retirement.

As many retirees struggle to keep up with prices that continue to rise, considering unexpected expenses is an important part of evaluating retirement readiness.

""That helps you plan for liquidity versus your income needs,"" said Anqi Chen, co-author of the report and associate director of savings and household finance at the Center for Retirement Research.

While some households may struggle to set aside money, ""even small amounts of savings will help provide some sort of buffer for when these events occur,"" Chen said.

Expenses are separated into three categories in the research: 

The Center for Retirement Research estimated that 60% of all retiree households will face a rainy day shock; 29% will have an unexpected family-related expense; and 58% will confront an unexpected health-care expense.

Higher-income retirees experience these unexpected expenses at a greater rate than those with lower incomes, according to the research. For example, about 45% of households with less than $50,000 in income face a rainy day or health-care shock in a given year, compared with 80% of those with $100,000 or more in income.

""This finding highlights the fact that households have some control over when and how much they spend,"" the report notes.

So how much should you have set aside? Depending on a retiree's individual situation, financial advisors may recommend anywhere from three or six months' worth of expenses to a couple of years — or a variation of those parameters. Much of it will depend on your individual situation.

""What we usually tell clients is to think less in terms of months of expenses and more in terms of access to cash for surprises — health-care costs, home repairs or family needs,"" said certified financial planner Joon Um, a tax advisor with Secure Tax & Accounting in Beverly Hills, California.

""For many retirees, that ends up being one year of core expenses, adjusted for guaranteed income like Social Security or pensions,"" Um said.

The right amount depends on health, housing, income stability and how flexible other assets are, Um said.

""Retirees with steady income and liquid portfolios may need less cash, while those with higher medical risk or less flexibility need more,"" Um said. ""The goal isn't to maximize cash. It's to have enough on hand to avoid selling long-term investments at the wrong time.""

In other words, if you don't have enough cash set aside, you could be put in a position of selling investments when the market is down.

However, having too much in cash comes with its own risks, said Peter Lazaroff, a chartered financial analyst and CFP, and the chief investment officer at Plancorp in St. Louis.

""Any time a retiree has more than two years of expenses in cash, it's too much,"" Lazaroff said. ""From purely a mathematical standpoint, you're giving up too much of a return.""

The biggest risk to your cash is inflation, he said. The latest reading of the consumer price index showed an annual inflation rate of 2.7% in December. 

""Your cash just becomes less valuable every year,"" he said. ""You're putting your purchasing power at risk.""

He recommends stashing your cash in a high-yield savings account — which right now generally earns more than 3% in interest, according to Bankrate — to help minimize the impact of inflation.

The founders of some of the world's most successful startups have been young: Think Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, both of whom were just 19 when they launched their ventures.

But with the rise of billion-dollar artificial intelligence (AI) startups comes a new trend: their founders, on average, appear to be getting younger.

A new report released by global early-stage venture capital firm Antler, found that the age of founders of AI unicorns has fallen from a peak age of 40 in 2021 to 29-years-old in 2024. Antler analyzed 1,629 unicorns and 3,512 founders globally for this report. 

However, in other industries, founder age is actually rising. In 2014, the average unicorn founder was 30 at the time of launch, compared with 34 for those who reached unicorn status between 2022 and 2024.

Several AI startups with young founders have been in the spotlight in the past year. Alexandr Wang, co-founder of $29 billion AI data labelling company Scale AI, is only 29-years-old. Wang was poached by Meta in June, in a $14.3 billion deal with the startup, to head up the tech giant's new AI research unit called TBD Labs.

In fact, Meta's former generative AI team, which was headed up by 65-year-old AI godfather Yann LeCun, was reorganized after its LLama4 AI model didn't perform well. 

This saw Wang become LeCun's manager and signaled Zuckerberg's desire to bring on a scrappier and more entrepreneurial AI lead, so that Meta could move faster in the AI space. 

Meanwhile, Mercor, an AI-powered talent and recruitment platform, was also co-founded by Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha, all of whom are currently age 22. It was recently valued at over $10 billion.

AnySphere, an AI-assisted coding and developer platform, valued at over $1 billion, is also headed up by 20-something-year-olds. 

Fridtjof Berge, co-founder and chief business officer at Antler, told CNBC Make It that the key qualities in founders have shifted to being able to ""move fast and break things,"" and ""continuously iterate and test and improve.""

Berge said: ""It's perhaps even more important now to experiment ... while other things which are still important but less important now is having been in an industry for a long time or learn the playbooks for how to traditionally think about scaling a new company."" 

Fridtjof explained that the expectations for industry experience in founders is now seen as less pivotal than being scrappy and entrepreneurial. 

""I think that as I've been reflecting on this ... the willingness and ability to experiment in the age of AI probably counts as more important than traditional corporate experience or corporate tenure,"" he said. 

Fridjtoff added that it ""matters less"" to have lots of experience in traditional company building and that it can, in fact, backfire. ""You might not think with a blank-slate state,"" he said. 

""I think that to be technically fluent with a lot of the really emerging latest and greatest technology, it sometimes helps to be young, because that's what you've learned recently in your training,"" he added. 

In fact, Antler's report found that AI startups are indeed scaling two years faster than all other industries, reaching unicorn status in an average of 4.7 years. Examples of rapidly scaling AI startups in 2025 were Mistral, Lovable, and Suno AI. 

And as Zuckerberg's own example proves, executing on a wild idea in a college dorm room can lead to phenomenal success.

""He was extremely young, and definitely has adapted, adjusted, and is now scaling one of the biggest companies in the world,"" Berge said. 

Venture Capital firm Leonis, released its Leonis AI 100 report in November, and also found that AI startup founders were a median age of 29 at founding. Most founders are in their mid-to late-20s, often coming straight from academia or research labs rather than corporate careers.

Berge noted that while 20-somethings have qualities that allow companies to move quickly, leadership can often change hands as the firm matures. 

""I guess it's nothing new that early or young founders start companies ... but it doesn't guarantee that all of the ones creating unicorns now will be the ones leading those companies in five to 10 years,"" He added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Elon Musk's xAI faces tougher road building out data centers after EPA rule update","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/16/musks-xai-faces-tougher-road-expanding-memphis-area-after-epa-update.html","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 01:20:00 GMT","



The Environmental Protection Agency closed a loophole this week that Elon Musk's xAI had exploited to rapidly stand up its first data center in Memphis, Tennessee. 

Musk's artificial intelligence startup created a kind of off-grid power plant for its Colossus facility by using a cluster of gas-burning turbines. The company was able to avoid air pollution permitting by classifying the turbines, which were mounted on trailers, as ""non-road engines.""

The EPA's updated rule clarifies that those kinds of turbines can't be designated as non-road engines and companies must also obtain Clean Air Act permits before installing them, particularly if their aggregate emissions will go above ""major source thresholds"" of pollution. 

The Shelby County Health Department in Memphis previously allowed xAI to designate its turbines as non-road engines, and to start using them without any public comment and environmental impact review, as would have been required in a standard permitting process. 

Representatives from the county's health department and xAI didn't respond to requests for comment. 

The move by the federal regulator could slow xAI's expansion in the Memphis area as it builds out facilities, packed with Nvidia's graphics processing units, to develop AI models and services in a booming generative AI market currently led by OpenAI and Google.

At the Memphis data center, which first opened in 2024, xAI conducts inference and training for its Grok models and apps, including a chatbot and image generator tightly integrated into the company's social network X.

While xAI had previously told Memphis regulators that its turbines would include state-of-the-art pollution controls, known as selective catalytic reduction technology, its supplier, Solaris Energy Infrastructure told CNBC in June that it did not install such controls in xAI's ""temporary"" turbines.

SEI, a Houston-based energy services provider, has seen its stock price soar in recent months, partly due to xAI's expansion plans. SEI didn't respond to a request for comment.

Pollution from the turbines has been a major source of local contention. 

Last year, residents in the majority-Black community of Boxtown in South Memphis testified at public hearings about a rotten egg-like stench in the air, and the impact of worsening smog on their heart and lung health. 

Research by scientists at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville also found that xAI's turbine use added to air pollution woes around Memphis.

Environmental advocates, including the NAACP, said they would sue to stop xAI's unpermitted use of the turbines. However, they didn't file a complaint after the county allowed xAI to treat the turbines as temporary, non-road engines, and issued them permits.

Amanda Garcia, an attorney with the Southern Environment Law Center, which is representing the NAACP, said in an email that her firm will monitor xAI operations to ensure they aren't violating terms of their permits, and are operating within the bounds of current EPA rules at forthcoming facilities in nearby Mississippi. 

XAI, which recently raised $20 billion from investors including Nvidia and Cisco, is currently being investigated in multiple jurisdictions after its Grok and X apps let users easily create and distribute deepfake violent and sexualized images of women and even children.

Monday - Friday, 6:00 - 7:00 PM ET

In this article

As Micron shares soared 7.76% on Friday, CNBC's Jim Cramer explained why he thinks some chip stocks still have room to run.

""Can these stocks keep going higher, though?"" Cramer asked. ""The answer is yes, in large part because we don't have enough equipment to expand production of these chips, and we can't put it together fast enough.""

Micron makes memory and storage technology for artificial intelligence. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told Cramer that his company is seeing huge demand for its products, and detailed its plans to spend $200 billion to build more domestic production capacity. On Friday, the company broke ground at its 600,000-foot facility in upstate New York.

″AI driven-demand is accelerating,"" Mehrotra told Cramer on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" Friday morning. ""It is real. It is here, and we need more and more memory to address that demand.""

Cramer noted that the fab's construction was made possible by the CHIPS act — a Biden era initiative that provided huge subsidies for domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The plant won't address the chip shortage immediately, he suggested, as it could take years to build. Unless demand becomes weaker, Cramer said he predicts prices for these products will keep going higher.

Along with Micron, Cramer named a number of similar stocks that have already seen huge gains this year, including Western Digital, Seagate and Sandisk.

Cramer suggested the shortage of certain semiconductors for the data center wasn't easy to predict, saying a year ago it seemed there was a glut in the technology. He indicated that Nvidia was the primary semiconductor name to foresee such high demand.

""Only Nvidia really saw it coming. They teamed up with the best of the best, Taiwan Semiconductor, to make all the high-end chips that are needed,"" Cramer said. ""There's no bottleneck there. There's no shortage, at least not in comparison to memory.""

Artificial intelligence is no longer a narrow technology trade. It is reshaping energy markets, infrastructure spending, and portfolio construction. Investors who focus only on chips and software risk missing where the next phase of value is occurring, according to investing experts on this week's episode of CNBC's ""ETF Edge.""

Some of the trends and innovations driving the market, and the rapid scaling of companies, are tied to AI's physical requirements. Power, cooling, grid stability, and data center efficiency have become binding constraints. Just look at the stock price of Bloom Energy, which for years after its 2018 IPO struggled to eke out a return above its IPO price. Since last year, when its onsite fuel cells began being ordered furiously for data centers, Bloom has seen its shares shoot up over 500% and the company reached a market cap above $30 billion. 

Many opportunities are being created in small- and mid-cap companies for investors. Firms that once sat outside the market's focus are now ""very quickly moving up the cap table,"" TCW Group global head of distribution Jennifer Grancio said on ""ETF Edge"" on Monday. In many cases, these companies operate in narrow segments with limited competition, allowing fundamentals to improve faster than investor awareness. 

Energy reliability is the central issue. In recent years, as the cost of renewable energy sources came down and became competitive with fossil fuel sources, the market debated ""How much regularity could we get out of wind, or could we get out of solar?"" Grancio said. But AI has shifted the conversation since data centers cannot tolerate intermittency, requiring a constant supply of power to avoid unintended downtime.

That reality has driven ""a huge shift towards nuclear,"" according to Grancio, including renewed investment in servicing existing plants and developing small modular reactors. These projects are spawning new suppliers and accelerating growth for specialized players that sit upstream of utilities and hyperscalers.

Efficiency inside the data center is equally critical. As AI workloads expand, cooling and power management have become the chokepoints. Investors are increasingly drawn to companies that are ""one or two in their field"" and ""the best at a certain technology"" particularly where alternatives are limited, Grancio said.

The structure of these markets matters. In some cases, there are ""only a few providers"" bordering on oligopolies, Grancio said. That concentration creates operating leverage, but it also means missteps can be costly.

Actively managed ETFs are gaining traction as a result. While passive indices can capture broad market returns and the indexes do add new companies as components as they scale, active strategies aim to identify them earlier and hold them through multiple phases of growth.

But the risks can be significant. Some parts of the AI-powered ecosystems include ""small, financially weak companies"" that are leveraged to electricity demand, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck. ""That also means you get a lot of volatility along the way,"" he said on ""ETF Edge.""

As a result, he said no single AI theme should dominate an investor's asset allocation. ""You don't want to overweight them in your portfolio,"" Van Eck said.

He described Van Eck's nuclear ETF as having traded at ""nosebleed levels"" last year before it came down to a more reasonable entry point for new investors.

The ETF experts said that as investors bring the AI theme into their portfolio construction in a more targeted way in 2026, active rebalancing and clear risk expectations will allow investors to stay invested without chasing peaks or panicking at drawdowns.

In this article

(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)

Warren Buffett and Becky Quick covered too many topics in the interviews that aired in a two-hour special on CNBC Tuesday evening for me to write a cogent summary.

""Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy"" included discussions about his inability to find a big company to purchase for Berkshire Hathaway as its cash pile moves toward $400 billion, new CEO Greg Abel, his company's future and past, the difficulty of giving away billions of dollars, and the invaluable role of luck in his success. That's not a comprehensive list.

Here, however, are some brief clips and quotes that caught my attention.  

""Being a director. I mean, it's the best job in the world. You get 250, 300, even up to 500 thousand dollars a year for doing something that's quite pleasant. Usually they give you the transportation, and they have cars waiting to take you around everything. And everybody's polite. And everybody'd love that job. I mean, who wouldn't?""

""Everything I wanted to have happen has worked out... Doesn't mean that everything we've done has worked out. But I couldn't imagine more fun than I've had running Berkshire. And Charlie and I would have more fun out of the things that didn't work a lot of times than (if they) did.""

""You should be wiser in the second half of your life than the first half. And if you've -- if things have worked well for you, you should be a better person in the second half of your life.""

Even though the special was two hours long, there was more interview than time, forcing the producer to make some difficult decisions.

Here for Warren Buffett Watch readers is a clip that she wanted to get into the final cut. Buffett explains why he hasn't been speaking out on politics in recent years:

BECKY QUICK:  You haven't commented as much publicly lately, either. You basically save it for the annual meeting when all the shareholders come into town.

WARREN BUFFETT:  Right.

BECKY QUICK:  Why is that?

WARREN BUFFETT:  Well, for one thing, I made the statement a few years ago — maybe, I don't know, five or six years ago — somebody asked about taking a political stance. And I said that you don't put your citizenship in a blind trust. But —

BECKY QUICK:  As a CEO.

WARREN BUFFETT:  And — as a CEO, yeah.

You have three or four hundred thousand employees, and you have millions of shareholders, but nevertheless you were entitled — I took the position — to speak out.

But I think — I've revisited that opinion in my mind, because people will have — gotten so tribal. We saw it on our gifts program at one time.

But there's no reason why somebody that's answering a phone at GEICO or waiting on a customer at the Nebraska Furniture Mart should be dealing with people who have a negative opinion of the company because of something I've said.

And, you know, here I am — if I want to speak as a private citizen, I should resign from Berkshire.

But I don't really want — I've got identified so much with Berkshire that I — as long as I'm speaking at the annual meeting or anything like that, people will associate it with the voice of Berkshire to some extent.

And the employees don't deserve that. The companies don't deserve it. And so I backed away from that.

Buffett has given his three adult children the extremely difficult talk of unanimously deciding how to give away his enormous net worth after he dies.

When she was in Omaha to interview their father, Becky sat down with Howard, Susan, and Peter Buffett to talk about that assignment, their own philanthropic efforts, and what it was like growing up in Buffett's famously unassuming house.

An extensive portion aired in the special, but this is the entire conversation:

In this excerpt, they remember how their father got ""clever"" about giving them an allowance:

HOWARD BUFFETT: You know, we'd earn this allowance for cleaning out gutters and cutting the lawn and raking leaves and stuff. But he — but Warren got pretty clever and he started giving it to us in quarters. And then he bought a slot —

SUSAN BUFFETT: Dimes!

HOWARD BUFFETT: Yeah.

SUSAN BUFFETT: It was a dime slot machine.

HOWARD BUFFETT: Yeah. And then he bought —

SUSAN BUFFETT: He got it all back.

HOWARD BUFFETT: And then he bought the slot machine, so he would get most of his allowance back. At least with me, he got a lot of it back.

In his Inside Wealth report on Wednesday's ""Squawk Box,"" Robert Frank explained why Buffett's children may have the most difficult job in philanthropy:

""Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy"" will be shown again on CNBC this coming Sunday, January 18 at 3 PM ET and Monday, January 19 at 7 AM ET.

The program is also available on demand for CNBC Pro and CNBC+ subscribers.

Warren Buffett is used to giving advice. 

For decades, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman has sat before a packed arena during his company's annual shareholder meetings, fielding investor questions on everything from artificial intelligence to the ins and outs of the insurance business to marriage advice. 

In ""Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy,"" which airs on Jan. 18 at 3 p.m. E.T. on CNBC, Becky Quick asks the Oracle of Omaha about some of the toughest questions and best advice he's ever given. Buffett eventually arrives at a challenge he used to pose to college students. 

Buffett would ask the students to consider a scenario in which, given a class of 300 or so of their peers, they could receive 10% of the lifetime earnings of five of them. Who would they choose — and why? And who would they sell short? The people you chose, he says, wouldn't necessarily be the best looking or the smartest or the most athletic. 

""Of course, I explained at the end, you can be the person that you would buy,"" Buffett says. ""There is nothing impossible. Because it isn't whether you can throw a football 60 yards, and it … isn't the one with the highest IQ. You can be one of the five."" 

So what could get you on the list of someone with high expected lifetime earnings? 

""It's luck, a lot of it. If you choose the right parents, you're rich when you come out,"" Buffett says. ""You've won the lottery — the ovarian lottery.""

But Buffett told students they could still be one of the people in the room their classmates should bet on. 

""You can do it by being a good person, by reading a lot, by spending less than you take in,"" he says. ""I just told them you can spend 110% of what you earn once, and then you used it up. The rest of your life you're underwater.""

Buffett makes sure to emphasize the latter point. While certain types of loans, such as a mortgage, may make sense in some instances, you generally want to avoid going into debt, Buffett says. 

""Beyond a certain point, if you get in a hole or anything, it is difficult to dig out,"" he says. ""It isn't that it's impossible, and I give credit to people to do it. But do it the easy way.""

Of course, you're not going to end up being one of the top earners among your peers if you don't work hard and focus on self-improvement, Buffett says. He recalls longtime partner Charlie Munger's habit of ""selling himself"" his most productive hour of the day — spending one hour each morning focusing exclusively on improving his mind and selling the rest of his working ours to clients.

""That's not crazy,"" Buffett says. ""Your future is your future, and you can't expect anybody else to do it.""

A longtime crypto bull is ditching bitcoin for gold.

Christopher Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, said he just cut bitcoin out of his firm's long-term model portfolio, where the token has accounted for around 5%-10% of the portfolio's allocation for the last five years.

That's because the price of the crypto has likely peaked, but also because there's an existential threat he sees jeopardizing the bitcoin ecosystem: quantum computing.

In a recent note to clients, Wood pointed specifically to CRQCs, or cryptographically relevant quantum computers — supercomputers that could potentially ""steal"" bitcoin from circulation, he said.

Bitcoin transactions are secured with cryptography, a coding system where transactions are encrypted with public keys, and access to the bitcoin itself is controlled by a private key. It would take supercomputers today ""trillions of years"" to derive a private key from a public one, given how complex the computations are, Wood said. But CRQCs could potentially reduce that time to something like several hours to several days, he speculated.

CRQCs don't yet exist, but chatter about the potential risks is already spreading across the bitcoin community, Wood said, pointing to a report from ChainCode Labs that estimated as much as 10 million tokens, or 50% of all bitcoin in circulation, could be accessed by a CRQC.

Some in the crypto community are arguing that the risk from CRQCs means ""vulnerable coins"" in the bitcoin ecosystem should be burned, Wood bited.

""While GREED & fear does not believe that the quantum issue is about to hit the Bitcoin price dramatically in the near term, the store of value concept is clearly on less solid foundation from the standpoint of a long-term pension portfolio,"" Wood said of his recent portfolio change. He added that he believed bitcoin reached its peak in the post-halving cycle at $126,000 last year.

Wood's team has replaced the allocation to bitcoin in the model portfolio with a 10% allocation to gold and gold mining stocks. The portfolio now has a total 45% allocation to physical gold, a 25% allocation to gold mining stocks, and a 30% allocation to Asian equities, excluding Japan.

""Meanwhile, the existential issue raised by quantum as regards Bitcoin can only be long-term positive for gold since it remains the historically stress tested store of value. Meanwhile, gold is also the best hedge, if not the only one, on the ever-rising geopolitical risks,"" Wood said.

It's been a rough few months for bitcoin, with the crypto tumbling into a bear market in late 2025 amid a broader risk-off move that was exacerbated by weak liquidity and concerns about the yen-carry trade.

Meanwhile, the case for owning gold has only grown stronger since its stunning rally in 2025. The metal saw its best performance since 1979 and continues to hover near a record high as investors seek protection from geopolitical conflict and inflationary pressures.

Something went wrong

The market shows renewed appetite for risk, as Bitcoin (BTCUSD) climbed above $95,000 and reached $97,000 this week. After a period of underperformance, cryptocurrencies are once again on the rise. This rally has coincided with cooling U.S. inflation signals, stable employment figures, and strong inflows into crypto ETFs.

Bitcoin treasury and analytics company MicroStrategy, now operating as Strategy (MSTR), is pouring money into the cryptocurrency, showing robust optimism in digital assets. In fact, MSTR CEO Michael Saylor expects Bitcoin prices to reach $1 million by 2029.

At this juncture, should you buy, sell, or hold MSTR stock?

Headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia, Strategy is the world's first and largest Bitcoin treasury company. Originally focused on enterprise analytics software since its 1989 founding, the company strategically pivoted to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, building substantial holdings.

This shift positions Strategy to offer investors exposure to Bitcoin through a range of securities while advancing analytics innovation. The company has a market capitalization of $49.1 billion.

As Bitcoin was going through a tough period, Strategy's stock also felt its impact. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has declined 52.67%, and over the past six months, 61.9%. Just for comparison, the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has increased by 16.89% and 10.8% over the same periods, respectively.

It had reached a 52-week high of $457.22 in July 2025, but is down 62% from that level. However, as Bitcoin has resurged following the “crypto winter,” the stock has gained 10.4% over the past five days. It is up by 16% from its 52-week low of $149.75 reached on Jan. 2, 2026.

MSTR's stock is trading at a discount to its peers. Its price-to-earnings ratio of 6.25x is considerably lower than the industry average of 32.73x.

On Oct. 30, Strategy reported its third-quarter results for fiscal 2025. The company's total revenue increased 10.9% year-over-year (YOY) to $128.69 million, exceeding Wall Street analysts' estimate of $117.10 million. This was based on Strategy's total product licenses and subscription services revenue, which grew 62.9% annually to $63.35 million.

Strategy's income from operations surged, turning a $432.58 million loss in Q3 2024 into a $3.89 billion profit in Q3 2025, which included an unrealized gain on the company's digital assets of $3.90 billion. Its bottom line shifted from a $1.72 loss per share to an $8.42 EPS.

Following its results, the company announced it had established a U.S. dollar reserve of $1.44 billion. The reserve would be used to pay the dividends of its preferred stock and interest on its outstanding indebtedness. It was funded by the proceeds of a sale of Class A common stock.

Wall Street analysts have a tepid view about Strategy's bottom line trajectory. For the fourth quarter, its loss per share is expected to increase significantly YOY to $18.06. For fiscal 2025, its loss per share is also expected to grow considerably YOY to $30.86. However, loss per share for fiscal 2026 is projected to decrease by 32.4% annually to $20.87.

Last month, Citi analyst Peter Christiansen reiterated a “Buy” rating on the stock but lowered the price target from $485 to $325. The analyst noted that the price target was reduced due to the firm's updated outlook on digital asset valuation. However, Christiansen expects legislative reforms to serve as a catalyst for the stock's growth heading into 2026.

In the same month, analysts at Bernstein lowered the firm's price target from $600 to $450, while maintaining an “Outperform” rating on the stock. Yet, analysts maintained that concerns about Strategy's financial stability were overstated. Bernstein experts believe that the company is rapidly transforming into a Bitcoin-reserved financial operating business that can offer fixed-income yields and savings products to investors.

Cantor Fitzgerald analysts lowered the stock's price target from $560 to $229 but maintained a bullish “Overweight” rating. Analysts cited a recalculation of the company's Bitcoin holdings as the reason for this reduction, but they maintain a long-term bullish view on Bitcoin and remain optimistic about MSTR.

In November, analysts at Monness, Crespi, Hardt upgraded the stock from “Sell” to “Neutral.” The analysts cited a lower premium relative to MSTR's Bitcoin holdings and reduced downside risk.

MSTR has become a popular stock on Wall Street, with analysts awarding it a consensus “Strong Buy” rating. Of the 16 analysts rating the stock, a majority of 13 analysts have rated it a “Strong Buy,” one analyst suggests a “Moderate Buy,” while two analysts are playing it safe with a “Hold” rating. The consensus price target of $473.79 represents a 172.8% upside from current levels. The Street-high price target of $705 indicates a 305.9% upside. 

The fate of Strategy largely depends on the volatility of Bitcoin, a volatile asset. The stock faces downside risk, especially if crypto enters a prolonged downturn. However, analysts remain bullish on the stock, expecting significant upside. Therefore, investors may wish to consider it in hopes of significant gains.

Newrez, a leading mortgage lender and servicer, announced plans to begin recognizing cryptocurrency assets for mortgage qualification in February 2026.

This marks a significant integration of digital finance into the traditional housing market.

The initiative will allow borrowers to use holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD-pegged stablecoins, and spot crypto exchange-traded funds to verify assets. Those holdings may also be used to estimate income for mortgage loan applications.

The program is exclusive to Newrez's Smart Series product suite. The line offers non-qualified mortgage loans for borrowers who fall outside standard government-backed lending guidelines.

Newrez President Baron Silverstein said the move reflects a necessary evolution in modern lending as the crypto industry becomes increasingly integrated with traditional finance.

The lender cited internal data showing that about 45% of Gen Z and Millennial investors own cryptocurrency. It described the group as a core demographic of first-time homebuyers.

Notably, lenders historically required these borrowers to liquidate their digital holdings to prove reserves, triggering taxable events and forcing them out of the market.

“We believe that now is the right time to prudently integrate eligible crypto assets into modern mortgage lending—enabling consumers to preserve investments while accessing innovative financing solutions,” Silverstein explained.

Under the new policy, borrowers can qualify without selling their assets. However, the lenders will apply market-adjusted valuations to account for crypto price volatility.

“Our mission at Newrez is to do everything possible to make home happen and this innovation marks yet another step in creating new pathways to homeownership, giving consumers flexibility and control,” Leslie Gillin, Newrez Chief Commercial Officer, said.

Moreover, the program also imposes strict guardrails for these new borrowers. Newrez confirmed that borrowers can use crypto for underwriting ratios but must still pay down payments and closing costs in US dollars.

Additionally, all eligible assets must be held by US-regulated entities, such as compliant exchanges, retail FinTech apps, or SEC- or FINRA-regulated brokerages.

This requirement effectively excludes assets held in self-custody wallets or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

Meanwhile, the announcement follows a broader regulatory shift in Washington. 

In June 2025, the Federal Housing Finance Agency issued a directive to consider cryptocurrency in mortgage risk modeling. The agency asked Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop proposals for incorporating digital assets into single-family loan risk assessments.

That directive is part of the Trump administration's wider overhaul of US financial policy. It signaled a thawing of relations between federal housing regulators and the crypto industry.

Ethereum is slowly grinding higher after December's recovery, but it's now pressing into a heavy multi-month resistance cluster around $3.3–$3.5K.

The price structure is constructive, and on-chain activity via active addresses is breaking higher, which is a positive backdrop. Yet, ETH is doing all of this right under resistance, so the next few days should decide whether we get a clean breakout or another rejection back into the range.

On the daily chart, ETH has bounced cleanly from the green demand zone around $2.7K mark and pushed back into the key supply area at $3.3–$3.5K. This zone lines up with the 100-day moving average, while the 200-day moving average is sitting higher as the next dynamic resistance.

As long as the price holds above the $3K area, the structure remains a series of higher lows pointing to accumulation rather than distribution. A decisive daily close above the $3.5K mark would also open the door toward the psychological $4K level, while losing the $3K zone would likely send ETH back toward the $2.7K support block.



On the 4H, ETH has been trading within a symmetrical triangle, formed by higher lows and lower highs. However, it has recently broken the pattern to the upside, and is now testing the blue resistance band around $3.3–$3.4K. The last push into that zone came with an overbought RSI signal, which explains the current sideways/pullback behavior.

In the short-term, the local support around the $3K zone and the rising trendline just below, near the $2.9K level, should be watched. As long as those hold, buyers can still stage another breakout attempt above $3.4K. On the other hand, a clean break below the lower trendline would shift momentum back to sellers and put the $2.5K zone back on the table as downside targets.



The 30-day moving average of Ethereum active addresses has been trending up since the beginning of this year and has now pushed above the highs of the past year, while the price is still below its prior peaks.

This massive surge in active addresses usually points to improving organic usage and network demand, which often supports uptrends after periods of consolidation. At the same time, spikes in activity right under resistance have occasionally coincided with local tops when price fails to follow through.

So if active addresses stay elevated or keep rising while ETH finally clears $3.5K, it would strongly support a new leg higher; if activity rolls over while price keeps stalling here, it would argue for a deeper cool-off back into the lower support zones.

Bitcoin (BTC) is not legal tender, and that is precisely the key reason it has become one of the world's unique and high-value assets. Its core characteristics lie in the fact that governments cannot dilute holders' equity by issuing more currency, while also demonstrating strong resistance to various bans and shutdown attempts.

Recent dynamics in U.S. politics have provided a new direction for Bitcoin's value as a holding. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell publicly stated that his interest rate decisions face litigation threats from the executive branch, with related congressional subpoenas being seen as political tools attempting to influence interest rates. Such a direct challenge to central bank independence is rare in U.S. history. The independence of central banks is intended to ensure that financial experts can formulate policies based on the nation's long-term interests rather than succumbing to short-term political considerations.

This move could lead to more politically driven actions in the future, directly affecting the federal funds rate and, in turn, impacting the value of the U.S. dollar and assets denominated in it. Faced with such uncertainty, it is a natural choice for investors to seek assets that can avoid excessive government intervention, and Bitcoin stands out for its allocation value in this context. The Federal Reserve has no jurisdiction over Bitcoin, which forms an important basis for its current appeal.

It is crucial to recognize clearly that investing in Bitcoin does not eliminate all risks. The cryptocurrency sector is also not entirely free from political influence and may face potential pressures such as higher taxes, trading restrictions, stringent information disclosure requirements, or custody constraints—any of which could affect its price, although the likelihood of a single intervention causing its price to collapse is low.

Moreover, due to its high volatility, Bitcoin cannot replace the function of cash. Its price may experience significant pullbacks in underperforming years, and using it for daily payments remains highly inconvenient. Therefore, any investment in Bitcoin should be approached cautiously, with funds allocated being limited to what one can afford to lose, avoiding excessive allocation. A prudent approach is to view it as an asset class for hedging against potential monetary policy errors, which in the current environment seems to be an option worth considering for increasing holdings.

Blockchain-related companies are also seeking new growth pathways. Taking Cipher Mining (CIFR) as an example, the company is strategically transitioning from purely Bitcoin mining operations to the high-performance computing (HPC) sector. Although its revenue of $164.2 million in the first three quarters of 2025 still comes entirely from mining, its HPC layout has demonstrated significant potential through substantial contracts.

The company recently secured several major agreements with large technology firms. In September 2025, Cipher signed an initial 10-year HPC hosting contract with the artificial intelligence cloud platform Fluidstack, valued at approximately $30 billion, with renewal options that could bring the total potential value to around $70 billion. In November of the same year, it also entered into a 15-year leasing agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS) worth approximately $5.5 billion to provide infrastructure support for AI workloads.

These agreements are expected to start contributing revenue from the second half of 2026, each potentially generating hundreds of millions of dollars in annual income. Although its stock price has risen by 255% over the past year, and its price-to-sales ratio of approximately 32 times appears high, given the sustained growth in demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure and the revenue prospects brought by these new contracts, this transforming blockchain stock is believed to have significant growth potential.

Key Takeaways

Linea is designed to help Ethereum handle more users and transactions without high fees.

Linea works just like Ethereum, so apps built for Ethereum can run on Linea without changes.

Transactions on Linea cost less, confirm faster, and are still protected by Ethereum's robust security. 

Linea is built to be easy to use, safe, and fully connected to Ethereum, instead of using risky or experimental ideas. 

“What is Linea?” is a question many Ethereum users are asking as the network continues to grow. Linea is an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain developed by Consensys. It helps transactions run faster and cost less, while still relying on Ethereum for security. Linea is built on top of Ethereum, so existing contracts and tools can still be used without any changes.

In this guide, we explain how Linea works, its key features, ecosystem, token, and airdrop status. We will also explore its long-term role in the evolving Ethereum Layer-2 landscape. Read on to clearly understand where it fits and why it matters.



Linea is a Layer-2 (L2) blockchain solution built on Ethereum to improve speed, lower fees, and reduce congestion. It helps Ethereum handle more activity without slowing down or becoming expensive for users. While Ethereum processes transactions directly on its main network, Linea handles most transactions outside Ethereum and then sends a small confirmation back to Ethereum.

Launched by ConSensys, the network focuses on solving common Ethereum problems, such as high gas fees and slow confirmation times. This makes everyday actions like swapping tokens, minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and using DeFi apps much more affordable without compromising Ethereum's security.

Linea is built for users and developers who want an Ethereum-like experience but with faster and cheaper transactions. Because Linea is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalent, it works the same way as Ethereum, developers can move their apps without changing the code.

Linea works by handling transactions outside Ethereum while still using the mainnet for final security. You can think of Linea as a faster lane that still leads back to Ethereum. Here's how it works:

Zk-Rollups are a method for processing multiple transactions off the Ethereum blockchain. Linea uses the zero-knowledge technology to make transactions cheaper and faster. Instead of recording every transaction on Ethereum, zk-Rollups handle most of the work elsewhere and then send a short proof to Ethereum. Because Ethereum only needs to verify the proof, not every transaction, costs stay low, and the network avoids congestion. 

Benefits include:

Compared to Optimistic Rollups, zk-Rollups provide faster finality without long waiting periods, making them better for frequent transactions. 

Linea is fully EVM-equivalent, meaning it behaves exactly like Ethereum at the technical level. If a smart contract works on Ethereum, it will work the same way on Linea. This allows developers to:

In return, this reduces risk and makes Linea easy to adopt for Ethereum developers.

One of the main reasons users choose Linea is its low-cost transactions. Ethereum fees can become expensive during busy periods, sometimes costing $5 to $50 per transaction. Most Linea transactions cost only a fraction of a cent. With low fees, everyday actions like swaps, NFT minting, and in-app transactions become affordable and practical, even for smaller amounts.

Linea can handle thousands of transactions per second. Instead of processing actions one by one like Ethereum, it can process many transactions altogether, which keeps the network fast even when usage increases. As more people use Linea, the network can grow to support that demand without slowing down. 

Linea gets its security from Ethereum. After transactions are processed on this blockchain, a confirmation is sent to Ethereum to ensure everything was done correctly. Once Ethereum approves it, the transaction becomes permanent. Linea relies on Ethereum, not a separate system, to keep user funds safe. Because all important information is saved on Ethereum, users can still access and recover their funds even if Linea were to stop working temporarily.

Linea stands out for speed, full EVM compatibility, and zk-Rollup security, combining the best of multiple L2 approaches.



Linea's ecosystem is growing with a strong focus on useful Ethereum-based applications, not experimental tools that are hard to use. 

Overall, Linea focuses on being easy to use, affordable, and closely aligned with Ethereum. This explains why more developers and everyday users are adopting it. 

Linea supports popular Ethereum wallets, including MetaMask. Ensure your wallet is updated to the latest version to avoid network or signing issues.

The network does not appear by default in most wallets. You can add it manually by entering Linea's network details or automatically through trusted network listing tools. Once added, switch your wallet between the Ethereum mainnet and Linea.

First, buy Ethereum from an exchange of your choice, then bridge it to Linea using an official bridge or a trusted bridge. If you're unfamiliar with the process, follow this step-by-step guide to buying Ethereum. Start with a small amount to test the process, as bridging introduces smart contract risk. 

Transactions use ETH for gas, just like Ethereum. Make sure you bridge enough ETH to cover transaction fees. Fees are significantly lower, but an insufficient amount of ETH will prevent transactions from executing.

Use DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and other applications built on Linea decentralized applications (dApps). Transactions settle faster, making activities like swaps, staking, and minting more efficient.

Track transactions using a compatible block explorer. This helps verify confirmations, gas usage, and contract interactions, especially when using new protocols.



The LINEA token was officially launched through a token generation event in September 2025, with a fixed total supply of 72 billion tokens. As part of its initial distribution, 10% of the total token supply was allocated to an airdrop targeting early and active users of its blockchain. 

To qualify, users had to interact with the network. This included bridging assets, using dApps, and completing programs such as Linea Voyage and Linea Park. The claim window for the airdrop remained open for 90 days, ending on December 9, 2025.

During this period, eligible users could check their Linea crypto allocation and claim LINEA tokens directly to their wallets through official Linea channels. Any tokens that went unclaimed after the deadline went to the ecosystem fund. This helps support future growth and incentives.

Now, the LINEA token focuses on long-term growth. It is designed to support the network as Linea continues to expand. All transaction fees on Linea are paid using ETH. This means every time people use the network, ETH is involved. 

A portion of the value generated by Linea is then permanently removed from circulation through a built-in Linea burn system. More activity on Linea leads to fewer ETH and LINEA tokens in circulation. Over time, this strengthens Linea as a long-term layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum.

The future of Linea is closely tied to Ethereum's long-term scaling plans. As Ethereum grows, it helps handle more users and transactions without becoming slow or expensive. 

By Q1 2026, Linea plans to reach Type-1 zkEVM equivalence. Apps will run without changes, making it easier for developers to build and move projects. This keeps Linea closely aligned with Ethereum and supports its role as a long-term layer 2 scaling solution.

Linea also benefits from strong backing by Consensys. Consensys is a major contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem and the company behind MetaMask and Infura. This connection provides access to a large group of users and developers. It also makes adoption easier because Linea works smoothly with tools that are already in use.

From a technology point of view, Linea focuses on full EVM equivalence. Ethereum apps can move to Linea without changing their code. Developers can scale their apps safely. Financial apps, in particular, benefit from this reliability.  

That said, Layer-2 is highly competitive. Networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base already have more users and bigger ecosystems. Linea will need to attract top apps. It must also continue to improve speed, decentralization, and security to remain competitive and an ideal choice for users.

Linea offers a practical and scalable solution for Ethereum users and developers. It delivers lower fees, faster transactions, and reliable EVM compatibility. Its zero-knowledge rollup technology and strong backing from Consensys position it as a solid Layer-2 network within the Ethereum ecosystem. While adoption is still growing, Linea offers a secure and accessible way to utilize decentralized applications, bridge assets, and participate in a token-driven 

The primary purpose of the Linea network is to help scale Ethereum. Linea improves transaction speed, reduces fees, and reduces congestion on the Ethereum mainnet. It also allows developers to use Ethereum smart contracts and lets users interact with dApps more easily.

Yes. Linea is a good investment. It may interest users who follow Ethereum scaling projects, but like all crypto assets, it carries risk.

Yes. You can move ETH and other assets from the Ethereum mainnet to Linea using official bridges. This allows you to pay lower fees and receive faster transaction confirmations while still using Ethereum apps.

Linea is used for running smart contracts, utilizing DeFi platforms, trading tokens, and interacting with NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. Its low-cost, fast transactions make it useful for both developers and daily users.

Key Takeaways

Ethereum gaming NFTs now function as core gameplay infrastructure, with ownership directly influencing progression, strategy, and long-term player engagement rather than serving as speculative collectibles.

Layer 2 networks such as Immutable X, Polygon, and Arbitrum Nova have become foundational to blockchain gaming by enabling low-cost, high-frequency interactions that support real-time gameplay and user retention.

High volatility and frequent rank changes among GameFi tokens stem from rapid experimentation, shifting utility models, and uneven liquidity across projects.

Long-term growth in Ethereum gaming NFTs depends on ecosystem design, security, and accessibility rather than hype-driven cycles or short-lived market narratives.

The Ethereum gaming NFT ecosystem has evolved from a speculative experiment into a structured digital economy where ownership, gameplay, and on-chain infrastructure increasingly intersect. Since NFTs' explosive hype a few years ago, the market has experienced significant ups and downs.

So rather than focusing on individual titles or short-term market performance, this analysis examines Ethereum's gaming NFT ecosystem at a systems level. We also assess key projects, emerging trends, and on-chain dynamics to provide a clearer understanding of where Ethereum-based gaming stands today and its positioning for future ecosystem growth.



The Ethereum gaming NFT ecosystem consists of blockchain-based games, digital assets, marketplaces, and supporting infrastructure built on the Ethereum network. Even amid a months-long downturn, the Ethereum game world is picking up and is currently estimated at $14.1 billion.

But how exactly do the components of the ecosystem work? Unlike traditional games, developers use non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent ownership, allowing players to own, trade, and transfer digital assets across multiple games. These NFTs represent characters, virtual land, items, cards, and other in-game assets.

Because the blockchain records them on-chain, players can independently verify ownership and authenticity without relying on centralized game servers or publishers. Ethereum enables developers to encode game rules, mechanics, asset scarcity, and economic rules directly into decentralized applications using smart contracts.

Players can trade gaming NFTs on external marketplaces, use them as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, or integrate them into secondary platforms. As a result, in-game assets gain real-world utility beyond gameplay and can participate in broader on-chain economic activity.

The Ethereum ecosystem is booming right now, and several Ethereum-based gaming NFT projects are leading the ecosystem. Here are the top Ethereum-based projects to watch out for:

Ethereum-powered NFT games use the blockchain to store player-owned assets such as characters, land, and items, enabling trading and play-to-earn gaming rewards. These titles run natively on the Ethereum blockchain network or its Layer 2 networks for scalability and low fees. Some of the best Ethereum NFT games topping the charts consistently include:



The Ethereum GameFi ecosystem is the broader financial and infrastructure layer supporting blockchain games on Ethereum. The GameFi ecosystem merges gaming with decentralized finance, enabling players to earn real value through NFTs, tokens, and yield-generating mechanics on the blockchain. 

This includes governance tokens, staking mechanisms, decentralized marketplaces, DAO-based game studios, and liquidity systems that connect game assets with decentralized finance. Instead of operating as isolated games, many projects function as interconnected economies where in-game assets have value beyond a single platform.

Players may stake Ethereum gaming tokens to access features, vote on game development proposals, or earn yields tied to in-game activity. Game developers benefit from Ethereum's mature tooling, security standards, and developer community, which lowers the barrier to building complex GameFi products. 



Ethereum NFT platforms/marketplaces serve as the primary trading hubs for in-game items, including characters, weapons, land parcels, and digital collectibles. These platforms allow users to buy, sell, and list NFTs using smart contracts, ensuring transparent ownership transfers and verifiable asset histories.

OpenSea leads as the dominant Ethereum NFT marketplace, supporting millions of listings across art, in-game items, and collectibles with multi-chain compatibility, including Polygon. Blur tops the charts for professional traders with advanced tools such as bulk buying and analytics, while LooksRare offers rewards for loyal users.

In addition to these big players, Magic Eden has gradually surged in popularity for its low fees and game environment, bridging Ethereum with other chains. As competition increases, marketplaces are evolving to support creator tools, gaming-focused curation, and improved user experience tailored specifically to blockchain games.

The blockchain gaming market, led by Ethereum, is projected to grow toward $818.5 billion by 2032 at 66.5% CAGR, fueled by non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Layer 2 adoption. Ethereum holds a strong share due to its secure NFT ecosystem, even though Polygon is surging for decentralization. In 2026, the focus is shifting to player governance via DAOs, AI customization, and real-world asset integration.

Gaming on Ethereum blockchain has shifted away from hype-driven speculation toward utility-focused assets that integrate directly into gameplay. As the broader blockchain gaming industry expands, NFT gaming continues to gain traction. Market projections estimate the sector will grow from $7.63 billion in 2026 to $45.88 billion by 2034.

This reflects a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.14%, driven largely by ecosystem security and infrastructure maturity. Early 2026 market data reinforces this momentum, with weekly NFT sales rising 30%+ to $85 million, signalling a market rebound. The uprising was a win for gamers and enthusiasts, given that the market had been experiencing a significant downturn for months.

With increased adoption, game developers are now prioritizing seamless mobile access and community-driven events to sustain engagement. This shift supports ecosystems where value emerges from real usage rather than short-term trends, allowing secondary markets to thrive on functional assets with long-term relevance.

Layer 2 upgrades on Ethereum further lower participation barriers. These networks reduce costs for casual gamers while enabling developers to blend entertainment with genuine digital ownership across metaverses and multiplayer environments.

Ethereum gaming NFTs currently show robust on-chain activity, with Ethereum leading NFT sales volume at 1 million daily, up 40% from prior periods. Layer-2 networks like Arbitrum Nova make these interactions smoother, allowing players to act almost effortlessly, similar to posting on social media. They also enable gasless transactions, boosting engagement in fully on-chain games.

Projects like Pirate Nation on Arbitrum Nova use collectible NFTs as playable characters, enabling real-time battles and social gameplay that drive consistent on-chain interactions. These metrics reinforce Ethereum's continued dominance in gaming NFTs. Meanwhile, sales activity shows sustained demand for blue-chip collections and established marketplaces.

Ethereum GameFi tokens exhibit high volatility and frequent rank shifts, highlighting how speculative yet dynamic the ecosystem is. Daily price swings are common among top performers, driven by game updates, market sentiment, and spikes in on-chain activity.



Tokens like Games for a Living (GFAL) show extreme 7-day changes down by 4.19%, while Star Atlas (POLIS) is also down by almost 10%, highlighting sensitivity to player metrics and token unlocks. Mid-tier coins such as MemeFi (MEMEFI) and TOPIA fluctuate 50-65% weekly, outpacing stable giants like IMX or AXS. Analysis shows that this volatility stems from low liquidity and hype cycles around NFT drops or partnerships.



Top 100 GameFi rankings on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap show a 20-30% monthly turnover. Risers like Mythos (MYTH) are benefiting from ecosystem expansions, while fallers like Pixels (PIXEL) are dropping amid diluted utility. Ethereum-based tokens dominate but shuffle as Layer 2 rivals like Xai (XAI) surged 7-14% earlier in the year amid gaming adoption. Fluidity correlates with trading volume, with high-activity projects climbing the ranks rapidly.

Generally, major tokens associated with established NFT games tend to maintain steady rankings with less significant downturns due to liquidity and broad usage. In contrast, smaller or newer tokens can experience abrupt fluctuations from new releases, updates, or community activity.

GameFi on Ethereum is set for steady growth in 2026 and beyond. It is evolving beyond early hype to create sustainable play-to-earn worlds where enjoyable gameplay naturally leads to real rewards. Layer-2 networks help this shift by reducing fees and speeding up transactions, enabling players to own and trade in-game NFTs seamlessly across multiple titles. 

As Ethereum's ecosystem grows with new users and stablecoins, game developers focus on approachable experiences that bring everyday gamers into Web3 without steep learning curves. Building on this foundation, smart features such as artificial intelligence (AI) personalization and move-to-earn challenges keep players engaged.

On the other hand, interoperability connects assets across games and metaverses, ensuring lasting value. Community events and clearer regulations attract serious investors, supporting projects with strong player bases rather than short-lived token hype.

In addition, Ethereum's increasing liquidity, particularly in mobile-heavy regions like Asia-Pacific, makes it easier for anyone to participate in thriving ecosystems. This combination positions GameFi for a projected 29.5% annual expansion through 2033, aiming for $11 billion by 2026, as smoother wallets and stable rewards enhance user confidence.

Below are ways you can get started in Ethereum's gaming NFT space, from setting up a wallet to participating in communities and building valuable in-game assets.

To overcome Ethereum's scalability constraints, many gaming projects deploy on Layer 2 networks such as Immutable X and Polygon. These solutions reduce transaction costs, enable faster interactions, and support gas-free NFT trading, improving the overall gameplay and trading experience.

Layer 2 networks like Polygon expand Ethereum's capabilities by processing thousands of transactions off-chain and settling them securely using zero-knowledge proofs. This drastically reduces costs and ensures seamless transactions, making blockchain-based gaming feel as smooth and instant. 

Beyond cost and speed, Layer 2 solutions enable interoperability across games and marketplaces. Assets can easily move between Layer 2 titles and Ethereum's mainnet, increasing their utility and enabling players to leverage items across multiple ecosystems.

Ethereum 2.0's transition to proof-of-stake improved scalability and allows more transactions at lower energy costs. Games can support larger communities, complex mechanics, and live events without network congestion. Aside from game speed, this transition encourages game developers to create intricate worlds where NFTs influence progression, abilities, and rewards in real time.

The upgrade also strengthens reliability, minimizing downtime for tournaments, metaverse sessions, or multiplayer campaigns. Players can trust that their digital assets are secure, while developers gain confidence to experiment with ambitious features such as AI-driven loot systems and procedural world-building.

Ethereum underpins metaverse and VR experiences by allowing interoperable NFTs that exist across multiple virtual worlds. Players can own digital land, characters, and items that retain value beyond a single title, creating persistent economies.

Assets can generate yield through rentals, events, or trade, turning gameplay into a layered experience where in-game participation directly influences financial outcomes. Meanwhile, Layer 2 networks ensure trades and interactions remain fast and frictionless, even with thousands of simultaneous users.

And as VR hardware becomes more affordable and AI-enhanced experiences proliferate, Ethereum integrates AR and VR to merge real and virtual worlds. Players can interact in hybrid spaces, host events, and compete in NFT-based challenges while enjoying lag-free transactions. This makes virtual ownership feel tangible and meaningful, rather than isolated to one platform.

The Ethereum gaming NFT ecosystem offers exciting opportunities, but it comes with risks that players and developers must understand.

The Ethereum gaming NFT ecosystem continues to evolve as developers move beyond early experimentation into more sustainable gaming models. With strong infrastructure, active developer communities, and expanding Layer 2 adoption, Ethereum remains central to the future of NFT gaming. While risks remain, Ethereum's role as the foundation for gaming NFTs is likely to persist well into 2026 and beyond.

Ethereum offers a secure, programmable foundation for NFTs, enabling true digital ownership that persists across games and marketplaces. Its large developer ecosystem, smart contract capabilities, and growing Layer 2 solutions make it ideal for scalable, interactive, and interoperable experiences across multiple games and marketplaces.

Yes, but earnings depend on the game you choose, your strategy, and market conditions. Players can earn through play-to-earn mechanics, trading NFTs, or participating in in-game economies, but success requires research, patience, and an understanding of risk.

Ethereum itself is secure, but individual games or NFT projects employ different security features. Some risks gaming projects on Ethereum carry include smart contract bugs, phishing attacks, and volatile markets. To reduce exposure to risks, use trusted and reputable platforms, secure your wallet with additional features, and verify each asset.

Key Takeaways

Linea is designed to help Ethereum handle more users and transactions without high fees.

Linea works just like Ethereum, so apps built for Ethereum can run on Linea without changes.

Transactions on Linea cost less, confirm faster, and are still protected by Ethereum's robust security. 

Linea is built to be easy to use, safe, and fully connected to Ethereum, instead of using risky or experimental ideas. 

“What is Linea?” is a question many Ethereum users are asking as the network continues to grow. Linea is an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain developed by Consensys. It helps transactions run faster and cost less, while still relying on Ethereum for security. Linea is built on top of Ethereum, so existing contracts and tools can still be used without any changes.

In this guide, we explain how Linea works, its key features, ecosystem, token, and airdrop status. We will also explore its long-term role in the evolving Ethereum Layer-2 landscape. Read on to clearly understand where it fits and why it matters.



Linea is a Layer-2 (L2) blockchain solution built on Ethereum to improve speed, lower fees, and reduce congestion. It helps Ethereum handle more activity without slowing down or becoming expensive for users. While Ethereum processes transactions directly on its main network, Linea handles most transactions outside Ethereum and then sends a small confirmation back to Ethereum.

Launched by ConSensys, the network focuses on solving common Ethereum problems, such as high gas fees and slow confirmation times. This makes everyday actions like swapping tokens, minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and using DeFi apps much more affordable without compromising Ethereum's security.

Linea is built for users and developers who want an Ethereum-like experience but with faster and cheaper transactions. Because Linea is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalent, it works the same way as Ethereum, developers can move their apps without changing the code.

Linea works by handling transactions outside Ethereum while still using the mainnet for final security. You can think of Linea as a faster lane that still leads back to Ethereum. Here's how it works:

Zk-Rollups are a method for processing multiple transactions off the Ethereum blockchain. Linea uses the zero-knowledge technology to make transactions cheaper and faster. Instead of recording every transaction on Ethereum, zk-Rollups handle most of the work elsewhere and then send a short proof to Ethereum. Because Ethereum only needs to verify the proof, not every transaction, costs stay low, and the network avoids congestion. 

Benefits include:

Compared to Optimistic Rollups, zk-Rollups provide faster finality without long waiting periods, making them better for frequent transactions. 

Linea is fully EVM-equivalent, meaning it behaves exactly like Ethereum at the technical level. If a smart contract works on Ethereum, it will work the same way on Linea. This allows developers to:

In return, this reduces risk and makes Linea easy to adopt for Ethereum developers.

One of the main reasons users choose Linea is its low-cost transactions. Ethereum fees can become expensive during busy periods, sometimes costing $5 to $50 per transaction. Most Linea transactions cost only a fraction of a cent. With low fees, everyday actions like swaps, NFT minting, and in-app transactions become affordable and practical, even for smaller amounts.

Linea can handle thousands of transactions per second. Instead of processing actions one by one like Ethereum, it can process many transactions altogether, which keeps the network fast even when usage increases. As more people use Linea, the network can grow to support that demand without slowing down. 

Linea gets its security from Ethereum. After transactions are processed on this blockchain, a confirmation is sent to Ethereum to ensure everything was done correctly. Once Ethereum approves it, the transaction becomes permanent. Linea relies on Ethereum, not a separate system, to keep user funds safe. Because all important information is saved on Ethereum, users can still access and recover their funds even if Linea were to stop working temporarily.

Linea stands out for speed, full EVM compatibility, and zk-Rollup security, combining the best of multiple L2 approaches.



Linea's ecosystem is growing with a strong focus on useful Ethereum-based applications, not experimental tools that are hard to use. 

Overall, Linea focuses on being easy to use, affordable, and closely aligned with Ethereum. This explains why more developers and everyday users are adopting it. 

Linea supports popular Ethereum wallets, including MetaMask. Ensure your wallet is updated to the latest version to avoid network or signing issues.

The network does not appear by default in most wallets. You can add it manually by entering Linea's network details or automatically through trusted network listing tools. Once added, switch your wallet between the Ethereum mainnet and Linea.

First, buy Ethereum from an exchange of your choice, then bridge it to Linea using an official bridge or a trusted bridge. If you're unfamiliar with the process, follow this step-by-step guide to buying Ethereum. Start with a small amount to test the process, as bridging introduces smart contract risk. 

Transactions use ETH for gas, just like Ethereum. Make sure you bridge enough ETH to cover transaction fees. Fees are significantly lower, but an insufficient amount of ETH will prevent transactions from executing.

Use DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and other applications built on Linea decentralized applications (dApps). Transactions settle faster, making activities like swaps, staking, and minting more efficient.

Track transactions using a compatible block explorer. This helps verify confirmations, gas usage, and contract interactions, especially when using new protocols.



The LINEA token was officially launched through a token generation event in September 2025, with a fixed total supply of 72 billion tokens. As part of its initial distribution, 10% of the total token supply was allocated to an airdrop targeting early and active users of its blockchain. 

To qualify, users had to interact with the network. This included bridging assets, using dApps, and completing programs such as Linea Voyage and Linea Park. The claim window for the airdrop remained open for 90 days, ending on December 9, 2025.

During this period, eligible users could check their Linea crypto allocation and claim LINEA tokens directly to their wallets through official Linea channels. Any tokens that went unclaimed after the deadline went to the ecosystem fund. This helps support future growth and incentives.

Now, the LINEA token focuses on long-term growth. It is designed to support the network as Linea continues to expand. All transaction fees on Linea are paid using ETH. This means every time people use the network, ETH is involved. 

A portion of the value generated by Linea is then permanently removed from circulation through a built-in Linea burn system. More activity on Linea leads to fewer ETH and LINEA tokens in circulation. Over time, this strengthens Linea as a long-term layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum.

The future of Linea is closely tied to Ethereum's long-term scaling plans. As Ethereum grows, it helps handle more users and transactions without becoming slow or expensive. 

By Q1 2026, Linea plans to reach Type-1 zkEVM equivalence. Apps will run without changes, making it easier for developers to build and move projects. This keeps Linea closely aligned with Ethereum and supports its role as a long-term layer 2 scaling solution.

Linea also benefits from strong backing by Consensys. Consensys is a major contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem and the company behind MetaMask and Infura. This connection provides access to a large group of users and developers. It also makes adoption easier because Linea works smoothly with tools that are already in use.

From a technology point of view, Linea focuses on full EVM equivalence. Ethereum apps can move to Linea without changing their code. Developers can scale their apps safely. Financial apps, in particular, benefit from this reliability.  

That said, Layer-2 is highly competitive. Networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base already have more users and bigger ecosystems. Linea will need to attract top apps. It must also continue to improve speed, decentralization, and security to remain competitive and an ideal choice for users.

Linea offers a practical and scalable solution for Ethereum users and developers. It delivers lower fees, faster transactions, and reliable EVM compatibility. Its zero-knowledge rollup technology and strong backing from Consensys position it as a solid Layer-2 network within the Ethereum ecosystem. While adoption is still growing, Linea offers a secure and accessible way to utilize decentralized applications, bridge assets, and participate in a token-driven 

The primary purpose of the Linea network is to help scale Ethereum. Linea improves transaction speed, reduces fees, and reduces congestion on the Ethereum mainnet. It also allows developers to use Ethereum smart contracts and lets users interact with dApps more easily.

Yes. Linea is a good investment. It may interest users who follow Ethereum scaling projects, but like all crypto assets, it carries risk.

Yes. You can move ETH and other assets from the Ethereum mainnet to Linea using official bridges. This allows you to pay lower fees and receive faster transaction confirmations while still using Ethereum apps.

Linea is used for running smart contracts, utilizing DeFi platforms, trading tokens, and interacting with NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. Its low-cost, fast transactions make it useful for both developers and daily users.

In a stunning revelation from early 2018, documents show Elon Musk briefly championed a revolutionary $10 billion OpenAI ICO before his dramatic departure from the company. This pivotal moment, reported by CoinDesk in January 2025, illuminates a crucial crossroads where artificial intelligence development nearly intersected with blockchain fundraising at an unprecedented scale. The proposal emerged during cryptocurrency's peak frenzy, offering a fascinating glimpse into alternative funding paths for transformative technologies.

Internal documents from January 2018 reveal specific parameters for the proposed OpenAI initial coin offering. Elon Musk and OpenAI founders discussed creating a token that would grant holders access to future AI services or computing resources. The $10 billion target would have dwarfed most traditional venture capital rounds, potentially distributing tokens to thousands of global investors. This approach mirrored contemporary blockchain projects that promised utility rather than equity.

Historical context clarifies why this method gained consideration. The 2017-2018 period witnessed extraordinary ICO activity, with projects like Filecoin raising $257 million and Telegram securing $1.7 billion through private token sales. Regulatory frameworks remained ambiguous globally, creating a window for innovative fundraising. Meanwhile, OpenAI faced substantial computational costs for training advanced models, estimated at millions monthly for cloud infrastructure.

Elon Musk withdrew his support within weeks of the initial proposal. Multiple factors likely influenced this reversal. First, regulatory scrutiny intensified dramatically in early 2018 as the SEC began classifying certain tokens as securities. Second, Tesla's own challenges demanded increased attention, particularly regarding Model 3 production and Autopilot development. Third, Musk expressed growing concerns about AI safety and commercialization timelines.

His subsequent resignation from the OpenAI board in February 2018 created significant organizational shifts. Musk cited potential future conflicts with Tesla's AI work as the primary reason. This departure occurred just as OpenAI transitioned from a non-profit to a “capped-profit” structure, a move that would eventually enable Microsoft's $1 billion investment in 2019. The abandoned ICO proposal represents a road not taken in the organization's funding evolution.

Blockchain analysts note the proposal's timing coincided with peak ICO enthusiasm but increasing regulatory pressure. “The first quarter of 2018 saw both record fundraising and mounting SEC warnings,” explains Dr. Sarah Chen, cryptocurrency historian at Stanford University. “Projects began facing legal challenges for unregistered securities offerings, creating substantial risk for high-profile initiatives.”

Several key developments shaped this period:

The abandoned OpenAI ICO proposal highlights fundamental questions about financing transformative technologies. Traditional venture capital, while substantial, often imposes different constraints and expectations than token-based fundraising. ICOs theoretically enable broader participation and align incentives through utility tokens rather than equity. However, they also introduce regulatory complexity and market volatility.

OpenAI ultimately pursued hybrid funding approaches. The organization secured:

This diversified strategy contrasts sharply with the single massive ICO initially contemplated. Each approach carries distinct advantages regarding control, regulatory exposure, and community building. The ICO model might have created a decentralized ecosystem of developers and users invested in the platform's success through token ownership.

Elon Musk's redirected focus toward Tesla's artificial intelligence initiatives proved prescient. Tesla began developing custom AI chips in 2018, leading to the Full Self-Driving computer's 2019 deployment. The company's Dojo supercomputer project, announced in 2021, represents another massive AI infrastructure investment. These parallel developments suggest Musk channeled his AI ambitions toward vertically integrated applications rather than general research platforms.

Financial analysts note Tesla's market capitalization grew from approximately $60 billion in early 2018 to over $800 billion by 2025. This valuation increase provided resources far exceeding the proposed ICO's $10 billion target. However, the funding mechanisms differ fundamentally—public market equity versus token sales—with implications for investor rights, liquidity, and regulatory oversight.

The revealed OpenAI ICO discussions gain new relevance amid 2025's AI and blockchain convergence. Modern decentralized AI projects like Bittensor and SingularityNET employ token-based models for coordinating distributed computation. These initiatives face similar questions about governance, incentive alignment, and regulatory compliance that the 2018 proposal encountered.

Several key differences distinguish current approaches:

The proposal's $10 billion scale remains extraordinary by contemporary standards. For comparison, the largest cryptocurrency venture rounds in 2024 reached approximately $500 million. This magnitude reflects both the period's exuberance and AI infrastructure's substantial capital requirements. Training advanced models like GPT-4 reportedly cost over $100 million, with future generations requiring exponentially more resources.

The Elon Musk OpenAI ICO proposal represents a fascinating historical footnote with enduring implications. This $10 billion fundraising plan, briefly supported then abandoned, highlights critical moments in both artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency evolution. The decision to pursue traditional investment instead shaped OpenAI's development path and governance structure significantly. Meanwhile, Musk's redirected focus toward Tesla's AI ambitions produced substantial autonomous driving advancements. As AI and blockchain technologies continue converging, this revealed proposal offers valuable perspective on funding mechanisms for transformative technologies. The Elon Musk OpenAI ICO consideration ultimately demonstrates how financing choices can redirect technological trajectories in profound ways.

Q1: What was the proposed purpose of the OpenAI ICO tokens?The documents suggest tokens would provide access to future AI services or computing resources, creating a utility-based ecosystem rather than equity ownership.

Q2: Why did Elon Musk withdraw support for the ICO?Multiple factors likely contributed, including increasing regulatory scrutiny of token sales, Tesla's growing AI priorities, and concerns about AI safety and commercialization timelines.

Q3: How does this proposal compare to modern AI crypto projects?Current decentralized AI initiatives employ more sophisticated token economics and operate under clearer regulatory frameworks, but share similar goals of democratizing access and aligning incentives.

Q4: What fundraising path did OpenAI ultimately pursue?The organization secured traditional venture funding, including Microsoft's $1 billion investment, alongside revenue from API access and strategic partnerships.

Q5: How might AI development differ if the ICO had proceeded?A token-based model might have created more decentralized governance and broader community participation, potentially accelerating certain applications while introducing different regulatory challenges.

The Chen Zhi arrest might push bitcoin prices down temporarily, but analysts said other factors will have greater sway in the long term

The seizure of enormous cryptocurrency caches in two high-profile criminal cases in China – a former head of the central bank's digital currency research institute accused of corruption, and an alleged scam centre kingpin linked to about US$15 billion in bitcoin – have sparked questions in the country about the safety and future of virtual money.

But analysts said the long-term trend for the assets, especially bitcoin, depended on institutional capital, interest rate expectations and the likelihood of the United States' Digital Asset Market Clarity Act being signed into law this year.

“While Chen is accused of crypto fraud and probably some element of coercion to scam investors, that is a separate issue to bitcoin's price drop at the start of 2026, which is now at about 30 per cent lower than its all-time high,” said Sanjeev Aaron Williams, a Hong Kong-based lawyer who writes on geopolitical risk and the digital economy.

The trading of crypto assets has been banned for years in mainland China. The Chinese central bank, which has doubled down on efforts to promote the digital yuan, pledged a further crackdown on virtual money in October despite market calls for the introduction of yuan stablecoins.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Stablecoins will shake up the $900 billion remittance market—setting up a fight between crypto firms and legacy brands like Western Union","https://fortune.com/2026/01/17/stablecoins-could-fix-a-broken-international-payments-system/","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 11:30:00 GMT","

Every year, workers around the globe send approximately $900 billion to their families back home and, when it comes to helping them send that money, the market is suddenly up for grabs. The reason is the recent momentum behind stablecoins, which offer an easy way to move money across borders—and for a far cheaper price than legacy transfer systems, whose fees can reach as high as 6%.

Stablecoins, which are backed by reserves designed to peg their value to a fiat currency like the dollar, were long used by experienced crypto traders. Today, millions of ordinary people are using them too via digital wallets. All of this raises an intriguing business question: What companies are best poised to capitalize on the new stablecoin trend?

Will it be a legacy remittance player, like a Western Union or MoneyGram? Or will it be a crypto-native company, like a Kraken or Coinbase, or instead PayPal or one of the growing number of fintechs entering the stablecoin space?

While the emerging stablecoin industry is there for the taking, experts say that both legacy remittance players and newer entrants each possess their own set of advantages and challenges. 

When people send money across borders, fees are steep. The World Bank found in a report earlier this year that the average fee for sending remittances was more than 6%. That cost can be grating over time, especially for low-income immigrants sending money back to developing countries. 

“People are spending extraordinary sums to send money abroad,” said Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in financial regulation. “This impacts how much the most cash-strapped and vulnerable people have in their pocket because some middle person is taking money for no good reason.”

This is where stablecoins could step in. Thanks to blockchain technology, these digital tokens can make international payments faster and at lower costs. The International Monetary Fund recently published an article about how this digital currency could improve payments and global finance. 

Stablecoins have also become a priority in the financial world since President Donald Trump signed the Genius Act in July. The legislation established a regulatory framework for the digital currency. Since then, major remittance players, like Western Union and PayPal, have developed their stablecoin offerings. 

When it comes to widespread adoption of stablecoins for remittances, traditional players, like Western Union, have the advantage of an existing customer base around the world. This type of company already has established regulation in different countries. That's according to Nate Svensson, a senior equity research analyst at Deutsche Bank, who says that a company like Western Union has developed compliance internationally for decades, if not centuries. 

“I think [Western Union] has a lot of built in advantages relative to these nascent crypto players,” he said. 

Another analyst, Brett Horn from Morningstar, likewise suggested traditional remittance brands may hold the advantage in the race, citing their long history with clients. When asked about crypto startups who solely focus on remittances using stablecoins, he said, “A lot of times it sounds really good, but I think, frankly, [these startups] are waving away some real difficulties that they might have.”

On the other hand, crypto-native companies have an advantage in their familiarity with the technology and their ability to be nimble. The likes of Western Union, in contrast, may find it hard to move away from long-standing business practices that both the company and their customers know well. When it incorporates stablecoin transfers for remittances alongside its existing fiat transfer system, it essentially has two arms of its business competing with one another. 

“They're competing with themselves, and that's just a natural disincentive for things to change,” said Jessica Wachter, a professor of finance at The Wharton School, about legacy remittance players. “A startup would be basically all in on [stablecoins], whereas I'm not sure a [Western Union] would be all in on it.”

Besides legacy financial institutions and crypto startups, another kind of company is vying to win this fight—the bigger crypto companies. Kraken, for example, has an app where users can send and receive funds across more than a hundred countries. 

Regulation for this digital currency is still relatively new, as the Genius Act was only signed into law in July, and the development of the technology is still in its early stages. Yesha Yadav, the law professor at Vanderbilt University, thinks that stablecoins will become even more popular this year, as their consumer protection rules get firmed up. 

“I think stablecoins have an enormous runway to expand their footprint,” she said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","An endocrinologist tried a new weight loss approach and it worked","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260116035317.htm","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 09:34:37 GMT","

For a long time, endocrinologist Leigh Perreault, MD, felt uneasy about how weight management was handled in routine medical care. Too often, patients were sent home with the same advice to eat better and exercise more, even when it clearly was not enough.

""There was a moment I put my face in my hands and thought, 'What am I doing?' I would write a lot of prescriptions for patients' diabetes, their blood pressure, their lipids and all these other conditions,"" says Perreault, a professor of endocrinology, metabolism and diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine who practices in Westminster alongside primary care physicians.

She realized that many of those medications addressed symptoms rather than the root problem. ""None of these people want to be on these medications and I thought if I could just help them with their weight, many of these health concerns would probably go away,"" she says.

That realization set the stage for a new approach that would soon reshape how weight care could work in primary care settings.

A New System Called PATHWEIGH

Perreault and her colleagues created PATHWEIGH, a structured process that helps patients and primary care teams focus directly on weight management. The program introduces dedicated clinic visits where providers can concentrate specifically on weight related care instead of squeezing it into a standard appointment.

With funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), PATHWEIGH was rolled out across UCHealth's 56 primary care clinics throughout Colorado to evaluate its impact. The pilot included 274,182 patients, making it one of the largest randomized trials ever conducted in this area.

Results published by Perreault and her team in Nature Medicine showed that the program reduced population weight gain by 0.58 kg over 18 months and shifted the overall trend from steady gain to weight loss -- an outcome with major implications for public health.

The program also made patients more likely to receive help for weight issues. Participation increased the chances of receiving weight related care by 23%.

""With PATHWEIGH, we showed that we absolutely eliminated population weight gain across all of our primary care, which has never been done previously,"" Perreault says.

As a result, obesity specialists are now pointing to PATHWEIGH as a possible standard of care, and several health systems around the country are exploring how to adopt it.

Building a Clear Path to Weight Care

Perreault describes PATHWEIGH as a way to align patients and clinicians around a shared plan.

""If you think about weight loss medicine or surgery or a weight loss program, those are all vehicles to weight loss,"" she says. ""We built a highway that we could put all the vehicles on, so there's actually a process for people to receive weight related care if they wanted it.""

The process began with something simple. Clinics posted signs letting patients know they could request an appointment focused entirely on weight management by asking at the front desk.

That request automatically activated a workflow in the electronic health record. Patients received a survey, and once completed, their responses flowed directly into the clinician's notes. This allowed visits to focus less on background information and more on practical next steps.

""It made the whole process really efficient, and then effectively turned our note template into a menu of anything that we might do,"" Perreault says. ""It really made it extremely time efficient and consolidated everything we might do for a patient into one interface.""

Removing Barriers and Awkward Conversations

Data collected over 18 months showed that about one in four eligible patients received some form of weight related care at least once during the trial. Most of that care involved lifestyle counseling, but prescriptions for anti-obesity medications doubled during the intervention.

Unlike many one-size-fits-all weight loss programs, PATHWEIGH allowed treatment to be customized to each patient. It also reduced the discomfort that often surrounds conversations about weight in medical settings.

""Most people who want or need weight related care never get it. Either they don't ask for it or the providers don't bring it up, and if they do, the patient usually gets told to go home and eat less and exercise more, and then nothing happens,"" Perreault says. ""The person gets frustrated and they learn to not ask for help anymore, because it's kind of embarrassing and it doesn't help. This was a safe space to say, 'Hey, if you would like medical assistance with your weight, we actually have a process for you to receive that now.'""

Why Small Changes Matter at Scale

Experts estimate that rising obesity rates are driven by an average population weight gain of about .5kg per year. Stopping that increase and turning it into even modest weight loss could make a meaningful difference in slowing the obesity epidemic.

""While it's not a significant difference on an individual patient level, it's a huge deal on a population and public health level,"" Perreault says.

Researchers also found that patients who received clear weight related care through PATHWEIGH experienced greater weight loss. Even patients who did not receive direct interventions saw reduced weight gain compared with what would normally be expected.

Expanding Beyond Colorado

Perreault says the program's success has opened the door to wider adoption. Plans are underway to expand PATHWEIGH beyond Colorado. The Obesity Association, which is developing its first standards of care for obesity, is highlighting the program as a recommended care process.

Five health systems across seven states are also considering PATHWEIGH as its creators work toward licensing the model.

""I'm really proud that PATHWEIGH was home-grown and built and tested here in Colorado,"" Perreault says. ""This is the blueprint that moves us forward.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Tiny earthquakes are revealing a dangerous secret beneath California","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260117053529.htm","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 16:15:05 GMT","

By closely tracking swarms of extremely small earthquakes, scientists are gaining new insight into a dangerous and complicated region off the Northern California coast. This area marks the meeting point of the San Andreas fault and the Cascadia subduction zone, a place capable of producing powerful and destructive earthquakes. The research was carried out by scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, the University of California, Davis and the University of Colorado Boulder, and was published Jan. 15 in Science.

""If we don't understand the underlying tectonic processes, it's hard to predict the seismic hazard,"" said coauthor Amanda Thomas, professor of earth and planetary sciences at UC Davis.

A Seismic Crossroads Beneath the Coast

The Mendocino Triple Junction lies offshore from Humboldt County, where three major tectonic plates converge. South of this junction, the Pacific plate moves roughly northwest alongside the North American plate, creating the San Andreas fault. To the north, the Gorda (or Juan de Fuca) plate moves northeast and sinks beneath the North American plate, descending into the Earth's mantle in a process known as subduction.

Although this arrangement may appear simple on a map, scientists say the real structure below the surface is far more complicated. One striking example came from a large (magnitude 7.2) earthquake in 1992 that struck at a much shallower depth than expected.

Looking Below the Surface

First author David Shelly of the USGS Geologic Hazards Center in Golden, Colo., said the challenge is similar to studying an iceberg.

""You can see a bit at the surface, but you have to figure out what is the configuration underneath,"" Shelly said.

To uncover that hidden structure, Shelly and his colleagues used a dense network of seismometers across the Pacific Northwest. The instruments recorded extremely small ""low-frequency"" earthquakes that occur where tectonic plates slowly slide against or over one another. These tiny events are thousands of times weaker than earthquakes people can feel at the surface.

The team tested their underground model by examining how these small earthquakes respond to tidal forces. Just as the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon affects ocean tides, it also places subtle stress on tectonic plates. When those forces line up with the natural direction of plate movement, the number of small earthquakes increases, Thomas said.

Five Moving Pieces Beneath Northern California

The researchers found that the region involves five moving pieces rather than just three major plates, with two of them hidden deep below the surface.

At the southern end of the Cascadia subduction zone, the team discovered that a portion of the North American plate has broken away and is being dragged downward along with the Gorda plate as it sinks beneath North America.

South of the triple junction, the Pacific plate is pulling a mass of rock known as the Pioneer fragment beneath the North American plate as it moves northwards. The fault separating the Pioneer fragment from the North American plate lies nearly flat and cannot be seen at the surface.

The Pioneer fragment was once part of the Farallon plate, an ancient tectonic plate that once extended along the California coastline and has since mostly disappeared.

Explaining a Puzzling Earthquake

This updated model helps explain why the 1992 earthquake occurred at such a shallow depth. According to Materna, the surface being pushed beneath North America is not as deep as scientists previously believed.

""It had been assumed that faults follow the leading edge of the subducting slab, but this example deviates from that,"" Materna said. ""The plate boundary seems not to be where we thought it was.""

The work was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists are rethinking bamboo as a powerful new superfood","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260116035313.htm","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 04:03:22 GMT","

The first-ever academic review focused on bamboo as a food has uncovered a wide range of possible health benefits. Researchers found evidence suggesting bamboo consumption may help regulate blood sugar, reduce inflammation, support digestive health, and provide antioxidant effects.

Bamboo is known as the fastest growing plant on the planet, with some species capable of growing up to 90cm in a single day. While China and India are the largest producers and bamboo shoots are already common in many Asian cuisines, the findings suggest bamboo could become an important food option for diets around the world.

Nutritional Profile of Bamboo Shoots

Bamboo shoots offer a strong nutritional profile. They are rich in protein, contain moderate amounts of fiber, and are naturally low in fat. Bamboo also provides essential amino acids, along with minerals such as selenium and potassium. In addition, it supplies several vitamins, including thiamine, niacin, vitamin A, vitamin B6, and vitamin E.

The review was carried out by researchers from Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) in England. It is the first study to bring together and analyze all existing research on bamboo consumption, covering both human trials (in vivo studies) and laboratory experiments conducted on human cells (in vitro studies).

Potential Benefits for Metabolic and Heart Health

According to the review, bamboo shoots may play a role in improving metabolic health. Human trials reported better glycemic control, suggesting bamboo could help regulate blood sugar levels, which is especially important for managing diabetes. Researchers also observed improvements in lipid profiles, a change associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.

Digestive Support and Gut Health Effects

Bamboo contains several types of dietary fiber, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. These fibers have been shown to improve bowel function in human participants. Additional studies reported increased antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity after bamboo consumption, along with reduced cell toxicity and improved cell viability.

Laboratory research further supported bamboo's nutritional value and antioxidant strength. These experiments also identified probiotic effects, indicating bamboo may help support gut health by encouraging the growth of beneficial bacteria.

Researchers also found that compounds found in bamboo can inhibit the formation of furan and reduce the production of acrylamide. Both substances are toxic chemicals that can form when certain foods are fried or roasted. This suggests bamboo could potentially be used to make some cooked foods safer.

Preparation Risks and Safety Concerns

Despite its benefits, the review also highlighted important safety risks. Some bamboo species contain cyanogenic glycosides, which can release cyanide if the shoots are eaten raw or improperly prepared.

One study also found that bamboo shoots may contain compounds that interfere with thyroid hormone production. This interference can increase the risk of developing goiter, a condition linked to multiple health complications. Both of these risks can be avoided by properly pre-boiling bamboo shoots before consumption.

What Researchers Say About Bamboo's Future

Senior author Lee Smith, Professor of Public Health at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), said: ""Bamboo is already commonly eaten in parts of Asia and it has huge potential to be a healthy, sustainable addition to diets worldwide -- but it must be prepared correctly.

""The multiple health benefits we identified, including its potential to tackle modern health challenges like diabetes and heart disease, are likely due to the nutritional content of bamboo and its extracts, with bamboo rich in proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins.

""Our review shows bamboo's clear promise as a possible 'superfood', but there are also gaps in our knowledge. We could only find four studies involving human participants that met our criteria, so additional high-quality human trials are necessary before we can make firm recommendations.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","How scientists are turning thyme into precision medicine","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260117053528.htm","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 14:50:07 GMT","

Thyme extract is often described as a powerful natural remedy because of its wide range of health effects. This reputation comes from several biologically active compounds -- thymol, carvacrol, rosmarinic acid, and caffeic acid -- that are known to support immune function while also offering anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant benefits.

Despite its potential, thyme extract has practical drawbacks that limit how it can be used. It evaporates quickly (a waste of thyme!), which makes storage and precise delivery difficult. In larger amounts, it can also irritate the body, sometimes leading to skin rashes or digestive discomfort.

A New Way to Preserve and Control Thyme Extract

Scientists have identified a way to solve both of these problems by sealing extremely small droplets of thyme extract inside another liquid. This approach allows the extract to be delivered in very small doses while preventing evaporation. Researchers from Tomsk Polytechnic University and Surgut State University in Russia developed this method for creating encapsulated nanodoses of thyme. Their findings were published in Physics of Fluids, by AIP Publishing.

How the Encapsulation Process Works

The process relies on carefully controlled streams of thyme extract, gelatin, sodium alginate -- a commonly used thickening agent in the food industry -- and oil. First, the researchers combined thyme extract with gelatin and pushed this mixture through a tiny chip at the same time as a stream of sodium alginate. Inside the chip, the two liquids flowed together while remaining clearly separated. A stream of oil introduced from a perpendicular direction then broke the combined flow into extremely small droplets, each one fully encapsulated.

Why Precision Nanodosing Matters

The most important outcome of this research is not the specific amount of thyme extract used, but the proof that precise and consistent nanodosing is achievable. Before this approach can be applied in medicine, additional work will be needed to package these nanodoses into oral capsules suitable for pharmaceutical use.

""The system tends to be self-regulating in order to deliver a relatively consistent dose, which is valuable for drug delivery,"" said author Maxim Piskunov. ""At the same time, changing and adjusting the diameter of the microdroplets containing a biologically active substance nanodose is only possible by varying the oil phase flow rate.""

Applications Beyond Medicine

The researchers emphasize that the technique is not limited to thyme extract alone. It could also be used for other substances and has potential applications outside pharmaceuticals, including the food industry. Piskunov added that combining this method with machine vision and artificial intelligence could allow real-time monitoring and control of nanodosing.

""We believe that this method can be used to encapsulate various aqueous extracts,"" said Piskunov. ""From our study, no significant limitations have been identified. Moreover, we are currently working on encapsulating a water-alcohol extract with a much higher concentration of biologically active substances.""

I'm a huge fan of the Kitchen Confidential subreddit and have been since I first read Anthony Bourdain's book of the same name back in 2013. The community is full of snarky line cooks, stressed-out front-of-house staff, and dishwashers quietly holding the whole operation together (much like they do in real life).

If you scroll Reddit often, you might be familiar with this subreddit because of its surge in popularity when a user called F1exican started posting a pile of cut chives every day until the subreddit deemed them perfect. (It finally happened a few weeks ago, technically after 69 days, because of course it did.) There were cats. There were brand controversies. There were endless hand-drawn planes and hearts. It was maybe my favorite internet phenomenon since Vine was still a thing.

Left bereft of its Chivelord and his daily posting, the subreddit quickly moved on to a new meme: Paris Hilton cookware. While scrolling, it dawned on me that I happened to have a few pieces of this very cookware in my never-ending “to test” pile of gear. There are sharpeners, Dutch ovens, knife sets, thermometers, and more, but I had a knife block and some nonstick pots and pans. So here I am to share my thoughts, from one humble home-chef-Reddit-scroller to the internet at large. (I come in peace!)

Paris Hilton

Amazon

It feels important here to note that I generally love Paris Hilton. I love her bimbo-fied accent, I love her hit single “Stars Are Blind,” and I love her perfume. I also think it's important to point out that I am the resident WIRED Reviews team “color pink” enthusiast. But I am sorry to say that her knife block is not it.

The Paris Hilton cleaver has been out of stock since I started looking for it, but this knife block is still available, as are several other iterations with slightly fancier bases or different inclusions. My set came with an 8-inch chef's knife, a 5-inch utility knife, a 5-inch Santoku knife, a 3.5-inch paring knife, and six serrated steak knives, as well as a pair of shears with a built-in bottle opener. The blades are “high-carbon stainless steel.”

Fitting the steak knives into their dedicated slots in the rubberwood knife block was a master class in overcoming my sensory difficulties. As the serrated teeth of each blade bit into the soft, pliable wood of the block, I wondered out loud to myself whether I was placing them correctly. They wiggled around with abandon, barely seated unless I babied each one home. We were off to an excellent start.

The steak and paring knives were perfectly plasticized, with a slippery grip and short, lightweight handles that made me fear I would stab myself at any given moment. I'm not a professional line cook, but I am an adept home chef, and these knives made me nervous. When it was time to hand-wash and “dry immediately” per the manufacturer's instructions, I could look forward to finagling them with utmost care to their dedicated slots along the bottom of the knife block, where at least one serrated tooth would inevitably catch and be just inconvenient enough to elicit a sigh.

The paring and utility knives were not much better, with their powdery, soft-touch handles and awkward finger guards. If I were slicing the daintiest and firmest of fruits, perhaps they'd do. Perhaps. They were cute—and that is about it.

I was really looking forward to testing the chef's and Santoku knives, and of course, I used them to cut chives in my best impression of my favorite chef on Reddit.

On the Santoku knife, the bolster (where the blade meets the handle) seemed barely seated, and the handle was too short for even my small hands to feel comfortable. I'm used to the Kiwi cleaver, which feels like an extension of myself. Nevertheless, I persisted, having bought my local rural grocery store out of chives (meaning three tiny, slightly sad packages).

In use, the Santoku knife is fine. I guess. Nothing to write home about, but not the worst knife I've ever used. The short blade would make quick work of things like fingerling potatoes or carrots, though it lost its edge quickly, particularly near the bolster. The small design makes it hard to scoop up your prepped ingredients, furthering the impression that these are children's toys. (Legal disclaimer: These are not children's toys.)

The chef's knife is better, which admittedly is not saying much. It's very rocky and lightweight. I prefer a heavier knife, especially considering how slippery the handle feels. But I was able to slice through my pile of chives, plus garlic and onions. That's the best assessment I can give: I was able to use this knife to cut things. Did I mention that my beloved Kiwi cleaver costs $15?

One Reddit user mentioned that the knives leach color, which I'm not surprised about, given my aforementioned “these are basically children's toys” note. (Chefs on the subreddit have echoed my sentiments.)

Paris Hilton

Walmart

Amazon

This Paris Hilton cookware set would've been the perfect gift for me when I got my first apartment. Unfortunately, that was 10 years ago. (Stay tuned for our buying guide for nonstick pans, which will be published soon!)

The exact set that I tested is no longer available online, but a very similar version exists that includes the same main pots and pans. (Which is probably a good thing, because my set came with nylon tools that were not as heat-safe as they should be, and the new set includes silicone versions.)

The pots and pans are very, very cute, with a glittery ceramic nonstick coating, a pink body, and gold, heart-shaped handles on the lids. The nonstick performed well. (The manufacturer recommends using low or medium heat, but I tested on high, too.) Eggs released without a trace, and melted American cheese was easy to scrape away.

I did notice some scuffing on the bottom of the pan after shuffling it around my gas stove burner, but the finish stayed intact.

The handles stayed cool to the touch, but they're a little hard to grip. Every pan is on the lightweight side, and they aren't oven-safe. The product page advertises that they're easy to clean in the dishwasher, but you shouldn't put nonstick pans through the dishwasher! Hand-clean and dry them to preserve the coating for as long as possible. According to the manufacturer, the pans are made ""without PFAS, PFOA, PFOS & PTFE.”

Overall, I think they're fine? They're fine. But it's not my favorite nonstick Our Place Always Pan, and I think it's better to invest in one or two really good pans than an entire set of just OK options. If this is your very first cookware set, and you really want something pink and girly, go for it. Just be aware that you'll likely be investing in another set within a couple of years—I don't have faith that these would hold up well over time, especially with daily use.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a Dutch oven to order. (And some chive chopping skills to finesse.)

Leaders at Mira Murati's Thinking Machines Lab confronted the startup's cofounder and former CTO, Barret Zoph, over an alleged relationship with another employee last summer, WIRED has learned.

That relationship was likely the alleged “misconduct” that has been mentioned in prior reporting, including by WIRED.

To protect the privacy of the individuals involved, WIRED is not naming the employee in question. The individual, who worked in a different department than Zoph and was in a leadership role, is no longer at the lab.

Murati approached Zoph to discuss the relationship, sources say. The cofounders' working relationship broke down in the months following that conversation, according to multiple sources, and Zoph started speaking to competitors about other opportunities.

Before Zoph left the company, he was in conversation with leaders from Meta Superintelligence Labs, according to a source familiar with the matter. Zoph was ultimately hired by OpenAI. OpenAI's CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, said the hiring had been in the works for weeks. Simo also noted that she did not share Thinking Machines' concerns over Zoph's ethics.

Zoph and OpenAI declined to comment for this story.

This week, a third Thinking Machines cofounder, Luke Metz, and at least three other researchers from Murati's startup also departed for OpenAI. In October, the startup's cofounder Andrew Tulloch left for Meta.

While tensions between Murati and Zoph came to a head in recent days, they do not entirely explain the broader exodus of Thinking Machines employees.

WIRED previously reported that there was misalignment within Thinking Machines about what the startup should build.

In November, Murati's startup was reportedly looking to raise capital at a $50 billion valuation, up from its current valuation of $12 billion.

Thinking Machines Lab declined to comment for this story.

This week at the Brussels Motor Show, Kia unveiled its most important EV for 2026, the diminutive EV2, a shrunken version of its supersized SUV, the EV9. Kia has managed to make the boxy design endearing, making the electric vehicle appear ready for any urban adventure you wish to throw at it.

Being an entry-level electric car, the EV2 will apparently retail somewhere around $32,000, but don't be fooled by the price or small size (it's barely more than 13 feet long)—the top-spec version will have a 61-kWh battery that should be good for just shy of 280  miles. Meanwhile, the 400-volt e‑GMP platform lets you recharge in 30 minutes from 10 to 80 percent.

This is a city car, so adjust your performance expectations accordingly. Still, the EV2 is good for 144 horsepower, a zero to 60 mph time of 8.6 seconds, and a top speed of 99 mph—more than enough for school and supermarket runs, as well as freeway missions.

Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, and the quality interior continues with USB-C charging ports alongside a domestic plug socket, lots of storage, a triple‑screen infotainment setup, seating available in four‑ or five‑seat layouts, and a maximum of 403 liters of trunk space. With all this in such a small package, the EV2 should do very well for Kia. —Jeremy White

Fujifilm has announced two new Instax instant cameras and printers: the Mini Link+, a printer, and the Mini Evo Cinema hybrid instant camera, which looks something like a Super 8 film camera from the 1970s.

The Mini Link+ is a straightforward update to the Mini Link smartphone-to-printer line, with many of the same features, including the ability to add text, graphics, illustrations, and more to your images, along with different frame options. The outer design is different in the Link+, though, with a boxy look reminiscent of some external hard drive cases I've used.

The Mini Evo Cinema is far more interesting, bringing video to the Instax line. It can shoot up to 15-second clips, which you can then share via a QR code printed on an Instax print. The same process has been around for a while with other Instax cameras, like the recently released Mini LiPlay+, though until now, these have only relied on audio or videos made from stills. Fujifilm says the design is based on the Fujica Single-8 camera. A particularly nice touch is the way the Instax logo has been done to mimic the old cine camera logos.

The Mini Evo has what Fujifilm is calling an “Eras Dial” that lets you style your images to look like the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and so on up through 2020. Depending on your age, you will likely find this appealing or cringe-inducing. I tend toward the latter camp, but some of these are actually quite well done based on the prints Fujifilm has shared. The 1930s setting does a nice job of mimicking the soft black and white look of cinema in that era (if you're not familiar, watch Angels with Dirty Faces).

The Mini Evo Cinema camera will be available in early February 2026 for $410. You can preorder it right now. —Scott Gilbertson

Ricoh unveiled a new Monochrome GR IV camera, which comes on the heels of the new, full-color GR IV released late last year. Aside from Leica, Ricoh is the only other company making black-and-white cameras, like the monochrome version of the Pentax K-3.

It might seem strange to buy a camera that can only shoot black-and-white when you can take the output of a color sensor and convert it to black and white afterward. But having shot with both the K-3 monochrome and the Leica M10 Monochrome, I can vouch that there is definitely a better tonal range from a monochrome sensor compared to converting in post. If you're a dedicated black-and-white shooter, it's worth considering. I really like the idea of a pocketable monochrome camera that doesn't have a Leica price attached to it.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

The GR IV monochrome is essentially the same camera as the GR IV—same lens, same internals aside from the sensor. Inside the GR IV is a 26-megapixel sensor with no color filter array. Based on my experience with other monochrome sensors, you can expect marginally less shadow noise and slightly better high ISO performance compared to the color version. I especially like that there will be an optional built-in red filter for upping contrast.

The big downside is that the monochrome GR IV costs $2,200, a full $700 more than the color version. You can preorder one today, and the camera should ship around the middle of February. —Scott Gilbertson

Big news for guitarists and fans of home recording: After having purchased PreSonus in 2021, Fender has decided to rebrand the music production software previously known as PreSonus Studio One as Fender Studio Pro.

The move comes in addition to several native amplifier and effects pedal models that are now included in the re-skinned app, as well as a few other features that should keep longtime Studio One users (like yours truly) happy. I am very excited about the new timeline view at the top of the screen, for example, which makes it easier to track where I am in the context of the overall track when recording overdubs.

The name makes everything easier to understand for Fender users, who can use the Fender Studio app (akin to GarageBand) on their tablets and mobile devices, then easily export it to Fender Studio Pro for more in-depth recording. It also makes Fender the only major instrument manufacturer that owns its own top-tier recording software.

I have been testing a preview version of the software for several weeks and have been impressed with the update's streamlined looks and added functionality, though admittedly, I am not the biggest power user out there. —Parker Hall

After the much-admired white-dial Speedmaster Professional in 2024, Omega clearly feels that now is the time to give its most iconic wristwatch a new “reverse-panda” makeover. Instead of a classic “panda” design of white dial and black sub-dials, the aesthetic is switched (hence the name), and it's just the sort of style tweak that makes collectors come running.

Landing in 18-karat yellow gold ($49,300) and a more attainable steel version ($10,400), these two new Speedys are essentially identical to Omega's current Moonwatch models, apart from ceramic bezels and those reverse-panda dials, which actually consist of two layers. This means that the recessed sub-dials are now positioned slightly deeper in the dial. The dial also has a glossy, varnished, and lacquered (with more than 20 layers) finish to create a sheen. Both have the caliber 3861 inside, offering up resistance to magnetic fields of up to 15,000 gauss and a 50-hour power reserve.

Yes, this certainly isn't a radical redesign from Omega, but, with the Rolex Daytona firmly in its sights, releases such as this further the brand's more upmarket ambitions—the lower cost reverse-panda, after all, marks a steel Moonwatch stepping over the $10K threshold for the very first time. —Jeremy White

                                What happens here matters everywhere

NASA's massive Space Launch System rocket crept toward its Florida launch pad today at a top speed of about 1 mph, marking the first step in a journey that will eventually send astronauts around the moon for the first time in more than 50 years.

The 4-mile trek to Launch Complex 39B at NASA's Kennedy Space Center began at 7 a.m. ET (4 a.m. PT) and was expected to take about 12 hours. Because the rocket and its mobile launcher stand more than 300 feet tall and weigh more than 10 million pounds, the trip requires the use of a crawler-transporter — the same vehicle used for the Apollo and space shuttle programs, now upgraded for NASA's Artemis moon program.

Liftoff for the Artemis 2 mission could come as early as Feb. 6, but there's lots to be done in the weeks ahead. After today's rollout, the mission team will conduct a thorough checkout of the Space Launch System and its Orion crew spacecraft. Then there'll be a “wet dress rehearsal,” during which the launch team will fuel the rocket and count down to T-minus 29 seconds.

“We have, I think, zero intention of communicating an actual launch date until we get through wet dress,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman told reporters.

Artemis 2 is slated to send three NASA astronauts and one Canadian astronaut on a 10-day journey tracing a figure-8 route around the moon. The trip will take them as far as 4,800 miles beyond the lunar far side — farther out than any human has gone before.

One of the crew members, Christina Koch, recalled an exchange she had with Apollo 13's Fred Haise at a commemorative event. “Before I even said, ‘Hello, sir, great to see you,' he goes, ‘I heard you're going to break our record,'” she said.

Mission commander Reid Wiseman said he's already seeing the moon in a different light. 

“One of the most magical things for me in this experience is, when I looked out a few mornings ago, there was a beautiful crescent in the morning sunrise, and I truly just see the far side,” he said. “You just think about all the landmarks we've been studying on that far side, and how amazing that will look. And seeing Earthrise, just flipping the moon over and seeing it from the other perspective, is what I think when I look out right now.”

Good morning, Moon. See you next month? pic.twitter.com/1FwBmxMEyZ

Although Artemis 2 will be historic in its own right, the mission's main purpose is to prepare the way for Artemis 3, which will put humans on the lunar surface for the first time since Apollo 17 in 1972. That mission is officially set for no earlier than mid-2027, but industry experts expect the schedule to slip.

During today's news briefing, Isaacman took an even longer view. “This is the start of a very long journey,” he said. “I hope someday my kids are going to be watching, maybe decades into the future, the Artemis 100 mission.”

Isaacman, who served as the billionaire CEO of the Shift4 payment processing company before becoming NASA's chief last month, said that America's space effort is sending humans back to the moon “to figure out the orbital and lunar economy, for all of the science and discovery possibilities that are out there, to inspire my kids, your kids, kids all around the world, to want to grow up and contribute to this unbelievable endeavor that we're on right now.” 

Several companies with a presence in the Seattle area are already part of that lunar economy. For example, L3Harris' facility in Redmond has been building thrusters for NASA's Orion spacecraft. Seattle-based Interlune is planning to bring helium-3 and other lunar resources back to Earth. And Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space venture, headquartered in Kent, is building a Blue Moon lander that's meant to put Artemis crews on the lunar surface starting in 2030.

Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket is expected to send an uncrewed cargo version of the Blue Moon lander to the moon sometime in the next few months. Isaacman hinted that Blue Origin could be in for a bigger role in the lunar economy as the Artemis program hits its stride.

“I will say I did meet with both Blue Origin and SpaceX on their acceleration plans. These are both very good plans,” he said. “If we are on track, we should be watching an awful lot of New Glenns and Starships launch in the years ahead.”

Washington Sen. Patty Murray believes the future of artificial intelligence shouldn't be dictated solely by billionaires and shareholders.

The longtime lawmaker toured research facilities at the University of Washington on Friday after securing $10 million in federal funding that will allow the UW to expand the infrastructure needed for data-intensive AI workloads. 

Sen. Murray said the funding will help provide a counterweight to AI development driven primarily by private capital.

“If just billionaires are creating and using AI for their own projects that make money, then we lose out on most of the benefits of AI,” Murray told GeekWire. 

Universities play a critical role in ensuring AI advances serve public needs, Murray said, pointing to applications ranging from healthcare and environmental research to workforce training and job creation.

The new funding, which comes through Congressionally Directed Spending in the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill, will support Tillicum, the UW's next-generation computing platform that launched in October.

University leaders say the investment will enable faster research cycles and broader access — while reducing reliance on commercial cloud providers.

“This allows us to stay at the cutting edge of AI and AI research,” said Andrew Connolly, director of the eScience Institute.

Unlike private companies that ultimately answer to shareholders, public universities answer to taxpayers, said Magdalena Balazinska, director of the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. “That means our goal is to do what's best for society,” she said.

Universities nationwide have struggled to keep pace with the rapid growth of AI computing demands, as private companies dominate access to large-scale infrastructure.

Balazinska called the new funding a “very significant amount,” saying that even relatively modest investments can be transformative in an academic setting. She added that access to computing resources is often the first question prospective faculty ask when considering whether they can be successful at the UW.

Murray on Friday visited the UW's eScience Institute, a data science and AI research hub for the university, and spoke with students about their work. A recurring theme during the tour was the importance of keeping sensitive data on campus.

Several students demonstrated AI projects that rely on large volumes of personal or scientific data, including a health-focused system that uses voice input and AI analysis to track symptoms and generate summaries for doctors. Researchers said developing such tools on UW-owned infrastructure avoids sending sensitive data to third-party cloud providers. Having in-house compute also allows students and faculty to iterate more quickly.

Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, framed the funding as foundational infrastructure and key to the economy in her home state.

“If you don't have the computers, if you don't have the basic infrastructure, you're stymied,” she said. “So this benefits everybody — whether it's creating jobs, whether it's creating better healthcare, whether it's creating more innovators who come here to Washington state to be able to create jobs for the future and make a better way of life for all of us.”

Murray also helped secure an additional $3 million for new fan blades at the UW's Kirsten Wind Tunnel, and $1.5 million for improvements to UW's Radiocarbon Lab. The broader federal spending bill boosts funding for other scientific agencies such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology, pushing back on proposals from President Trump to sharply cut federal research spending.

Elon Musk wants a jaw-dropping $79 billion to $134 billion in damages from OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming the AI company defrauded him by jettisoning its nonprofit mission, Bloomberg first reported. The figure comes from expert witness C. Paul Wazzan, a financial economist whose bio says he has been deposed nearly 100 times and testified at trial more than a dozen times in complex commercial litigation cases.

Wazzan, who specializes in valuation and damages calculations in high-stakes disputes, determined that Musk is entitled to a hefty portion of OpenAI's current $500 billion valuation based on his $38 million seed donation when he co-founded the startup in 2015. (If you're wondering, that would mean a 3,500-fold return on Musk's investment.)

Wazzan's analysis combines Musk's initial financial contributions with the technical know-how and business contributions he offered to OpenAI's early team, calculating wrongful gains of $65.5 billion to $109.4 billion for OpenAI and $13.3 billion to $25.1 billion for Microsoft, which today owns a 27% chunk of the company.

Musk's legal team argues he should be compensated as an early startup investor who sees returns “many orders of magnitude greater” than his initial investment. But the sheer scale of the damages demand underscores that this legal battle isn't really about the money.

Musk's personal fortune currently hovers around $700 billion, making him by far the world's richest person. As Reuters recently noted, his wealth now exceeds that of Google co-founder Larry Page, the world's second-richest person, by a stunning $500 billion, according to Forbes' billionaires list. In November, Tesla shareholders separately approved a $1 trillion pay package for Musk, the largest corporate pay package in history.

Against this backdrop, even a $134 billion payout from OpenAI would represent a relatively modest addition to Musk's wealth, likely reinforcing for those at OpenAI their characterization of the lawsuit as part of an “ongoing pattern of harassment” rather than a legitimate financial grievance. OpenAI already reportedly sent a letter Thursday to investors and others of its business partners, warning that Musk will make “deliberately outlandish, attention-grabbing claims” as his lawsuit against the company heads to trial in April. The case will be heard in Oakland, Calif., about 15 miles east of San Francisco.

Anahita Laverack was set on becoming an aerospace engineer, but her career took a different turn after a realization at an autonomous robotics challenge inspired her to launch Oshen, a company that builds fleets of robots that collect ocean data.

In 2021, Laverack, a storied sailor, decided to build and enter a robot in the Microtransat Challenge, a competition where participants build and send autonomous sail-powered micro-robots across the Atlantic Ocean. She, like everyone else that has tried this challenge, was unsuccessful.

“I realized half the reason that all of these attempts were failing is, number one, obviously it's hard to make micro-robots survive on the ocean,” Laverack told TechCrunch. “But number two, they don't have enough data on the ocean to know what the weather is or even know what the ocean conditions are like.”

Laverack set out for different conferences, like Oceanology International, to find this missing ocean data. She quickly realized that no one had really figured out a good way to collect it yet. Instead, she found people asking if they could pay her to try to collect the data herself. She figured that if people were willing to pay her for this data, she could try to build a way to capture it.

Those conversations were the basis for Oshen, which Laverack founded alongside Ciaran Dowds, an electrical engineer, in April 2022. 

The company now builds fleets of autonomous micro-robots, called C-Stars, that can survive in the ocean for 100 days straight and are deployed in swarms to collect ocean data.

But Oshen started small. Laverack said she and Dowds chose not to pursue venture capital right away when launching the company. Instead, they combined their savings to buy a 25-foot sailboat, lived at the cheapest marina in the United Kingdom, and used the vessel as their testing platform while getting the company off the ground.

For two years, Oshen would iterate on the bots on shore and immediately take them out on the water to test them.

“In the summer, that's not too bad,” Laverack said. “The problem is you really need your boats to work in all seasons. When your robot breaks, [and] it's a winter storm that's raging, a 25-foot sailboat shouldn't really be going out in those conditions. So, that led to some adventure, which I wouldn't say any more about, but there were certainly some interesting events there.”

Getting the tech just right was difficult, Laverack said, because it's not as easy as just taking an existing larger robot and shrinking it down. These bots needed to be mass deployable and cheap despite also needing to be technologically advanced enough to operate and collect data for long periods of time on their own.

Many other companies have successfully gotten two of the three correct, Laverack said. Oshen's ability to get all three started to attract customers across defense and government organizations.

The company caught the attention of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) two years ago, but Laverack said that their tech just wasn't ready to be deployed reliably yet. The organization reached back out two months before the 2025 hurricane season after Oshen had successfully deployed the robots into winter storms in the U.K. This time, Oshen jumped at the chance and quickly built and sent over 15 C-Stars.

Five of these C-Stars were thrown overboard and made their way into position by the U.S. Virgin Islands where NOAA predicted Hurricane Humberto was headed.

Laverack said they were expecting the bots to just collect data leading up to the storm, but instead, three of the bots were able to weather the entire storm — minus a few missing parts — and collected data the whole time, becoming, she says, the first ocean robot to collect data through a Category 5 hurricane.

Now, the company has moved to a hub for marine tech companies in Plymouth, England, and has started racking up contracts with customers, including the U.K. government, for both weather and defense operations.

Laverack said the company plans to raise venture capital soon to keep up with demand.

Stupid to run random scripts you find online, but browser makers push users into it.My son wants to eat ""Chinese""  food with chopsticks, but he can only really use a fork, so we adapt the chopsticks. He'll be able to use them eventually, but not everyone has a) the desire, nor b) the dexterity.Making it easier to do what users want with a computer without telling them 'just learn to program' (or script in this case) is actually a good thing imo.

I can see the use of LLMs and machine learning tools like TTS, translators and grammar checkers to be integrated to browser, but only depending on local models or better, like Firefox's case to CPU optimized local models.

reply

A lot of anti-AI backlash seems to exempt machine translation, which as far as I can tell is just because it's been around for so long that people are comfortable with it and don't see it as new or AI-y, which imho spells doom for a lot of this- in ten years automatic tab groups will seem just as natural and non-intrusive as machine translation.

reply

A local LLM that I explicitly bring up to ask a question and dismiss (ie no CPU or RAM usage) when I'm done consulting it is nice. A piece of software I'm using interrupting what I'm doing to ask me a useless and annoying question or to make an unsolicited change to my workspace leaves me thinking about permanently uninstalling it.I will never want automatic tab groups or automatic anything else. I don't even want an ""integrated"" desktop environment - I use i3 to get away from that. I hate all the useless bullshit half baked features that are constantly shoved in my face.If the modern web was compatible with it I'd use a text based browser for 90% of what I do online. And if that were the case I'd still welcome a built in machine translation feature because it's an incredibly useful tool.

The flow is 1) you drag a tab over another tab and it suggests a name for the tab group and 2) you click on a tab group and another button offers to suggest more of your tabs you can add to the group. That's less intrusive than Firefox Translations are by default.

Although, one thought I had is that there's nothing wrong with experimenting with non-standard interfaces as long as you still have the option to still just buy, say, a Toyota with a standard steering wheel instead of 3D Moebius Steering or whatever. The problem is when the biggest manufacturers keep forcing changes by top-down worldwide fiat, forcing customers to either grin and bear it or quit driving (or using the Web) entirely.

reply

Take mobile interfaces. When touchscreens arrived, we genuinely needed new patterns. A mouse pointer paradigm on a 3.5"" screen with fat fingers simply doesn't work. Swipe gestures, pull-down menus, bottom navigation—these emerged because the constraints demanded it, not because someone thought ""wouldn't it be novel if...""The problem now is that innovation has become cargo-culted. Companies innovate because they think they should, not because they've identified a genuine problem. Every app wants its own navigation paradigm, its own gesture language, its own idea of where the back button lives. That's not innovation, that's just noise.However, I'd have to push back on the car analogy: steering wheels were an innovation over tillers, and a crucial one. Tillers gave you poor mechanical advantage and required constant two-handed attention. The steering wheel solved real problems: better control, one-handed operation, more space for passengers. It succeeded because it was genuinely better, and then it standardised because there was no reason to keep experimenting.The web needs more of that approach: innovate when there's a genuine problem, then standardise when you've found something that works. The issue isn't innovation, it's the perverse incentive to differentiate for its own sake.

You're right that it's not going to be better designs, but paradigm shifts.We still don't know what it means to provide input to a mostly self-driving car. It hasn't been solved and people continue to complain about attention fatigue and anxiety. Is the driving position really optimal for that? Are accident fatalities reduced if the driver is sitting somewhere else? Even lane assist still sucks on traditionally designed cars. Is having to fight a motorized wheel to override steering really all that safe?Light switches may be reliable and never go away, but we have many well-established everyday examples of automatic lights: door switches, motion sensing, proximity sensing, etc. You never think about it and that's the point.

I'm not saying your hopes are bad, exactly. I'm interested in what such workflows might look like. Maybe there _is_ a good UX for a web shopping assistant.

There's a similar amateurs-do-too-much effect with typography and design. I studied typography for four semesters in college, as well as creative writing. The best lessons I learned were:In writing, show, don't tell.In typography, use the type to clarify the text - the typography itself should be transparent and only lead to greater immersion, never take the reader out of the text.Good UI follows those same principles. Good UX is the UI you don't notice.

The UX is also awful.But I think this is a compounding problem that spans generations of applications.

Why is it so fucking hard to set a picture in?And it's that kind of ossification and familiar demand that reinforces the continuum that we see, I think. And when a company does get creative and sees some breakthrough success it is constrained to nascency before it gets swallowed by conglomerate interests and strangled.And Google's alternative ecosystem has all of these parallels. It's crazy to see these monolithic companies floundering like this. That's what I don't understand.

I'm forced to use WhatsApp for a local group, and for some reason, when in the group chat, when I pull up to ensure that I see the latest message, that stupid app opens an audio-recording thingy at the bottom as if I wanted to send an audio note to the group.Who designed that? Has that person been fired?Also, I wish that on Windows ""windows"" weren't able to provide their own chrome and remove the title bar. Add some things to it yes, but fully replace it? No thank you.

I think ""yes"" and ""a bit"", in that order. The early days of the web and mobile, where everything was new, are gone. In those days, there was no established pattern for standard UX. Designers had to innovate.It makes sense that we have a lot less innovation now. There's probably room for a lot more than we see, but not for the level that was there in the early days of the web.

There's no reason to ""learn"" a UI or use shortcuts on most sites, because they change everything around every few months.I see people reminiscing about tabs in firefox, well today a majority of the top websites don't even allow you to open links in new tabs! The links aren't even real links anymore, and everything's a webapp. ( and by top websites, I mean social media, not the top sites used by the HN crowd. Sites like YT, FB, IG, and TT ).I try to interact with the ""UI"" of websites as little as possible these days. I use RSS readers for as much as possible. Any time I get a popup on any site, I get mad. I don't care about news updates, software updates, or offers. Anything that pops up at me, or moves around before I can click it, looks like a scam to me. Even if it's ""legitimate"". The modern web feels like an arcade game that's trying to waste my time.

To an extent, yes. The ecosystem has matured. The things that work have been discovered, the things that don't have been discarded.I think it'll take another big leap in hardware form factor (Apple Vision being an example of an attempt at it) for us to see meaningful UI changes.

Browsers could start by simply improving the controls they do ship with, such has date pickers and selects. They're all shit. Slightly more complex perhaps would be a combobox. LMAO, we don't even have comboboxes.And if you really want to get fancy, rich-text textareas that return standardized, semantic HTML. Also, decent tables with sorting/filtering wouldn't go amiss.Standardize some HTMX features into HTML while you're at it, you've got a full-blown revolution.

There is more than enough of it. Now it is, of course, AI agents. Before that, Material Design was quite innovative. Interestingly, with the raise of search engines and later LLMs, we are getting back to the command line! It is not the scary black window where you type magic incantations, it is a less scary text field where you type in natural language, but fundamentally, it works like a command line.It is a good thing? For me, it is a mixed bag, I miss traditional desktop UIs (pre-Windows 8), but I like search-based UIs on the Desktop, an I am not a fan of AI agents: too slow an unpredictable, and that's before privacy considerations. When it is not killing performance, I find Material Design to be pretty good on mobile, but terrible on the desktop. That there is innovation doesn't mean it is all good.

In some ways, this is happening at the moment with AI and LLMs. The tools available, how we prompt them, etc are all ""UI/UX innovation"" if you believe these things have a use.If we have a huge platform shift in the future (LLMs, AR/VR, ???), we may start from zero and go through ""inventing tabs"" again until that platform becomes maximally optimised.

Yes. When coming from DOS, all the UI/UX that could have been created has been created. What we have now is a loop of tries to refresh the existing but it's hard, mainly because it's now everywhere and it has reached maturity.As an example, the ""X"" to close and the left arrow for back won't be replaced before a long time, just like we still have a floppy to represent save.Cars have tried to refresh their ui/UX but they failed and are now reverting back to knobs and buttons.It seems that VisionOS is a place where innovation could come but it's not really a success.

Designers decided that scrollbars that shrink to super-thin columns when not in use were better. Maybe... but often it results in shrunken scrollbars that require extra work to accurately hover over and expand.Designers decided that gray text on gray backgrounds were easier to read, and there was even a study to ""prove"" it... which resulted in idiots picking poor contrast choices of gray-on-gray, without understanding the limits on this idea.I will say that the current push for accessibility is forcing some of these ""innovations"" back onto the junk heap where they belong. I was annoyed the first time an accessibility review complained about the contrast of my color choices on a form once... but once I got over my ego, I have to admit they were right; the higher-contrast colors are easier to read.

No. You just need to look outside of desktop computing, and computing in general.For example, I'm getting into CAD and 3d printing. Learning it reminds me of when my father learned to program in the late '80s, or when my grandfather telling me about how he got his Model A up to 50 mph.Remember: Desktop computers and the web are ultimately tools for a purpose, and that purpose isn't always ""nerd toy."" We (the nerds) need to find and invent our toys every generation or so.

Apple has the unfortunate burden of needing to shepherd millions of developers over to this new paradigm (AR) before it really exists, and so is shoving Liquid Glass onto devices that don't really benefit from it.But in practice people are generally not happy about lots of new experimentation going on. By definition, most of the results suck. In retrospect we get to stand in awe of those that survived the evolutionary battle and say ""wow browser tabs"" and ""wow pull to refresh"" and forget the millions of other bad ideas that we tried.

There doesn't seem to be any way to set per-user group policies, so unless you're installing firefox in a user-controlled directory, it will require elevated privileges.[1]: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customizing-firefox-usi...

I'm not certain, but I'd probably be willing to bet this isn't the full story.

> Despite political independence, the United States remained dependent on imports for manufactured goods. The conflicts between the European Powers and the Embargo of 1807 severely disrupted trade between the United States, Great Britain, France and Asia. Lowell reached the conclusion that to be truly independent, the United States needed to manufacture goods at home. In June 1810, he went on a two-year visit with his family to Britain.  ... Lowell developed an interest in the textile industries of Lancashire and Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving machines, which were operated by water power or steam power. He was not able to buy drawings or a model of a power loom. He secretly studied the machines. In Edinburgh he met fellow American Nathan Appleton who would later become a partner in the Lowell mills. As the War of 1812 began, Lowell and his family left Europe and on their way home, the boat and all their personal belongings were searched at the Halifax port to ensure that no contraband was being smuggled out of Great Britain. Lowell had memorized all the workings of British power looms without writing anything down.Or Samuel Slater - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Slater> Samuel Slater (June 9, 1768 – April 21, 1835) was an early English-American industrialist known as the ""Father of the American Industrial Revolution"", a phrase coined by Andrew Jackson, and the ""Father of the American Factory System"".

1) Workforce is 20-60yos, conservatively ~600m (more with retirement reforms) in 2045, roughly 2-3x US workforce with disproportionate STEM bias. If current tertiary trend keeps up, that's 6-8x US STEM workforce backed by RoW combined in automation synergy, which will slowly decline over decades, and since white collar they can hang around much longer past retirement unlike blue collar. Now the 2045 demo pyramid is not favourable for 2065 talent generation and if no fix, trend towards disastrous by 2080s, but in terms of actual absolute high skill workforce advantage vs competitors, it's almost unassimilable amount combined with industrial density for like 50 years. That's within the timeframe of building hegemons.2) For 2045s 65-85s - they are overwhelmingly old/poor (undereducated, left behind by modernisation). They ""weigh"" SUBSTANTILLY economically less than their actual headcount. The bottom 2 quantiles of PRC constitutes <10% of GDP, each skilled young-rich workforce making just median income replaces ~6 low productively elderly. People fixate on the 4:2:1 dependency ratios as if each generation is weighted the same like in advanced economies - they're not - PRC's income disparity is huge buffer against dependency ratio. Those 65-85s are tail gen of worth ""less"" cohorts who will also die magnitude richer than any generation before them. This also not considering PRC has 90%+ home ownership rate, some of the highest savings in the world, i.e. the 4:2 generation is brought up to depend on themselves. This is a very different cohort to caretake for - PRC is not advanced economy demo composition, where paycheck to paycheck new gen are increasingly less rich/young than previous gen but still has to prop up onerous social welfare net for rich/old. PRC is unequal society where new gen massively more productive than old gen, has high savings culture, many geographic income disparities to arbitrage COL, and high home ownership, i.e. you can throw all the elderly in a nicer tier4 city where COL is peanuts. People don't realize PRC old before rich is a FUCKING BLESSING, i.e. they're not even JP/SKR where old is now rich and a high burden, where they tapped out on skilled workers as % of workforce with lower home ownership and savings rate, and uniform geographic economy means they can't dump old in substantially cheaper COL regions.Finally flip side of 4:2:1 ratio, where the 4:2 has high savings + property) is once older generation starts to croak = multiple wealth transfers to younger gen (at least in terms of property). If extrapolated (this is speculative but mechanically likely) much of current PRC TFR issues is combination of excess competition and delayed family formation due to absolutely brrting tertiary in compressed period where talent:job supply:demand are mismatched. Current cohorts are growing up in fucked period where 20m new grads were competing for 15m jobs, vs near future where 10m new grads are pick and choosing from 15m+ jobs. By 2030s, aka when most current skilled cohorts are established it's going to be MUCH easier justify having kids, because projected involution pressure will be gone, no need to be top 1% of gaokao etc, unless AGI and crazy automation because their kids will be guaranteed to enter society with stupid amount of job vacancies / opportunities, and likely multiple properties. Like the natural outcome of current demo structure is most PRC new gen will have roof over head, not live paycheck to paycheck, and once cost of competitive child rearing goes, because every child guaranteed job, all current factors stalling family formation disappears.

The U.S. is driven far more by ideology, and the trans stuff is an example of that.And someone on the other side of the aisle would point to the prosecution of Donald Trump as politically motivated, where opponents found an obscure law that he violated and charged him with 34 counts based on the 34 forms he submitted with the expense mislabelling.

I'm guessing you never lived and worked in China before? People who get jobs because of guanxi are not rare, even today, and ideology is far more important in China than in the US, it is just that the ideology is very different from what people are used to in the states.

Hobbesian self-interest refers to the idea that human actions are primarily motivated by the desire for personal gain or advantage. This concept is central to Thomas Hobbes' political philosophy, where he argues that without a strong governing authority, individuals would act solely out of self-interest, leading to a chaotic and violent state of nature.

The problems with the USA political system are: electoral college, senate being 2 votes per state, and the supreme court being 7 people for life.  But nothing can be done about the last two now.  Especially now that the Supreme Court made a decision limiting how amendments can be ratified.

Every branch of the federal government has experienced a decline in democratic accountability.The House is so gerrymandered that only 10% of seats are remotely competitive each year, and it hasn't kept up with population growth.The Senate is permanently gerrymandered, with state population differences that are far more disproportionate than what was originally designed for and intended when the Constitution was written.This combined with hyper-partisanship prevents the US from accepting new states like Washington DC (population 700,000+) and Puerto Rico (population 3.2 million), depriving millions of US citizens from Congressional representation (no, non-voting representatives don't count).The Supreme Court has become hyperpartisan, and appointments are a high stake circus that rely on arbitrary retirements and deaths. They need to be elected at this point to preserve democratic legitimacy.As for the Presidency... the Electoral College has resulted in the election of the loser of a popular vote twice in 25 years.I don't know how reform will happen, or if we'll ever see it in my lifetime but we desperately need it.  The US government needs to be accountable to the people again.Democracy is precious, and it's so tragic to see how much it's declined.

States with a total of 270 electoral votes agree to award their electors to the winner of the national popular vote.  The effort appears to be stalled, but there are 209 votes from states who've already passed the law (which is in effect only once 270+ electoral votes are reached).The Supreme Court's composition can be changed with a law, and the most popular option appears to be 18 year terms, staggered so that there are two appointments for each presidential term.  The court can also be expanded, and should be to 13 (one for each circuit).Gerrymandering is a serious problem, and would properly be solved by coming up with some algorithmic way of drawing districts.  But for practical purposes this unlikely to ever happen.  But I'm hopeful because of the effort of Democratic states to recognize the gerrymandering and turning it into a standoff of sorts.  To date, there's been no reason not to gerrymander if you can do it, and Republicans have seriously overreached.

Is it? Many western countries are having more or less prominent populist right wing movements, and the two countries I can think of where that movement has gotten its hand in power on really significant issues during the last decade or so are UK and US. Both strongly two party systems at the time of the ""interesting"" developments. And I do not think a two party system is typical, I am sure there are some countries happily trodding along with their two political parties, but they are not the rule.

No, its not, as anyone who has paid even a slight amount of attention to the study of comparative government among modern nominal representative democracies would recognize.> We have to be honest about the fact that parliamentary systems can give massive power to a tiny fraction of the population when that small party becomes the deciding vote.Parliamentary systems can be two-party and multiparty systems do not need to parliamentary, so you are starting with a false dichotomy. And the problem you describe is less often a problem with multiparty systems (parliamentary or otherwise) than two-party systems, because the reliance on ad hoc coalitions means that there is much more likely to be the option of replacing a faction that is leveraging its marginal role in creating a majority to wag a coalition that is a small part of, whereas a small faction within a major party in a two party system that is crucial to maintaining a partisan majority cannot practically be defied without the rest of the party surrendering its majority, giving it much more power than a minor coalition partner in a multiparty system.(Parliamentary or semi-presidential systems are also generally better than presidential systems, but that's a whole different issue from the multiparty vs. two-party issue.)> The problems with the USA political system are: electoral college, senate being 2 votes per state, and the supreme court being 7 people for life.The first two of those are also problems (though actually being a Presidential system is a bigger problem, and a problem without which the electoral college would be moot.) The third is simply inaccurate.> But nothing can be done about the last two now.

If Congress wanted to make Supreme Court justices appointed for a fixed term of years from among the set of lifetime federal judges, that would be possible. If Congress kept lifetime tenure for justices, decided to have one appointed every 2 years regardless of the current size of the court, and have the Chief Justice appointed for 4 year terms from among the sitting justices, that would work too.)

The American two-party system gave massive power to a tiny fraction of the population, which the large Republican party then retconned into most of their members as their party platform. Now they're a large fraction of the population. I'd choose the approach where the small faction remains its own small faction, even if they occasionally get to pull the levers of power.

Honestly a bit disgusted to have even read what you wrote here. Shameful.Edit for more substance: your use of homicide numbers belies the common racist American stereotype of blacks as not only a violent, but coddled minority. The fact that your mind would even begin to think that it's fair to compare 2 million incarcerated black people to the 3-5% of people who are incarcerated for murder for a statistical gotcha is despicable.

America still wants to play hegemon, but since Bretton Woods 2.0 didn't happen, they're going to lock up the entire North and South American continents from Chinese and Russian influence. And it'll be fierce.The next salvo is going to be US statehood for Alberta and Saskatchewan. There is already partisan support within those provinces, and Trump is going to offer money to push it. If that happens, Yukon and the Northwest Territories are next.(Side note: these are Republican voters, which gives Republicans the Senate for years to come.)Venezuela wasn't about drugs or oil, it was about China. And it wasn't Trump's thing, it was the career DoD folks. (Venezuela is within medium-range missile range of 50% of US oil refineries. The US doesn't want foreign basing there or in Cuba.)The DoD is pushing Greenland too as it'll be a centerpiece of Arctic shipping in the coming century. And Cuba, as it's both extremely close to CONUS and a choke point for the gulf.You can see the plays happening if you watch.

The Albertan separatism thing is largely drummed-up due to American aggression towards Canada, it slots right into the news cycle alongside threats of annexation that Canada was getting not that long ago. That being said, even in a province as conservative as Alberta, it remains a fringe view, even though some politicians are now willing to say the quiet part out loud. Consider how hard Quebec had tried to secede on multiple occasions, and yet despite having a far stronger case and far more supporters, still failed every time. Talking about Saskatchewan is just trying to lump them in with the Albertans, where in reality that group is even more niche.But then talking about Yukon and the Northwest Territories just makes this look like enthusiastic map-painting. The reality is, both of these places are overwhelmingly indigenous, and they'd have no reason to ever want to not be part of Canada. Also, they're both territories, which in many ways means they're ruled directly by the federal government, a.k.a. you won't be getting those short of a military invasion or completely ruining the rest of the country to the point where they can just cut it all up.

My understanding is that US is going to shrink back a bit, takes care of its neighbours first, but keep its probing bases intact, so that it can slash some costs and be more flexible in next decades. China is going to reluctantly expand its power base gradually -- but I think it's going to be a slow expansion because any rapid one would either fail, or create a new power group within China, that may threaten the existing players.Not sure about EU though, it better gear up quickly.

Disagree.1. If any Canadian province becomes an American state (with electoral votes), the Republicans won't win an election for the next 100 years. Even if it's Alberta.2. Alberta likely won't secede unless they get full statehood. Nobody wants to be another Puerto Rico.3. I think if you did a referendum in Alberta today (even with full US statehood on offer), the votes to secede would number over 10%.Remember, Quebec in 1995: 50.58% voted to stay, with a turnout of 93.52%. And they were all but ready to leave to the point of engaging in IRA-style terrorism.Also, the famous failure of Brexit all but precludes any such referendums from getting serious wind in our lifetimes.

Greenland is happening, and will be underway soon.  It's just a matter of how much international support it will have initially, and how the USA will strong arm support.Canada is on the back burner after the realization that a country with a leader who was the Governor of the national banks of two major countries might know a thing or two about economic warfare.

That's where i think France have dropped the ball with its last presidents. Any pre-2007 president would have already declared Greenland as ""EU, thus France sovereign interest"" and reiterated French nuclear doctrine since 1964 (One warning shot, then tactical nukes, aiming for the army/supply and not civilian infrastructure). Macron will never do that, because if you say it, you have to follow up.

Other priorities.Plus, they need to arrange some international support to ensure that enough countries recognize the transition.  That takes time to put into place both the  carrots (weapons for Middle Easterners) and sticks (tariffs for Europeans).Once this happens, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and maybe Egypt, Japan, SK, will recognize the transition as official.

If I asked you 2 months ago 'do you think Trump will steal tankers of Venezuelan oil using the US military, sell the oil, and deposit the funds in accounts setup offshore in the middle eastern country that gave him a free jumbo jet?' would you have said 'there is no way that will happen'?I'm sick of the 'it's just Trump being Trump' when no one would treat any other politician that way. No, it is the US President, who sent an official US delegation, which, when it left (after reducing Greenlands official delegation to tears) continued to say 'we are taking Greenland'. Fuck off with 'it's just Trump being Trump'. It is the United States President.

Meaning to or not you are running defense for it, as news coverage/sane people have done continuously for Trump with the 'it's just Trump being Trump'. Don't do that. Don't let them do that. This is the United State President sending an OFFICIAL delegation. It IS ALREADY OFFICIAL POLICY, we sent an OFFICIAL United States delegation that had official talks with Greenland's OFFICIALS. That is not just memes so I don't know how you accept people telling you it is. That is OFFICIAL UNITED STATES POLICY. Again, OFFICIAL DELEGATIONS meeting with FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT MEMEs. That half the country says they are means zero. It is in part how they empower Trump to get away with what they want.That you accept 'official US policy that American diplomats are actively engaged in, right now, is just memes' is wild to me.

So Canada is already fractured.  And there's a strong chance Québécois offer support of Alberta and Sas succession.  Perhaps there will be some reciprocity and all three provinces leave Canada at the same time.Which leaves western Canada in a bit of a pickle.[0] https://ca.news.yahoo.com/first-reading-quebec-little-notice...

There are some cultural factors in Alberta which draw it closer to the US than to Ontario and Quebec.  Libertarianism, pro-fossil fuels, differences wrt firearms, differences in attitudes to crime and punishment, etc...  The perception is that previous compromises around these items are slowly frayed to appease voting blocks in other provinces (mostly Quebec).Then, the dirty reality; the Canadian economy has never been ""great"", at least in my lifetime.  Nearly my whole class at university wound up going to the US, because one couldn't get a decent paying job in Canada in a lot of fields.  Even our current prime minister did a ton of his work abroad.  If separating (IE: joining the US) was only an economic question, only a tiny elite would support remaining a part of Canada.The question Alberta separatists wish to ask is much less dishonest than the Quebec separation question in 95, which leads me to believe they are much more confident about their success.  I wouldn't rule it out.

That said I do grudgingly admire Lesvesque and felt he was much better than all of his successors.  You could tell he had a philosophy of a Quebec that could be an actual nation, not merely a collection of childless people who spoke French and simply emulated France.There is no Lesvesque in Alberta and that is why Alberta will never be a nation; only a gas station for the US.  Still, if the only thing people value is income maybe that's the better outcome.

As someone who's worked in the auto industry (in Canada) I have to 'hard disagree.' The big three have proven time and time again that we (Canadians) are second-class citizens when it comes to how they operate the facilities built here. Even before any of this nonsensical tariff nonsense, billions in government money has been given to the likes of Stellantis and GM over the years in an effort to keep jobs in Canada, with them putting in the bare-minimum effort to satisfy people in the short-term and thanking us by continuing their movement of production out of the country. Instead of trying to talk the president down from his pointlessly harmful tariffs, or doing what Toyota/Honda have done in pivoting to building worldwide models beside the domestic ones, the big three are gleefully taking the opportunity to expedite the closure or downsizing of facilities here.Outside of the chuds who 'need' a pickup truck to satisfy their fragile ego, sales of ""American"" vehicles are starting to drop, with buyers choosing domestically-produced where possible (like the Toyota Rav4, Lexus NX/RX, or Honda Civic/CR-V).[0][0]: https://ca.investing.com/news/economy-news/market-share-of-u...

This is patently false.

And, to be clear, that does not mean you need to get rid of union US labor. It just means the existing folks can do more with the same number of folks they have today, and the pipeline for new workers can shrink while maintaining productivity (and we're going to need those folks for other jobs automation cannot do; trades, electrical grid and renewables infra, nursing and care, etc).

On a huge number of products in the US there is little to no US competition. Instead of using product means (build it better) they use capital means (use your size to get loans to buy up anyone that looks like they could compete in the future).Lots of US companies minimize actual competition via civil contracts. Cola companies are a great domestic example of this. You give them all the space they want and crowd out competition or you get 'standard pricing', which is way more.A sizeable portion of the large US companies moved away from making products to printing money via becoming a financial institution. Car companies are a notorious example.Simply put making products is a side gig, rent seeking is the primary goal. Until we kill that off, we're in for a worsening level of hurt.

The thing about China is that they're more strategic with their money and have longer timelines and clear, achievable visions. If you read the Wikipedia page for Made in China 2025 you'll get the wrong impression that their success is due to more recent pushes; the vision is far more universal and has existed for far longer. You don't get to the forefront of advanced manufacturing from nothing in ten years. Look at the 5th and 6th Five-Year Plans, into the seventh… you see the groundwork laid for present day China. The US rarely does that sort of long term thinking or planning these days, and it's not even about the political winds changing or short-termism as much as that we lack one unified vision. Without that unified vision you can't plan long term and you also can't correct glaring problems. For example, if we had a unified vision on manufacturing, an obvious issue would be the lack of an American JLCPCB. You could create one with a stick and carrot approach, tariff assembled PCBs, new rule that any imported assembled PCB has to prominently display “electronics made in China”, smart subsidies for US board houses that encourage scaling and cost reduction. But that level of cohesion and vision rarely happens in the US and so we get a chaotic hodgepodge.

China has gone all-in on EVs because over the years they smartly built up the world's best rare earth refining capabilities and immense manufacturing prowess while the United States has undoubtedly secured the global oil supply (remember tanks and fighter jets to fight wars aren't running on batteries) which, even amongst the doomiest of doomers will last quite a while.China was never going to be an oil-producing powerhouse, but it did have the ability to leverage alternative energy sources so that it wasn't quite as beholden to the petrodollar institution, so that is what they did. And of course running cars on batteries and doing so at a very cheap cost makes sense there.Meanwhile, the US can obviously produce good cars at a good enough price and with cheap oil for the foreseeable future it's hard to argue in favor of EVs as a national policy. What, we're going to switch to EVs? Who is going to build them? Tesla? We don't have access to the rare earth refining capabilities to meet demand. It's just physics. And if China is using less oil, that means more for the United States and others.As you said, China has taken these actions out of self interest, but the self interest isn't ""clean environment"" or anything like that, it's just down to being not as reliant on the US for energy. Though that's a nice benefit. I do own an EV and I think the driving experience is superior but geopolitically things seem to be trending in a different direction.

This is false. The US has chosen to produce expensive (average new vehicle price is $50k), fossil combustion vehicles to the detriment of its population. I want a cheap EV. I will buy a cheap EV from a US automaker. They do not want to sell cheap EVs. The US won't allow me to buy excellent, cheap Chinese EVs. The US population is being held economically hostage for legacy automaker profits and the fossil fuel industry. Why should the US consumer collectively have to pay more for these low quality decisions? I am incentivized to root for the destruction of US legacy auto so that I can eventually get a high quality, inexpensive Chinese EV, because that will be all who is left building them. China sells more EVs than the US sells entirely.

It's not false. See Honda, Toyota, &c. many models are made in the US by Americans even if they're Japanese companies.> The US has chosen to produce expensive (average new vehicle price is $50k), fossil combustion vehicles to the detriment of its population.The US industry regardless of reason isn't going to be able to make a cheap, high-quality EV because it doesn't have access to affordable refining capabilities due to various reasons. So the actual situation is, sure the US could let China ship in a bunch of awesome EVs, but then the US automakers will suffer and some will go out of business and then the US just won't be making cars and those union autoworker jobs will be gone. Some people are fine with that I guess, but strategically it doesn't make a lot of sense for the US to allow the domestic auto industry to be crushed. Same thing with Germany. The EU is already starting to roll back EV mandates [1] for the same reason the US is focusing back on oil and natural gas.> Whatever it takes to get cheap EVs with the sharpest deployment trajectory possible, I am not particular, regardless of the harm it incurs on US automakers or the US itselfOn the other hand, as an American voter and even an EV driver, I disagree with these actions. EVs at all cost isn't a goal that makes sense or that I'm interested in. A better argument is to just do away with cars entirely.

Well, you're arguing this in the wrong country. You might check your priors. I regret to inform you that only about 5% of Americans use public transit [1] [2] [3], and that is unlikely to change unless there is a sea change of migration towards urban areas from the suburbs and rural areas.A majority of US miles are driven in rural areas or areas without mass transit [4], and the sun belt, where there is limited to no public transit, holds roughly half of the US population. I certainly agree to destroy demand for light vehicle passenger miles in urban areas with robust public transit and other non vehicle options, but the rest of the US will require EVs of some sort. Most of the US does not have mass transit infrastructure, and won't for the remainder of most of our lives (as of this comment).[1] https://vividmaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/public-tran...[2] https://vividmaps.com/public-transportation-in-the-united-st...[3] https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/public-t...[4] https://www.bts.gov/geography/geospatial-2/daily-vehicle-mil...

Yes… I'm aware. I'm arguing for change in that figure. Part of the reason American cars are so expensive is because as an industry manufacturers can raise prices because there are no alternatives to car ownership.The US won't require EVs for any purpose anytime in our lives. We don't have the processing and manufacturing capacity to build them here, and we won't allow our auto industry to go defunct either. It'll be gasoline for the foreseeable future. Not necessarily a future I like as an EV owner but that's how things look today. Winning a war is more important than the climate, unfortunately.

(if you look at a random sampling of 100 cars, 5 will be from this year, 5 from 2025, and so on until you've counted the 5 cars from 2005 ; the average age will be 10.5 years)If you assume that there are more cars sold every year (due to demographics: way more humans are alive today than in 2005), then this is consistent with a useful lifespan of 25 years or more per car since the ""10.5"" average is skewed younger because of the age pyramid bias.

Market distortions favoring heavy trucks include:* The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE), enacted in Congress in 1975 under the Ford administration in reaction to the Arab oil embargo, with its tiered structure on passenger vehicles vs. trucks.* The ""Chicken Tax"", tariffs on light trucks enacted by Lyndon Johnson as a reaction to French / West German tariffs on chickens. While much of this trade war was repealed, the light truck tariff never was.* Section 179 tax deductions, which are biased in favor of heavy vehicles. As I understand it, this particular deduction was inserted into the tax code via the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 under Reagan, for the purpose of aiding small businesses that might rely on such.So it's been, from my perspective, a fairly non-partisan desire from all of US politics, with protectionism as perhaps part of the goal, but perhaps due to other goals that had unintended effects.Personally, I think that government regulations can only explain so much. Even with the market distortions, trucks tend to be rather expensive compared to smaller vehicles sedans, and that's before factoring in the bad gas mileage. My presumption is that America's vastly more rural landscape contributes just as much to the preference for trucks as government policy.I do surmise from articles, though, that the above US policies have impacted the ability for lighter pickup trucks to entering the market. I suspect that some smaller pickups, like the small ""kei trucks"" that seem to have a bit of a following in the US even with all the regulatory hassle, would be much more present if a lot of these protections were removed.

The US has exploited Canada for decades. Sometimes it's been somewhat beneficial for some part of the Canadian working class. Other times not.China will do the same. Just from a further distance.Americans who like to convince themselves that the US has been doing charity work for us are delusional. They've benefited from discounted resources and cheap labour.Now China will benefit from that instead, and the US will look internally for cheap labour of its own. American workers who think they'll get a good deal out of cutting Canada out of the equation... again, delusional. Their necks are first on the chopping block. First through paying more at the cash register because of tariffs, and next because the Trump admin will be coming after their salaries next.

They mostly threaten western dominance economically.IMO, Canada should just do what's best for its citizen, which is get good trade deals, and ensure that our values don't morph into something unrecognizable.

China has at least 2 key advantages in manufacturing -- cheaper labor and laxer regulations. If the US were to embrace and extend robotics and automation more vigorously that first point could become moot. Also the second point as far as labor regulations go, and if environmental regulations were properly priced then that too would be moot.

2. Manufacturing as % of the population has long been declining globally including China. Labor cost is a very minor expense in modern manufacturing unless we talking something like clothing.

I'll quote you the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook himself on that topic:The number one reason why we like to be in China is the people. China has moved into very advanced manufacturing, so you find in China the intersection of craftsman kind of skill, and sophisticated robotics and the computer science world. That intersection, which is very rare to find anywhere, that kind of skill, is very important to our business because of the precision and quality level that we like. China has extraordinary skills. In the US, you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I'm not sure we could fill the room. In China, you could fill multiple football fields. Hence, the vocational expertise in China is very deep.FWIW a cousin of mine, Italian, founded a 3D printers startup a decade ago and according to him there was no place in the world with the level of expertise and skills to create a complex machine manufacturing startup like Guanzhou or Shenzen. It's not just the skills they have when it comes to manufacturing, it's the entire ecosystem: logistics, bureaucracy, suppliers, energy, materials, engineering. China has all of those.He was even featured on the first Italian national channel:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7j5WOsadkII can guarantee you that cheap labor was really a non-factor in such a choice, because there was no cheap labor in the first place.

But the ecosystem (like all ecosystems) evolves as all the entities within it evolve. Originally it was cheap labor. I think the key difference is that each entity in the US is independent and self-focused on quarterly earnings (as the C-Suite is rewarded by that and they call the shots), whereas China thinks holistically as far as how the nation moves ahead as a whole.tl;dr our priorities have been reversed -- profit vs people vs vice versa.https://itimanufacturing.com/manufacturing-move-china/

This is these companies own fault. These companies have grown cozy rent seeking with little competition and have completely missed the electrification of cars as a result. Cheaper cars will hurt those workers, but all of society will be better off when one of their largest expenses decreases.

There are a couple of exceptions to the above -- DJI and Anker are two companies I do trust -- but those are companies who have had a very strong focus on Western markets for years now, which forces them into a whole different level of QA. And they make much simpler products than EVs. Xiaomi _could_ potentially a trusted EV brand, they've been around a long time, tried to be the ""Apple of China"" and certainly came closer than other brands, but while I'd buy a phone from them I wouldn't buy a car from them.

reply

Chinese brands 20 years ago (my first stint living in China was in 2002) were like Japanese brands 40-50 years ago. And now they are where Japanese brands were 20-30 years ago. Some of them are becoming serious competitors: robo-vacs, 3D printers, drones, heatpumps, cars...many of those categories they are basically the only players ATM.Cars are an important point: a $10k BYD is basically a $10k car and nice enough for what you paid for. The higher end options seem ok as well, and are on par with what you would get in the US. You buy an EV for $60k in China, you'll get a bit less than what you get in the US due to higher luxury taxes, but not that much less (definitely not like it used to be where a nice car would cost $100k+).

The actual reality, which people like your asset inspection firm are dealing with, is the Chinese have leapfrogged the west in so many important respects, but to preserve security we have to live in an expensive technological backwater since the leaders of our society are so resistant to internal disruptive competition that may result in other people displacing them.

The EX30 currently starts at about $54,000, so... maybe not.

Actually move to somewhere across the border and live in Canada. As a US citizen living in Canada crossing into the US for visits, even fairly long ones, has little or no hassle and you can bring your Canadian car.For example if you are in Detroit, move to Windsor, Ontario. Outside of peak congestion times it is 10-20 minutes to get to or from Detroit. That's quick enough that this could work out even if you do almost all of your activities outside of your home in Detroit.BTW, there are also cities on the south border of the US where this works (with Mexico, not Canada!), but in many of those the cities on the Mexican side have somewhat of a crime problem so you would have to be a lot more cautious in picking a place to live there.

Vehicles imported under this provision that do not conform to U.S. safety and emission standards must be exported within one year and may not be sold in the U.S. There is no exemption or extension of the export requirements.There's certainly a question of if it's personal use if your canadian friend leaves their vehicle at your place and you drive it around.

Musk and crew know how to make cheap stuff - they've chosen high margin for Tesla however.

reply

TBH, Tesla is in a tough position with their EVs in NA. They can't really build a cheap enough crossover/suv to compete directly with ICE RAV4, and virtually anything they do at >$50k would negatively impact their existing product sales. The base Model 3/Y are too expensive compared to ICE and have met tepid reviews because of their slightly odd mix of price and features.So they've chosen instead to focus on autonomy and car hiring. I can't blame them for that. There's a huge potential for recurring revenue in that space and they've been positioning themselves to be in an excellent position to capture a lot of it over the next five years.

reply

Doesn't the Model Y start at 40K?  That's more expensive than the base model RAV4, but the Tesla is probably aimed at a slightly different market segment too.  My guess is they could compete head-to-head on price if they needed to, but they don't think the math works out better that direction yet.

How about Ontario builds Japanese and Chinese cars, turns CAMI and others into a Roshel or other military vehicle plant, and says good riddance to the American auto makers that have been rug-pulling long before Trump got into politics.- A great opportunity to start improving trade lines for Canola. Possibly a trial balloon for other primary and secondary resources?- Canada cannot stand on its own geopolitically. We must be closely tied to a major power. Intuitively that choice is the EU But I fear that China can move much faster and we'll find ourselves de-facto in their sphere while the EU is still debating this and that.

That vulnerability existed before and will outlast the current US government.

Oh, come on. ICE may be behaving badly right now, and you might be mad at them, but that's not an excuse for flights of fancy. Stay grounded in the truth. ICE is not ""personal police designed for oppression,"" they're police designed to enforce immigration and customs laws (ICE literally stands for ""immigration and customs enforcement"").Canada and every other country has some kind of police force that serves those roles: for instance: https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/security-securite/rem-ren-eng.ht...:> The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) removals program contributes to upholding the integrity of Canada's immigration system by removing people who are inadmissible to enter or stay in Canada.> ... The CBSA also prioritizes the removal of failed refugee claimants who entered Canada irregularly between points of entry. These cases are prioritized due to their significant impact on program integrity and on Canada's asylum system.I'm under the impression that Canada has historically actually been much more strict with enforcing immigration laws and deporting people than the US had been.

Do you know what the word ""designed"" means? Because I don't think it means what you think it means.I am in no way saying what that ICE agent did was right.

What's happening here is the ICE agents' behavior is out of control and they're probably behaving illegally.

China is a big market, and speaking of trust, China has not threatened us with annexation. Words matter, as do deeds.Culture is important, but has relatively little to do with geopolitics.

It isn't absolutely everything, it's for negligence. If you don't have basics in place, like independent pen-tests, ISO 27001 audits — or some equivalent — when you're handling clinical data, then that's negligence.If a breach happens and you were seen to have followed best practice, you won't be found criminally negligent.That is part of being an executive. The buck stops with you — if you're an executive, you'd better understand your obligations, you get the big bucks for a reason, it isn't just a fancy job title.Other people in the organisation can be held accountable for criminal acts, but when it comes to criminal negligence, it's the executives that are liable, because it's a systemic failure and you're deemed to be in-charge of the system.

There is no European country which does a worse job at both of these. Germany is easily the number one country in the world for ""protocol is everything"". It doesn't matter how detrimental and damaging the rules are, the rules are the rules, and they must be followed. This case is the millionth example. The rules are interpretable as it being illegal to access data with a publically available password using this password, so we're going to apply them, despite it being patently absurd. For the first point, German's reponse to Gaza (the slowest in all of the West) said everything.

These frameworks provide structure for established patterns,but they also actually do a lot that you don't have to do anymore. If you are for example building an agentic application then these kind of frameworks make it very simple to create the workflows, do the chat with the model providers, provide structure for agentic skills, decision making and the human in the loop, etc. etc.All stuff that I would consider ""low level"". All things you don't have to build.If you have an aversion to frameworks then sure - by all means. But if you like to move faster and using good building blocks then these frameworks really help.One thing to keep in mind - many of these AI frameworks are open source and work really well without needing backend services. Or you can self host them where needed. But for many that is also the premium model, please use and pay for our backend services. But that is also a choice of course.

But those are also very trivial to build, and you end up having to customize them for your need, and if the framework don't have those levers, better be prepared to either fork the framework, or spend time contributing upstream.Or, start simple yourself with what you need, use libraries for the hairy parts you don't want to be responsible for the implementation of, then pipe these things together.

                Reading time 5 minutes
      

Elon Musk's SpaceX has emerged as the dominant force in commercial space launch services, satellite internet, and reusable rocket technology. As a privately held company, financial gains from that dominance have been limited to a small circle of institutional investors, but that's finally about to change.

In 2026, SpaceX plans to make an initial public offering that would reportedly seek to raise more than $30 billion—potentially the largest IPO in history. The company has not yet filed publicly or disclosed when the offering could take place, but the anticipation has everyone asking the same question: Should I invest?

For this Giz Asks, we asked experts to weigh in on the potential risks and rewards of investing in SpaceX. While each of them acknowledged SpaceX's technological lead, they also warned that valuation, timing, and execution risk could undermine returns for public investors.

Associate Chartered Accountant (ACA) and research analyst primarily supporting autonomous technology and robotics strategy at ARK Invest.

A lot of companies talk about going public, we've seen the IPO craze. But what makes SpaceX different is the lack of competition.

What I mean by that is SpaceX landed a booster 10 years ago and has executed almost perfectly on reusability since. The closest competitor—Blue Origin—just landed a booster a couple of months ago. So while other companies are starting to figure out partial reusability, SpaceX is full steam ahead with full reusability in its Starship program.

We think SpaceX is probably one of the most compelling private companies globally, not just in terms of launch capabilities, but also in terms of Starlink internet connectivity. They offer direct-to-cell, which provides mobile coverage in dead zones around the globe. More recently, SpaceX has shown interest in orbital data centers, which could meaningfully change the AI race.

Every investor has a different financial situation and risk tolerance. What I would strongly recommend everyone to do is educate themselves about SpaceX. Last year, ARK Invest collaborated with a company called Mach33 to put out an open-source SpaceX valuation model for that very purpose. However, our model does not include anything on orbital data centers, and that's a potential additional upside to what's out there.

SpaceX's core strengths are its 10-year advantage on the launch side and its multi-dimensional innovation platform. We think SpaceX is really a generational company that could produce foundational infrastructure for both global connectivity and AI compute over the next decade.

Director of the IPO Initiative and professor emeritus of the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business. Ritter is known as “Mr. IPO” for his work on initial public offerings, which he studies in addition to asset pricing, valuation, investment banking, and capital structure.

The vast majority of shares in IPOs are typically sold to institutional investors, with the exception of small offerings known as “penny stock” IPOs that have an offer price of less than $5 per share. SpaceX will not be a small offering. Indeed, it may be the largest in history, possibly raising $30 billion with a valuation on the company as a whole of $800 billion. A small fraction of the shares will likely be made available for individuals to purchase.

In June 2025, Elon Musk estimated that the company would have revenue of about $15.5 billion in 2025, according to Reuters. If the company does go public at a valuation of $800 billion with $15.5 billion in trailing annual revenue, it would have a price-to-sales ratio of 51.6. Historically, companies with at least $100 million in sales and a price-to-sales ratio greater than 40 have been disappointments for investors.

From 1980 to 2021, there have been only 13 companies going public in the U.S. with a price-to-sales ratio—valued at the offer price—of more than 40 with at least $100 million in inflation-adjusted annual sales. For these companies, the average stock price declined over the next three years, even while the market went up.

These IPOs have underperformed the market during their first three years by an average of 38% for investors who bought at the offer price, and by 62% for those who bought at the first closing market price.

The problem is that, to prevent the stock price from falling, the company has had to rapidly grow revenue and profits for a prolonged period of time, something that is hard to do. SpaceX might prove to be an exception, but the odds are against it.

It is likely that the stock will jump above the offer price on the first day of trading. Thus, buying shares at the offer price and then selling them quickly might generate some profits. But buying in the market is likely to lead to losing money. SpaceX might be a great company, but being a great company does not necessarily mean that the stock will be a good investment.

Director of government affairs at Quilty Space, a financial research, investment banking, and strategic advisory firm focused on the space sector.

The SpaceX IPO question boils down to timing. An IPO before Starship is operational would dump technical risk and schedule uncertainty onto public investors. An IPO after Starship is flying would let SpaceX sell execution instead of aspiration. That distinction is key because Starlink's next big growth spurt—V3 satellites and expanded direct-to-cell services—doesn't math out until Starship is launching regularly.

Then there's the long game. Elon's plans for space-based data centers extend the growth horizon further, but they are commercially unproven, capital-intensive, and unlikely to generate revenue anytime soon. It's also worth asking how much of that is about building a real business case versus reinforcing broader AI growth narratives that function as AI valuation scaffolding rather than predictable cash flow?

What I mean by that is that today's AI valuations assume compute can scale indefinitely, but the limitations here on Earth (power availability, grid hookups, water, cooling, land, permitting, etc.) are already breaking that assumption. Space-based data centers sidestep the chokepoints by moving all that infrastructure off the planet, which is why the idea of it (for someone like Elon) functions as much as a valuation backstop for an AI-driven market as a potential business line.

Either way, they are layering in another massive engineering, technical, and economic challenge on top of Starship, HLS [Human Landing System, i.e. the upcoming lunar lander], etc. This could get lost in the investor's blind spot, but it is important to consider because private capital tolerates long arcs and narrative elasticity far better than public markets, which price delivery. Musk understands that.

Any IPO would likely be timed up with SpaceX's belief that it has crossed the Rubicon—from ambition to utility-scale infrastructure—and no longer needs a story to bridge the gap. The question is whether the markets agree.

Joseph and Jacqueline Elbling Professor of Business Administration and Senior Associate Dean for Faculty Development and Research at Harvard Business School. Weinzierl is also a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. The commercialization of the space sector and its economic implications are a focus of his research.

The reality is that each of us is already substantially invested in SpaceX. Space may seem like a niche industry, but it reaches into our lives in countless ways every day, from GPS to telecommunications, from crop and climate monitoring to weather forecasting, and from scientific research to national security.

SpaceX is the dominant company in space today. In just 20 years, it went from a fledgling startup to being by far the world's leading rocket launch provider, operating more than half of all satellites in orbit, and serving as a linchpin of American national security.

Whether we own its stock directly or just benefit from the innovation and efficiency it has created, we should all hope that SpaceX (along with its competition) succeeds.

32GB of used DDR3 can be had for as little as $50-$80 on eBay


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


With DDR5 pricing increasing seemingly daily, some gamers are flocking to older platforms that support older memory types to escape the DRAM shortage, even going as far back as rebuilding old DDR3-supported platforms. RandomGaminginHD, aware of this problem, published a video benchmarking Intel's now ancient Core i7-4790K paired with 32GB of DDR3 memory, to see how a system like this would perform in 2026. Despite its age, he found the old Haswell quad-core was capable of playing several modern AAA games today at 60 FPS.

The full system included an i7-4790K overclocked to 4.6GHz, 32GB of DDR3 running at 1866 MHz, an Asus Z97 motherboard, and an RTX 2060 Super. The YouTuber claimed that he bought 32GB of DDR3 RAM for just $40 worth, which is almost a third of the price compared to what a single 4800MT/s 8GB DDR5 stick costs today.

The YouTuber ran the i7-4790K powered setup in eight modern titles: Baldur's Gate 3, Battlefield 6, Counter-Strike 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Fortnite, GTA 5 Enhanced, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and Red Dead Redemption 2. Baldur's Gate 3 ran at 57.9 FPS average, Battlefield 6 - 69.7 FPS average, Counter-Strike 2 - 117.9 FPS average, Cyberpunk 2077 - 59.8 FPS average, Fortnite - 115.2 FPS average, GTA 5 Enhanced - 69.6 FPS average, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 - 72.2 FPS average, Red Dead Redemption 2 - 72.3 FPS average. All games were benchmarked at medium settings and 1080p resolution, except for a couple of the lighter games (such as GTA V Enhanced), which were run at higher settings. DLAA was also engaged for most of the games to take advantage of the extra GPU headroom available since the 4790K was bottlenecking the 2060 Super.

RandomGamingInHD's benchmarks prove that hardware from 12 years ago can still provide a playable gaming experience, even on modern AAA games, as long as you have an adequate GPU installed. Granted, the 1% lows leave much to be desired, but lowering graphics settings further would help alleviate this problem (at least partially).

The best part is that a system like this is relatively affordable given today's memory pricing. If you want to build a system with these specs, you can find used i7-14790Ks for as little as $60-$80, and a lower-trim RTX 2060 Super 8GB for as little as $150 on eBay. Used DDR3 memory is also ridiculously cheap on eBay, with a set of four 8GB sticks (32GB total) costing around $70 - $120. Counting a Z97 motherboard, cheap SSD, case, and PSU, you likely could build a full-blown 4790K/2060 Super gaming PC from scratch for less than $600 using used parts. For perspective, that's less money than what a 64GB DDR5 dual-channel kit costs today.

A system like this might be the only way many PC gamers on a strict budget can get into the PC gaming world if they don't already own a decent system. DDR5 prices aren't expected to go down until 2028, and even then, prices aren't guaranteed to drop quickly.

One of the great things about competition among the best gaming monitors is that more product choices ensure better performance for all. It's hard to find a bad display, especially in a hot category like 27-inch QHD. These panels are the bread-and-butter tool of choice, whether you're a casual player or a professional competitor.

Most of these products come from a handful of companies, many of which begin with the letter ‘A'. But once in a while, a new player comes along. I'm checking one out here with my first review of a monitor from KTC, which stands for “Key To Combat.” It's called the H27E6, and it's a 27-inch QHD IPS panel with a 300 Hz refresh rate (320 Hz with overclock), Adaptive-Sync, HDR400, and wide gamut color. What of the value part? It costs $270. Let's take a look.

The H27E6 is well-appointed with performance tech. Resolution is QHD 2560x1440, and the native refresh rate is 300 Hz. That already puts it ahead of nearly every other monitor at a similar price. And a reliable overclock bumps the refresh rate up to 320 Hz. Adaptive-Sync is also included with faultless operation on both AMD and Nvidia platforms. HDMI 2.1 means consoles can join the VRR party too.

The color gamut is also wide. Though there are no Quantum Dots, the H27E6 covers over 101% of DCI-P3, which also puts it ahead of many other screens. I got decent accuracy from my sample after a calibration, more on that later. The picture is very dynamic too, thanks to a class-leading contrast ratio of 1,500:1. Though that isn't quite in VA or OLED territory, it is higher than nearly all the other IPS panels you can buy.

Features and styling have not been skimped on. You get the usual suite of gaming aids, including aiming points, a timer, and a frame counter. There's a three-level overdrive with a dynamic option that changes the compensation with the refresh rate. And you get MPRT backlight strobing as an alternative to G-Sync or FreeSync.

The H27E6 sets itself apart from others with white elements on the back, base, and upright, and you get a solid stand with full ergonomics. A handy joystick controls all functions, and there's LED lighting that you can control from the OSD. The only things left out here are speakers and USB ports.

For $270, the H27E6 offers a lot on paper and looks like a winner. But the proof is in the performance, so for that score, please read on.

The H27E6 arrives packed securely in crumbly foam and assembles without tools. If you'd rather use your own arm or bracket, there's a 100mm VESA mount in back, but you'll need to source your own fasteners. A small external power supply is provided along with a DisplayPort cable.

White displays always stand out, and the H27E6 manages to look different without screaming for attention. From the front, the base is the only obvious white part with a crosshatch pattern molded onto the black upright. In the back, the panel is completely white, as is the back of the stand. Inset around the mount point is more of the crosshatch texture ringed by LED lights. The KTC logo lights up as well. The only other thing in the back is the OSD joystick, which sits in the lower corner.

The stand is of decent quality with just a little wobble, but firm movements that maintain position. You get 5/20 degrees tilt and 45-degree swivel, along with a 90-degree portrait mode and a 5.1-inch height adjustment.

The input panel is under the center of the panel and includes two HDMI 2.1 and two DisplayPort 1.4 ports. G-Sync works only through DisplayPort, but FreeSync will operate over any input. The HDMIs support VRR for consoles as well. You can see a USB port in the photo, but it's just for firmware updates. There are no internal speakers, but you get a 3.5mm headphone jack.

The H27E6's OSD is text-based with a KTC logo as the only graphic. It's the first one I've seen with selectable color schemes, there are four to choose from. Pressing the joystick brings it up.

In the Display menu, you'll find the H27E6's seven picture modes. User is the default, and it makes all image controls available. Calibration options are all in the Color menu where you get four fixed color temps and five gamma presets. You can also adjust hue and saturation for all six colors and engage a low blue light mode. The user color temp has a single set of RGB sliders to dial in the white balance.

Gaming Setup has the video processing features with a FreeSync/G-Sync toggle, gaming aids, overdrive and MPRT. The aids include crosshairs (two shapes in five colors), a timer and an FPS counter. The overdrive has three fixed levels and a dynamic option. I found it worked without artifacts at the Standard setting. Dynamic showed slight ghosting, but it stayed consistent with changes in frame rate. You also get MPRT (backlight strobing) that works up to 320 Hz and retains the overdrive. However, you can't use it with Adaptive-Sync. But it is one of the better examples I've seen with only a slight phasing artifact.

The H27E6 supports HDR10 signals with an automatic switch as long as HDR is set to Auto. I saw that I could calibrate white balance in HDR mode, which is something I rarely see. More on that later. Advanced Settings also has the overclock toggle. Turn it on for 320 Hz. My sample ran reliably at that speed for the duration of the review.

My H27E6 sample needed a bit of tweaking for the best picture. Initial measurements showed that gamma was too light and the color temp was a bit blue. The warm preset was too red, so I worked the RGB sliders to make things right. Light gamma means a washed-out image, so I upped the preset to 2.4, which made a significant difference. My settings are below, and you'll notice the RGB values for HDR as well. This is one of the only monitors I've encountered that includes HDR calibration, and it too makes a positive difference.

Playing games on the H27E6 showed me quickly that KTC has gotten the formula right. The image is superb once calibrated and gaming feel is on par with any premium display I've encountered.

The picture is superb for SDR and HDR. It needs calibration to get there, but if you're reading this review, you have the information you need. It's the only monitor I've seen that leaves the RGB sliders active for HDR, so I used them to make a visible improvement in both color accuracy and perceived contrast. It doesn't have any dynamic dimming for HDR, but the IPS panel renders around 1,500:1, which is 50% better than the class average. If the H27E6 had a Mini LED backlight, it would be a giant slayer.

It also has superb video processing. Panel response is super quick and smooth at 320 Hz, which ran reliably for the entirety of my review. You can set the overclock once and forget it. My test PC, with its GeForce RTX 4090, had no trouble maintaining 320 fps at QHD resolution with Doom Eternal's detail set to max. Input lag was a non-factor as well. 180-degree turns were instantaneous, literally as fast as I could move the mouse. And it took no time for me to commit those movements to muscle memory so I could stop where I wanted. The H27E6 is a competitor's weapon for sure.

If you don't have a high-performance video card, the MPRT feature works very well, as does the overdrive. MPRT cancels out Adaptive-Sync but still lets you use the overclock to 320 Hz. It also retains the overdrive, so you can get excellent motion resolution at lower framerates. If you can keep it above 200 fps, though, stick with AS and overdrive on the Standard setting for tear-free operation.

As a 27-inch flat QHD monitor, it is ideally suited for day-to-day use, with 109 ppi pixel density and a sharp picture. The screen's anti-glare layer works as advertised without imparting any grain or artifacts. Color is vivid and bright with just the right balance. The native gamut covers 101% of DCI-P3, which makes it a little oversaturated for SDR but pleasing, nonetheless. I tried out the sRGB mode and found its gamma too light, which flattened the image. The gamma presets were grayed out, but I could calibrate grayscale in this mode, which is a standout feature. Most monitors gray out all picture options in their alternate gamut modes.

I enjoyed the H27E6's styling very much, mainly because its white accents set it apart from the sea of black displays that come across my desk. The white back, base, and stand have just enough black parts to keep it from screaming for attention while still making a nice statement. Physical details are just enough to maintain elegance without becoming gaudy. And finding a lighting feature at this price point is a rarity. The LEDs backlight a half ring and the KTC logo in back. The only things left out here are USB ports and internal speakers.

Takeaway: The H27E6 is an early-effort product with all the refinement of a seasoned model line. It combines excellent picture quality with premium video processing and mature styling. You'd never expect its price to be so low, but it truly delivers a lot for the money. With a bright and colorful picture, and addictive gameplay, it's sure to have a wide appeal.

How long can AMD put the shield up against the pricing chaos?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD has committed to keeping its Radeon products, among the best graphics cards available, affordable for everyday consumers, not just for enthusiasts with deep pockets. As graphics card prices have already spiraled out of control due to the DRAM shortage, David McAfee, Vice President and General Manager of Ryzen and Radeon, told Gizmodo that the chipmaker aims to keep the price hikes within reasonable limits.

AMD has cultivated long-term relationships with DRAM suppliers to ensure consistent memory availability for its Radeon graphics cards, McAfee explained. While the chipmaker continues collaborating with AIC partners to maintain competitive pricing, sustaining these efforts amid the ongoing shortage remains unrealistic. Pricing for Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50-series (codename Blackwell) graphics cards has already gone through the roof, so the situation presents a potential opportunity for AMD. The chipmaker could gain some market share if it can keep price increases moderate, even though RDNA 4 doesn't have an answer for Nvidia's top-end models, such as the GeForce RTX 5080 and above.

The Radeon RX 9000 series has seen price increases of 10% to 17% across the lineup. The flagship Radeon RX 9070 XT saw the largest price increase, up 17%, while the Radeon RX 9060 XT 8GB saw a more modest 10% increase. The Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB landed in the middle at 14%, since it has twice the memory capacity of the standard 8GB model.

AMD's previous-generation Radeon RX 7000 series didn't escape the price increases, either. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX now costs up to 10% more than it did three months ago, while Radeon RX 7900 XT and Radeon RX 7800 XT prices have risen by 4% and 6%, respectively. Surprisingly, the budget-oriented Radeon RX 7600 XT saw the steepest hike at 13%.

Retailers confirmed to Tom's Hardware last month that AMD had raised Radeon RX 9000-series prices by $10 per 8GB of memory, typically translating to a 3% to 5% increase depending on the model. However, the larger markups we're seeing today may reflect retailers adjusting prices to align with market conditions. Then again, our sources had indicated another price hike for Radeon RX 9000-series graphics cards is likely this month, so that could be the culprit as well.

Consumers who survived the COVID-era graphics card shortage know the best strategy is to wait it out until prices return to normal. Fortunately, that previous shortage lasted just two years. The current AI-driven crisis may last substantially longer. Some industry experts predict the NAND and DRAM shortage could persist until 2028 or even stretch to a full decade.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Researchers discover how Mycoplasma pneumoniae acquires cholesterol from human hosts","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260116/Researchers-discover-how-Mycoplasma-pneumoniae-acquires-cholesterol-from-human-hosts.aspx","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 04:46:00 GMT","



A multidisciplinary team has uncovered a key mechanism that allows the human bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae-responsible for atypical pneumonia and other respiratory infections-to obtain cholesterol and other essential lipids directly from the human body. The discovery, published in Nature Communications, was co-led by Dr. Noemí Rotllan, from the Sant Pau Research Institute (IR Sant Pau) and the Center for Biomedical Research in Diabetes and Associated Metabolic Disorders (CIBERDEM); Dr. Marina Marcos, from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB); and Dr. David Vizarraga, from the Institute of Molecular Biology of Barcelona of the Spanish National Research Council (IBMB-CSIC) and the Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG). Overall coordination was led by Dr. Joan Carles Escolà-Gil, from IR Sant Pau and CIBERDEM; Dr. Jaume Piñol, from UAB; and Dr. Ignacio Fita, from IBMB-CSIC. The study also involved collaboration from the Institute of Biotechnology and Biomedicine of the UAB (IBB-UAB), the Center for Biomedical Research in Cardiovascular Diseases (CIBERCV), and other leading institutions.

Dr. Joan Carles Escolà-Gil explains that ""the bacterium uses the P116 protein as a highly effective tool to capture cholesterol and other essential lipids from the host, a mechanism that allows it to survive and colonize tissues beyond the lung."" He adds that ""understanding this process opens new avenues to block its growth and to explore biotechnological applications based on its affinity for lipid-rich tissues.""

This discovery is particularly relevant because Mycoplasma pneumoniae is primarily known as a respiratory bacterium, yet several studies-including this one-show that it can reach other tissues in the body, especially those with a lipid-rich environment. Understanding how it achieves this extra respiratory colonization helps explain clinical manifestations outside the lung and provides clues about its potential contribution to systemic inflammatory processes.

Unlike other bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae cannot synthesize many lipids that are essential for the integrity of its membrane, including cholesterol, and therefore depends entirely on the host to survive. In this context, the new study demonstrates that the P116 protein acts as a highly efficient lipid uptake system, capable of extracting cholesterol and other lipid species from both human lipoproteins-including LDL and HDL-and different cell types.

Experiments conducted by the team show that P116 rapidly incorporates cholesterol from LDL and HDL but can also capture phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, and triacylglycerols. This ability to recognize and absorb multiple types of lipids makes P116 an essential mechanism for the survival of the microorganism. By supplying its membrane with components obtained directly from the host, Mycoplasma pneumoniae can adapt to different environments in the body and colonize tissues with a high lipid content beyond the respiratory system.

Dr. Noemí Rotllan highlights the biological significance of this finding: ""P116 acts as a lipid entry gate for the bacterium, an extraordinarily versatile system that allows it to incorporate cholesterol, phospholipids, and sphingolipids from the host."" She adds that ""this broad lipid uptake capacity largely explains why Mycoplasma pneumoniae can survive in such diverse environments and localize to tissues where other bacteria would not be able to thrive.""

The study also reveals that a monoclonal antibody specifically directed against the C-terminal domain of P116 markedly blocks cholesterol uptake by the bacterium, a process essential for its survival.

By preventing P116 from functioning as a lipid entry system, the antibody significantly reduces the growth of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in cell cultures and limits its ability to adhere to human atherosclerotic lesions in ex vivo samples. This dual action-slowing bacterial proliferation and preventing its presence in vulnerable areas of the cardiovascular system-represents a major advance in understanding the pathogenic and extra respiratory role of this microorganism.""

Dr. Marina Marcos, researcher at UAB

The researchers emphasize that preventing this adhesion is particularly relevant because the presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in vulnerable plaques could promote local inflammation and compromise lesion stability. Unstable plaques are more prone to rupture, a process that can trigger serious cardiovascular events.

Dr. Joan Carles Escolà-Gil underscores its potential: ""The antibody targets the bacterium's key point, which is its ability to capture cholesterol. By blocking P116, we slow its growth and prevent it from adhering to atherosclerotic lesions."" He adds that ""this is relevant because the presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in vulnerable plaques could contribute to inflammation and compromise their stability. Preventing this adhesion offers an opportunity to further protect tissues affected by atherosclerosis.""

The researchers have also used a modified and harmless form of the bacterium, designed to serve as a biotechnological tool to study how it distributes within the body. This version of the microorganism retains its natural ability to localize to lipid-rich tissues but has been adapted so that it does not cause disease. In experiments with hypercholesterolemic mice, the modified bacterium selectively accumulates in the liver and in atherosclerotic plaques, making it a potential vehicle for delivering therapeutic molecules or diagnostic agents precisely to the tissues where they are most needed.

This capacity for specific targeting opens a promising avenue in an emerging area of biotechnology: the use of modified living microorganisms as systems for targeted delivery of therapeutic molecules. In the case of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, its minimalist metabolism and dependence on host lipids make it particularly attractive as a manipulable and safe platform.

Dr. Noemí Rotllan summarizes it as follows: ""The modified version of Mycoplasma pneumoniae shows a natural tropism toward the liver and atherosclerotic lesions, making it a promising biotechnological platform for the study and treatment of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases."" She adds that ""leveraging the biology of this microorganism in a controlled way allows us to envision targeted therapeutic strategies that are more precise and potentially more effective for acting on tissues affected by atherosclerosis or fatty liver disease.""

Beyond its biomedical relevance, the study provides a conceptual advance in understanding Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a pathogen with one of the smallest known bacterial genomes, which depends heavily on the host to obtain essential lipids. Identifying P116 as a fundamental mechanism of lipid uptake opens new avenues for the development of antimicrobial therapies and vaccines.

Scientists from the Joint Electron Microscopy Center at the ALBA Synchrotron, the University of Navarra Clinic, and the Navarra Health Research Institute (IdiSNA) also participated in the research. They contributed to the structural characterization of P116, the analysis of its interaction with antibodies, and imaging and biodistribution studies in animal models.

The work strengthens a multidisciplinary scientific collaboration among leading centers in structural biology, microbiology, cardiometabolism, and biomedical imaging. It places this line of research at the forefront of the design of new biotechnological tools based on modified microorganisms to study and intervene in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.

Novel hybrid polymer nanocarriers enable effective vaccine delivery in the lungs and the targeted activation of immune cells.

An LMU research team led by Professor Olivia M. Merkel, Chair of Drug Delivery at LMU, have developed a new delivery system for inhalable mRNA vaccines. Published in the journal Cell Biomaterials, the study presents a novel combination of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(β-amino esters) (PBAEs) designed to overcome key biological barriers in the lungs.

""Effective mucosal vaccination via inhalation requires carrier systems that can penetrate airway mucus while protecting the fragile RNA molecules they carry,"" explains Merkel. Once the lung barrier is overcome, the nanocarriers have to escape from the tiny vesicles (endosomes) that are transporting them and efficiently introduce (transfect) the mRNA into immune cells, which then present the corresponding antigens on their surface.

LMU team engineered a system that achieves these goals through a spatiotemporally coordinated mechanism. The researchers demonstrated that their hybrid nanoparticles efficiently transfect the targeted immune system cells, a critical requirement for robust immune activation, and support both antigen presentation and immune cell maturation. Moreover, the particles successfully crossed the mucus barrier and enabled mRNA expression in ex vivo human precision-cut lung slices, a highly relevant human lung model.

""A major advantage of the new system is its robustness during aerosolization,"" says Merkel. After vibrating-mesh nebulization, the PLGA/PBAE nanocarriers retained higher transfection efficiency than clinically approved lipid nanoparticles, highlighting their suitability for inhaled vaccine applications. ""Our findings show that data-driven polymer design can address multiple delivery barriers simultaneously. This hybrid platform offers a promising alternative to lipid nanoparticles for next-generation pulmonary mRNA vaccines.""

The study was supported by the Bavarian Research Foundation and the European Research Council (ERC). According to the authors, it makes an important contribution to the development of safe, effective, and patient-friendly mucosal vaccines.

Oncologists have achieved some immune system responses in patients with pancreatic cancers using various combinations of vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs, but it's not always clear which therapy is inducing what type of response. To help drive further study, investigators from the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center have made public a free, web-based atlas of mass cytometry profiles from patients with metastatic pancreatic cancers. The work was partly supported by the National Institutes of Health. 

The atlas contains information from 260 cytometry profiles (of markers on immune cells) from blood samples from 64 patients who participated in three clinical trials of two pancreatic cancer vaccines and two checkpoint inhibitors in different permutations, explains Won Jin Ho, M.D., an associate professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and associate director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center's Convergence Institute. 

We have a platform for immune profiling based on 40-plus protein level markers to understand immune system responses. We also study patients before and after treatment so that we can understand longitudinal responses, or how cancer treatments induce changes in the immune system."" 

Won Jin Ho, M.D., associate professor of oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine

A description of the atlas was published in the Jan. 12 issue of Cancer Immunology Research, a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research. The resource, available online through SciServer at sciserver.org/datasets/biomed/cytof_atlas, houses fully annotated cytometry data from three trials. Enabled by collaboration with the Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science at Johns Hopkins, the atlas' user interface and built-in tools simplify comparisons of cell types and expression levels. Researchers plan to add to the atlas over time, including information from tumor tissue analyses, Ho says. 

""Pancreatic cancer is such a lethal disease, which was our motivation to make this public,"" Ho says. The five-year survival rate is just 13%, according to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. ""Our group has done a lot of investigational immunotherapy trials. These are early-phase trials of smaller groups of patients but have been very informative, even if the clinical outcomes have not met what we wanted."" 

Researchers applied new cytometry techniques to blood samples collected in previously completed trials to build the atlas, to help inform development of new therapies. Dimitrios Sidiropoulos, Ph.D., a computational cancer immunologist at Johns Hopkins, co-led the cross-trial integration of the data, finding immune signatures in blood that are distinct to specific immunotherapies and that can be projected onto tumor tissues, demonstrating the utility of the atlas. ""What we're hoping is that scientists can go to this repository, explore the data and generate hypotheses to carry out new studies,"" says Ho. 

Ho and colleagues have made additional data available from their studies: Raw protein expression data are shared in files available on zenodo (doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13937090). Analysis code is available on the GitHub repository (github.com/wjhlab/Immunotherapy-Atlas). 

In the same issue of the journal, Ho and colleagues also reported results of a new phase II study of 57 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer whose disease progressed while on chemotherapy. The trial, led by Dung Le, M.D., the Bloomberg~Kimmel Professor of Cancer Immunotherapy, and Katie Bever, M.D., an assistant professor of oncology, randomized patients to one of two treatment groups: the vaccine CRS-207 plus the immunotherapies anti-PD1 nivolumab and anti-CTLA4 ipilimumab, with or without the vaccine GVAX, during six 21-day cycles. 

While response rates were not significantly different between the groups, in-depth immunologic studies co-led by Amanda Huff, Ph.D., an assistant professor of oncology, observed that the vaccine-based regimens could generate T-cell clones specific to the antigen mesothelin and the mutation KRAS, and that those clones infiltrated the tumors. These findings, communicated as companion publications, are complementary in determining the effects of key immunotherapeutic agents. Adding anti-CTLA4 to the immunotherapy backbone significantly increases the infiltration of antigen-experienced T cells and ""is going to be an important part of future immunotherapy backbones,"" Ho says.

Co-authors of the atlas study were Dimitrios N. Sidiropoulos, Zhehao Zhang, Jennifer N. Durham, Soren Charmsaz, Nicole E. Gross, Jae W. Lee, Yanyi Sun, Susheel Perikala, Joseph A. Tandurella, Dmitrijs Lvovs, Arik Mitschang, Gerard Lemson, Sarah M. Shin, Alexei G. Hernandez, Sarah Mitchell, James M. Leatherman, Ludmila Danilova, Hao Wang, Elana J. Fertig, Elizabeth M.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study finds growing long-term antipsychotic prescribing in elderly dementia patients","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260116/Study-finds-growing-long-term-antipsychotic-prescribing-in-elderly-dementia-patients.aspx","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 04:29:00 GMT","

When agitated dementia patients wander or shout through the night, families and caregivers understandably feel the need to treat this frightening and potentially dangerous behavior. Antipsychotic medications are often resorted to with such patients, contributing to increases in antipsychotic treatment rates among older people.

Indeed, a research letter by Rutgers and Columbia University researchers in JAMA Psychiatry shows those prescriptions are becoming more common in the United States, even though antipsychotic drugs do little for dementia and carry a black-box warning on their labels stating they increase the risk of death in senior patients.

Using a national prescription-claims database that captures more than 90% of retail pharmacy fills, researchers tracked antipsychotic use among adults 65 and older from 2015 through 2024 and found that the annual rate of any antipsychotic use increased nearly 52% to 4.05 per 100 from 2015 to 2024. Long-term use, defined as at least 120 days a year, rose 65% to 2.45 per 100 older adults. Rates were highest among people 75 and older, rising from 3.42 to 5.12 per 100.

The trend is striking because antipsychotics have limited proven effectiveness in people 65 and older and serious risks, including falls, fractures, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, pulmonary embolism and death. Antipsychotics may be used as a last resort to manage severe behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, such as aggression, agitation, hallucinations, or delusions, especially when these symptoms pose a risk to the safety of the individual or others. However, such use carries substantial risk and should be avoided in most cases and limited to short-term use whenever possible.

""The evidence is pretty solid on the risks,"" said Stephen Crystal, the letter's co-author and director of the Center for Health Services Research at the Rutgers Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research.

The claims data don't include diagnoses, so the researchers couldn't determine why each prescription was written or whether it was appropriate. Antipsychotics remain essential for some people, including those with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder with psychosis or other severe psychiatric illnesses.

However, Crystal noted those conditions aren't common enough in older populations to explain the surging number of antipsychotic prescriptions.

""We think that conditions like schizophrenia that have FDA-approved indications for antipsychotic treatment are unlikely to account for the majority of the rates of use that we observed,"" he said.

The biggest concern for the researchers is using antipsychotics for the behavioral and psychological symptoms that can accompany dementia: agitation, wandering, acting out behavior and shouting. In many cases, the medications are used to ""damp down"" behaviors that are distressing to caregivers and disruptive to facilities, said Crystal, who also holds endowed professorships at the Institute for Health and Rutgers School of Social Work.

Because the drugs can be highly sedating, they reduce the tendency to roam and act out, but that sedation comes with a steep tradeoff for frail patients, increasing fall risk and reducing physical activity.

The study also reveals a shift in who manages cases. Among patients who took an antipsychotic in a given year, the share with at least one prescription from a psychiatrist fell from 30% in 2015 to 20% in 2024. Over the same period, the share who filled an antipsychotic from a pharmacy in a long-term care facility rose from 14% to 21%.

Crystal said the decline in psychiatrist involvement matters because optimal care for behavioral symptoms in dementia often starts with careful evaluation rather than a quick prescription. Clinicians may need to confirm the diagnosis and look for treatable causes that can mimic or worsen confusion, including medication interactions, infections, depression and unmanaged pain. Even when dementia is the main driver, nondrug approaches can work, but they require training, staffing and time.

This can look like managing symptoms. Which is common because it's so much easier to write a prescription than do the work of addressing the underlying condition, particularly at nursing home and assisted living facilities that are dangerously short-staffed.""

Stephen Crystal, director, Center for Health Services Research at the Rutgers Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research

There was one potentially encouraging sign in the data: the use of first-generation antipsychotics, which are associated with higher mortality risk in older patients than second-generation medications, declined from 22% to 14%.

Still, the overall rise in use and the growth in long-term prescribing suggest a system leaning more heavily on medication to solve problems that are often social, environmental and staffing-related. The authors have called for renewed efforts to evaluate and spread nonpharmacological interventions that can reduce reliance on antipsychotics in older adults.

For families contending with a new prescription, the study's lead author, Mark Olfson of the Columbia University Department of Psychiatry, said that it is reasonable to ask what problem the drug is meant to address and what other steps have been tried. Just as important is what happens next: whether the clinician has a plan to reassess, taper and stop the medication once a crisis has passed.

""These are high-stakes decisions,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Alternative splicing of DOC2A gene shown to drive schizophrenia risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260116/Alternative-splicing-of-DOC2A-gene-shown-to-drive-schizophrenia-risk.aspx","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 04:05:00 GMT","

In an important new study, Chinese researchers have discovered the previously unrecognized role of alternative splicing of the DOC2A gene in schizophrenia.

The research was conducted by scientists led by LI Ming from the Kunming Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and published in Science Advances on January 16.

Splicing is a process in which RNA is cut and recombined into the final RNA strand that determines how a protein-encoded by DNA-is formed. Different splicing signals for the same RNA strand can generate protein isoforms that function differently. The varied splicing signals may be generated by very small genetic variants in DNA-such as synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-that alter a single nucleotide without changing the encoded amino acid sequence.

Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants associated with schizophrenia, the biological functions related to most of these statistical associations are poorly understood.

To address this problem, the researchers sought to understand how different variants affect splicing and thus produce different protein isoforms.

Using splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) analyses of human postmortem brain tissues, the researchers identified more than 17,000 schizophrenia-associated sQTLs across the genome. Among them, the SNP rs3935873 showed the strongest prediction for disrupting DOC2A splicing. Experimental validation confirmed that this variant promotes the expression of a truncated protein isoform, DOC2A△Val217–Pro218, while leaving the full-length transcript unaffected. The isoform was previously unannotated (undocumented).

In murine models, overexpression of this isoform in the hippocampus recapitulated schizophrenia-like behaviors, including anxiety, impaired sensorimotor gating, and anhedonia. These phenotypes were absent in control mice or in mice that expressed full-length DOC2A.

Electrophysiological recordings further revealed enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission, and interactome profiling highlighted distinct molecular pathways, such as myosin II complex enrichment, suggesting altered synaptic functions.

These findings integrate genetic, transcriptomic, and behavioral evidence to underscore the critical role of alternative splicing in the genetic regulation of schizophrenia. They also provide a framework for investigating unannotated isoforms in disease pathogenesis. The study not only describes the functional impact of a specific risk variant but also highlights the significance of isoform-specific mechanisms, suggesting potential avenues for targeted therapeutic strategies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New research compares different wellbeing-focused interventions delivered to adults","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260116/New-research-compares-different-wellbeing-focused-interventions-delivered-to-adults.aspx","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 04:55:00 GMT","

As another new year gets under way many of us will be looking for a way of boosting how we feel but is it better to hit the gym or mediate in nature? Now new research by Swansea experts has provided the largest ever comparison of wellbeing-focused interventions delivered to adults.

The team reviewed 183 randomized controlled trials, representing almost 23,000 participants, and evaluated 12 categories of interventions ranging from psychological, physical, mind–body, and nature-based approaches to find out more. Their research was the first interdisciplinary comparison carried out across psychological, physical, mind-body and environmental interventions.

The study, which has just been published Nature Human Behaviour, gives an integrated view of how different disciplines contribute to wellbeing. By focusing on general adult samples rather than clinical groups, it provides evidence that will be relevant to developing public health, education, workplace wellbeing, and community programmes.

The researchers' key findings were:

First author Dr Lowri Wilkie, from the School of Psychology, said: ""Our analysis shows that there is no single route to improving wellbeing. Mindfulness, compassion-based approaches, yoga, exercise and positive psychology interventions all showed moderate benefits compared with control groups, and combining physical activity with psychological interventions appeared particularly promising.

""By using network meta-analysis, we were able to compare very different interventions from different disciplines within one framework, giving policymakers and practitioners a much clearer view of the range of effective options available for building wellbeing in the general population.""

Because interventions were tested in general populations, the evidence is directly relevant to population wellbeing strategies, including efforts to enhance resilience and support mental health before problems escalate. The study's results complement the Swansea-led GENIAL framework, which emphasises wellbeing as being grounded by connection to self, to others, and to nature.

Senior author Professor Andrew Kemp added: ""What this study makes clear is that wellbeing can be supported through multiple, evidence-based pathways. Psychological interventions, exercise and mind–body practices all perform well, which means services and policymakers have real flexibility to design programmes that fit different settings and preferences.

""For us, this paper also marks an important milestone in a long-running collaboration between Swansea University and Swansea Bay University Health Board, and it highlights how rigorous, interdisciplinary research can inform population-level approaches to mental health and wellbeing.""

Co-author Dr Zoe Fisher, a consultant clinical psychologist with SBUHB, said: ""For practitioners and services, these findings are extremely useful. The study shows that a range of interventions can reliably improve wellbeing, which means we can tailor support according to the needs and preferences of different communities.

""Having evidence of this breadth and quality strengthens the foundation for developing accessible, flexible wellbeing programmes across Swansea Bay and beyond.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study reveals how ketogenic diet protects against epilepsy seizures","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260116/Study-reveals-how-ketogenic-diet-protects-against-epilepsy-seizures.aspx","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 04:34:00 GMT","

University of Virginia School of Medicine researchers have revealed how the popular, low-carb ketogenic diet protects against epilepsy seizures and possibly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

Keto, as the diet is commonly known, has been used to reduce seizures in patients with medication-resistant epilepsy since the 1920s. Doctors, however, have been uncertain exactly how the diet does this, even as they identified potential benefits for other brain disorders.

A team led by UVA's Jaideep Kapur, MBBS, PhD, co-director of UVA's Brain Institute, has found answers. This discovery could eventually allow patients to reap the benefits of the keto diet without the highly restrictive eating – almost devoid of sweet treats and comforting carbohydrates – necessary to stay ""in keto."" 

The body converts the keto diet to a ketone body called β-hydroxybutyrate. We discovered that HCAR2 helps β-hydroxybutyrate reduce seizures by regulating the activity and communication of brain cells. Many individuals are unable to tolerate the keto diet due to high fat content and side effects. This discovery helps find drugs that have the beneficial effects of the keto diet. Niacin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, also works on HCAR2.""

Jaideep Kapur, MBBS, PhD, an epileptologist (epilepsy expert) at UVA Health and the School of Medicine's Department of Neurology and Neuroscience

The keto diet aims to encourage our bodies to burn fat instead of carbohydrates for fuel. This can provide obvious benefits for those trying to lose weight, but it also causes unseen changes in the body, and many people cannot tolerate such a high-fat diet. Keto prompts our livers to produce molecules called ketones (ketosis), which replace easily burned carbohydrates as fuel for our brain cells. 

Kapur, researcher Soudabeh Naderi and their colleagues found that one of the most common of these ketones, β-hydroxybutyrate, interacts with a specific cellular receptor to reduce seizures in lab mice. It does this by calming nerve cells called neurons, the scientists found. When neurons become too excitable, they can trigger seizures. Hyperactive neurons are also seen in early Alzheimer's and in other conditions, such as autism.

As part of their research, Kapur and his team mapped out the receptor's presence in the hippocampus, the portion of the brain where seizures often begin. They found the receptor, hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2, was concentrated in a particular cell type already linked to seizures. The receptor was also common in immune cells called microglia that patrol and protect the brain.

The researchers' work suggests that it may be possible to develop drugs to give patients the brain benefits of the ketogenic diet without being on the highly restrictive diet, which can come with unwanted side effects such as gastrointestinal distress. For example, the scientists' early work in lab mice suggests that niacin – vitamin B3 – may provide at least some benefit, though more research would be needed to determine if this benefit holds true in people.

""We are now exploring how this receptor modulates brain immune responses through microglia,"" Kapur said. ""These studies would allow us to come up with novel therapies for drug-resistant epilepsy and potentially other disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.""

Finding better ways to treat epilepsy, Alzheimer's, and other neurological diseases is a core mission of UVA's new Paul and Diane Manning Institute of Biotechnology. That institute works together with UVA's Brain Institute to bring top experts across UVA to speed up the transformation of basic scientific discoveries into new treatments and cures that will help patients across Virginia and around the world.

Kapur and his colleagues have published their new findings in the scientific journal Annals of Neurology. The research team consisted of Soudabeh Naderi, John Williamson, Huayu Sun, Suchitra Joshi, Rachel Jane Spera, Savaira Zaib, Supriya Sharma, Chengsan Sun, Andrey Brodovskiy, Ifrah Zawar and Kapur. The scientists have no financial interest in the work.

The research was supported by the National Institute of Health's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, grants R01NS120945 and R37NS119012, and the UVA Brain Institute.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","University of Cincinnati receives AMA grant to advance precision medical education","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260116/University-of-Cincinnati-receives-AMA-grant-to-advance-precision-medical-education.aspx","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 03:53:00 GMT","

The University of Cincinnati College of Medicine has been selected as a recipient of an American Medical Association (AMA) grant to use artificial intelligence to advance physician training through personalized learning.

The college will receive a $1.1 million AMA Transforming Lifelong Learning Through Precision Education grant in the next four years to fund its project, ""Ambient AI for precision feedback: Augmenting clinical reasoning and communication using real-time feedback"".

The AMA chose 11 team recipients from among nearly 200 applicants. The College of Medicine distinguished itself as an innovator and leader in precision education, advancing efforts to strengthen the physician workforce and support high-quality patient care.

Precision education models use data and technology, including augmented intelligence, to tailor learning to each learner's needs. These models help medical students, residents and physicians focus on developing the skills and competencies that matter most in diagnosing, communicating with and caring for patients.

Medical trainees face insufficient high-quality feedback to inform their continued development in clinical settings. The College of Medicine's project will use data collected through systems and devices in their environment, like eyeglasses and smartphones, to capture interactions and provide personalized feedback on their clinical reasoning and communication skills, allowing trainees to refine how they connect with patients and think through complex diagnoses. 

To achieve this, UC investigators will extend use of their 2-Sigma AI platform, which has been providing on-demand, adaptive AI simulations to provide personalized learning experiences and feedback on clinical skills to medical students.

The grant's principal investigator Laurah Turner, PhD, and her team will develop AI algorithms for feedback delivery via smartphone app and through heads-up display in AI glasses, which will project crucial information in users' line of sight. The team will test it with approximately 600 trainees, both medical students and residents, at two sites. They then will scale from simulation to authentic patient encounters. 

Just as data analytics transformed professional sports, precision education is poised to transform how we train physicians. Medical trainees spend thousands of hours in clinical settings but receive feedback on only a fraction of their patient encounters. We're moving to a model where every patient encounter becomes a learning opportunity. That's the promise of precision education.""

 Laurah Turner, PhD, the College of Medicine's associate dean of artificial intelligence and educational informatics

""Being selected as a recipient of this grant is a significant milestone for the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine,"" said Gregory Postel, MD, dean of the College of Medicine, Christian R. Holmes professor, executive vice president for health affairs at UC and chair of the UC Health Board of Directors. ""Dr. Laurah Turner's pioneering work with ambient AI represents the next frontier in medical training. By leveraging real-time data to deliver personalized feedback, we can optimize learning for our students and residents while ensuring the next generation of physicians is prepared to deliver high-quality, precision-based care to our patients and community.""

The College of Medicine will collaborate with Arizona State University's School of Medicine and Medical Engineering and HonorHealth, a large health care system in the Phoenix metropolitan area.

UC's project directly advances the AMA's precision education goals through tech-enabled assessment, personalizing training experiences and deploying new learning models across undergraduate and graduate medical education.

""Technology and AI have the potential to reshape how physicians learn, practice and care for their patients, and these grants will help bring that potential to life,"" said AMA CEO John Whyte, MD. ""As new tools emerge, we have an opportunity to build learning environments that are more engaging, more adaptable and better aligned with the realities of practicing medicine. Our goal is to ensure that innovation strengthens the physician experience and creates a future where every physician is fully equipped to meet the needs of patients.""

The AMA's $12 million investment will expand access to cutting-edge technology and systems that make learning more efficient, effective, and focused on optimal patient care. The Transforming Lifelong Learning Through Precision Education Grant Program was developed with national experts in augmented intelligence, assessment and medical education and follows more than a decade of AMA leadership through its ChangeMedEd® Initiative, which has invested nearly $50 million in reimagining medical education.

Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in American men.

About 1 in 8 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, and the risk varies depending on age and race.

Prostate cancer is primarily screened by the levels of prostate-specific antigen in the blood.

Although an estimated 10 million PSA tests are performed annually, there are few tools available to interpret the results and help patients decide what course of action to take.

University of Michigan researchers have developed a model that can help doctors and patients understand their PSA results and what they mean for patient life expectancy.

Current tools don't take into account how long someone may live or the benefit a patient may receive from treatment.

Our model is the first to incorporate all these factors and help people understand whether they need further screening or treatment.""

Kristian Stensland, M.D., M.P.H., M.S., Assistant Professor of Urology

Existing risk calculators are less accurate or predict prostate cancer risk through biopsy-based tests based on biopsy, which requires tissue samples and extra processing time.

In a previous study, the researchers showed that PSA scores can impact both doctor and patient behavior, leading to biopsy referrals even when the risk of harm from prostate cancer is low.

With this model, they hope that only patients who might benefit from further screening and treatment will receive referrals.

The new model relies on PSA scores and was developed using data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, which recruited more than 33,000 patients aged 55 to 74 years from 1993 to 2001.

The researchers also took family history of prostate cancer, race, age, body mass index, smoking status and a history of hypertension, diabetes or stroke into account.

After building the model, they tested it using PSA scores from more than 200,000 patients who received care in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System in the same age range from 2002 to 2006.

The model was able to predict the risk for prostate cancer-specific mortality and highlight which patients would benefit from further treatment.

""It is important to remember that we created and tested the model using data from two decades ago and a lot has changed since then,"" Stensland said.

""Even though prostate cancer treatment is different now, our model improves on previous tools and can be used to decide how we do PSA screens.""

The researchers are now working to implement their model in clinical settings.

Durotomy is a common neurosurgical complication involving a tear in the dura mater, the protective membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Damage can cause cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, leading to delayed healing, headaches, and infection, making a reliable watertight dural closure essential.

Tissue adhesives are increasingly explored as alternatives to suturing for dural closure because they offer simpler and faster application. However, many existing glue-based sealants suffer from excessive swelling, leading to mass effect and unwanted tissue adhesion, which can lead to postoperative complications. To address these limitations, researchers have investigated Janus tissue patches, which feature two distinct surfaces-one that adheres strongly to tissue and another that prevents unwanted adhesion. Unfortunately, most existing Janus patches rely on multiple materials and complex, multi-step fabrication processes, limiting their practical use.

In a breakthrough study, a research team from South Korea led by Professor Seung Yun Yang from the Department of Biomaterials Science at Pusan National University has developed an innovative light-responsive, monolithic Janus dural patch using photocurable hyaluronic acid (HA) through a simple approach. ""Made from natural biopolymer hyaluronic acid, our dural patch provides strong wet adhesion, along with a lubricating surface that prevents unwanted tissue adhesion, after exposure to non-toxic visible light,"" explains Prof. Yang. Their study was made available online on December 16, 2025, and published in Volume 527 of Chemical Engineering Journal on January 01, 2026.

The researchers selected HA because of its excellent biocompatibility as well as its intrinsic anti-adhesive and lubricating properties. To enable light activation, HA was chemically modified with photocrosslinkable groups-methacrylate (MA) and 4-pentenoate (PA). The resulting HA-based solution was then lyophilized to form a patch with two distinct surfaces: a dense surface with a high polymer concentration and a porous surface with a lower polymer concentration. To further enhance conformal adhesion to wet tissues, the patch was compressed to a thickness of approximately 0.2 mm. 

Laboratory tests showed that the patch could fully seal the wounds within five seconds using low-energy visible light. The dense outer surface exhibited strong wet adhesion, achieving high burst pressure and approximately 50% lower friction than conventional dural sealants. Notably, the adhesion strength was up to ten times higher than that of commercially available tissue adhesives. Meanwhile, the porous surface efficiently absorbed fluids and helped prevent unintended tissue adhesion. The patch also demonstrated minimal swelling and a reduced mass effect-less than 200% swelling and an approximately 0.1 g increase in weight-along with high stretchability, flexibility, and excellent biocompatibility.

The team also tested the developed patch in a rabbit durotomy model, where it achieved rapid and effective dural closure without causing damage to the surrounding skull, dura mater, or brain tissue. The photocurable dural patch has been transferred to biotech company SNvia, which has established large-scale manufacturing facilities for photocrosslinkable hyaluronic acid. Nonclinical studies are expected to conclude in the first half of 2026, with a medical device clinical trial application to South Korea's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety planned for the same year.

Prof. Yang notes that the technology enables rapid wound sealing, reducing the risk of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Importantly, the study provides practical evidence supporting the clinical safety and applicability of photocrosslinkable hyaluronic acid (HAMA-PA). Its strong adhesion to wet tissues also suggests broader potential for drug-delivery patches, cell-laden constructs, and artificial tissues.

Overall, this innovative dural patch holds great potential for use in diverse applications requiring rapid, watertight sealing.

Long-time U.S. Women's National Team midfielder Rose Lavelle has been voted U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year after a year packed with adversity.

Rose Lavelle has been a fixture in the U.S. Women's National Team midfield for nearly a decade. Yet as she enters her 10th year with the program, the 2025 season marked the first time she was voted U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year.

Lavelle has been a constant presence since her breakout performance at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, where she helped the United States capture its fourth title. In the final at Parc des Princes, Lavelle scored eight minutes after Megan Rapinoe's penalty, providing the decisive goal in a 2-0 win over the Netherlands.

While her impact at the international level has long been established, 2025 marked a resurgent year for the Cincinnati native, who returned after nearly a year sidelined following ankle surgery. Lavelle finally returned to the USWNT roster on June 26, facing the Republic of Ireland. She wasted no time, scoring a goal and earning an assist. She went on to appear in six international matches across 2025, starting five and contributing to the scoresheet in each match she started. 

GOAL dives into how Lavelle ended up winning U.S. Soccer's prestigious award.

Lavelle is used to sharing the ball, the glory, and all of the wins and losses of the sport. And when asked what winning the U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year award means to her, she did a Lavelle-special; she threw in a bunch of assists. 

""When I look at the past year, it feels like a testament to the support system I had, with my family, the medical staff at Gotham and with the National Team, all my teammates, coaches and friends,” Lavelle said. 

""I wouldn't have been in the position to even be up for the award without all of the support I received throughout the year just to get back on the field. So, this award is definitely shared with all the people I was lucky enough to have in my corner along the way.”

Lavelle underwent ankle surgery in December 2024, and would spend the next six months rehabbing to get back out onto the pitch. 

On June 7, 2025, Lavelle took the field for her club team NJ/NY Gotham FC for the first time since her injury. Few could have guessed she'd been away from the game for so much time, given the crispness of her first touch and movement on and off the ball. 

""I think the profile of Rose Lavelle is probably the most rare to find when it's a player that can basically do everything at such a high level,"" Gotham head coach Juan Carlos Amoros said after Lavelle's first game back. ""And then on top of that, she does the special things on the ball that create - why we all watch the sport.""

Lavelle was one of the missing pieces to Gotham's late-season Cinderella run, which carried them from barely making the postseason (No. 8 seed) to winning their second NWSL Championship in three years. 

For Gotham, Lavelle started 13 games of the 16 matches she appeared in, seemingly peaking just when it mattered the most: The end of the season. In the final nine regular season matches of the NWSL season, Lavelle scored five times and she also scored the lone goal to earn Gotham the 1-0 victory over the Washington Spirit for the 2025 NWSL Championship. Her 80th minute goal also helped grant her MVP honors of the match. Between Parc de Princes and PayPal Park, Lavelle became the only person to score in two NWSL Championships and a FIFA Women's World Cup Final. 

“I'm really happy for Rose, who is thriving. She's an extremely selfless person who has been through a lot of adversity,” said USWNT head coach Emma Hayes.

For the USWNT, Lavelle's year got a late start; her first game back against the Republic of Ireland was only the beginning of what she would solidify in the midfield for the Americans. 

On Oct. 26, she famously scored just 34 seconds into the match vs. Portugal. A few days later, she put away a half-volley against New Zealand, and also wore the captain's armband. All in all, Lavelle has 27 goals and 27 assists with the USWNT, making her an official member of the USWNT 50-plus club.

 “I think we all know that Rose is not only one of the best players in the world, but also one of the most fun to watch, and to coach, so it's very satisfying to see her recognized in this way,"" Hayes continued.

When Lavelle found out that she needed surgery, she was entering territory she's never been in before. 

After her first game back for Gotham, she told the media about the experience of getting surgery for the very first time. 

""It was the first time I had to get surgery, which is a blessing, but I definitely was a little naïve to what that entailed... So, it was definitely a lot harder than I anticipated.""

Any surgery and then recovery timeline is different depending on the person, and for Lavelle, she stayed the course and used the time away from the field to focus on parts of the game she hadn't seen before. 

""I think I've found a lot of silver lining during this time away. I think [some] of that is learning how to be a good teammate when I can't be on the field with them, staying present, still having a voice, and helping people where I can.""

Whether humbly accepting the MVP award at the 2025 NWSL Championship or delivering game-winning moments for the USWNT, Rose Lavelle has consistently shown why she remains one of the sport's most distinctive talents. This year, she adds another milestone - becoming the 22nd different player to be named U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year.

Lavelle was left off the USWNT's January camp roster due to club commitments abroad with Gotham, but her place in the program remains unchanged. As Emma Hayes builds toward the 2027 World Cup, it is veterans who have thrived in defining moments - and scored in them - who will shape the team's leadership. Lavelle has long been one of those players.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Los Angeles Football Club and midfielder Yaw Yeboah mutually agreed to part ways on Friday.

LAFC announced that the two-year deal Yeboah signed prior to last season, including a club option for 2027, was terminated effective immediately.

The 28-year-old midfielder from Accra, Ghana, has been on administrative leave from MLS since Oct. 25, pending a league review for potential violations of league rules.

Derrick Jones, a teammate of Yeboah's with the Columbus Crew in 2024, was similarly placed on administrative leave.

The investigation remains ongoing, an MLS representative confirmed this week.

Neither MLS nor LAFC addressed the scope of the inquiry.

A request for comment from Yeboah was not immediately returned.

Yeboah received $550,000 in guaranteed compensation during his first year with LAFC, scoring a goal to go with an assist in 17 MLS appearances. He had three short stints in FIFA Club World Cup contests plus a pair of starts during Leagues Cup play.

The termination came after LAFC was approached about Yeboah by other clubs.

The move frees salary cap space as well as an international roster slot ahead of LAFC's 2026 campaign, which begins Feb. 17 with a CONCACAF Champions Cup match against Real España in Honduras.

Didi Hamann has urged Manchester United to target Thomas Tuchel as their next manager, with the club set to choose a long-term successor to Michael Carrick at season's end. 

Despite the Germany being busy leading England at the World Cup, Hamann believes United should make him their priority over PSG-linked Luis Enrique. 

Tuchel's England contract runs until the 2026 World Cup, but speculation over his future is natural with the Red Devils' role opening next summer. Hamann insists the Old Trafford job would be Tuchel's “dream role.”

 “I wouldn't worry, because I've said all along that the Premier League needs a strong Manchester United. Even as a former Liverpool and City player, I want United to do better because the league benefits from it. It's been far too long for them to be in the doldrums,” he said.

“Enrique has been very successful, but obviously, he would be new to the league. There is talk about Thomas Tuchel, depending on what happens in the World Cup. But obviously, you need to make a decision probably before the World Cup.

“I think Tuchel would be somebody who would be able to turn things around. He doesn't care about names; he doesn't care about anything other than success for the club. 

“They need someone who goes in there now and cuts all ties with whoever is talking and whoever is having a say in the background. You need a strong man who follows his beliefs, and I think Tuchel showed in the past that he can do that.”","{'href': 'https://www.tribalfootball.com', 'title': 'TribalFootball'}","soccer"

FC Bayern's sensation is back just six months after a devastating injury.

Jamal Musiala is back after a gruesome injury, and for Bayern Munich head coach Vincent Kompany, that was never in doubt.

Musiala suffered a ghastly broken leg on the field at last summer's Club World Cup. And while his return to the side is expected to be gradual, it is a triumph that he is on the training pitch at all so soon after the injury.

“I had complete confidence that he would recover. You always have to trust the lads, that it's not a step backwards, but sometimes a step forwards,” Kompany stated in comments captured by @iMiaSanMia. “I'm always there for the players, as are all of us – whether it's Christoph Freund, Max Eberl or one of my assistants. That's very important for us.

“As a player, I often got injured at the start of the season. You want to be back in contention for the trophies at the end. That's a huge motivation for them, and we're only just getting started. These players can make a difference.”

Of course, it's hard to pick and choose the timing of an injury, but Bayern can try to make the most of what has happened so far.

With the kickoff approaching, the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has sparked widespread international concern.

Concerns aren't just speculative. During the 2025 Club World Cup, federal agents were heavily present inside stadiums, resulting in the detention of some fans.

This heightened security presence has fueled what experts call a “fear phobia” among international supporters, who now worry that routine ID checks could escalate into harassment or deportation.

Amid expanded U.S. travel restrictions affecting dozens of countries, a clear double standard has emerged.

Players and coaches are granted “sporting exemptions,” while fans face little protection. Supporters from nations such as Iran and several African countries confront severe obstacles, including total entry bans and intensive scrutiny of social media accounts, effectively excluding them from participating in the event.

The backlash has been swift. Reports indicate that thousands of international fans have canceled tickets in protest. Human rights activists warn that turning stadiums into arenas for mass checks and deportations undermines the FIFA principle of inclusivity.

This situation poses a serious dilemma for the world's largest sporting event:

FIFA has reminded fans that 2026 World Cup tickets don't guarantee entry into the United States – a warning issued in the wake of new visa policies introduced under President Donald Trump.

FIFA shared the reminder while announcing record-breaking demand for tournament tickets. With millions of fans expected to travel, FIFA stressed that entry into host nations is subject to each country's immigration and visa regulations.

The warning comes as the US government rolls out fresh travel restrictions, prompting FIFA to advise fans to apply for visas early and stay up to date with local entry requirements.

In its official press release, FIFA confirmed that fans from all 211 of its member nations submitted ticket requests during the Random Selection Draw phase between December 11 and January 13.

The organisation said it received an average of 15 million requests per day – a figure it described as a new record for global football demand.

Among the most popular matches are Colombia vs Portugal in Miami, Mexico vs South Korea in Guadalajara, and the World Cup final in New York–New Jersey.

The 2026 tournament will feature 104 matches across 16 cities in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

However, FIFA noted that a valid match ticket does not automatically grant entry into any of the three host nations.

Each fan must still meet national immigration criteria and obtain the appropriate visa before travelling to attend games.

The reminder follows recent US visa changes introduced under President Trump, which have created additional requirements for several countries – including some with national teams qualified for the World Cup.

While players and officials are unaffected, fans from certain regions may face longer processing times or extra screening.

FIFA said it is working with local authorities to support international fans with their travel planning and documentation.

The new FIFA Priority Appointment Scheduling System (FIFA PASS) is designed to help approved ticket holders secure US visa appointments ahead of the tournament.

Although tourist visas remain valid, the combination of unprecedented ticket demand and changing travel policies means fans could face greater challenges in arranging their trips to the 2026 World Cup.

A US official has issued a statement after the country caused a stir by announcing a massive visa ban ahead of the World Cup. 

The World Cup is one of the most anticipated sporting events, and for good reason.

Basically, every corner of the globe plays soccer and if nothing else, it is just brilliant to watch nations compete on the biggest stage in the world.

For many, going to watch any game at the FIFA World Cup is a dream come true, but a wrench was recently thrown in a number of fans' plans.

Advert

Earlier this week, President Donald Trump announced that there was an indefinite immigrant visa suspension on a whopping 75 countries.

This comes only a few months ahead of the tournament being held across the US, Canada and Mexico.

The Department of Homeland Security tweeted on January 14: ""The State Department will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates. The freeze will remain active until the U.S. can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.""

Advert

The 75 countries include the likes of Brazil, Colombia, Ghana and Morocco - all of whom have qualified for the tournament.

This has caused much fear and confusion for those wishing to travel to the US to attend the games and soak up the atmosphere.

Luckily, the suspension will not apply to non-immigrant, temporary tourist, or business visas, though. However, some people have still been put off by the ban and admitted to feeling unwelcome in the country.

The US has now clarified its position on the matter.

Advert

Speaking to the Mirror, a US State Department official insisted that the visa ban won't impact those trying to visit the country for the World Cup.

They said the ‘ban applies to the issuance of immigrant visas only, and does not apply to nonimmigrant visas, such as those for tourists, athletes and their families, and media professionals intending to travel for the World Cup'.

In addition, FIFA has issued a statement, echoing this point.

Advert

FIFA President Gianni Infantino said: ""America welcomes the World. We have always said that this will be the greatest and most inclusive FIFA World Cup in history – and the FIFA PASS service is a very concrete example of that.""

As well as non-immigrant visas still being available, FIFA has recently announced the FIFA Priority Appointment Scheduling System (FIFA PASS).

Those who have a valid World Cup ticket can apply for a FIFA PASS, which will give them access to priority visa interview appointments ahead of the tournament.

An official from the US State Department has reportedly spoken out about how Donald Trump's visa bans may impact fans travelling to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted across the US, Canada, and Mexico, is just 145 days away, but there are still widespread concerns among fans about whether the US is fit to host such an event.

Ahead of the tournament, US foreign policy has been a controversial topic, with the US having taken military action in both Venezuela and Nigeria recently, while also suggesting operations could happen in Greenland, Mexico, Colombia, and Iran soon.

This led to 23 UK MPs from four parties – Labour, Liberal Democrats, Green Party, and Plaid Cymru – to sign a motion in parliament calling on international sporting bodies to consider expelling the US from major international competitions, including the World Cup, according to the BBC.

Advert

Some have even suggested that the US should be stripped of the right to co-host the tournament.

This comes after the Trump administration imposed travel restrictions, either blocking or heavily restricting citizens of 12 countries from travelling to the US in June 2025.

Since then, several other nations have been added to the list, including Senegal and the Ivory Coast, who will both compete at this summer's World Cup.

Advert

Haiti and Iran are also on the full restriction ban list, which came into effect on January 1, with both nations' fans wondering whether they will be allowed to travel to see their respective teams play at the tournament.

Then, on Wednesday (January 14), the Trump administration announced that it has indefinitely suspended immigrant visa processing from 75 countries.

The list includes eight World Cup nations - Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Uruguay.

Advert

This added to the confusion among hopeful supporters from the aforementioned nations, but a US State Department official has now shed some light on the situation when speaking to the Mirror.

The official insisted that the visa ban will not affect the World Cup, with some fans wondering if they could be turned away at the border.

The official said that the ""ban applies to the issuance of immigrant visas only, and does not apply to non-immigrant visas, such as those for tourists, athletes and their families, and media professionals intending to travel for the World Cup"".

Shortly after the move was announced, Tommy Pigott, Principal Deputy spokesperson for the US State Department, explained that the reason for the visa freeze was to ""prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits”.

Advert

The US State Department had earlier stated that the decision was to bring ""an end to the abuse"" of the system “by those who would extract wealth from the American people"" via benefits paid by US taxpayers. The freeze will be enforced from January 21.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Barcelona set to lose midfield wonderkid! Blaugrana stunned after La Masia talent pays own release clause amid Man City interest","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/barcelona-lose-wonderkid-pays-release-clause-man-city-interest/bltfc874b8451df0bac","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 13:12:24 GMT","

Barcelona are reportedly set to lose La Masia academy star Dro Fernandez during the January transfer window. The talented midfielder has been making inroads into Hansi Flick's first-team squad this season but it is said he has activated his own €6 million release clause to seal an exit. This comes at a time when he has been linked with Manchester City, Chelsea, and more.

In December, Barca boss Flick was open to the idea of the club needing defensive reinforcements in light of Andreas Christensen's knee injury. While Ronald Araujo is now back from his break in a bid to improve his mental health, the German still wanted more backup.

""Defender in the January transfer window? We'll see. I'll talk to Deco, maybe tomorrow, not today. For me, first and foremost, the important thing is that Andreas (Christensen) returns in good shape,"" he said.

Then, at the start of January, when the severity of Christensen's injury came to light, he sent a crystal clear message to the board.

He added: ""I spoke with my staff, and with Deco we speak a lot. And we think that when Ronald [Araujo] is back we have good alternatives at centre-back. Joao can play on both sides, he can give us good options. But in the end, until now, it's not done, but I'd be happy if it goes through. He's another option for the offence. We talked about signing a centre-back, but I think it makes more sense, I think it is a good option, and a high quality player.

""We've had a situation these past two years where we have to be smart about the players we sign. It's not like the other clubs, who can play hundreds of millions on players. But I think it's good, you can see our players are progressing. Our young players are developing, and we have faith in them. Now we have the opportunity to bring in a veteran. I'd appreciate it if he comes.""

Sure enough, Barca delivered, this time with the loan deal of full-back Joao Cancelo from Al-Hilal.

But it seems they will lose one exciting Barca prospect in Fernandez. Both Spanish outlets Sport and Mundo Deportivo claim the 18-year-old will leave La Liga's leaders this month as he seeks more first-team opportunities. While he has played five times for the first team this season, it seems the teenager has his sights set on accruing more minutes elsewhere. Barcelona's director of football, Deco, is said to have been attempting to renew his contract, which expires in the summer of 2027, but Fernandez has reportedly told the club he will leave. According to journalist Ben Jacobs, City, Chelsea, and Borussia Dortmund are in the running to sign the youngster but Paris Saint-Germain are the frontrunners. He adds that there have been positive talks but nothing has been signed yet. Incidentally, Fermin Lopez and Dani Olmo are ahead of him in the number 10 pecking order at the Catalan outfit, ergo, there is no clear pathway to game time under Flick for now.

In light of these reports, Flick is said to be furious that Fernandez will be leaving Barca. The former Bayern Munich manager has reportedly taken a special liking to the midfielder and appreciated his talent. He took Fernandez on Barca's pre-season tour to Japan and South Korea last summer and handed him his debut this season, so this turn of events is a 'big disappointment' for the Blaugrana manager. Moreover, Flick feels the club are letting an exciting talent leave the club.

Speaking in a press conference on Saturday, the German tactician pointedly said: ""If you want to play for Barca, you have to give everything... 100%. That's what I want to say to everyone who is with us now or could be with us in the future. Same applies for La Masia youngsters training with the first team. They have to be here 100%. These colours must be defended, that's what I want to see. As for the rest, I don't want them.""

It remains to be seen if Barca will be able to keep hold of Fernandez or if he will indeed make a January exit. Following this update on his future, it will be interesting to see if he plays any part in their upcoming games against Real Sociedad on Sunday, away at Slavia Prague in the Champions League in midweek, or at home to Oviedo in the league next Sunday.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Our expert offers the best Manchester United vs Manchester City predictions and betting tips for the first Manchester derby of the 2025/26 EPL

Michael Carrick prepares to take charge as interim Manchester United manager for the first time against Pep Guardiola's City at Old Trafford.

All odds are courtesy of bet365, correct at the time of publishing and subject to change.

Manchester City have now won five of their last six away games in all competitions. Their cup demolition of Exeter was impressive, but their solid EFL Cup semi-final first-leg win at Newcastle was even better. Newcastle had won 11 of their last 13 games at St James' Park, yet City kept them at arm's length for most of the contest.

Guardiola's men have shown they can thrive in intense atmospheres. Old Trafford is bound to be rocking on Saturday lunchtime.

City are unbeaten in their last 13 games in all competitions, and United are on a four-game winless streak. That's why backing the visitors seems like a smart play. United have won only two of their last ten home games against City in the Premier League.

Eight of the last ten meetings between United and City have featured three or more goals. However, there appears to be value in the Under 2.5 Goals market this weekend. Three of United's last four home EPL games have ended with two or fewer goals scored.

Meanwhile, four of City's last five games have also ended in Under 2.5 Goals wins. City have averaged fewer than one goal conceded per game this season. Despite their makeshift central defence, they have been dynamic and powerful at the back in recent weeks.

Looking back further at the history books, 44% of the last 50 Manchester derbies have finished with two or fewer goals scored. Yet, the betting markets price the probability at just 40% this weekend, so there is clear value.

It has been a wonderful start to life at Manchester City for the new signing, Antoine Semenyo. The former AFC Bournemouth powerhouse has scored two times in his opening two games. The Ghanaian international scored one and set up another in City's 10-1 FA Cup win over Exeter. He then scored City's opening goal in their 2-0 EFL Cup semi-final first leg win at Newcastle.

Semenyo has 13 goal contributions in 20 EPL appearances so far in 2025/26. In all competitions, he has 16 goal contributions in 23 games at a strike rate of 69.60%.

Yet, the betting markets believe he only has a 51.28% chance of scoring or assisting in this weekend's Manchester derby. Should he come through the Newcastle game unscathed, this will be the pure value bet.

Manchester City travel to Old Trafford. They are set to face a new-look Manchester United under the management of new interim boss Michael Carrick.

United took the bold decision to fire Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese boss failed to make his signature 3-4-3 system work with the Red Devils. Although Darren Fletcher has deputised in recent games, Carrick has been recruited to lead the team for the remainder of the season.

It's not all doom and gloom for United. They currently sit seventh, but only three points shy of fourth-placed Liverpool. A positive result against City could reignite their Champions League qualification hopes. Although they've only won one of their last six EPL games, they've also lost just one of those fixtures. This suggests they've been hard to beat despite not dominating sides.

City have drawn their last three EPL games, allowing Arsenal to extend their lead at the summit to six points. Pep Guardiola's men are the division's leading scorers, with 45 goals scored in 21 games. They've added fresh firepower to their front line in the shape of Antoine Semenyo. He has scored two goals in his first two games since joining from AFC Bournemouth.

With such an abundance of attacking riches at City's disposal, it's no surprise they've started games on the front foot of late. They've scored first in eight of their last nine matches. If they do so on Saturday lunchtime, it will be difficult for United to find a way back into the contest.

Manchester United expected lineup: Lammens, Shaw, Dalot, Maguire, Martinez, Ugarte, Casemiro, Fernandes, Cunha, Mbeumo, Sesko

Manchester City expected lineup: Donnarumma, Nunes, O'Reilly, Ake, Khusanov, Rodri, Cherki, Silva, Foden, Semenyo, Haaland","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Jurgen Klopp gave a hilarious reaction to an interviewer's cheeky remark about Real Madrid as the German continues to be linked with the Bernabeu hotseat. The former Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund manager has seen his name crop up among the list of reported candidates to succeed Xabi Alonso, who was sacked after less than eight months in charge of the Spanish giants.

Following months of intense speculation surrounding his future, Alonso left his position as Real head coach on Monday. While the club announced the decision was by “mutual consent”, it has been widely reported that the Spaniard - who represented Los Blancos as a player between 2009 and 2014 - was dismissed on the back of the club's 3-2 Spanish Super Cup final defeat against Clasico rivals Barcelona.

Real said in a statement: ""Xabi Alonso will always have the affection and admiration of all Madrid fans because he is a Real Madrid legend and has always represented the values of our club. Real Madrid will always be his home.

“Our club thanks Xabi Alonso and his entire coaching staff for their work and dedication throughout this time, and wishes them the best of luck in this new stage of their lives.”

Alonso was named as Carlo Ancelotti's successor at Real in June 2025, having earned rave reviews for his work at Bayer Leverkusen, whom he led to the Bundesliga and German Cup double in 2023-24.

The 44-year-old has since been replaced by Alvaro Arbeloa, but his former Liverpool team-mate's tenure got off to a nightmare start as Real were beaten 3-2 by second division side Albacete in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.

With the length of Arbeloa's contract undisclosed, there is mounting speculation that Real are planning to keep their options open as they weigh up the perfect long-term replacement for Alonso.

One man who has been strongly linked with making a blockbuster move to Real is Klopp, who has been out of work since leaving Liverpool at the end of the 2023-24 Premier League season.

The 58-year-old is widely regarded as one of the greatest managers of his generation, having led the Reds to numerous honours including the 2019-20 Premier League title - the club's first league crown for 30 years.

Before spending nine years in the Anfield dugout, Klopp managed Borussia Dortmund, whom he steered to back-to-back Bundesliga titles in 2010-11 and 2011-12 during a trophy-laden seven-year spell in his homeland.

And with speculation rife over a possible switch to Real, Klopp had to negotiate a brazen question from one reporter while enjoying a spot of basketball this week.

Stopping for a quick interview with ESPN Netherlands while attending the NBA showdown between the Orlando Magic and the Memphis Grizzlies in Berlin, the tactician was told that “they really love basketball at Real Madrid as well” - a nod to Real Madrid Baloncesto, who are known as one of Europe's best basketball teams.

As custom, Klopp belted out his trademark laugh in response to the remark, before politely adding: “Yeah, it's great. Maybe some of them [at Real] watched the game tonight.”

Jürgen Klopp lacht Real Madrid-geruchten weg 👀😂 #klopp #realmadrid #nbaberlingame

While it remains up in the air as to whether Real would like to install Klopp as their next manager, the Spanish heavyweights will be hoping to return to winning ways when they entertain Levante at the Bernabeu on Saturday afternoon.

Arbeloa's side - who are currently four points behind fierce rivals Barcelona in the table - will then return to Champions League action when they play host to Monaco on Tuesday, with the 15-time champions currently seventh in the standings and on course to automatically qualify for the last-16 stage.

Ahead of the game against Levante, new manager Arbeloa pleaded with the club's fanbase to back his players, telling a pre-match press conference: “I understand Madrid fans are hurt and upset with us. But I ask for their support for the players. I ask the fans that despite the disappointment they feel, they're on our side.”

Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham were booed by a section of Real Madrid fans before and during their clash with Levante. Following Xabi Alonso's sacking and Los Blancos' Copa del Rey humiliation at the hands of second-tier side Albacete, the Santiago Bernabeu faithful turned their ire towards the attacking duo and club president Florentino Perez.

Following Madrid's Spanish Super Cup final loss to Barcelona last weekend, Alonso's reign in charge came to an end, with the Spaniard ostensibly leaving by ""mutual consent"". 

The Spanish giants said in a statement: ""Real Madrid CF announces that, by mutual agreement between the club and Xabi Alonso, it has been decided to end his time as first team coach. Xabi Alonso will always have the affection and admiration of all Madrid fans because he is a Real Madrid legend and has always represented the values of our club. Real Madrid will always be his home. Our club thanks Xabi Alonso and his entire technical team for their work and dedication during this time, and wishes them the best of luck in this new stage of their lives.""

While this would have been a bitter disappointment for the former Madrid player, Alonso released a classy statement after his departure. 

He wrote on Instagram: ""This professional stage concludes, and it has not turned out as we would have liked. Coaching Real Madrid has been an honour and a responsibility. I thank the club, the players, and above all the fans and Madrid fans for their trust and support. I leave with respect, gratitude, and pride that I did my best.""

The club's B team manager, Alvaro Arbeloa, was swiftly announced as his successor but the former Liverpool man got off to the worst possible start when they lost in the cup to lower league opposition. 

Madrid's top scorer Kylian Mbappe was one of the first Los Blancos stars to pay tribute to Alonso following his exit. Team-mate Bellingham was a bit slower in sending his best wishes to the Spaniard, something he was branded a 'snake' over. But the former Borussia Dortmund star - who said on social media to Alonso, ""Thank you, Mister. It was a pleasure, all the very best for the future!"" - hit back at reports he did not support Alonso when he was in the dugout. 

This week, he wrote: ""Until now l've let far too many of these slide, always hoping the truth will come to light in its own time. But honestly... What a load of sh*t. Truly feel sorry for the people that hang onto the every word of these clowns and their 'sources'. Do not believe everything you read, every now and then these lot need to be held accountable for spreading this kind of damaging misinformation for clicks and added controversy.""

Perhaps in light of this, and rumours that Vinicius Jr was not a big fan of Alonso's management style, Madrid fans booed their names when they were announced before the Levante encounter in La Liga on Saturday. Club president Perez was also on the receiving end of some criticism from the supporters, with some calling for his resignation. Vinicius Jr was later seen being consoled by his team-mates as he took the extra loud boos to heart. And during the game, the boos were extremely loud for the Brazil international.

In the end, Madrid went on to win the game 2-0, a result that saw them close to within one point of La Liga leaders Barcelona. Hansi Flick's men can extend that gap to four points if they beat Real Sociedad on Sunday but this Madrid victory may quieten the naysayers for a short while.

Real Madrid turned an unconvincing first half into a clinical second, with Kylian Mbappe leading the charge as they saw off Levante, 2-0. Los Blancos were initially languid under new manager Alvaro Arbeloa, but clicked into gear once the deadlock was broken, and were ultimately good value for the victory - even if some questions about individuals remain.

Madrid rather struggled throughout the opening half as the boos rained down in the first home game since Xabi Alonso's sacking and the subsequent exit from the Copa del Rey at Albacete. The hosts failed to create chances, and looked a step slow against a well-drilled Levante side. On the few occasions the away side broke out, meanwhile, Los Blancos looked uneasy. Mbappe did go close after 32 minutes, racing onto Raul Asencio's long ball - but he smashed wide. 

The second half was much better from Arbeloa's side as the introduction of Arda Guler offered more midfield creativity. Mbappe was the first beneficiary when he was dragged down in the box, which allowed him to convert from the penalty spot. Asencio then sealed victory by rising to meet a corner to head home.

There were still some nervy moments when Levante hit on the break, and Madrid weren't exactly fluid. Still, wins matter, and this was three points gained. 

GOAL rates Madrid's players from the Bernabeu...

Thibaut Courtois (7/10):

Didn't really have a save to make, despite Levante's attacking intent in the first half. 

Federico Valverde (5/10):

Deployed at right-back, a position he openly dislikes, and Levante exposed his wing. 

Raul Asencio (6/10):

Took his header wonderfully to make it 2-0 after a poor first half. 

Dean Huijsen (7/10):

The better of the two centre-backs on the day. Composed for the most part.

Alvaro Carreras (6/10):

Played the shielding role and made a lot of selfless runs to open up spaces. 

Aurelien Tchouameni (5/10):

Missed a few tackles and didn't move the ball quickly enough. No point having him and Camavinga in the team against this level of opposition. 

Eduardo Camavinga (5/10):

Misplaced some passes and made some silly fouls. Hooked at half-time after a miserable 45 minutes. 

Jude Bellingham (6/10):

Had a real nightmare in the first half. Gave the ball away loads and played some aimless passes. Much better when the spaces opened up in the second. 

Gonzalo Garcia (6/10):

Deployed on the right of a front three - a rather unfamiliar position for him - and didn't get involved much. 

Kylian Mbappe (8/10):

A bit sloppy in the first half but took his penalty wonderfully in the second. Could have had more goals, too. 

Vinicius Jr (6/10):

Booed relentlessly - and rather unnecessarily - by the Madrid faithful. Sloppy at first but much much more effective when spaces opened up.

Arda Guler (8/10):

His introduction truly changed the game. Assisted the second goal and offered plenty of attacking quality.

Franco Mastantuono (7/10):

Gave Madrid an extra option out wide. A solid shift. 

Dani Ceballos (6/10):

Controlled the tempo more effectively than either starting central midfielder.

David Alaba (N/A):

A late run out. 

Alvaro Arbeloa (6/10):

Went back to the 4-3-3 that Alonso was never able to figure out. Madrid were woeful for the first half and much better in the second. A win? Sure. A good performance? No way.  ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Seattle (-330) has the top-ranked scoring defense in the entire NFL, led by defensive lineman Leonard Williams, and will look to keep the 49ers offense quiet just as they did in their last meeting in the regular season, which Seattle won 13-3. Expect a low-scoring game in this one, and lean under 45.0 (-110) on the total game points.

After losing six-time Pro Bowler George Kittle to a season-ending Achilles rupture, the 49ers (+265) will look to continue their season and reach the NFC championship game. Expect Brock Purdy to spread the wealth all around without the star tightening. Sam Darnold, the Seahawks QB, is also questionable with an oblique injury.

The Celtics (25-15) enter as heavy favorites against the Hawks (20-23), while the total points line is typically in the O/U 238.5 range, setting the stage for both pace and defense angles.

Key player props include Jaylen Brown Over 28.5 points, reflecting his usage and matchup advantage, Derrick White Over 23.5 points, and Nemias Queeta Over 10.5 rebounds, given Boston's need for interior boards.

For Atlanta, Jalen Johnson Over 26.5 points and Nickeil Alexander-Walker Over 18.5 points are popular, while Hawks team assists Over ~21.5can capture their ball-movement tempo. Game props like first-quarter points Over ~57.5 and Celtics margin Over 8.5 reflect expectations of a fast start by Boston, and alternate lines on three-pointers made for both squads offer value depending on how lineups are deployed.

Manchester United host Manchester City in a high-stakes Manchester Derby, with City entering as deserved favorites thanks to superior form and depth. Pep Guardiola's side continues to dominate possession and chance creation, making a City win the most logical angle, while United's inconsistency and defensive lapses remain a concern despite the home-field boost at Old Trafford.

Goals markets are appealing in this fixture—Over 2.5 goals and Both Teams to Score both carry value given City's attacking firepower and United's tendency to find chances in big matches.

Player props also stand out, particularly Erling Haaland anytime goal or shots on target, while Bruno Fernandes shots or goal involvement could appeal if backing a United response. Overall, City to win with goals on the board shapes up as the strongest betting lean in this derby.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Diallo on facing Zverev, a new coaching team & why 'margins are getting smaller'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/diallo-australian-open-2026-feature","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 07:36:01 GMT","

Gabriel Diallo has not practised with or competed against World No. 3 Alexander Zverev, who has been a presence at the top of the ATP Tour since before the Canadian was in college. But the 24-year-old is flying higher than ever and excited to step on the court inside Rod Laver Arena Sunday to take on the two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion.

“I'm very grateful that I'm in this position to play in a Slam, one of the biggest courts against one of the best players in the world. So it's all a bonus,” Diallo told ATPTour.com. “We train hard and we work hard to position ourselves to play in those kind of matches. We start playing tennis, to play those kind of matches. So I'm really excited and looking forward to playing.” 

One year ago, Zverev made the final at Melbourne Park for the first time after reaching the semi-finals on two previous occasions. The German has failed to reach the fourth round just once since 2019.

“He's very consistent. First of all, just from the back and in terms of a performance standpoint, he's been in the Top 10 for I don't know how many years. And then, obviously in terms of his game, he's got a great serve, great backhand, solid forehand,” Diallo said. “So I'm going to have to get creative. I'm going to have to take it to him if I want to give myself some chances to win. At the end of the day, I think for me it's another match, it's another learning experience.”

Diallo is currently doing plenty of learning. He split with longtime coach Martin Laurendeau and began working with Jonas Bjorkman and Johan Ortegren.

“I've got the full Swedish delegation now,” Diallo said, cracking a laugh. “I'm excited to see where that's going to take me, and very grateful for the past five years I had with Marty. We had an amazing run since I was in college, all the way to now. Someone that will always stay very close to me and that has a special place in my heart.”





While Ortegren was also a professional tennis player, Bjorkman stands out for his efforts reaching No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings and No. 1 in doubles.

“It's been very good. He just came to Adelaide, so it was the first time I saw him there. But yeah, so far it's been very good. Learning a lot,” Diallo said. “He has a lot of expertise and as a player, he was where I aspire to be. So just a great opportunity to learn from him and work with him and excited to see where it's going to take me.”

The World No. 1 is on a good path. A year ago he was No. 86 and competing in the Australian Open main draw for the first time. Now Diallo is one of the most dangerous unseeded players in Melbourne, fresh off a season in which he lifted the trophy in ‘s-Hertogenbosch and made his first ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final in Madrid.

“The goal was to finish inside the Top 50, and I managed to accomplish that. I had some very good results. Won my first title, big quarters in the Masters,” Diallo said. “So just [want to] keep building on this, carrying this momentum throughout 2026, keep improving. We flagged the things that I need to improve in order to make the next jump and the details and the margins are getting smaller and smaller, but those are the things that are going to make a big difference.”

From a #NextGenATP showdown in the opening round, to former college standouts and other rising talents, ATPTour.com highlights five ATP Challenger players to watch during the Australian Open.





Rei Sakamoto
The 19-year-old lifted the 2024 boys' singles crown in Melbourne, becoming the first Japanese player to win the junior title at the Australian Open. Since then, the 6'4” (193cm) teenager has made a splash on the ATP Challenger circuit, including a triumph last November on home soil at the Yokohama Challenger, his final tournament of 2025.

The first Japanese teenager to win three Challenger titles, Sakamoto stormed through the Melbourne qualifying draw to make his first major main-draw appearance. He began with an emphatic 6-1, 6-2 win against former World No. 21 Daniel Evans and built upon that momentum, not dropping a set to earn a milestone appearance Down Under. Sakamoto will face fellow 19-year-old Rafael Jodar in the first round.

Rafael Jodar
It will be an entertaining opening-round clash between two emerging talents, Sakamoto and Jodar. Not only is the Spaniard competing in his first major main draw, this past week marked his first attempt at qualifying for Slam — mission accomplished. Jodar's Challenger results have been a key stepping stone to where he is today.

In the second half of the 2025 season, Jodar won three Challenger titles in as many months en route to qualifying for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. On New Year's Eve, the 19-year-old announced that he was turning pro, forgoing his remaining eligibility at the University of Virginia, where he spent two seasons. He began this season with a run to the final at the Canberra Challenger, where he fell to 2025 Jeddah runner-up Alexander Blockx. Jodar is at a career-high No. 150 in the PIF ATP Rankings.You May Also Like: Five ATP Challenger players to watch in 2026

Liam Draxl
The Canadian was one of two players (Emilio Nava) to earn a season-leading 44 match wins at the Challenger level in 2025. Draxl, 24, won on the hard courts of Winnipeg in July and reached six additional finals to cap his career-best year. Now, the former University of Kentucky standout turns his attention to his first major main-draw appearance.

Draxl was nearly out of qualifying when he faced a 3-6, 3-5 deficit against Mackenzie McDonald in the final round. Two points from defeat at 3-5 in the second set, Draxl hammered a backhand pass to finish a thrilling exchange in which the American had an opportunity to put away an overhead. Draxl stormed back to win 3-6, 7-6(2), 6-2, securing his place in the main draw in dramatic fashion. He will start against Damir Dzumhur.

Raphael Collignon
The 23-year-old will look to relive his memories from last year's US Open, where he reached the third round of a Slam for the first time, having defeated 12th seed Casper Ruud in a five-set, three-hour, 30-minute battle along the way. The Belgian faces a tough test in fifth seed Lorenzo Musetti in his Melbourne opener.

At a career-high No. 72 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Collignon reached his second career tour-level quarter-final in Brisbane earlier this month. He is competing in the Australian Open main draw for the first time. Collignon, whose father is a brain surgeon, lifted two Challenger trophies in 2025 (Pau, Monza). 

Patrick Kypson
A seven-time Challenger champion, Kypson was among a six-way tie for the most titles (4) at that level in 2025. The 26-year-old earned a spot in the main draw by winning the USTA's Australian Open Wild Card Challenge last November, in large part helped by his triumphs at the Sioux Falls and Helsinki Challengers.

Competing in Melbourne for the second time (2024) and seeking his first major main-draw win, Kypson begins against Argentine Francisco Comesana.Slam debut incoming 🔜Arthur Gea, Rafael Jodar, Rei Sakamoto, Francesco Maestrelli, Nicolai Budkov Kjaer, Michael Zheng and Liam Draxl punch their ticket to the @AustralianOpen main draw!#ATPChallenger | #AusOpen pic.twitter.com/VHsR4k90H9— ATP Challenger (@ATPChallenger) January 15, 2026

Andre Agassi may have finished his running for the night, but he was still in full analyst mode after sharing the court with fellow ATP No. 1 Club Members Roger Federer and Lleyton Hewitt at the Australian Open on Saturday evening.

Following an entertaining exhibition doubles clash alongside Federer, Hewitt and Patrick Rafter, Agassi spoke with Jim Courier about what made Hewitt and Federer so difficult to face during their time at the top of the game.

“Every No. 1 player in the world brings something so unique to the game,” Agassi said, nodding toward Hewitt. “I watched Lleyton do it. He turned a transition game phenomenally. He turned defence into offense. We saw fast players that stayed on defence.”

Agassi and Hewitt split their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry at 4–4, with all eight meetings coming on hard courts. The American, however, trailed Federer 3–8, and his tone shifted noticeably when reflecting on the Swiss great.

“Then all of a sudden you play this guy Roger Federer and it was like time stood still,” Agassi said. “You hit the ball and it leaves your racquet exactly how you want it, yet he has all the time in the world. You couldn't commit because he could change pace or direction. He could move you north and south, east and west. I knew I was facing the efforts of the next generation.”
Federer went on to spend a record 310 weeks as the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, including 237 consecutively. Hewitt held top spot for 80 weeks, last occupying the position in June 2003, while Agassi spent 101 weeks as the World's No. 1, briefly reclaiming the spot from Hewitt during that era.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Alcaraz, Sinner, Djokovic feature in 10 things to watch at the Australian Open","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/australian-open-2026-scouting-report","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 01:10:56 GMT","

There is no shortage of compelling narratives at this year's Australian Open, where Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic all arrive with history firmly in their sights.

Alcaraz, the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, is bidding for a maiden crown at the hard-court major — a triumph with which he would complete the Career Grand Slam. Two-time defending champion Sinner and record 10-time winner Djokovic stand among a deep field of contenders eager to halt the Spaniard's charge.

ATPTour.com highlights 10 storylines to follow at the 2026 Australian Open.





1) Alcaraz chases Career Grand Slam: Alcaraz has yet to progress beyond the quarter-finals in four previous appearances at the Australian Open, but he has made no secret of his ambition to lift the title in Melbourne. Should he triumph, the World No. 1 will become just the sixth man in the Open Era to win at least one major title at all four Grand Slam tournaments.

2) Can Sinner complete hat-trick? The two-time defending champion is attempting to join Djokovic as the only man in the Open Era to win three straight Australian Open titles. Sinner owns a 22-4 record at the event, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, with his most recent loss coming against Stefanos Tsitsipas in the fourth round in 2023.

A post shared by ATP Tour (@atptour)

3) Djokovic returns to stomping ground:
 After being forced to retire injured from his semi-final against Alexander Zverev last year, Djokovic is back at his most successful major with renewed motivation. The 38-year-old claimed his 101st tour-level title in Athens in November and is chasing a 25th Grand Slam trophy, which would move him clear of Margaret Court on the all-time list.

4) Zverev pushes on in bid for maiden Slam:
A three-time major finalist, Zverev continues to feature prominently in the latter stages of the biggest tournaments, but the elusive breakthrough remains. The German, runner-up to Sinner last year, begins his campaign against powerful Canadian Gabriel Diallo.

5) Resurgent Medvedev:
 Following a strong close to the 2025 season and a title run in Brisbane to open 2026, Daniil Medvedev appears revitalised after managing just one major match win last year. A former World No. 1 and three-time Melbourne finalist, Medvedev could meet longtime rival Zverev in the quarter-finals. He leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 14-8.

6) Aussie hopes on home soil:
At a career-high No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Alex de Minaur spearheads the local charge. The 26-year-old, a competitor at the past two Nitto ATP Finals, is joined in the main draw by fellow Australians Alexei Popyrin, Adam Walton — who opens against Alcaraz — and James Duckworth, while Jason Kubler advanced through qualifying.

7) #NextGen talents take centre stage:
Recent Next Gen ATP Finals champions Learner Tien and Joao Fonseca return as the 25th and 28th seeds, respectively. Tien stunned Medvedev en route to the fourth round last year, while Fonseca claimed a notable win over Andrey Rublev. They are joined by 2025 Jeddah competitors Nicolai Budkov Kjaer, Rafael Jodar, Nishesh Basavareddy and Dino Prizmic, as well as 19-year-old Rei Sakamoto.

8) Wawrinka headlines wild cards:
Stan Wawrinka, who plans to retire at the end of the 2026 season, captured the first of his three major titles in Melbourne in 2014 and returns this year as a wild card. Australian Jordan Thompson also enters via wild card, having not played a tour-level match since October in Shanghai.

9) First-round popcorn clashes:
De Minaur faces an immediate challenge against former Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini. World No. 8 Ben Shelton, a semi-finalist last year, opens against Adelaide finalist Ugo Humbert, while Grigor Dimitrov versus Tomas Machac adds to a trio of must-watch opening-round encounters.

10) Kokkinakis/Kyrgios feature in doubles:
Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool arrive as the top seeds after finishing 2025 by claiming Year-End ATP Doubles No. 1 presented by PIF honours. The doubles field also includes 2022 Australian Open champions Thanasi Kokkinakis and Nick Kyrgios, adding further intrigue to the competition.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Djokovic: 'If I can put puzzle pieces together, I can beat anybody'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/djokovic-australian-open-2026-pre-tournament-press","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 06:47:23 GMT","

Does Novak Djokovic believe he can beat Jannik Sinner or Carlos Alcaraz in best-of-five set matches at the Grand Slams?

Based on the 24-time major winner's pre-Australian Open press conference Saturday, the answer remains a little unclear.

The Serbian took down Alcaraz in the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park just 12 months ago, but then lost to Sinner in the semi-finals of Roland Garros and Wimbledon and Alcaraz at the US Open. After his defeat at Flushing Meadows, he candidly expressed doubt that he could still stay with Sinner or Alcaraz at the majors.

But with a fresh season upon him, Djokovic told media that there's a chance.

“I know that when I'm healthy, when I'm able to put all the pieces of the puzzle together on a given day, I feel like I can beat anybody. If I don't have that self-belief and confidence in myself, I wouldn't be sitting here and talking to you guys or competing,” Djokovic said.

“I understand that Sinner and Alcaraz are playing on a different level right now… but that doesn't mean that nobody else has a chance. So I like my chances always, in any tournament, particularly here.”





Later in his presser, however, the 10-time Australian Open champion, seemed to temper talk of potentially going through both Sinner [in the semi-finals] and top seed Alcaraz [in the final] to take the title. 

“I'm missing a little bit of juice in my legs, to be honest, to be able to compete with these guys at the later stages of a Grand Slam,” said Djokovic, who withdrew from this week's Adelaide International, saying that his body wasn't quite ready to return to competition. “But I'm definitely giving my best as I have in '25, and I think I have done very well and challenged them on their route to the title. 

“I lost three out of four slams against either Sinner or Alcaraz… We know how good they are, and they absolutely deserve to be where they are. They are the dominant forces of the men's tennis at the moment. I'm still trying to be in the mix.”

Djokovic, 38, is attempting to win his 13th major after the age of 30. For context, Pete Sampras won 14 Grand Slams throughout his career.

Fifth-seeded Djokovic opens his 21st Australian Open campaign against Spaniard Pedro Martinez. He is seeded to meet Brandon Nakashima in the third round and Jakub Mensik in the fourth round, which would be a rematch of the 2025 ATP Masters 1000 final in Miami, won by the Czech.

Did You Know?
Information courtesy ITF

Aged 38 years 255 days, Djokovic is bidding to become the oldest player in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam men's singles title and the first man in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam title aged 38 or older. Ken Rosewall is the only man in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam title aged 37 or older, at the 1972 Australian Open. (NB ages calculated at the end of the tournament)

Should he reach the final here, Djokovic will become the 2nd man in the Open Era to reach multiple Grand Slam finals after turning 37, after Rosewall, who contested 3 Grand Slam finals after his 37th birthday. He would also become the 2nd man in the Open Era to reach a Grand Slam final after turning 38, after Rosewall, who contested 2 Grand Slam finals aged 39.

Djokovic is also bidding to win his 13th Grand Slam title since turning 30 and extend his record for most Grand Slam singles titles won after the age of 30 in the Open Era. He claimed sole ownership of the record by winning his 11th Grand Slam title since turning 30 at 2023 Roland Garros, moving ahead of Serena Williams. Djokovic is bidding to win his 5th Australian Open title since turning 30.

Djokovic is bidding to win the title here 18 years after winning his first Grand Slam title here in 2008 and claim the Open Era record for longest gap between first and most-recent Grand Slam singles titles.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","The incredible story of Michael Zheng: Ivy League student competing in the Australian Open","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/zheng-australian-open-2026-feature","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 14:46:59 GMT","

Michael Zheng will take five courses this spring semester at Columbia University in New York, where he is a senior. The 21-year-old is soon to graduate from the Ivy League institution, one of the most prestigious schools in the world.

But even though school begins on 20 January, that will not be his focus this week. Instead, the student-athlete is on the other side of the world competing in a major main draw for the first time at the Australian Open.

“Right now, I'm really excited,” Zheng, a qualifier, told ATPTour.com. “And relieved to get through that and get the chance to play my first main draw.”

A year ago, that was more than improbable. Zheng was the reigning NCAA men's singles champion, but still outside the Top 700 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Yet he has balanced a rigorous education — earning Academic All-American honours as well as the Rafael Osuna National Sportsmanship Award in 2025 — and college tennis with proving he can compete with the best players in the world. 

Zheng has long shown ability, dating back to when his father, Joe, decided to introduce Michael and his older sister by two years, Amy, to the sport at their local high school. Joe, who moved to the United States from China, fell in love with the sport upon his arrival and passed it along to his children.

Growing up in New Jersey, Zheng spent three days a week during middle school training at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, home of the US Open. And by the end of his junior career, the American reached the 2022 Wimbledon boys' singles final, beating Coleman Wong and Martin Landaluce along the way.

“I had some talent, so he wanted to see how far he could take it,” Zheng said of his father. “And now we're here playing my first main draw [of a major]. It's been quite a tournament.”

But it has been an atypical one. Zheng is an active college student who in the coming days has to prepare for psychology courses in the New York winter. Instead, he is heating up in the Australian summer. The humble student does not make a big deal of it, but Ivy League coursework is difficult enough on its own.

""The academic rigour has helped Michael in many ways, especially mentally,” said Howard Endelman, the head coach of men's tennis at Columbia. “The schoolwork is complementary; It allows Michael to focus and develop aspects of his life outside of tennis. Although it might be counter-intuitive, this combination has helped Michael develop as a complete person which has actually helped his tennis.""


According to Zheng, Endelman emphasises this message consistently.
“You learn how to manage your time and in the pressure moments, I think you can manage a little bit better, because you put all that work in and at the same time, you're balancing school,” Zheng said. “I think it just gives you that little bit of a mental edge, that you're doing maybe a little bit more than these other guys, and at the same time, your level is there.”



According to Zheng, Endelman emphasises this message consistently.

“You learn how to manage your time and in the pressure moments, I think you can manage a little bit better, because you put all that work in and at the same time, you're balancing school,” Zheng said. “I think it just gives you that little bit of a mental edge, that you're doing maybe a little bit more than these other guys, and at the same time, your level is there.”





What makes his moment in the spotlight Sunday against Sebastian Korda at Melbourne Park more impressive is how he got there. Not only did he work his way through a tough qualifying draw, but made a big run to earn his place in qualifying in the first place.

In early June, Zheng was still outside the world's Top 700. But a run to the ATP Challenger final in Little Rock began a huge surge, with titles in Chicago, Columbus and Tiburon showing it was no fluke.

""Right after winning the Tiburon Challenger final in October, Michael took a Sunday night red-eye flight so he could take an in-person exam Monday morning in New York City,” Endelman said. “He just takes it all in stride.""

The latter two tournament victories came while Zheng was taking five classes, before successfully defending his NCAA singles crown.

“Definitely not easy. At the same time, I think people tend to overestimate the studies. I think you can make it as hard or as easy as you want it to be,” Zheng, a Psychology major, said. “I'm travelling, missing quite a bit of class, so I'm not going to do anything too crazy, like neuroscience, biology or something like that. But at the same time, you can sign up for whatever classes you want to take.”

Entering college, Zheng had not planned to study psychology, but economics. The 21-year-old has found it interesting, even if he does not believe that there is a firm link between his studies and psychology on the tennis court. 

Zheng's memorable run nearly came to an end in the final round of qualifying against Lukas Klein, against whom he faced a match point in the final-set tie-break. But the Columbia Lion dealt with that pressure the same way he does school: successfully. 

""Nothing seems to bother Michael — on or off the court — especially when things go wrong,” Endelman said. “Michael lost the lead after being up 7/1 and 9/7 in the final-set tiebreaker, then all of a sudden was serving down 9/10.  With no emotion, he calmly goes up to the line and saves match point with an ace wide.""

Although Zheng's tennis career is only beginning, the future is bright both on and off the court for the college standout. But the World No. 174 is not too concerned about what will come with his Psychology degree at the moment.

“I'm not thinking too longterm right now,” Zheng said. “I'm just focussing on seeing how far I can take the tennis and giving 100 per cent focus on that at least.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Arribage/Olivetti clinch Auckland crown","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/adelaide-auckland-2026-doubles-finals","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 01:52:37 GMT","

Theo Arribage and Albano Olivetti captured their maiden tour-level title of the season on Saturday when they earned a 7-6(2), 6-4 victory over Alexander Erler and Robert Galloway in the ASB Classic final in Auckland.

The all-French duo did not drop en route to the final and carried that momentum into the championship match, where they produced a dominant serving performance. They fired 12 aces and won 79 per cent (33/42) of their first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to claim their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Erler and Galloway in one hour and 22 minutes. 

""The good thing is that we are keeping it up, our service games. This week we got broken only once in four matches, which is pretty good,"" Olivetti said. ""We found a way and we are talking a lot about strategy and tactics [which] worked for us.""



The unseeded pair of Arribage and Olivetti had defeated second seeds Francisco Cabral and Lucas Miedler, who won the Brisbane crown last week, in the semi-finals.

“During the match, we stayed positive. We stayed calm. So I think it's the part of the victory,"" Arribage said. We are very happy to win this one. I think it was a very good week for us.""

The victory marked Arribage's third doubles ATP Tour title and Olivetti's fourth. They won their first title as a team last year at the Almaty Open.

Heliovaara/Patten triumph in Adelaide
Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten began their season in style with victory at the Adelaide International. The second seeds overcame Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz 6-3, 6-2 to lift the trophy at the ATP 250 event.

Heliovaara and Patten have now won nine tour-level titles as a team, including major trophies at Wimbledon and the Australian Open. The Finn-British team will next head to Melbourne, where they will aim to defend the title.

“I want to be surprised after every match,” insisted the former world No. 1 as she aims to complete a Career Grand Slam in Melbourne.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 16, 2026 copy_link

Published Jan 16, 2026

MELBOURNE, Australia—Iga Swiatek's Media Day press conference got off to an uncomfortable start at the 2026 Australian Open when a journalist spoiled her projected path to a Career Grand Slam.The former world No. 1 is seeded second in the women's draw and was not happy to learn that both Naomi Osaka and Elena Rybakina landed in her quarter, employing a fairly spectacular eye roll before shutting down the topic entirely.“I'm not looking at the draw,” said Swiatek who, like many players, prefers not to see the full bracket. “So thanks for the heads-up.”“It's not a joke,” she added firmly. “I'm literally not doing that. So please don't spoil it for me. I want to be surprised after every match. No, because I didn't know. That's it.”The six-time Grand Slam champion has no problem going head-to-head with the media, taking umbrage with the premise of a question about her energy levels last summer after a US Open defeat.

Swiatek was nonetheless able to rebound for the very next question, which was about her successful run at the One Point Slam.“It was great,” smiled Swiatek. “I think it was so much fun. Honestly, like, everybody was watching. Like also off the court, everybody said they were so, like, emotional about it, you know?”The reigning Wimbledon champion was able to score wins over ATP players Frances Tiafoe and Flavio Cobolli, outrallying the latter to reach the quarterfinals.“It's fun. It's something new, refreshing. I think this is what tennis sometimes needs, to put the events out like that. Yeah, playing against Flavio was super fun. Honestly, I like to play against guys. I already could do that in some mixed doubles. Here, I felt like I need to really push him. When he would have a chance to open the court, I would be nowhere there.“Half of the players I think took it seriously; half of them didn't. I was, like, warming up, I was ready. I really wanted to play a backhand cross-court rally with Frances, but didn't get a chance!”

At 24 years old Swiatek, who began the year with a win for Poland at the United Cup, is part of a trio that includes Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner of active players with victories at three of the four major tournaments. But that's a narrative Swiatek insists she's not thinking too much about.“I think you guys are thinking more about it,” she said through another awkward—but decidedly less tense—exchange. “Since the beginning of the year, there are many people coming to me and talking to me about it. I'm really just focusing on, like, day-by-day work. This is how it's always been for me. This is how I actually was able to achieve the success that I already have, just focusing really on grinding, match by match.Winning a Grand Slam is tough. Like a lot of things have to come together to do that. Yeah, it's a tough tournament. So, I have, like, no expectations. Obviously, it would be a dream come true. This is not, like, my clear goal that I wake up with. I'm thinking more about how I want to play, what I want to improve, like, day by day.”That day by day process will begin on Monday against Yuan Yue—an opponent about whom Swiatek will no doubt be duly informed.

MELBOURNE, Australia—After a year like Amanda Anisimova's, few would be eager to change a thing.The 24-year-old is fresh off a breakthrough season, one in which she captured two WTA 1000 titles and reached two Grand Slam finals, and arrives Down Under at a career-high ranking of No. 4.When you're that close to the top, it's all about small tweaks, and Anisimova opted to make just one before the first major of the season.“Well, it's like pretty personal,” Anisimova joked of her decision to go back to blonde after a winning season as a brunette.

“So, like, I would go dark and I really liked it. But then after like a month it would look really bad. Either my roots would grow out or it would look orange. Didn't really suit me.“I was just tired of, yeah, the maintenance. I'm someone who likes to keep changing things up. So I wouldn't be surprised if I went dark again in a year. We'll see how it goes.”So far, Anisimova hasn't seen a major dip in form: her 2026 debut came at the Brisbane International, where she won a round but fell to eventual finalist Marta Kostyuk. Despite ending the season with plenty of momentum—culminating with a semifinal finish at the WTA Finals—the perennially unbothered New Jersey native was relieved for the chance to slow down and retool in the off-season.“It's good to have a chunk of time when you're just able to be at home and relax a bit,” she said dryly of her “productive” time off. “I think that's also really healthy for us.“I just tried to understand what I wanted to work on with the five weeks I had, and how we were going to get the most out of the training. I made sure to not take my time at home for granted. Every single day I really tried to appreciate just the time that I had because it was pretty short.”

In the same quarter of the draw as fellow Americans Jessica Pegula and Madison Keys—the latter serving as defending champion—Anisimova could face a stern test as early as the third round against 2020 winner Sofia Kenin, but will aim to draw from her own Grand Slam experience to go far at the only major tournament where she is yet to reach the semifinals.“Just being in those positions for the first time, I think the second time around is always going to be a little easier. At least I have been in those spots that I kind of know what to expect.“At the same time, it's a new Grand Slam. I'm just really taking it one match at a time. Yeah, everyone is going to be very difficult to face here, but I'm looking forward to it.”Poised to prove whether blondes indeed have more fun, Anisimova will play her first round against Switzerland's Simona Waltert.

Andreeva first borrowed the catchphrase from Snoop Dogg, and brought it back after a decisive win over Victoria Mboko on Saturday.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 17, 2026 copy_link

Published Jan 17, 2026

Fresh off winning her first title of the 2026 season, Mirra Andreeva unveiled a stylish surprise at the Adelaide International, donning a sweatshirt with what has become her signature post-win catchphrase, “I would like to thank myself.”Andreeva didn't directly acknowledge the sweatshirt after defeating Victoria Mboko in Saturday's final, but she jokingly leaned into the theme all the same in her victory speech.“I guess my team comes next,” she said after thanking her opponent and the tournament's staff and sponsors and physios. “But I do feel like it was all me. I don't know what I can say. I've been practicing a lot. I've been working, sweating and I don't even know why you're here, honestly!”The 18-year-old explained the genesis of the catchphrase in her post-match press conference.

The 18-year-old explained the genesis of the catchphrase in her post-match press conference.

“Well, it started when I first said that sentence,” she said. “It was when I won my first tournament in Romania, in Iasi, 250 WTA tournament. Since then, every time I win and I get to have a speech, I get to have, I get to say something on the court after I win, I always say thanks to myself.“But it's not my thing. I stole it from Snoop Dogg. Because I saw him saying that on some kind of interview when he said, ""I want to thank me."" And then his song was playing on the background. So I stole it from him.“Since then, like people love that, when I say that thing. I said it in Dubai. I said it in Indian Wells. And then, yeah, after that it kind of became the thing that I say on the speech.”Andreeva hadn't had occasion to bring back the catchphrase since Indian Wells, having not reached a final since last March. The teenager ended that drought in style this week in Adelaide, breezing through the field without dropping a set—culminating with a 6-3, 6-1 win over a talented, but physically compromised Mboko.

“Of course, it's a great preparation to go into Melbourne and to play in the Australian Open,” said Andreeva, who will be the eighth seed at the first Grand Slam tournament of the season. “You know, of course it gives me a lot of confidence to see myself play well on the court, and it's just, in two days basically I'm going to play another match in Melbourne.“I just have to bring the same level of my game and the same mindset into Melbourne. I think I'm going to play well there as well. Obviously, I feel more confident after this win. Also winning a title is super special to me as well. So, yeah, I just have to kind of, maybe today and tomorrow I relax a little bit, we practice, and then we have to get to work again.”To earn more gratitude, Andreeva will get to work against Donna Vekic in the first round of the Australian Open, the pair scheduled to face off on Margaret Court Arena Monday evening.

How drivers will adapt in 2026

Lawrence Barretto's new F1 TV series Off The Grid sees him spending time with the great and the good of the F1 paddock away from the racetrack. In the third episode, he travels to Geneva to meet Haas driver Esteban Ocon.

When a Formula 1 driver arrives at a racetrack, he selects full race mode and puts everything else out of his mind to focus on the day job. Over the course of the last decade covering the sport, that's usually the mode they're engaged in when I get to talk to them through my role as an interviewer for F1. But for a change of pace and as part of an exclusive new series, I headed Off The Grid to hang out with the sport's elite racers away from the office.

In the third and final episode of this series, Grand Prix winner Esteban Ocon invited me to Geneva, the place he now calls home, to join him on a training day. The Frenchman, who like his rivals Oscar Piastri and Pierre Gasly in the opening two episodes gave up one of his personal days to take part in filming (rather than via mandatory team media or commercial time), talks expansively about his family selling their home to fund his career, his relationship with fellow French racer Pierre Gasly, his rivalry with Sergio Perez, the pain he felt as Manor went under and his new chapter with American squad Haas.

Esteban Ocon grew up surrounded by cars, as he would spend his days watching – and, when he was old enough, helping – his mechanic Dad tinker with machines. When Sundays came, he was glued to the TV watching Formula 1, so it's perhaps not surprising he quickly zero-ed in on a career in motorsports.

""I was watching F1 on a Sunday, I was shocked but also fascinated at the same time,"" says Ocon, when we chat in one of the quaint corners of his stunning training base 321 Perform. ""The love for the sport grew from there. At the same time, I got a taste of karting. I wanted to only drive all the time. Many kids say I want to become an astronaut or footballer. For me, it's always been Formula 1 driver and it's never changed since I first talked about it.""

Racing is obviously not cheap – and the Ocons weren't wealthy, but his family believed in him to such an extent that they opted to sell their home and move into a caravan to fund his go-karting career. How did he feel when his Dad told him they were going all in on him?

""Dad said, 'It's now or never'. It was an immense amount of pressure. I didn't have a normal childhood, but we were living [in the caravan] with my mum and dad and my dog. Every day I woke up with a different scenery. I remember one day opening the door and it was a view of the sea and we were in Monaco. It was amazing. That moment will stick with me forever.""

Ocon and his family clocked up tens of thousands of kilometres travelling to various karting meets across Europe – and once there, he'd encounter some of the best karters in the world, including Gasly, whom he had known since he was little because they grew up in Normandy and who had used his kart to get a first taste of motorsport.

""I was on that little go-kart track in Anneville, and I was practising for the regional championships that were coming up,"" says Ocon. ""Pierre was playing football and my Dad said to him quit these shoes and jump in Esteban's go-kart. The following week, Pierre got a go-kart as well. We were driving together – I was showing him the line first and then we were racing together.""

That relationship fractured as they made their way through the lower racing categories – ""Pierre was my best friend when I was younger,"" he says. ""Then we grew up and things changed a little bit"" – but there was a wholesome moment in Brazil in 2024 when they unexpectedly shared the podium racing for French team Alpine.

""Two kids from Normandy racing for a brand from Normandy,"" he says.  ""Who would have thought? This world has a billion people, we're just two little guys from France – it's quite crazy. That moment meant the whole world for us. The only thing I would love too is for us to share even more podiums in the future.""

The Frenchman returned from that race to find a large image of him hoisting the trophy for P2 aloft in his apartment. It was a gift from his girlfriend Flavy – and one of the many mementos he keeps on display in the house, which range from a Spiderman book Daniel Ricciardo gave him as a secret Santa present, which sits on his coffee table, to a handmade steering wheel from a fan, which has working clutch paddles. I had a little mishap with a red-coloured drink, which you'll see in the episode, but can report none of these items were damaged!

Ocon may never have got to F1, though, as funds started to dry up when he made it into single-seaters despite his success in karting. So he took a punt when he had the chance to meet now Mercedes boss Toto Wolff. ""I asked if he could help me for the future,"" says Ocon. ""He was my last chance, my last hope. If he was saying there were no options, the whole dream would have been gone. But he called back and said, 'You are going to race with ART in GP3 and if you succeed in that one, we take you in the [Mercedes] programme'.""

He did succeed, winning the GP3 title in 2015. Wolff was there, standing under the podium to congratulate his soon-to-be newest member of the Mercedes family. Then in the summer of 2016, he gave Ocon a call and offered him the thing the Frenchman had a dreamed of – a shot in F1 with the Manor team when the campaign resumed at Belgium's Spa-Francorchamps track.

""I remember receiving the call when I was on holiday with friends,"" he says. ""I had to go straight away to do a seat fit at Manor to join the grid in Spa. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. We were having a drink – I don't drink alcohol, I was having a coke or something – and I remember looking at the TV in the bar and seeing myself on the news. And I was like, 'Oh, that's me!' People were talking about me on live TV. I didn't believe it. It was pretty nuts!""

He came close to scoring a point in Brazil, in what was one of the slowest cars on track, but faded in the closing stages to end up 12th. He spent much of the race battling with Sauber's Felipe Nasr, who scrapped to ninth to score two points and hoist the Swiss team above Manor in the championship. That had big repercussions for the minnows in terms of prize money as it left them last in the standings – with the team ultimately going into administration.

While Ocon's form would be good enough to get him a seat at midfielders Force India for the following season, he took Manor's demise hard. ""We didn't succeed and the team died at the end of the year,"" he says. ""If I scored more points than that Sauber car, maybe it would have been a different outcome, keep the team alive for the following season. I felt that it was almost my fault. That was very tough. I moved on from them but there were fantastic people working in this team and it was tough to see this team went unfortunately.""

Ocon enjoyed an impressive first full season in F1 with Force India – but while he and team mate Perez scored consistently to help the team finish a superb fourth, they also gave their bosses some big headaches with multiple clashes on track. ""It was a lot of pressure,"" says Ocon.

""I was racing against someone who was very experienced, he was a consistent scorer in the midfield, probably the most consistency. I started on the backfoot in the first race but I caught up well and then we were racing very closely. There were moments where I did mistakes, there were moments when I don't feel it was necessarily my fault.""

He adds: ""I was very young, I was inexperienced, I wanted to push hard and show people I what I was capable off. At the time we were just racing hard and trying to race as best we can, and that's also why we got so many points that year because we were racing very well together.""

""These kinds of moments shouldn't have happened. It cost the team points. I've made mistakes over my career, and thing I shouldn't have done in racing, but that's how you learn from it. We all make mistakes but it's how you overcome those. That's the way I saw racing back then, the track was what matters the most.

""Still I believe the track is what matters the most, but things could have happened in a different way. With how much respect I had for Checo at the time, and I still have now, I would have preferred things to go in a different way. We finished with a very good championship position for the team with P4, and a top 10 finish in my first full season. It was solid.""

After a year on the bench working as a reserve for Mercedes, Ocon reclaimed his spot on the grid with Renault – which ultimately became Alpine and yielded the machine that gave him his first, and as yet only, Grand Prix win. We downloaded the final lap of the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2021 when he triumphed onto a tablet so he could enjoy reliving it mid-interview.

""When I crossed the line, it meant the whole world to me, to all the people who were working so hard for it,"" he says, a beaming smile etched across his face – along with a few fist pumps in the air – while he watches. ""All we did through all my life was worth it just for that moment. It was a beautiful moment.""

Ocon spent five years with the Enstone-based team from 2020, but as he approached the end of that period, things started to get challenging and he began considering his future – and ultimately left the team one race early, missing the chance to complete 2024 in Abu Dhabi. ""At the beginning of 2024, and even at the end of 2023, it was clear the vision I had for the future and how we were moving forward with the team was not matching what I wanted,"" he says.

""I didn't want to let anyone down. I gave 120% every single time I was behind the wheel of that car. Unfortunately it didn't end up the way I wanted. I had prepared a special helmet for my last race, I had planned to go and visit the team, but I didn't get that option.""

Ocon started afresh at Haas last year, linking up with boss Ayao Komatsu who engineered him in his first-ever Formula 1 test when he did a session with Lotus - with his ambitions laser-focused on adding to his win tally and fighting for a championship in the future. ""The best option and how it was presented to me, was to go to Haas. Ayao is a very straightforward person. He has the biggest sense of competing that I have ever seen out of anyone. He doesn't want to lose.

""The way he presented me the straightforward plan, what he is going to build for the team, and what he has already built now. It was for me the best option. I want to be racing and winning in the future. I will give everything until I manage to secure what I want. And if I don't manage to win, I will have given everything, no regrets.""

Film Editor


Paramount is keeping May spooky, and will release the next Paranormal Activity movie on May 21, 2027.


	The untitled feature is produced by franchise newcomer James Wan and directed by Ian Tuason, with plot details kept under wraps. 




	This will be the eighth film in the franchise that began life with Oren Peli's ultra low-budget, 2007 film that grossed $194.2 million and is considered one of the most profitable movies of all time. Originally shot for just $15,000, Jason Blum discovered the feature and injected additional funds into the film before releasing it and turning it into a sleeper hit that helped popularize the found footage genre.

	Blum will produce for his and Wan's Blumhouse-Atomic Monster, while Peli produces for his Solana Films. Paramount is co-producing and co-financing with Blumhouse-Atomic Monster.

	May has become a surprise strong month for scares, with New Line's Final Destination: Bloodlines earning $315.9 million globally after opening May 16 last year. This year, Focus Features has the Toronto sensation Obsession bowing May 15.


	In addition to the original film, the Paranormal franchise entries include Paranormal Activity 2 (2010), Paranormal Activity 3 (2011), Paranormal Activity 4 (2012), The Marked Ones (2014), The Ghost Dimension (2015), and Next of Kin (2021). In all, they have grossed a combined $900 million globally.

	











	“I've been a huge admirer of Paranormal Activity since the brilliant first movie, with its creeping slow burn and subtle ability to make the unseen terrifying. I'm looking forward to expanding on its legacy and helping shape the next evolution of this scary found-footage franchise,” Wan last month when the film was announced.

Winfrey and Gayle King shared wisdom, jokes and more during an appearance at New York's 92Y on Tuesday. Winfrey drew cheers when she copped to emerging as a winning drinker during Santa Barbara's Fiesta.


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	In a mostly earnest, insightful and educational conversation about health, food noise, GLP-1s and the dangers of not recognizing obesity as a disease, Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King delivered some moments of levity as only best friends can do during a special appearance at 92nd Street Y. 


	The two appeared at New York's cultural and community center Tuesday with King acting as moderator for a conversation that featured Winfrey and Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff discussing their new book, Enough: Your Health, Your Weight and What It's Like to Be Free. As King noted at the top of the hourlong chat, 2026 marks a milestone 50th anniversary of meeting as friends in Baltimore, Maryland back in 1976. “We were 21 and 22, now we're 71 and 71. [Oprah] is turning 72 soon.”

	Winfrey, whose birthday is Jan. 29, drew laughs, cheers and gasps when she revealed just how many shots she downed in order to win a drinking contest in Santa Barbara, not far from her estate in Montecito. The topic of conversation came up after King recalled being at a Golden Globes party last weekend when she asked the bartender for a Shirley Temple. “The person next to me said, ‘Seriously?' I go, ‘Seriously with extra cherries.' I just don't drink but you don't drink now either.”

	Winfrey confirmed that she's off the sauce even though she “used to be a tequila girl.” King then prodded her to cite the number of shots she downed in one sitting. “There's something in Santa Barbara called the Fiesta festival. People are out in the streets, and you're drinking and having a good time. That's the whole point. One night we had a drinking contest and I won with 17 shots,” Winfrey confirmed. While she didn't name names of who she drank under the table, King did have more to say: “Don't applaud that. That's terrible.” 

	











	King praised her best friend at other times during the revelatory chat. “This is the most open and honest conversation I've ever heard her have about her weight, which, by the way, is nobody's business,” King said of Winfrey, who generated countless headlines when she revealed she turned to GLP-1s to help with a nearly lifelong battle with obesity.  


	“The bottom line is this, no amount of fame, wealth, success, attention can substitute for your biology,” Winfrey said. “I'm here now telling you there is a pill. There are medications. You can opt to use them or not use them. If you don't use them or don't want to use them, that's really fine. But just know that the struggle doesn't have to be the struggle that you've had, and if you are going to choose to lose weight by eating healthily and working out and the weight comes back, understand why it always comes back.”


	Winfrey's movie career came up when she recalled the promotional cycle for Jonathan Demme's 1998 film in which she starred opposite Danny Glover. “I was promoting this movie, Beloved, which y'all did not go to see. One person went to see it in this room,” she said jokingly. “Anna Wintour wanted to do a cover. I remember just as she was walking out, she goes, ‘You know, you have to lose 20 pounds.' I said, ‘OK, I'm gonna do it.' And I felt really great losing that 20 pounds. I'm telling you, when they brought me the first Polaroid of that Vogue cover, I cried. I cried because I thought the very idea that somebody who had suffered so much from all the weight issues would be on the cover of Vogue.”

	











	King said she still recalled the cover line: “A Major Movie, An Amazing Makeover.”

The pair will head to France for filming on the HBO series.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


HBO has booked two more guests for the fourth season of The White Lotus.


Steve Coogan and Caleb Jonte Edwards have joined the show for the coming season, which is set to film in France. As with most things related to The White Lotus, details of who they'll be playing are being kept quiet. Series creator Mike White is currently writing the new season.




	Coogan and Edwards are the third and fourth members of the cast for the coming season, joining Alexander Ludwig and AJ Michalka.

	Coogan is best known for his long-running Alan Partridge character; he's played the hapless British TV presenter in several series dating back to the 1990s. He's also a two-time Oscar nominee as a writer and producer of Philomena; his other credits include The Trip films and TV series with Rob Brydon, In the Loop and voice work in the Despicable Me movies.

	











	Edwards is a relative newcomer to the business; he appeared in an episode of the Australian drama series Black Snow last year and a short film called The Man and the Woman.


	HBO confirmed in November that season four of The White Lotus will take place in France. A hotel in Saint-Tropez, the Château de la Messardière, will be the primary location for the season, with shooting in other parts of France also likely.


	White writes and directs The White Lotus and executive produces with David Bernad and Mark Kamine.

	











	Coogan is repped by CAA and Independent Talent Group. Edwards is repped by Echo Lake Entertainment and Eaton Management.

Billboard ranks every song from the boy band's cinematic, vampire-inspired EP.


													By
												

	Jeff Benjamin



	As a tightly staged concept album, THE SIN : VANISH turns ENHYPEN‘s long-running vampire mythos into a serialized listening experience akin to a podcast or audiobook — the kind you can't turn off.


	Officially described as a “mystery-show” style album, the boy band's latest interweaves four narrated chapters (delivered in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese via the EP's four different language versions), a skit (also delivered in each version's native tongue), and six fresh K-pop songs that all act as connective pieces to one larger, immersive narrative — a major break from the typical collection of potential hit singles released for most mini albums. The record is crafted to be consumed from start to finish, with the narrations advancing the plot and the songs bringing a range of emotional highs and lows. Still, for the purpose of this review, we'll stick to reviewing each track from the English version of the album on its own individual merit.


	While ENHYPEN utilized albums to share their larger artistic universe since BORDER : DAY ONE in 2020, the experimental elements of this project expand their commitment to storytelling. ENHYPEN's longtime main producer ARMADILLO has his hand in nearly every track and keeps the group's core ethos intact, VANISH's contributions from unexpected musical greats like Korean hip-hop legend GAEKO and indie-rock enchantress So!YoON! are welcome creative endeavours. Meanwhile, members like JAKE hit new artistic heights, earning producing credits on two tracks, with HEESEUNG co-writing on one of them.


	From new single “Knife” to tracks that dip into R&B, Latin, electronica, hip-hop, and beyond, check out Billboard‘s examination of ENHYPEN's THE SIN : VANISH experience with a tracks-ranked review below.


Produced By: CA$HCOW


Written By: Kim Suji (lalala studio), HYBE


	The storytelling aspect is the central element of THE SIN : VANISH with several skits and interludes continuing the overarching vampire mythology that's anchored the ENHYPEN universe since debut. “Witnesses” is the weakest of the bunch with an assortment of speakers furthering the vampire lore. A little musical production added behind the voices, as well as more gripping or visceral testimonies, all could have enhanced the section, but “Witnesses” ultimately feels awkwardly out of place (especially the English version) in such an immersive listening experience.


Produced By: ARMADILLO, CA$HCOW


Written By: ARMADILLO, CA$HCOW, RANGA, Kim Suji (lalalastudio), HYBE


	“The Fugitives” is another narration interlude, opening with 30 seconds of euphoric electro-pop-rock production that we'd love to hear as a song all its own one day. The narrator for the English version of the track seems to stumble over some words here, which is unfortunate when professional actors and singers were enlisted for the other language versions (actor Park Jeong-min narrates the album's original Korean version, singer Lars Huang handles the Chinese version and actor Kenjiro Tsuda narrates the Japanese version) but the additional musical elements uplift it into something sonically special.


Produced By: ARMADILLO, JAKE (Additional Production by Rence, Lukas Costas)


Written By: ARMADILLO, JAKE, Rence, Lukas Costas, Kim Suji (lalala studio), HYBE


	Just as the album closes in a cinematic style, THE SIN : VANISH also opens in an equally intriguing way with what sounds like a crackly, vintage record playing simple piano lines to back the booming-voiced narrator. “Fate, at times, leads us down a treacherous path from which there is no turning back,” he opens in a stentorian delivery, continuing, “The story begins one night with a sudden disappearance of a couple” before the beat switches up into a heavier hip-hop beat dripping with 808s.


	ENHYPEN member JAKE co-produced and co-wrote this track, with THE SIN : VANISH marking his first time producing for the group (but not the only track he'll take part in!) and confirming the group's DNA is live from the opening notes of the record.


Produced By: ARMADILLO, CA$HCOW


Written By: ARMADILLO, CA$HCOW, Kim Suji (lalala studio), HYBE


	“The Beyond” closes things with a moving score of cinematic sounds, bringing a somber yet peaceful mix of piano chords and buzzing, William Orbit–esque electronica.


	With the final lines of narration, it's clear that THE SIN : VANISH is just the beginning of yet another exciting era for ENHYPEN and the boys aren't planning to slow down anytime soon: “Like the slow dawn breaking across the horizon, what fate awaits them? The story begins to unfold in an entirely new direction.”


Produced By: ARMADILLO, CA$HCOW, RANGA


Written By: ARMADILLO, CA$HCOW, RANGA, Kim Suji (lalala studio)


	Warm electronica pulses through another skit that acts almost like an affirmation-meets-ad break in the album. A pleasant female voice dotes: “The voice you've been searching for, may already be inside you. The answer you've been waiting for, now, coming from the closest of places.” Which sounds lovely and almost par for the course when it comes to K-pop positivity mantras.


	But then she continues, in a borderline cyborg-like affability: “Don't miss it — the voice keychain plush that sent shockwaves through vampire society. Claim yours now at vampirenow-dot-live.” That final phrase leading the listener to ENHYPEN's vampire.live that truly brings the album's story to life with its own immersive news site selling seven adorable plushies, while covering the “vampires ‘unprecedented escape'” through faux articles and breaking-news contents like “Vampire Sightings Reported” as well as “Exclusive CCTV Footage Captured of a Struggle With Vampire Pursuit Unit.” Notes on K-Pop called it “one of the highest-level examples” of transmedia in an interview with ENHYPEN's BELIFT LAB, who shared the group's “experimental approach doesn't end with our seventh mini album.” 


	Mixing music, media, and commerce into a single album track makes “The Voice” wholly fascinating and a larger statement on ENHYPEN and HYBE's unique approach to storytelling.


Produced By: Thom Bridges, “hitman” bang, ARMADILLO, BEAM, SkipOnDaBeat


Written By: Thom Bridges, Beau Nox, Marcus “MarcLo” Lomax, “hitman” bang, ARMADILLO, BEAM, SkipOnDaBeat, Gaeko


	This B-side track is another example of ENHYPEN mixing up their musical inspirations and is unlike anything they've put out before. Opting for a minimalist production, “Big Girls Don't Cry” lets new vocal textures and deliveries from the guys take the spotlight. From the first verse, JAKE sounds more confident than ever while HEESEUNG showcases his versatility by easily flipping from a suave, breathy approach on the chorus to a loose and rowdy “Ah woo!” head-voice howl by the second verse. Meanwhile, youngest member NI-KI sounds more mature than ever, with the 20-year-old's baritone delivering a different kind of weight even when he's calling the listener “cutie.”


	But at 1:59, “Big Girls Don't Cry” is the only song on the EP under two minutes, which leaves more to be desired and makes us wonder if a remix might soon surface — perhaps to tell the female perspective and give the track a next-generation take on Fergie‘s Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 of the same name.


Produced By: dwilly


Written By: dwilly, Gray Hawken, CASTLE, Kim Suji (lalala studio), Peridot, ARMADILLO, Jang Jung Won (Jamfactory), Jellybean (153/Joombas), Na Jeongah (153/Joombas), Rizin (153/Joombas), Kelbyul (153/Joombas), Wuhyun Park


	Despite opening with a sample of a woman announcing — rather aggressively — “Empty out those pockets, baby, you know I ain't messing with no broke man,” this track quickly transforms into one of ENHYPEN's breeziest tracks. With a subtle electric pulse within the sunny synths and airy atmosphere, “Lost Island” leaves the listener with a super-sweet takeaway message as our vampire hunks coo, “Baby, all the quarters, nickels and dimes… / There's nothing more precious than time with you.” 


Produced By: Couros, Luis Salazar


Written By: Couros, Luis Salazar, Charlotte Grace Victoria Lee, KIDDO, Peridot, ARMADILLO, Park Sang Yoo(153/Joombas), Wuhyun Park, danke, Rizin(153/Joombas), Kelbyul(153/Joombas), Mun Yeo Reum (Jamfactory), Mia(153/Joombas), Kim Suji (lalala studio), Ellie Suh(153/Joombas), YEONBORA(153/Joombas)


	With Latin-tinged rhythms speckling the alternative-dance track, the septet blends staccato rap-singing with shining falsettos — the latter often stealing the moment as we get to hear HEESEUNG, JAKE, JAY, and SUNGHOON all croon the smoothest they've ever sounded over the track's two pre-choruses.


	Despite the intricacies and inventiveness of the vocal performance and production, spelling out “S-T-E-A-L-E-R” in the choruses feels like a small stylistic compromise for catchiness that will certainly get fans shouting at concerts, ultimately making up one of VANISH‘s most enchanting tracks.


Produced By: Grant Boutin, Connor McDonough, Riley McDonough, “hitman” bang, ARMADILLO


Written By: Grant Boutin, Connor McDonough, Riley McDonough, Jake Torrey, “hitman” bang, ARMADILLO, Gaeko, Supreme Boi, gxxdkelvin


	“Knife” is a hard, high-impact single seemingly built for stage domination: trap-forward beats, serrated synths and the chant-like “it's a knife!” refrain kicking off the track all make it immediately hooky. To compete with the commanding, critically acclaimed gems that make up past ENHYPEN singles, “Knife” delivers an immediate urgency by opening with its catchy chorus, while also boasting the addition of lyrics penned by Korean hip-hop legend GAEKO of Dynamicduo.


	While fans have slowly watched the ENHYPEN guys grow into adults through these past almost six years since first being introduced on the I-Land competition series in 2020, “Knife” can effectively bridge the gap to those who maybe haven't been watching the kids so closely with a musical cut that oozes with an arena-sized statement of confidence and self-actualization.


Produced By: ARMADILLO, JAKE, CA$HCOW, Pink Slip


Written By: ARMADILLO, JAKE, CA$HCOW, Kyle Buckley, Anthony Watts, HEESEUNG, DBLV (CHILLER), Chaewoo Kang (wavecloud), HYUNG GEUN (PNP), Cha Yu Bin, Jo Inho (lalala studio), Cho Yun Kyoung, Kyung Seung Wan


	As JAKE's first official self-composed ENHYPEN song — with lyrics co-penned with HEESEUNG — “Sleep Tight” underscores the brilliance that comes from an artist knowing themselves. With mature restraint throughout, the R&B cut lets JAKE and SUNOO's vocals shine while elongating the final syllable of “tonight,” turning a relatively simplistic, repetitive hook into the emotional and musical climax.


	Expertly crafted to make even the simplest of moments stand out, “Sleep Tight” feels like a musical milestone for JAKE, who is known to love the R&B-pop stylings of Drake and Justin Bieber, and has found a way to incorporate them into ENHYPEN's sonic world. With HEESEUNG's lyrical contributions, the track feels intimate in a way that only groups most comfortable with themselves can pull off, delivering a love letter to fans and being equally accessible to any listener.


Produced By: Pat Morrissey


Written By: Pat Morrissey, Micah Premnath, Grant Averill, David Charles Fischer, Kim Suji (lalala studio), ARMADILLO, Peridot, Cho Yun Kyoung, KIM INHYEONG, Youra (Full8loom), Im Suran (lalala studio), Park Sang Yoo (153/Joombas)) 


	Smoky and scuzzy in all the right ways, “No Way Back” is a dramatic, alternative-R&B piece that builds from a whispered opening into a dreamily tense climax. Featuring the lead singer of Korean indie rock band SE SO NEON, So!YoON! melds her otherworldly vocals with ENHYPEN's falsettos to create an uncanny, perfect musical match made clear from the first time she blends with JUNGWON on the first chorus. 


	While it can be tough to find one voice to blend with a seven-member boy band, the collaboration feels incredibly organic after ENHYPEN has teamed up with the likes of JVKE, YEONJUN of TXT, Ava Max, Flo Rida, and Bella Thorne. On “No Way Back,” So!YoON! feels like a kindred (dark) spirit with the ENHYPEN guys on the haunting track with lyrics of lovers who realize there is truly “no way back now.”


	Like a majority of the songs on THE SIN : VANISH, “No Way Back” feels like it couldn't have existed if ENHYPEN had not grown into the artists they are today. It's not a made-for-radio smash a la “Bite Me,” “Sweet Venom” or even VANISH single “Knife,” but pulls in listeners with its waves of gloss and grit, swaying through different textures, feelings and vibrations for a stirring experience that will resonate long after first listen.

Williams made his catwalk model debut in Milan.

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


Heated Rivalry star Hudson Williams made his catwalk model debut Friday (Jan. 16), opening the Dsquared2 fall 2026 runway show in Milan to an A.I. reworking of Carly Simon's “Let the River Run.”


	Ahead of the 2026 Winter Olympics — which are taking place in both Milan and Cortina, Italy, starting next month — the Dsquared2 presentation was themed around winter sports and closed the first day of Milan Fashion Week Men's Fall/Winter 2026.


	The soundtrack of the 15-minute runway show largely consisted of a mash-up of reworkings of “Let the River Run,” with the opening two minutes scored by an orchestral-rock interpretation of the Academy Award-winning song. On streaming services, the song is credited as “Running on the Water” and is billed to such artist names as Kradex (on Apple Music) or Da Soul Orchestra (on YouTube and Deezer). Notably, on Deezer, the track carries an “AI-generated content” label, which indicates the release is “detected as AI-generated” by the service. Further, on Da Soul Orchestra's YouTube channel, the act's bio notes “we use AI technology to rework iconic tracks in fresh styles.”

	











	Simon's “Let the River Run” was written for the 1988 film Working Girl, starring Harrison Ford, Sigourney Weaver and Melanie Griffith. The film's opening sequence and end credits are soundtracked by “Let the River Run.” The track would go on to win Simon the Oscar for best original song and the Grammy Award for best song written specifically for a motion picture or television. The single climbed to No. 49 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 11 on the Adult Contemporary airplay chart.




	Milan Fashion Week continues through Jan. 20. Could Williams' Heated Rivalry co-star Connor Storrie hit the fashion slopes in Milan? W magazine noted rumblings of Storrie possibly making his runway debut for Dolce & Gabbana on Saturday, but the outlet said the actor's publicists denied the rumor.

Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	This week's Friday Music Guide brought a trio of albums and a trio of songs that Billboard editors will have in our headphones all weekend — but which of the half-dozen selections is your favorite new music of the week?


	Starting with the albums, we had the long-awaited A$AP Rocky project Don't Be Dumb — his first album since 2018's Testing. We heard lead singles “Punk Rocky” and “Helicopter” first, but Friday's (Jan. 16) release brought 15 tracks on the standard album plus two digital bonuses.

	











ENHYPEN (Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, Jungwon and Ni-Ki) dropped the 11-track EP The Sin: Vanish on Friday, highlighted by lead single “Knife.” The vampire-themed release is the first in the seven-member K-pop group's expected The Sin series.


	Finally, Madison Beer put out her third album locket, which follows 2023's Silence Between Songs. We all know the 2024-released single “Make You Mine” — a top 10 hit on Billboard‘s Pop Airplay chart — and the album was also preceded by the songs “Yes Baby” and “Bittersweet” (Beer's first Billboard Hot 100 hit).


	On the song front, we got new tunes from Nigerian superstars Wizkid and Asake (“Jogodo”), country crooner Megan Moroney (“Wish I Didn't”) and indie-pop singer/songwriter Mitski (“Where's My Phone?”).

	











	But which was your favorite of the week? Below, you can vote for one of our half-dozen Friday Music Guide selections or write in your own in our poll. We'll close the poll on Sunday and share the results so fans can see which album or song wears the weekly crown.

	Iranian director Jafar Panahi kicked off the 38th European Film Awards in Berlin on Saturday with an impassioned plea asking the world not to remain silent in the wake of the massacre unfolding in Iran.


	Panahi was speaking ten days into a brutal crackdown by Iran's hardline government of nationwide popular protests. At least 3,000 protestors are believed to have been killed and another 18,000 arrested, although Panahi reiterated report of 12,000 deaths in his speech.


	“This is not just the pain of one country if the world does not respond to this blatant violence today. Not only Iran but the entire world is at risk. Violence left unanswered becomes normalized and when it become normalized, it's spread become contagious,” he said.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


NBC is truly bringing back pilot season. In addition to the barrage of January pilot orders — six over the past four days — the network also has revived another forgotten pilot season tradition: Friday night greenlights.


	Getting pilot orders tonight are dramas Puzzled, from former Charmed showrunner Joey Falco, and What the Dead Know, from Dick Wolf‘s Wolf Entertainment and writer Beth Rinehart (FBI: Most Wanted). 


	Both projects are crime/cop procedurals based on books, Danielle Trussoni's novel The Puzzle Master and former New York City medical examiner Barbara Butcher's memoir What the Dead Know, respectively. Both are produced by Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group. 

	











	In Puzzled, written by Falco who executive produces with Jordan Cerf, after barely escaping a tragic fire, once-promising college athlete Mike Brink is transformed by a traumatic brain injury that gives him the unique ability to see the world in an unexpected way and helps him solve crimes with local police.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Trussoni serves as producer. 


	Written by Rinehart, What the Dead Know centers on death Investigator Ava Ledger who is really good with dead bodies. It's the living that give her trouble. The series follows Ava as she teams with the NYPD to solve their toughest cases.


	Rinehart executive produces with Wolf Entertainment's Dick Wolf, Tom Thayer, Peter Jankowski and Anastasia Puglisi. Kevin Plunkett, Rebecca McGill and Butcher co-executive produce. 

	











	NBC had been expected to pick up a sizable number of pilots by today's standards this pilot season — about four dramas and four comedies. The network is already overdelivering on its goal with five drama pilots — The Rockford Files reboot, Protection, the untitled Georgaris/Fox project, Puzzled and What the Dead Know. Interestingly, all are in the crime genre and most are procedurals, indicating a clear programming focus for the network this season. (Tonally, Puzzled is believed to be lighter than the others.)


	Even the sole NBC comedy pilot so far this cycle, the untitled Goor/Del Tredici project, is set in the world of crime, revolving around a private detective. With NBC ordering five drama pilots, it is unclear whether the network would stick with four comedy pickups or do fewer.


	Falco previously created and executive produced the 2023 ABC legal drama pilot Judgement starring Sarah Shahi. His series credits also include Sleepy Hollow and Heroes Reborn. In addition to FBI: Most Wanted, Rinehart worked on Wolf Entertainment's Law & Order: SVU and Chicago Justice. Her series credits also include NCIS: New Orleans.

UPDATED with additional details: Kianna Underwood, a former child actor who appeared on Nickelodeon‘s All That and Little Bill, among others, was killed Friday morning in a hit-and-run in Brooklyn, NY. She was 33.


	Underwood was struck by a black Ford Explorer SUV as she attempted to cross the street in a marked crosswalk at Pitkin Avenue and Mother Gaston Boulevard in the Brownsville neighborhood at around 6:45 am, the New York Police Department confirmed to Deadline. She was then “subsequently struck by a black and gray sedan,” police said, and according to witnesses, became lodged under the vehicle and was dragged for two blocks. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

	











	The drivers of both vehicles fled the scene. “There are no arrests, and the investigation remains ongoing by the NYPD Highway District's Collision Investigation Squad,” the NYPD said.


	Underwood was regular performer in Nickelodeon's All That, a live-action sketch comedy show created by Brian Robbins and Michael Tollin, which aired from 1994-2020. She appeared in seven episodes during 2004-05. Underwood also voiced the role of Fuchsia Glover in Little Bill, an animated children's series created by Bill Cosby that aired from 1999-2004 on Nick. She also appeared as Tanessha Labelle in comedy feature The 24 Hour Woman (1999), starring Rosie Perez, Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Patti LuPone, and in the 2001 Rankin/Bass holiday toon Santa, Baby!

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Tia Napolitano is stepping down as showrunner of CBS‘ popular drama series Fire Country after four seasons. She will be leaving at the end of the current season and plans to focus on her own development under the overall deal she has with Fire Country producer CBS Studios. A search for a new showrunner will commence soon.


	Napolitano joined Fire Country, created/executive produced by series star Max Thieriot and writers Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, right after the pilot as executive producer and showrunner and has steered the firefighter drama since. 


Fire Country got off to a hot start, ranking as the No. 1 most-watched new series for the season it launched in, 2022-2023, and was quickly identified by CBS brass as a show with franchise potential.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Now in its fourth season, Fire Country still regularly wins its Friday time period, averaging 8.1 million Live+35 multi-platform viewers to date. It also helped launch spinoff Sheriff Country, which is on track to repeat Fire Country's feat of being the most watched new series in its freshman season.


	“Tia has been instrumental in helping both build and steer Fire Country, which not only became a top series, but is also the foundation of a growing universe,” CBS Entertainment President Amy Reisenbach and CBS Studios President David Stapf said in a joint statement. “We're grateful for all her contributions and tireless work, and look forward to collaborating with her on future projects.”


	Napolitano, whose first TV job was as a writers assistant working for then-Grey's Anatomy showrunners Phelan and Rater, was approached for the Fire Country showrunner job early on, before the pilot was picked up to series. She has been at the helm as the series navigated the writers strike, the L.A. fires and, most recently, the departure of original cast members Billy Burke and Stephanie Arcila at the end of last season.

	











	“I am beyond proud of the past four seasons of Fire Country,” Napolitano said. “All of my gratitude to our cast, crew, writers, producers, fans, and of course CBS and CBS Studios. It's been a beautiful ride!”


	Before joining Fire Country, Napolitano served as executive producer and showrunner on Freeform's Cruel Summer. Her writing-producing credits also include Grey's Anatomy and spinoff Station 19.


Fire Country Season 4 returns with new episodes February 27.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Jennifer Garner exposes Ben Affleck's Beyoncé obsession, the song he plays on repeat","https://pagesix.com/2026/01/16/celebrity-news/jennifer-garner-shares-beyonce-song-ben-affleck-plays-on-repeat/","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 03:32:00 GMT","

Jennifer Garner laid bare ex-husband Ben Affleck's obsession with Beyoncé's music in candid new comments.

“Do you guys do this? Do you listen to a song over and over again?” the “Alias” alum asked the audience during an appearance at Diesel, A Bookstore on Thursday. 

“I just want to tell you something. I've survived this. I have lived through it,” she said.

The “13 Going on 30” actress, 53, then recalled supporting Affleck, also 53, as he filmed “The Town” back in 2009.

“Ben Affleck listens to a song over and over,” she said, according to People.

“I had a three-month-old and a three-year-old living in a rental in Cambridge, Mass., while he was shooting ‘The Town,'” she shared. “And he listened to Beyoncé‘s ‘Halo,' and I would be nursing.”

Affleck directed, co-wrote and starred in the 2010 crime thriller, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival that year and went on to nab a Producers Guild of America nomination for best film — as well as two wins from the National Board of Review.

“The Last Thing He Told Me” author Laura Dave — who appeared at the Los Angeles event alongside Garner and Rita Wilson — sympathized.

“I love that because the only other person now besides Ben that I've heard that does that was [screenwriter] Tom Stoppard,” Dave — who admitted she indulges in the same practice — said. 

“And when I heard that, I thought, okay, I'm in some good company.”

Garner and Affleck married in 2005 and parted ways in 2015, and share kids Violet, 20, Seraphina, 17, and Samuel, 13.

Despite Affleck's marriage to Jennifer Lopez — which lasted from 2022 to 2025 — they've continued a close co-parenting relationship.

Affleck spent Thanksgiving at Garner's Brentwood, Calif., home in November with their kids, and the exes met up the following month for a theater outing at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre with Seraphina — though he was also spotted stepping out with Lopez, 56, and Samuel for shopping and lunch the same day.

“Even though Ben and Jen have been split for a while now, he feels a certain level of comfort with her,” an insider exclusively told Page Six of Garner in November. 

Earlier this month, the mom of three made a rare comment on the most difficult aspect of her divorce from “The Rip” actor, which was finalized in 2018.

“The actual breaking up of a family is what was hard,” she told Marie Claire. “Losing a true partnership and friendship is what was hard.”

However, the actress explained that eventually, it became easier to envision a peaceful co-parenting relationship with her ex. 

“Time is the opportunity to heal,” she said. “Time is the opportunity to forgive, to move on and to find a new way to be friends.”

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are reportedly going through the “first real test” in their relationship as his potential NFL retirement looms amid their wedding planning.

A source claimed the pop star, 36, has been focused more on lifting Kelce's “defeated” spirits following the Kansas City Chiefs' losing season than on making wedding arrangements, reports Daily Mail.  

“Taylor is trying to put him in a better mood by spending more time with him and not bombarding him with wedding plans,” the insider said.

“She would want him to focus on [the wedding] after he makes his career decision because she knows how important that is to him.”

The source added that the “Fortnight” singer is looking at the rough patch as the pair's “first real test of their relationship.”

“They have been together and in love and have enjoyed the success of her tour and career and his Super Bowls and his career. Travis hasn't been in this position before where he is staring at his future with complete 20/20 vision,” they said.

Kelce, 36, has been left feeling “a bit defeated” as retirement rumors hang in the air following the Chiefs' losing 2025-26 season. 

The professional tight end was previously rumored to be considering retirement after the 2024-25 season. However, he ultimately decided to try for one more Super Bowl ring before he officially called it quits.

“He is used to still be playing, and he is missing not being on the field, which might bode well for his fans and the Chiefs if he decides to play another year,” the insider said of Kelce's potential career plans, adding that the NFL star will “make the Chiefs well aware of his future plans by early March.”

Advertisement

“We will know a few weeks after the Super Bowl if he will be returning or not. That is his timeline that he has set to make a decision to play one more year or not,” they added. 

Still, Kelce has a bright future ahead with his soon-to-be wife at his side and career opportunities.

Last month, Page Six exclusively reported that Swift and the “New Heights” podcast co-host have their post-NFL life planned out with different projects.

“Things are changing; he is getting to the end of what he has known all his life and dealing with potential retirement, marriage and a future family with sprinkles of a whole new life in TV,” the insider told Daily Mail, seemingly confirming Page Six's reporting. 

Swift is coping with the challenging moment by “focusing on positivity right now,” per the source. 

“But she wants him to be in a place where he is happy because at the end of the day, that will make them happy,' the source added.

Reps for Swift and Kelce did not immediately respond to Page Six's requests for comment.

As we previously reported, the couple — who announced their engagement in August — originally planned to host an intimate wedding in Rhode Island next summer.

However, those plans appear to have changed. Sources exclusively told Page Six that the pair are now looking at another venue in Tennessee to host an additional ceremony after giving a second look to their potential guest list. 

They're also considering hosting a destination wedding event on a private island.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Steve Coogan is checking into The White Lotus","https://www.avclub.com/steve-coogan-joins-the-white-lotus-season-4","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 01:26:49 GMT","

It's that time on the TV calendar once again, folks: The special, magical moment where every agent in Hollywood suddenly perks their ears up and comes out of their burrows, while A-listers, the children of A-listers, and personal friends of Mike White all frolic nervously in the snow, waiting to hear the news. That's right: It's White Lotus Casting Notice Season!

We kicked off the harvest earlier this week, with news that Chris Messina was reportedly circling an as-yet-unconfirmed part in the show's fourth season. (See also Helena Bonham Carter, similarly rumored but also similarly uncommitted.) No such waffling for British comedy legend Steve Coogan, though: The once-and-future Alan Partridge is checking in to the French version of the fabled luxury resorts.

This is per Deadline, noting that character descriptions for Coogan (who joins a cast that currently, officially, includes Alexander Ludwig and AJ Michalka) are, per series tradition, being kept under wraps. (If we had to guess, the actor will play an affluent older man who is often unpleasant to people around him due to a deep-seated, unexamined dissatisfaction with a life of meaningless privilege, but that's just us being silly with imagination.)

Coogan also isn't the only person to be joining the show's cast today, as newcomer Caleb Jonte Edwards was also announced to be signing aboard the series. As a loosely connected anthology series, The White Lotus tends to ditch cast members between seasons (unless your name is Natasha Rothwell or Jon Gries), which means the casting notices tend to come in pretty hot and heavy once they start rolling. Deadline recently confirmed that the show's fourth season will film at France's Château de La Messardière, which looks suitably lovely and expensive—not, we're guessing, that it'll stop Coogan's character from finding something to be tetchy about, even before the inevitable dying starts.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","James Cameron says he's gotta figure out how to make these Avatar movies for less damn money","https://www.avclub.com/james-cameron-avatar-4-5-budgets-cheaper","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 02:54:45 GMT","

If there was one working director, on the entire planet, who you'd think could worry less about his budgets versus his box office profits, it would presumably be James Cameron. There's nothing new in noting that Cameron is the most fiscally successful film director of all time; even without worrying about inflation, adding up the tallies of all the films the man's written and directed over the years puts his haul somewhere in the $10 billion range, a number that no other filmmaker on Earth has ever even come close to scratching. Cameron has a billion-dollar ($1.23 billion, if you want to get specific about it) movie, Avatar: Fire And Ash, in theaters at this very moment. All of which makes it kind of wild to hear him talking about worries that he's just got to get his costs down if he's ever actually going to make Avatars 4 and 5.

This is per IGN, which was in turn quoting an interview Cameron gave to Taiwan's TVBS News, in which he will not, no matter how hard he's asked, confirm that he's actually making those two long-announced sequels as of yet. It's not precisely clear when Cameron filmed the interview, i.e., whether he knew Fire And Ash was going to wind up with a box office haul that, yes, clocked in at a bit more than half of 2022's Avatar: Way Of Water—but which still made it the third-biggest worldwide box office performer of 2025. “We have to do well to continue,” he tells reporters, noting that the box office is “depressed.” “We have to do well and we need to figure out how to make Avatar movies more inexpensively in order to continue.”

Budgets for Way Of Water and Fire And Ash are a bit tricky to separate out, given that Cameron filmed the two movies simultaneously, but sources usually quote numbers as high as $460 million. (Cameron himself won't confirm exact numbers, simply calling the budgets “a metric fuckton of money,” meaning the resulting films need to make “two metric fucktons of money to make a profit.”) Given that Cameron owns Avatar—with distribution rights and merch owned by Disney—and that these last two movies have taken seven years of his and a whole lot of other people's lives to make and get into theaters, it makes a certain sense that he might still be feeling a little commitment-phobic.

Indeed, “If I make them” has been a common refrain from Cameron throughout the press tour for Fire And Ash. Even as he's confirmed that Michelle Yeoh will appear in those new films—hypothetically—he's also made statements promising that, in the absence of the last two movies, he'll hold a press conference to just tell people how they would have ended. In a different director, it'd read as a lack of confidence, but this is, well, James Cameron—a man who will happily hijack an anniversary special just so he can semi-definitively tell people complaining about that door at the end of Titanic to fuck off. If he says the way he makes Avatar movies has to change for them to make Avatar 4 and 5 make fiscal sense, he's the man in the position to know.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Great Job, Internet! We're all catching Cory In The House for the Nintendo DS fever","https://www.avclub.com/gji-cory-in-the-house-nintendo-ds-meme","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 00:24:46 GMT","

The line between internet memes and things that actually matter has gotten increasingly fuzzy over the last few years, with the GameStop “stonks” story standing as an obvious example of the way something that started as a silly joke, bubbling up from the depths of an internet message board, can have a binding communal impact that ends up actually altering people's lives. The current online furor over Disney's Cory In The House for the Nintendo DS has not reached the level where Craig Gillespie is likely to make a movie about it, and, if there is a loving god, it never will. But it is causing some pretty serious money to change hands, as IGN reports that copies of what would otherwise be a completely inessential and forgotten Disney Channel tie-in handheld game are now trading for hundreds of dollars, all in service of a raging meme.

If literally no words in that preceding paragraph made sense, we both sympathize, and will now try to break it down for you: See, Cory In The House was a short-lived spin-off of the Disney Channel's That's So Raven, in which Kyle Massey played the son of the White House executive chef, getting up to various money-making shenanigans while occasionally getting life advice from the POTUS. (The show was apparently killed off by a combination of the 2007 Writer's Strike and Massey's family getting litigious after he was injured performing a stunt on the show; such are the means by which Cory becomes no longer in The House.) In 2008, Disney Interactive Studios tapped developer Handheld Games—the minds behind That's So Raven: Psychic On The Scene, natch—to make a Cory In The House game for Nintendo's twin-screened handheld, a stealth adventure in which the playable Cory sneaks around the White House, foiling a plot involving mind controlling bobbleheads. It was, by all accounts, not a very good video game, with critics criticizing its clunky controls and general Cory In The House-ness. But, the internet being what it is, the idea of a licensed game for a barely remembered TV series struck a chord in a certain kind of online person, and memes about Cory In The House for the Nintendo DS began picking up periodic bursts of the internet's eternally scattered attention.

Cut to this month, when a new fascination with the game bubbled up on 4chan—and then managed to metastasize to Metacritic, where user reviews (glowingly declaring that the game “changed my life”) were soon taking off. (Cory In The House for the Nintendo DS is currently the sixth-ranked game of all time on the site's user rankings, nestled in alongside games like The Witcher 3 and Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater.) And while those simply wanting to catch CITHFTNDS Fever could just pirate the game, or watch a longplay on YouTube (Hard+100%+Bonus), the urge to actually touch a physical copy of the game (or make money off of those who do) is apparently very powerful. Which is to say, it's now hit a point where Ebay listings for the game have started cropping up with prices that start around $150, and then grow from there. And while no one has yet bit on, say, alexg2205's “Cory in the House Nintendo DS Promotional Poster drawn by the Anime Creators rea”—which appears, to our untrained eyes, to be very similar to a hand-drawn picture of the game's box art done in pencil—for $600, Ebay does have records of the game actually being sold this week for as much as $400. Which, we have to assume, is more money spent on a joke than Disney spent for any of the individual gags in the actual series, because when the internet hyper-fixates on something, it inevitably winds up doing so in ways where very silly amounts of money start getting moved around.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","PHOTOS: Michelle Pfeiffer & Kurt Russell in ‘The Madison'","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/photos-michelle-pfeiffer-kurt-russell-madison/","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 16:19:45 GMT","

 A new Paramount+ show starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Kurt Russell called “The Madison” will officially premiere on March 14, 2026, according to Deadline. Here are photos from the upcoming “Yellowstone” spin-off show.

“The Madison,” created by Taylor Sheridan, is a neo-Western drama following a New York City family after they relocate to the Madison River valley in Montana. According to Entertainment Tonight, the family makes the move out west after a tragedy, although we don't yet know the details. 

The series is the fifth “Yellowstone” spin-off, following the original series, “1883,” “1983,” and “The Marshalls.” Season one of the new Sheridan show will only have six episodes, but it has already been renewed for season two.

Pfeiffer plays the matriarch of the main family, the Clyburns. Her character, Stacy, has two daughters, played by Elle Chapman and Beau Garrett. Based on the photos from Paramount+, the characters in “The Madison” seem to spend a lot of time in nature. The outdoorsy shots are in stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of New York City, which could provide for some interesting fish-out-of-water moments.

A still from episode four shows Pfeiffer surrounded by nature, likely deep in thought. As for what she's contemplating, fans will have to wait until the show airs in March.

Pfeiffer may be best known for her film roles, including “Scarface,” “New Year's Eve,” and Amazon Prime's recent Christmas movie, “Oh. What. Fun.,” but “The Madison” won't be her first foray into television. In fact, Pfeiffer has already been nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series for her work in “The Wizard of Lies.”

Russell plays Preston Clyburn, Stacy's husband. Beyond that, we don't know much about his character. On IMDb, he's listed as a cast member, but we don't know how many episodes he will be in, a contrast to Pfeiffer, who's listed as performing in all six episodes.

In the Paramount+ photos, Russell appears to be at home in the wilderness. One still shows him fishing with a huge smile on his face, while another shows him sitting on a rock in a beautiful river, seemingly calm. Unfortunately, Paramount+ has yet to release any photos of Russell and Pfeiffer together on set.

“The Madison” won't be the first time Russell and Pfeiffer are working together. In 1988, they both starred in “Tequila Sunrise,” a romantic crime movie in which Russell accidentally falls in love with Pfeiffer while investigating someone close to her.

Former Nickelodeon star Angelique Bates publicly urged people to help fellow actor Kianna Underwood more than a year before Underwood passed away in a hit-and-run in Brooklyn, a renewed point of reflection following Underwood's death at age 33.

Underwood, best known for her work on “All That” and as the voice of Fuchsia Glover on “Little Bill,” passed away on Jan. 16 after a vehicle struck her while she crossed a street in the Brownsville neighborhood, according to People. Authorities said the driver fled the scene, and the investigation remains ongoing.

In a resurfaced Instagram video from November 2023, Bates addressed Underwood's situation directly, urging the entertainment community and the public to offer help and compassion. Bates said Underwood was struggling and needed support, emphasizing that former child actors deserve care long after their time in the spotlight.

Bates, who starred on “All That” during its early Nickelodeon years, said she felt compelled to speak out after learning about Underwood's circumstances. In the video, Bates asked viewers to reach out, help connect Underwood with resources, and recognize her humanity beyond her childhood fame.

“She needs help,” Bates said in the video. Bates added that she wanted Underwood to receive support rather than judgment.

At the time, Bates did not accuse specific individuals or organizations of wrongdoing. Instead, she framed her message as a call for empathy and collective responsibility, particularly for performers whose early success does not guarantee long-term stability.

Underwood began acting as a child and built a résumé that extended beyond television. In addition to her Nickelodeon work, she appeared in films such as “The 24-Hour Woman” and “Santa, Baby!” and performed in stage productions like “Hairspray.”

Friends and fans have since shared tributes online, remembering Underwood as a talented performer with a warm presence and a passion for the arts. Many noted her versatility and commitment to acting across different media.

Police said officers responded to a 911 call shortly before 7 a.m. and found Underwood unconscious in the roadway. Emergency responders pronounced her dead at the scene. According to authorities, surveillance footage and witness accounts suggest the vehicle dragged her for a short distance before the driver fled.

As news of Underwood's death spread, Bates' earlier plea gained renewed attention. For some, it highlighted the importance of listening when artists speak up for one another. For others, it underscored the need for stronger support systems for former child performers as they navigate adulthood.

Underwood's legacy now includes both her on-screen work and the conversations her story has sparked. As tributes continue, many hope her life will be remembered not only for its tragic ending but for the joy and creativity she brought to audiences, and for the reminder that compassion can make a lasting difference.

Label:

January 17, 2026

In a 2019 interview with Machine Music—one of the few he's ever given—Patrick Walker pushed back on the notion that Warning makes “very loud folk music.” His retort, palpably prickly even in text: “I don't see that connection there. Warning was very much about riffs, and Watching from a Distance was a metal album.” It's understandable that Walker's interlocutor would pursue this line of questioning. Warning's singular approach to doom metal has a way of making you disbelieve your own ears. On their now-classic sophomore LP, Watching from a Distance, the UK band paired slow, heavy guitar riffs with Walker's nakedly emotional lyrics and pleading, edge-of-tears vocals, a combination that has long sent listeners scrambling for comparisons to sad-bastard folk, goth rock, and, most perniciously, emo. On a new 20th anniversary reissue, the album sounds as idiosyncratic (and as metal) as ever, and Warning's confrontational vulnerability feels ahead of its time.

Metalheads have never been afraid of high drama, but they tend to prefer it dressed in the genre's signature heightened imagery. Iron Maiden will put a lump in your throat, but they'll do it by convincingly conjuring the last thoughts of a doomed soldier, not by moaning about a breakup. Candlemass broke new ground for histrionics in metal, but their best songs were about demons, sorcerers, and witches. Even My Dying Bride, Warning's closest spiritual antecedent, have always couched their little-r romantic songs in a lot of big-R Romanticism—the blood, the wine, the roses, and other such gothic Byronisms. Warning have little use for metaphor. Their songs are sad, not with remote, idealized melancholy but with the familiar sadness of the here and now. With an emotional openness that successors like Pallbearer and Spirit Adrift would take and run with, Walker exculpates what's in his heart and sings it directly into the heart of the listener.

Walker has always been circumspect on what the five long songs on Watching from a Distance are specifically about, but they all seem to deal with the same relationship, observed at different phases but always at a nadir. On the title track, he can observe the object of his attachment only across a great expanse of miscommunication, and on “Faces,” he's estranged even from himself. “Footprints” cuts its pathos with misdirected anger, while “Echoes” dreams of a reconciliation that the narrator seems to know is impossible. The hardest hitting lines sound like unfiltered thoughts scrawled on napkins, never like poetry tortured into meter: “I am starving in your mystery”; “I don't know what my heart is anymore”; “I wish you were here with me tonight.” It's a little embarrassing, but love often is, especially once it's over. Walker understands that he's laying it on thick. On “Bridges,” he asks, “Can someone feel too much?” It's a worthy thesis for the record, and a question it strives to answer in the negative.

Walker's voice is the perfect vessel for Watching from a Distance's excess of feeling. He's as direct and plainspoken as a singer as he is as a writer; an attentive first-time listener could easily transcribe every word on the record. Walker likes to end a line with an unexpected upward inflection, leaving the melodies as unresolved as his narrators' emotions. At their core, those melodies are resolutely straightforward, the better not to get in the way of the sentiments, and they're effectively mirrored by Walker's almost sing-songy guitar riffs. The riffs still manage to come across as crushingly heavy, not because of extreme distortion or envelope-pushing dissonance but because they manage to articulate Walker's words with such fluidity. His guitar loudly weeps.

Drummer Stuart Springthorpe is the secret co-MVP of Watching, keeping its molasses-slow time and inserting infrequent but always impactful tom-heavy fills into the album's surfeit of negative space. A full-album live set, recorded at the Roadburn festival in 2017 and included with the deluxe edition of the reissue, illuminates Springthorpe's importance by way of his absence. Andrew Prestidge is a capable replacement, but Springthorpe's more deliberate, minimal approach makes the studio recordings the essential versions of these songs. Still, the live album is a nice addition, especially for the chance to hear a second guitarist, Wayne Taylor, meet up with Walker in glorious, unhurried harmony.

While the band has promised new material in 2026, Watching from a Distance still remains the most recent Warning album, and Walker has spent the past 20 years making spacious, largely acoustic alt-rock with his other project, 40 Watt Sun. Set next to that music, the handwringing over Watching's doom-metal status seems especially ridiculous. With a slight recalibration of metal's archaic working definition for heaviness, it's one of the heaviest records the genre has ever produced.

	Apollonia says Prince never meant to cause her any sorrow, so his estate shouldn't either.


	In a new declaration filed in her federal court lawsuit on Friday, the model and actress known as Apollonia claims Prince was “adamant” during a face-to-face meeting two months before his death that she should keep using and performing under the name he gave her to play his love interest in the iconic 1984 movie, Purple Rain.


	Apollonia, 66, says that Susan Moonsie, another member of the girl group Apollonia 6 that Prince formed after the film's release, was with her for the Feb. 28, 2016, meeting that took place immediately after Prince's Piano and a Microphone concert in Oakland, California.


	“During our conversations that evening, Prince was adamant that we continue with our ventures such as musical performances, merchandising, and audiovisual projects, and that he wanted us both to use our Apollonia and Apollonia 6 trademarks in order to be able to earn a living, stay creative, and be financially secure in our later years,” Apollonia, born Patricia Kotero, wrote.

	











	Kotero, who's now suing the estate, says Prince never trademarked the name while he was alive, so the estate's Paisley Park Enterprises was out of line when it assumed control of the Apollonia trademark last June and sought to cancel her other registrations and applications in a proceeding with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Kotero is now asking the court to reject the estate's request that her lawsuit be dismissed.

	











	“The truth is none of this litigation would have occurred if Prince were still alive,” she wrote in her declaration filed Friday. “He would be appalled by the unbecoming conduct of PPE and the efforts by PPE to usurp his wishes. I do not trust PPE, and I am afraid that if PPE is able to accomplish its goal of taking the Apollonia Marks from me, my identity will be lost, my rights will be diminished, my business will be interrupted, and I will be unable to use the Apollonia marks without repercussion from PPE.”

	Kotero first filed her lawsuit in August, saying she “famously starred” in Purple Rain, and Prince “consented to and encouraged” her use of her character's name before his accidental fentanyl overdose in April 2016 at age 57. She claimed it was “highly likely” that the estate would sue her for trademark infringement if it prevailed in its efforts with the trademark office, so she asked the court for a judicial declaration confirming she's entitled to her name and marks.


	In a statement posted on the official Prince Instagram account last August, the estate said the estate had the right to “protect and preserve Prince's assets and legacy.” The statement said the estate has repeatedly attempted to resolve the dispute privately and also claimed it offered Kotero multiple opportunities to perform at Paisley Park.


	In a motion to dismiss the lawsuit filed Oct. 13, the estate doubled down on the claim it has no intention of blocking Kotero from using the name. “Defendant has never threatened to sue plaintiff, never asked her to cease using her adopted stage name, nor ever asked her to cease any of her business activities,” the motion, obtained by Rolling Stone, said. The estate argued that the question of ownership should be resolved by the trademark office, not the court.


	In an amended complaint, Kotero said she believed the estate was attempting to secure control of Apollonia for ventures such as the Purple Rain musical staged at the State Theater in Minneapolis, ahead of a possible Broadway run. She cited a promotional image from the production that showed actress Rachel Webb with the name “APOLLONIA” printed prominently. Kotero said the image violated her right of publicity. “Defendants do not have the authority to allow a third party to use plaintiff's name, image, voice, likeness or other indicia of identity, including plaintiff's likeness from the original film,” her filing said.

	The estate countered that the use of the name beneath a photograph of another actress in advertising materials was insufficient to support a legal claim. “Plaintiff has only alleged that defendant has used the name of a character from Purple Rain, a film in which plaintiff previously appeared,” the estate argued in its dismissal motion.

	











	“We are very confident that Apollonia will prevail in protecting her name,” Kotero's lawyer, Daniel M. Cislo, tells Rolling Stone. Lawyers for the estate did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. A hearing on the estate's motion to dismiss is scheduled for Feb. 13.

	After rising to fame in Purple Rain, Kotero toured internationally to promote the film and her hit song “Sex Shooter.” She and Prince became “lifelong friends,” her lawsuit said, and she co-wrote the Bangles' 1986 hit “Manic Monday” with him. She also provided vocals on Prince's song “Take Me With You,” using her stage name. In 1985, she became a regular on the television series Falcon Crest, again using the name Apollonia. Her self-titled solo album was released in 1988.


	Prince had no will and no children when he died, leading to a messy battle over his assets. His six siblings ultimately inherited equal interests in his estate.

	Lawyers for Timothy Busfield said in an opposition filing Friday that an independent investigation into the accusation against the actor undermines New Mexico's child sex abuse case, and that Busfield should be released from jail. 


	On Wednesday, Busfield faced a judge for the first time since turning himself in on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse; the actor did not enter a plea at the hearing, and the judge ordered that Busfield be held without bond until his next hearing, scheduled for Tuesday, January 20.


	Busfield's lawyers argued for Busfield's release in court filings Friday, stating that the actor previously passed a polygraph test  and that Warner Bros.' independent investigation into the accusations by twin child actors on the series The Cleaning Lady found the allegations unfounded, ABC News reports.


	The filing also cited that the child actors' parents both had a history of fraud, and that the father had admitted to “conspiracy to commit wire fraud” and was disbarred.

	“The State offers no reliable proof—only allegations advanced by witnesses with documented histories of fraud and financial exploitation, contradicted by a comprehensive studio investigation, and refuted by witnesses and objective risk assessments,” Busfield's lawyers wrote.


	“For all of these reasons—the independent investigation that undermined the State's allegations at every turn, the affirmative findings of the polygraph and ABEL assessment, the overwhelming evidence of character and community support, and the absence of any reliable proof of dangerousness—the State cannot meet its burden of clear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release will reasonably protect the community.”

	











	The filing was also accompanied by letters of support for Busfield written by his wife Melissa Gilbert as well as his Thirtysomething cast mates Peter Horton and Ken Olin. “I know in the very bottom of my heart that Timothy would never do anything to cruelly exploit or harm anyone, let alone a child,” Olin wrote.

	Busfield said in a video statement prior to turning himself in, “I'm going to confront these lies. They're horrible, they're all lies, and I did not do anything to those little boys. I'm going to fight it with a great team, and I'm going to be exonerated. I know I am, because this is all so wrong and all lies.”


	Prosecutors alleged in a pre-detention filing that after news of Busfield's arrest went public, another victim's father, Colin Swift, reported to law enforcement that his 16-year-old daughter was abused by Busfield “several years ago” at an audition in Sacramento, California.

	“[Busfield] begged the family to not report to law enforcement if he received therapy,” the pretrial detention motion alleges. “Colin Swift, a therapist himself, thought at the time that was the best thing to do.” Prosecutors also cited two other incidents where Busfield was accused of sexual assault, once in 1994 and a second incident in 2012, though neither incident resulted in criminal charges.


	Following the charges against Busfield, the actor was dropped from his longtime agency Innovative Artists.

	After years of delays and false starts, A$AP Rocky's fourth studio album, Don't Be Dumb, finally arrived. It's the first major hip-hop domino of 2026, positioning him for a year likely filled with high-profile appearances, collaborations, and headline-making moments.


	Once critiqued for sporadic releases despite being viewed as one of New York City and hip-hop's prized talents, Rocky now presents a project that finds him seasoned and at ease, both personally and musically.


	The album — featuring contributions from BossMan Dlow, Brent Faiyaz, Danny Elfman, Doechii, Gorillaz, Jon Batiste, Jessica Pratt, Slay Squad, Thundercat, Tyler, the Creator, Westside Gunn, and Will.i.am — balances cocky boasts and one-liners with introspection on love, fatherhood, and personal growth.


	If you ask us, Don't Be Dumb is a long-awaited, bold statement from Rocky that cements his status as a central figure in hip-hop.


	In celebration of his return, VIBE highlights and ranks the best songs from the album that will stand the test of time.

	











	“Robbery” finds A$AP Rocky and Doechii pulling off a slick, sensuous heist atop production by Loukeman. Rocky leans into his fashion-forward bravado, firing off witty couplets that blur the lines between luxury, desire, and dominance with ease.


	Doechii proves to be the perfect accomplice, delivering a standout performance that's arguably the album's most dynamic guest spot. Her sharp presence and playful confidence heighten the song's tension, pushing it beyond a traditional collaboration.

	











	Mixing sexual innuendo with clever wordplay, the pairing feels natural and electric, making “Robbery” an easy recommendation and a track that's well worth revisiting.


	“Whiskey (Release Me)” emerges as one of the more intoxicating selections on the album. It operates as a conceptual cut, centered on his complicated love affair with his chosen spirit.


	Produced by T-Minus, Digital Nas, Zach Fogarty, and Rocky himself, the song sways with a hazy, late-night atmosphere that mirrors its subject matter. Rocky weaves boasts about influence and legacy with reflective bars that read like a breakup letter to a vice he can't quite quit.

	Westside Gunn's ad-libs add texture, while Damon Albarn's additional vocals lend a ghostly edge. Definitely the perfect soundtrack to pour a round of Mercer + Prince to.


	“Stay Here 4 Life” stands out as a catchy and immersive addition to A$AP Rocky's Don't Be Dumb.


	Produced by Hit-Boy, Brent Faiyaz, and Loukeman, the song glides over a hypnotic instrumental that gives Rocky space to explore the obsessive bond he shares with Rihanna, offering listeners a glimpse into moments of intimacy without oversharing.


	His line about a “fairytale with a happy ending” captures the romantic tone cleanly. Brent Faiyaz adds another layer of allure, with his feathery tenor floating across the hook and bridge as he croons, “I wish that I could stay here.”


	Together, the collaboration delivers a smooth, memorable record that's already caught traction among listeners and become an instant favorite from A$AP's latest long player.


	“Helicopters” landed as the final gauntlet thrown before Don't Be Dumb‘s arrival, and it finds A$AP Rocky firing on all cylinders.

	Produced by Rocky alongside Kelvin Krash, Soufien 3000, and Dre Moon, the single captures Pretty Flacko at his sharpest, talking greasy over a rollicking, high-adrenaline soundscape.


	Rocky sounds fully locked in, especially when he raps, “When tennis shoes had the check or three stripes on the side/ Way before Puma cut the check, yeah, three strikes, that's your life/ Niggas runnin' out of sweat.”


	Pretty Flacko goes Peter Parker on “Helicopters,” a raucous offering that balances bravado with precision while paying homage to feuding Harlem predecessors Jim Jones and Cam'ron. If you were yearning for vintage A$AP Mob vibes from Rocky, this song delivers.

	











	“Punk Rocky” finds A$AP Rocky confidently merging punk rock rawness with uptown swagger, resulting in a genre-blending salvo that feels natural rather than performative.


	Produced by Cristoforo Donadi, Ging, Zach Fogarty, and Rocky himself, the track thrashes forward while leaving room for introspection. The usually cocksure lyricist exposes moments of vulnerability, admitting isolation and mistrust before pivoting into defiant self-questioning about love and regret.


	Confiding in his Styrofoam cup, Rocky turns emotional turbulence into a clever anthem for lovelorn nights. On first listen, the song lands as a standout experiment—bold, emotionally grounded, and proof that his stylistic detours still feel rooted in authenticity.


	“Playa” arrives as a syrupy groove and one of the week's stronger releases from A$AP Rocky's Don't Be Dumb.


	Produced by Cardo Got Wings, Johnny Juliano, Yung Exclusive, and Loukeman, the track feels like a sonic continuation of “Stay Here 4 Life,” but with a sharper thematic turn. The tempo is dialed up as tumbling 808s and glossy synths push Rocky back into braggadocious form.


	His drawls about untouchable player codes and high-fashion nostalgia, scoffing at informants and haters along the way. Lines framing responsibility as true “player” behavior add bite, reading like a subtle jab aimed at a former ally.


	“Stole Ya Flow” is a vicious diss track that positions A$AP Rocky at his most confrontational, aiming squarely at Drake with a barrage of calculated jabs that probe Drake's alleged insecurities and public missteps.


	Arguably the premier offering on Don't Be Dumb, the song frames Rocky in a brazen yet noticeably unbothered state of mind, reflecting confidence rooted in both career longevity and personal stability.

	Produced by Danny Elfman, ICYTWAT, and Kelvin Krash, the record's menacing tone heightens its impact as Rocky escalates tensions beyond his earlier remarks on “Highjack.”


	Lines like, “First you stole my flow, so I stole yo' bi**h,” cut sharply, while mockery of Drake's delivery and image — down to mimicking his “I'm Upset” cadence — only adds insult to injury.This story was originally published on VIBE.

	Public support for the call to “Abolish ICE” is growing in the wake of the disturbing killing of Minnesota mom Renee Good, and the constant stream of stories and footage of similarly shocking abuses by ICE agents in Minneapolis and other cities. 


	New polling released this week by The Economist and YouGov confirmed support for ICE is rapidly eroding: For the first time ever, support for abolishing ICE has eclipsed opposition to the idea, by a margin of 46 percent to 43 percent — and the idea of keeping ICE in its current form is 10 points less popular than abolishing it altogether. 


	A private memo from Democratic firm Blue Rose Research, first reported by The New Republic, found 76 percent had seen the footage of ICE agent Jonathan Ross shooting Good three times, and 86 percent had heard about the incident. Voters polled in that survey overwhelmingly backed measures that would require ICE officers to obtain a warrant before arrest (+29 points) and would ban them from wearing masks (+16 points). 

	











	Outrage over ICE's flagrant abuses of power has been so widespread that Democratic lawmakers are racing to offer voters ideas of what look like to rein in the agency — even as there seems to be a stark a divide between public opinion and the comparatively mild measures Democrats in Congress appear willing to take to limit ICE's power. Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) was ridiculed online after pledging to introduce a bill that would put QR codes displaying the officer's name, badge number, and agency on their uniforms. Democrats Ro Khanna and Jasmine Crockett have introduced the “ICE Oversight and Reform Resolution,” which would mandate agents wear body cameras and de-escalation training and ban the wearing of masks.

	Such proposals, advocates say, would do little to curb abuses of the kind seen in horrifying footage of Minneapolis and other American cities. Actually stopping ICE, they believe, would require stripping the agency of funding and ending its ability to arrest and detain individuals.

	ICE was founded in 2003 as part of the reorganization of the Department of Homeland Security. But, as Silky Shah, executive director of Detention Watch, a coalition of groups who advocate for an end immigration detention, points out, that “creation” was really the consolidation into one agency of actions that were already being carried out by several others.  

“For so many years, the relationship between ICE and local police was the reason why deportations skyrocketed” 


	In 1996, Bill Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which increased penalties on immigrants who violated the law — both documented and undocumented — and made it easier to deport them. After its formation in the early 2000s, ICE generally operated by partnering with local police who helped carry out arrests, detentions, and deportations. 


	“For so many years — especially under the Bush and Obama years — the relationship between ICE and local police was the reason why deportations skyrocketed,” Shah says. “[ICE] having those tiny jail contracts, having agreements with the sheriff's departments, working with city police — that's the way people were funneled into the system.”


	There was backlash to that arrangement and many communities ended those relationships, refusing to allow their local police department to partner with ICE on immigration enforcement arrests or detentions. The so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act — Trump's signature budget bill, which passed in July of last year — dramatically increased the ICE budget, reducing its reliance on those local partners and allocating funds for the creation of a massive immigration detention apparatus that will be owned and operated by the federal government itself — one that, advocates warn, will be difficult to dismantle once it is in place. 


	“From my perspective, one of the most significant things that happened last year was the passage of the budget bill in July,” Shah says. For the last decade, ICE has operated with a budget of between $4 and $5 billion a year, but under Trump's bill that figure is set to grow to more than $8 billion this year, more than $12 billion next year, and almost $16 billion dollars in 2028, according to calculations from the Center for American Progress's Barry Kogan.

	A draft solicitation obtained by The Washington Post last year showed the federal government was working to establish “a deliberate feeder system” that will distribute immigrants to one of seven large-scale warehouses across the country. The plan would allow ICE to hold up to 80,000 immigrant detainees at a time, according to the Post.

	











	“As anybody who's worked against mass incarceration or U.S. militarism can tell you: Once you start building this stuff, it's actually really hard to take it down,” Shah says. “Our job right now is blocking as much as we possibly can. Yes, they got this funding, but we can still block these new detention centers. We can still do the work to prevent them from carrying out all of Stephen Miller‘s fantasies.”


	Communities where these new ICE facilities are being proposed — including Social Circle, Georgia, and Merrimack, New Hampshire — are already mobilizing to stop them from going forward. Doing so, Shah says, is one of the key ways civilians themselves can work to prevent the further growth of ICE.

“We can still do the work to prevent them from carrying out all of Stephen Miller's fantasies”


	Another way to limit ICE's power is to strip the agency of the funding it would use to execute on this dramatic expansion. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has been at the forefront of that push. “We're seeing what they're doing with this reckless explosion in funding, and I want everybody to understand that the cuts to your health care are what's paying for this,” she said, speaking to reporters earlier this week. 


	On Wednesday, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) proposed a bill that would reverse the ICE funding, allocating that money instead into tax credits designed to offset the increase in health care premium. “The One Big Beautiful Bill nearly triples ICE's budget at a time when American families across the country are facing higher premiums due to the ACA premiums tax credit lapsing,” Moulton told WGBH.


	On Thursday, Michigan Rep. Shri Thanedar introduced a bill that went even further. His “Abolish ICE Act” not only proposes a total rescission of ICE funding but the abolition of the entire agency within 90 days of the proposed bill's passage. “We must reform ICE, but it looks at this stage, folks, that ICE is beyond reform,” Thanedar said at a press conference previewing the legislation on Wednesday. “ICE is totally out of control.”


	It's not clear yet how many of his colleagues will be willing to join him on that bill. Their reluctance may stem from the counsel of centrist think tanks like Third Way and Searchlight Institute who have cautioned Democrats to avoid renewing calls to abolish the agency, saying such efforts would be “politically lethal,” and urging them to rallying around the call “Reform and Retrain” ICE instead.


	For now, the most encouraging signal from the Democratic Party as a whole is its growing opposition to legislation that will fund the Department of Homeland Security this year. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries has said members of his caucus will not support a spending bill that either increases funding for ICE or lacks new accountability measures on the agency. “Right now, there's no bipartisan path forward for the Department of Homeland Security,” Jeffries told reporters Wednesday. The fate of that bill, which is required to pass the House by January 30 under an agreement that ended last year's government shutdown, will be the biggest indication yet of how committed Democrats are to changing ICE's current trajectory.

A giant alien statue in New Mexico is shown in this picture. Alien Con promises speakers, vendors, and alien-themed fun at the Prestige Event Center this April.

HEBER — The Imperial Valley is set to experience the first-ever Alien Con UFO & Extraterrestrial Conference on April 18 at the Prestige Event Center in Heber. The event is bringing together authors, experiencers, military veterans, and speakers from across the country to discuss extraterrestrial encounters and unidentified flying objects.

The event is organized by Pedro Leon, a lifelong Imperial Valley resident and author of “My UFO Diaries,” who said the idea originated from conversations he had while attending Comic-Con events.

“I asked everyone, 'What do you think about the Alien Con?'” Leon said.

Leon said his interest in UFOs stems from what he describes as multiple first encounters, beginning in the early 2000s.

“I had a close encounter, probably encounters, and I mean, people are coming out of the closet now,” he said. “People are telling me the stories now.”

According to Leon, the panelists for the Alien Con will share firsthand experiences. One speaker, he said, is a former pilot who witnessed unexplained objects while flying.

“All this stuff they show on TV,” Leon told the Imperial Valley Press. “She has seen it while she was a pilot.”

Aside from the speakers, the conference will feature vendor booths, children's activities, face painting, a tattoo artist, and themed attractions, such as customized golf carts converted to resemble UFOs.

Leon said he has witnessed multiple UFOs and believes there is a portal near Tecate, Mexico.

Leon partnered with the Prestige Event Center owner, Jason Heisel, whom he has known for years through community events.

“I said. ‘Hey, what do you think about the Alien Con?'” Leon said, stating that Heisel proposed to host the event at Prestige Event Center.

He hopes the event appeals not only to believers but also to skeptics. He believes public attitudes towards UFOs have shifted. He also addressed the criticism he has received online.

“They call me a demon or say that I'm crazy and stuff like that. I hate to say this, but I have to say it in my defense. People believe in a God they've never seen,” Leon countered.

“Aliens are in the Bible; they're known as Fallen Angels,” Leon continued. “They didn't know what else to call them.“

Leon said there is no way for humans to be the only life force in a huge galaxy with millions of stars and planets.

“Impossible for us to be the only ones. You're not seeing them. I've seen a little green man,” he said.

Leon shared an account of an experience he had in 2004, which he said involved paralysis and seeing a small figure in his bedroom.

“My body went into this, like a tingling sensation. It was crazy. And then my body froze. I couldn't move my body, but I could move my eyes, so I've been through this before,” he said.

“He was at the edge of my feet. He's about three or four feet tall. He's just standing there,” Leon recalled. “We just looked at each other. For how long? I don't know. And then all I know is that I wake up in the morning.”

Leon believes extraterrestrial encounters may follow his family lines and referenced indigenous rock art and ancestral stories as possible evidence of long-standing contact. “I've seen the drawings on the wall, in the mountains,” he said, noting that he belongs to the Apache Tribe.

Leon hopes the event will become a yearly gathering in the Valley.

“I hope from here to eternity. I'm not around. Maybe somebody else will pick up the torch,” he said.

Leon told the Imperial Valley Press he is also trying to organize a monthly UFO club in Imperial Valley.

Alien Con tickets are available online or at the door, and a family package is offered. Vendor spaces are available as well.

“Someday you will see something that will change your mind,” Leon said.

A high-profile UAP whistleblower known as Gerb has detonated a political bombshell by accusing a powerful 'secret club' of running America's UFO cover-up from behind closed doors, linking the Pentagon's anomaly office to one of the most influential science laboratories in the world.

According to Gerb, a mysterious metallic object recovered in Ohio and handed to Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2024 was not treated as neutral scientific evidence, but instead became part of a tightly controlled system designed to sanitise uncomfortable truths about unidentified aerial phenomena.

His claims suggest that senior defence figures, corporate contractors and federal scientists have been rotating between the same elite institutions, raising explosive questions about whether the American public is being deliberately kept in the dark about possible non-human technology.

In 2024, AARO, the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, contracted Oak Ridge National Laboratory to examine a peculiar metallic specimen recovered from private land in Ohio.

The material was reported to have unusual properties that did not align neatly with known earthly alloys, sparking intense interest among UAP researchers. Instead of transparent findings, AARO later issued a brief statement suggesting the sample was likely ordinary. Gerb blasted this conclusion as rushed and politically motivated, arguing that Oak Ridge had been chosen precisely because of its close ties to defence contractors rather than its independence.

Gerb's most damaging claim centres on former AARO chief Sean Kirkpatrick, who left his government role in December 2023 to become Chief Technology Officer for Defence and Intelligence Programs at Oak Ridge. Gerb argues this creates an obvious conflict of interest, since Kirkpatrick had previously overseen which materials AARO sent for analysis, including the Ohio specimen.

The controversy deepened when Oak Ridge quietly removed a webpage celebrating Kirkpatrick's appointment, while he failed to list the senior position on his public CV. To Gerb, this is not coincidence, but evidence of image management and hidden alliances.

Gerb also pointed to former Undersecretary of Defence for Intelligence and Security Ronald Moultrie, who deleted his past position on Battelle's board from his official biography. This is crucial because Oak Ridge is operated by UT-Battelle, a subsidiary of Battelle itself. In Gerb's view, this means the same corporate ecosystem effectively oversees both the investigation of UAP evidence and the Pentagon office meant to scrutinise it. He describes this as a 'closed loop of power' where the same players control funding, research, and public narratives.

UAP advocates have rallied behind Gerb, accusing AARO of acting more like a disinformation machine than a truth-seeking body. Supporters online have hailed him as a legend for exposing what they see as a coordinated effort to downplay anomalies and label everything mundane. One commenter claimed AARO will never address this for reasons that should be obvious, while others argued taxpayers are being misled while paying for secrecy.

Defenders of AARO insist that movement between government, academia and defence labs is normal in national security work, and that Oak Ridge remains one of the most capable scientific facilities in the world. Yet the deleted webpages, altered CVs and tight control over findings have only fuelled suspicion.

For now, the Ohio specimen remains shrouded in classification, and the full Oak Ridge analysis has never been released to the public. What Gerb has achieved, however, is far more significant than a single metal sample. He has shifted the UFO debate away from blurry skies and towards the corridors of power, where influence, secrecy and corporate ties collide.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","Scientists Narrow Search to 100 Mysterious Signals, and One of Them Could be from Aliens!","https://dailygalaxy.com/2026/01/scientists-100-signals-one-from-aliens/","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 15:15:00 GMT","

The SETI@home project's final 100 signals could mark the most promising, or the most haunting, silence in the search for alien intelligence.

The SETI@home project, after decades of data collection, is approaching the end of its massive search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have narrowed their focus to the final 100 unexplained radio signals, marking one of the most exhaustive analyses in the history of the project. This culmination was formally presented in two papers published in 2025 in The Astronomical Journal, one focusing on data acquisition and processing, and the other on data analysis and findings. 

The SETI@home initiative, founded in 1999, turned millions of home computers into a distributed scientific instrument, each one helping to sift through the torrent of radio data gathered by the Arecibo Observatory. For years, signals piled up faster than researchers could interpret them. 

“Until about 2016, we didn't really know what we were going to do with these detections that we'd accumulated,” said David Anderson, computer scientist at UC Berkeley and co-founder of the project. “We hadn't figured out how to do the whole second part of the analysis.”

The 2025 papers finally bridge that gap. They detail how researchers systematically examined the billions of candidate detections for patterns that might indicate intelligent origin. “These signals appeared as ‘momentary blips of energy at a particular frequency coming from a particular point in the sky,'” Anderson explained. The team developed new algorithms to flag signals that could not be attributed to satellites, radar, or other Earth-based interference.

Despite this immense progress, the challenge of processing such an enormous dataset remains formidable. As Berkeley astronomer Eric Korpela noted, “There's no way that you can do a full investigation of every possible signal that you detect, because doing that still requires a person and eyeballs.”

The first paper, published in the Astronomical Journal, focusing on data acquisition and processing, details the sophisticated filtering systems and distributed computing techniques that made SETI@home unique. The second, published in the same journal, centered on data analysis and findings, lays out how those refined methods led to the isolation of roughly 100 promising signals. Both papers stress transparency and reproducibility, offering open datasets and refined code to allow other researchers to continue the search independently.

As Anderson emphasized, 

“If we don't find ET, what we can say is that we have established a new sensitivity level. If there were a signal above a certain power, we would have found it.”

 The authors report that the project now represents the most sensitive narrowband search across large portions of the sky ever completed.

Despite their achievements, the team admits to mixed emotions. “We are, without doubt, the most sensitive narrowband search of large portions of the sky, so we had the best chance of finding something,” Korpela reflected. “So yeah, there's a little disappointment that we didn't see anything.”

But that disappointment is tempered by scientific realism. Anderson acknowledged that early choices in data handling, driven by the limits of computing power in the late 1990s, may have led to potential oversights.

 “We have to do a better job of measuring what we're excluding,” he said. “Are we throwing out the baby with the bath water? I don't think we know for most SETI searches… In a world where I had the money, I would reanalyze it the right way. And we did make some mistakes. These were conscious choices because of how fast computers were in 1999.”

Even now, there remains an air of mystery around the dataset. The team's latest filtering may not have caught everything. As Anderson hinted,

 “There's still the potential that ET is in that data and we missed it just by a hair.” 

That lingering uncertainty fuels both scientific rigor and imagination, a reminder that, even after decades, the search for extraterrestrial life continues to balance between data and hope.

Korpela and Anderson's work not only defines the cutting edge of radio astronomy but also sets a foundation for the next generation of SETI projects, from machine-learning-assisted signal recognition to expanded telescope networks. The legacy of SETI@home will endure as a bridge between human curiosity and cosmic possibility.

Sunny Dawn Johnson

The Scottsdale Society of Women Writers will welcome internationally known psychic medium, spiritual teacher and bestselling author Sunny Dawn Johnston this month.

She will speak at the society's 6 p.m. Jan. 28 meeting at Chompie's restaurant, l 9301 E. Shea Blvd., at the corner of 92nd Street and Shea Boulevard in Scottsdale.

Johnston, a prolific author and regular contributor to Woman's World magazine, has written 22 books focused on intuition, mediumship and spiritual development.

Two of her best-known titles, Invoking the “Archangels” and “The Love Never Ends,” have become bestsellers and form the foundation of her public talks and workshops.

The January presentation is open to all women writers and will focus on intuition, creativity and spiritual connection – subjects organizers say align with the group's mission of supporting writers across genres while fostering personal and professional growth.

Founded to provide women writers with opportunities to connect, exchange ideas and build supportive professional relationships, the Scottsdale Society of Women Writers offers monthly meetings, guest speakers and networking opportunities.

Its mission includes honoring all forms of professional writing, encouraging mentorship and volunteerism, and helping members challenge themselves creatively while remaining actively engaged in their craft.

Johnston brings decades of experience to the event. She has worked as a psychic medium and visionary since her teenage years and has built an international following through courses, one-on-one sessions and live events.

 Her work, both in person and online, focuses on helping individuals align with intuition and explore what she describes as higher-dimensional awareness.

In addition to her teaching and publishing work, Johnston volunteers as a psychic detective with FIND ME, a global nonprofit organization that collaborates with investigators, canine search-and-rescue teams and law enforcement to help locate missing persons and support affected families.

Attendees are asked to check in between 5:15 and 5:30 p.m.

Meeting admission for 2026 has been set at $30, which includes dinner, tax and gratuity. The price covers a buffet-style meal, dessert and beverages, with menus rotating monthly.

Payment will not be accepted at the door; advance payment is required by the Sunday preceding the meeting.

Annual dues for the Scottsdale Society of Women Writers will remain $50 for 2026. Membership benefits include access to events, a member directory, ongoing support within the local writing community and presentations by professional speakers throughout the year.

Guests are welcome to attend up to two meetings before being asked to join as full-time members. Those planning to bring a guest are asked to notify the organization in advance.

A new comprehensive analysis suggests that while conspiracy beliefs are deeply entrenched, they are not entirely resistant to change. The findings indicate that specific intervention strategies, particularly those involving direct fact-checking and alternative explanations, can achieve modest reductions in these beliefs. This meta-analysis was published in the European Journal of Social Psychology.

Conspiracy theories often serve as alleged explanations for complex events, ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to geopolitical conflicts. Believing in these narratives can lead to tangible negative consequences, such as vaccine hesitancy or disregard for democratic norms.

Lukasz Stasielowicz, a researcher at the Department of Psychology at the University of Salzburg, undertook this study to move beyond individual experiments and provide a systematic overview of what actually works. While many scientists have tested various persuasion techniques, there has been a lack of clarity regarding which methods consistently yield results and which factors moderate their success. Stasielowicz aimed to quantify the average impact of these interventions and identify the specific characteristics that enhance their effectiveness.

“Conspiracy theories play a role in everyday situations, such as deciding whether to get vaccinated after reading alarming statements in a messaging app, arguing with relatives about political news during a meal, and reading social media posts questioning medical advice from health professionals,” Stasielowicz told PsyPost. “However, there is surprisingly little solid evidence on what actually helps people believe less in harmful conspiracy theories.”

“Many research teams have tested various interventions, but these strategies have not yet been compared to determine what works, for whom, and under what circumstances. This study aimed to systematically compare the available interventions and identify features that make interventions most effective.”

To accomplish this, the researcher conducted a systematic literature search using databases such as Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria required studies to measure conspiracy beliefs following an intervention and to employ a control group for comparison. Stasielowicz identified 56 independent samples that met these standards. These samples represented a total of 27,996 participants. The studies were primarily conducted in Western nations, with a significant number originating from the United States and Europe.

The analysis utilized a Bayesian three-level meta-analytic model. This statistical approach allowed the researcher to account for the fact that single studies often report multiple outcomes, such as measuring beliefs about several different conspiracy theories simultaneously. The dataset included 273 distinct effect sizes. Stasielowicz examined a wide range of variables to explain differences in outcomes, including the design of the intervention, the demographics of the participants, and the specific nature of the conspiracy beliefs being challenged.

Stasielowicz found that the average intervention effect was small but positive. This suggests that it is possible to reduce conspiracy beliefs, though the typical impact is akin to dimming a light rather than flipping a switch. The overall effect size was estimated at 0.16, which indicates a modest shift in belief rather than a transformative change. However, the data revealed substantial variability between different studies, implying that the quality and type of intervention matter significantly.

“One of the most striking findings was how different the results were across studies,” Stasielowicz said. “Some interventions worked quite well, whereas others barely changed beliefs or even seemed to strengthen conspiracy thinking. Thus, designing and deploying interventions needs to be done carefully to avoid backfiring and pushing people deeper into conspiratorial rabbit holes full of implausible narratives. A bad intervention can be worse than no intervention at all.”

Interventions that included fact-checking of specific conspiracy claims tended to be more effective than other approaches. The analysis suggests that scrutinizing details such as dates, timelines, and numbers directly associated with a conspiracy theory yields better results than general attempts to promote skepticism.

Similarly, the data indicates that providing alternative explanations for the events in question can enhance the persuasive power of the message. This suggests that simply debunking a claim is often insufficient unless a factual narrative replaces the conspiratorial one.

The degree to which the intervention content matched the outcome measure also played a role. Stasielowicz found that effects were larger when the arguments presented in the intervention directly addressed the specific beliefs measured in the questionnaire. For example, countering myths about vaccines proved effective for reducing vaccine-related conspiracy beliefs but would likely have little impact on beliefs regarding government surveillance. This finding supports the idea that belief change is often domain-specific rather than a general shift in mindset.

“The main takeaway is that it is possible to reduce conspiracy beliefs, but the average impact of current interventions is modest rather than transformative,” Stasielowicz explained. “Approaches that directly fact-check specific conspiracy claims and carefully examine dates, timelines, quotations, numbers, and internal contradictions tend to be more effective than approaches such as ridicule or the teaching of general scepticism rules.”

“However, we must be careful. Since not every conspiracy theory is necessarily wrong, public institutions, influencers, and researchers need to avoid automatically dismissing discussions as conspiracy theorizing and instead focus on clearly documenting what is and is not supported by evidence.”

The characteristics of the sample population appeared to influence susceptibility to these interventions. The results showed that interventions tended to be more effective among students compared to the general population. Younger participants also appeared more willing to revise their beliefs than older individuals.

Additionally, the analysis provided some evidence that samples with a lower proportion of college graduates showed larger reductions in conspiracy beliefs. This might suggest that individuals with higher levels of formal education hold their non-standard beliefs more rigidly, or perhaps that the specific interventions used were better suited for general audiences.

The measurement tools used by researchers also affected the observed outcomes. Studies that employed longer questionnaires with multiple items to assess conspiracy beliefs tended to detect larger effects than those relying on single-item measures. This implies that nuanced changes in attitude might be missed by overly simplistic survey instruments. The analysis also indicated that interventions were slightly more effective when the baseline level of conspiracy belief was moderate to high, rather than low.

“As we know from everyday experiences, belief change is hard, and conspiracy beliefs are no exception,” Stasielowicz told PsyPost. “Interventions work like dimming a light rather than completely switching it on and off; they facilitate belief change rather than completely transforming people's minds. They are unlikely to fully convince firm believers to completely reject conspiracy theories, but even slightly lowering beliefs in implausible conspiracy theories may matter at the population level for outcomes like vaccine uptake or peaceful transfer of power after elections. Still, these modest effects highlight how much room there is to improve interventions.”

Stasielowicz identified several limitations within the existing body of research. A significant portion of the included studies were classified as having a high risk of bias. This is largely because it is difficult to blind participants to the purpose of an intervention when they are being presented with arguments against specific conspiracy theories. If participants guess the goal of the study, they may alter their responses.

The meta-analysis also highlighted that many studies were underpowered, meaning they did not include enough participants to reliably detect small effects. This lack of statistical power can lead to an overestimation of effects in published literature.

Additionally, the vast majority of studies only measured immediate changes in belief. There is a scarcity of data regarding whether these reductions in conspiracy thinking persist over days, weeks, or months. The researcher notes that without longitudinal data, it is difficult to determine if these interventions provide lasting benefits or merely temporary shifts in opinion.

“A common misunderstanding is to treat the ‘average effect' as if it describes every study, when in reality, some interventions helped more effectively than others,” Stasielowicz noted. “Many existing studies focus on short-term impact, are often underpowered, and are at high risk of bias. More high-quality, long-term studies are needed, especially on specific design features that so far have been examined only in a handful of experiments, such as the use of LLM chatbots to reduce conspiracy beliefs.”

“A key long-term goal is to identify which specific intervention components actually drive belief change so that future interventions can be shorter, less costly, and more tailored. By combining this meta-analysis with my review of the characteristics of people who believe in conspiracy theories, it should be possible to test whether certain groups benefit more from particular intervention strategies and whether personalization adds value.”

“The article is open access, so anyone – including practitioners, journalists, and interested readers – can read the comprehensive results for free,” the researcher added. “The study offers concrete guidance on how to design the most promising interventions, for example, by tailoring messages to specific conspiracy claims.”

The study, “The Effectiveness of Interventions Addressing Conspiracy Beliefs: A Meta-Analysis,” was authored by Lukasz Stasielowicz.

Trump's calls for a takeover of Greenland puts open scientific collaboration that is helping our understanding of the threat of global sea-level rise at risk.

A 30-minute stroll across New York's Central Park separates Trump Tower from the American Museum of Natural History. If the US president ever found himself inside the museum he could see the Cape York meteorite: a 58-tonne mass of iron taken from northwest Greenland and sold in 1897 by the explorer Robert Peary, with the help of local Inuit guides.

For centuries before Danish colonisation, the people of Greenland had used fragments of the meteorite to make tools and hunting equipment. Peary removed that resource from local control, ultimately selling the meteorite for an amount equivalent to just US$1.5 million today. It was a transaction as one-sided as anything the president may now be contemplating.

But Donald Trump is now eyeing a prize much larger than a meteorite. His advocacy of the US taking control of Greenland, possibly by force, signals a shift from dealmaking to dominance. The scientific cost would be severe. A unilateral US takeover threatens to disrupt the open scientific collaboration that is helping us understand the threat of global sea-level rise.

Greenland is sovereign in everything other than defence and foreign policy, but by being part of the Kingdom of Denmark, it is included within Nato. As with any nation, access to its land and coastal waters is tightly controlled through permits that specify where work may take place and what activities are allowed.

 




Over many decades, Greenland has granted international scientists access to help unlock the environmental secrets preserved within its ice, rocks and seabed. US researchers have been among the main beneficiaries, drilling deep into the ice to explain the historic link between carbon dioxide and temperatures, or flying repeated Nasa missions to map the land beneath the ice sheet.

The whole world owes a huge debt of thanks to both Greenland and the US, very often in collaboration with other nations, for this scientific progress conducted openly and fairly. It is essential that such work continues.

Research shows that around 80% of Greenland is covered by a colossal ice sheet which, if fully melted, would raise sea level globally by about 7 metres (the height of a two storey house). That ice is melting at an accelerating rate as the world warms, releasing vast amounts of freshwater into the North Atlantic, potentially disrupting the ocean circulation that moderates the climate across the northern hemisphere.

The remaining 20% of Greenland is still roughly the size of Germany. Geological surveys have revealed a wealth of minerals, but economics dictates that these will most likely be used to power the green transition rather than prolong the fossil fuel era.

While coal deposits exist, they are currently too expensive to extract and sell, and no major oil fields have been discovered. Instead, the commercial focus is on ""critical minerals"": high-value materials used in renewable technologies from wind turbines to electric car batteries. Greenland therefore holds both scientific knowledge and materials that can help guide us away from climate disaster.

Trump has shown little interest in climate action, however. Having already started to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement for a second time, he announced in January 2026 the country would also leave the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, the global scientific body that assesses the impacts of continued fossil-fuel burning. His rhetoric to date has been about acquiring Greenland for ""security"" purposes, with some indications of accessing its mineral wealth, but without mention of vital climate research.

 




Under the 1951 Greenland defence agreement with Denmark, the US already has a remote military base at Pituffik in northern Greenland, now focused on space activities. While both countries remain in Nato, the agreement already allows the US to expand its military presence if required. Seeking to guarantee US security in Greenland outside Nato would undermine the existing pact, while a unilateral takeover would risk scientists in the rest of the world losing access to one of the most important climate research sites.

Greenland's sovereign status and its governance is different to some other notable polar research locations. For example, Antarctica has, for more than 60 years, been governed through an international treaty ensuring the continent remains a place of peace and science, and protecting it from mining and other environmental damage.

Svalbard, on the other hand, has Norwegian sovereignty courtesy of the 1920 Svalbard treaty but operates a largely visafree system that allows citizens of nearly 50 countries to live and work on the archipelago, as long as they abide by Norwegian law. Interestingly, Norway claims that scientific activities are not covered by the treaty, to almost universal disagreement among other parties. Russia has a permanent station at Barentsburg, Svalbard's second-largest settlement, from which small levels of coal are mined.

Unlike Antarctica or Svalbard, Greenland has no treaty that explicitly protects access for international scientists. Its openness to research therefore depends not on international law, but on Greenland's continued political stability and openness – all of which may be threatened by US control.

If it is minded to take a radical approach, Greenland could develop its own treaty-style approach with selected partner states through Nato, enabling security cooperation, mineral assessment and scientific research to be carried out collaboratively under Greenlandic regulations.

—Greenland is twisting, tensing and shrinking due to the 'ghosts' of melted ice sheets

—Huge ice dome in Greenland vanished 7,000 years ago — melting at temperatures we're racing toward today

—Catastrophic tipping point in Greenland reached as crystal blue lakes turn brown, belch out carbon dioxide

The future for Greenland should lie with Greenlanders and with Denmark. The future of climate science, and the transition to a safe prosperous future worldwide, relies on continued access to the island on terms set by the people that live there. The Cape York meteorite – taken from a site just 60 miles away from the US Pituffik Space Base – is a reminder of how easily that control can be lost.

So far, Claudia Sheinbaum has urged her country to play it cool. Trump's actions in Latin America are making industries nervous

In the aftermath of U.S. President Donald Trump's raid of Venezuela and capture of its then president, the possible implications for their country were not lost on Mexico's political and business class.

“I'm not saying that Mexico is Venezuela,” Juan Carlos Baker, a former undersecretary for foreign trade and director-general for North America for the Mexican government, said over breakfast in Mexico City. “I don't think that the U.S. is going to replicate those measures. But clearly, they will feel more confident in pushing crazy ideas.”

Many of those would-be scenarios were itemized in interviews with Mexican economic leaders, industry representatives and government veterans this week. 

Most prominent are worries about Mr. Trump sending the U.S. military into Mexico to take on its drug cartels, which he has been openly threatening. Nearly as top of mind are concerns about economic demands he could make, while feeling emboldened as the North American free trade pact (known in Canada as the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, or CUSMA) is up for review this year. Then there are newly plausible guesses of how he could lash out, such as cutting off exports of Texas-produced natural gas on which Mexico heavily relies.

It all seemingly points toward an anxiety level, around the neighbouring superpower's volatile behaviour, that is by now unpleasantly familiar to Canadians even if specific concerns are different. 

But even post-Venezuela, there remains a sanguineness to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's response that starkly contrasts with the more urgent, sometimes panicked reaction by Canadian politicians since Mr. Trump returned to the White House. 

It's a strategy of de-escalation with Mr. Trump behind which most Mexicans have fallen in line, and even commentators critical of other government policies give her credit for cool-headedness. But it is at some risk of fraying if she's seen to surrender sovereignty in return for peace, or if she fails to stop the U.S. President from exacting a further toll on an already troubled Mexican economy. 

And it could make for an uneasy – or complementary – combination of styles and tactics between the Mexican and Canadian governments, which have recently showed renewed determination to work together to manage the shared threat.

Ms. Sheinbaum and Prime Minister Mark Carney – who joined Mr. Trump for last month's FIFA World Cup draw – each have their own approaches for dealing with the mercurial U.S. President.Jonathan Ernst/Reuters

Ms. Sheinbaum's strategy of playing down Mr. Trump's provocations was on display this week, when she said at her daily news conference (one of the ways she maintains calm control over government messaging) that the risk of American military strikes against the drug cartels had been mitigated by a “good conversation” with the U.S. President. It was the latest instance of her “very serene and cold-blooded approach,” as Gerardo Esquivel – a former deputy governor of the Bank of Mexico who advised Ms. Sheinbaum's 2024 election campaign – put it.

While having frequent calls with Mr. Trump and avoiding the theatrics of public meetings, she has continually talked up her ability to work with him. And she has rarely gone as far as Prime Minister Mark Carney – let alone former PM Justin Trudeau – in publicly suggesting that the United States is no longer a reliable partner. Nor is there nearly as much messaging, from Ms. Sheinbaum or anyone else, about the need for Mexico to carve out its own economic path to reduce its U.S. dependence.

There have been some efforts to foster greater self-reliance, highlighted by the revival of an old Made in Mexico branding campaign to promote Mexican consumption of domestic products, and some relatively quiet attempts at market diversification, including modernization of a trade agreement with Europe. 

But the resources behind these efforts have been relatively limited. 

Some of this, at least on the rhetorical side, tends to be chalked up to personality. Ms. Sheinbaum's populist predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, might have taken a fierier anti-U.S. stance. Despite leading the Morena party that Mr. López Obrador founded, and sharing its left-of-centre ideals, Ms. Sheinbaum is much more technocratic.

But other, deeper-running dynamics are also at play.

One of them is realism about Mexico's alternatives. It has long been even more economically dependent than Canada on the U.S., which accounts for over 80 per cent of its exports. It has fewer natural resources that are in global demand, despite some export growth potential around sectors such as agriculture and mining. Much of its trade revolves around low-cost manufacturing – that is, low-cost for the U.S. market, not relative to many other countries, including seemingly natural trade partners around Latin America. 

That helps explain, for instance, why analysts here see little prospect of Ms. Sheinbaum following Mr. Carney's lead by warming relations with China, after Mexico recently imposed new tariffs on China at Mr. Trump's behest. Not only do they point toward greater perceived danger for Mexico in antagonizing the U.S., they also see China as more of a manufacturing competitor than a reciprocal trade partner.

The National Guard – whose forces keep watch at the Los Pinos complex in Mexico City – are a more militarized force than in decades past, highly involved in patrolling the border and combating cartels.

At the same time, nearly all conversations also turn to another form of realism around the U.S. relationship.

A complicated history, involving military conflicts as recently as the early 20th century and frequent recent tensions around issues such as immigration and the drug trade, means volatility has come as less of a shock than in Canada. There has been less personal offence taken at Mr. Trump's hostility, less feeling of betrayal by a close friend, less sense that the world has been upended.

But that history is a double-edged sword for Ms. Sheinbaum, due to heightened sovereignty sensitivities.

Those exist most obviously around potential action to combat the drug cartels. 

Their brutal impact on the country, including effective control of entire states, is undeniable, and Ms. Sheinbaum has adopted a more aggressive approach to combatting them than did Mr. López Obrador. She has also walked a fine line trying to satisfy Mr. Trump's desire to engage in the crackdown, including transferring alleged cartel members to face justice in the U.S. 

But even among people who believe action to date has been insufficient, a common view is that the U.S. military directly striking the cartels within Mexico would cross a red line, unless Ms. Sheinbaum were credibly able to present it as a joint effort she'd requested (and perhaps even then).

Economist Valeria Moy thinks curbing trade with China to appease Mr. Trump goes too far.

The sovereignty concerns are also frequently invoked around potential economic concessions.

Valeria Moy, a free-market economist who heads the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, described herself in an interview as no fan of Chinese trade policies. But she expressed discomfort with trying to appease Mr. Trump by restricting Chinese imports or investment. And she feels similarly about possibly giving in to his recent demands to cut Mexico's (fairly modest) oil exports to Cuba, or curbing relations with other countries in his crosshairs.

“For me that's sovereignty – being able to talk to whoever you want to talk to,” Ms. Moy said. 

There are various theories around what other possible sovereignty compromises Mr. Trump could demand as part of the looming trade-deal review, from U.S. access to Mexico's energy market to new rules of origin that could compromise Mexico's manufacturing. But there are also cautions about making further concessions before the CUSMA review even begins in earnest.

“My advice is don't keep feeding the dragon every day,” said Ildefonso Guajardo, who as economy minister under then president Enrique Peña Nieto was at the forefront of trade negotiations during Mr. Trump's first term, “because the dragon will not be satisfied.”

Tariffs have brought a year of uncertainty to border crossings such as Zaragoza-Ysleta in Ciudad Juárez, where trucks queue to bring goods to and from the United States.

As for what Ms. Sheinbaum might be able to get in return, even just by way of relief from punitive measures already taken by Mr. Trump, expectations are limited.

Although Mexican officials are fond of pointing out that Mexico (like Canada) is currently subjected to fewer U.S. tariffs than most other countries, it's also (like Canada) suffering from unusually high 25-per-cent tariffs on specific sectors such as steel and automotive.

Meeting at his office, Rogelio Arzate – who leads the association representing Mexico's significant truck-manufacturing industry – pointed to charts showing his members' production down about 35 per cent in 2025.

Any continuing tariffs, he suggested, will impact that output. But “realistically, the tariffs are probably here to stay,” and his best hope is for them to be significantly lowered. The word out of the Mexican government is that it will settle for those sectors paying lower tariffs than overseas competitors.

Meanwhile, the uncertainty around CUSMA's future is making it difficult to attract domestic investment – including as part of Ms. Sheinbaum's signature economic strategy, Plan Mexico, which is aimed partly at attracting advanced and traditional manufacturing. 

That contributed to Mexico's dismal 0.5-per-cent economic growth in 2025, although most economists also point to domestic missteps. (Top among those are extremely controversial changes to the judiciary initiated by Mr. López Obrador, which have undermined investor confidence in the rule of law.)

Still, the prospect of CUSMA collapsing or being dramatically altered is treated by most voices here as a remote one, mostly because of pressure from the U.S. private sector to keep it in place.

Adding a little to that confidence are improvements in Canada-Mexico relations.

At the start of Mr. Trump's return to office, there was a feeling that then prime minister Trudeau was neglecting the relationship. And Mexicans were rankled by suggestions, made particularly undiplomatically by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, that Canada should approach the U.S. separately and let Mexico fend for itself.

Now, Mexico is set to receive its largest Canadian trade delegation in memory next month, led by senior cabinet minister Dominic LeBlanc.

While that will be aimed at strengthening sectoral ties, ranging from financial services to auto parts to agriculture, Mexican observers drew encouragement from a visit this past fall by Mr. Carney, where he and Ms. Sheinbaum seemed to be on the same page about dealing with Mr. Trump.

That united front has been maintained through subsequent meetings between the two leaders. The hope, on both sides, is that it will continue to withstand challenges from the U.S. President, and from divergent domestic strategies for contending with him.

Donald Trump shows little patience for those who say he's violating international law. But how is the rules-based order supposed to work?

A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.



            Worried about losing unified Republican power in Washington and mystified at his lack of support among the public, President Donald Trump keeps talking about not holding the November midterm elections, when Republicans could lose control of the House, Senate or both.
    


            Trump doesn't understand why his approval rating is underwater (and it is, on every issue, in a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS and released Friday).
    


            “I wish you could explain to me what the hell's going on with the mind of the public,” he told House Republicans in a speech earlier this month.
    


            Later, he added: “Now, I won't say, ‘Cancel the election. They should cancel the election,' because the fake news will say, ‘He wants the elections canceled. He's a dictator.'”
    


            But Trump did talk about canceling the election in an interview with Reuters this week. He said Republicans have been so successful that “when you think of it, we shouldn't even have an election.”
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said the president was “joking” and “being facetious” about canceling the election.
    


            If it's a joke, it's material he's been working on for months. Told during an appearance with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last September that Ukraine won't hold an election during a period of martial law during its war with Russia, Trump expressed some envy.
    


            “So you say during the war, you can't have elections,” Trump said. “So let me just say, three and a half years from now – so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections? Oh, that's good.”
    


            People laughed.
    


            Trump routinely says things that seem like trolls until they don't. Owning Greenland? Not a joke. However, he seems to have retreated from the oft-repeated idea of an unconstitutional third term.
    


            And for the record, unlike Ukraine, the US has held elections in the midst of multiple wars, when the British had invaded in 1812 and when it was at war with itself in 1864. It held elections during world wars when millions of Americans fought overseas in the 20th century as well.
    


            Trump knows that presidents rarely pick up seats in a midterm. His administration has been moving at breakneck speed to change the government because, as his chief of staff famously said, they know that presidents expect to lose power after their first two years. A net loss of just a handful of seats would give control of the House to Democrats, for instance, requiring their buy-in for spending and giving them power to investigate his administration.
    


            The Constitution requires that a new Congress be sworn in on January 3, 2027. Election Day is set in law, so it is theoretically feasible for Congress to move it, but not to cancel the election. Elections are supposed to be administered by each state, so state governors and legislatures could, in theory, move their own elections to deal with a major disaster, but there's no precedent for it. To get into the weeds of all of this, read a report from the Congressional Research Service.
    


            Trump has also mused about using emergency powers to meddle with elections. He told the New York Times recently that he regrets not directing National Guards to seize voting machines after the 2020 election.
    


            Even the elections he has won, he has said were rigged. There's still no evidence of any widespread voter fraud, even after all these years of the Trump era.
    


            Election officials say they are thinking very carefully about all of this. Asked about Trump's musings at an event sponsored by The Atlantic this week, Arizona's top election official, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, said this:
    


                    “Look, you can't cancel the election… We've got a whole bunch of scenarios that we're playing through to make sure that we're prepared for the types of processes that might be necessary to preserve our democracy so that if somebody tries to cancel something, if somebody tries to take some stuff they're not entitled to, we can go to the courts, get the orders, and hopefully have the backup of law enforcement to make sure that we can move forward through this.”
                





            “The fact that we're running through these scenarios in the first place should tell you something about the health of our democracy,” Fontes added.
    


            To that end, he would not elaborate on what scenarios they're preparing for.
    


            “I don't want to give the bad guys any ideas,” Fontes said.
    


            While Trump might fantasize about canceling the election, the reality is that the election system is already changing in some key ways. Some of them may be enormously consequential.
    


            Republicans have drawn themselves nine more friendly seats across the country, and Democrats have ended up with six, mostly in California. Republicans see additional opportunity in Florida, while Democrats plan a redistricting ballot initiative in Virginia in April. Read more.
    


            If the Supreme Court decides to further gut the Voting Rights Act, Republicans could in theory redraw maps in many other states. Read takeaways from October's oral arguments.



            The long-term result of more and more political gerrymandering without protections for racial minority-focused districts could be the smothering of minority-party delegations in multiple states, making the House map look increasingly more like the presidential map. Far fewer Democratic districts in Texas. Far fewer Republican districts in California — even though there are millions of both Republicans and Democrats in both states.
    


            While much of the effort has been stopped, for now, by courts, Trump's goal is to exert more executive control over elections that are supposed to be governed by Congress and states.
    


            A federal court on Thursday sided with California against the administration's demand that the state turn over information on its 23 million voters.
    


            The Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether mail-in ballots that are postmarked by, but arrive after Election Day can still be counted. The decision could have serious consequences for the country's large scale adoption of mail-in voting in recent years. Trump is a loud skeptic of the practice even though he has personally voted by mail. His executive order would also scramble how states use voting machines, another response to phantom voter fraud that could actually drastically slow down the counting of ballots.
    


            Early on, his administration scaled back the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, which is meant to helps states guard their election systems from attack. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem canceled funding for an information sharing network that helped states detect and ward off coordinated hacking attacks, as CNN reported last year.
    


            His Justice Department has rewired the agency's Civil Rights Division away from its original core mission of civil rights abuses, including those related to elections. One current focus of the division is to help states “clean” voter rolls, although a judge recently ruled that effort was a misapplication of the Civil Rights Act.
    


            Trump's administration has already tried to change how people vote through executive action, and who they vote for through changing maps.
    


            There's a lot of time for more gaming the system between now and November, and Trump clearly already has the midterms on the brain.

President said 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland will begin on 1 February and increase to 25% on 1 June

Donald Trump threatened a 25% tariff on a slew of European countries including Denmark, Germany, France and the UK – until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland, in an extraordinary escalation of the president's bid to claim the autonomous Danish territory.

In a lengthy post on Saturday on Truth Social, Trump said he would impose a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland beginning 1 February, “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America”.

He said the tariff will increase to 25% on 1 June.

“This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump said.

The president's interest in Greenland intensified following the US raid that captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro earlier in January. While he has claimed the Arctic territory's current status poses a national security threat to the US, this has been disputed by US allies, including Denmark.

In the Saturday morning post, Trump said Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland “have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown”. It was an apparent reference to Nato allies deploying troops in Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump's threats to forcefully take the Arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.

Trump suggested, incorrectly, that residents of Greenland “currently have two dogsleds as protection” – and claimed “China and Russia want Greenland” to the detriment of the US. “Nobody will touch this sacred piece of land, especially since the national security of the United States, and the world at large, is at stake,” Trump wrote.

His latest tariff threat comes just eight months after Trump announced that he had struck a trade pact with the UK – and six months after he announced a pact with the European Union.

The UK would have protection against future US tariffs “because I like them”, Trump declared in the summer. He described the pact with the EU as a “powerful deal” and an “important” partnership.

His threat to impose tariffs within days on a string of European allies is set to challenge relations. In the UK, senior political figures including Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, and Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, swiftly rebuked the move.

“These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable,” Trump claimed in his post. “Therefore, it is imperative that, in order to protect Global Peace and Security, strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly, and without question.”

The president has repeatedly turned to tariffs in a bid to force countries to bend to his will – with some success. Days after returning to office for his second term in early 2025, Colombia agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants after Trump threatened steep duties on the country's exports to the US.

Trump, who has previously extolled the benefits of tariffs as a negotiating tool, stressed on Saturday that the US was “immediately open to negotiation” with Denmark and any of the countries it was threatening to hit with these new tariffs.

His aggressive global trade strategy has raised fears for the US economy, which analysts and policymakers have warned could face significant damage from sweeping tariffs on the world.

While the White House has played down such concerns, a vast wave of tariffs unveiled by Trump last spring – when he proclaimed the start of a new era for the US economy – was quickly reversed as global markets fell sharply.

But his administration's erratic rollout of other tariffs nevertheless significantly strained US trade ties with the world. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, the highest level since 1935.

The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said recently that Greenland's defence is a “common concern” for the whole of Nato. The Guardian reported that European troops had deployed to Greenland, in part, to establish what a more sustained ground deployment on the territory could look like, and partly to reassure the US that European Nato members were serious about Arctic security.

Fewer than one in five of Americans approve of Trump's efforts to acquire Greenland, a poll published on Thursday by Reuters/Ipsos found. Both Democrats and Republicans oppose the effort, and only 4% of Americans think the US should take Greenland using military force.

Much of Trump's wider trade strategy is currently in the hands of the US supreme court, which is mulling whether the imposition of many of his tariffs was legal. A decision could be announced as early as next week.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday branded U.S. President Donald Trump a “criminal” for supporting protesters in Iran, and blamed demonstrators for causing thousands of deaths. 

In a speech broadcast by state television, Khamenei said the protests had left “several thousand” people dead — the first indication from an Iranian leader of the extent of the casualties from the wave of protests that began Dec. 28 and led to a bloody crackdown.

“In this revolt, the U.S. president made remarks in person, encouraged seditious people to go ahead and said: ‘We do support you, we do support you militarily,'” said Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters. He reiterated an accusation that the U.S. seeks domination over Iran's economic and political resources.

“We do consider the U.S. president a criminal, because of casualties and damages, because of accusations against the Iranian nation,” he said. He described the protesters as “foot soldiers” of the United States and said they had destroyed mosques and educational centers. “Through hurting people, they killed several thousand of them,” he said.




His comments come a day after Trump sounded a conciliatory tone, saying that “Iran canceled the hanging of over 800 people,” and adding that “I greatly respect the fact that they canceled.” He did not clarify whom he spoke to in Iran to confirm the state of any planned executions. His comments were a sign he may be backing away from a military strike. 

The official IRNA news agency reported that Tehran Prosecutor Gen. Ali Salehi, referring to Trump's remarks about the cancellation of the death sentence of 800 protesters, said: “Trump always makes futile and irrelevant statements. Our attitude is severe, preventive and fast.” He did not elaborate.

In recent days, Trump had told protesting Iranians that “ help is on the way ” and that his administration would “act accordingly” if the killing of demonstrators continued or if Iranian authorities executed detained protesters.

In his speech, Khamenei said rioters were armed with live ammunition that was imported from abroad, without naming any countries. 

“We do not plan, we do not take the country toward war. But we do not release domestic offenders, worse than domestic offenders, there are international offenders. We do not let them alone either,” he said, and urged officials to pursue the cases.

Iran has returned to an uneasy calm after harsh repression of protests that began Dec. 28 over Iran's ailing economy. The crackdown has left at least 3,095 people dead, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, exceeding that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalling the chaos surrounding the 1979 revolution.

The agency has been accurate throughout the years of demonstrations, relying on a network of activists inside Iran that confirms all reported fatalities. The AP has been unable to independently confirm the toll. 

Iranian officials have repeatedly accused the United States and Israel of fomenting unrest in the country. On Friday, Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, accused the U.S. and Israel of meddling in the unrest.

There have been no signs of protests for days in Tehran, where shopping and street life have returned to outward normality, and Iranian state media has not reported on any new unrest.

During the protests, authorities blocked all internet access on Jan. 8. On Saturday, text messaging and very limited internet services began functioning again briefly in parts of Iran, witnesses said.

Cellphone text messaging began operating overnight, while users were able to access local websites through a domestic internet service. Some also reported limited access to international internet services via use of a virtual private network, or VPN.

The extent of access and what was behind it wasn't immediately clear. It was possible that officials were turning on some systems for the start of the Iranian working week, as the outage has affected businesses, particularly banks in the country trying to handle transactions.

Internet traffic monitoring service Cloudflare and internet access advocacy group NetBlocks reported very slight increases in connectivity Saturday morning, while Iran's semiofficial Mehr news agency also reported limited internet access. It did not offer an explanation.

A call by Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi for protesters to take to the streets again from Saturday to Monday did not appear to have been heeded by Saturday afternoon.

Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown by Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, enjoys support from die-hard monarchists in the diaspora but has struggled to gain wider appeal within Iran. However, that has not stopped him from presenting himself as the transitional leader of Iran if the government were to fall.

As its immigration crackdown in Minneapolis intensifies, the Trump administration is leaning into messaging that borrows from phrases, images and music about national identity that have become popular among right-wing groups.

On Jan. 9, two days after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent's shooting of Renee Good sent tensions in Minneapolis to a fever pitch, the Department of Homeland Security posted to social media an image of a man on a horse riding through a snowy, mountainous landscape with the words “We'll have our home again.” That's the chorus to a song about ousting a foreign presence by a self-described “folk-punk” band that the Proud Boys and other far-right and white supremacist groups have used.

The next day, the Department of Labor posted on X: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American.” Several Trump critics on the social media site drew a parallel to a notorious Nazi slogan, “One People, One Realm, One Leader.”

And this past week, as President Donald Trump stepped up his pressure campaign to claim Greenland, the White House posted an image on X that showed a dog sled facing a fork in the trail, one that leads to an American flag and the White House and another that leads to the Russian and Chinese flags. Above the image was the phrase, “Which way, Greenland Man?”

The post refers to a meme that riffs off the title of a notorious white supremacist book titled “Which Way Western Man?” The administration had already used the framing in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement recruiting post last year, which asked, “Which way, American Man?”




The flurry of posts has renewed criticism about a recurring pattern in Trump's second term — the sometimes cryptic use of imagery popular with the far right and white supremacists in the administration's campaign to rally the nation behind its immigration crackdown, which it frames as a battle to preserve Western civilization.

The administration says it's tired of criticism that its messaging is framed around white supremacy or Nazi slogans.

“It seems that the mainstream media has become a meme of their own: The deranged leftist who claims everything they dislike must be Nazi propaganda,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. “This line of attack is boring and tired. Get a grip.”

Referring to the “We'll Have Our Home Again” post, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said it “was a reference to 20-plus million illegal aliens invading the country.”

“I don't know where you guys are getting this stuff,” she added, “but it is absurd.”

César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at Ohio State University, said the administration's references are a choice.

“You don't have to dip into white supremacist sloganeering to promote immigration regulation,” he said, noting that former President Bill Clinton signed two bills toughening penalties on immigrants who were in the country illegally in the 1990s without doing so.

He added that the administration seems to calibrate its references.

“The imagery is not simply a reproduction of common white supremacist imagery or text, but a play on that imagery — and that gives them the breathing room they want,” Garcia Hernández said.

Trump won his second term with robust support from Latino voters and increased his backing among both Black and Asian voters, all while running on pledges of tough border enforcement and mass deportations. 

Still, Trump for years has created enthusiasm among white supremacist groups, who see his nationalist and anti-immigrant stance as validating their own.

The president has complained that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” and spoken favorably about white immigrants compared to other immigrants. In his first term, he bemoaned the number of immigrants coming from what he called “shithole countries” such as Haiti or ones in Africa, while wondering why the U.S. doesn't draw more people from Norway. Last month, he called Somali immigrants “garbage.”

Trump changed immigration policy to favor whites in one area by shutting down the admission of refugees except for white South Africans, whom he contends, against evidence, are being discriminated against in their home country.

Some of Trump's most prominent supporters have openly embraced the cause of white nationalists.

Elon Musk, who was Trump's biggest donor during the 2024 presidential campaign and ran the president's Department of Government Efficiency for the first part of last year, recirculated a user post on X, the social platform he owns, that called for “white solidarity” to prevent the mass murder of white men and added a “100” emoji indicating agreement.

The administration's history has led to claims that it's using white supremacist language even when there is no evidence for it.

In the aftermath of the Good shooting in Minnesota, a sign that appeared on Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's lectern during a news conference — reading “One Of Ours, All Of Yours” — drew widespread attention on social media, with many commentators suggesting it was a Nazi phrase. The Southern Poverty Law Center, however, could not trace the words to any Nazi slogan.

McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, said it was a reference to the subject of the press conference: “a CBP officer who was shot — he was one of our officers and all of the country's federal law enforcement officer,” she wrote in an email.

Hannah Gais, a senior researcher with the SPLC, has long tracked white supremacist groups and said she thinks the administration knows what it's doing with its messaging slogans.

“They know their base is this overly online right-winger who they know will go nuts if they say ‘Which Way, Western Man?'” Gais said. “I don't think it's a tenable strategy for the long term because the stuff is incomprehensible to most people. And if it is comprehensible, people don't like it.”

Sam Darnold is expected to play vs. the 49ers despite having an oblique injury. Jason McIntyre asks if Darnold can lead the 49ers to a victory despite his injury. 

The Seattle Seahawks are set to enter their NFC Divisional Round matchup against the San Francisco 49ers with a major question mark: the health of star quarterback Sam Darnold.

Darnold said he felt something in his oblique while throwing passes during Thursday's practice and stopped throwing. The 28-year-old has not thrown a football since, and the Seahawks believe — but don't know — that he will be ready to start Saturday's game, according to ESPN.

Backup quarterback Drew Lock took Darnold's place and received the first-team reps the last two days and will start if Darnold can't go.

""Didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said Thursday. ""Wasn't the day to push it. That was it. Just came inside, got some rehab. Feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold said it was the first time he has dealt with an oblique issue and that he would be getting treatment on it leading into the game. He remained confident that he would play.

When asked about his chances of sitting out, Darnold said, ""Very low percentage. Probably closer to zero.""

Darnold has been great for the Seahawks in his first season with the team, leading them to a 14-3 record, an NFC West Division title and the No. 1 seed in the NFC. In 17 games, Darnold has completed 67.7% of his passes for 4,048 yards with 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, earning his second straight Pro Bowl selection.

If Darnold cannot play against the 49ers, it would be a major blow. Lock has appeared in five games this season, throwing just three passes.

Lock started five games for the New York Giants last season, going 1-4 with a 59.1% completion percentage and throwing for 1,071 yards with six touchdowns and five interceptions. He has started 28 games in his career, going 10-18.

In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. Published daily by senior writers and experts, these in-depth pieces go beyond the headlines to give readers the full picture. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here.

C'mon, be honest. When scrolling through social media on your phone or when visiting a site online, how often do you read beyond the headline? 

According to a study by Columbia University and Microsoft, only 20% of news consumers read past the headline, albeit not always, while the other 4 out of 5 quickly absorb what they believe is the main crux of a story and move on, almost always. This isn't exactly surprising in an increasingly ADD and instant-gratification culture, especially during a Trump presidency, where the news cycle moves so fast that there's no time to stop and consider the historical impact of major and even unprecedented events. 

Take the bold bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, flawlessly executed by the U.S. military in June 2025, as an example. Going back decades, Republican and Democratic presidents have promised to “do something” about Iran's nuclear program, yet did essentially nothing. Trump, without any American casualties, took out their capabilities without one American casualty, with a mission that took real brass to greenlight. 

But the headlines following Operation Midnight Hammer were profoundly negative, with some questioning if any damage was done to the nuclear sites at all. Meanwhile, others played the fear card by warning of an expanded war in the Middle East and possibly World War III. 

None of that happened. But no matter, because legacy media had a negative narrative to push in what should have been one of Trump's finest hours of any presidency. 

CNN headline: Exclusive Early U.S. intel assessment suggests strikes on Iran did not destroy nuclear sites, sources say

Those “sources” were all anonymous, of course, as is the case with any Trump-related “bombshell.” And almost every other news outlet ran with this exclusive and presented it as an absolute fact. 

It was later confirmed that the facilities were severely damaged. Iran even confirmed this week that it has no plans to attempt to rebuild the sites that were bombed. 

The same situation happened with the capture of narco-terrorist and illegitimate then-Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Again, this was a highly complex and daring mission for the U.S. military to execute by going into what was essentially a military compound to extract Maduro under heavily armed security. 

Much like Iran's nuclear program, Republican and Democratic U.S. presidents of the past had vowed to “do something” about Maduro, with President Joe Biden even putting a $25 million bounty on his capture. But when Trump finally did something, the reflexive criticism from legacy media was laughable. 

Topline premise: “[Arresting Maduro] risks undercutting Trump's push to regain Americans' trust on the economy by handing Democrats a new line for the midterm elections: namely, that Trump and Republicans are fixated on oil and American imperialism rather than on the checking accounts of rank-and-file U.S. citizens.”

In other words, taking Maduro out of power, which was overwhelmingly cheered by every country in the region and the eight million people who fled the country, is supposedly bad for the Red Team… as is freeing up Venezuela's oil reserves. Again, these are all good developments, even economically, but Trump and the GOP apparently will be hurt because they're not focusing on the checking accounts of “rank-and-file U.S. citizens.” 

There are multiple other examples, but you get the point. Arresting a despot, much like Manuel Noriega was back in 1989, is illegal and a “war” for oil because Maduro once said it could be. 

Fast forward to the present day, multiple attacks on ICE agents have occurred in the past 10 days, including one officer who was struck by an SUV driven by 37-year-old activist Renee Nicole Good, who was shot and killed. Per cellphone video from the officer, Good was instructed on multiple occasions to exit her parked vehicle after attempting to block traffic near an ICE staging area, but refused before accelerating into the officer, who, in self-defense, fired his weapon, killing Good. 

DHS later confirmed the officer was treated for internal bleeding in his torso. And this is the same officer who had been dragged 100 feet by another illegal he was attempting to apprehend last June, injuring him to the point where 33 stitches were required. 

Tensions have soared in Minneapolis despite the facts of what occurred between the ICE agent and Good via video evidence. Legacy media, which thrives on violent protests and division, has portrayed Good as an innocent victim, as have prominent Democrats, who have claimed that she was “just trying to get home” or “was just trying to leave” after ICE approached her vehicle and ordered her to exit her vehicle. 

On Wednesday night, there was another shooting where an ICE agent was ambushed by three people, with one swinging a shovel in an effort to hurt or kill the officer. Similar to the Renee Nicole Good situation, the officer acted in self-defense, shooting the attacker in the leg. Both men were sent to the hospital. 

Again, these are the facts. But here's how the New York Times chose to paint the story in its headline: 

Breaking News: A federal agent shot an immigrant in the leg in Minneapolis, federal officials said, one week after an ICE officer killed Renee Good in the city.

The omissions here were blatant and intentional. The “immigrant” is here illegally, yet “illegal” is left out of the headline to portray ICE as an agency targeting legal U.S. citizens. There is no mention that the suspect attacked a federal agent with a potentially deadly weapon, which is why the “immigrant” got shot. Additionally, the story fails to mention Renee Good hitting an ICE officer with her SUV, prompting his justified reaction. 

The Times would go on to update its piece four times, but still somehow landed on this beauty: 

“Federal Agent Shoots Man in Minneapolis, Prompting Tense Protests.”

There are no words. 

At the Washington Post, where Democracy, apparently, dies in darkness, the publication decided to wait until the 19th paragraph to share a very crucial tidbit: “As an officer caught up with the suspect, two other people came out of a nearby property and began attacking the officer with a snow shovel and broom handle, according to DHS. 

Yes, 19 whole paragraphs into a story, where this information should have been in the opening paragraph. 

THE OFFICER AND THE ACTIVIST

News organizations have two choices: Push a false narrative through the bias of omission and diminish whatever is left of the media's credibility, or begin to write accurate headlines and include the most crucial facts.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","‘Maybe DHS Was a Bad Idea'","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/dhs-homeland-security-ice-minnesota/685657/","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 12:00:00 GMT","

Two decades after its founding, the department has become what its critics feared.

“We don't do politics in the Department of Homeland Security,” Tom Ridge, the nation's first DHS secretary, liked to say whenever reporters would ask how he handled pressure from the White House. Ridge, a moderate Republican and a Vietnam vet with a square jaw and gentle manner, was the governor of Pennsylvania when nearly 3,000 Americans were killed on September 11, 2001. The nation was gripped with fear and horror, and President George W. Bush put the bipartisanship-seeking Ridge in charge of making sure there wouldn't be another terrorist strike. The new Cabinet-level entity that he would lead mashed together more than 20 federal agencies under one Orwellian name.

I've spoken with Ridge a few times over the years about DHS's origins, and I thought of him on New Year's Eve, when a serene image popped up on the department's social-media accounts showing a classic car on a sandy beach with palm trees and a banner that read America After 100 Million Deportations, along with the caption: “The peace of a nation no longer besieged by the third world.” It was chilling to see DHS, founded to protect Americans from attacks by foreign terrorists, fantasizing breezily about the removal of nearly one-third of the U.S. population, which would have to include tens of millions of citizens. The department has published many provocative posts since President Trump took office last year, but nothing that perverse.

Ridge is now 80 and has mostly retired from public life following a 2021 stroke. I wasn't able to speak with him about the current direction of the department or about the image, which has more than 20 million views. But I expect that it would trouble him to see how the department whose public communications once focused on terror-threat levels, has turned against Americans and been twisted into a trolling operation infused with white nationalism.

A week after the “100 million” post, the ICE officer Jonathan Ross killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. Federal investigators were still gathering evidence at the scene when DHS accused Good of “domestic terrorism.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Vice President Vance, and other Trump officials quickly echoed the characterization. For Americans who remember the visceral trauma of 9/11, terrorism is a concept with a particular gravity. But DHS has now applied the label to Good, a middle-aged American mom in a battered Honda with a glove box full of stuffed animals.

“Terrorism is such a powerful label,” Tom Warrick, a former DHS policy official who worked under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Trump, told me this week. “Applying that to Renee Good just defies the average American's understanding of what that term ought to mean.”

DHS's mission to protect Americans from terrorism enjoyed broad bipartisan support after 9/11. The department's agencies benefited from a renewed national admiration for firefighters, police officers, and others in uniform who served their communities. DHS leaders took cues from the Pentagon and sought to project an aura of nonpartisan patriotism, ensuring support from Democrats and Republicans alike. The very term homeland security, which wasn't universally admired, was meant to evoke something shared that every American would want to protect.

When I asked Jeh Johnson, who was the DHS secretary during Obama's second term, about this mission, he told me about riding Amtrak one day between Washington and New Jersey. He had a gym bag emblazoned with DHS. It caught the eye of a family sitting nearby that included a little boy. “Toward the end of the trip—and his parents clearly put him up to it—the little boy walked across the aisle,” Johnson recounted, “and said to me, ‘Sir, thank you for keeping us safe.'”

“That was the first instinct of people when they thought of Homeland Security: They keep us safe,” Johnson said.

There were fears at the time of DHS's founding, particularly on the political right, that the government was creating an authoritarian monster. The United States had never had the kind of all-encompassing domestic-security apparatus common in autocracies, whose interior departments function as political police. DHS skeptics worried that civil liberties would be vulnerable to abuse if the government began assembling national databases and an expanded federal police force. Those fears were swept aside by the broader anxieties of Americans eager for a consolidated department to protect them from another 9/11-style attack. The FBI remained within the Department of Justice, in part to assuage concerns that DHS could someday become too powerful and omniscient.

Every year, the DHS secretary, along with the FBI director and the head of the National Counterterrorism Center, provides a public briefing to lawmakers on worldwide threats to the United States. By 2021, domestic terror threats had surpassed foreign ones, according to the FBI. Mass shootings motivated by racism and hate killed dozens in El Paso, Texas; Charleston, South Carolina; Pittsburgh; and other cities. After the attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob on January 6, 2021, then–FBI Director Christopher Wray took the unprecedented step of calling it an act of domestic terrorism. But even then, DHS officials remained hesitant to apply the label at home. They preferred the term domestic violent extremism to avoid calling Americans terrorists.

Trump has deployed 3,000 federal officers and agents to Minneapolis this month, the largest operation in DHS history. The city's elected leaders say that they don't want them there. Many of the ICE officers and Border Patrol agents are outfitted in tactical gear and wear body armor and masks, and they're using the technological tools that the department acquired to protect the country's borders: surveillance drones, facial-recognition apps, phone-cracking software. Powered by billions of dollars in new funding, they are making immigration arrests and grabbing protesters who try to stop them.

A few DHS veterans told me that America's immigration politics were already divisive when the department was founded. But its counterterrorism mission mostly overshadowed those forces for the first decade or so. Later, its border and immigration-enforcement agencies received more and more resources and attention, especially after 2014, when Central American children and families began streaming across the Rio Grande. The trend accelerated when Trump first took office.

Stewart Baker, the first DHS policy chief under Bush, told me that he thought the shift occurred during the tenure of Kirstjen Nielsen, who became the department's secretary in late 2017. Nielsen had a background in cybersecurity and had served as chief of staff to General John F. Kelly, Trump's first pick to lead DHS. When Nielsen testified before Congress, many lawmakers' questions were about immigration enforcement, particularly Trump's family-separation policy at the border. Nielsen, who did not respond to an interview request, would sometimes joke that she welcomed inquiries about any other topic. (DHS is also home to the Transportation Security Administration, FEMA, the Secret Service, the Coast Guard, and other agencies.)

Read: Why they mask

“Nobody could take that job after that without expecting to be the face of immigration policy,” Baker said. “That was going to be your job, and if you didn't want to do that, then you really shouldn't be taking the job.”

The change, Baker said, was partly the result of DHS's success at preventing another major terrorist attack. “People tend to think that's yesterday's problem,” he said. “We have lost the sense, as a country, that DHS is carrying out a protective mission that is in the interest of all Americans.”

Baker said that he also attributed the shift to Democrats' evolving attitudes toward immigration enforcement. “There has been a dramatic change in terms of a reluctance to enforce immigration law,” Baker added, describing it as “an uneasy sense that there is something racist about preferring the people who live here over people who don't.”

That opposition to once-uncontroversial elements of immigration enforcement has spread. “It's not just a principle of the Democratic Party,” Baker said. “It's now a fighting principle in the streets.”

Seth Stodder was crossing the Queensborough Bridge in New York City when a plane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center on 9/11. A young attorney with a background in trade policy, he arrived at the federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan and was three blocks away when the towers fell. Stodder joined the government two weeks later. He went on to work for Customs and Border Protection under Bush and DHS under Obama, remaking U.S. border policy to tighten security without choking off trade and travel.

Stodder, who now teaches law at the University of Southern California, told me that he's watched immigration-enforcement agencies' city-by-city crackdown with dismay. “In creating DHS, we didn't want to create the KGB or the FSB,” he said, referring to the Soviet secret-police agency and its current Russian manifestation.

The legal authorities that ICE officers and Border Patrol agents are using to detain and question people on the streets are not new, Stodder said. But those agencies have never been deployed this way domestically. At national-security conferences and in classrooms, he's received many questions over the years about threats to civil liberties from America's expanding array of surveillance tools and software innovations. “My answer to questions was always: Well, we have a constitutional framework here,” he said

Read: How do you prove your citizenship? ICE won't say.

Stodder told me that this now seems naive. “You have these institutions and these technologies and these authorities,” he said, “then some guy like Trump or Stephen Miller can say, Hey, we could use this stuff to do something that nobody's ever done before in the United States. To suddenly see DHS become this kind of mechanism of authoritarian intimidation and incipient fascism is disorienting, and frightening.”

Stodder added: “It makes me think that maybe DHS was a bad idea.”

I asked Johnson, the former DHS secretary, what he thought of the renewed calls by some Democratic lawmakers to scrap ICE, and what they could mean for the future of the department. He told me that the answer lies in changing the agency's policies and personnel—not in getting rid of it entirely. “If you don't like the Vietnam War,” he told me, “you don't get rid of the Department of Defense.”

Ross, the ICE officer who killed Good, had a sterling DHS career. A college graduate and an Iraq War veteran, he joined the Border Patrol in 2007, working first near El Paso targeting smuggling organizations and drug traffickers. He joined ICE in 2015, as border agents often do when they're seeking a less lonely, less isolated assignment closer to a major city. At ICE, Ross became a highly trained tactical officer, the kind the agency sends to handle its riskiest assignments. He'd nearly been killed when he was dragged by a car while attempting to make an arrest seven months earlier, according to the department, and he was back on the job.

We don't know what was going through Ross's head as he recorded Good on his phone and reached for his weapon. As Good attempted to drive away, Ross opened fire. Ross had nearly two decades of Homeland Security service at that point. He killed an American citizen, on a residential street in an American city, and as Good's car careened away, a voice could be heard—reportedly Ross's—saying, “Fucking bitch.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Is Bitcoin a Millionaire Maker?","https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/17/is-bitcoin-a-millionaire-maker/","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 15:15:00 GMT","

The world's leading cryptocurrency has made early adopters incredibly wealthy.

Bitcoin (BTC +0.47%) is ready to start the new year on a better footing. It had a disappointing showing in 2025 as its price dipped about 6% while the stock market put up a double-digit percentage total return. And a competing store-of-value asset, gold, soared last year. Investors might be down on Bitcoin's prospects in the face of these better performances. 

It's always a smart idea for investors to take a step back and understand the bigger picture. When they do this, they will still have a positive view of Bitcoin. But is the world's most dominant cryptocurrency a millionaire-maker investment opportunity? 

Image source: Getty Images.

It's important to look at where Bitcoin has been in the past. This is one of the best-performing assets in recent history. Data from BlackRock, the gargantuan investment manager that has trillions of dollars in assets under management, shows that Bitcoin produced a better return than all other asset classes in eight of the 11 years from the start of 2013 to the end of 2023. And in 2024, the digital asset climbed 119%. That's an impressive track record that's hard to argue with. 

Bitcoin is a global macro asset whose price is influenced by market sentiment and changing liquidity. Over any shorter time horizon, things can fluctuate. The longer-term picture, however, is impossible to ignore. Bitcoin's price has skyrocketed 21,140% in the past decade (as of Jan. 13). 

In the early days, Bitcoin was viewed as an extremely risky asset. I think the risk subsides with each passing year. For starters, the network remains incredibly robust in its security. Beyond that, Bitcoin's hash rate, the amount of computing power that miners are deploying to help process transactions on the blockchain, has been growing remarkably steadily. This is a key fundamental metric.

Bitcoin is being integrated into the traditional financial system. Investment vehicles and payment methodologies are the most obvious examples here. And it seems Bitcoin is being viewed more favorably by politicians as time passes. 

Looking out a decade or beyond, I have confidence that Bitcoin will continue on this path. Companies will keep finding ways to innovate and adopt Bitcoin. And there will be greater regulatory acceptance. These trends will support Bitcoin being a less risky asset to own. 

For an asset to make its investors into millionaires, it probably needs a 100-fold gain during the next 25 years. This translates to a superb 20% annualized return. And it means that a $10,000 starting cash outlay will rise to $1 million.

Viewed through this lens, does Bitcoin have what it takes to bring investors to the promised land? I wholeheartedly believe that it does. That 20% annualized gain actually would be a deceleration for Bitcoin based on its past returns. However, it's critical that investors who buy this asset do their homework and truly understand what they own. 

To be clear, though, no one has any clue what the price of Bitcoin will be. The biggest bull out there is Michael Saylor, founder and executive chairman of Strategy. His price target of $21 million in 2046 is more than 215 times Bitcoin's current price of about $97,000. If his forecast is accurate, an investment of about $4,500 today will make you a millionaire in 20 years. This is an extremely optimistic scenario. 

Making price predictions is a difficult game to play. At the end of the day, Bitcoin has had tremendous upside over the long run. And it can lift the prospects of a diversified portfolio.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","XRP Poised To Move On Its Own, Separate From Bitcoin: CEO","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:b8177f924094b:0-xrp-poised-to-move-on-its-own-separate-from-bitcoin-ceo/","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 09:00:20 GMT","

For a market that usually moves in one direction, some voices are starting to say this time might look a little different. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg said XRP could move on a different path from Bitcoin this year, pointing to enterprise use cases as a key reason.

He made the remarks during a podcast with host Paul Barron, and outlined a cautious view of Bitcoin while singling out protocols tied to real-world tokenization.

According to McClurg, the shift in focus toward practical applications may help a small set of tokens behave differently than the wider market.

XRP And Hedera Seen As Practical Picks

McClurg named the XRP Ledger and Hedera as examples of networks that could benefit from enterprise adoption and tokenization efforts.

He argued that platforms with clear utility — like payment rails, tokenized assets, or stablecoin infrastructure — have a better chance of holding value when speculative momentum fades.

Reports have disclosed that he does not expect these assets to race higher; instead, modest gains are the likeliest outcome, with growth described as low double-digit rather than explosive.

Bitcoin Faces Additional Downside

McClurg turned more negative on Bitcoin. He said he believes Bitcoin peaked on October 6, 2025, at $126,200. Since that date Bitcoin has slipped roughly 35% to about $95,800.

He warned that prices could fall another 20–30% over the next six to nine months, which would place BTC roughly between $65,000 and $77,000 before the end of the cycle.

Based on his view, a new all-time high is not expected in 2026 and the market may be entering a deeper correction. Markets Could Still Move Together 

Critics point out that altcoins often suffer greater losses when the market experiences a downturn, and history supports that caution.

Liquidity tends to dry up during big Bitcoin sell-offs, and even assets with real use cases can be pushed lower in a broad risk-off episode.

In layman's phrasing, XRP might fall less than Bitcoin and therefore look stronger in comparison, but outright independence from Bitcoin is rare and usually temporary.Relative Outperformance The More Likely Outcome 

According to McClurg's perspective, what is most realistic is relative outperformance rather than complete separation. That means XRP and similar tokens could remain flat or show modest positive returns while Bitcoin weakens.

Such a pattern would still be notable for holders and for enterprises planning tokenization projects, but it falls short of a dramatic price surge.

Written by Aaryamann Shrivastava

Ethereum price recently broke out of a bullish triangle pattern, suggesting renewed upside momentum. 

However, that breakout now appears vulnerable. ETH has printed a bearish divergence for nearly three weeks, raising concerns that the move lacks conviction.

Ethereum has shown a clear bearish divergence over the past three weeks, signaling weakening internal strength. While the ETH price continued forming higher highs, the Chaikin Money Flow indicator posted higher lows. This pattern suggests price appreciation occurred alongside rising capital outflows rather than sustained inflows.

Such divergence often precedes a trend reversal. Investors appear to be distributing ETH into strength instead of accumulating. As capital exits the market during price expansion, upside momentum erodes. This dynamic increases the probability of a failed breakout, especially in a cautious broader crypto environment.

Macro data reinforces the bearish signal seen in momentum indicators. Ethereum whales have increased selling activity during the past week. Wallets holding between 100,000 and 1 million ETH sold more than 230,000 ETH, according to on-chain data.

This selling pressure equals roughly $760 million at current prices. Large wallet outflows align with the declining CMF, confirming reduced confidence among major holders. When whales sell into breakouts, price sustainability weakens, increasing the likelihood of further downside in the near term.

Ethereum price trades near $3,309 at the time of writing, holding just above the $3,287 support level. The recent triangle breakout projected a 29.5% upside move, targeting $4,240. However, fading momentum and bearish divergence threaten to invalidate that bullish structure.

Given current conditions, ETH is likely to lose the $3,287 support. A breakdown would send the price toward the $3,131 level, confirming the move as a fakeout. Such a rejection would increase selling pressure and suggest a deeper correction below $3,000 could follow.

Still, the downside is not guaranteed. If ETH successfully bounces from $3,287 and whale selling subsides, bullish momentum could return. 

Holding that support may allow Ethereum to push toward $3,441. Further strength could extend gains toward $3,802, invalidating the bearish outlook.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Analysts see diminishing Cardano's strength amid the rise of Remittix Platform","https://crypto.news/analysts-see-diminishing-cardanos-strength-amid-the-rise-of-remittix-platform/","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 18:03:40 GMT","

As markets turn selective, Bitcoin consolidates while capital shifts from Cardano toward PayFi projects like Remittix.

The top altcoin to buy debate has shifted in recent weeks as market sentiment across the crypto market becomes more selective. Bitcoin continues consolidating within a clearly structured range, while most altcoins still fail to overcome the barrier toward renewed growth. 

As this is the case, investors start to pay closer attention to projects that demonstrate real-world utility and visible product delivery. Cardano has been one of the leading blockchain projects for quite some time now; however, growing interest in PayFi-focused platforms such as Remittix (RTX) starts to reshape the way capital is allocated across digital assets.

Cardano is currently priced around $0.3960, down by almost 5.33%, with a market cap of $14.24 billion and a 24-hour volume of $741.92 million, down 23.14%. In the analysis of the crypto market, ADA is still being pressurized below the descending trend line and has been repeatedly rejected around the 50-day EMA of $0.4158.

However, Price has retreated to just above an important area of support at $0.3826, corresponding to its January 3 bottom. A daily close below this area could signal a further fall to $0.3294, although this would be indicative of deteriorating market sentiment and not a further bull rally in the crypto market. 

This is because momentum indicators also suggest that this is not a strong moment in the market; otherwise, a breakout to the upside would be seen.

A short-term rally towards the 50-day EMA may occur if ADA can hold above support. Still, many traders no longer view Cardano as the clear top altcoin to buy, especially as newer platforms demonstrate faster execution and clearer use cases within decentralized finance and payments.

As attention shifts, Remittix is gaining visibility as a utility-driven cryptocurrency built around payments and crypto adoption. The RTX token is currently priced at $0.123, with over $28.8 million raised through private funding and more than 701.4 million tokens sold.

Unlike many altcoins still focused on future roadmaps, Remittix already has a working product, with its wallet now live on the Apple App Store.

This progress places Remittix in a different category within the crypto market. Rather than competing on hype, the project is focused on solving real payment challenges by bridging crypto and traditional finance through its PayFi model, with a full platform launch scheduled for 9 February 2026, as announced in this official update from the Remittix team.

Remittix's rise as a potential top altcoin to buy is tied to execution, security, and utility rather than speculation.

Security, transparency, and other factors have become big drivers in crypto regulation expectations, meaning third-party audits have become an important factor in this arena. Remittix has been fully audited by CertiK and has become #1 in CertiK for pre-launch tokens in crypto, which is an unusual position to have in today's crypto market environment.

This degree of validation further enhances the element of trust, particularly when many altcoins face a lack of confidence, thus reinforcing the reasons many are reassessing the top altcoin to purchase in the market cycle.

Cardano remains a major name in blockchain technology, yet its recent technical weakness highlights how quickly the altcoin hierarchy can change. As crypto adoption continues to favor usable products, platforms like Remittix are drawing attention for tangible progress rather than long-term narratives.

For investors tracking the top altcoin to buy, the contrast between ADA's consolidation and Remittix's steady rollout reflects a broader shift toward execution-led projects as the market prepares for its next phase.

For more information, visit the official website or socials.  

There is no single answer, but projects showing real utility, audits, and live products are gaining stronger attention in the current crypto market.

Market volatility has pushed crypto investors to focus on execution, adoption, and working products rather than long-term promises alone.

Cryptocurrencies that solve practical problems, such as payments and transfers, tend to align better with long-term adoption trends.

The next AI revolution could start with world models

Why today's AI systems struggle with consistency, and how emerging world models aim to give machines a steady grasp of space and time

By Deni Ellis Béchard edited by Eric Sullivan

liulolo

You've probably seen an artificial intelligence system go off track. You ask for a video of a dog, and as the dog runs behind the love seat, its collar disappears. Then, as the camera pans back, the love seat becomes a sofa.

Part of the problem lies in the predictive nature of many AI models. Like the models that power ChatGPT, which are trained to predict text, video generation models predict what is statistically most plausible to look right next. In neither case does the AI hold a clearly defined model of the world that it continuously updates to make more informed decisions.

But that's starting to change as researchers across many AI domains work on creating “world models,” with implications that extend beyond video generation and chatbot use to augmented reality, robotics, autonomous vehicles and even humanlike intelligence—or artificial general intelligence (AGI).

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

A simple way to understand world modeling is through four-dimensional, or 4D, models (three dimensions plus time). To do this, let's think back to 2012, when Titanic, 15 years after its theatrical release, was painstakingly converted into stereoscopic 3D. If you were to freeze any frame, you would have an impression of distance between characters and objects on the ship. But if Leonardo DiCaprio had his back to the camera, you wouldn't be able to walk around him to see his face. Cinema's illusion of 3D is made using stereoscopy—two slightly different images often projected in rapid alternation, one for the left eye and one for the right. Everyone in the cinema sees the same pair of images and thus a similar perspective.

Multiple perspectives are, however, increasingly possible thanks to the past decade of research. Imagine realizing you should have shot a photo from a different angle and then having AI make that adjustment, giving the same scene with a new perspective. Starting in 2020, NeRF (neural radiance field) algorithms offered a path to create “photorealistic novel views” but required combining many photos so that an AI system could generate a 3D representation. Other 3D approaches use AI to fill in missing information predictively, deviating more from reality.

Now, imagine that every frame in Titanic were represented in 3D so that the movie existed in 4D. You could scroll through time to see different moments or scroll through space to watch it from different perspectives. You could also generate new versions of it. For instance, a recent preprint, “NeoVerse: Enhancing 4D World Model with in-the-Wild Monocular Videos,” describes one way of turning videos into 4D models to generate new videos from different perspectives.

But 4D techniques can also help generate new video content. Another recent preprint, “TeleWorld: Towards Dynamic Multimodal Synthesis with a 4D World Model,” applies to the scenario with which we began: the dog running behind the love seat. The authors argue that the stability of AI video systems improves when a continuously updated 4D world model guides generation. The system's 4D model would help to prevent the love seat from becoming a couch and the dog from losing its collar.

These are early results, but they hint at a broader trend: models that update an internal scene map as they generate. Yet 4D modeling has applications far beyond video generation. For augmented reality (AR)—think Meta's Orion prototype glasses—a 4D world model is an evolving map of the user's world over time. It allows AR systems to keep virtual objects stable, to make lighting and perspective believable and to have a spatial memory of what recently happened. It also allows for occlusions—when digital objects disappear behind real ones. A 2023 paper puts the requirement bluntly: “To achieve occlusion, a 3D model of the physical environment is required.”

Being able to rapidly convert videos into 4D also provides rich data for training robots and autonomous vehicles on how the real world works. And by generating 4D models of the space they're in, robots could navigate it better and predict what might happen next. Today's general-purpose vision-language AI models—which understand images and text but do not generate clearly defined world models—often make errors; a benchmark paper presented at a 2025 conference reports “striking limitations” in their basic world-modeling abilities, including “near-random accuracy when distinguishing motion trajectories.”

Here's the catch: “world model” means much more to those pursuing AGI. For instance, today's leading large language models (LLMs), such as those powering ChatGPT, have an implicit sense of the world from their training data. “In a way, I would say that the LLM already has a very good world model; it's just we don't really understand how it's doing it,” says Angjoo Kanazawa, an assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at University of California, Berkeley. These conceptual models, though, aren't a real-time physical understanding of the world because LLMs can't update their training data in real time. Even OpenAI's technical report notes that, once deployed, its model GPT-4 “does not learn from experience.”

“How do you develop an intelligent LLM vision system that can actually have streaming input and update its understanding of the world and act accordingly?” Kanazawa says. “That's a big open problem. I think AGI is not possible without actually solving this problem.”

Though researchers debate whether LLMs could ever attain AGI, many see LLMs as a component of future AI systems. The LLM would act as the layer for “language and common sense to communicate,” Kanazawa says; it would serve as an “interface,” whereas a more clearly defined underlying world model would provide the necessary “spatial temporal memory” that current LLMs lack.

In recent years a number of prominent AI researchers have turned toward world models. In 2024 Fei Fei Li founded World Labs, which recently launched its Marble software to create 3D worlds from “text, images, video, or coarse 3D layouts,” according to the start-up's promotional material. And last November AI researcher Yann LeCun announced on LinkedIn that he was leaving Meta to launch a start-up, now called Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI Labs), to build “systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.” He seeded these ideas in a 2022 position paper in which he asked why humans can act well in situations they've never encountered and argued the answer “may lie in the ability... to learn world models, internal models of how the world works.” Research increasingly shows the benefits of internal models. An April 2025 Nature paper reported results on DreamerV3, an AI agent that, by learning a world model, can improve its behavior by “imagining” future scenarios.

So while in the context of AGI, “world model” refers more closely to an internal model of how reality works, not just 4D reconstructions, advances in 4D modeling could provide components that help with understanding viewpoints, memory and even short-term prediction. And meanwhile, on the path to AGI, 4D models can provide rich simulations of reality in which to test AIs to ensure that when we do let them operate in the real world, they know how to exist in it.

Antonio Conte has slammed sacked Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim's “arrogant” handling of Rasmus Hojlund, accusing the Portuguese of failing to “adapt” his rigid methods to the striker's qualities. The Denmark international has been in fine form since swapping Old Trafford for Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, scoring nine goals in all competitions for the Serie A side.

After struggling to find consistency in front of goal under Amorim's stewardship, Hojlund was told he was surplus to requirements at United last summer. 

The 22-year-old - who scored just 10 goals in 52 appearances in 2024-25 - was keen to stay and fight for his place at the Red Devils, only to be pushed closer to the exit door.

But after joining Italian champions Napoli on loan with an obligation to buy in September, Hojlund has not looked back after flourishing under Conte's tutelage.

The former Atalanta striker has scored six goals in 16 appearances in the league this season, while he has netted twice in five Champions League games and once in the Supercoppa Italiana, which the Partenopei won following their 2-0 victory over Bologna in December.

While Hojlund has been thriving in Naples, Amorim was dismissed by United at the start of January. The ex-Sporting CP boss was relieved of his duties after a breakdown in relations with the club's hierarchy, with the 40-year-old's preferred 3-4-3 system reportedly drawing criticism from the boardroom.

United - who have since named former player Michael Carrick as their caretaker manager until the end of the season - said in a statement after Amorim's sacking: “With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change.

“This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future.”

And following his departure from United, Amorim's treatment of Hojlund has been greeted with a scathing attack by Conte.

Speaking ahead of Napoli's home clash against Sassuolo in the league on Saturday, the former Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur manager said: “Some young coaches nowadays are arrogant and don't want to adapt. They see a young striker struggling, and instead of training him, they blame him.

“They always complain and blame everyone but themselves, because everything is handed to them on a silver platter.”

While Hojlund, Conte and Napoli try to keep pace with Serie A leaders Inter Milan by beating Sassuolo this weekend, United - on the other hand - will look to secure a morale-boosting victory over rivals Manchester City in Saturday's derby in the Premier League.

Speaking ahead of his first game in charge since replacing Amorim, Carrick - who represented the club as a player between 2006 and 2018 - said: “Listen, I'm here because I enjoy the role and I wanted to do it and I'm hugely privileged to be in this position. So that's kind of where I am. It doesn't change whatever the term, whatever the length, I'm here to do my best. Hopefully, I've got a lot of experience of what it takes and where we need to get to and I'll try and help with that.”

Inheriting a United side who are low on confidence following their FA Cup third round loss against Brighton and Hove Albion last weekend, Carrick says his arrival is a “fresh start” for his players, who are currently seventh in the league and just three points behind fourth-placed Liverpool in the race for Champions League qualification.

“I've got a lot of belief in that, and as I've just said, confidence and a feeling, and things can go in a different direction very quickly, and I've got a lot of belief in the boys,” former Middlesborough manager Carrick added. “I'm not going to tell you everything about how we're going to do it because I'd be a bit silly to do that, but I think tactically and as a team, what we want to look like and things that we feel can help us and be hugely positive in what we can achieve.”","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Liverpool player ratings vs Burnley: Poor week for Dominik Szoboszlai continues as missed penalty proves costly as Reds drop more points despite Florian Wirtz magic","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/liverpool-player-ratings-burnley-dominik-szoboszlai-missed-penalty-florian-wirtz-magic/blt0ce839249322173b","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 17:09:28 GMT","

Liverpool were held to a disappointing 1-1 draw by relegation-threatened Burnley after Dominik Szoboszlai missed a penalty in a match where Arne Slot's side squandered countless opportunities. Florian Wirtz fired the Reds in front, but it was a brilliantly taken strike from Marcus Edwards that earned the second bottom side a precious point. 

Liverpool enjoyed the vast majority of possession in the opening stages, but Slot's side could only manage a few half-chances until they were awarded a penalty on the half-hour mark after Florentino hacked down Cody Gakpo. Szoboszlai stepped up to take it, but thrashed his effort onto the crossbar, his miss coming just five days after a poor error against Barnsley in the FA Cup. 

The Reds continued to press and were well worth their lead when the deadlock was broken 12 minutes after the missed penalty, courtesy of a fine finish from Wirtz. Hugo Ekitike broke down the left before Curtis Jones neatly found the German to thrash home from just inside the penalty area.

Liverpool would have expected to make their dominance pay, but Burnley had an excellent chance to bring the match level just after the restart when Edwards curled his shot just wide of Alisson's goal. He didn't have long to wait to bring the visitor's level, though, as the former Sporting CP winger did brilliantly to cut into the box and fire low across Alisson to send the travelling fans wild in a season which has offered so few moments of joy for Scott Parker's side. 

The home fans voiced their displeasure at the final whistle after watching their side drop more points at home, as the draw means all three newly-promoted sides have taken a point on their visits to Anfield this season.

GOAL rates Liverpool's players from Anfield...

Alisson Becker (6/10):

Barely had anything to do until Burnley's first shot on target. Will be disappointed that Edwards' shot squeezed underneath his dive. 

Jeremie Frimpong (7/10):

Played very high up the pitch and had an excellent chance to score in the second half.

Ibrahima Konate (6/10):

Didn't have much to do throughout, was a solid if uninspiring performance.

Virgil van Dijk (7/10):

Had little to do and was one of just two Liverpool players whose average position was in his own half.

Milos Kerkez (8/10):

Had an early chance to fire the Reds in front, his low cross was cleared off the line and away for a corner. Booked for an untidy lunge on Anthony. Subbed off with ten minutes to go. 

Dominik Szoboszlai (6/10):

A strange afternoon as he played well, but smashed his penalty against the Burnley crossbar. He'll be glad to see the back of January following that mistake against Barnsley. 

Ryan Gravenberch (6/10):

Saw lots of the ball in the middle of midfield, but became sloppy with his passing as the second half progressed and was subbed off for Mac Allister. 

Curtis Jones (8/10):

An industrious afternoon and was at the heart of so much Liverpool did well. Provided the assist for Wirtz's goal.

Florian Wirtz (8/10):

Took his goal very well, showing once again the undoubted quality he has, but didn't do enough aside from that.

Cody Gakpo (6/10):

Was a lively presence on the left for Liverpool and was chief creator for the majority of the match. Had a couple of half-chances which went begging. Hooked off for Ngumoha with a few minutes left. 

Hugo Ekitike (7/10):

Was a constant thorn in Burnley's side, but wasted a couple of golden opportunities, including an excellent header in the first half. 

Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting

Andy Robertson (6/10):

Had very little to do when he came on. Enjoyed a few touches as Liverpool pressed for the winner. 

Alex Mac Allister (6/10):

Brought on with only a handful of minutes remaining and wasted a golden chance when he fired high over the bar. 

Rio Ngumoha (6/10):

A lively presence when he came on, but had too few chances to make an impact. 

Federico Chiesa (N/A):

Brought on with only a few seconds remaining. 

Arne Slot (5/10):

Another disappointing result. Another below-par performance at home, despite the missed penalty and a host of chances. He really should've made changes earlier in the match. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

	As Heated Rivalry takes the world by storm, including parts of the actual NHL, François Arnaud hopes it leads to actual change.


	The actor, who plays gay hockey star Scott Hunter on the Crave/HBO Max series, noted that the league is “actually really good at capitalizing” on the success of the Jacob Tierney-created gay hockey romance, but hopes they start to “back it up” with meaningful LGBTQ support.


	“Their sales are going up apparently, and the Boston Bruins tagged us in different clips online, and it's getting incredible traction,” he noted on SiriusXM's Radio Andy. “I'm just hoping that it's backed up by actual openness to diversity.”

	Arnaud added, “I think they banned [players] from wearing a Pride band a few years ago. So like, if you're gonna use our name, back it up with real-life sh*t.”


	Before the adaptation of Rachel Reid's Game Changer book series was renewed for Season 2, Arnaud spoke to Deadline about the show's sudden success across multiple audiences.


	“It's the kind of thing that I'm already like, my cortisol levels are pretty high naturally. So, I like to keep it at arm's length, but I mean, I'm aware of the reaction, and it's insane,” he explained. “And I always believed in the show from the moment I read it, I knew that it would find an audience. I had to convince people that I was working with to let me do this, because I was like, ‘No, no, this is not just a small Canadian show. There's nothing like it, and for sure it'll be like a brush fire.'”

	











	Arnaud continued, “I did not expect it, even though I believed that, I did not expect it to go this fast overnight.”

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	With strong support from the cast of thirtysomething and others, Timothy Busfield has come out forcefully tonight against the child sex abuse charges against him, as well as attempts by prosecutors to keep him behind bars. 


	“The State's attempt to transform responsible self-surrender into aggravating conduct only underscores the absence of genuine evidence of dangerousness,” declares an opposition filing just placed in the New Mexico courts seeking to blunt pre-trial efforts by prosecutors to keep the currently in custody Busfield imprisoned up to and during a trial on the felony claims.

	“The Motion asks the Court to imprison a man based on a story that has already collapsed under independent scrutiny,” the exhibit-heavy document from Albuquerque attorneys Amber Fayerberg and Christopher Dodd says. “The State offers no reliable proof—only allegations advanced by witnesses with documented histories of fraud and financial exploitation, contradicted by a comprehensive studio investigation, and refuted by witnesses and objective risk assessments. The Constitution does not allow liberty to be forfeited on such a foundation. The State's Motion should be denied.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	The lawyers assert: “For all of these reasons—the independent investigation that undermined the State's allegations at every turn, the affirmative findings of the polygraph and ABEL assessment, the overwhelming evidence of character and community support, and the absence of any reliable proof of dangerousness—the State cannot meet its burden of clear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release will reasonably protect the community. The Constitution requires release under appropriate conditions.”

	











	Busfield is looking at possibly a decade in state prison if found guilty on two counts of criminal sexual contact with a minor and child abuse. 


	With at least one new claim emerging in the days after he was charged, the 68-year old Busfield is accused of misconduct with two 2014-born brothers who were actors on episodes of the Albuquerque-filmed The Cleaning Lady that the Emmy winner directed.


	Not long after the U.S. Marshals were called in last week, Busfield arrived in Albuquerque and turned himself in to authorities on January 13, five days after an arrest warrant was issued for him. Being held without bond at the Bernalillo County Metropolitan Detention Center after being arrested and booked, Busfield appeared briefly in Judge Felicia Blea-Rivera's courtroom remotely on January 14. The same day, as Deadline exclusively reported, Busfield was dropped by his longtime agency Innovative Artists.


	In addition to taking swipes at the personal, professional and legal history (father admitted to “conspiracy to commit wire fraud” and was disbarred) of the boys' parents, tonight's filing ahead of a pre-trial detention hearing next week contains a slew of letters from his wife Melissa Gilbert, director Edward Zwick and fellow actors extolling Busfield's virtues.


	“Timothy is my friend, so no doubt I'm biased,” says thirtysomething cast member Ken Olin in a letter included. “But I know him well, through many years and many changing life circumstances, and he has always been a man who cares about other people – old and young. And I know in the very bottom of my heart that Timothy would never do anything to cruelly exploit or harm anyone, let alone a child.”


	Fellow thirtysomething castmates Peter Horton and Patricia Wellig Olin offered similar sentiments.


	As well, a January 15 clinical assessment of Busfield concludes: “Given Mr. Busfield did not have any static or dynamic risk factors identified through the assessment and psychometric tools, it is highly likely that he would abide by any supervision requirements placed on him, if he was released from custody.”


	Despite vehemently declaring his innocence on January 13 and insisting, “I did not do anything to those little boys,” Busfield did not enter a plea at that appearance. The actor, his lawyers (who have noted their client successfully passed a polygraph examination on the claims) and Bernalillo County DA Sam Bergman's office are all expected in District Court in person on January 20 for an early afternoon hearing on the pre-trial detention motion.


	Depending on how that goes, Busfield could walk out on bail or stew in a Land of Enchantment cell for months.

If he's guilty, I hope the prosecution is able to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt.
If he's innocent, I hope the prosecution can't prove he's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
That's really the only position any of us have to have here.

Believe Women and Believe Children!!!!!  These men in Hollywood have gotten away with it for far too long.

What happened to “innocent until proven guilty”?

Free Busfield

Yes – finally we hearing some of the facts that will show this whole thing to be a bogus pile of lies.

Before anyone passes judgement, remember this is the same place where a District Attorney went after another high-profile Hollywood person in order to advance her career by winning a “big” case.  In that one, the DA ended up resigning from the case (which was ultimately dismissed) and getting sanctioned by the State Supreme Court of New Mexico.

Meaning what?

Science and Technology 

The SETI@home project, led by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, has reduced approximately 12 billion radio signals collected since 1999 to just 100 unexplained events after decades of distributed processing, with results consolidated in two scientific articles published in 2025. The Astronomical Journal.

Created in 1999, SETI@home transformed millions of home computers into a distributed scientific network dedicated to analyzing radio signals captured by the Arecibo Observatory. 

The goal was to identify potential signs of extraterrestrial intelligence amidst a volume of data that grew faster than the capacity for human interpretation.

With hind legs, an elongated skull, and a body adapted to the arid soil of Patagonia, the snake Najash rionegrina revealed that snakes once walked on four limbs during the Cretaceous period.

Water has returned to the Oder Delta and, within a few years, wetlands have reappeared, beavers have reshaped rivers, carbon has stopped escaping from the soil, and rare birds have returned, revealing profound ecological changes that are already transforming agricultural landscapes, reducing droughts, and surprising researchers.

After 30 years in orbit, Hubble is losing altitude and could fall to Earth: NASA reveals when this is likely to happen.

Helicopters dump 150 tons of sand into a river in Swedish Lapland to repair centuries-old damage from logging, accelerate the return of insects, fish and mussels, and test whether extreme engineering can revive virtually dead river ecosystems in northern Europe.

For years, the accumulation of detections has exceeded the tools available for in-depth analysis. 

According to David Anderson, a computer scientist at UC Berkeley and co-founder of the project, until approximately 2016 there was no clarity on how to conduct the final stage of interpreting the signals accumulated over time.

The publication of the studies in 2025 marks the culmination of this effort, detailing how researchers were able to move from simple detection to a systematic and comparative analysis of patterns across large portions of the sky.

The articles describe the process that examined billions of candidate detections in search of features consistent with a non-natural origin. The analyzed signals appeared as momentary energy spikes at specific frequencies, originating from specific points in the sky, requiring methods capable of separating potential events of interest from known interference.

To achieve this, the team developed new filtering and classification algorithms designed to eliminate signals associated with satellites, radar, and other ground-based sources. This refinement allowed them to reduce the original dataset to approximately 100 signals considered promising for follow-up observations.

Even with these advances, the volume of data remained a significant obstacle. Astronomer Eric Korpela, also from UC Berkeley, highlighted that a complete investigation of all possible signals still depends on direct human analysis, which limits the speed and scope of the process.

The first article, published in 2025, focuses on data acquisition and processing, detailing the systems of computing The first study addresses the distributed distribution and filtering techniques that have characterized SETI@home throughout its existence. The second study addresses the final analysis and conclusions drawn from this material.

Both studies emphasize methodological transparency, with the availability of open datasets and refined code, allowing other researchers to reproduce or expand the analyses independently. 

The authors state that the project represents the most sensitive search for narrowband signals ever conducted over large areas of the sky.

Anderson stated that, even without a conclusive detection of extraterrestrial intelligence, the project established a new level of sensitivity. 

According to him, any signal above a certain power would have been identified by the methods used, which more precisely defines what can be discarded.

Despite the progress, researchers acknowledge limitations stemming from decisions made early in the project. In the late 1990s, computational capacity constraints influenced choices in data processing, which may have led to the exclusion of potentially relevant signals.

Anderson pointed out that it is still difficult to accurately measure what was discarded during the initial filtration stages. 

He questioned whether some criteria may have eliminated important information along with the noise, acknowledging that these decisions were deliberate, given the technological limitations available in 1999.

The scientist stated that, with additional resources, it would be possible to reanalyze the entire dataset more thoroughly. He acknowledged that errors occurred along the way, a direct result of the technical conditions at the time, which leaves room for uncertainty in the final results.

Even after the drastic reduction of the dataset, the possibility remains that signals of unidentified origin may have gone unnoticed. Anderson admitted that there is still a chance that an indication of extraterrestrial intelligence is present in the analyzed data, but was not captured by the applied filters.

This uncertainty keeps the scientific debate open and reinforces the need for new analytical approaches. The final set of approximately 100 signals itself remains without a definitive explanation, making it a focus of interest for future investigations and complementary observations.

The work conducted by Anderson and Korpela establishes a technical and methodological foundation for the next generation of SETI projects. Future initiatives should incorporate machine learning-assisted signal recognition and expanded telescope networks, broadening analytical capabilities.

The legacy of SETI@home remains as a large-scale scientific experiment that connected public curiosity, distributed computing, and radio astronomy. 

Even with mixed feelings among researchers, including a slight disappointment at not having a confirmed detection, the project marks a milestone in the history of the systematic search for extraterrestrial intelligence, leaving behind a body of data and methods that will continue to be explored.

Delanie Walker has fueled conspiracy theories that an electrical substation beside the 49ers training facility is to blame for San Francisco's injury crisis, with the former  tight end claiming there were even concerns it could cause cancer.

George Kittle became the latest 49ers star to be sidelined after he tore his Achilles tendon against the Philadelphia Eagles. 

Over the past decade, San Francisco has been plagued by injuries and there are theories that electromagnetic field (EMF) waves are affecting players.

The Silicon Valley Power Mission Substation sits next to the 49ers' Santa Clara base and it's claimed the EMF waves can damage tendons and cause soft-tissue damage.

The theory has gathered momentum in the wake of Kittle's Achilles injury and now Walker has poured fuel on the fire.

The tight end was drafted by the 49ers 2006 and remained in San Francisco until 2012. He claims there were concerns over the substation back then.

San Francisco 49ers star George Kittle tore his Achilles tendon against the Philadelphia Eagles

Low-frequency electromagnetic fields can degrade collagen, weaken tendons, and cause soft-tissue damage at levels regulators call ""safe.""We have a real world case study proving this:An NFL team whose practice facility sits next to a massive electrical substation.THREAD 🧵… pic.twitter.com/fOVvrVTu5I

'That's been an issue since I've been there - they talked about moving that electrical substation because when I was there,' he told the Bussin' With The Boys podcast. 

'It was said that it was giving people cancer... so then they pushed it back a little bit and just took some of it away.'

He added: 'You can even feel it sometimes - I don't know what it is - you can feel the energy. And then a transformer exploded one day we were at practice. 

'That s*** sounded like a f***ing bomb went off. I was like: 'This is dangerous"" but they're not going to move it.' 

There are trees near the substation and Walker this week insisted: 'Everything dies where the power station is.'

The retired tight end, 41, claimed that research was done into the possible impact of the site but that players were given guarantees that the practice facility is safe. 

'They would start telling us: this may cause cancer, this is a study they're doing. They had doctors coming up there,' he said.

'We may have signed something, I'm going to be honest,' Walker continued. 'I heard they were like: ""Oh it may make your ligaments weak"" and I'm like: 'God Damn, that's crazy.' And then when I saw the picture I thought: We practiced right there too. that's the craziest s*** ever.'

US health department's new food pyramid places red meat and cheese high in saturated fats over plant-based proteins

The new food pyramid rolled out in US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) places animal-based proteins, including cheese and red meats high in saturated fats, above plant-based proteins, which has raised alarm bells among health and environmental experts.

This rejiggered food pyramid is in line with Kennedy's previous signals that he will recommend increasing saturated fat in US diets as part of the “Make America healthy again” movement.

Dr Cheryl Anderson, an American Heart Association board member and professor at the University of California San Diego, said she was eager to read the new guidelines because “they came out much later than they were supposed to. Typically, the guidelines are released within six months of the secretaries receiving the dietary guidelines advisory committee's report,” which should have meant they were released over the summer.

Anderson said she was pleased to see that some things appeared to be in line with the DGA committee's report, including an emphasis on eating “real food”, decreasing the amount of processed food in the diet, and decreasing added sugars. But she “grew concerned” when she saw the visual of the food pyramid with images of steak and cheese higher, larger and overall much more prominent than images of plant-based proteins like nuts. This visual contradicts the written guidelines on saturated fats.

“I think it will be a challenge to keep saturated fat intake within 10% of overall kilocalories. Now, that, to me, is a confusing message for the American public,” Anderson said.

Chloë Waterman – a senior program manager at Friends of the Earth who focuses on school lunches as well as the connection between diet and the environment – also said that the guidelines are contradictory and lack clarity. She suspects the confusion stems from an attempt to “please all stakeholders” – both public health experts and the Maha movement.

Waterman said the guidelines are unclear because of the contradiction between the text and the visuals and also because “previous iterations of the guidelines were hundreds of pages long, and these guidelines are 10 pages. So, there's only so much clarity you can fit into 10 pages.”

Increased meat consumption would negatively impact the environment as well, Waterman added.

“Americans already eat more protein than is recommended, and we're one of the highest meat-consuming countries in the world. That level of meat consumption has a disastrous impact on the planet, because industrial animal agriculture is extremely resource intensive,” Waterman said.

“When we are getting our calories from animal products, we are getting along with that a bunch of deforestation,” to create space to grow animal feed, as well as “emissions from the animals themselves. Beef and lamb especially have really high methane emissions,” Waterman added. Methane emanates from the poop, burps and farts of cows and other animals, and is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

If Americans would consume more plant-based foods and proteins and less meat, Waterman said it would accomplish two goals at once.

“We're fortunate that those things actually align with each other, that if we shift our diets toward more plant-based foods, that's going to be better for the environment and for health,” she said, noting that the new guidelines move in the opposite direction.

It's unclear how big an impact the guidelines will have on US adults' behavior. Waterman said Americans have tended to ignore past iterations of the DGA that encourage more fruit and vegetable consumption, but “this could be different in the sense that people want to eat more meat and dairy”.

Waterman is most concerned about how the guidelines will affect school lunches, as children who consume them don't have control over whether to follow the guidelines or not. She said that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) must create rules to bring school lunches in compliance with the DGA. However, that process can take years, and Waterman imagines that it would be difficult to increase the amount of meat in school lunches, which are already “dominated by animal products” without also going above the 10% calories from saturated fat limit.

If the USDA does somehow interpret the guidelines so that school lunches contain even more meat, “we're going to see a devastating increase in diet-related chronic diseases for children,” like diabetes and metabolic syndrome, Waterman said. Kennedy has said that fighting childhood obesity is a major component of his Maha initiative. But, Waterman continued: “Promoting full-fat dairy and red meat, as depicted in the food pyramid, is going to have the opposite effect on childhood obesity as Kennedy intends.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller discusses President Donald Trump's maneuvering to take control of Greenland on ‘Hannity.'

A bipartisan, bicameral group of U.S. lawmakers set off to Denmark to reassure the NATO ally amid President Donald Trump's push for a takeover of Greenland.

The group was mostly made of Democrats, but included two Republicans: Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Murkowski, Tillis, Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., and Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., were among those who traveled to Europe for meetings with Danish and Greenlandic officials. Some members of the delegation are expected to go to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week.

""The trip will highlight bipartisan support for our allies in the Kingdom of Denmark and discuss how to deepen this partnership in line with our shared principles of sovereignty and self-determination, and in the face of growing challenges around the world, especially bolstering Arctic security and promoting stronger trade relations between the two countries,"" a statement Shaheen issued prior to the visit read.

TRUMP AFFIRMS US 'WILL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR NATO,' WHILE EXPRESSING DOUBTS ABOUT ALLIANCE

Coons, who led the delegation, underscored the lawmakers' desire to ""reaffirm Congress' commitment"" to Denmark, calling it one of the U.S.'s ""oldest, strongest NATO allies.""

""A great day leading our bipartisan delegation to Copenhagen meeting with Danish and Greenlandic officials to reaffirm Congress' commitment to one of our oldest, strongest NATO allies. In an increasingly unstable world In which our adversaries are cooperating, our alliances are more important than ever,"" he wrote in a post on X.

The visit comes as Trump's renewed push for the U.S. to takeover Greenland continues to draw criticism from both sides of the aisle and some of America's allies.

""That rhetoric doesn't just undermine our bilateral relationship, it undermines the NATO alliance at a time when our adversaries seek to benefit from division,"" Shaheen said during a speech at the University of Copenhagen.

(Ritzau Scanpix/Emil Helms/via Reuters)

TRUMP'S GREENLAND TAKEOVER WOULD LIKELY ENTAIL ENORMOUS PRICE TAG: REPORT

The trip began before Trump announced on Saturday planned tariffs for Denmark and several European nations in a bid to force a deal for the U.S. purchase of Greenland. 

While the lawmakers were visiting, Denmark saw massive protests of crowds voicing their opposition to the U.S. taking the semiautonomous Danish territory. Thousands gathered across the country to show their solidarity with Greenland. The crowds chanted ""Greenland is not for sale"" and held banners with slogans such as ""Hands off Greenland,"" according to Reuters.

""I am very grateful for the huge support we as Greenlanders receive... we are also sending a message to the world that you all must wake up,"" Julie Rademacher, chair of Uagut, an organization for Greenlanders in Denmark, told Reuters.

""Greenland and the Greenlanders have involuntarily become the front in the fight for democracy and human rights,"" she added.

TRUMP EYES ACTION ON GREENLAND, SETTING UP WHITE HOUSE FACE-OFF WITH DENMARK

Trump has insisted that the U.S. needs Greenland for purposes of national security, saying that Russia and China were eyeing the island. 

During her speech at the University of Copenhagen, Shaheen argued that Trump's approach is unnecessary, saying the U.S. already has pathways to secure its interests in the Arctic.

""Anything the president might want — whether it is U.S. bases to defend against Arctic threats or critical minerals deals — the leaders of Denmark and Greenland have made clear they are happy to partner with us. So, the threats are not only unnecessary, they are also counterproductive, and they risk undermining the broader NATO Alliance in the process,"" Shaheen added.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, U.S. ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker pushed back against growing European backlash over Washington's focus on Greenland after France announced new military exercises with Denmark, saying Arctic security is a core American defense interest and that Europe ""has a tendency to overreact.""

Americans appear divided on the idea, however, with 86% of voters nationwide saying they would oppose military action to take over Greenland, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. The survey found that voters opposed any U.S. effort to buy Greenland by a 55%–37% margin, suggesting the idea has yet to gain broad support among American voters.

President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to sue JPMorgan Chase over allegedly ""debanking"" him following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. 

""I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting,"" Trump said in a social media post. ""The Election was RIGGED!""

JPMorgan and the White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

In August, Trump signed an executive order requiring banks to ensure they are not refusing financial services to clients based on religious or political beliefs, a practice known as ""debanking."" 

Trump claimed in a CNBC interview in August, without providing evidence, that he was personally discriminated against by banks. He said JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America refused to take his deposits following his first term in office. 

At the time, JPMorgan said it does not close accounts for political reasons, while Bank of America said it doesn't comment on client matters. BofA also said it would welcome clearer rules from regulators on how to conduct its activities.

Trump and his family have a history of railing against financial institutions for allegedly refusing to work with them on the basis of their political orientation. 

Last year, Donald Trump Jr. said his family had difficulty accessing big bank services — a situation that allegedly prompted the Trumps to enter the cryptocurrency industry. 

""So, [my family] got into crypto, not because it was like, 'hey, this is the next cool thing,' we got into it out of necessity,"" Trump Jr. told CNBC in an interview last June.

JPMorgan shares are down about 5% over the past week, even after the bank on Tuesday topped expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue.

Trump's legal threat against JPMorgan comes as the president, in the same Truth Social post, denied a Journal report on Wednesday that said the president had offered JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon the position of Federal Reserve chairman months ago during a meeting at the White House. 

Dimon took the proposition as a joke, according to the Journal report.

In his post, Trump denied the report, underscoring his reservations about Dimon and JPMorgan. 

""This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,"" he wrote. ""Why wouldn't The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, ""NO,"" and that would have been the end of the story.""

The Journal and JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of normal business hours. 

Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's term ends on May 15.

AI-generated summary reviewed by our newsroom.

When it comes to base camps at the 2026 World Cup, Kansas City is the belle of the ball.

As previously reported by The Star, Argentina's preferred spot for a base camp is Kansas City. While there are three options for base camps in this area, Argentina is said to favor either the Compass Mineral Sporting Fields, where Sporting Kansas City practices, or the KC Women's Soccer Training Complex, which is for the KC Current.

Reports from England said that country's Football Association had started scouting other base-camp locations because of interest from Argentina and the Netherlands, which plays a group-stage match at Arrowhead Stadium.

However, both The Times and The Daily Mail reported Friday that England still hopes to set up its base camp in Kansas City and officially made an official request to FIFA.

This is from the Daily Mail: “FA officials have lodged their bid with FIFA to stay in Kansas City for the tournament itself. The thinking is that the Midwest city will prove ideal thanks to its location, in that it is not too far away from many of the potential venues.

“The Netherlands and Argentina are also looking to base themselves in the Missouri city, which has a wealth of training complexes.”

The third official FIFA base-camp option is at Rock Chalk Park in Lawrence and the University of Kansas' facilities.

The Times said England is waiting for word from FIFA.

“Argentina and the Netherlands are also keen to use Kansas City,” that story said, “favored because it is no more than five hours from the majority of tournament venues, with a decision expected by the end of the month.”

The good news for England, Argentina and the Netherlands: There is room for all three in Kansas City, should FIFA allow it.

Another Daily Mail story noted England could be neighbors with Argentina, which opens defense of its World Cup title at Arrowhead Stadium.

“FIFA's rules dictate that countries whose matches are close to cities are given first choice on the facilities with them,” the Daily Mail reported. “And there are two seeded teams who have a stronger case than England based on logistics. One of those is the Netherlands, who play one match in Kansas City and two in Texas, in Houston and Dallas. The other is Argentina.

“However, there are a number of hotels and training facilities in Kansas City which fit the bill. The city is home to a number of universities with practice complexes, along with NFL powerhouse the Kansas City Chiefs and MLS side Sporting Kansas City. As many as three nations could be based there, with England in the same city as Lionel Messi.”

	While many Star Wars fans hope to see Rian Johnson revisit a galaxy far, far away, fear is not a factor in taking on another chapter.


	Following Kathleen Kennedy‘s Lucasfilm exit interview with Deadline, in which she explained that “he got spooked” from returning to the franchise, Johnson denied that was what held him back after directing Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017), the penultimate in the Skywalker trilogy. 


	“Lol zero spooked, sorry,” wrote Johnson on X.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Kennedy, who has handed the reins over to Dave Filoni and Lynwen Brennan, recently spoke to Deadline about the possibility of Johnson returning after The Last Jedi grossed $1.3B globally for Disney.

	











	“Once he made the Netflix deal and went off to start doing the Knives Out films, that has occupied a huge amount of his time,” she noted. “That's the other thing that happens here. After Shawn [Levy] and I started talking about Star Wars, Stranger Things kicks in and he was completely consumed for a while by that. That's what happened with Rian.”

	Meanwhile, Levy recently wrapped filming on his highly-anticipated Star Wars: Starfighter with Ryan Gosling in the cockpit.


	Kennedy added of Johnson, “And then I do believe he got spooked by the online negativity. I think Rian made one of the best Star Wars movies. He's a brilliant filmmaker and he got spooked. This is the rough part. When people come into this space, I have every filmmaker and actors say to me, ‘What's going to happen?' They're a little scared.”
