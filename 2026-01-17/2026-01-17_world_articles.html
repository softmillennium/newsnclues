                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US health department's new food pyramid places red meat and cheese high in saturated fats over plant-based proteins The new food pyramid rolled out in US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) places animal-based proteins, including cheese and red meats high in saturated fats, above plant-based proteins, which has raised alarm bells among health and environmental experts. This rejiggered food pyramid is in line with Kennedy's previous signals that he will recommend increasing saturated fat in US diets as part of the “Make America healthy again” movement. Dr Cheryl Anderson, an American Heart Association board member and professor at the University of California San Diego, said she was eager to read the new guidelines because “they came out much later than they were supposed to. “I think it will be a challenge to keep saturated fat intake within 10% of overall kilocalories. Now, that, to me, is a confusing message for the American public,” Anderson said. Increased meat consumption would negatively impact the environment as well, Waterman added. That level of meat consumption has a disastrous impact on the planet, because industrial animal agriculture is extremely resource intensive,” Waterman said. “When we are getting our calories from animal products, we are getting along with that a bunch of deforestation,” to create space to grow animal feed, as well as “emissions from the animals themselves. Beef and lamb especially have really high methane emissions,” Waterman added. It's unclear how big an impact the guidelines will have on US adults' behavior. Waterman said Americans have tended to ignore past iterations of the DGA that encourage more fruit and vegetable consumption, but “this could be different in the sense that people want to eat more meat and dairy”. Waterman is most concerned about how the guidelines will affect school lunches, as children who consume them don't have control over whether to follow the guidelines or not. However, that process can take years, and Waterman imagines that it would be difficult to increase the amount of meat in school lunches, which are already “dominated by animal products” without also going above the 10% calories from saturated fat limit. If the USDA does somehow interpret the guidelines so that school lunches contain even more meat, “we're going to see a devastating increase in diet-related chronic diseases for children,” like diabetes and metabolic syndrome, Waterman said. Kennedy has said that fighting childhood obesity is a major component of his Maha initiative. But, Waterman continued: “Promoting full-fat dairy and red meat, as depicted in the food pyramid, is going to have the opposite effect on childhood obesity as Kennedy intends.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He said the tariff will increase to 25% on 1 June. “This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump said. The president's interest in Greenland intensified following the US raid that captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro earlier in January. While he has claimed the Arctic territory's current status poses a national security threat to the US, this has been disputed by US allies, including Denmark. It was an apparent reference to Nato allies deploying troops in Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump's threats to forcefully take the Arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark. Trump suggested, incorrectly, that residents of Greenland “currently have two dogsleds as protection” – and claimed “China and Russia want Greenland” to the detriment of the US. His latest tariff threat comes just eight months after Trump announced that he had struck a trade pact with the UK – and six months after he announced a pact with the European Union. “These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable,” Trump claimed in his post. “Therefore, it is imperative that, in order to protect Global Peace and Security, strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly, and without question.” Trump, who has previously extolled the benefits of tariffs as a negotiating tool, stressed on Saturday that the US was “immediately open to negotiation” with Denmark and any of the countries it was threatening to hit with these new tariffs. His aggressive global trade strategy has raised fears for the US economy, which analysts and policymakers have warned could face significant damage from sweeping tariffs on the world. While the White House has played down such concerns, a vast wave of tariffs unveiled by Trump last spring – when he proclaimed the start of a new era for the US economy – was quickly reversed as global markets fell sharply. But his administration's erratic rollout of other tariffs nevertheless significantly strained US trade ties with the world. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, the highest level since 1935. The Guardian reported that European troops had deployed to Greenland, in part, to establish what a more sustained ground deployment on the territory could look like, and partly to reassure the US that European Nato members were serious about Arctic security. Fewer than one in five of Americans approve of Trump's efforts to acquire Greenland, a poll published on Thursday by Reuters/Ipsos found. Both Democrats and Republicans oppose the effort, and only 4% of Americans think the US should take Greenland using military force.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Things often turn uglier after nightfall, when the convoys return and the protesters sometimes grow angrier, shaking fences and occasionally smacking passing cars. Eventually, the federal officers march toward them, firing tear gas and flash grenades before hauling away at least a few people. This is the daily rhythm of Operation Metro Surge, US President Donald Trump's latest and biggest crackdown yet, with more than 2,000 officers taking part. The crackdown is barely noticeable in some areas, particularly in whiter, wealthier neighborhoods and suburbs, where convoys and tear gas are rare. Even in neighborhoods where masked immigration officers are common, they often move with ghostlike quickness, making arrests and disappearing before protesters can gather in force. “We don't use the word ‘invasion' lightly,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, told reporters this week, adding that his police force has just 600 officers. Those agents have an outsized presence in a small city. So as worry ripples through the region, children are skipping school or learning remotely, families are avoiding religious services and many businesses, especially in immigrant neighborhoods, have closed temporarily. Drive down Lake Street, an immigrant hub since the days when newcomers came to Minneapolis from Norway and Sweden, and the sidewalks now seem crowded only with activists standing watch, ready to blow warning whistles at the first sign of a convoy. At La Michoacana Purepecha, where customers can order ice cream, chocolate-covered bananas and pork rinds, the door is locked and staff let in people one at a time. Nearby, at Taqueria Los Ocampo, a sign in English and Spanish says the restaurant is temporarily closed because of “current conditions.” It has been nearly six years since George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer, but the scars from that killing remain raw. Floyd was killed just blocks from where an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old US citizen, during a Jan. 7 confrontation after she stopped to help neighbors during an enforcement operation. Federal officials say the officer fired in self-defense after Good “weaponized” her vehicle. He said he did not want to see the violent protests that shook Minneapolis after Floyd's death, but this city has a long history of activism and protests, and he had no doubt there would be more. “I think they'll see Minneapolis show our rage again,” he said. In the days since, there have been repeated confrontations between activists and immigration officers. Most amounted to little more than shouted insults and taunting, with destruction mostly limited to broken windows, graffiti and some badly damaged federal vehicles. The most serious force comes from immigration officers, who have broken car windows, pepper-sprayed protesters and warned observers not to follow them through the streets. Drivers can now stumble across intersections blocked by men in body armor and gas masks, with helicopters clattering overhead and the air filled with the shriek of protesters' whistles. In a state that prides itself on its decency, there's something particularly Minnesotan about the protests. Soon after Good was shot, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat and regular Trump target, repeatedly said he was angry but also urged people to find ways to help their communities. He and other leaders have pleaded with protesters to remain peaceful, warning that the White House was looking for a chance to crack down harder. When protests do become clashes, residents often spill from their homes, handing out bottled water so people can flush tear gas from their eyes. Residents stand watch at schools to warn immigrant parents if convoys approach while they are picking up their children. On Thursday, in the basement of a Lutheran church in Saint Paul, the group Open Market MN assembled food packs for more than a hundred families staying home. Sometimes, people do not even understand what has happened to them. Eventually, the officers sped up, hit his rear bumper and both cars stopped. Crowds began to gather and a clash soon broke out, ending with tear gas. Long after the officers were gone he had one final question: “Who's going to pay for my car?” Indonesia and Malaysia have become the first countries to block Grok, the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by Elon Musk's xAI, after authorities said it was being misused to generate sexually explicit and nonconsensual images. The moves reflect growing global concern over generative AI tools that can produce realistic images, sound and text, while existing safeguards fail to prevent their abuse. The Grok chatbot, which is accessed through Musk's social media platform X, has been criticized for generating manipulated images, including depictions of women in bikinis or sexually explicit poses, as well as images involving children. To Lam wants to combine party chief and state presidency roles, with the decision resting on the election of 200 new party delegates next week                                        Communist Party of Vietnam General Secretary To Lam is seeking to combine his party role with the state presidency, officials said, in a move that would align Vietnam's political structure more closely to China's, where President Xi Jinping (習近平) heads the party and state. Lam, 68, bade for both top positions at a party meeting last month, seeking initial party approval ahead of the congress, three people briefed by Philippine Coast Guard spokesman Jay Tarriela and an embassy official had been trading barbs since last week over issues concerning the disputed South China Sea. The crucial waterway, which Beijing claims historic rights to despite an international ruling that its assertion has no legal basis, has been the site of repeated clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels. Organizers said more than 1,000 events were planned across the US under the slogan “ICE, Out for Good” — referring to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is drawing growing opposition over its execution of Trump's effort at mass deportations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Minneapolis has seen tense demonstrations against the Trump administration's deployment of federal agents to the city for an immigration crackdown, raising questions about what these officers can do on the ground and how President Donald Trump can respond. Trump has also threatened to the extreme step of invoking the Insurrection Act to clamp down on the protests and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has suggested people may be asked to “validate their identity” in some cases. Here are some of the most common questions, answered. Tim Walz has openly rebuked the surge of federal activity in Minneapolis. Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy both invoked the Insurrection Act against the wishes of governors in order to facilitate school integration after the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling. On Friday, Trump said there's no reason to use the Insurrection Act “right now,” but that he'd invoke the law if he felt it were necessary. Read CNN's Zachary B. Wolf's analysis of the Insurrection Act here. Immigration agents can use deadly force against someone who poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury, according to a DHS policy. Historically, federal law enforcement agencies have spent weeks or even months conducting exhaustive investigations before deciding whether an agent's use of force was appropriate. But Trump administration officials have rushed to offer full-throated defenses of immigration agents after high-profile use of force, raising questions about whether mechanisms meant to hold law enforcement accountable for wrongdoing have been abandoned in Trump's second term, writes CNN's Josh Campbell. The administration has argued agents are immune to prosecution by state or local officials. And any federal prosecutions seem unlikely, Campbell writes, due to Trump's installation of political loyalists atop the Justice Department and FBI. While lamenting images he claimed to have seen showing protesters spitting on officers, Trump said in August, “I said, ‘You tell them, “You spit, and we hit,”' and they can hit real hard,” Trump said. A similar carte blanche signal is being sent to ICE officers and other federal agencies assisting in Trump's immigration crackdown, DOJ insiders have told CNN. Read more of Campbell's analysis on federal agents' powers here. Noem said Thursday that federal agents may also ask people around someone they're targeting to “validate their identity.” “If we are on a target and doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are and why they're there, and having them validate their identity,” Noem said. “The immigration officer needs to have some reasonable suspicion. You cannot just arbitrarily approach people and make them prove that they are in fact here legally.” Cori Alonso-Yoder, an associate professor at University of Maryland law school, told CNN federal agents can ask for proof of citizenship, but people can resist showing their documents under the Fifth Amendment. “ICE certainly can ask and then the question is, then, how does an individual in that circumstance respond,” Yoder, who is also the director of the law school's immigration clinic, said. Michele Goodwin, professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University,  told CNN the 10th Amendment established that states retain sovereign power to make local laws and govern within their borders, and the federal government cannot impose its will over a state, unless that authority has been granted by Congress or the Constitution. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said earlier this week that the state's lawsuit is aimed squarely at what he described as unlawful federal overreach, not at blocking immigration enforcement itself.

Wolf, Josh Campbell, Michael Williams, Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Chelsea Bailey, Danya Gainor, and Taylor Romine contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Saturday the United States will impose new tariffs on several European countries unless a deal is reached for the purchase of Greenland, escalating his long-running push for US control of the Arctic territory. Trump said Saturday he will impose a 10% tariff on “on any and all goods” from Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and other countries starting February 1, increasing to 25% on June 1, until an agreement is reached. “We have subsidized Denmark, and all of the Countries of the European Union, and others, for many years by not charging them Tariffs, or any other forms of remuneration,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. Trump argued that Greenland is central to US and global security and said Denmark's defenses were insufficient, warning that the nations deploying small numbers of military personnel to Greenland amounted to “a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet.” Meanwhile Saturday, protesters demonstrated in Greenland and Denmark against Trump's threats to take over the Arctic island, and demanded that its citizens should be allowed to determine its own future. A protest kicked off later in Greenland's capital of Nuuk. People waved banners including “Yankee go home,” and “Greenland is already great.” In Copenhagen many waved banners with slogans including “Hands off Greenland” alongside the territory's red and white flag, according to Reuters. In Greenland on Saturday, protesters were similarly defiant. Asked what her message to the US president was, one female protester in Nuuk, who didn't give her name, told CNN, “We are not for sale.” Another protester named Patricia said, “We have seen what he (Trump) does in Venezuela and Iran. A male protester, who didn't give his name, said, “We do not accept this kind of aggression,” referring to Trump's threats on Greenland. “My biggest fear is that the US military come here and try to take over our country. But I don't think it will happen.” Amid the escalating situation, a US delegation of bipartisan lawmakers were sent to Copenhagen to meet with leaders from Denmark and Greenland. In a press conference on Saturday, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who is leading the delegation, said the Trump administration's “tempo of statements” around Greenland's potential acquisition was not constructive. Senator Coons also expressed his respect to the indigenous people of Greenland, telling journalists that it was a “remote and difficult place to live, and that the population of Greenland has managed to carve out of an exceptionally difficult environment, a culture and an approach to living that is worthy of deep respect.” Reporting from Greenland's capital of Nook, CNN's International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson said the visit by the US lawmakers was intended to signal how much Denmark's military partnership with the US is appreciated. “The visit to that cemetery today to lay a wreath, really for them, will sort of encapsulate how much the United States has valued that partnership, valued the lives laid down by Denmark, by Danish troops,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yuliia Tymoshenko, head of the Batkivshchyna parliamentary faction, attends a court hearing at the High Anti-Corruption Court in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Jan. 16, 2026. It's hard to imagine Ukraine's political scene without Yulia Tymoshenko. A veteran politician, Tymoshenko has held a variety of government posts, serving as the country's prime minister twice, being defeated in a presidential runoff back in 2010, and leading the country's opposition at different times. On Jan. 14, Tymoshenko was charged with bribery — the third trial of her tumultuous 30-year political career. For her supporters, now few in numbers, Tymoshenko remains a democratic firebrand and a hero of the pro-Western 2004 Orange Revolution. "She's not the kind of figure you can judge in a linear way, or paint entirely in white or black tones," political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. "She is definitely one of the most prominent figures in Ukrainian politics. But over time, that gradually faded when people saw that she was playing the same games she used to accuse everyone else of playing." Success in business propelled her onto the political stage. Her meteoric rise to fame was driven by Pavlo Lazarenko, the country's prime minister from 1996 to 1997, who saw Tymoshenko as his protege. The party has been elected to every Ukrainian parliament since 2002. From 1999 to 2001, she was a deputy of then Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko and spearheaded a reform in the energy sector. She and her husband were arrested on charges of smuggling Russian gas in what was widely seen as a political reprisal by Kuchma. “If we didn't have Yulia, we would have seen Leonid (Kuchma) morph into (Belarusian dictator Aleksander) Lukashenko a long time ago,” Serhiy Taruta, a businessman, lawmaker from the Batkivshchyna party, and longtime friend of Tymoshenko, told the Kyiv Independent. Tymoshenko played a pivotal role in the 2004 Orange Revolution, which was sparked by voting fraud in favor of Kuchma-backed candidate Viktor Yanukovych during a presidential election. "If it hadn't been for her powerful role back then, in 2004, it's still unclear how everything would have ended," Fesenko said. Tymoshenko (and her protege Oleksandr Turchynov) held (Yushchenko's) election campaign together.” Following the Orange Revolution, Tymoshenko twice served as prime minister — in 2005 and from 2007 to 2010. During her time in office, she fell out with Yushchenko — a rift that became one of the biggest political stories of the late 2000s. Her government supported increasing social spending, confiscating assets privatized with violations and re-privatizing them, imposing price controls, and intervening in the markets to push prices down. Since then, Tymoshenko has developed a unique brand of populism targeting mostly the poor and elderly. Retired women have been her core support group ever since. Tymoshenko has opposed farmland sales and liberalization of utility tariffs. She has also attacked the pro-Western rule of law and free-market reforms, claiming that they restrict Ukraine's sovereignty through the influence of foreign experts on appointments to state jobs. "She was essentially the founding figure of Ukrainian populism," Fesenko said. "In fact, she was the grandmaster and genius of Ukrainian populism." Political analyst Oleksiy Kovzhun told the Kyiv Independent he had stopped working as a consultant for Tymoshenko in 2008 when he "realized that she was shifting from a progressive politician to a reactionary one" and bet on "impoverished older women." During her premiership, Tymoshenko met Russian President Vladimir Putin several times and enjoyed an apparently good relationship with the Kremlin, prompting her critics to claim that she was pro-Russian. "It's a well-known story where both sides try to deceive their opponent, to use them for their own benefit," Fesenko said. She ran in a presidential election but lost to her political archenemy, the pro-Russian politician Yanukovych, receiving 45.5% in the runoff. Under Yanukovych, several criminal cases were opened against Tymoshenko in what was widely seen as a political vendetta. In 2011, a court sentenced her to seven years in jail for allegedly abusing her power while signing the 2009 contract to buy natural gas from Russia. In 2013, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Tymoshenko's detention was arbitrary and unlawful and likely was politically motivated. Kovzhun said that, when she spoke to EuroMaidan protesters in a wheelchair after being released from jail, it was clear she had lost touch with the people. "These were people who smelled like smoke, who had stood for months on the Maidan under police batons, under bullets — they'd been scorched by fire," he said. "And then a lady shows up saying, 'I'll protect you from injustice.' That's when she lost her connection to the people." Fesenko argued that EuroMaidan supporters "saw Tymoshenko as an outsider." "They wanted a different, new kind of politics," he added. In other words, her star was on the decline." “We remember when the 2019 elections were held, and when Zelensky did not launch his campaign, if Zelensky had not run, she would definitely be president,” Taruta said. "At that point, there was a desire to cast aside everyone who had been part of the old politics." Kovzhun argued that Tymoshenko "was pushed to the political fringe." Her current support rate balances between four and six percent, depending on the poll. Both under Poroshenko and Zelensky, Tymoshenko and her party presented themselves as part of the opposition but often supported the administration's initiatives. The law was later overturned under public and Western pressure. But in recent weeks, Tymoshenko apparently decided to move against the incumbent administration. One possible explanation is that she wanted to provoke the creation of a new Cabinet and get government jobs for her party, according to Fesenko. Tymoshenko's actions were likely inspired by the weakening of Zelensky's grip on parliament amid a large-scale corruption investigation targeting his inner circle, which led to the resignation of President's Office Head Andriy Yermak in November, he added. "Since the 2000s, she has essentially always worked using other people's money," Fesenko said. The corruption case may damage or even bury (Tymoshenko's political career). Yulia may become toxic for sponsors, and she won't make it without money."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine needs to ramp up electricity imports as new Russian attacks leaves tens of thousands without power during the country's coldest winter of the full-scale invasion, President Volodymy Zelensky said following an emergency energy meeting on Jan. 17. Russian forces launched overnight attacks on Jan. 16-17 across Ukraine, hitting energy infrastructure, including substations, in Odesa and Kyiv oblasts, triggering emergency power outages, authorities reported. There are also reports of energy instability in Poltava, Sumy, Chernihiv, and Dnipro oblasts, Zelensky added. "We need to accelerate as much as possible the increase in electricity imports and the provision of additional equipment from partners. Ukraine can only meet 60% of its energy generation needs, Zelensky previously said on Jan. 16 . Ukraine has ramped up electricity imports, but it is limited by a maximum capability of 2.3 gigawatts. Prices are also sky-high, meaning cash-strapped Ukraine often imports less than that. Rolling blackouts are occurring across the country, even in Western regions, to balance the grid – typically 16 hours without power and eight hours with. Hours after the meeting, a heavy Russian strike seriously damaged critical infrastructure in Kharkiv and injured one person, the city's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, wrote on Telegram. Energy repair workers hope to connect both regions by the evening, Zaichenko said. Russian troops also hit gas infrastructure, damaging equipment used for extraction, Serhii Koretskyi, CEO of Ukraine's state-owned oil and gas giant, Naftogaz, wrote on Facebook. Over the last week alone, Russia struck six different gas facilities, he added. "Taking advantage of abnormal weather conditions, the enemy intensifies strikes on civilian infrastructure, trying to deprive us of heat, creating unbearable living conditions," he wrote. President Volodymyr Zelensky declared a state of emergency in Ukraine's energy sector earlier this week as citizens struggled through bitingly cold conditions without heating and power, with temperatures dropping to -20 Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit) at night. A task force, led by newly appointed Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal, has been set up in Kyiv to manage the crisis.Allies have stepped up support, with Germany sending a 60 million euro ($69.6 million) winter support package. Russians have been known to hunt energy workers in frontline regions, killing and injuring hundreds during the war.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So far, Claudia Sheinbaum has urged her country to play it cool. “I don't think that the U.S. is going to replicate those measures. But clearly, they will feel more confident in pushing crazy ideas.” Many of those would-be scenarios were itemized in interviews with Mexican economic leaders, industry representatives and government veterans this week. Most prominent are worries about Mr. Trump sending the U.S. military into Mexico to take on its drug cartels, which he has been openly threatening. It all seemingly points toward an anxiety level, around the neighbouring superpower's volatile behaviour, that is by now unpleasantly familiar to Canadians even if specific concerns are different. But even post-Venezuela, there remains a sanguineness to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's response that starkly contrasts with the more urgent, sometimes panicked reaction by Canadian politicians since Mr. Trump returned to the White House. It's a strategy of de-escalation with Mr. Trump behind which most Mexicans have fallen in line, and even commentators critical of other government policies give her credit for cool-headedness. But it is at some risk of fraying if she's seen to surrender sovereignty in return for peace, or if she fails to stop the U.S. President from exacting a further toll on an already troubled Mexican economy. And she has rarely gone as far as Prime Minister Mark Carney – let alone former PM Justin Trudeau – in publicly suggesting that the United States is no longer a reliable partner. Nor is there nearly as much messaging, from Ms. Sheinbaum or anyone else, about the need for Mexico to carve out its own economic path to reduce its U.S. dependence. There have been some efforts to foster greater self-reliance, highlighted by the revival of an old Made in Mexico branding campaign to promote Mexican consumption of domestic products, and some relatively quiet attempts at market diversification, including modernization of a trade agreement with Europe. Ms. Sheinbaum's populist predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, might have taken a fierier anti-U.S. stance. Despite leading the Morena party that Mr. López Obrador founded, and sharing its left-of-centre ideals, Ms. Sheinbaum is much more technocratic. It has long been even more economically dependent than Canada on the U.S., which accounts for over 80 per cent of its exports. It has fewer natural resources that are in global demand, despite some export growth potential around sectors such as agriculture and mining. Much of its trade revolves around low-cost manufacturing – that is, low-cost for the U.S. market, not relative to many other countries, including seemingly natural trade partners around Latin America. That helps explain, for instance, why analysts here see little prospect of Ms. Sheinbaum following Mr. Carney's lead by warming relations with China, after Mexico recently imposed new tariffs on China at Mr. Trump's behest. Not only do they point toward greater perceived danger for Mexico in antagonizing the U.S., they also see China as more of a manufacturing competitor than a reciprocal trade partner. But that history is a double-edged sword for Ms. Sheinbaum, due to heightened sovereignty sensitivities. Those exist most obviously around potential action to combat the drug cartels. Their brutal impact on the country, including effective control of entire states, is undeniable, and Ms. Sheinbaum has adopted a more aggressive approach to combatting them than did Mr. López Obrador. But even among people who believe action to date has been insufficient, a common view is that the U.S. military directly striking the cartels within Mexico would cross a red line, unless Ms. Sheinbaum were credibly able to present it as a joint effort she'd requested (and perhaps even then). Economist Valeria Moy thinks curbing trade with China to appease Mr. Trump goes too far. The sovereignty concerns are also frequently invoked around potential economic concessions. Valeria Moy, a free-market economist who heads the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, described herself in an interview as no fan of Chinese trade policies. But she expressed discomfort with trying to appease Mr. Trump by restricting Chinese imports or investment. There are various theories around what other possible sovereignty compromises Mr. Trump could demand as part of the looming trade-deal review, from U.S. access to Mexico's energy market to new rules of origin that could compromise Mexico's manufacturing. But there are also cautions about making further concessions before the CUSMA review even begins in earnest. As for what Ms. Sheinbaum might be able to get in return, even just by way of relief from punitive measures already taken by Mr. Trump, expectations are limited. Although Mexican officials are fond of pointing out that Mexico (like Canada) is currently subjected to fewer U.S. tariffs than most other countries, it's also (like Canada) suffering from unusually high 25-per-cent tariffs on specific sectors such as steel and automotive. Meeting at his office, Rogelio Arzate – who leads the association representing Mexico's significant truck-manufacturing industry – pointed to charts showing his members' production down about 35 per cent in 2025. Meanwhile, the uncertainty around CUSMA's future is making it difficult to attract domestic investment – including as part of Ms. Sheinbaum's signature economic strategy, Plan Mexico, which is aimed partly at attracting advanced and traditional manufacturing. Still, the prospect of CUSMA collapsing or being dramatically altered is treated by most voices here as a remote one, mostly because of pressure from the U.S. private sector to keep it in place. Adding a little to that confidence are improvements in Canada-Mexico relations. And Mexicans were rankled by suggestions, made particularly undiplomatically by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, that Canada should approach the U.S. separately and let Mexico fend for itself. Now, Mexico is set to receive its largest Canadian trade delegation in memory next month, led by senior cabinet minister Dominic LeBlanc. While that will be aimed at strengthening sectoral ties, ranging from financial services to auto parts to agriculture, Mexican observers drew encouragement from a visit this past fall by Mr. Carney, where he and Ms. Sheinbaum seemed to be on the same page about dealing with Mr. Trump. That united front has been maintained through subsequent meetings between the two leaders. Donald Trump shows little patience for those who say he's violating international law.

BERLIN, January 17. /TASS/. Former NATO Secretary General (in office from 2014 to 2024) Jens Stoltenberg has called on Western countries to "talk to Russia as a neighbor."

"We need to discuss ending the fighting in Ukraine with Russia just as we, the United States, and other countries are doing. <...> We need to talk to Russia as a neighbor," he said in an interview with Der Spiegel magazine.

A return to dialogue with Russia is necessary, among other things, for the discussion of arms control, Stoltenberg noted. "Even during the Cold War, we managed to limit nuclear weapons, but that architecture no longer exists," he said.</p>
