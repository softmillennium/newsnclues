                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘Supernatural' fans will soon witness a long-anticipated on-screen reunion as Jensen Ackles expressed enthusiasm over once again collaborating with former co-stars Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins in the concluding season of ‘The Boys'. In a recent interview with People, Ackles opened up about his enduring friendship with Padalecki and Collins, saying, “We see each other more often than you would think — honestly, at least once a month.” Reflecting on the recent experience of having both actors visit and work with him on the set, he shared, “It was weird. It was like inviting my friends over to somebody else's house for dinner. I was like, ‘Listen, guys, don't make me look bad. Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who portrayed the Winchester brothers' father in the earlier seasons of the CW series, made a memorable appearance as Joe Kessler — a hallucination tormenting Karl Urban's Billy Butcher. This week, Kripke marked the end of principal photography on The Boys' finale with a heartfelt message on social media. “It's bittersweet, but my primary feeling is gratitude,” he wrote. This reunion would not only serve as a nostalgic moment for long-time viewers of ‘Supernatural', but also a fitting culmination to Kripke's two most iconic genre-bending series. Ackles, who starred as Dean Winchester for 15 seasons alongside Padalecki's Sam Winchester in Eric Kripke's cult CW series ‘Supernatural' (2005–2020), joined ‘The Boys' in its third season as Soldier Boy. Since then, The Boys has continued to attract a growing audience, with Kripke, the showrunner, now preparing to bring the story to a close with its upcoming fifth season. As production wraps and anticipation builds for the fifth and final season of The Boys, fans will be watching closely for any official announcements confirming the reunion that genre television enthusiasts have long awaited.

THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY Kandiss Taylor, a congressional candidate from Georgia and supporter of President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, faced criticism for a social media post Saturday in which she shared conspiracy theories about the recent deadly flash floods along Texas's Guadalupe River. In a post on the social platform X, Taylor, who is currently campaigning for a House seat in Georgia, wrote: "FAKE WEATHER. She added: "Hurricane Helene left me powerless for 16 days & caused $57K in damage. If fake weather causes real tragedy, that's murder.

The congressional candidate's remarks denying climate change in light of the deadly flash floods in Texas were strongly criticized on social media.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Lakefront Psychic and Holistic Festival returns to the Walter F. Bruce VFW Post 1145 in St. Clair Shores July 11-13 and offers healing for mind, body and spirit. “This is considered to be a healing and fun event,” said organizer Laura Moody, president of Rock Your World Events. Many people spend some time sitting by the shore during the three-day festival enjoying food from one of the food trucks or just listening to music. There will be psychics, mediums, astrologers, tarot card readers, reiki healers, reflexologists and massage therapists. “The healing of the mind can come with the readings; you get an uplifted reading and you are feeling better about your life,” said Moody, who will be doing pet readings. “No matter where people are at, whatever they are working on, we have something for them.” “All of the materials are there and you can pick a crystal that speaks to you and walk out wearing a pendant that you have made,” said Moody. “It is a beautiful wrap and very sophisticated.” Music by headliner Nashville singer-songwriter Shanna in a Dress, Michigan musician Rob Crozier as well as local acoustic artists will fill the airwaves throughout the weekend. Tickets can also be purchased at the door, but the special pricing is only available online. The event will take place at the Walter F. Bruce VFW Post #1145, 28404 Jefferson Avenue, St. Clair Shores, Michigan, 48081 on Friday, July 11, from 3 p.m. – 9 p.m., Saturday, July 12, and Sunday, July 13, from 10 a.m. – 6 p.m. All individual readings and service sessions are offered at a reasonable cost in addition to general admission.</p>

During her long career as a UFO investigator and researcher, Kathleen Marden worked on multiple studies involving thousands of experiencers — parties who say they have seen or interacted with entities not known on earth. She spoke about surveys and analysis of “experiencers” at the International UFO Museum and Research Center on Friday. Marden is the niece of Betty and Barney Hill, a couple purported to have been abducted and examined by aliens in September 1961. Early on, she was convinced that what the Hills experienced were otherworldly encounters. This document, touted as a historical report on U.S. government studies about Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or UAP for short, was “an enormous lie.” “The military-industrial intelligence complex has exerted its power,” she said. Marden's examples include threats being targeted toward civilian investigators now “being worse than ever” and an uptick of misinformation delivered to the public through movies that use people's real names. Nearly 65 years have elapsed since the Hills were sought out by what appears to be extraterrestrial beings. What happened to them while traveling home to Portsmouth, New Hampshire after visiting Niagara Falls and Montreal is also the first widely reported information about a UFO abduction in the United States. As the trustee of her aunt Betty's estate, Marden has made it a priority to protect her aunt and uncle's reputations as honest people who were also involved in making their community better. Betty was a social worker and her husband worked for the post office. While the reporting was a substantial breech of their privacy, it prompted other witnesses to come forward with their accounts. Significant aspects of what Betty went through had been buried deep in her subconscious. In 1963, his emotional distress became “a life-threatening condition,” Marden explained before talking about her aunt and uncle's visits to a neuropsychiatrist who used hypnosis and therapy. The doctor hypnotized each of them separately because of how they were affected by the abduction, which included medical exams with some invasive procedures, Marden said. “Betty's dreams seemed to real to be dreams,” she said about her aunt's having five days of starting her sleeping thoughts with conscious recall, then recalling their car being surrounded by the abductors and “being walked to a craft” and ”taken to examining rooms.” And such findings were verified by other experts. Roswell-born actress Demi Moore and actor Colman Domingo — both previous Academy Award nominees — are starring in an upcoming film about the Hills titled ”Strange Arrivals.” This project is at a point in the movie-making process referred to as “development/pre-production.” “Their experience catapulted them to fame and celebrity, but underneath that notoriety simmered the truth of what really happened that night, which would test even the most epic of romances,” according to Variety, an entertainment industry publication. “Despite all the evidence you have seen, a new Hollywood movie is under production that will depict Betty as a delusional woman and Barney as the man who loves her and believes in her,” she said.
