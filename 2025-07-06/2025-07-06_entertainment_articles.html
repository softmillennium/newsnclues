The HBO series ran from 2012 to 2017.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Lena Dunham said she now understands why the lack of diversity on her hit HBO show Girls was “really disappointing to people.”


	The coming-of-age comedy-drama, which ran for six seasons from 2012 to 2017, was previously criticized for its characters not accurately representing New York City's diverse population. The creator and star defended the series in 2012, saying she's “half-Jew, half-WASP” and wanted to avoid “tokenism in casting.”




	More than a decade after Girls first premiered, Dunham recently reflected on the show, telling The Independent, “I think one of the profound issues around Girls was that there was so little real estate for women in television that if you had a show called Girls, which is such a monolithic name, it sounds like it's describing all the girls in all the places. And so if it's not reflecting a multitude of experiences, I understand how that would be really disappointing to people.”

Girls, which also starred Allison Williams, Jemima Kirke, Adam Driver, Zosia Mamet and Alex Karpovsky, followed the lives of a group of young women in their early twenties as they navigated life, love and careers in New York City.


	Dunham added that she appreciated “the conversation around Girls” and that it helped her make sure her new show Too Much, which sees her serving as producer, writer and director, featured different perspectives and experiences.


	“The thing I have really come to believe is that one of the most important things is not just diversity in front of the camera, but it's diversity behind the camera,” she explained. “As a producer, one of my goals is to bring a lot of different voices into a position where they can tell their story.”

	











Too Much, which stars Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, follows New York workaholic Jessica, who moves to London planning on being alone following a breakup, only to meet Felix, who causes her to reconsider finding love again. The show debuts on Netflix July 10.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Long established as an allegory for the immigrant experience, especially when viewed through the personal histories of Superman‘s comic book co-creators — second-generation Jewish immigrants Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster — DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn said his forthcoming film entry of Kal-El keeps in tune with the original 1938-created vision. “An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.” David Corenswet Shares 'Superman' Advice He Got From Henry Cavill & Tyler Hoechlin When asked how the blockbuster may be perceived in predominantly red versus blue states, especially amid prevailing anti-immigrant and refugee sentiment, Gunn responded, “Yes, it plays differently, but it's about human kindness and obviously there will be jerks out there who are just not kind and will take it as offensive just because it is about kindness. When he gets drawn into conflict at home and abroad, the Man of Steel — and his trusty flying dog Krypto — must contend with swiftly shifting public opinion as tech billionaire Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult) spots an opportunity to ascend. “Yes, it's about politics,” Gunn said of his take. Do you never kill no matter what — which is what Superman believes — or do you have some balance, as Lois believes? It's really about their relationship and the way different opinions on basic moral beliefs can tear two people apart.” While Gunn said the Warner Bros. Pictures movie aims to balance its message and fun family appeal, the ultimate goal is to tell a human story. “This Superman does seem to come at a particular time when people are feeling a loss of hope in other people's goodness,” the Guardians of the Galaxy director shared. He continued, “And I include myself in this. It is ad infinitum, millions of people having tantrums online. How are we supposed to get anywhere as a culture? We don't know what's real, and that is a really difficult place for the human brain to be. And, no, I don't make films to change the world, but if a few people could be just a bit nicer after this it would make me happy.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. If half of Americans interpret 2 hours of a superhero being kind to others as a political attack on them, America is finished. MAGA folk probably don't have the critical thinking skills to take away that thesis, Mr. Gunn. Magas are going to be the complainers which shows their true character.

It had been 27 years since he was last at this postcard perfect spa town two hours west of Prague, which is currently hosting the 59th edition of the underrated Central European film festival. Related Stories ‘Boys Go to Jupiter' Trailer: Coming-of-Age Animated Film Blends Lo-Fi Musical with Absurdist Humor Dakota Johnson Teases Directorial Debut: ‘I Just Won't Let Anybody Else Do It' At the July 5 ceremony, as a heartwarming and funny gesture, KVIFF's Executive Director Kryštof Mucha presented Douglas with an updated Crystal Globe trophy — the newly designed one that forms the festival's logo, since the festival's former President, the recently passed Jiří Bartoška, had always thought an award should be easy to hold. He apologized for coming a bit late to the press conference. It was his first time watching the film in Czechia, Forman's family was present in the audience, and he was so moved that he had to compose himself afterward. “I'm probably biased, but I think Miloš Forman is one of the best directors in the history of cinema,” said Zaentz, who has been touring with the restoration, having just presented it at Bologna, Italy, and at the Academy in Los Angeles. Many of the anecdotes exchanged were about the film's storied collaboration and of the decade-long, circuitous, and fortuitous path that led Forman to be hired by a then 29-year-old Michael Douglas. After Kirk bought it, he starred in a flop Broadway adaptation and failed to generate any studio interest in producing the film, even though he was at the height of his popularity in the '60s after the massive success of “Spartacus.” “My partner Saul Zaentz and I interviewed many directors, but we were frustrated by how close they kept their cards to their chests,” Michael Douglas said. “Most importantly,” Douglas said, “was the sense of humor that Miloš found without laughing at people but just laughing with them. So we invited Miloš out to my house in California. Saul and I said, ‘Thank god there's one person who is going to share with us the ideas.' Kirk was on the brink of giving up his rights when Michael told him, “Dad, please don't sell this. Interestingly, Douglas made no mention of how this handover tested the relationship between father and son for years to come, something that Kirk alluded to in an interview for the Guardian on his 100th birthday in 2017. Kirk had fully expected to be the film's lead, but Michael had to let him down saying that he was too old. Kirk had never heard of Jack Nicholson and said that the film would be a flop. (It actually went on to become the second highest-grossing film of 1975.) On another occasion, Michael said that he knew of his dad's version of the story — that Michael rejected him — and responded,  “Since when does the producer have casting control? That was the director.” In a 2005 HBO documentary “A Father, A Son: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” Kirk and Michael clashed again when Kirk said, “That's the picture when you destroyed me.” In the documentary, Michael laughs this off. At Karlovy Vary, Douglas was far more interested in sharing more fun stories, a couple of which involved Nicholson. “Cuckoo's Nest” shares the distinction with just two other films — “It Happened One Night” (1934) and “The Silence of the Lambs” (1991) — to have won all five of the top Oscars: Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and its applicable Adapted Screenplay category. Douglas recalled that Nicholson didn't want to be there since he had lost the two previous times he was nominated. As the ceremony began, “Cuckoo” proceeded to lose the first four categories it was nominated for (it had a total of nine nominations). After each loss, Nicholson, who was sitting in front of Douglas, kept saying, “I told you so.” But once “Cuckoo” won Adapted Screenplay, the rest was history. Upon hearing this, Douglas, who seemed to not have been in the know, said, “I just want to say, Paul, good luck on casting. It's not easy finding the Big Chief,” and proceeded to share a second hilarious Nicholson anecdote. When Saul Zaentz, Forman, Douglas, and Nicholson saw Sampson at the airport — nearly seven feet, wearing a cowboy hat and boots — Nicholson said (Douglas mimics a high-pitched voice), “Oh my god, it's the Chief, it's the Chief! Wait a minute, he doesn't have to talk!” [The character is deaf.] Later, on their flight in a tiny plane to a hospital in Eugene, Oregon, Douglas said he can't forget the image of Nicholson sitting on Sampson's lap, again going, “It's the Chief! Here, Zaentz made a somewhat surprising revelation. He shared that his late mother had suffered from depression for three decades and once tried to commit suicide. She was stopped before she could jump off a building and was taken to a hospital where the doctors recommended either lifelong institutionalization or electroconvulsive therapy. They agreed to it, and after a few treatments, his mother's depression was gone. Zaentz is now a proponent of this therapy, though it may feel outdated to many people today. Douglas — often outspoken — didn't dodge the question entirely and replied, “Let's just say that our president's name has been mentioned enough. Right now, our country is flirting with autocracy, as [are] some other democracies in this world. I hope what we're struggling with now [helps us remember] all the hard work that the Czechs did. Democracy is not to be taken for granted. The disappointing thing is that politics now seems to be for profit. We maintained an idealism in the U.S. which does not exist now. Zaentz, as gentle and calm as his demeanor can be, pulled no punches in sharing his viewpoint on this matter, and in fact did so more publicly when he came on stage before Douglas. “Recurring themes in Miloš' movies are individual freedom, and the struggle against oppression. ‘Cuckoo's Nest‘ is about rebellion,” Zaentz said. “It is one of the reasons why when I showed ‘Cuckoo's Nest' to the ‘Amadeus' crew in Prague in 1983, the next day I had a visit by the Czech secret police asking me, ‘Please don't show movies that are banned in Czechoslovakia.‘ It's ironic that 42 years later, ‘Cuckoo's Nest' is getting honored here on its 50th anniversary, and I'm afraid that Ken Kesey's brilliant book may be banned in the USA. Every couple sentences, the audience applauded and cheered. Mincing no words about the so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill“ that was just signed into law, he continued: “Yesterday, July 4th, the malignant, narcissist, want-to-be dictator that occupies the White House signed a bill that was passed by his cruel heartless followers to make the rich richer and take food and health care away from the people who need it. We shall overcome the totally corrupt, morally bankrupt, treasonous evil thing and his cronies. I'm certain that Miloš would agree with me that Trump is a stain on my country and his presidency would be looked upon as the greatest moral failure in the history of the U.S.” As they both pointed out in different ways, it was deeply ironic how forcefully their words landed in Czechia and other countries behind the Iron Curtain that underwent tragic trials with communism. Miloš Forman fled from the region to seek his voice in America. One suspects that Douglas and Zaentz feel the most at liberty to speak away from the borders and snake nests of their home country.

That makes it the 2nd biggest international box office opener of 2025, behind China's Ne Zha 2 and the biggest for Hollywood. JWR has already outgrossed How to Train Your Dragon, A Minecraft Movie and Lilo & Stitch in the market and is currently the No. 2 2025 studio title there, only behind Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning. In UK & Ireland JWR dominated at No.1 with a 52% share, and $16.6M. That's just off Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, in line with Dune: Part II, and above Gladiator II and M:I 8.

Notably, China dipped just 2% from last weekend, the best sophomore frame drop for a Hollywood movie of the year. Europe had a 32% drop, terrific given the strong opening and increased competition in the region, and Latin America held at -37% from opening weekend. Imax added $18.5M globally this frame, revving to over $60M worldwide and indexing at a mega 20.4% of the total.

Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Jurassic World: Rebirth will finale between $600 and $700 million worldwide. Wow, you “flop”sters are getting desperate. Oh no, it's not going to outgross AVATAR!! Here's a tip: Very few movies will. I hope Gareth doesn't get anymore movies. Insulted the audience with its nonsensical turns. Losses $100 million for a studio and gets right back to work…. F1 is one of the most expensive films ever made and its not going to come close to the 100 highest grossing films of all time. Shouldn't a 300 million budget film(not counting marketing) have to actually make money at the box office in order for you to proclaim it's a ‘hit'?😆 And that's why they are already working in a sequel. You left out marketing costs, plus they keep only about half the box office. If the production budget was really only 200m (doubtful) it would need 600m to break even. Apple is desperate for content which also accounts for the expensive show Invasion that keeps getting renewed even though nobody watches it. remember when a sequel to Brad's World War Z was gonna happen too then fell apart because it goy too expensive and the 1st didnt make enough money?😆 We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

After 20 years and 17 seasons, it's tough to imagine a world where “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” isn't on television, but there was a point where one member of its reliable ensemble — which consists of Charlie Day, Glenn Howerton, Rob McElhenney (aka Rob Mac), Kaitlin Olson, and Danny DeVito — almost bowed out. At the July 1 PaleyLive 20th anniversary panel (via People), Howerton revealed that prior to the start of Season 12, which broadcast on FXX in 2017, he told the creative team, “Look, I just don't want to wear out our welcome.” “I was worried that maybe we had sort of peaked or something, and I just was like, you know, we've been doing this for a long time. “I had not figured out yet how to stretch myself and be able to do other things that I wanted to do with my career outside of the show… I just hadn't figured out how to do that yet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At the Karlovy Vary film fest, the star also discusses measuring success in ways other than box office and how her TeaTime Pictures tells female-centric stories that are "provocative" and "different." Dakota Johnson (Fifty Shades of Grey, Black Mess, Suspiria) is likely to direct her first feature based on a script by an autistic actress she has acted with in a film, wants to continue telling female-centric stories through her TeaTime Pictures, avoid “toxic sets,” measure the success of movies in terms of viewer impact rather than box office and would love to play a psychopath and an action role, the actress said on Sunday. Asked by reporters during a press roundtable at the 59th edition of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (KVIFF) in the Czech Republic about whether she will move beyond acting and producing into directing, Johnson replied: “I think I will direct a feature, a very small one, hopefully soon. 'The Visitor': Vytautas Katkus' Feature Directorial Debut Is a Cinematic Meditation on Solitude “Usually, it's something that is either visually or emotionally provocative. And I don't mean that in a sexual way. I mean it in [the sense] that it provokes something that is different than what you see on TV right now or on streaming platforms. Producing has the benefit that she can surround herself with people who create a positive work experience. “I can't waste time on toxic sets anymore,” Johnson said. “Now, … being a producer and developing my own films, I can choose all the people.” Mentioning that Jurassic Park Rebirth has “slayed,” she said that, “the way I measure success is [in terms of] people who felt something or it meant something to them” — or people coming up to her in the street and telling her that they loved a film. Johnson made time for meeting the press before receiving the KVIFF President's Award on Saturday evening before a screening of her new film Materialists, which was directed by Celine Song and also stars Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans. The second film that Johnson presented at KVIFF is the Michael Angelo Covino-directed romantic comedy Splitsville, which she also produced under her TeaTime Pictures banner, launched in 2019 with her producing partner Ro Donnelly. Are there any types of characters she'd love to take on in the future? “There are roles that I dream of playing,” Johnson shared. Johnson also shared that “I love coming to film festivals, just because everyone loves movies so much, and it feels like a magical little bubble in a world full of chaos and pain.” She added: “I think art can really reach people, and so, … festivals in places like this make me feel inspired and hopeful.” She next stars in Amazon's Michael Showalter-directed romance thriller Verity, opposite Anne Hathaway and Josh Hartnett. “Dakota Johnson continues her family's multigenerational acting tradition, as represented by her grandmother Tippy Hedren and both of her parents, award-winning Hollywood stars Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson,” festival organizers had highlighted when they unveiled that she would visit the picturesque Czech spa town to receive the honor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For all of the Hallmarkies dreaming of being swept off their feet by a Hallmark Channel hunk in real life, actor Jack Wagner just provided a glimmer of hope that it's possible. In a social media video shared by Parade on July 2, 2025, The “When Calls The Heart” star, who just began filming his 13th season as Bill Avery on Hallmark Channel's hit series, revealed that his new wife, Michelle Wolf, considers herself one of countless “Hearties” — the nickname for the show's devoted fans. Wagner, who rose to fame in the 90s and 2000s on daytime soap operas including “The Bold & the Beautiful” and primetime dramas like “Melrose Place” before moving over to Hallmark, married Wolf on May 18, per Swooon. Among the things they have in common is their experience as professional musicians (he had hit songs in the 80s and she has written songs for and performed with numerous acts including N*Sync, Oleta Adams, BB King, and The Scorpions, according to her website. Another common bond they share is her love of “When Calls The Heart,” which he's starred in since it premiered in 2014. “She watches ‘When Calls The Heart,'” Wager, 65, told Parade. So I'm able to measure the show by watching Michelle, my wife now.” Sitting on his couch during the virtual interview, he pretended Wolf was sitting next to him and said, “Like, if I'm here watching and she's there, like, I can literally, like, I'll watch her and her reaction … ‘Ah! Because she's totally engaged as a normal person.” Wagner continued, “I can't watch shows as a normal person, right? You know, she watches as a normal person, okay?” “Maybe she'll record it and maybe we'll have some time to check out some of those episodes, and see how she reacts to that,” he told Parade. “But she's fully invested in ‘When Calls The Heart' in terms of how it moves people and touches people.” The news of Wagner's wedding came as a big surprise to fans when Wolf shared Instagram photos on May 31, as initially reported by EntertainmentNow. However, the two never announced publicly that they were engaged and have kept a low profile. Wagner returned to the Vancouver set of “When Calls The Heart” on July 1, posting a video from the airport in his Instagram Stories — as he does every summer — to thank Hearties for another season.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been a tumultuous month since “Doc” star and Hallmark Channel fan favorite Scott Wolf and his wife, former MTV “The Real World” star Kelley Wolf, announced that they were divorcing after 21 years of marriage. The Wolfs' divorce news took fans by surprise on June 10, 2025, but even more shocking was how quickly circumstances spiraled after their separate announcements, from Kelley's detainment by police to Scott being granted temporary custody of their kids. In a stunning twist, Kelley was detained by police on June 13 and placed under an involuntary hold at a local mental health hospital, she later confirmed. Then, on June 26, Today.com reported, a Utah judge granted Scott temporary sole custody of their kids — Jackson, 16, Miller, 12, and Lucy, 11. The judge also issued a temporary restraining order requiring that Kelley have no contact with Scott, their kids, or his brother Michael. A custody hearing was scheduled for July 1, per Us Weekly, to decide if Kelley could have supervised parent time and to discuss any financial matters. Kelley, who's worked for years as a certified life coach, has shared dozens of Instagram Stories and posts since her release from the hospital in late June, insisting that she is doing well. She initially stayed at a Park City resort while Scott traveled with their kids. Kelley wrote in multiple Instagram Stories that she was heading to European cities like Paris and Spain, but has spent the last week at a Utah cabin she posts from frequently, writing on June 29, “I am at a friends place now and eating her food and they are making me laugh.” In a couple of videos, she has shown videos or photos of people cooking for her or delivering food, but covered their faces because they asked not to be shown on camera. In a post on July 4, she wrote that “peace is a state of mind” and that she is “ready to begin again.” Yes, I have not changed my clothes in a few days.” On July 5, she excitedly posted several Instagram Stories about a friend named Angela Stem coming to visit her. She posted videos of herself shopping for groceries, writing that her heart was racing about her friend visiting, and later posted a photo of a charcuterie board on the deck. Kelley did not share any visuals of her friend, but the Arkansas native wrote in her Stories, “This is my Arkansas happiness…we love good food…good music. Quiet and good people…but we know how to do this… Let's go baby!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As its evocative title suggests, Black Sabbath and their many famous friends' stacked one-day show, here in Birmingham's Villa Park stadium, is intended to bring the band's story to a close back where it all began: their beloved hometown. The four-piece's legacy is intrinsically tied to the city in England's Midlands, whose endless sprawl of factories once produced what Black Sabbath came to define: heavy metal. The band made their final appearance on Saturday (July 5), under the banner of their original, “classic” lineup (Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Bill Ward), and boast a legacy that's almost impossible to quantify. They are the ground zero of heavy music, the big bang from which every metal subgenre and major act within it was birthed. As the great musicians here today continuously attest, across the course of their short and sweet sets (which all range from around 15 to 40 minutes in length): None of them would exist if it weren't for Sabbath and their music. Knowing this is Sabbath and Ozzy's final performances (the latter is managing a number of health issues) imbues it with an end of an era feel, although, as the show's multi-layered title might suggest: heavy metal will continue, but forever situated in the shadow of Black Sabbath's titanic contributions. Saturday was all about paying tribute to Black Sabbath and every single act on the bill performed at least one cover track. Openers Mastodon (who decried that the ensuing day will be the “greatest metal show of all time”) started the trend off in spectacular fashion with their rendition of “Supernaut.” Drummer Brann Dailor handled lead vocals and did a great job of matching the famous depths of power that Ozzy summons up on that Sabbath classic. The track's closing stretch was filled out by some additional on-stage percussion from members of Gojira and Tool, setting the tone for a day of covers, collaborations and white-hot metal performances. Their intense groove metal is as anthemic as it is razor-edged, and their mid-afternoon set drags Villa Park to new levels of intensity. Frontman Randy Blythe stalked the stage like a hungry hyena, inciting countless mosh pits and thanking the four Sabbath members for “inventing metal.” Ending with the strange sight of Blythe throwing both of his shoes into the crowd, Lamb of God's set is as short, head-spinning and satisfying as a quick pull on an illicit cigarette. One of the night's low-key heroes was Extreme guitarist Nuno Bettencourt who, between his shifts in various supergroup performances, spent more time onstage than any other musician. He joined Sleep Token drummer II and Yungblud for a rendition of Sabbath's “Changes,” an emotionally resonant ballad that feels tailor-made to be belted out by the expressive, charismatic Yungblud. Given the song's reflective, personal lyrics and the famous latter-day version featuring her and Ozzy's daughter Kelly, it's not hard to see why she – and the rest of us – would have found it a deeply poignant listen. The first of many legendary musician supergroup team-ups saw a rare two-track appearance by ex-Ozzy solo guitarist Jake E. Lee. The fondness wasn't extended to Disturbed frontman David Dramian, who was repeatedly booed whenever addressing the crowd during his brief stint onstage, before meekly departing. Google is your friend if you're wondering what might have elicited this reaction. Blink-182's Travis Barker, Tool's Danny Carey and Red Hot Chili Peppers' Chad Smith accompanied Tom Morello and others in a deconstructed version of Sabbath's “Symptom of the Universe,” taking it in turns to bust out fiery solos. Barker pulled out his usual tricks, but it was Smith and his tiny (compared to Carey's) kit which proved an intuitive delight to watch. Toward the end of the aforementioned second supergroup slot, a stellar lineup that includes Chad Smith, Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello and Aerosmith's Steven Tyler came together for Led Zeppelin's “Whole Lotta Love” and Aerosmith's “Walk This Way.” Tyler put in a fantastic performance, exuding presence and swagger that sparked widespread admiration. Later in the evening, Guns ‘N' Roses' Axl Rose also silenced his critics. His sometimes patchy live performances are well-documented, however he was in note-perfect, energetic form, particularly during a great cover of “Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,” far from the easiest vocal performance to emulate. Palpable excitement coursed through the air prior to Metallica's arrival. Opening with a solid, if un-spectacular cover of “Hole in the Sky,” their set immediately shifts into fifth gear with a one-two punch of “Creeping Death” and “For Whom the Bell Tolls.” The four-piece seem extremely up for it, bouncing around the stage, pulling out all the signature moves (from bassist Robert Trujillo's crab walking to drummer Lars Ulrich's gurning) and ripping through these iconic songs with such effortless élan you'd think they were in their practice room. He might not be able to stand, but his voice sounds immaculate, still possessing that signature volume and heft, which drives the energetic likes of “I Don't Know” and “Crazy Train.” Along with the frail and grateful Ozzy, another surprisingly moving sight is that of grizzled longtime guitarist Zakk Wylde stood by his side like a faithful old guard dog, or perhaps the devil's favorite minion. Black Sabbath's original lineup (Ozzy, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward) took to the stage together for the first time since 2005, for a half-hour set that opened with “War Pigs,” followed by “N.I.B.” and “Iron Man,” before closing with “Paranoid.” Interestingly, it's bassist Butler who put on the most eye-catching performance, reminding the world of his stature as one of rock's all-time great bass players. However, following Ozzy's request to “go f—ing crazy,” a plethora of mosh pits open throughout the crowd. It's short and sweet and absolutely monumental; a final explosion of metallic sound from four epochal musicians whose influence is impossible to quantify. This spectacular event did them justice and poignantly suggested that every end is merely another beginning.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Rahul Purini also spoke about the company's co-production strategy and what challenges remain for bringing anime to Western audiences: "That discovery piece is the biggest thing." Enter the buzzing showfloor at this year's Anime Expo, and you'll be met with the towering exhibitor presences of MAPPA, SEGA, Netflix, TOHO Animation, HULU, Viz Media, Aniplex, and more major players in a rapidly popularizing (and globalizing) anime industry. But even among the industry's recognizable players, Crunchyroll — and its series of showfloor experiences, merchandising, and photo-ops — calls back to the heyday of the convention circuit in a way few others do. The massive booth features a mass of large screens that deliver trailer takeovers and anime ambiance sequences that act as an environmental backdrop alongside an “Anime Forecast,” a series on interactive screens where fans can browse the company's catalog of upcoming titles. There's of course a merch store to pick up collectables, manga, vinyls, clothing, and more, but there's also the “trash to treasure” dumpster dive experience that introduces you to the characters and story of its upcoming graffiti-infused anime Gachiakuta as well as the Demon Slayer – Infinity Castle activation setting up the film trilogy's release. 'Frieren: Beyond Journey's End' Season 2 Teaser, 'The Apothecary Diaries' Sequel Revealed Inside, attendees move through an immersive set deco recreation of the Infinity Castle before interacting with a motion sensor experience that soars through the alternate dimension via the Crow, and a 3D photo-op that uses swords to simulate the breathing techniques (Water, Flame, Wind, Stone and Thunder) of key characters. This immersive activation helps make Crunchyroll's floor presence one of the Expo's biggest and most technologically advanced booths, and it's every bit a part of the company's strategy, says president Rahul Purini. Like the day-long pop-up convention hub Crunchyroll Stage and the Crunchyroll Lounge where onsite deals are made, the booth is a must-have — even if some of Crunchyroll's competitors have pulled back in certain corners of the convention circuit after launching their own events. “Fans love experiences, and this [booth], that's what we are creating here. It's not just some of our store. And we're trying to do that in places where the fans are already gathered,” he explains. Among them, exclusive footage of Studio KAI's dark fantasy Sentenced to Be a Hero, which sees criminals sentenced to heroism/service in a penal military unit waging war against a demon king's army, and the news that Studio Pierrot's Black Clover will return for an all-new season only on Crunchyroll, alongside a teaser trailer, key visual, a message from the manga's creator Yuki Tabata celebrating the anime's return and manga's 10th anniversary. Other news included a trailer for the newly announced anime adaptation of Daemons of the Shadow Realm based on a manga created by Hiromu Arakawa (Fullmetal Alchemist); confirmation of Re:ZERO – Starting Life in Another World season four streaming exclusively on Crunchyroll in 2026; and a two-minute first-look at the upcoming third season of Studio Bind's Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation; the October 2025 premiere of action comedy Tojima Wants to Be a Kamen Rider and January 2026 drop of romantic comedy You and I Are Polar Opposites. Classroom of the Elite fans will get a follow-up to season three, titled Classroom of the Elite 2nd Year, and the game Classroom of the Elite – Merge Puzzle Special Exam, playable for the first time outside of Japan via Crunchyroll's Game Vault, with Hiroyuki SAWANO LIVE [nZk]008 set to join Crunchyroll's library of over 100 full-length concerts later this summer. Ahead of Saturday's panel, The Hollywood Reporter spoke to Purini about the company's presence at the con and its current season, what he's most excited about in this moment of anime expansion, what challenges remain for those bringing the medium to western audiences, and key growth areas for the company. You've brought so much to the convention this weekend. What are you most excited about in terms of your slate? Our July season is among one of the biggest seasons that we've ever had. There are shows for every kind of anime fan. But the biggest anime show in Japan, Gachiakuta, which we are featuring here, is a show that I'm really excited about. It is from our partners at [Japanese publisher] Kodansha, and it is one of those shows where, if you watch the trailer, you're hooked. This kind of breadth and depth of show not only makes this season really, really compelling, it also talks to where we Crunchyroll are as a company. We have the single largest library of anime content anywhere. You worked at Funimation before heading up Crunchyroll, so you understand what the lift of making anime accessible to U.S. audiences was in those early days before places like Hulu and Netflix were also doing it. What was the biggest challenge then and what's the biggest challenge now in terms of bringing this content to audiences? Early on, the biggest challenge Crunchyroll and other companies that were serving this fan base solved was accessibility. There was anime fandom around the world, but it was hard to get your hands on it, even as your peers in Japan were watching and enjoying it [sooner]. We call it the simuldub, where now dubs are available one episode at a time within two to four weeks. But those were the initial challenges: accessibility, getting the shows from Japan and making them available to fans so they weren't waiting for 15 to 18 months for a DVD release or for some TV channel to pick up a show. The challenges now are somewhat similar, except it's a global audience. So making sure we have that diverse slate for the audience that's global, and making it accessible to them — that we're on all the devices that they want to watch, we have all the payments that they want to use to sign up for it, all the languages that they want to watch it in whether it's subtitled or dubbed, and making it available when they want to watch it. That discovery piece is the biggest thing that we are trying to solve because there's so much new content. How do we make fans aware of what's available, and serve as that connection. Platforms and streamers who more recently entered the anime market have increasingly found ways to blend it with Western animation or use American audience influences a little more in the visuals and storytelling. Can you talk about how your approach to your content slate is different, and how you tap into this medium that is outside the realm of Western storytelling to deliver for audiences? We believe anime is intrinsically connected back to Japan. It's an art form, and that's important to understand. This is not one genre that we serve the fan. So that focus and that clarity of what is authentically anime, and that relationship with partners, that relationship with the fans, and understanding why fans connect with anime, all of those things allow us to be able to serve those creators and fans in the best way. Crunchryoll is now many things, but first it was largely a content library. Many streamers started that way as well, and then expanded. How much do you want original content? First, we do not consider ourselves to be a streamer. We consider ourselves to be a media and entertainment company focused on serving the anime fan. The video content is a big part of that fandom but this is much bigger than that. We're not interested in being something for everyone. We want to be everything for someone. In terms of how we think about content, I go back to the amazing storytellers and partners in Japan. So we're doing co-productions, where we go to Japanese partners and help them fund shows by investing in them. We're actually part of the production committee that's making these shows. In addition to that, when we find stories around the world that we think are going to be great, we're now starting to take the stories back to the Japanese creators and are asking if they're interested in making anime from this story. Ghost of Tsushima  [based on the Sony PlayStation game] is a great example. We took this Korean [title based on the web novel-turned-webtoon], and went back to Japan and said we would love to make an anime. We will co-produce content with our Japanese partners to invest and bring shows. Anime has done some interesting things as it relates to theatrical releases, an area Hollywood has really been having a conversation about the last few years. The recent Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye experience, which put the first three episodes of season two together and screened them like a movie, is one example. Is there anything you think Hollywood can learn about the theatrical space from the anime industry in this current moment? They've been doing this for a long time. (Laughs) What we have found and learned is that fans like experiences. They want to be able to go sit in a dark theater with friends and family and experience their stories on a big screen and feel that sense of community. To them, it is great stories told in an amazing, creative way on a big screen. That is an interesting insight for us. About 18 months ago, we announced this initiative called Crunchyroll Game Vault. If you're a subscriber of Crunchyroll's higher tiers — mega or ultimate tier — you get access to games for free. That is an area where we are really excited because there's a big overlap between gamers and anime fans. And we recently announced that we're going to be bringing a digital manga app to our fans in the U.S. One of the things that fans ask us most is for access to manga, so we see a lot of opportunity to be able to serve fans through it. They want to show off their fandom, and we want to be able to bring these unique collector items — whether it is apparel, figures, home accessories — that they can buy. Another area that we see is theatrical. Demon Slayer is coming up, we are part of Sony Pictures and they've been bringing movies to the world for 100-plus years. You mentioned experiences and the exhibitor booth is one giant experience. Why is this such an important corner for Crunchyrull to occupy and are you thinking about ways to go bigger? We are constantly spending time with our fans. Yes, if the opportunity shows up the right way and we can create that authentic experience for fans, we will do that. At San Diego Comic-Con, we're going to have an anime music festival. But are we creating experiences that excite?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hurricanes, flooding, and mosquitoes pose a more likely threat to people incarcerated there than the alligators and snakes that President Donald Trump has “joked” about. Built in eight days, the facility consists of large tents, bunk beds, and chain link fences that form cages to hold about 3,000 people. The facility's inhospitable nature is a selling point for Republicans. “If people get out, there's not much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons,” Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said in a video promoting Alligator Alcatraz. The immigrants “are in a facility that is very inaccessible to lawyers, to family members, to oversight,” Renata Bozzetto, deputy director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, told The Washington Post in an article published Saturday. Being in an environmentally fragile ecosystem is a problem. Being constructed with temporary materials will be catastrophic in case of a hurricane.” For reference, top speeds of last year's Hurricane Milton reached 180 miles per hour. “You're probably wondering why I'm wearing a hoodie and a rain jacket, and that's because you can barely walk outside here because of the mosquitoes,” said NBC6's Hatzel Vela. Eskamani was one of five Democrats who were denied entry to the facility on Thursday. I've served in the Legislature for 13 years, and this has never happened,” state Sen. Shevrin Jones posted on X. “This is a blatant abuse of power and an attempt to conceal human rights violations from the public eye,” the lawmakers said in a joint statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Golden Globe winner recently said she's come to find diversity is “one of the most important things” in making television after she was criticized for the lack of diverse characters featured on Girls, which ran for six seasons from 2012 to 2017. “I think one of the profound issues around Girls was that there was so little real estate for women in television [then] that if you had a show called Girls, which is such a monolithic name, it sounds like it's describing all the girls in all the places,” she explained to The Independent. “And so if it's not reflecting a multitude of experiences, I understand how that would be really disappointing to people.” Also starring Allison Williams, Jemima Kirke and Zosia Mamet, the show was criticized for mostly starring white actors, many of whom have since been dubbed ‘nepo babies'. Dunham noted to The Independent that she “liked the conversation around Girls” as it was an important one to have, and she's since put what she's learned into practice, most recently on her Netflix series Too Much, premiering July 10 on the streamer. As a producer, one of my goals is to bring a lot of different voices into a position where they can tell their story,” added Dunham. Too Much stars Meg Stalter as New Yorker Jessica, who moves to London after a disastrous breakup and sparks a romance with musician Felix (Will Sharpe). Co-created by Dunham and husband Luis Felber, the Girls alum plays Jessica's older sister, who has retreated from public life after a messy divorce sent her moving back in with their mom.

However her show was like a Woody Allen movie where you live in NYC and there's no POC at all unless in a club, playing jazz or r&b music or a sports event or areas where they are imagined to belong. Dunham and her ilk were seen as invaders. To me, Girls was the same as the Walking Dead, but with rich white people instead of zombies. Something has always stayed with me about Girls.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Let the madness begin!” bellowed a mischievous Ozzy Osbourne from his bat-and-skull encrusted throne in front of a sold-out Villa Park in Birmingham, England. Boozers were decked with purple balloons and flags; murals were everywhere you looked; people donned Ozzy outfits, flooding the streets with battered T-shirts and denim jackets. Upon arrival, we were greeted by rumbles of distortion and a giant inflatable Ozzy who watched over his parish. The heavy metal royalty who graced the stage throughout the day were clearly struck by a similar sense of awe, that's perhaps because Black Sabbath have shaped and influenced each and every one of them, from openers Mastadon right through to thrash veterans Anthrax and Lamb of God. Even on this star-studded lineup though, there was always room for surprise as Yungblud joined the day's first supergroup set for a cover of “Changes.” Stomping onstage with spit and venom, he dedicated the band's most heartfelt song to the late Liverpool striker Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car crash. God bless Black Sabbath and God bless Ozzy Osbourne,” he declared before a heartfelt rendition that stopped the stadium in its tracks. The extravaganza rolled on with more legends including Alice in Chains, Gojira, Pantera, and Tool, who all seized their respective 30-minute sets.

For all the false farewells and goodbyes in his career, there was something so final about this one that added a crushing poignancy to the night. The great tragedy is that so often such legends die before celebrations on this level can take place, yet by some great miracle or divine intervention Ozzy Osbourne was here to take his final bow with his own tribe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world lost a talented and memorable '90s icon yesterday, leaving fans and co-stars alike in shock. Julian McMahon, best known for his iconic roles in “Charmed” and “Nip/Tuck,” tragically passed away at the age of 56. The sad news was shared by his family, specifically his wife, Kelly McMahon, revealing the actor passed due to a private battle with cancer. His deepest wish was to bring joy into as many lives as possible,” she revealed. McMahon's former co-stars, Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano, took to social media to mourn the loss of their beloved friend. Both talented powerhouses showcased the immense impact McMahon had on their lives. A post shared by Holly Combs (@thehmc) McMahon portrayed Cole Turner, a pivotal character in the series, from 2000 to 2005. The relationship with Combs' character was central to some of the show's most memorable and iconic storylines. This due to their strong characters crashing when it came to protecting Phoebe, who was the youngest Halliwell sister, and Cole's love interest. Combs described McMahon as “one of a kind,” reflecting on his zest for life and his unique ability to make others laugh. I hope you find our lady friend and dance in those rose petals.” The heartfelt message is likely a reference to Shannen Doherty, who played Prue Halliwell during the show's first three seasons. Doherty tragically passed away in 2024 after her battle with cancer. Combs' words resonated deeply with fans, suggesting a hopeful reunion between McMahon and Doherty in the afterlife. Fans reacted kindly to the post, sharing their love for the actress, all while sending their condolences. I saw an article where his wife said, He just wanted to bring joy to everyone. Well I will tell you that you brought me a lot of joy as Cole charmed. And I know I wasn't the only one resting in peace,” a fan said. 💔 I'm so sorry to hear this and I'm so sorry for the loss of your friend. I loved you all together on Charmed.” Milano, who portrayed Phoebe Halliwell, also shared her own tribute to the late actor. It quickly became a fan favorite and one of the show's most iconic love/hate storylines due to their character differences. Milano described McMahon's death as “too soon” and “too unfair,” remembering the strong connection they shared during filming. She also fondly remembered him as a “dear friend,” emphasizing that their bond extended far beyond their on-screen romance. “Julian was more than my TV husband. The kind who checks in,” she said. McMahon's death has left a void in the hearts of many, but his legacy as a talented actor continues to live on. Known for his unique roles, including in “Nip/Tuck,” where he portrayed the charming but troubled Dr. Christian Troy, the actor knew how to create a fan base in an instant. The actor also made a significant mark in film, most notably as Doctor Doom in the “Fantastic Four” movies. There, he starred alongside Chris Evans, Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd, and Michael Chiklis. The actor's charisma, talent, and larger-than-life personality made him a standout in every role. As tributes continue to pour in, it's clear that McMahon's impact on the entertainment industry and those who knew him personally will never be forgotten. Fans and colleagues alike now carry his vibrant spirit with them, and his memory will live on through the characters he brought to life.</p>
