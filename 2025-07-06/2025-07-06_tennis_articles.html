                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cam Norrie and Sonay Kartal are the only British hopes left standing at Wimbledon after an emotional exit for Emma Raducanu. Norrie will be back on his favourite stage, Court 1, to face qualifier Nicolas Jarry today. Meanwhile, Kartal makes her Centre Court debut against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. But Carlos Alcaraz came through another tricky tie against German player Jan-Lennard Struff on Friday to set up a clash with Andrey Rublev in the last-16, last up on Centre Court. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, fifth seed Taylor Fritz, and Queen's finalist Amanda Anisimova are also in action on day seven of Wimbledon. Follow all the latest Wimbledon news on Express Sport below... This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Wimbledon chiefs have conducted an investigation into a controversial incident during Sonay Kartal's defeat to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova which involved the new Electronic Line Calling (ELC) system. A spokesperson for the All England Club has confirmed that apologies have been issued to Kartal and Pavlyuchenkova, and that the ELC system was not functioning correctly for only one game during their match because it had accidentally been deactivated. "In that time there were three calls not picked up by live ELC on the affected part of the court. Two of these were called by the Chair Umpire, who was not made aware that the system had been deactivated. It was determined that the point should be replayed. In this instance there was a human error and as a consequence we have fully reviewed our processes and made the appropriate changes." Carlos Alcaraz will face Cameron Norrie in the quarter-finals. Amanda Anisimova has taken the first set against Linda Noskova 6-2 on Court 1. We've reached a crucial point in Carlos Alcaraz's clash with Andrey Rublev. Injured Wimbledon star Jordan Thompson has admitted he 'feels like a p***y' for retiring from his match against Taylor Fritz on Sunday. And he is now '95 per cent sure' that he will not be in any fit state to compete in the next round of the men's doubles with Pierre-Hugues Herbert. The 31-year-old has been grappling with a back issue throughout the tournament, and at 6-1 3-0 down it proved too much to bear as he conceded defeat to Fritz after only 41 minutes. As Thompson disappeared back to the locker rooms, Fritz told the crowd in his on-court interview: "Jordan's been battling out here, playing five-setters, I respect him for coming out, he was valiant. But the Aussie was hard on himself during his post-match media duties, saying: "Honestly, I feel like a bit of a p***y pulling out. Carlos Alcaraz was in trouble when he dropped a tight first set 7-6(5) to Andrey Rublev on Centre Court. Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry got heated with Cameron Norrie as they shook hands after their five-set battle. 3 then told the Court 1 crowd: "He said I was a little bit vocal and I think that's my energy. I was pulling from my team and then I just said 'man, you competed so well and hung in there so well and it was an amazing competitive match'." 1 Aryna Sabalenka found herself playing against the crowd on Friday night when she beat Emma Raducanu in front of a packed Centre Court. But British tennis fans quickly fell in love with the three-time Major winner, and she felt the support during her straight-set win over Elise Mertens on Sunday. It was so amazing playing and feeling the support. I didn't have to pretend that they were cheering for me because they were really cheering for me. "I mean, what can be better than that? I really hope that it can stay the same all the way, and they going to help me energy-wise to stay strong and to face all of the challenges." There was frostiness between Cameron Norrie and Nicolas Jarry immediately after their match on Court 1. It took five sets of hard graft, but Cameron Norrie is into the Wimbledon quarter-finals for the second time in his career. After Sonay Kartal's defeat earlier on, Norrie is the last Brit standing in the men's or women's draw. He went tow sets up against big-serving giant Nicolas Jarry before losing tiebreaks in sets three and four. His reward: a mouth-watering showdown with Carlos Alcaraz or Andrey Rublev. Could we be in for a shock here on Centre Court? Andrey Ruvlev takes the first set tiebreak 7-5 against Carlos Alcaraz. Never mind... Carlos Alcaraz broke back three games later after a flurry of errors from Andrey Rublev and the Spaniard has now served to level the score at 4-4. Two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz is on Centre Court for his fourth-round clash with Andrey Rublev. 2 has just been broken to love, and Rublev leads 3-1 early doors. Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova was fuming with the umpire for refusing to overrule the electronic line call during her win over Sonay Kartal. "I think it's also difficult for him. He probably was scared to take such a big decision," Pavlyuchenkova said. That's why they're there for sitting on the chair. That's why we have a chair umpire. Otherwise, I think soon let's just play without them, right, and then we're going to have everything automatic. Like during COVID, we didn't have ballboys. It just becomes a little bit weird and, like, robot sort of orientated." Nicolas Jarry has just forced a fifth and final set against Cameron Norrie on Court 1. Now, she's ready to relax before getting back on the hard courts. Yeah, I think I'll take a little rest, maybe a week or two off, just recharge, and get ready for the American swing." 1 Aryna Sabalenka is through to the quarter-final after beating friend and former doubles partner Elise Mertens 6-4 7-6(4). Afterwards, she told the Centre Court crowd it was difficult to play against Mertens. “It's tough to play against someone you know quite close and she's a great player great person and it's tricky facing her,” Sabalenka explained. “Especially, I know how smart she is and I know that she's going to fight until the very end and she will be trying to find something and she really challenges me today, so it's tricky and tough, I'm really happy with the win.” Nicolas Jarry has served an incredible 37 aces so far in this match. Jarry leds 3-2 in the fourth, but is 2-1 down on sets. Sonay Kartal has spoken out after she and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova replayed a crucial point at 4-4 on the Russian's serve in the first set when the electronic line-calling system glitched. Kartal went on to break and Pavlyuchenkova accused the official of "stealing" the game from her, though she stormed back to win 7-6(3) 6-4. Kartal has now said: "That situation is a rarity. The umpire is trying his best in that situation. It looked for all the world like Cameron Norrie would clinch the match there but Nicolas Jarry somehow stays alive. You could have cut the tension with a knife inside Court 1 as the two players contested a gripping tiebreak. Norrie spurned a match point and Jarry fluffed his first set point before converting at the second time of asking. Nicolas Jarry accused Cameron Norrie of disturbing him in an angry rant after the second set. It's not a nervous tick," Jarry fumed. "You think there's nothing I can do so I just have to suck it up, because he does it always. No matter what happens from here, Cameron Norrie will go down as the last Brit standing in the men's or women's draw from this year's Championships. Sonay Kartal lost her battle with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova earlier on, which means Norrie is the host nation's last remaining hope of having a quarter-finalist. He's two sets up and in the driving seat. Cameron Norrie won the first set 6-3 against Nicolas Jarry, and has now taken a second-set tie-break 7-4! Britain's last hope is on course for the quarter-finals. Sonay Kartal's dream Wimbledon run is over. 51 reached the second week of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in her career and made her Centre Court debut today to face Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. 11 and 2021 French Open finalist has shown that experience matters. Kartal served for the first set but Pavlyuchenkova wins 7-6(3) 6-4 in just over two hours. It's still been a great run, and she will become the new British No. A carbon copy.Lleyton Hewitt's 16-year-old son Cruz gets his first win at Wimbledon in the boys' draw! There was a huge cheer on Centre Court as Sonay Kartal survived a tough service game to stay hot on Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova's heels. From 40-15 up, Kartal was taken to two deuces but she held for 3-4. But Kartal is now serving to stay in the match down 3-5. A mountain to climb here for Sonay Kartal. 3 was broken in the fifth game of this set, and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova has just held for a 4-2 lead. Kartal's intensity is dropping after coming out on the losing end of a tight first set and the errors are coming. There are still promising signs from Kartal though, she sent a winner past her opponent before losing the game. Cameron Norrie has won the first set 6-3 against Nicolas Jarry on Court 1. It had all gone a bit limp here inside Centre Court. Almost all of the sporting stars in the Royal Box vacated their seats to take a break after that nail-biting 77-minute first set, won by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. But Sonay Kartal won't go down without a fight - she's just broken again and the fans are back to whistling and cheering. Mimi Xu rallied to win her first-round juniors match less than a week after making her Grand Slam main draw debut as a wildcard. The Welsh 17-year-old got a free pass into the women's singles draw here and came up against countrywoman Emma Raducanu on Court 1, losing 6-3 6-3. Pavlyuchenkova went 3-0 up after taking two mini-breaks but Kartal got one back. They changed ends with the former French Open finalist leading 4-2, and she gave herself three set points at 6-3. Work to do for the Brit in her first round-of-16 appearance at a Slam. Sonay Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova have already been going for 70 minutes. And this set is going to a tiebreak. It's been madness so far - there was an electronic line calling glitch, and then Kartal was broken serving for the set. Plenty of drama under the roof here on Centre Court. But play has resumed on the outside courts following an earlier thunderstorm. Cameron Norrie vs Nicolas Jarry is also underway on Court 1. Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova accused chair umpire Nico Helwerth of “taking the game away from her” at 4-4. The Russian had game point when Kartal appeared to send the ball wide but a call never came. Because she is local, they can say whatever. You took the game away from me,” Pavlyuchenkova claimed. 11 has broken back and we're level at 5-5. Sonay Kartal survived a marathon service game at 3-4 and she's now broken again after a nightmare error with the electronic line-calling system. Centre Court has erupted as the British No. 3 takes a 5-4 lead - but the game was almost over. Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova had a game point 4-4 and Kartal hit a ball that looked out but no automatic call came. Kartal was able to keep herself in the game and then broke to serve for the set. The first men's quarter-final is now set in stone, and Karen Khachanov will fight Taylor Fritz for a place in the semis. Both men have had to contend with two five-setters en route to the last eight, but Fritz may go in slightly fresher after Jordan Thompson retired through injury during the second set of their fourth-round showdown today. Khachanov, though, only needed three sets to beat Kamil Majchrzak. All in all it promises be a tasty meeting between the American fifth seed (Fritz) and the Russian 17th seed (Khachanov). Their match has been pencilled in for Tuesday. Even Sonay Kartal is smiling at that one! The crowd erupted as she landed a volley winner perfectly on the line to take a 0-30 lead on Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova's serve. And she's just broken, reeling off three games in a row to lead 3-2 from 0-2 down. It's all over on Court 1 as Jordan Thompson has retired from his match against Taylor Fritz. The Aussie came into the tournament nursing a back injury but it's believed to be a right thigh injury which has ruled him out of carrying on here. Fritz was comfortably ahead 6-1 3-0 when Thompson opted to call it a day after leaving the court for treatment earlier in the contest. Having booked his spot in the quarter-finals, Fritz said: "It's obviously not the way I wanted to go through. I was excited to play some good tennis. "He has been battling this week and his body is not right. It doesn't take a genius to work this out if you've read the earlier updates, but all play on the outside courts is suspended. Sonay Kartal has just broken back to love! In her first-ever service game on Centre Court, the Brit struggled to land her first serves and made too many costly mistakes. Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova took a 2-0 lead with a winner, but the fans here are trying to get behind the British No. Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova has just held serve in the first game on Centre Court. It's Sonay Kartal's turn to serve now, and the 15,000 fans inside Centre Court give her a huge cheer as she wins the first point on her serve. Jaume Munar was livid after a ball kid inadvertently interfered with a point during his third-round Wimbledon defeat. During one point, with Cilic serving to go 4-2 up in the fourth set, Munar scrambled to collect a shot out wide and made contact with a ball kid just before attempting a lob which landed out. Immediately afterwards, Munar angrily approached the chair umpire and asked for something to do be done. "He [the ball kid] cannot move?" After the umpire informed him that nothing could be done so long as he was in his assigned position, Munar carried on: "So if I'm running and I hit him, I hit him and that's it? I just destroy him and that's it? Yasmin heard that big boom from Centre Court, while here in the media centre we thought it was an earthquake! It really was something else, with people taking their headphones off in shock. Fans are cowering under every little bit of shelter as the rain buckets it down. There was a huge boom of thunder the moment she came out. She's also got large strapping on her right knee - which she also had in practice this morning. Kartal had a small bit of tape under the knee in doubles yesterday but this is a lot more prominent. There's a loud buzz under the roof as Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova warm up. Though there has just been a huge clap of thunder outside... Retired players return to Wimbledon to play in invitational men's, women's and mixed doubles events - and two-time men's singles champion Andy Murray would have had the option of signing up this year, but his name is nowhere to be seen. Other Brits, including Johanna Konta, Laura Robson, and Greg Rusedski had entered. Sonay Kartal is now just 30 minutes away from her Centre Court debut. The Brit is set to make her Centre Court debut in an hour when she faces Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for a place in the quarter-finals. We took a look at all 14 pieces of ink that Kartal currently has tattooed on her body. Cruz Hewitt, son of 2002 Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt, won his first ever match at the All England Club on Sunday morning. Hewitt started playing on the Challenger tour last August as he looks to follow in his dad's footsteps. Iga Swiatek has again been put on the spot over admitting to taking towels home with her from Wimbledon. After beating Danielle Collins on Saturday, she told the Tennis Channel: "Honestly, I take towels from everywhere, people just don't notice that,” she pleaded. Dan Evans has warned Sonay Kartal that she will face tougher challenge than anybody is expecting this afternoon. It is widely conceived that the Brit has a favourable draw and both should progress to the quarter-finals. "Looking ahead to Sunday, I was pretty bullish about Sonay and Cam's chances in my last column before the tournament and they have backed me up," Evans said. Pavlyuchenkova's been playing good on the grass and is a former Grand Slam finalist. "It's a tough match but Sonay has done great so far. It's a really special relationship she has with her coach Ben Reeves." 10 seed Ben Shelton is back into the second week here after beating lucky loser Marton Fucsovics on Saturday evening. After reaching the fourth round, the American was asked which players had a good tennis IQ, and he had to throw 20-time Major winner Roger Federer in there. "I've talked to Roger a few times just about the game. What kind of stuck out to me is how simple he put it, how simple he thought about things. Then the way that he was able to, like, simplify the game, dumb it down, not make it more complicated than it has to be, I thought was really impressive." The 1994 Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez believes the time is right for her own charge, teenage star Mirra Andreeva to win at Wimbledon. Asked about her favourite for the title with her host of seeds already out, the Spaniard told Boyle Sports: “In the women's draw, I have to go with Mirra. If Mirra doesn't win, I have to go with Aryna Sabalenka.“In the men's draw, I'll go with Carlos Alcaraz.” Andreeva - who is coached by Martinez - plays Emma Navarro in the last-16 on Monday. The Met Office is predicting patchy periods of rain right up until 6pm today, with the heaviest showers due between 1pm and 3pm. Men's title odds: Carlos Alcaraz 7/5; Jannik Sinner 6/4; Novak Djokovic 22/5; Taylor Fritz 17/1; Alex De Minaur 45/1; Ben Shelton 66/1; Marin Cilic 80/1; Cameron Norrie 150/1. Wimbledon star Ben Shelton was forced to defend his sister after she was jeered by the crowd on Court No.1 on Saturday. Ben Shelton after his win at Wimbledon \u201cMy sister\u2019s here. But she has work back in the US starting Monday. Jelena Ostapenko bizarrely lifted her skirt in a row with the umpire on Court No.1 yesterday. Ostapenko partnered Hsieh Su-wei for their second-round match against Marta Kostyuk and Elena-Gabriela Ruse, winning 5-7 6-2 6-2. In the warm-up though, official Jamie Crowson appeared to enquire about her clothing, and she angrily threw her hands up and lifted her skirt to reveal green undershorts. Fellow Serbian Miomir Kecmanovic said after his straight sets defeat: "It was insane, it was difficult to win points even when serving well. "One wonders what to do on the court when Novak plays at that level. I came into the match without fear and didn't put pressure on myself, but his level was very high. After beating Danielle Collins yesterday, eighth seed Iga Swiatek claimed a diet of pasta and strawberries was fuelling her during Wimbledon. She told a bemused Centre Court crowd: "I know, I know[it sounds strange, but you should try it, guys. "Why is it such a big thing? I think, in summer, kids are eating it a lot. We have great strawberries in Poland, as well." A peak TV audience of five million people watched Aryna Sabalenka beat Emma Raducanu at Wimbledon on Friday night. Raducanu's Centre Court appearance attracted the third-highest peak for a non-final match in four years. Only her own fourth-round match with Lulu Sun last year, and Andy Murray v John Isner in 2022, ebttered it. Alex Kay-Jelski, director of BBC Sport, said: "The Sabalenka v Raducanu match was one of those special moments that brought audiences to BBC Sport in their millions." So our two remaining British hopes are in action today. In the women's draw, Sonay Kartal is first on Centre Court against. Later on Court No.1, Cameron Norrie plays Frenchman Nicolas Jarry. Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz, and Aryna Sabalenka are also in action. But then a few days later, I beat him,” said Alcaraz when quizzed about losing to Murray in a pre-tournament match. I love playing golf on my days off. “I will try to set up a golf round again, nine holes, and we will see who wins. And Murray has now tweeted to suggest the Brit leads their head-to-head 2-1... Maybe ask him what happened after the next match ? Mirra Andreeva vs Emma Navarro is a very fun one. Tomorrow we've got the final British women - Kartal - vs Pavlyuchenkova first up on Centre Court. Court 2 sees Sierra face Siegemund in the second match. The ladies' singles Round of 16 is set \ud83d\udd12#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/SmV51TD5su Here's how we're lined up tomorrow and Monday in the men's draw. Tomorrow we've got Rublev vs Alcaraz last on Centre Court, Fritz vs Thompson first on Court 1 followed by Jarry vs Norrie - the last British man left at Wimbledon. Khachanov vs Majchrzak is also first on Court 2. Novak Djokovic has spoken out on THAT point in his win over Miomir Kecmanovic. "It was kind of like an ecstasy, to be honest, in that moment," he explained. It came at a really important moment, as well. Then just that diving backhand volley down the line passing shot. "Can't wait to see the highlight (smiling). Obviously I'm not diving as much on the courts. Obviously the only surface where you would dive is grass. "But I'm not used to it as much. So these kind of unique, rare moments are really something you cherish. "Of course, if you win a point like this in important moment is even better." Stojsavljevic, 16, made her main draw debut in the women's singles event earlier this week as a wildcard but lost to 31st seed Ashlyn Krueger in round one. She returned to the juniors but was stunned by Mia Pohankova. Stojsavljevic served for the first set but lost 7-6(4) 6-1. That has moved him ahead of Andre Agassi in the all-time men's list. Defending champion Barbora Krejcikova lost to 10th seed Emma Navarro in the third round on Saturday. Krejcikova has now said: "All I can say that the first half of the match I was definitely enjoying myself on the court and I was feeling quite well. But then suddenly out of nowhere I just lost all my energy and I couldn't really gain it back. "I mean, Emma was just fitter than me. But I wasn't really feeling better, I was actually feeling worse and worse with the time, yeah, with the time on court. The seven-time champion here made a statement as he breezed past countryman Miomir Kecmanovic 6-3 6-0 6-4, then celebrated by pumping his fists in multiple directions, as he did in the last two rounds. 6 seed then revealed that the unusual gesture was an inside joke with his two kids, letting Tara take centre stage from his box to demonstrate their special dance, which was broadcast on the big screens inside Centre Court. Novak Djokovic gave a classy statement after recording his 100th Wimbledon win, becoming only the third player to reach that landmark after Roger Federer and Martina Navratilova. The victory came against Miomir Kecmanovic on Saturday, and he made light of his fellow Serbian with a 6-3 6-0 6-4 scoreline. It has given me incredible things in life that I can experience. "I try not to take anything for granted, particularly at this age. I'm still going strong, still trying to compete with the young players and do some slides and some splits on the court and push myself to the limit." Iga Swiatek caused a stir earlier today on Centre Court when she revealed that she eats pasta with strawberries. And when she was quizzed about it after the match, the eigth seed claimed Poland had better strawberries than England, and then joked that she could get banned for the controversial comment. Because we have better climate for strawberries, right? Now Wimbledon is probably going to ban me from answering these questions,” she smiled. Emma Raducanu said the first thing she did after losing to Aryna Sabalenka on Friday was eat a KitKat in the locker room. 1 by a break in both sets but just came up short. Last night, she fought back tears in her post-match press conference and said it was tough to see the positives. But Raducanu has now slept on it and, on Instagram, she wrote: "Many feelings to compute but that was a mega night to have been part of. Thank you for the thrilling energy and atmosphere. I'm sure we gonna play big matches in the future," she commented. Novak Djokovic takes the second set to love. He leads 6-3, 6-0 and it looks like a formality from here. Hannah Klugman made her Grand Slam main draw debut here earlier week as a wildcard but lost her opening match to 29th seed Leylah Fernandez. Novak Djokovic has turned it up a notch in this second set. Momentum is fully with Novak Djokovic now. 3 Grigor Dimitrov - who reached the semi-final here 11 years ago - is through to the second week to face top seed Jannik Sinner. Dimitrov has been forced to retire injured from the last four Grand Slam tournaments, so his focus is on his own fitness, and he's not bothered about a showdown with the world No. The 19th seed said: “This particular match for me, with all due respect, I don't rate it as a ‘wow' match. It's just another day for me to perform, you know? “As I said, it's been difficult six, seven months for me. That match has meaning for myself more so than anything else.” If the roof was closed on Centre Court it wouldn't be attached no more! He has just won the point of the tournament, there is no doubt about it, diving to his left to hit a winner after a 14-shot rally where both players were drawn into the net. And the following point he wins to break for a 5-3 lead. Completely accidental as he tried to return a powerful Miomir Kecmanovic shot, but Novak Djokovic drew "ooo"s from the crowd as he sent the ball into the umpire's chair. But Miomir Kecmanovic has held his own and is now on serve, trailing 4-3. Belinda Bencic had to miss Wimbledon last year, for good reason. After returning to lower-level ITF events at the end of last year, Bencic has already picked up a WTA Tour title in 2025 and she's now into the second week of Wimbledon. She said: "I think I have a great support of my husband and all my family to be able to do what I love still and to have some great years ahead of me. So far everything is going really good. Sometimes I feel even more relaxed with a different perspective, you know, playing on the tournaments, maybe being more grateful that I'm able to play and to have these beautiful moments together." Iga Swiatek has raised a few eyebrows by revealing her favourite meal after beating Danielle Collins. The Pole called out her team for eating 'cheat meals' this week while she has to stick to a strict diet. When asked what was in store for her this evening, she said: "I ate it as a kid, it's pasta with strawberries. Pasta, strawberries and a little bit of yoghurt. Novak Djokovic and Miomir Kecmanovic have made their way onto Centre Court for the third and final match of the day here. The 24-time Grand Slam champion has a 3-0 head-to-head record over his fellow Serb. But after seeing Jannik Sinner blow away his opponent earlier today, can he make a similar statement? No.10 seed Emma Navarro has explained how difficult it was to continue playing while Barbora Krejicova was crying on the other side of the net. "It was really tough out here today. I know she was dealing with some injuries at times," Navarro said. "It's really not easy (playing when Krejcikova was crying). Part of you is telling yourself to put a bunch of balls in the court and that's all you have to do. "That's not good enough and then you trick yourself into taking too much off the ball and not playing the way you want to play. Barbora Krejicova broke down in tears on court towards the end of her third set against Emma Navarro. In the end it's an easy win for Iga Swiatek as the eighth seed breezes into round four of Wimbledon. She had Danielle Collins' number from start to finish and only needed 75 minutes to come away with a 6-2 6-3 victory. The BBC have announced that Emma Raducanu's brave defeat to Aryna Sabalenka on Friday night drew a peak audiance of five million viewers. Raducanu's fourth-round loss to Lulu Sun last year surpassed that mark, as did Andy Murray's four-set defeat to John Isner here in the second round in 2022. Alex Kay-Jelski, Director of BBC Sport, said: "Wimbledon has the ability to mesmerise the nation, and the Sabalenka vs Raducanu match was one of those special moments that brought audiences to BBC Sport in their millions. "We're proud to make these iconic and unforgettable sporting moments available to everyone free-to-air across TV, radio and online and there's still plenty of drama to come in week two." Iga Swiatek has stormed into a one-set lead over Danielle Collins on Centre Court. The eighth seed took only 39 minutes to win it 6-2 after breaking Collins in successive service games at 2-1 and 4-1. Defending champion Barbora Krejcikova took the first set 6-2 against No.10 seed Emma Navarro on Court 1. It's the middle Saturday of Wimbledon and fans are enjoying a day out at the All England Club. And down by Court 7, where doubles veteran and multi-Grand Slam champion Pierre-Hugues Herbert has teamed up with Jordan Thompson, there's standstill foot traffic. Carlos Alcaraz insists that the 'nightlife world' has nothing to do with him being less consistent than Jannik Sinner. Former Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios has tipped Sinner to enjoy a more successful tennis career than Alcaraz because the Spaniard 'likes girls' and 'might party too much'. There was more than a hint of a dig in Alcaraz's response as he claimed to be unmoved about eye-catching comments like those coming from Kyrgios. "They're funny comments, which coming from him doesn't surprise me," said the five-time Grand Slam winner. "It's no secret that Jannik has fewer ups and downs than me. It has nothing to do with the nightlife world." Jannik Sinner said he was in a rush to get off Centre Court so he could watch the final qualifying session of the British Grand Prix. "No [I'm not going to the race on Sunday], no I have to focus on this tournament. I will manage my practice sessions around the race. "I might get off and see the last rounds but it's going to be exciting. She has just lost 7-6(6), 6-3 to Clara Tauson on Court 2 Jannik Sinner rapidly wraps up the third set. The top seed wins 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 in one hour and 55 minutes. Jannik Sinner has put one foot into the fourth round. Wimbledon wonderkid Mirra Andreeva has an ominous message for her SW19 rivals. The 18-year-old thrashed Hailey Baptiste - a player five years her senior - on Court 1 earlier today. And she didn't drop a set in either of the two previous rounds. As the seventh seeds eyes up the big prize, she believes that her standards are improving with each passing match. Tomorrow's order of play is out, and British No. 3 Sonay Kartal will be making her Centre Court debut! The full Wimbledon order of play is here. Pedro Martinez is still battling shoulder problems but he is somehow growing into this game on Centre Court. But a medical time-out seems to have done the trick. All hope is not lost, then, even if his chances are still extremely remote. After rain delayed play on the outdoor courts this morning, we finally have some singles winners. 7 seed Mirra Andreeva - the highest seed left in this half of the draw - stormed past Hailey Baptiste 6-1 6-3 on Court 1, which has a roof. Meanwhile, Liudmila Samsonova beat Daria Kasatkina 6-2 6-3 on Court 3. Pedro Martinez has taken a medical time out on Centre Court while trailing Jannik Sinner 0-5. The Spaniard's shoulder was already strapped up and it's causing him all sorts of trouble. They've only spent 20 minutes on court so far. Chris Evert has hailed Emma Raducanu after she valiantly fought Aryna Sabalenka on Centre Court last night. ER has had a rough, rough four years but she has found renewed purpose in her game. At the end we saw why Sabalenka is world No.1 - she can pull herself out of holes when she is losing. "She was ahead both sets - 4-2 and then 4-1 against the No.1 player int he world. And she didn't do anything bad to lose that match. She just played against the No.1 player who has that experience. And she has a great coach too." It's Sporting Saturday at Wimbledon, when British athletes are invited into the Royal Box to take in the action on Centre Court. Ahead of the first match, Jannik Sinner vs Pedro Martinez, Clare Balding is paying tribute to the sportsmen and women inside the box in a special ceremony before play gets underway. Andy Roddick, Sir Jason and Dame Laura Kenny, Fran Kirby, and Dame Denis Lewis are among those watching on today. An official announcement has just been made over the tannoy here at Wimbledon that there will be no play until at least 1.30pm on the outside courts. However, spectators were told that the weather is looking "optimistic" thereafter. Britain's Billie Jean King Cup captain Anne Keothavong was impressed with Emma Raducanu's performance during her tight straight-set defeat to Aryna Sabalenka on Friday night. Keothavong found herself questioning whether Raducanu could sustain her level against the world No. She told the BBC: "I do think if Emma can really take confidence, which I hope she will take confidence from this performance and continue to build, then I have no doubt that we'll see her at the top of the game in no time. "There were times where I was wondering, ‘Gosh, this is so good, is she going to be able to sustain it?' For a lot of the time, for most this match, I think she surprised a lot of people that she was able to challenge the world No. Novak Djokovic's former coach, Goran Ivanisevic, has tipped him to upset Jannik Sinner at Wimbledon this year. Sinner has won their last four meetings but Djokovic boasts two victories in their only meetings at Wimbledon, in 2022 and 2023. "I don't think anyone can beat Djokovic before the semis, and he's never lost to Sinner here," Ivanisevic told CLAY. "OK, Australian Open and Roland Garros, but here Novak's beaten him twice. "In my view, Novak's the favourite, no matter how sentimental that sounds. Everyone says this is his last chance — I don't agree. Umpire Arnaud Gabas looked terrified as he was hastily wheeled off Court 2 while still sat in his chair. Rain began to fall while Clara Tauson held serve against Elena Rybakina to make the score 4-4 in the first set. Gabas was wheeled backwards off the court in his 6ft 9in chair and it appeared to snag on something on the ground, causing him to jerk forwards. He puffed out his cheekys after coming close to falling from the height. Stefanos Tsitsipas has been told not to play tennis until he sorts out his problems on and off the court by coach Goran Ivanisevic. Tsitsipas' trip to Wimbledon this year was as disastrous as it was short-lived, with the two-time Grand Slam finalist and former world No.3 retiring after two sets of his first-round match against Valentin Royer. I can't understand how a player of his level can be so unfit. After that, he can think about playing tennis again." He added: "I didn't expect him to do well. His situation is clear: if he changes certain things on the court, and above all off the court, he'll be fine. But if he doesn't manage to change those things, then he doesn't have a chance." Play has been suspended on the outside courts due to rain. 8 seed Iga Swiatek will be hoping to get revenge over Danielle Collins when they meet in the second match on Centre Court today. Nick Kyrgios claims he was searched by Wimbledon security and initially denied his credentials because he did not bring a valid form of ID. He said: "I said, 'do you reckon you could get me in and give me my credentials just one time' and she was like: 'No.' They told me to put all of my stuff down and I got body searched." John McEnroe once invited Wimbledon star Carlos Alcaraz to 'come over to his place sometime' after raving about his positive attitude on the court. Alcaraz is known as one of the smiliest players on tour, with his demeanour a sharp contrast to that of the fiery McEnroe during his playing days. After watching the Spaniard in action at SW19 last year, McEnroe joked that he could come to his house and give him private advice on how to be more upbeat. "You watch Carlos Alcaraz and he's always smiling, whatever the score is. I don't know how he does it but it's never too late to teach an old man. Sabalenka said: "That's more to have an extra racket, maybe not in your bag, but your team," the world No.1 explained. "For example, my team, they always have like two extra racquet with the higher tension and two extra racquets with lower tension. You don't have to wait for another racquet. I didn't have a right tension. I had to play with a lower tension. You can wake up and feel great with one tension. British teenagers Mika Stojsavljevic and Hannah Klugman will begin their junior girls' singles campaigns on Saturday after losing early in the main draw. Stojsavljevic and Klugman, both aged 16, were two of three teenagers to receive wildcards into the women's singles draw here, along with Mingge 'Mimi' Xu. But all three of them lost in the first round, and two of them have gone back to the juniors. 2 seed Klugman - who reached the junior French Open final last month - faces Sol Ailin Larraya Guidi third on Court 12. Immediately after, Stojsavljevic will face Mia Pohankova. Emma Raducanu suggested there was an issue with the electronic line calling system at Wimbledon on Friday, and said she wanted to see it fixed. "It's just, like, I've had a few in my other matches, too, that have been very wrong. There was an incident on Centre Court during Taylor Fritz's match against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. Play was paused with Fritz leading 6-4 2-1 for a medical emergency in the crowd. BBC commentator John McEnroe said: "Someone right beside us Simon is in some distress, they've stopped the match." There was a four-minute delay and Fritz brought over some water to help the spectator as medical personnel took to the stands. McEnroe later said: "She's conscious, for the elderly, it should be shade only." Aryna Sabalenka said she learned from her crushing French Open final defeat to Coco Gauff - and the backlash she received after suggesting her mistakes gave Gauff the win - before facing Emma Raducanu at Wimbledon. 1 came back from a break down in both sets to beat the Brit 7-6 6-4 on Friday night and said: "I'm kind of happy for what happened to me at the French Open because I had chance to sit back and to look at everything in perspective and realise a lot of things about myself. Yeah, as you said, because of the recent experience, I was just keep telling myself, 'No, you just cannot let it happen again. Whatever happens on the court, you just have to be respectful, you have to be calm, and you just have to keep trying and keep fighting'." "It's nice of her to say that, but I think it was pretty clear the difference,' said the British star. "In the big moments, she was able to convert, she was able to hit some incredible shots. I just need to keep working and get back to the drawing board and improve a lot more." There was a strange moment for Cam Norrie in his post-match press conference yesterday. A journalist said to him: “Some of the gossip has been about who Emma Raducanu is dating. Can I ask if you're dating her?" The journalist in question ploughed on with: “I'm trying to find out who's dating Emma Raducanu. It seems to be going around all the men's singles. I was wondering if you're dating her, please?” Goran Ivanisevic has spoken crudely about his return to coaching. He's currently working with Stefanos Tsitsipas, who went out in the first round at Wimbledon, after a trial stint with Elena Rybakina “I rested just fine for nine months,” he said, on his lay-off. I got a tennis player who is the first favourite at Wimbledon, who can win the Grand Slam. “Then I got out of that situation, rested for four months and then I got into a good situation again. I began to think that something was wrong with me. Or people think that I am the one who solves these problems." So on Centre Court today, men's top seed Jannik Sinner will start things off against Pedro Martinez. He'll be followed by Iga Swiatek v Danielle Collins and then Novak Djokovic plays Miomir Kecmanovic. A Super Saturday awaits.Tap below for the full Order of Play \u2b07\ufe0f#Wimbledon Naomi Osaka admitted she was releived to have finished the grass court season after her defeat to Katerina Siniakova. "I'm just going to be a negative human being today. I have nothing positive to say about myself. Carlos Alcaraz was left seething with the technology during his four set win over JL Struff last night. I would have asked for a challenge. “Having a match like that where I had chances in both sets, it does give me confidence. At the same time, it's very difficult to take right now," she said. "I think it's better for me to kind of feel a bit of the pain right now and then process it better that way. It's hard to take a loss like that." Welcome back to our live Wimbledon coverage. Another big day in store with men's world No.1 Jannik Sinner, Novak Djokovic, and Iga Swiatek among the big names in action.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An interesting observer has been spotted in the stands: Emma Raducanu with her coach Mark Petchey. Rublev dumps a backhand into the net and it puts him in trouble at 0-30. Then the third when he nets a forehand return. He gets another chance with Rublev nets a backhand. And this time he gets the job, breaking when he drills a backhand return down the line and Rublev fails to get his forehand into play. He responds to that mistake with an ace. And safely holds again when Rublev pushes a backhand wide under pressure. You get there is a great deal of anger in Rublev's ball striking. Seems to be hitting the ball even harder. Alcaraz jokingly called himself a ‘servebot' at Queen's last month. Will that little break help Rublev get back on track? Now two sets to one up, he is in the mood. Rublev has headed off court for a toilet break. Taking one last opportunity to enjoy the Centre Court facilities, perhaps. Because, bold as he has been, you can't see him coming back from this. Aces 13 and 14 to start the game from Alcaraz. Forehand return into the net brings up three set points. Alcaraz drop shot, Rublev chases after it and gets there but can't get his reply into court. Rublev hasn't done much wrong but is looking at being two sets to one down and on the brink of defeat. A fifth ace of the match allows him to hold here. Break consolidated by Alcaraz with a hold to 30. Sure he is error prone, but when he can produce a winner like that, when he not only reached a ball apparently completely beyond an ordinary mortal but returned it with a fizzing winner his opponent barely saw, then there is only one response. And the Centre Court crowd was on its feet in appreciation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cameron Norrie through to quarter-finals where he could face Carlos Alcaraz; Follow scores, reports and our dedicated live blog over the next fortnight; The US Open is live on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, streaming service NOW and the Sky Sports app from August 24 Britain's last remaining hope in singles Cameron Norrie made it through to the quarter-finals of Wimbledon after beating Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry in five sets. However, Norrie held his nerve in the decider and did not drop serve all day in a 6-3 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (7-9) 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 victory over a gruelling four hours and 27 minutes to return to the last eight for the first time since 2022. Norrie, who has now won nine of his 10 matches on his favourite Court One, said: "I hung tough when I needed to and the atmosphere was so good. "Credit to Nico, he did an unbelievable job staying with me. "It's my coach's birthday and I forgot to get him a present, so I got him the win." Jarry, 6ft 7in South American, was clearly unhappy about something at the end, with the two players engaged in a long, heated conversation after shaking hands. "He said I was a little bit vocal, but that's my energy. Jarry hit 103 winners, 46 aces, loses in five sets and four hours and 27 minutes Incredible effort from Norrie, who reaches a second career Grand Slam quarter-finals, both at Wimbledon. He took the second on a tie-break and had match point in the third-set tiebreak, only for towering Jarry to save it and force a fourth set, which he sealed with an ace. Jarry, who has seen his ranking plummet from 16 this time last year to 143 due to a health issue which has affected his vision and balance came through qualifying before knocking out eighth seed Holger Rune, American Learner Tien and Brazilian wonderkid Joao Fonseca to reach the fourth round. He banged down 46 aces to take his tournament-leading tally to 111, but Norrie returned superbly to break early in the decider, save three break points in the next game and close out victory in a marathon encounter. Sonay Kartal's fine Wimbledon run ended with a fourth-round loss to veteran Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Kartal was eventually overpowered by the 34-year-old former French Open finalist in a 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 defeat, but the result was overshadowed by a problem with the electronic line-calling system that led Pavlyuchenkova to allege home bias. On game point serving at 4-4, Pavlyuchenkova was convinced a Kartal shot had landed long but the technology was not working at the time - which Wimbledon organisers later attributed to human error - and the point was replayed. "STOP STOP" was heard across the court and confusion then reigned as umpire Nico Helwerth picked up his telephone for advice. Television replays showed that Pavlyuchenkova was correct and the ball had landed well out. Pavlyuchenkova went on to lose the game, leaving Kartal serving for the opening set, and she furiously told umpire Nico Helwerth at the change of ends: "Because she is local, they can say whatever. Fired-up by the injustice of it all, she showed true grit to raise her game and from then on was the better player, striking a total of 36 winners to Kartal's 14 as she moved through to the quarter-finals here for the first time since losing at that stage to Serena Williams in 2016. "It was a very crucial moment in the match. That's why he's there sitting on the chair. Like during Covid, we didn't have ball boys. It just becomes a little bit weird and robot sort of orientated. "They're very good at giving fines, though, and code violations. While she had hoped to go further, the consolation for Kartal is that she will hit a new career-high ranking next Monday of around 44 and will surpass her childhood rival Emma Raducanu as British No 2. Kartal said: "I'm obviously pretty devastated to not get the win. People were saying to me that the draw had really opened up but I think she played like a seed today. She played two games which was almost unplayable for me. I think that was the only difference today. I'm going to go away with a lot of motivation." World No 1 Aryna Sabalenka maintained her stranglehold over Belgian Elise Mertens with a hard-fought 6-4 7-6 (7-4) victory to reach the quarter-finals as she bids for a maiden title at the grass-court Grand Slam.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz moved into the Wimbledon quarterfinals when Jordan Thompson quit with an injury in the second set of their fourth-round match LONDON — U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz moved into the Wimbledon quarterfinals for the third time in four years on Sunday, advancing when his injured opponent, Jordan Thompson , quit while trailing 6-1, 3-0 after 41 minutes. The unseeded Thompson's movement and power clearly were compromised. “Just got significantly worse today,” said Thompson, who was competing in singles and doubles at Wimbledon. “Just played a lot of tennis on a body that shouldn't have been, and it just took its toll.” 5-seeded Fritz , it was a shorter workday after playing a pair of five-setters and one four-setter earlier in the tournament. “It's obviously not the way that I want to go through,” Fritz said. 17 seed Karen Khachanov of Russia on Tuesday for a berth in the semifinals — a round neither has reached at the All England Club. Khachanov has been a Grand Slam semifinalist twice, at the U.S. Open in 2022 and the Australian Open in 2023. Fritz made it that far at a major for the first time when he got to the final at Flushing Meadows in September before losing to No. Khachanov beat Kamil Majchrzak 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 Sunday and is 2-0 against Fritz, although their most recent meeting was in 2020. “We practice all the time, so we're pretty familiar with each other's games,” Fritz said. “But I think I improved a ton and have become a much, much better player since the last time we played.” 1 Aryna Sabalenka reached the quarterfinals at her 11th consecutive Grand Slam tournament, defeating No. 24 Elise Mertens 6-4, 7-6 (4), and will play unseeded Laura Siegemund , the 37-year-old German who followed up her elimination of Australian Open champ Madison Keys by beating lucky loser Solana Sierra 6-3, 6-2. When Siegemund's age was mentioned during an on-court interview, the crowd applauded, and she joked: “It's not that often you get such a compliment for being old.” Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova overcame a missed call late in the first set when the electronic system that replaced line judges at Wimbledon this year was shut off but ended up beating Sonay Kartal 7-6 (3), 6-4 to return to the grass-court major's quarterfinals for the first time in nine years. In men's action, the last British singles player, 2022 semifinalist Cam Norrie, advanced with a 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-7 (7), 6-7 (5), 6-3 win over qualifier Nicolas Jarry of Chile. The 61st-ranked Norrie, who played college tennis at TCU in Fort Worth, Texas, will go up against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz or No. 14 Andrey Rublev for a spot in the final four. The quarterfinals will be set after Monday's play, which leads off at Centre Court with 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic against No. They were supposed to face each other in last year's quarterfinals at Wimbledon, but de Minaur was forced to withdraw before the match with a hip injury. 10 Emma Navarro , who eliminated 2024 champion Barbora Krejcikova in the third round, and then No. Others in action: Iga Swiatek, Ben Shelton and Marin Cilic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cameron Norrie kept alive home hopes at Wimbledon on Sunday, when he rallied past big-serving Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry in a five-set epic on No. Backed by a raucous crowd, the British lefty recovered from squandering one match point on the Jarry serve in the third-set tie-break and a 4/2 lead in the fourth-set breaker to eventually seal a battling 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-7(7), 6-7(5), 6-3 triumph. After earning victory two hours and one minute afer his first match point, Norrie collapsed to the ground before he rose to his feet to let out a vocal roar, which reverberated around the closed-roofed No. He did an unbelievable job," Norrie said. I forgot to get my coach a birthday present today, so I had to get the win for him! "He hung in there but I kept taking care of my serve. WINNING AT HOME ❤️Norrie takes down Jarry in a five set blockbuster to seal his spot in the quarters 🍿🌱@wimbledon | #wimbledon pic.twitter.com/VOpLhMC6T4 Norrie is just the fourth British player in the Open Era to reach the quarter-finals at Wimbledon on multiple occasions, joining two-time champion Andy Murray, Tim Henman and Roger Taylor. Norrie will look to return to the semi-finals again on Tuesday when he meets two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz or 14th seed Andrey Rublev in his second major quarter-final. "At the beginning of this year, I struggled with confidence. However, the former Indian Wells champion has since gone 10-4, also reaching the fourth round at Roland Garros. He is up 18 spots to No. 43 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following his latest win. Jarry has struggled with a nerve disorder in his ear in the past year but looked impressive on London's lawns through the first three rounds. The qualifier upset Top 10 star Holger Rune in the first round and then eliminated #NextGenATP stars Learner Tien and Joao Fonseca to equal his best result at a major. He fired 103 winners in the match and saved one match point on serve at 5/6 in the third-set tie-break when he backed up a big serve with a heavy forehand. He then found four first serves from 15/40 down at 2-2 in the fourth set to hold and clinched the set in another tie-break. However, he finally ran out of steam in the decider, with Norrie staying focused, consistent and aggressive to advance after four hours and 27 minutes in the pair's second Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting (1-1). 95 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CENTRE COURT, THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB — Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova suggested her British opponent may have received preferential treatment as simmering tensions around Wimbledon's use of electronic line calling (ELC) instead of line judges boiled over Sunday, when the technology malfunctioned at a crucial point on Centre Court. Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova was serving at 4-4, Ad-40 in the first set of her fourth-round match against Britain's Sonay Kartal, when Kartal hit a backhand that clearly bounced out. Pavlyuchenkova was waiting for the call, and umpire Nico Helwerth stopped the point before an automated sound saying “stop, stop” could be heard. This was despite television footage confirming that Kartal's shot had been well long, and that the point and the game should have been Pavlyuchenkova's. A spokesperson for the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) said: “In that time there were three calls not picked up by live ELC on the affected part of the court. Two of these were called by the Chair Umpire, who was not made aware that the system had been deactivated. It was determined that the point should be replayed. There is no mention of ELC in the 2025 Grand Slam rulebook. This protocol applies only to point-ending shots or in the case when a player stops play.” She doubled down on this position after the match. Asked again whether she had definitely thought at the time that the error was because Kartal was a home player, Pavlyuchenkova responded: “I have to be honest, I did. I thought so because it was very weird.” The AELTC did not respond to this suggestion nor that of favouritism for Kartal. “It feels like justice,” said British coach and former player Anne Keothavong in commentary for the BBC. She then kept her focus to win the match 7-6(3), 6-4. “I think we should have a wire system like in football they have or something, so then it's clear for everybody and we can move on right away instead of just guessing. It could sit with me for the rest of the match and then kind of unknown, was it in or out and kind of feeling that it was my game,” she said. Even before the tournament started, there had been plenty of resistance from Wimbledon traditionalists at the decision to dispense with line judges. Ahead of the tournament, All England Club chief executive Sally Bolton said that replacing line judges with ELC was “inevitable”. Players are generally in favor of the technology, believing it to be more reliable and removing any need on their part to self-officiate. But there have been complaints in the first week of Wimbledon from some high-profile players — including both British No.1s. First Jack Draper said Thursday: “I don't think it's 100 percent accurate, in all honesty,” as he reflected on a wide serve from his opponent that he was sure was out. Afterwards she said that the call in question was “for sure out.” It's just, like, I've had a few in my other matches, too, that have been very wrong.” Replays of the call, a Sabalenka serve, were inconclusive. Players have been educated about marks sometimes being deceptive, but Alexander Zverev and others took photos of the clay after what they believed were inaccurate calls. Whether or not they had the correct marks is unknown. On Saturday, All England Club chair Debbie Jevans hit back at the player criticism, telling the BBC that: “It's funny, because when we did have linesmen, we were constantly asked why we didn't have electronic line calling because it's more accurate than the rest of the tour.” Fritz thought the point should have been his once the ball was confirmed as being out, but per the rules it had to be replayed because Fritz had not stopped play.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There has been some hype beyond the happenings at Wimbledon about 59-year-old billionaire and tennis enthusiast Bill Ackman attempting to become the oldest player to earn an ATP ranking point at the Hall of Fame Open Challenger event in Newport, R.I. Mulloy “earned” his ranking point at a Grand Prix event played in North Miami, Florida played at tennis facility called the California Club, where Mulloy was the head teaching pro. In those days of the ATP computer, players earned a ranking point simply by playing in a Grand Prix event and one didn't have to win a match (now, you have to win a match to ear a ranking point) Mulloy only managed to win one game in the first round of singles falling to 23-year-old former NCAA singles champion John Whitlinger 6-0, 6-1 In doubles at the event, Mulloy partnered with Paul Smith of Australia and lost in the first round to Armistead Neely and Alvaro Fillol 6-2, 6-4. Mulloy played competitive tennis into his 90s and won over 100 USTA age group national championships. Ackman will play doubles in Newport with former Wimbledon and U.S. Open doubles champion Jack Sock, who hasn't played a professional tennis match since losing in the first round of the 2023 U.S. Open, where he announced he was retiring from tennis to play professional pickleball. Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital Management, said in media interviews that he is playing the best tennis of his life. He does annually compete in an event called “The Finance Cup,” among top tennis-playing financers and he reportedly reached the semifinals at the recent event, also held in Newport, alongside former U.S. Open doubles champion Richey Reneberg. Ackman wrote on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that Sock was offered the wild card by tournament officials and that he chose to play with him. Earlier this year, Ackman said that he and Nick Kyrgios had discussed playing in a lower-level Challenger or Futures level event together for fun. The oldest current ATP doubles ranked player is 47-year-old Toshihide Matsui of Japan. The oldest ranked ATP singles player is 44-year-old Ryan Haviland, who re-entered the ATP singles rankings in May, as I discuss in my “TennisPublisher” podcast here: https://www.swellcast.com/t/O1UqB9NxBjx6VDB Denmark's Lars Elvstrom, incidentally, is the second oldest player to earn an ATP ranking. Elvstrom partnered with the player he was coaching, fellow Dane Kristian Pless, and they advanced into the second round by walkover when Prakash Amritraj and Travis Rettenmaier pulled out of the doubles competition, which strangely only featured 12 teams that entered. Elvstrom, who reached a career-high ranked of No.280 in 1978, and Pless, the former world No. 65, lost in the quarterfinals to Illya Marchenko and Alexander Kudryavtsev 6-2, 6-1. Ackman, age 59 and nearly two months (born May 11, 1966), would become the second oldest player to earn an ATP ranking if he is able to win a match in Newport as his point(s) would not drop off until after he turns 60. Buying a wild card (providing anything of financial value in exchange for a wild card) is against rules of the International Tennis Integrity Agency and players, tournaments and promoters are subject to severe punishment in the form of fines and suspensions if found to buy a wild card or sell a wild card.. The International Tennis Hall of Fame is hosting a combined men's and women's Challenger level tournament for the first time in 2025, as you can read here https://worldtennismagazine.com/tennis-hall-of-fame-to-host-combined-mens-womens-challenger-starting-in-2025-to-continue-world-class-tennis-legacy/23536.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kartal wins controversial game after electronic line-calling system fails Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova said a game was 'stolen' from her when Wimbledon's electronic line-calling system failed during her fourth-round match against Britain's Sonay Kartal. There was no 'out' call when a Kartal backhand went long at 4-4 in the first set, with chair umpire Nico Helwerth halting play. Russian Pavlyuchenkova had seen the ball was out -  and a TV replay showed that was the case by some distance. Addressing the crowd, Helwerth said: "We're just going to check if the system was up and running, because there was no audio call." Umpires can decide to make their own call if the system breaks down and are also entitled to replay the point. Instead, it was replayed, Kartal won the point and went on to break for a 5-4 lead. He probably was scared to take such a big decision." She told the umpire: "I don't know if it's in or out. Debbie Jevans - chair of the All England Club - said on Friday she was confident in its accuracy and the decision to bring it in. Electronic line-calling technology has been under scrutiny this week at Wimbledon, with a number of players saying they do not trust it. Such an obvious failure on the biggest stage - on Centre Court, in a match featuring a British player - has ensured this topic will not go away. Britain's Emma Raducanu has been one of those to voice concerns, saying some of the calls had been "dodgy", while former Olympic champion Belinda Bencic said the technology was a topic of discussion among players in the locker room. Bencic said she was usually a fan of the technology but "it is not correct" at this tournament. 'I can't hear it' - Wimbledon's first day of electronic calling Britain's Billie Jean King Cup captain Anne Keothavong said the error was something the tournament referee and organisers would have to "reflect on" and see "what could have been done better". "If there is uncertainty, that creates anxiety," she said on BBC TV. "Hopefully we don't see mistakes like this again." Former world number one Tracy Austin said the fault had been a "one-off". "An interesting, dramatic situation that I'm sure we will fix in the future but it was tough to watch for those few minutes," the American added. When there were line judges, players could challenge the calls by using an electronic review.

Laura Siegemund will face history-making lucky loser Solana Sierra in the Wimbledon 2025 fourth round, a matchup few predicted, but one that's now impossible to ignore. 1, has become the first lucky loser in the Open Era to reach the second week at Wimbledon, taking out ninth seed Paula Badosa, Katie Boulter, and Cristina Bucsa, all in grueling three-setters. Grass Masterclass 👏@laurasiegemund is through to Round 4 at Wimbledon for the first time after defeating the reigning Australian Open champion!#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/cVAbBTCcxM Siegemund, meanwhile, has breezed past her opposition, including sixth seed Madison Keys, Leylah Fernandez, and Peyton Stearns, all in straight sets. While singles success has largely disappointed her this season, she's remained sharp through doubles, picking up a title in Nottingham and a runner-up finish in Adelaide. Despite modest singles numbers with 10 aces and 59.4% first-serve points won, 32.2% break-point conversion shows her opportunistic edge. Laura Siegemund's reaction after beating Madison Keys at Wimbledon. Sierra's rise has mostly come through the Challenger circuit, with a title in Antalya and deep runs in Cancun and Valencia. Until now, she hadn't advanced past the first round at a main-draw WTA event this year, making her Wimbledon surge all the more stunning. With a 55.6% first-serve win rate and 40% break-point conversion, Sierra may lack top-tier polish, but her grit is undeniable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Flavio Cobolli has marched through to the Wimbledon fourth round after dismissing Czechia's Jakub Mensik. Despite a rain delay postponing the match, Cobolli's momentum was rarely halted on Saturday, with the Italian triumphing 6-1 7-6 6-3 against his opponent – who recently admitted he has barely played on grass. The Italian, who is a future star on the ATP Tour, has spoken about his tennis influences and idols, including Novak Djokovic. Cobolli, who admitted he doesn't like to watch tennis, said his idol is ‘one of the most talented players ever.' Speaking to the Tennis Channel on Monday, Cobolli named a surprise player as ‘one of the most talented players ever.' The Italian, who has reached his first Grand Slam fourth round, noted the influence of Fabio Fognini on his tennis career. I don't want to watch any match. I started to play tennis because of him (Fognini) in Italy. I think he's one of the most talented players ever and yeah we have a big relationship, we are good friends. I watch the match here he play on Wimbledon. Fognini, who was making his final appearance at SW19 this year and is expected to retire in 2025, produced a valiant performance in the first round against French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz, before losing in five sets. Cilic, winner of the 2014 US Open, hit 50 unforced errors against Munar. However, he offset this alarming statistic by totalling 47 winners. Cobolli and Cilic are set to face off on Monday, with the winner to play either Novak Djokovic or Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Goran Ivanisevic is unafraid to hold back what he really thinks about the current state of the ATP Tour. The Croatian is used to success as a coach, with Ivanisevic previously mentoring Novak Djokovic and Marin Cilic to a combined 10 Grand Slam titles. However, things have not got off to the best start, with Ivanisevic publicly criticising Tsitsipas after his first round defeat at Wimbledon. The 2001 Wimbledon champion has not left it there, with Ivanisevic now making some strong comments about the ATP Tour including Ben Shelton. In an interview with Clay, Ivanisevic was asked many questions including what he thought about the current state of the ATP Tour. While he heaped praise on world number four Jack Draper, who was beaten by Cilic at Wimbledon this year, Ivanisevic admitted that he found the instability of the ATP Tour ‘sad'. “Honestly, I first saw Draper when Novak played him in the first round here at Wimbledon in 2021,” said Ivanisevic. Tommy Paul, Shelton… I can't say they're better players than Tsitsipas. “And Novak is still there, though at the end of his career. Sinner and Alcaraz have shared the last six Grand Slam titles between them, highlighted by the most recent Roland Garros final that has been called one of the best major finals ever. After his strong claim about the ATP Tour, Ivanisevic was subsequently asked if he thinks anyone can close the gap. The only player that he suggested can currently challenge Alcaraz and Sinner at a major is Djokovic, who Ivanisevic has made a Wimbledon prediction about. “I don't see anyone who can do that — unless someone beats them up the night before (laughter). “Look at the Australian Open final — you had [Alexander] Zverev, world No. “Then you see the Roland Garros final — that was otherworldly tennis. The only one who can come between them is Novak.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic has become only the second men's player to reach 100 match wins at Wimbledon, but how does his record compare to his two great rivals Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer at the four respective Grand Slams? For Djokovic, though, it is yet another milestone on his impressive list of achievements with win No 100 coming with a straight-set win over Miomir Kecmanovic in the third round at this year's grass-court Grand Slam. I am very grateful and privileged to be in this position. I never take anything for granted, especially at this age,” the Serbian said. Novak Djokovic's former coach issues ‘last chance' verdict on Grand Slam hopes Djokovic, though, looks set to surpass that milestone as the Serbian currently sits on 99 while two-time champion Nadal had 77 wins Down Under. With 14 titles at Roland Garros, Nadal was always going to be No 1 with match wins in Paris as he has a record 112 victories with only four (4) defeats in 19 main draw appearances. Federer won eight Wimbledon trophies and he recorded his 100th win in 2019, but won only another five matches at SW19 before retiring. The grass-court major is Nadal's worst in terms of the Slams as he won 58 matches at Wimbledon, having made only 15 main draw appearances. First things first, Jimmy Connors has the record for most victories at the US Open as he won 98 matches. Djokovic, though, sits second with 90 and he could potentially move to 97 this year, but then he would have to win the tournament. Five-time US Open champion Federer retired with 89 while Nadal – a four-time champion in New York – notched up 67 wins during his career. Djokovic might not hold the record for the individual tournaments, but he has the record for total Grand Slam wins as he sits on 390 and counting, ahead of Federer (369) and Nadal (314). "[Djokovic] has had a very irregular season, with certainly incomprehensible defeats, but..." Novak Djokovic has claimed there are big similarities between his game and Jannik Sinner's. Novak Djokovic's countryman has rated his level compared to Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. Djokovic set another Grand Slam record with his round-three win at Wimbledon in 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I tell this to people all the time and they either laugh right away or throw an incredulous look at me. Of course, he was also only 11 years old. In the 16 years I've known the 7-foot professional tennis player and former Indian Trails Middle School student, I've seen him in all kinds of mental states. Or when he won his first ATP Tour title, on Long Island at the New York Open in 2019. I was fortunate to be in attendance that whole week, and afterwards he couldn't stop grinning as we reminisced about his first coach, former tennis star Tom Gullikson, and their practice sessions at Grand Haven and elsewhere. I've seen him surprised, and a little shell-shocked, such as when he won the Junior Boys title at Wimbledon in 2015, and he insisted to me on the phone after the match that it wasn't that big a deal, even though it of course very much was. I've seen him angry, such as when things weren't going his way during his slow and steady climb up the ladder of the ATP Tour. Like all tennis players (except maybe Jannik Sinner, who never seems to get angry), Opelka has sometimes snapped at lines judges and chair umpires, because this tennis thing is a very frustrating sport. So yeah, I've seen Opelka in just about every mood there is. But Thursday afternoon, in Interview Room 5 in the Media Pavilion here at Wimbledon, I saw a guy who looked defeated. Depressed, frustrated and at a loss as to what's going on with his career. Opelka has worked so hard these last few years to come back from injury; he endured a horrific botched wrist surgery, had another operation to fix it, and was off the pro tour for more two years, until returning last July. When Opelka finally made it back, he was thrilled just to be healthy again, and knew that he'd need a few months to shake the rust off and start moving back up the tennis ladder. 17 in the world just a few years ago, and on the verge of making a major Grand Slam breakthrough. Many, including John McEnroe, said he'd win Wimbledon one day, what with his rocketship of a serve that goes above 140 miles per hour and zooms past hapless opponents after hitting the perfectly manicured green grass here. But it's been eight months, and Thursday at Wimbledon brought another second-round loss, this time to American Brandon Nakashima, in four sets. I lose second round every week, and it sucks. The big 28-year-old, who has lost in the second round of his last four events, said his tough defeats lately aren't physical. He said his body feels “really good” after ramping up and playing a regular schedule of tournaments in 2025. What has long been his most dangerous weapon is betraying him. When things are going well, Opelka gets 70-75 percent of his first serves in play, and wins 90 percent of those points. These last few months, Opelka said, he's getting 60 percent of his first serves in, and winning only 75 percent of those points. “Those are the only numbers that matter,” he said. Denis Kudla, a former pro who's been a traveling coach for Opelka for the past year, is more optimistic about how his player is doing. Reilly understands the process, and he's a professional. “You don't make any money losing second round every week. I hope this was just frustration talking, because after all the work and effort he's put in, I'd hate to see him quit. Then again, Opelka has always been a different cat, as they say, who was never totally single-minded about tennis. He's a lover of art, going to galleries in all the European cities he's been to while playing, and has struck up friendships with gallery owners like Tim van Laere in Belgium. But I hope that's not the case. It would only be fitting for the tallest tennis player in history to reach new heights before he's through. Michael Lewis has covered Reilly Opelka for FlaglerLive since 2013. Back when the Tennis Center was being expanded Holland-Alfin of 2021, this was a worst case fear I commented about back then, Alfin would sink money into “courts of dreams” as some investment into the community & the star player that it would be named after wouldn't have longevity for the sport of tennis, not achieve the titles. The tennis associations weren't guaranteeing tournaments for a player that lives in South Florida at this point, has been when tennis center expansion was a huge gamble. Several injuries and he's a long shot to make it past the 2nd round ? If he continues, he might want to only travel USA tournaments, maybe find a men's or mixed doubles partner ? International travel to lose in the 2nd round constantly, like he says, won't be even career earnings for breakeven for those trips to France (French Open), Italy (Italian Open), Spain (Madrid Open) & England (Wimbledon). Australia & other Asian tournaments might be something he has a better shot at. But from the reads of injury after injury, athletes that are 7 feet tall, when their body fails them, walking like a mere mortal is challenging enough. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
