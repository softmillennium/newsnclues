                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter Ben Shelton launched a public plea for his sister to get some extra time off from her job at investment bank Morgan Stanley so she could remain at Wimbledon to cheer for him. After advancing to face Italy's Lorenzo Sonego on Monday in the fourth round, Shelton spoke in an on-court interview in front of a crowd that included his sister, Emma, and his girlfriend, U.S. national soccer team star Trinity Rodman. "I've been playing well this week. It's not just been me here. She's been here for every match that I've played this tournament so far. She's been the lucky charm," said the 10th-seeded Shelton, a 22-year-old American who has appeared in two Grand Slam semifinals. "But she has work back in the U.S., starting on Monday. That drew some boos from spectators as Emma covered her face with her hands. "If any of you all have some (connections) and get her a couple extra days off so she can (stay and) we can keep this rolling," Shelton continued after his 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-2 victory over Marton Fucsovics of Hungary on Saturday, "that'd be great." Sure enough, hours later, Emma posted a short video on Instagram in which Ben is heard asking her, "You got the week off or what?" The caption reads "thank you MS" with three blue heart emojis and "return flight: cancelled." Ben Shelton, who won all nine sets he played in Week 1 at the All England Club, beat Sonego in the Australian Open quarterfinals in January. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk declared on X the formation of a new political party amid his ongoing feud with President Donald Trump over the "Big Beautiful Bill." "Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom," Musk wrote in an X post on Saturday afternoon. The Tesla CEO had said Friday on his social media platform that one way the new party could work is to focus on winning just a handful of Senate seats and House districts that could serve as the "deciding vote" on "contentious laws," given the "razor-thin legislative margins" in Congress. "Having earned the largest share of votes for a Republican presidential nominee and secured majorities in the House and Senate, and with his historic domestic policy agenda swiftly and successfully passed through One Big Beautiful Bill with resounding GOP support, the party is stronger than ever and in lockstep with the Trump agenda," Harrison Fields, the principal White House deputy press secretary, told BI over email. Fellow billionaire Mark Cuban, meanwhile, appeared — not for the first time — to support the idea of a new party, replying to Musk's Saturday announcement with a series of fireworks and fire emojis. That is their mission," Cuban wrote in another post. SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House communications director under Trump in 2017, also appeared interested. My DMs are open," he replied to Musk. Musk's "America Party" announcement came after he conducted a July 4 poll, asking X users if they want "independence" from the two-party system. Musk, who was a staunch supporter of Trump's 2024 reelection bid, has been publicly critical of the president's "Big Beautiful Bill," a sweeping domestic policy bill that includes extensive tax cuts and could add more than $3 trillion to the national debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Musk has characterized the bill on X as a form of "debt slavery." Just days after stepping away from his work at the White House DOGE Office, which was tasked with cutting spending and reducing the deficit, Musk in June called the legislation a "massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill." Trump even suggested that his office would look into possibly deporting Musk, a South African immigrant. Musk's back-and-forth regarding his involvement in political affairs has been followed by volatile times for the CEO of Tesla, his EV company. Wall Street analysts, including Tesla bull Dan Ives, have said that Musk's politics could lead the company astray if the chief executive doesn't snap back into focus. Earlier in June, Baird analysts downgraded the Tesla stock, noting that the Musk-Trump spat adds "uncertainty to TSLA's outlook.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You've probably worked hard to build positive relationships. As the author of "Managing Up," an executive coach to top performers at the world's biggest companies, and a professor of human behavior, I've seen how certain phrases — even ones that sound perfectly reasonable in your head — can chip away at trust. People may hesitate to share ideas or information with you. Here are five common phrases that can make you sound judgmental, even when you don't mean to be, and what to say instead. Maybe your friend is stressed about their inbox, and you mention, "Why don't you just set up filters?" Or your direct report is struggling to get buy-in on a decision, and you jump straight to, "Why don't you just schedule one-on-ones?" At a family gathering, someone mentions, "Grandma grew up in Ohio," and you jump in to clarify, "Actually, it was Michigan." Even small corrections like, "Actually, the deadline is Friday," can come off harsher than intended. Prefacing statements with "actually" can seem to imply, "You're wrong and I'm right," or, "You're not paying attention," and come off as condescending. Embrace "yes, and..." improv energy to build on others' ideas, not tear them down. Or you might use it to express feedback, like: "Honestly, we should consider other options." But saying "to be honest…" can subtly imply everything you said before wasn't truthful. Worse, it often signals criticism is coming, so people might get defensive before you've even made your point. If you're offering input, position your opinion as one possible perspective, not the only truth. You can also use words that invite open-mindedness like: What you mean is, "I don't understand your reasoning," but the subtext can be perceived as, "Your logic is flawed." Even if you're truly confused, this phrase puts the other person in the position of having to defend their intelligence. You might genuinely be caught off guard when someone isn't aware of information that seems fundamental or well-known to you. Sometimes it's even a nervous reflex if you feel awkward for not catching an oversight sooner. By expressing "surprise," you're inadvertently suggesting their lack of knowledge is unexpected and perhaps inappropriate for someone in their role. Focus on being helpful rather than highlighting their unfamiliarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's announcement of a U.S.-Vietnam trade deal and a solid June jobs report lifted stocks last week, but investors can still find plenty of opportunities to snap up names at attractive levels. The recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help inform investors as they search for the stocks of companies with strong fundamentals and solid growth opportunities. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. Following meetings with management, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated a buy rating on Dell with a price target of $150. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI analyst has an "outperform" rating on DELL with a price target of $128. Notably, Daryanani stated that he came away from the meetings incrementally positive about Dell's ability to deliver high-single-digit revenue growth and a double-digit increase in earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow (FCF). His optimism is backed by the initiatives taken by the company over the past two years to optimize its cost structure and tailwinds from key AI (artificial intelligence) investments. Daryanani added that Dell expects to benefit from acceleration in enterprise AI adoption over the next five to seven years. In fact, the company believes that higher-margin enterprise customers could account for the vast majority of AI server sales over time. Daryanani also noted Dell's confidence about navigating tariff woes, given that it "believes its diversified and global footprint is an advantage over its competitors." 187 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. See Dell Technologies Stock News and Insights on TipRanks. We move to Trade Desk (TTD), a cloud-based advertising platform that providers advertisers with cutting-edge technology to find new audiences and grow their brands. Recently, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney upgraded Trade Desk stock to Buy from Hold with a price forecast of $90. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI analyst has an "outperform" rating on TTD stock, but with a lower price target of $83. Mahaney views the pullback in TTD stock as an attractive buying opportunity "to get involved again in what has proved over time to be one of the highest quality and most consistent performers across the Internet landscape." Explaining his bullish stance, Mahaney stated that recent checks have indicated that online ad demand sentiment has clearly improved since April/May, though uncertainty about the second half of the year remains significant. He added that the checks reflect a clear improvement in Trade Desk's execution. Mahaney mentioned that checks indicated a clear improvement in the company's execution, both on product and go-to-market strategy. While the analyst acknowledged increasing competition from Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP), he highlighted that Google's DV360 and not Trade Desk is more likely to be impacted due to its overlap with the areas where AMZN is strong. Finally, Mahaney thinks that Trade Desk's set-ups for the remainder of fiscal 2025 look quite achievable, with his billings analysis suggesting that the company is very likely to exit 2025 at premium growth levels (excluding political spend). 214 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. See Trade Desk Ownership Structure on TipRanks. This week's third pick is e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN). In a research note dated July 1, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reaffirmed a buy rating and increased the Amazon stock price forecast to $255 from $250. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI analyst has assigned an "outperform" rating on AMZN stock with a price target of $233. Thill raised his price target after Jefferies' proprietary survey of nearly 700 U.S. consumers in mid-/late June indicated that Amazon "remains resilient despite price increases related to tariffs, with stable spend levels and upside if pricing on other websites becomes more expensive." Notably, 73% of respondents reported having a Prime membership, compared to 26% for rival Walmart. The analyst said that given the heightened focus on prices, Amazon's Prime Day event could turn out to be more popular and impactful by running for four days instead of two (from July 8 to July 11 vs. July 16 to July 17 in 2024) across 20 countries. He expects the event to result in incremental Prime memberships, particularly among students and young adults ages 18 to 24 via six-month extended free trials. 109 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China's finance ministry said on Sunday it was restricting government purchases of medical devices from the European Union that exceed 45 million yuan ($6.3 million) in value, in retaliation to Brussels' own curbs last month. Tensions between Beijing and Brussels have been rising, with the European Union imposing tariffs on China-built electric vehicles and Beijing slapping duties on imported brandy from the bloc. The European Union said last month it was barring Chinese companies from participating in EU public tenders for medical devices worth 60 billion euros ($70 billion) or more per year after concluding that EU firms were not given fair access in China. China's countermeasures were expected after its commerce ministry flagged "necessary steps" against the EU move late last month. "Regrettably, despite China's goodwill and sincerity, the EU has insisted on going its own way, taking restrictive measures and building new protectionist barriers," the commerce ministry said in a separate statement on Sunday. "Therefore, China has no choice but to adopt reciprocal restrictive measures." The EU delegation office in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China will also restrict imports of medical devices from other countries that contain EU-made components worth more than 50% of the contract value, the finance ministry said. The commerce ministry said products from European companies in China were not affected. The world's second- and third-largest economies are due to hold a leaders' summit in China later in July. On Friday, China also announced duties of up to 34.9% for five years on brandy originating in the European Union, most of it cognac from France, after concluding an investigation largely believed to be a response to Europe's EV tariffs. Major cognac producers Pernod Ricard, LVMH and Remy Cointreau were spared from the levies, however, provided they sell at a minimum price, which China has not disclosed.
