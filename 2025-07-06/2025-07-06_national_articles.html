                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This image provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows Tropical Storm Chantal as it moves from South Carolina into central North Carolina on Sunday, July 6, 2025. MIAMI (AP) — Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a depression Sunday but raised concerns of possible flash flooding as it makes its way into central and eastern North Carolina. Chantal made landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, at about 4 a.m. EDT Sunday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. At 11 a.m., it was located about 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of Wilmington, North Carolina, and was moving north at 9 mph (14 kph) with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (56 kph). The system was expected to turn to the northeast late Sunday as it weakens further. The hurricane center canceled tropical storm warnings for portions of the two Carolinas. But heavy rain was forecast for parts of North Carolina through Monday, with total rainfall of 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) and local amounts up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) that could lead to flash flooding. Forecasters said dangerous surf and rip currents at beaches from northeastern Florida to the mid-Atlantic states are expected to last for the next couple of days. South Carolina's Emergency Management division had warned residents earlier of the possibility of isolated tornadoes along the coast and of minor coastal flooding. It also warned drivers not to venture on water-covered roads or around road-closure signs where flooding occurred.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A helicopter flies over the Guadalupe River after a flash flood swept through the area, Friday, July 4, 2025, in Kerrville, Texas. The monstrous, swift-moving flood that swept through the Hill Country of Texas on Friday, killing at least 67 people and leaving many more missing, was a flash flood, the nation's top storm-related killer. Among those missing are girls attending a summer camp. Authorities said about 850 people had been rescued, including some by helicopter. According to the National Weather Service, a flash flood is flooding that begins within six hours, and often in as little as three hours, of heavy rainfall. Waters rise so quickly that people are caught off guard, according to the weather service. If at home or work, the water can rise so quickly that people are trapped before they have time to think about escape. Fast-moving waters along the river rose 26 feet (8 meters) in just 45 minutes before dawn Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as more heavy rains were expected Saturday, and flash flood warnings and flood watches remained in effect for parts of central Texas. On Thursday afternoon, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch, estimating rising water of up to 7 inches (17 centimeters) in spots. A “watch” means conditions are favorable for a flood and people should be prepared, but hazardous conditions might not develop. Dan Patrick said the potential for heavy rain and flooding covered a large area, and “everything was done to give them a heads-up that you could have heavy rain.” However, when asked about how people were notified in Kerr County so that they could get to safety, Judge Rob Kelly, the county's chief elected official, said: “We do not have a warning system.” When reporters pushed on why more precautions weren't taken, Kelly responded: “Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming.” Last year, 145 people died in flash floods, according to the weather service. On average over the past 30 years, floods have claimed 127 lives annually. Nearly half of all flood-related fatalities involve vehicles. Many people don't realize that a car becomes difficult to control in just 6 inches (15 centimeters) of water and can be swept away in as little as 18 inches (46 centimeters). So instead of finding a detour, too often people try to drive through water at underpasses or other low-lying areas. It can happen anywhere, according to the weather service, which says that “the normally tranquil streams and creeks in your neighborhood can become raging torrents if heavy rain falls overhead.” An area can be flooded even without rain — if it's downstream of a torrential rainstorm and a swollen stream heads its way. Hurricanes, tropical storms, non-cyclonic weather systems carrying heavy rain and dam failures are some weather events that can cause flash flooding.</p>

Ambassador to NATO Matt Whitaker joins 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss the concern with Iranian sleeper cells and the latest on the war in Ukraine as President Donald Trump continues to advocate for peace. Ambassador to NATO Matt Whitaker argued Iran is at a "decision point" following its war with Israel and U.S. airstrikes on its nuclear program — all while U.S. officials remain on high alert for sleeper cell concerns. Whitaker urged Iran to seek peace during "Sunday Morning Futures," while noting that the U.S. is still dealing with the implications of an open border – and the national security implications of it – from the Biden administration. "It's obviously a very dangerous world, Jason," Whitaker told Fox News' Jason Chaffetz on Sunday. "I think… President Trump, as a peacemaker, has made it safer, but at the same time, we're still dealing with a lot of the consequences of four years of Joe Biden, including a porous border, where not only did we have, as Tom Homan points out, over 1,200 Iranian nationals that came into our country that we know of, but you had over a million known gotaways that we have no idea who they are, where they went, and that's a real challenge." "But, at the same time, you know, President Trump has been very clear about his policy towards Iran, that they cannot have a nuclear weapon," he added. They should move forward and seek peace." Over 1,500 Iranian nationals who illegally entered the U.S. at the southern border were arrested during the Biden administration, and nearly 50% of them were released back into the country, according to a senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) source last month. Meanwhile, just hours after Trump addressed the nation about U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, DHS released a new memo sounding the alarm on a "heightened threat environment in the United States." The bulletin from the National Terrorism Advisory System did not cite any specific threats but comes as Iranian officials have threatened retaliation. "It is our duty to keep the nation safe and informed, especially during times of conflict," the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to Fox News Digital. Whitaker argued the growing threat of possible Iranian sleeper cell activity in the United States puts tremendous pressure on law enforcement to be right "100 percent of the time." "Iran should come to the table and should sue for peace, and should make a peace deal with the United States, with Israel, and just say, ‘No more. We want to be in the world where people seek prosperity and a bright future for their citizens,'" he said. "So, Jason… right now, this puts a lot of pressure on our law enforcement, puts a lot of pressure on… DOJ and the FBI to be right 100 percent of the time and seek out these sleeper cells and to make sure that they can't activate," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Participants perform during the Estonian Song and Dance Celebration “Iseoma” at the Kalev Stadium in Tallinn, Estonia, Friday, July 4, 2025. The Song Festival Grounds, a massive outdoor venue in the Estonian capital Tallinn, was filled with spectators Saturday evening despite the downpour, and absolutely packed on Sunday, with even more people attending. The traditional Song and Dance Celebration, which decades ago inspired resistance to Soviet control and was later recognized by the U.N.'s cultural agency, attracted tens of thousands of performers and spectators alike, many in national costume. This year, tickets to the main event -– a seven-hour concert on Sunday featuring choirs of all ages -– sold out weeks in advance. Participants perform during the Estonian Song and Dance Celebration “Iseoma” at the Kalev Stadium in Tallinn, Estonia, Friday, July 4, 2025. “We want to feel as one today more than six years ago (when the celebration was last held), and we want to feel that we are part of Estonia,” Puur told The Associated Press on Friday. The theme of the song festival this year is dialects and regional languages, and the repertoire is a mix of folk songs, well-known patriotic anthems that are traditionally sung at these celebrations and new pieces written specifically for the occasion. The festival's artistic director, Heli Jürgenson, says that although the audience won't know all the songs -– especially those sung in dialects -– there will be many opportunities to sing along. The main concert on Sunday night will end with a song called “My Fatherland is My Love” –- a patriotic song Estonians spontaneously sang at the 1960 festival in protest against the Soviet regime. Every song celebration since 1965 has concluded with this anthem in what both performers and spectators describe as the highest emotional point of the whole event. An emotional Jürgenson, who this year will conduct a combined choir of about 19,000 people singing it, said: “This is a very special moment.” She believes that what drove the tradition more than 150 years ago still drives it today. “There have been different turning points, there have been a lot of historical twists, but the need for singing, songs and people have remained the same,” she said. It heralded a period of national awakening for Estonians, when Estonian-language press, theater and other things emerged, says Elo-Hanna Seljamaa, associate professor at the University of Tartu. The Soviet rulers were into “mass spectacles of all kinds, so in a way it was very logical for the Soviet regime to tap into this tradition and to try to co-opt it,” Seljamaa said in an interview. Estonians had to sing Soviet propaganda songs in Russian during that time, but they were also able to sing their own songs in their own language, which was both an act of defiance and an act of therapy for them, she said. During the Singing Revolution, 2 million people in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania joined hands to form a 600-kilometer (370-mile) human chain that protested Soviet occupation of the Baltics with a song. In 2003, the United Nations' cultural body, UNESCO, recognized Estonia's folk song festival and similar events in Latvia and Lithuania for showcasing the “intangible cultural heritage of humanity.” This year she traveled to Tallinn from Luxembourg, where she currently lives, to take part in the Song and Dance Celebration as a choir singer –- her longtime hobby. The Singing Revolution is a time “when we sang ourselves free,” she told AP. Seljamaa says the song and dance celebration may have suffered a drop in popularity in the 1990s, a somewhat difficult time for Estonia as it was emerging as an independent country after the Soviet Union collapsed, but has since bounced back. There is a tremendous interest in it among young people, she says, and always more performers willing to take part than the venue can fit in, and there are people who had left Estonia to live abroad, but travel back to take part. She is part of the European Choir of Estonians – a singing group that unites Estonians from more than a dozen countries. This year's four-day celebration, which started on Thursday, included several stadium dancing performances by over 10,000 dancers from all around the country and a folk music instrument concert. That was preceded by a large procession, in which all participants -– singers, dancers, musicians, clad in traditional costumes and waving Estonian flags –- marched from the city center to the Song Festival Grounds by the Baltic Sea. It's a mix of men, women and children, with participants aged from six to 93. For most, singing and dancing is a hobby on top of their day jobs or studies. But to take part in the celebration, collectives had to go through a rigorous selection process, and months worth of rehearsals. For Karl Kesküla, an electrical engineer from Estonia's western island of Saaremaa, this is the first time taking part in the song celebration as a singer -– but he attended it before as a spectator. “I got the feeling that what they did was really special and almost, like, every person you meet has gone to it or been a part of it at least once. Participants described the celebrations as being an important part of their national identity. If it's hard, we sing together and that brings everything back together and then we forget our troubles,” singer Piret Jakobson said. “It's really good with all Estonian people to do the same thing,” said engineer Taavi Pentma, who took part in the dance performances. Among them is Kaja Kriis, who traveled from Germany, where she's been living for the last 25 years. “Estonia is my home,” she said, adding that it's important for her “to be together with my friends, to keep my Estonian language, to maintain the Estonian language and Estonian culture.”</p>

Greg Abbott, R-Texas, has declared a 'Day of Prayer' after flash floods devastate the state as the death toll and missing persons list rises. At least 59 people, including 21 children, have been confirmed dead from the flash floods along the Guadalupe River that began Friday. Eleven children and one counselor remain missing from a girls' summer camp near the river, which flooded due to the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry. "It only took 9 days for Trump's cuts to the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] to kill dozens of children in Texas when Tropical Storm Barry landed this week," Grant Stern, the executive editor of Occupy Democrats, wrote on X. "The people in Texas voted for government services controlled by Donald Trump and Greg Abbott," added Ron Filipkowski, former federal prosecutor and the editor-in-chief of MediasTouchNews. "What has happened to the girls at Camp Mystic is EXACTLY what one of the country's best meteorologists, John Morales, warned would happen," added Rachel Bitecofer, assistant director at Christopher Newport University's Wason Center for Public Policy. "Trump's cuts to the NOAA & NWS have critically impacted storm prediction nationwide." Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem held a press conference Saturday, and acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding the nation's flood notification systems, which included concerns that weather forecasts underestimated the amount of rain that ultimately fell. Noem noted that the Trump administration is "currently upgrading" the nation's flood notification technology, which she described as "ancient." "It was much more water, much like [what] we experienced during [Hurricane] Harvey, with the same type of system that was unpredictable in the way that it reacted in the way that it stopped right here and dumped unprecedented amounts of rain that caused a flooding event like this." Tom Fahy, legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, told NBC News that weather forecasting offices were adequately staffed, and "they issued timely forecasts and warnings leading up to the storm," but he added that unfilled leadership positions were "clearly a concern." The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for Kerr County more than 12 hours ahead of the catastrophic flood. A flash flood warning was issued for Hunt & Ingram 3 HOURS before the Guadalupe started to climb," said Texas-based meteorologist Avery Tomasco. The same sentiment was echoed by other meteorological experts as well. Greg Abbott discuss the ongoing efforts after flooding along the Guadalupe River during a news conference in Ingram, Texas, on Saturday. "The reason Trump defunded the National Weather Service leading to the deaths of all those girls in the Texas flood is because PROJECT 2025 THOUGHT WEATHER PREDICTION SCIENCE WAS TIED TO EVIDENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE," musician Mikel Jollett wrote on X. Isaiah Martin, a Democratic candidate for Texas's 18th Congressional District, called for an immediate congressional investigation into "the Republican DOGE cuts to NOAA and the National Weather Service." "We saw the affects (sic) this weekend," Martin wrote on X. "Trump defunded these agencies and we DEMAND answers. The result was predictable: A bad forecast leading to the death of children in a horrific flood," added California state Senator Scott Wiener. Severe flooding was reported Friday in Kerr County, Texas. Jay Inslee did not directly blame Trump's approach to climate change for the deaths, but he suggested the president's efforts to peel back green energy funding are a contributing factor to increased catastrophic natural disasters, like this weekend's flood in Texas. "It is hard to make the Texas flood tragedy worse, except to know that on the same day Trump signed a bill cratering solar and wind energy that is vital in the battle against the climate change making these torrential rains more frequent," Inslee wrote on X this weekend. During an interview with CNN, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, added that he didn't think it was helpful to have open leadership positions that, if filled, could "help prevent these strategies." "I don't think it's helpful to have missing key personnel from the National Weather Service not in place to help prevent these tragedies," Castro said, adding "we have to figure out in the future how we make sure that it doesn't happen again." White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson called it "shameful and disgusting" to see that in the wake of this tragedy people are politicizing what took place. ﻿"It's shameful and disgusting that in the wake of tragedy, the left's first instinct is to lie and politicize a disaster to target their political opponents. False claims about the NWS have been repeatedly debunked by meteorologists, experts, and other public reporting," Jackson said. "The NWS did their job, even issuing a flood watch more than 12 hours in advance. The Trump Administration is grateful to the first responders who sprung into action to save hundreds lives during this catastrophe, and will continue to help the great state of Texas in their recovery efforts."

Greg Abbott, R-Texas, has declared a 'Day of Prayer' after flash floods devastate the state as the death toll and missing persons list rises. A Republican lawmaker said he was reunited with his two daughters who were attending a Christian summer camp that was destroyed when deadly flooding swept through Central Texas over the weekend. Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, said his two daughters were evacuated from Camp Mystic, a camp along the banks of the Guadalupe River in Hunt, Texas. "Camille, Vivian and I are now reunited with Caroline and Juliana who were evacuated from Camp Mystic," Pfluger said of his family. "The last day has brought unimaginable grief to many families and we mourn with them as well as holding out hope for survivors." As of Sunday morning, five young girls who were staying at Camp Mystic have been confirmed dead. Kerr County officials confirmed 27 campers were still missing about 36 hours after the flood.

"The camp was completely destroyed," 13-year-old Elinor Lester, one of hundreds of campers, told the Associated Press. "A helicopter landed and started taking people away. Greg Abbott has vowed that rescuers "won't stop until we find every girl who was in those cabins" at Camp Mystic. In a separate post, Pfluger praised the heroism of camp counselors and others who acted to save lives during the height of the flooding. "There are countless heroes who acted so bravely during this tragic situation – who sacrificed for others – thank you… and for most of you we will never even know the stories or understand what you did! Pfluger said Camp Mystic's co-owner, Dick Eastland, sacrificed his life to save the girls attending the camp. "Camp Mystic's Dick Eastland no doubt gave his life attempting to save his campers," Pfluger wrote in a third post.. "For decades he and his wife Tweety poured his life into loving and developing girls and women of character. Crews work to clear debris from the Cade Loop bridge along the Guadalupe River on Saturday, July 5, 2025, in Ingram, Texas. The flooding in Kerr County killed at least 59 people, including 21 children. Officials confirmed at least another eight people died in nearby counties. Other stories of heroism have begun to surface as the floodwaters recede in Texas. Jeff Landry praised Emma Foltz, a resident of Alexandria, Louisiana, and a senior at Louisiana Tech University, who has worked as a camp counselor at Camp Mystic in Texas for three years.

"She played an instrumental role in helping evacuate 14 of her campers to safety," Landry wrote in a Facebook post. "Please join me in thanking Emma for all her hard work and bravery under immense pressure." Elsewhere in Kerr County, a family helped save a woman's life after she was swept 20 miles downriver and clung to a tree for hours in the deadly flash flooding. Pfluger asked the public to "pray for miracles" as crews continue searching for survivors of the floods, including 11 young girls and one counselor missing from Camp Mystic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Search widens: Authorities are still racing to find victims of yesterday's flash flooding in central Texas, including 27 people from Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp in Kerr County. Greg Abbott said the state's focus remains on a “relentless” search for survivors as floodwaters recede in some areas. • Rising death toll: At least 50 people, including 15 children, have died in the flooding, according to local officials. The families of four campers have confirmed their deaths to CNN, while others are enduring an excruciating wait for news on their children. • Federal response: The Trump administration will honor a federal disaster declaration signed by Abbott to help direct relief to Texas, after the president denied some other requests this year and has sought to shift the burden of disaster response onto states. • For ways to help those affected by floods in central Texas, visit CNN Impact Your World. Families are holding out hope that their loved ones are found safe after they went missing at an RV park in Kerrville, Texas, when devastating floods hit the area. Several people were reported missing from HTR TX Hill Country Campground as a number of campsites in central Texas were engulfed in floodwaters. Allison Edwards said her dad Steve Edwards was also last seen at the campground in the early morning on July 4, around the same time a flash flood emergency warning was issued in Kerr County. “He is the best father, son, friend, and dog dad who never met a stranger,” Allison Edwards said. “He would give you the shirt off his back. “My papa (Melissa's dad) mentioned that they might have tried to evacuate before the storm hit,” Carr said. At least four people have died in Travis County, Texas, after catastrophic flooding inundated parts of the area, authorities said Saturday night. Greg Abbott on Saturday signed an expanded disaster declaration, including Travis County. The Travis County Office of Emergency Management continues to conduct search and rescue operations amid devastating flooding, Brown said. Three people are dead and two are still missing in Burnet County, Texas, Saturday after torrential rainfall caused substantial flooding, county Emergency Management Coordinator Derek Marchio told CNN. The county has suffered damage to major roadways and bridges, Marchio said. Greg Abbott signed an expanded disaster declaration to include Burnet and five other counties. The deaths reported in Burnet County bring the death toll up to 46, with 43 fatalities reported about 114 miles away in Kerr County. The woman, who was on a camping trip with her family on the Guadalupe River, was swept away by floodwaters and separated from her family, Jeter told CNN. She was in the water for about four hours – stuck under debris-ridden water and passing several dams and a road – before pulling herself onto a tree many miles away from the campsite. “I'm gonna get help,” Jeter told the woman who he spotted from his deck. Thirty minutes later, authorities still hadn't arrived, so Jeter got in his car and flagged down a Department of Public Safety officer in the area. After Jeter helped rescue the woman, she waited at his home for a few hours until a family member picked her up and took her to the hospital. The father of Blair, 13, and Brooke Harber, 11 has confirmed to CNN his daughters have died. Blair and Brooke, pictured left to right, went missing during the catastrophic flooding in Kerr County, Texas. Neither girl was attending Camp Mystic at the time of their disappearance. “Our primary focus is on search and rescue of every single person involved, and we'll continue through the night to make sure that happens.” He added authorities were recovering and identifying bodies Saturday. “We knew today was going to be that day, so our numbers are going to constantly be changing,” he said. There are still 27 children missing from Camp Mystic, Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said at a Saturday news conference, as officials rescue people from campsites after the Guadalupe River surged Friday. “We've been rescuing people out of these camps by the hundreds all day,” Rice said. The private Christian summer camp is nestled near the Guadalupe River, which rose more than 20 feet in less than two hours during torrential rains Friday that triggered flash flooding in parts of Texas. Rice said the holiday weekend complicates counting missing people outside of the total missing from Camp Mystic, so officials won't be providing that number. “Campers are coming in for Fourth of July weekend, people are camped along the river bank, people are coming in to visit – there's a number that we just don't know yet,” he said. At least 43 people died in Kerr County, Texas, after severe flooding hit the state, according to Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha. The fatalities include 28 adults and 15 children, Leitha said at a news conference Saturday. The sheriff added five children and 12 adults have yet to be identified. “We knew today was going to be that day, so our numbers are going to constantly be changing,” Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said. Authorities will provide updates on the state's response to severe flooding impacting parts of Texas as search and rescue efforts continue. The official death toll has risen further following catastrophic flooding in parts of central Texas. At least 32 people, including 14 children, have died, according to local officials. A US Congressman says his two daughters were evacuated from Camp Mystic, the hard-hit summer camp for girls in Hunt, Texas, where more than 20 campers are still missing. Rep. August Pfluger announced he and his wife were “now reunited” with their daughters in a post on X Saturday. “The last day has brought unimaginable grief to many families and we mourn with them as well as holding out hope for survivors,” he wrote. “Please join us today as we pray for miracles,” he added. CNN's Ed Lavandera got a firsthand look at the destruction from flooding at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas, where the Guadalupe River rose more than 20 feet in less than two hours during torrential rains that triggered flash flooding in parts of the state yesterday. More than 20 campers remain unaccounted for after the disaster. Renee Smajstrla, the 8-year-old Camp Mystic camper who went missing during the torrential flooding in Kerr County, Texas, has passed away, her family confirmed to CNN. “It's truly devastating,” Shawn Salta, Smajstrla's uncle, told CNN. “When President Trump took office…he said he wanted to fix, and is currently upgrading the technology. The president's Fiscal Year 2026 budget, which the administration is already abiding by, does make cuts and even closes some weather research labs that are vital to forecast improvement. As CNN has previously reported, the NWS issued a flood watch early Thursday afternoon that highlighted Kerr County as a place at high risk of flash flooding through the overnight. A more dire flash flood emergency warning was then issued for Kerr County at 4:03 a.m. CT, followed by another one for Kerrville at 5:34 a.m. CT. Correction: This post has been updated to reflect that Trump's fiscal year budget is what affects the National Weather Service. As flood waters recede in central Texas, ground crews are able to uncover and search additional areas, Texas Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said. You have assets in the air that are still doing searches. You have boats that are in the water doing searches. And you have ground crews doing searches,” Kidd said. Dogs are also assisting in searching banks where people may be missing, Kidd said. At least 32 people, including 14 children, are dead following torrential rains and flooding in Texas, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said at a Saturday news conference. Greg Abbott underscored the urgent focus on finding survivors of the devastating floods during a press conference Saturday, and said he is directing all state agencies involved to prioritize lifesaving operations. “And there's a need for speed, not just every hour, every minute counts, which is why there's people in the air, people in the water, people on the ground right now, because they're looking to save every last life.” “History would tell us that after a certain time period, those chances (of survival) diminish,” Kidd said. “Our hope and prayer is that there are still people alive that are out there, and we're still actively searching for them.” US Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said state officials are “far from having finished the job” of search, rescue and recovery after deadly floods hit the state. Authorities say more than 20 girls are still unaccounted for at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas. Roy noted the “heroic efforts of people that worked in those camps, directors of the camps, people who own the camps, who not just risk their lives, gave their lives to try to go save the lives of those kids, that's who they are as Texans.” “We, just at the request of a previous conversation less than an hour ago … requested more fixed-wing aircraft from the Coast Guard to come and help us,” Noem said. She added many of the aircraft will be equipped with thermal imaging to allow round-the-clock searches. “Some of the assets that other agencies may offer don't have that kind of equipment but the Coast Guard does have it so that will be deployed so that the search and rescue efforts don't stop even when it does get dark at night.” She reassured Texans FEMA would remain fully engaged and ready to provide additional assistance based on evolving needs from state leadership. “We'll continue to stay engaged, and I'll be here,” Noem said, noting her plans to visit Camp Mystic, where more than 20 girls are still unaccounted for, along with other parts of the community to assess damage and offer support. “The number one priority now is people,” Noem stated. While damage assessments to infrastructure are ongoing as bridges, roads and power lines have all sustained impact, she said the focus remains on saving lives before turning fully to long-term recovery. “The state of Texas is amazing in how it responds to disasters,” she said. “You are an example to the nation of getting through these difficult times.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has faced various legal setbacks early in his second term which have been exacerbated through court shopping by his opponents, but a recent Supreme Court decision could help offer some relief. The tactic involves parties suing the administration to file their lawsuits in a federal judicial district with a heavily liberal bench of judges. In the District of Columbia, there are only four Trump-appointed judges, while the rest of the bench is dominated by appointees of former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Bill Clinton, while the District of Maryland only has one Trump appointee and a bench similarly stacked with Democrat-appointed judges. Zack Smith, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Florida and Senior Legal Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, believes liberal groups and opponents suing Trump have been “strategic in where they filed their lawsuits.” “Many of these lawsuits are being filed in places like California, Washington State, New York, Boston, other courts around the country where I suspect litigants are more likely to get a favorable with those challenging these policies, expect to get a more favorable judge who might be more inclined to rule in their favor,” Smith told the Washington Examiner. “Nearly every fact relevant to this dispute occurred in the Central District of California, and the consequences of the final judgment entered in this case will be felt by those who live in that district. But Plaintiffs nonetheless chose to sue in San Francisco, which has emerged as a favorite forum for those challenging this administration's policies,” the DOJ argued in a June 25 filing. A major issue with court shopping is that groups and persons bringing lawsuits are inclined to bring them in venues they believe can hear the case and may be favorable for their desired outcome. While conservatives and Trump allies have raged over court shopping early into his term, as John Shu, a constitutional law scholar who served in both Bush administrations, noted to the Washington Examiner, that “sometimes, but not as often, conservatives are guilty of the same” tactics. “There's plenty of hypocrisy to go around on both sides,” Shu said. During the Biden administration, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas became a popular place for conservative groups to file lawsuits, hoping to have Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, assigned to their case. “So [the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine] sued there, and obviously they got their nationwide injunction on mifepristone. They eventually lost at the Supreme Court on standing, but they still managed to get their district court nationwide injunction,” Shu added. “When they did that all the liberals were upset about nationwide injunctions.” Georgetown University Law professor Stephen Vladeck, writing for the New York Times in 2023, that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had “made the loophole into an art form” with getting his cases before Kacsmaryk. Justice Elena Kagan, a part of the liberal wing of the high court, expressed her concern over forum shopping and district courts issuing universal injunctions to halt presidential or congressional actions during a talk at Northwestern University's law school in 2022. “It just can't be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks, and leave it stopped for the years that it takes to go through normal process,” Kagan said, lamenting how people “forum shop” which district court they file in. When Trump returned to power in January, and the flurry of cases were filed against Trump in liberal judicial districts, much of the uproar from the legal left-wing over forum shopping has quitted, as some legal scholars argue it has become a more prevalent problem in the past 6 months. “There's a particular focus on several lawsuits that were filed during the Biden administration in Texas, in front of Judge Kacsmaryk, there's a lot of anger and frustration expressed by many on the left because of that,” Smith said, while noting where liberal groups have filed lawsuits during the second Trump term. Shu noted how liberal groups are more aggressive with the tactic of court shopping, but that the significant number of liberal courts where those groups can file also exacerbates it. “It's really out of hand, and in the past, both conservative and liberals have gone forum shopping, court shopping, but the liberals are super aggressive about it, and I think it's because they have more judges,” Shu told the Washington Examiner. The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in Trump v. CASA that universal injunctions, blocking laws or policies from being enforced against anyone, “likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to federal courts.” The ruling, in a case which originated out of a trio of universal injunctions against Trump's birthright citizenship order, has taken a key power out of district courts' hands. Shu also agreed that the decision in Trump v. CASA is a positive development, but with other avenues for sweeping relief, including class action lawsuits, court shopping may still persist in the legal battles against the Trump administration. “I think it's a good thing that the Supreme Court ruled the way it did on nationwide injunctions, and I hope we will see a reduction in forum shopping and court shopping,” Shu said. “Only time will tell,” Shu added, “but I certainly hope it happens.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least 43 people, including 15 children, died in Kerr County after a storm unleashed nearly a foot (0.3 meters) of rain on Friday and sent floodwaters gushing out of the Guadalupe River through the hilly region known for its century-old summer camps. A Texas sheriff says the deaths from flash flooding in central Texas has risen to 27 people, including nine children.

A Texas Department of Public Safety official, bottom left, combs through the banks of the Guadalupe River near Camp Mystic after a flash flood swept through the area Saturday, July 5, 2025, in Hunt, Texas. KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) — Rescuers scoured a devastated central Texas landscape of mangled trees, overturned cars and muck-filled debris Saturday in an increasingly bleak mission to locate survivors, including 27 girls who have not been seen since their camp was slammed with a wall of water in a historic flash flood. The flooding in Kerr County killed at least 43 people, including 15 children, and at least eight people died in nearby counties. Authorities still have not said how many people were missing beyond the children from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along a river in Kerr County where most of the dead were recovered. The destructive, fast-moving waters rose 26 feet (8 meters) on the Guadalupe River in just 45 minutes before daybreak Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as rains continued pounding communities outside San Antonio on Saturday and flash flood warnings and watches remained in effect. Greg Abbott vowed that authorities will work around the clock and said new areas were being searched as the water receded. He declared Sunday a day of prayer for the state. “I urge every Texan to join me in prayer this Sunday — for the lives lost, for those still missing, for the recovery of our communities, and for the safety of those on the front lines,” he said in a statement. Authorities were coming under scrutiny over whether the camps and residents in places long vulnerable to flooding received proper warning and whether enough preparations were made. The area is especially popular around the July Fourth holiday, making it more difficult to know how many are missing. “We don't even want to begin to estimate at this time,” Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said earlier. People react as they inspect an area outside sleeping quarters at Camp Mystic along the banks of the Guadalupe River after a flash flood swept through the area Sunday, July 6, 2025, in Hunt, Texas. “A helicopter landed and started taking people away. The raging storm, fueled by incredible amounts of moisture, woke up her cabin just after midnight Friday. When rescuers arrived, they tied a rope for the girls to hold as they walked across a bridge with water whipping around their legs, she said. Among those confirmed dead were an 8-year-old girl from Mountain Brook, Alabama, who was at Camp Mystic, and the director of another camp just up the road. AccuWeather said the private forecasting company and the National Weather Service sent warnings about potential flash flooding hours beforehand. “These warnings should have provided officials with ample time to evacuate camps such as Camp Mystic and get people to safety,” AccuWeather said in a statement. At the Mo-Ranch Camp in the community of Hunt, officials had been monitoring the weather and opted to move several hundred campers and attendees at a church youth conference to higher ground. At nearby Camps Rio Vista and Sierra Vista, organizers also had mentioned on social media that they were watching the weather the day before wrapping up their second summer session Thursday. Authorities and elected officials have said they did not expect such an intense downpour, the equivalent of months' worth of rain for the area. U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, whose district includes the ravaged area, called it a once-in-a-century flood and acknowledged that there would be second-guessing and finger-pointing as people look for someone to blame. Search crews were facing harsh conditions while “looking in every possible location,” Rice said. Officials said more than 850 people had been rescued in the last 36 hours and there were heroic efforts at the camps to save children. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem arrived and pledged that the Trump administration would use all available resources. Coast Guard helicopters and planes were assisting to ensure operations can continue even in darkness. Greg Abbott, discuss the ongoing efforts for recent flooding along the Guadalupe River during a news conference in Ingram, Texas, on Saturday, July 5, 2025, as Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief, Nim Kidd, left, looks on. One reunification center at an elementary school was mostly quiet after taking in hundreds of evacuees the day before. “We still have people coming here looking for their loved ones. We've had a little success, but not much,” said Bobby Templeton, superintendent of Ingram Independent School District. Just 20 minutes later, water was pouring into her home, she said. She described an agonizing hour clinging to a tree with her teen son. He was lost for a while, but we found them,” she said. “I was having to look at my grandson in the face and tell him everything was going to be OK, but inside I was scared to death,” he said. Locals know the place as “ flash flood alley.” People comfort each other outside the Butt-Holdsworth Memorial Library in Kerville after heavy rainfall caused the Guadalupe River to flood and damage several communities in Central Texas, Saturday, July 5, 2025. The weekend forecast had called for rain, with a flood watch upgraded to a warning overnight Friday for at least 30,000 people. It's getting time now for the recovery,” he said. “And that's going to be a long, toilsome task for us.” Crews work to clear debris from the Cade Loop bridge along the Guadalupe River on Saturday, July 5, 2025, in Ingram, Texas.</p>

KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) — Before heading to bed before the Fourth of July holiday, Christopher Flowers checked the weather while staying at a friend's house along the Guadalupe River. Hours later, he was rushing to safety: He woke up in darkness to electrical sockets popping and ankle-deep water. Quickly, his family scrambled nine people into the attic. Phones buzzed with alerts, Flowers recalled Saturday, but he did not remember when in the chaos they started. “What they need is some kind of external system, like a tornado warning that tells people to get out now,” Flowers, 44, said. The destructive fast-moving waters that began before sunrise Friday in the Texas Hill Country killed at least 43 people in Kerr County, authorities said Saturday, and an unknown number of people remained missing. Those still unaccounted for included 27 girls from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along a river in Kerr County where most of the dead were recovered. But as authorities launch one of the largest search-and-rescue efforts in recent Texas history, they have come under intensifying scrutiny over preparations and why residents and youth summer camps that are dotted along the river were not alerted sooner or told to evacuate. The National Weather Service sent out a series of flash flood warnings in the early hours Friday before issuing flash flood emergencies — a rare alert notifying of imminent danger. “There's going to be a lot of finger-pointing, a lot of second-guessing and Monday morning quarterbacking,” said Republican U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, whose district includes Kerr County. An initial flood watch — which generally urges residents to be weather-aware — was issued by the local National Weather Service office at 1:18 p.m. Thursday. Weather messaging from the office, including automated alerts delivered to mobile phones to people in threatened areas, grew increasingly ominous in the early morning hours of Friday, urging people to move to higher ground and evacuate flood-prone areas, said Jason Runyen, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service office. At 4:03 a.m., the office issued an urgent warning that raised the potential of catastrophic damage and a severe threat to human life. Jonathan Porter, the chief meteorologist at AccuWeather, a private weather forecasting company that uses National Weather Service data, said it appeared evacuations and other proactive measures could have been undertaken to reduce the risk of fatalities. “People, businesses, and governments should take action based on Flash Flood Warnings that are issued, regardless of the rainfall amounts that have occurred or are forecast,” Porter said in a statement. Local officials have said they had not expected such an intense downpour that was the equivalent of months' worth of rain for the area. Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said he was jogging along the river early in the morning and didn't notice any problems at 4 a.m. A little over an hour later, at 5:20 a.m., the water level had risen dramatically and “we almost weren't able to get out of the park,” he said. Rice also noted that the public can become desensitized to too many weather warnings. He said he didn't know what kind of safety and evacuation plans the camps may have had. I don't know where the kids were,” he said. “I don't know what kind of alarm systems they had. Greg Abbott signs and holds up an disaster declaration proclamation as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, left, looks on during a press conference about recent flooding along the Guadalupe River, Saturday, July 5, 2025, in Kerrville, Texas. U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said Saturday it was difficult for forecasters to predict just how much rain would fall. She said the Trump administration would make it a priority to upgrade National Weather Service technology used to deliver warnings. “We know that everyone wants more warning time, and that's why we're working to upgrade the technology that's been neglected for far too long to make sure families have as much advance notice as possible,” Noem said during a press conference with state and federal leaders. The National Weather Service office in New Braunfels, which delivers forecasts for Austin, San Antonio and the surrounding areas, had extra staff on duty during the storms, Runyen said. Where the office would typically have two forecasters on duty during clear weather, they had up to five on staff. “There were extra people in here that night, and that's typical in every weather service office — you staff up for an event and bring people in on overtime and hold people over,” Runyen said.</p>

Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman reports on the arrests of two individuals in Los Angeles with alleged ties to a human smuggling hub on 'Fox Report.' An American national with credentials that read "CIA" has been arrested in Mexico on weapons charges, Mexican authorities said Saturday. Authorities found six firearms, magazines, live ammunition and tactical equipment, the agency said. Images posted by the security agency showed rifles, handguns, tactical vests, helmets, pocket knives and ammunition. The State Department told Fox News that it was aware of reports of the man's arrest. Mexican authorities released images of weapons, ammunition and equipment after an American with "CIA" credentials was arrested. An agency spokesperson said it has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens abroad.​​​​​'When a U.S. citizen is detained abroad, the department works to provide consular assistance," the spokesperson said.Mexican authorities have not disclosed any additional details about the man's arrest or why he was in the country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At around 8:30 p.m. Eastern time on July 4, a military plane carrying the eight migrants departed the U.S. military base in Djibouti, where they were held as the deportation effort was delayed by lower court stays and injunctions. The plane arrived in South Sudan less than four hours later, shortly before midnight on Friday, according to CBS News. The migrants' arrival in South Sudan came mere hours after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., issued an administrative stay on the deportation effort, barring DHS from “moving, transferring, or removing” the eight men while the court considered a new constitutional challenge to their removal. That new challenge was an emergency habeas petition, which argued that sending the men to the war-torn African nation would amount to unlawful punishment in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth amendments. Murphy ultimately denied the migrants' attorney's request for a temporary restraining order on their deportations to South Sudan, citing an earlier Supreme Court ruling. “This Court interprets these Supreme Court orders as binding on this new petition, as Petitioners are now raising substantially similar claims, and therefore Petitioners motion is denied,” Murphy said in the ruling. In late June, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to resume deporting criminal migrants to “third countries,” or places where they did not originate, including South Sudan. That included granting an emergency request from the DOJ to block a lower court ruling from Murphy that required the administration to give deportees a “meaningful opportunity” to raise fear-based claims before being sent to countries where they face torture or death. All of the eight migrants deported to South Sudan have been convicted of serious crimes in the United States. Only one of them is from South Sudan, while the others are from Vietnam, Mexico, Laos, Cuba, and Myanmar.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four months' worth of rain fell in just hours as water-laden thunderstorms stalled in place, giving rise to a wall of water that surged down the river in the blackness of night, limiting the number of people who could get the warnings and move to higher ground. But questions remain about how many people they reached, whether critical vacancies at the forecast offices could have affected warning dissemination, and if so-called warning fatigue had been growing among residents in a region described as one of the most dangerous in the country for flash flooding. The National Weather Service has been hard hit by personnel cuts under the Trump administration, but that may not have significantly affected the forecasts and warnings for this historic and deadly flooding. The two Texas NWS offices most closely involved in forecasting and warning about the flooding on the Guadalupe River — Austin-San Antonio and San Angelo — are missing some key staff members, but still issued a slew of watches and warnings about the flood danger. Tom Fahy, the legislative director for the NWS employees' union, told CNN that while he believes the offices had “adequate staffing and resources,” the Austin-San Antonio office is missing a warning coordination meteorologist — a role that serves as a crucial, direct link between forecasters and emergency managers. The National Weather Service began forecasting the threat of flooding in Kerr County as early as Thursday morning with a hazardous flood outlook. Several technical forecasts followed Thursday afternoon and evening with increasingly heightened language about the magnitude of the potential flooding. At 6:30 p.m., river forecasters were calling for locally intense rain rates that would “quickly overwhelm” the ground's ability to absorb the water. They also noted the potential for a historic rainfall event, though it's unclear if that messaging reached emergency managers. The first warning for “life-threatening flash flooding” for Kerrville came at 1:14 a.m., and was marked specifically to trigger the Emergency Alert System. It would have sounded the alarm on cell phones in the warned area, assuming those phones had service, and their users hadn't turned off EAS weather alerts. Several other critical alerts followed, warning of the imminent threat: A flash flood emergency warning was issued for Kerr County at 4:03 a.m., followed by one for Kerrville at 5:34 a.m. The raging river burst from its banks around 5 a.m., sweeping homes, cars, campers and cabins downstream. Several NWS offices around the country are worse off than San Angelo or Austin-San Antionio, working with such thin staffing that they no longer operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Many NWS forecast offices have ceased launching their twice-a-day weather balloons, which provide critical data that can alert forecasters to the potential for flooding and other hazardous weather. This particular population is inundated with weather watches and warnings all times of day and night; in Texas Hill Country, where flash flooding is triggered frequently by summertime thunderstorms, warning fatigue can settle in. The Kerr County tragedy also shines a spotlight on the limitations of current forecasting technology: It is simply not yet possible to predict that a cluster of thunderstorms dumping months' worth of rain would stall out over a specific spot. Research efforts to find answers to these forecasting questions could soon slip backwards, experts warn, if the Trump administration's 2026 budget proposal is enacted — just as the country needs to push the limits on what weather models are capable of. The budget seeks to eliminate all of NOAA's weather and climate research labs along with institutes jointly run with universities around the country. One of the NOAA labs slated to be shut down is the National Severe Storms Lab in Norman, Oklahoma, which works to improve flash flood forecasting among other hazards from severe thunderstorms. The NOAA research cuts would come just as human-caused climate change is resulting in more frequent and intense downpours like the ones that led to this tragedy in Texas. “Flash Flood Warnings were also issued on the night of July 3 and in the early morning of July 4, giving preliminary lead times of more than three hours before flash flooding conditions occurred.” While the July 4 flooding was worst-case, the scenario is becoming more frequent as the world warms: More rainfall coming faster than it ever has before, with forecast models inherently biased toward what we used to consider “normal.” For dozens of families, “normal” was shattered Thursday morning when they woke to torrential rain and catastrophic floodwaters that have since left at least 50 dead, including 15 children, according to local officials. As an intensive search continues for more than 20 girls in Kerr County, Texas, who remain unaccounted for after the historic flood swept dozens from a summer camp, local officials are adamant they could not have done anything more to prevent the tragedy. Greg Abbott praised federal and local officials in a long Saturday news conference and defended the response, calling it rapid in the face of a once-in-a-century flood. “Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming. We have floods all the time,” Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said at a Friday news conference. “There's going to be a lot of finger-pointing and a lot of second guessing and Monday morning quarterbacking,” said Texas Congressman Chip Roy. I understand why parents would be asking those questions, and all of the media.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the government response and the National Weather Service in a Saturday news conference. “Everybody knows that the weather is extremely difficult to predict, but also that the National Weather Service, over the years, at times, has done well, and at times, we have all wanted more time and more warning and more alerts and more notification,” Noem said. A NOAA official said they did not know specifically what Noem was referring to, but that upgrades to agency computer networks, radars and modeling systems are underway. Some of those upgrades have been taking place since before Trump took office for his second term.</p>
