                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Piastri had secured provisional pole during the first runs of Q3, the Australian made a mistake on his final effort and could not improve. The other papaya car of Lando Norris will start from third, the Briton also unable to better his previous time on his last flying lap. Hamilton's team mate Charles Leclerc claimed sixth, with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli taking seventh ahead of Ollie Bearman in eighth, though the Haas driver will start near the back of the field thanks to a 10-place grid penalty for a red flag infringement in third practice. Fernando Alonso put his Aston Martin in ninth place, while Pierre Gasly was an impressive 10th at the wheel of the Alpine. Also eliminated in the first segment of Qualifying – which saw the whole field barring Colapinto covered by just six-tenths – were Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson in 16th, the Kick Sauber duo of Gabriel Bortoleto and Nico Hulkenberg in 17th and 19th respectively and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll between them in 18th. After three busy practice sessions – each featuring a different driver at the top of the timesheets – it was time for Saturday's highly-anticipated Qualifying session. Russell clinched pole at home in 2024, but who would put themselves at the front of the grid this time around? Albon improved to climb up to third, while Verstappen and Piastri swapped fastest laps at the top of the timesheets. Elsewhere Hamilton and Leclerc looked to potentially be at risk in P11 and P13, with Hamilton told that he did not have enough fuel remaining for another lap. Others were not so lucky, however; Lawson exited in 16th, a contrast from his sixth place on the grid last time out in Austria. Colapinto aside, the entire field was covered by just six-tenths in an incredibly close Q1. After an initially quiet start, Verstappen led the field out as Q2 got underway at Silverstone. The Dutchman soon went fastest on a 1m 25.316s – before Piastri incredibly set the exact same time, going into P2 given that he set his time after Verstappen. Further back, Hamilton, Antonelli, Leclerc, Gasly and Tsunoda were the names at risk in the bottom five, all of whom had sported used tyres on their first runs. Alonso, meanwhile, was left unimpressed after encountering a slow-moving Antonelli, the two-time World Champion calling the incident “crazy” before suggesting that the Italian – who already has a three-place grid drop from his Lap 1 crash in Austria – would receive a penalty. As the segment entered its final minutes, everybody was back out on track in an effort to improve and get themselves into the top 10 shootout. The Scuderia cars bolted on fresh rubber for this run, enabling Leclerc to initially go fastest but Hamilton stormed to the head of the timesheets on a 1m 25.084s, just under five-hundredths clear of his team mate. Despite moving up to 10th, Tsunoda found himself pushed down the order as others bettered their times, dropping the Red Bull driver down to 12th. After an action-packed build-up, attentions turned to the top 10 shootout at Silverstone, with the Ferrari, McLaren and Mercedes duos joined by Verstappen, Alonso, Gasly and Bearman, though the latter would drop down the order thanks to a 10-place grid penalty from a red flag infringement in FP3. As the first laps went on the board, Piastri secured provisional pole position by pumping in a 1m 24.995s, while Hamilton proved to be his nearest challenger on a lap 0.135s adrift of the Australian. The other McLaren of Norris was third, with Verstappen and Leclerc following behind. Could Piastri hold on to score his fifth P1 grid slot of the year, or might Hamilton add a record eighth pole position at Silverstone to his name – and his first in general since the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix? Piastri looked to be improving, but a mistake on his lap meant that the Australian could not better his previous lap. The likes of Norris, Hamilton and Leclerc were also unable to make improvements – but Verstappen put together a sublime lap to grab pole position, the Red Bull man going quickest thanks to his effort of 1m 24.892s. This put him 0.103s clear of Piastri, while Norris had to settle for third. Russell moved up the order to take fourth, pushing Hamilton and Leclerc down to fifth and sixth respectively, while Antonelli claimed seventh, though the Italian will drop down three places after receiving a penalty last time out in Austria. Bearman slotted into eighth but, like Antonelli, will not keep his original position owing to a grid drop, the Haas driver moving down 10 places. "It was tricky out there with the wind," said Verstappen. "Throughout the whole of Qualifying it was shifting around a bit, and around here with these cars they are extremely sensitive to it. Just tried to tidy it up throughout Qualifying and that final lap was good enough. This is a proper track in Qualifying, where you have to go flat-out on all these corners, you have to be really committed and that's really enjoyable." The 2025 British Grand Prix is set to begin at 1500 local time on Sunday.</p>

Charles Leclerc topped the third and final practice session ahead of the British Grand Prix, which was disrupted by two red flags.

Charles Leclerc topped the third and final practice session ahead of the British Grand Prix, as the top three drivers were covered by less than one-tenth of a second.

The Ferrari driver posted a 1m 25.498s in much cooler conditions than Friday, which left him just 0.068s clear of Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen a further 0.019s back.

Drivers were unable to improve in the final moments at Silverstone following two red flags in quick succession, the first due to debris heading into Stowe that thwarted Lewis Hamilton's best effort as the Ferrari driver finished outside the top 10.

The second stoppage came at the very end of the one-hour session, Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto losing control through Maggotts and Becketts and finishing in the gravel with suspension damage, while Haas' Ollie Bearman hit the barrier on the entry to the pits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ollie Bearman has been hit with a grid penalty following a red flag infringement during third and final practice at Silverstone. Ollie Bearman has been handed a 10-place grid penalty for the British Grand Prix following a red flag infringement during the weekend's third and final practice hour. But there was worse to come for the Briton when a second red flag was thrown in the latter stages owing to Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto spinning off and becoming beached in the gravel. A document released following the stewards' hearing reads: “Car 87 had slowed down for the red flag and as he was approaching Turn 15 accelerated significantly to race pace and entered the pit entry road at 260kph. 37.6 (a) of the Formula One Sporting Regulations and Art. 2.5.4.1(b) of Appendix H of the International Sporting Code require that when a red flag is shown ‘all cars must immediately reduce speed and proceed slowly back to the pit lane'. “It is beyond doubt that the driver of Car 87 did not proceed slowly back to the pit lane when he accelerated to simulate entering into the pit entry road under race conditions. “In fact, we looked at a previous in-lap under normal racing conditions and found that he was faster in this lap, under a red flag. “While this may have been a factor contributing to the crash, we did not consider it to be a mitigating factor.” As well as the grid penalty, Bearman has also received four penalty points, bringing the total on his licence up to eight. The British driver is competing in his first home Grand Prix as an F1 driver, with last year's event at Silverstone being where the youngster's deal to race for Haas in 2025 was announced.</p>
