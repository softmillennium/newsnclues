                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup has been the source of much discussion, not all of which has been positive. On July 2, those interested in attending Chelsea's semifinal battle with Fluminense would have had to fork out an astonishing $473 (£346) for the cheapest standard admission ticket. For context, that's marginally more expensive than the cheapest Premier League season ticket at West Ham United for the 2024–25 season. There has been a sharp decline in recent days due to a lack of demand for the fixture, which takes place at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 8. It's worth noting that the match kicks off at 3 p.m. Prices have sharply declined and are now available for just 2.8% of their original standard admission price within the space of three days. It remains unclear whether those who have purchased more expensive tickets before price drops will be refunded. Tickets for the clash between Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid in the other semifinal are still commanding an enormous fee. As of Sunday afternoon, the cheapest available tickets are $195.15 (£142.91), but it's possible that prices drop before the match kicks off on July 9. FIFA have employed dynamic ticket pricing in conjunction with Ticketmaster for the 2025 Club World Cup, meaning prices change depending on demand. That can mean wild swings in costs for supporters and an unpredictable pricing structure. The average attendance at Club World Cup group stage matches was just over 35,000 and while that has resulted in certain venues reaching near full capacity, others have been alarmingly empty. FIFA have attempted to remedy this by reducing ticket prices as the tournament has progressed, especially for less desirable fixtures. Chelsea's win over Palmeiras and Fluminense's clash with Al Hilal in last Friday's quarterfinals were both available to view live for just $11 (£8.06).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seven months ago, U.S. soccer fans knew Diego Luna as the guy who broke his nose. Now he's the breakout star for the U.S. men's national team, and he is on the verge of a Gold Cup trophy against rivals Mexico. Diego Luna has gone from having a broken nose to being a breakout star for the U.S. men's team this year. Even before that injury in a game against Costa Rica back in January, it's been an eventful ride for the 21-year-old, recognizable by his platinum hair and his tattoos. He was recently voted an MLS All-Star for his club Real Salt Lake. Now, he's scoring goals and wowing USMNT fans, who'll hope the 5-foot-8 playmaker will stand out once again against Mexico in Sunday's grand finale in Houston (coverage begins at 6 p.m. Either way, Luna's big summer has put him in prime position to play his way onto the USMNT roster for the 2026 World Cup. I caught up with the electric playmaker about cheering for the U.S. over Mexico as a kid, his motivation, and if he plans to get another tattoo if he lifts the Gold Cup. When do you remember first becoming aware of the game? I think just being at a field with my older brother, and my dad was coaching. What's your first memory of the U.S.-Mexico rivalry? I know there's a story going around, but I just remember being at, like, a family gathering. Half of my family was rooting for Mexico. I just remember getting mad whenever Mexico would score. It was like a little beef between me and my family members, there'd be little comments. I don't remember which game it was. I think it was the one where Giovani dos Santos scored on a chip [for Mexico in the 2011 Gold Cup final]. You're from California, but you could have represented Mexico instead of the U.S. What was it like having both options? Yeah, they contacted me about playing for them when I was with the [U.S.] under-20s. But that was a long time ago now. Were you a fan of any particular team growing up? And my brother was a big Liverpool fan, so I also liked watching them. It's too bad I haven't gotten the chance to play against him in MLS yet. Germany star Marco Reus is a favorite of Diego Luna. Are you a fan of other sports teams? I do kind of like the Dallas Cowboys. It was very cool that we were able to use their locker room a few weeks ago [for the win over Haiti in the Gold Cup group stage]. Did you play other sports besides soccer as a kid? You might be surprised, but I played volleyball and basketball. Diego Luna may not stand over some his USMNT teammates, but he's been a standout player at this Gold Cup. You overlapped with Mexico defender Julian Araujo when you were at the Barcelona residency academy in Arizona. What would it be like to face him in the final? He's two years older than me, so we didn't really play together that much. But it's always good to see people you know succeed. OK, obviously I have to ask about your tats. Honestly, I don't even know. Do I count all the ones on my fingers separately? I know the first one you got to commemorate your niece's birthday. My son's name is on that same wrist, too, so that's also part of it. Diego Luna's signature celebration of kissing his tattoos to honor his family after scoring a goal. (Photo by Jeremy Olson/ISI Photos/ISI Photos via Getty Images) I don't know what exactly yet but yes. Who has been the most influential person in your life? He's always been there for me, and he made a lot of sacrifices for me. What has been the hardest moment of your career so far? Not making the Olympic team last year. It was a big disappointment in the moment but it kind of helped me in the end, you know? That setback helped get me to where I am today. What's your ultimate goal in soccer? I want to take care of my family, make sure they are secure, be able to secure their future financially. Right now, everything is about my son. He motivates me to keep pushing. Having a son has really put everything into perspective for me.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This particular Gold Cup roster came into camp with just an average of 16 caps. There were a lot of question marks entering the tournament as to whether this rather inexperienced USMNT squad was talented and capable enough to lift the Concacaf trophy in July. “We've dealt with a lot of adversity, but we've done it with a lot of heart,” defender Chris Richards said. “I think that's been the big thing this summer.” The summer didn't start easily with two losses to UEFA teams, Türkiye and Switzerland, in international friendlies in early June. “We're all eyes on Houston, and we want to win a whole trophy,” Richards said. The USA will face Mexico in the Gold Cup Final at NRG Stadium on July 6 (7 p.m. Fellow center back and veteran leader Tim Ream said that this opportunity wasn't just happenstance. It was an intentional effort to develop chemistry on and off the field. “What happens on the field doesn't just magically appear,” Ream said. Without all the togetherness, without fighting for each other, without standing shoulder to shoulder, without having each other's backs, we don't get to this point to be able to fight for that.” Now, the USMNT will face its biggest rival El Tri, for the eighth time in a Gold Cup Final. They came into the tournament feeling overlooked, and now hope to finish as champions. And so, now here we are.”</p>

Manager Enzo Maresca handed a debut to new recruit Joao Pedro during the 2-1 victory, following his immediate arrival in the States after finalising his transfer from Brighton. The Blues are set to face another Brazilian team, Fluminense, in the semi-finals on Tuesday night in New York, with at least £21.9million up for grabs should they secure a win. If Chelsea clinch the contentious competition, they could pocket around £90million - a significant sum that would alleviate concerns of any financial fair play violations amidst another summer of hefty spending in the transfer market. They've already acquired Liam Delap from Ipswich for £30million and completed a deal for Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund. "They never put pressure on me or the players in terms of we need to win this tournament because of the money." Chelsea began their FIFA Club World Cup journey with a guaranteed participation fee of around £25million, bolstered by an additional £3million from two group stage victories and £5.5million for advancing to the round of 16. Their triumph over Benfica netted them a further £9.7million, while defeating Palmeiras added another £15.5million to their earnings. Despite Manchester City's unexpected exit at the round of 16 against Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia, they still amassed over £40million in prize money, including the full participation award of £27.9million. FIFA Club World Cup prize money breakdown:. The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This isn't a midsummer UEFA Champions League either, with non-European challenger Fluminense up against a few of the modern era's usual suspects: Chelsea, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain. As we near the business end of this opulent summer spectacle, let's make one final projection of which remaining side is most likely to win the first expanded Club World Cup. Unlike our pre-tournament rankings that focused on the historical might of each team, this latest edition of Club World Cup power rankings is designed to live very much in the present. While you may have left the Round of 16 feeling less confident in Inter Miami's showing than Atlético Madrid, the La Liga side's elimination in a tough group capped its highest-possible ranking at 17th. Likewise, even a strong tournament from Bayern Munich until that chaotic and gruesome conclusion against PSG means it must slot in beneath your perceived weakest semifinalist. In this series finale, we'll look at the performances which have led each team to the doorstep of a lucrative tournament final. We'll also highlight one notable player — either a new addition who rapidly acclimated, a mainstay who carried his team through tough matchups or a rising prospect who may have set themselves up for more involvement in the league thanks to a standout display or two. Some of this was circumstantial given their draw: a relatively weak group saw Fluminense beat Ulsan HD 4-2 and notch scoreless draws against Borussia Dortmund and Mamelodi Sundowns. None of the results were nearly as eye-catching as, say, a win over PSG or Chelsea, but they finished second in Group F and fell into what became the thinner half of the bracket. A team can only beat the opposition in front of them, and so on. None of this is to call Fluminense's status as the final non-UEFA team in contention a fluke — far from it. Ageless goalkeeper Fabio has already logged five more appearances as he nears football immortality, and it isn't just stat-padding either. When weighted for shot volume faced, his goal prevention rate of 73.8 percent is third-best in the 32-team field, trailing only Thibaut Courtois and Gianluigi Donnarumma. Defensive midfielder Hércules leads the team with two goals, with six others having scored once apiece to propel their team through the tournament. Perhaps a date with Chelsea and its at-times overwhelmed defense can help him turn his effort into greater end product. In defense, no team has done better to limit their opponents' shooting threat with a field-best 0.072 xG per shot faced. Either way, Fluminense has done what every team from beyond Europe hoped to achieve: be the furthest-advancing “Rest of World” team. Their big-game presence has also been welcome from FIFA's perspective, ensuring the type of matchup variety that is frankly mandatory to sustain interest in a new tournament like this. In the aftermath of Chelsea's blown lead against Flamengo, which saw Nicolas Jackson sent off, the nature of the meltdown felt like an omen that Enzo Maresca's side couldn't be considered a tournament favorite. And yet, the club weathered that mid-group defeat to get back on track in time for knockout dates with Benfica and Palmeiras. Only one player in this tournament has attempted more shots than Cole Palmer (16), yet the England international has just one goal to show for those efforts. Palmer seems to be forcing it at times, maintaining a very poor 0.06 xG per shot rate that suggests his teammates are struggling to get him looks in more dangerous situations. The plus side is that Chelsea has found a better variety of outlets from which to create chances, with Pedro Neto leading the way (10 chances created in five games) ahead of Palmer, Enzo Fernandez and Marc Cucarella. The defense has also improved its ability to slow opponents in the final third, with only five teams conceding fewer shots per game than Chelsea's 7.6 clip. With two teammates joining the corner-kick taker in close proximity, Chelsea dares opponents to sacrifice its defensive presence in the box and instead commit numbers to preventing a cross. Overall, it's been an impressive summer as Chelsea heads into its second season under Maresca. The 2021 Club World Cup champion has set itself up well to potentially return to the final in this expanded format. While Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen were instant insertions upon arriving from Liverpool and Bournemouth, respectively, the real lesson from these first five games has been the apparent first-team readiness of Gonzalo García. With both Benfica and Al Hilal eliminated, one more goal could be enough to give this tournament an unpredictable first Golden Boot winner. Federico Valverde is still a class above in midfield and has been a hit on this side of the Atlantic, generating loud support from Uruguayans and Madrid fans alike. Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham are joint-team leaders with eight chances created apiece, while Courtois is a worthy front-runner for goalkeeper of the tournament. His team plays almost too cleanly, with just 2.9 percent of their turnovers ending in fouls. It's the joint-lowest rate in the field, level with amateur side Auckland City, and one that may open Madrid up to too many counter attacks with which it can contend. As it stands, only two quarterfinalists allowed more shots per game than Madrid's 13.4. The end of their quarterfinal was far from comfortable, with Huijsen now set to miss the final and two conceded goals in extra time. Nonetheless, it's another major tournament with Madrid among the final four sides — a semblance of normalcy in such an unknown sort of competition. Coming into this summer, everyone in the field knew that PSG can attack. That's always been their stronger phase of play, at least since they began operating like a super club, hoping to pad a scoreline enough to overcome defensive shortcomings and some leaky goals in spite of often strong goalkeeping. This summer, Luis Enrique's side has followed up its Champions League breakthrough by leaning even more into refining its improving defense. Through five games, PSG has arguably been the field's best defensive side. Only one team has conceded fewer shots per game (7.4), while only two teams allow a stingier xG per shot faced (0.076). The press has kept opponents from sustaining possession for long (a passes allowed per defensive action taken, or ‘PPDA', of 8.14) while only four teams are winning a greater share of loose balls (61.6 percent recovery rate). Bayern fans will understandably rue Donnarumma for the rest of his career after the challenge that led to Jamal Musiala's gruesome injury. Ousmane Dembele has looked impactful as ever since missing the group stage with injury, scoring from the bench against Bayern. Joao Neves and Achraf Hakimi have given opponents scoring threats to fear beyond the forward line, too. All questions about their high-end capability, immediately after winning Europe, have been answered with a credible on-field balance.

Bayern Munich's 22-year-old young superstar Jamal Musiala suffered a horrific leg injury at the end of the first half of the team's 2-0 Club World Cup quarterfinal loss to PSG Saturday in Atlanta. When the play cleared up, his left ankle could be clearly seen dangling to the side. Bayern players quickly alerted the goalkeeper to stop playing so that the player could be tended to. Numerous teammates surrounded him and put their hands over their heads in disbelief at the severity of the injury. "For me, this isn't a result of constant playing," Bayern sporting director Max Eberl said after the game, according to ESPN. "It is more of an accident, it happened, and this is obviously bad for us." "It didn't look good," Bayern head coach Vincent Kompany said. "If I'm just watching the images, it looked like an ankle injury of some kind, but I'm not going to make a diagnosis here." On Monday Bayern confirmed that their attacker had broken his fibula. Jamal Musiala suffered a fibula fracture and an ankle dislocation and will be sidelined for a long period of time. 💔We are with you every step of the way, Jamal! PSG got two red cards, with Willian Pacho (bad tackle) and Lucas Hernandez (elbow to face) both being booted from the match.

Here's how the Club World Cup semifinals line up: When: Tuesday at 3pm (19:00 GMT) Where: MetLife Stadium, New Jersey The opening semifinal pitches Brazil's Fluminense against English Premier League side Chelsea. Fluminense continue to impress at the CWC with goals from Matheus Martinelli and Hercules securing their place in the last four with a 2-1 win against Al Hilal in Orlando, Florida. Chelsea scored the go-ahead goal on Malo Gusto's 83rd-minute shot, which went in after a pair of deflections, beating Palmeiras 2-1 on Friday night to secure their spot in the semifinals. Gusto's match-winning shot after a short corner kick that appeared to deflect off defender Agustin Giay and goalkeeper Weverton sent the Chelsea fans among the 65,782 spectators into a frenzy. When: Wednesday at 3pm (19:00 GMT) Where: MetLife Stadium, New Jersey The second semifinal features a mouthwatering European heavyweight matchup between PSG and Real Madrid. Nine-man Paris Saint-Germain advanced after defeating Bayern Munich 2-0 with goals from Desire Doue and Ousmane Dembele keeping the French side on track to achieve a historic quadruple of major titles in one season.

Semi ticket cut from $474 to just $13 in New Jersey

Sparse crowds plague tournament outside Real games

PSG v Madrid semi-final still priced from nearly $200

Fifa cut standard ticket prices for the semi-final between Chelsea and Fluminense at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on Tuesday to $13.40 from $473.90 earlier in the past week.

Fifa has used dynamic pricing for the 63-game tournament.

Standard ticket prices for Wednesday's semi-final between European champion Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid in New Jersey start at $199.60.

Fifa had dropped ticket prices to $11.15 for a quarter-final in Orlando, Florida, between Fluminense and Al Hilal. and in Philadelphia between Chelsea and Palmeiras.

The dramatic drop in prices was first reported by the Athletic.

Many matches during the tournament have had sparse crowds. Real Madrid has been an exception, drawing at least 60,000 for all five of their matches, including 76,611 for their quarter-final win Saturday over Borussia Dortmund in New Jersey.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino's start to life as head coach of the United States men's national team has not been as convincing as he and the fans would have liked, but a promising run in this summer's Gold Cup might have begun to turn things around. It's a victory that Pochettino and his players need if they are to demonstrate that things are moving in the right direction before a World Cup on home soil next summer. Though they were only friendlies, those last two losses had USMNT (United States Men's National Team) fans worried. These games, more so than those against regional opponents, are seen as the type of test they will face in the World Cup - and they failed both. With the big tournament less than a year away and only one more competitive game to play, it can be easy to slip into a last-minute panic. There has been a lack of consistency in both personnel and results. The squad appears unresolved, with the group of players called up differing for each camp, something that has mostly been beyond Pochettino's control. Fifty-five players have made appearances for the USA under the Argentine since he was appointed 10 months ago, making it difficult to build momentum and togetherness. Mixed results across those 15 matches have reflected this inconsistency and during this time, they are yet to claim victory against a team in the top 30 of Fifa's rankings. The Gold Cup is Concacaf's Euros and Copa America equivalent. Pochettino's side have experienced a promising campaign despite missing some key players. It has been a bonding experience for the players involved, but it's likely the XI that starts their first World Cup game in Inglewood next June will look significantly different. Star man Pulisic's decision to rest this summer rather than take part in the Gold Cup was particularly controversial given the context of building for next year's home World Cup. The players Pochettino has been able to call upon have developed into a useful unit as the tournament has progressed and it's the most together and determined a US group has looked since he took over. He might wish this togetherness could have been created with his first-choice group but, on the other hand, it has given him a good chance to test fringe players in a competitive, high-pressure environment with a trophy on the line. Some of this contingent have made a good case for inclusion in next summer's 26-man squad. The 21-year-old energetic playmaker, who plays his club football for Real Salt Lake in MLS, has come into his own in the Gold Cup as one of this team's star players. In goal, Matt Freese, of Manchester City's US relative New York City, has been given the nod ahead of Nottingham Forest's Matt Turner all tournament and, bar one mistake against Haiti, has pushed for inclusion at the World Cup. Freese's penalty shootout heroics in the quarter-final against Costa Rica gave him a tournament highlight, doing his chances of a 2026 call-up no harm at all. Elsewhere, midfielder Jack McGlynn, who was also eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland, has showcased his talent on the international stage, Bayer Leverkusen-linked Malik Tillman has impressed in a role just off the striker, and Crystal Palace defender Chris Richards has strengthened his claim for a starting centre-back role. Regardless of what happens against Mexico, this Gold Cup has been a useful experience and a productive exercise - but there's an argument it needed to be more. Sooner rather than later, Pochettino needs to turn this work in progress into a fully prepared first-choice team. If the Club World Cup is a World Cup warm-up for the US in an organisational sense, the Gold Cup is a warm-up for what they will look like as a host nation in terms of how its team plays and how it is supported. Research from renowned US outlet Soccer America revealed that group-stage attendances have dropped compared to recent editions but, though disappointing, this isn't necessarily a sign of things to come at the World Cup. Pochettino, 53, believes they can serve as an example for US fans. The United States doing well and encouraging sports fans to connect with its men's team during 2026 feels more important for US soccer than merely hosting the World Cup. Win, and they'll have met expectations in an impressively resolute fashion while missing some familiar stars.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HOUSTON — The Luna family would gather whenever fútbol called them, but especially, invariably, for occasions like this one. Roughly once per year, parents, siblings and others would assemble around a TV for a soccer game that, as the youngest son now says, is “in my blood.” The U.S. and Mexico men's national teams would meet in Ohio or Mexico City, in Chicago or Pasadena. And back in Sunnyvale, California, the Lunas, like thousands of Mexican American families, would cook up hamburgers or enchiladas; don their favorite jerseys; and cheer or cry through a rivalry that divides and unites. So they would surely gather again on Sunday (7 p.m. ET, Fox/Univision), for the eighth Gold Cup final between the two North American neighbors if not for an extraordinary twist: That youngest son, Diego Luna, will be playing. With nose fractured or intact, with hair bleached blonde or hat backward, he has become the humble, gritty, tattooed, mustachioed face of the national team's rebuild. Now, he is “super excited” to walk into NRG Stadium and “play a game that I've dreamt of as a little kid.” “That's just part of being human, right?” he said Saturday. Many immigrants and children of immigrants feel attached to both teams when their adoptive country and their family's country meet in a soccer match. His parents, who emigrated from Michoacán, Mexico, would celebrate El Tri goals. That led to “little comments” and intra-family “beef.” “I love being Mexican,” he told American Soccer Now in 2022. “But I grew up in the United States.” He could've represented either nation's soccer team. His commitment never seemed to waver, even when U.S. Olympic coaches snubbed him last summer. And even when, 15 minutes into his first start under USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino, a Costa Rican elbow broke his nose and bloodied him. Luna pleaded with coaches and doctors: Let me stay in. Mere moments after returning to the field, with his nostrils plugged, he delivered an assist. "He showed great character,” Pochettino said afterward — and “big balls.” But it was more than just a viral moment. “That is what I want,” Pochettino said more recently. And just as other, more prominent players seemed to lack those attributes, Luna showed, as Pochettino said, that “he is desperate to play for this shirt, for the national team. Born in the Bay Area and raised by a family that “[wasn't] the wealthiest,” he trekked down a circuitous path that, at times, he forged himself. He began under the tutelage of his father and older brother, with a ball at his feet five hours per day, often playing against boys who were two or three years older — and “bigger, faster, stronger.” Then, at 15, he left home. He'd been feeling stuck at the San Jose Earthquakes academy. But he committed to the grind, and over time, his legend grew. They saw a positionless attacker with an atypically stocky, barrel-chested build. As his 18th birthday approached, many wondered whether he'd ever succeed against adults. He recently explained the decision to Unfiltered Soccer: “When you go to MLS Next Pro [Major League Soccer's reserve division], you're gonna be playing against academy players, or guys that are young kids. When you go into USL Championship, that's a division of grown men. El Paso assumed he'd need time to adjust. Instead, within a couple months, Luna was starting. A year later, he was off to Real Salt Lake in MLS. He'd go work his second job after training, less to make money, more to improve his interpersonal skills, which were lacking. He'd built a lifelong connection with the ball; he needed to learn how to build connections with people, via things like eye contact and conversation. He also struggled mentally in his early years as a pro. And that, in 2024, is what led him to seek out a therapist. There was a lot going on in his life. With the therapist, he worked on clearing his head — on “affirmations, breathing exercises, power poses … mindfulness, being present.” It was something “I struggled with a lot,” he told Apple TV. Seven months later, he was MLS Young Player of the Year. Two months after that, he was in USMNT camp. And in an otherwise meaningless B-team friendly against Costa Rica, he had a choice. Luna asked for a chance to at least see out the first half. He eventually departed at halftime, went to a hospital and underwent surgery. By the time he awoke, his family and agent were calling him “Big Balls,” and, still woozy, he initially panicked: Is my hospital gown loose? Then he learned of Pochettino's comment, and the meaning behind it. The entire experience, Luna said last month, “was life-changing.” It earned him an A-team call-up in March. And as the USMNT's stars slumped to two defeats, Luna was the one player Pochettino singled out in a positive light. “When I told [him] today, ‘You are going to play,' he was red. A couple months later, Luna was named to this Gold Cup roster. Reflecting on the January episode, he said: “I think it added an opportunity for me to come back into more camps and show the type of grit and the hunger that I have to play and represent for my country. Playing as a left-sided attacking midfielder, with “confidence” and “comfort” and the freedom “to express myself,” he scored in a quarterfinal against Costa Rica, then twice in the semi against Guatemala. Luna himself spoke about “the grit” and “determination we've been lacking. And whereas some teammates struggled in a cauldron of Guatemalan noise, shook by the intensity of the crowd and semifinal opponent, Luna said: “I loved it. He knows that the next one, Sunday's final, will be even more “hostile.” He also knows it will unearth emotions, “a lot of emotions” — emotions that, as the current U.S. roster's only Mexican American, will be unique to him. But come midday, he said, “it's about locking in.” It is a massive occasion, personally and professionally, perhaps the biggest moment of his young career. But when clocks here in Houston strike 6:06 p.m., and 70,000 people roar, he will simply have to do what he always does: “I'm gonna give 100% for the jersey that I'm wearing.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the U.S. national team prepares to vie for a Gold Cup championship without him and several other regulars Sunday night against Mexico, polarizing young American and local product Gio Reyna did not get off the bench again in his supposed homecoming on Saturday. Reyna's attitude issues and lack of playing time were controversial storylines at the previous World Cup in Qatar in 2022 under since-fired coach Gregg Berhalter, who publicly clashed with the young player's parents, including former national team captain Claudio Reyna. With Gio Reyna, Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and others not rostered during this CONCACAF window, the U.S. squad has relied upon and received intriguing production from several emerging players during its Gold Cup run. Diego Luna, Malik Tillman and Patrick Agyemang are among those building cases to play themselves into creative roles a year from now. Including Saturday's match, Reyna only saw action in Club World Cup play against South Korean club Ulsan Hyundai in the group round. There had been some thinking that Reyna might get on the pitch Saturday with Jobe Bellingham — whose brother Jude plays for Real Madrid — suspended for the quarters due to yellow-card accumulation. But Dortmund manager Niko Kovac did not use Reyna for the fourth time in five games, casting further doubt about his future with the German power. It would make sense for him to seek a transfer if he's not in the plans. Earlier this year, Reyna said in an interview with the FIFA website that he was “excited” about the possibility of playing near where he grew up. All you need to get started is an email address. DAZN also has premium, paid options available to enhance your viewing experience with HDR picture, Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound, and fewer ads. “It's one of those stadiums that I've watched [games in] so much growing up that it's maybe going to be a little bit strange to actually be on the pitch there,” Reyna said of MetLife Stadium. “Gio is a player of Dortmund [for] four or five years,” Kovac said earlier in the tournament. “He is a part of my team at the moment. Gio is for sure a player who didn't play so much, but we know exactly his strengths, but we have top players here in the squad. “The confidence is very big, so hopefully every player can get minutes, but I can't promise you this is depending also on the results, also injuries, but my ambition is to give every player minutes.</p>
