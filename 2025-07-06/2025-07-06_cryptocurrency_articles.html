                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trading volumes in altcoins such as Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) are surging as the current rally in cryptocurrencies accelerates. Cardano's price has risen more than 6% over the past 24 hours as trading volumes spiked amidst a strengthening rally in digital assets. The price of Solana is currently at $152.45 per token, having gained as much as 5% in the past 24 hours. Altcoins are broadly defined as any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin (BTC), which is the biggest digital currency by market capitalization. Market analysts remain divided on Cardano's short-term prospects and how long the altcoin rally will last. Some analysts point to bearish on-chain metrics, including declining active wallets. However, cryptocurrencies in general have been rallying alongside stocks in recent weeks, with the benchmark S&P 500 index now at a record high. Having put concerns about trade wars and tariffs behind them, investors continue to pile into risk assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. ADA is up nearly 50% over the last 12 months. Most Wall Street firms don't offer ratings or price targets on cryptocurrencies such as Cardano, so we'll look instead at its three-month performance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cardano has made headlines within crypto chatrooms after officially surpassing 111 million in total transactions on its blockchain network. This impressive milestone, alongside other notable ecosystem growth, underscores the network's growing user base and strong platform fundamentals. After all, the network has maintained a remarkable uptime spanning seven years. Per recent data, the Cardano platform now supports 2,005 active projects, with delegated staking wallets up by 0.05% to 1.33 million. The Cardano network also shows strong on-chain momentum amid growing bullish outlooks and increased adoption. Given its strong performance and increased utility, it's no surprise that the Cardano community sentiment has hit a monthly high. At present, approximately 93.8% of users on CoinMarketCap are favoring the asset to be bullish. Crypto commentator Ali Martinez explained that if ADA closes above $0.67, it could kickstart a northbound movement to between $0.83 and $0.91. These levels, which served as resistance zones early last year, could become key price targets if upside pressure mounts. Prominent market personality Lucky Luciano is bullish on the asset, suggesting it is bound to hit “higher levels.” Assuming ADA reclaims its November 2023 peak, Lucky believes it could hit a long-term target of $1.32. CoinCodex's price prediction model aligns with this long-range forecast. As per data, the coin is projected to trade between $1.18 and $1.31 by December 2027. With this new program, builders can create dApps directly within the Cardano node. Experts believe that if this product goes mainstream, Cardano will further cement its position as a top layer-1 network in the cryptosphere.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most people would say that Bitcoin will end because of quantum technology, however, I believe there's another answer. Ever since Bitcoin debuted in 2009, people have speculated about the survival of this digital currency. Many people believed that it would go to zero, but 16 years later, governments are recognizing its potential as gold 2.0. Bitcoin has proven its reliability as an asset after reaching almost $112,000 per coin. Bitcoin is an asset class—other altcoins aren't included in this category. This is because BTC is among the top 10 assets ranked by market cap according to data from Infinite Market Cap. Despite the massive success of Bitcoin, there's a technological phenomenon I believe that would kill the crypto king. Quantum computing is considered a major threat to Bitcoin. More specifically, quantum computers could break the complex mathematical algorithms that support modern cryptography. It could also make it possible to access dormant wallets and spend any Bitcoins from the Satoshi era. The behavior of atoms and subatomic particles is unique and classical physics laws like Newton's laws can't fully explain it. There are specific principles and phenomena that explain quantum mechanics such as superposition, quantization, etc. Computer science is the study of computational systems and it includes algorithms, data structure, programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, etc. But how could quantum computing crack the Bitcoin algorithm? In a p2pk address, the public key is exposed on the blockchain by default, even before any coins are spent. P2pk and p2pkh addresses were dominant in the early days of Bitcoin. The BTC mined by Satoshi Nakamoto are stored in p2pk addresses. In 2020, the number of Bitcoins in p2pk addresses was around 2 million coins, while p2pkh addresses had 2.5 million coins. A total of 4.5 million Bitcoins is equivalent to around $490 billion. In terms of processing speed, a quantum computer must derive the private key and broadcast a competing transaction before the next block is mined, typically within 10 minutes. So if a quantum computer takes two hours to derive a private key from a publicly available public key, it won't be able to spend the Bitcoins—because transactions are typically confirmed within 10 minutes. However, if the address is reused and receives new coins after the public key has already been revealed, those new funds become vulnerable, and the quantum computer could potentially spend them. As the name indicates, an NEMP generates a pulse of electromagnetic radiation from a nuclear explosion, especially one detonated at high altitude. This results in an extremely high voltage and current surges into anything that conducts electricity — wires, antennas, power lines, computers, electronics etc. Because of the high altitude, an NEMP explosion can affect thousands of kilometers and impact an entire country or even continent. According to a YouGov poll, around 68 to 76% of Europeans and Americans believe that nuclear arms will be used in World War III. Analysts also point to growing tensions between major nuclear powers, including Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and the US. If a global-scale NEMP attack happens, it could wipe out Bitcoin mining equipment, nodes, internet infrastructure and modern technology as we know it today. In 1949 Albert Einstein said “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.” Most people would say that Bitcoin will end because of quantum technology, however, I believe there's another answer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On July 6, Max Crown, CEO of the TON Foundation, announced on X a "groundbreaking initiative" offering toncoin TON$2.8896 holders the "exclusive chance" to secure a 10-year UAE Golden Visa. After the three-year lock-up period, staked funds can apparently be unlocked, and during this time, applicants reportedly earn an estimated 3–4% annual percentage yield (APY) on their staked tokens. The TON Foundation's website highlights several key alleged benefits: fast approval within seven weeks from document submission, a simple process without the need to purchase real estate or meet income thresholds, and inclusion of family members — spouse, children, and parents — at no extra cost beyond standard government fees. The program claims to offer a capital-efficient alternative to traditional UAE Golden Visa routes, which the TON Foundation says typically require a minimum investment of approximately $540,000 in real estate or fixed deposits, often tied to illiquid assets and longer processing times. The TON Golden Visa initiative is touted as a faster, more affordable, and digitally native pathway to UAE residency, aligning with the country's ambition to become a global crypto and Web3 hub. The announcement had an immediate impact on toncoin's market performance. Additionally, the current 24-hour average trading volume is approximately 251.54% higher than the 30-day average, signaling heightened market interest and activity, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Bobby Ong, co-founder and COO of CoinGecko, praised the partnership as an “amazing story” that could attract whales and provide strong buy support for toncoin, although he expressed hope that the initiative is not a temporary scheme. Conversely, "Joe HedgedHog" ("@JoeHedgedHog" on X), an investment partner at Sigil Fund, pointed out that this is not an official UAE government partnership but rather a third-party legal firm using TON as a proxy to assist clients applying for the Golden Visa under the entrepreneur category. He noted that the firm could have used any cryptocurrency and that the staking requirement serves more as a token utility sink than a government mandate. He argued that the staked TON balance is only one of several requirements and may no longer be relevant under updated rules. He went on to say that the absence of blanket approval for TON stakers means that acceptance is uncertain, and the program may primarily serve as a marketing tool coupled with token utility. Changpeng Zhao (CZ), co-founder and former CEO of Binance, expressed cautious interest in the TON Foundation's UAE Golden Visa announcement but highlighted several uncertainties. CZ also mentioned that theUAE regulators classify staking as a regulated activity for which TON may lack licenses. Importantly, he pointed out that official UAE government channels do not currently recognize staking toncoin as a visa qualification, listing the standard Golden Visa categories instead. In a follow-up post, CZ reiterated his cautious optimism, emphasizing the need to “trust but verify.” He acknowledged the potential benefits of such a program but stressed that official government partnerships and announcements are essential for legitimacy—none of which have yet been confirmed. His stance balances support for innovation and TON founder Pavel Durov with prudent skepticism about the program's current status. The UAE entrepreneur visa category, which this program appears to target, is designed for individuals owning economic projects of a technical or innovative nature.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Major cryptocurrencies rose Sunday morning as the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at upcoming trade deals before the July 9 Liberation Day tariff deadline. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, gained over 1%, briefly topping $109,000. Payments-focused XRP and Solana's SOL token gained over 2% each, with meme token dogecoin DOGE$0.1707 rising 3%, according to data source CoinDesk. In an interview with CNN, Bessent stated that the U.S. is close to finalizing several trade deals ahead of the July 9 deadline, when the temporary pause in higher tariffs initially announced on April 2 is set to expire. "President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly," Bessent said, per Reuters. Bessent explained that July 9 remains the deadline for negotiations, failing which higher tariffs, announced in early April, will take effect from Aug. 1. "We are saying this is when it's happening. If you want to speed things up, have at it. Since taking office early this year, President Donald Trump has been focused on making the U.S. wealthy again by imposing tariffs on goods imported from other countries, a coercive tactic aimed at rebalancing trade relations and reducing the U.S. trade deficit. Since then, the so-called U.S. exceptionalism has resurfaced in financial markets, lifting major U.S. equity indices to record highs. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have outperformed their global peers, with BTC rallying to trade above $100,000. Omkar holds small amounts of bitcoin, ether, BitTorrent, tron and dot.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. A Reddit post struck a nerve in the crypto community, sparking heated debate over one of investing's most painful questions: When do you take profits? The post's central thesis is brutally simple: Despite what keyboard warriors claim today, virtually everyone who bought Bitcoin in its early days would have sold long before it reached current prices. Trade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses — no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies. Grow your IRA or 401(k) with Crypto – unlock the power of alternative investments including a Crypto IRA within your retirement account. The Reddit discussion reveals a fundamental tension between investment theory and human psychology. The fact that Bitcoin later reached $60,000+ doesn't retroactively make selling at $100 a mistake. “Nothing is guaranteed in investing,” the original poster emphasized. “Anyone who saw their investment multiply by 1000x and didn't cash out was essentially gambling.” One of the most insightful comments came from a user who highlighted how net worth influences selling decisions. For someone with substantial assets, letting it ride might make more sense as “play money.” This observation cuts to the heart of position sizing and risk management—concepts that crypto's “diamond hands” culture often overlooks. Get up to $400 in rewards for successfully completing short educational courses and making your first qualifying trade on Coinbase. Several commenters claimed to have held through massive gains, with one user reporting 300x returns while vowing to “never sell Bitcoin even at x3000.” But even among the diamond hands crowd, practical challenges emerged. One commenter admitted, “I've been holding BTC because I don't know where to sell it,” highlighting the gap between investment philosophy and execution. One user shared how they lost 80% of their crypto holdings when the Voyager exchange collapsed, watching their “6 figure net worth reduced to 4 figure inside a week.” This story underscores a critical point often lost in crypto success stories: unrealized gains aren't real until they're realized. One suggested time-locking Bitcoin to enforce long-term holding while still allowing eventual profit-taking—releasing a set amount each year over a decade, for instance. It's a recognition that perfect market timing is impossible, but systematic profit-taking can work.

As one commenter noted, “Hindsight is a b*tch.” Every investment decision must be made with incomplete information and uncertain outcomes. Start with position sizing: Never invest more than you can afford to lose completely. Plan your exits: Before making any investment, decide at what point you'll take profits. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good: Taking some profits after significant gains isn't “paper hands”—it's risk management. Exchange failures, regulatory changes, and market crashes are all real possibilities. The Reddit discussion reveals an uncomfortable truth: Most successful long-term crypto holders succeeded despite their strategy, not because of it. The difference between conviction and stubbornness is often just luck.

Milestone deal to simplify real estate investing through tokenisation, digital currencies

Dubai: The Dubai Land Department has signed a partnership with Crypto.com to develop a blockchain-powered investment environment for virtual real estate — a move that could reshape how people buy, sell, and invest in property.

The agreement, signed on July 6, 2025, supports Dubai's Real Estate Strategy 2033 and its Dh1 trillion transaction target by aiming to create a secure, fully digital system for tokenised property assets.

Under the deal, the Dubai Land Department and Crypto.com will explore ways to let people trade real estate using digital currencies and blockchain technology. This includes investor verification, digital custody, settlements, and the tokenisation of real estate assets — all designed to boost transparency, liquidity, and ease of access for investors.

"This marks a major step toward building a smart, integrated digital property ecosystem in Dubai," said officials at the signing event. The initiative aligns with the government's recent announcement allowing the use of digital currencies for government fee payments — another signal of Dubai's commitment to embracing future-ready technologies.

Crypto.com will provide the tech solutions and advisory support, while the Dubai Land Department will ensure regulatory compliance and help implement pilot projects under its existing legal framework.

The partnership positions Dubai at the forefront of digital real estate innovation, potentially opening the market to global investors looking for smarter, tech-driven opportunities in one of the world's fastest-growing cities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and Solana are in for astronomical upside if they both complete a cup and handle breakout pattern, monthly chart analysis concludes. Bitcoin and Solana can reach parabolic new highs if both crypto tokens successfully complete a cup and handle pattern, according to analysis. In his latest analysis, the popular X content creator, Trader Alan, delivered a giant $4,390 Solana (SOL) price target. Bitcoin has spent seven weeks acting within a narrow range, but as time goes on, anticipation is growing as to where BTC price action will head next. For Trader Alan, a familiar chart pattern holds the key — and so far, progress is exactly what bulls are hoping for. “Bitcoin and Solana Cup and Handle Pattern on monthly chart,” he told X followers, adding that SOL/USD is currently attempting to copy BTC. As Cointelegraph reported, BTC/USD has already completed a long-term cup and handle, from its 2021 peak to 2022 low and back up, followed by its first trip to the $100,000 mark. While the BTC/USD target still represents 115% gains, it is comparatively modest when viewed next to Solana's roadmap, which calls for upside of nearly 3,000%.

In the absence of “altseason,” however, such a parabolic move faces significant hurdles. However, as Cointelegraph noted, BTC dominance hitting 70% has historically coincided with the start of altcoin strength. Earlier, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital added that this cycle may not need a tag of the 70% zone for altseason to begin. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

It's a fair question that cuts to the heart of Bitcoin's identity crisis—and the answer reveals why Bitcoin might be succeeding precisely because it's failing as a traditional currency.

The debate immediately split into two camps, each with a fundamentally different vision of what Bitcoin should be. The “Electronic Cash” Purists point to Satoshi Nakamoto's original white paper, titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” As one commenter put it: “Bitcoin is explicitly designed to function as peer-to-peer electronic cash. The “Digital Gold” Advocates argue that Bitcoin has evolved beyond its original purpose. “It is not designed to be used as a payment vehicle... This isn't just an academic debate—it reveals a profound shift in how Bitcoin is being positioned and used in the real world. “What percentage of the population owns gold?” multiple commenters asked. Gold isn't widely used for daily transactions, yet it maintains value as a store of wealth. Similarly, Bitcoin supporters argue that widespread ownership isn't necessary for utility. “I don't own gold so that I can take it to Walmart to buy a TV,” one user explained. Get up to $400 in rewards for successfully completing short educational courses and making your first qualifying trade on Coinbase. This phrase, repeated throughout the thread, represents more than just optimism—it's a fundamental belief that Bitcoin adoption follows a different trajectory than traditional currencies or payment systems. “Adoption isn't linear, it's exponential!” one commenter declared. Supporters argue that Bitcoin's current 5% ownership rate is actually impressive for a 15-year-old technology challenging millennia-old monetary systems. “Bitcoin, like all cryptocurrencies, is best understood as a collectible asset,” wrote one skeptic. “Its value is not tied to any underlying cash flows... What gives it value is belief and shared conviction that it's scarce, desirable, and that someone else in the future will likely pay more for it.” This perspective frames Bitcoin not as a currency or even a store of value, but as a digital collectible whose worth depends entirely on the greater fool theory—the hope that someone else will pay more for it later. “I still have yet to meet or see someone pay with bitcoin. It's always from an investment perspective,” one user admitted. The discussion revealed an uncomfortable truth: Bitcoin's current infrastructure doesn't support widespread adoption as a currency. At roughly 3 transactions per second, the network would allow each person on Earth to make one Bitcoin transaction every 3.5 years. Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network are supposed to address these scaling issues, but they remain largely theoretical for most users.

The Reddit debate reveals three key insights for anyone considering Bitcoin: Bitcoin's Value Proposition Is Evolving Whether you see this as a natural evolution or a betrayal of Bitcoin's original vision depends on your perspective. Gold's monetary role historically came from scarcity, not ubiquity. The next few years will determine whether Bitcoin becomes a lasting store of value or just an expensive lesson in collective delusion. Bitcoin's limited adoption might be exactly what gives it value in a world of infinite money printing. As one commenter noted: “Its value is 95% speculation so 5% seems about right.” For investors, the question isn't whether Bitcoin will achieve universal adoption as a currency. The question is whether 5% of the population believing in Bitcoin's scarcity narrative is enough to sustain and grow its value over time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While MicroStrategy popularized bitcoin as a store of value, SharpLink Gaming is revolutionizing the approach with Ethereum. The company holds 500 million dollars in ETH, which it presents as the “foundational layer of global finance.” A strategy that goes beyond a simple store of value. This Nasdaq-listed company, specializing in marketing for online sports betting, became the first public company to adopt Ethereum (ETH) as its primary treasury reserve asset. This decision is based on a 425 million dollar private placement conducted at the end of May by Consensys, a giant in the Ethereum ecosystem. Between late May and mid-June, the company acquired 176,271 ETH for a total of 463 million dollars, at an average price of 2,626 dollars per unit. A few days later, it added an additional 12,207 ETH for 30.7 million dollars, partly financed by “At-The-Market” (ATM) stock sales. Even more impressive: 100% of these assets are deployed in staking solutions, already generating more than 540,000 dollars in rewards since the launch of the strategy. On the market side, ETH shows stability around 2,505 $, with a modest 0.56% increase in 24 hours.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Buzzwords include: succinct universal proofs, zkVM, incrementally verifiable computation, distributed supercomputer and agentic AI Nexus is billing itself as “the world supercomputer.” The L1's ambitions are on full display as it churns through its final testnet ahead of mainnet launch, slated for later this year. Anyone can join the network in a few clicks from any device, contributing compute power to help build what Nexus calls “a verifiable world.” It's a novel approach, according to CEO and founder Daniel Marin: “The goal there is to build the largest distributed computer system ever, and part of the reason we're doing that is because we're trying to aggregate computing power to build a blockchain with a new architecture,” Marin told Blockworks. Nexus combines familiar ideas from other cutting-edge chains but integrates them into a single, opinionated layer-1. Like Mina Protocol, Nexus aims to condense all blockchain states into a single succinct proof — but while Mina uses recursive SNARKs for constant-size proofs, Nexus relies on its RISC-V-based zkVM to handle vastly more complex workloads, including AI inference. For data availability, Nexus' planned sampling approach echoes Celestia's modular DA model, while its consensus will evolve from the current and commonly used CometBFT (formerly Tendermint) toward HotStuff-2, making it similar to Aptos or Sui. These consensus protocols provide fast finality — in Nexus' case, coordinating globally distributed proving tasks. Nexus then bakes in a decentralized compute cloud directly into its L1, turning every connected device into part of a single, verifiable computer built around an Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC) machine. The VM generates succinct proofs for every computation step, integrates those proofs via DAG-style propagation, and aggregates them into a single Universal Proof. That's a lot of buzzwords, but the TL;DR is this architecture theoretically enables horizontal scalability — each added node increases network throughput. On the cryptography front, Nexus touts the involvement of heavyweight figures like Jens Groth and Michel Abdalla, fortifying its credentials in zero‑knowledge and blockchain research. Nexus claims over 2.1 million unique users across its various testnets, backed up by Sybil detection. “We want to be decentralized in the long term, [but] we don't want to be decentralized right now at all, and in fact, pretty much the opposite,” Marin continued. We're part of a community and a network, I can see other apps in the ecosystem, I can do quests and have fun,'” Marin said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Secret Service quietly amasses one of the world's largest crypto cold wallets with $400 million seized, exposing scams through blockchain sleuthing and VPN missteps. The agency's Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) has tracked funds through open-source tools, blockchain analysis, and patience, Jamie Lam, an investigative analyst with the US Secret Service, reportedly told law enforcement officials in Bermuda last month. The agency's crypto trove, much of which sits in a single cold-storage wallet, results from a string of investigations into scams. Scammers lure targets into seemingly legitimate crypto investment platforms in one typical scheme. Victims often see initial profits before the sites vanish with their deposits. Related: Brazil's central bank service provider hacked, $140M stolen Lam's team uses domain records, blockchain transactions, and VPN slip-ups to identify fraudsters. In one case, a cryptocurrency payment led investigators to another wallet. In another one, a brief VPN failure exposed an IP address, helping agents piece together the scam's digital trail. At the helm of the Secret Service's crypto strategy is Kali Smith, who directs a team that has trained officials in over 60 countries to unmask online financial crimes. The agency has focused on jurisdictions with weak oversight or programs selling residency to foreign nationals. “Sometimes after just a week-long training, they can be like, ‘Wow, we didn't even realize that this is occurring in our country,'” Smith said. The Secret Service's work has uncovered scams ranging from romance-investment schemes to sextortion cases. Analysts traced the payments through another coerced teenager acting as a money mule, leading to an account tied to nearly $4.1 million in transactions under a Nigerian passport. Crypto-related scams have become the top driver of US internet crime losses. Meanwhile, the first half of 2025 has seen more than $2.47 billion in losses due to hacks, scams and exploits, representing a nearly 3% increase compared to the $2.4 billion stolen in 2024. Recovering stolen crypto often depends on cooperation from industry players.
