                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tech world's most consequential feud has flared up again. Elon Musk and Bill Gates, two men who have shaped the modern world, are locked in a bitter public dispute, this time over foreign aid cuts with life or death stakes. A little over a month after Musk's departure from his role in the Trump administration, where he led efforts to slash federal spending, Gates took to X, Musk's own social network, to condemn the devastating impact of those cuts on global health. Drawing on new reports, Gates presented a grim tally of the human cost. It found that, by 2040, 8 million more children will die before their fifth birthday,” Gates posted on July 3, linking to the medical journal's study. He followed up by highlighting the threat to HIV treatment programs. “According to a @UNAIDS analysis, ending PEPFAR-supported programs for people living with HIV could result in an additional 4.2 million deaths by 2029,” Gates stated, providing a link to the report. Driving the point home, he warned that pulling vaccine funding would have catastrophic results. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has helped immunize over 1.1 billion children since 2000. “The U.S. announced that, after this year, it's pulling out all its money,” Gates wrote. “If that happens, Gavi estimates that 75 million children will miss vaccinations over the next five years—and of those, 1.2 million children will die.” His conclusion was blunt: “The facts are simple and devastating: Aid cuts have already cost lives, and the number of deaths will continue to rise.” Gates argued for a reversal, noting that global health is a tiny fraction of the federal budget. While Gates never mentioned Musk by name, the world's richest man felt targeted and seized on another user's post to launch a counterattack. The user blasted Gates, writing, “Bro, you are worth $117 billion. If you really think aid cuts are costing lives, feel free to make up the difference.” He then added a personal jab, dismissing Gates's philanthropic motives. As of July 5, Musk's net worth is estimated at $361 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, while Gates's fortune sits at $124 billion. The animosity between Musk and Gates is not new. It stems from a deep grudge Musk holds over Gates for shorting Tesla stock. Musk has never forgotten Gates's bet against his electric car company and brings it up frequently. “Gates placed a massive bet on Tesla dying when our company was at one of its weakest moments several years ago,” Musk posted in September 2023. Taking out a short position against Tesla, as Gates did, results in the highest return only if a company goes bankrupt! Gates placed a massive bet on Tesla dying when our company was at one of its weakest moments several years ago. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

This year, the Dell 15-inch 3530 laptop (Intel 10-Core i5-1334U, 1TB PCIe SSD, 32GB DDR4 RAM) is the best example of just how low these prices can go: You can pick up this beast of a machine right now for only $649, a whopping 73% off its regular price of $2,399. That means snappy and responsive performance when you're multitasking or running demanding programs. Paired with a spacious 32GB of DDR4 RAM, this Dell laptop can handle demanding workloads and have multiple applications open in the background without slowing down. It also comes with a massive 1TB PCIe SSD which gives you instant boot-up times, quick file transfers and plenty of space for all of your files. The SSD also helps to keep the laptop quiet and power-efficient with less heat and noise than traditional hard drives. The 15-inch full HD screen provides a clear image with a 120Hz refresh rate, and everything from spreadsheets to streamed video appears smooth. The laptop has a number of ports including HDMI and USB Type-C (with an adapter), so you can hook up external monitors, storage, and more. The integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics are more than capable of handling daily visual tasks. This Dell 15 3530 laptop comes with Windows 11 Pro, and offers a secure and modern operating system that's ready to work or play straight out of the box. The non-backlit keyboard has a 10-key numeric keypad and it is ideal for anyone who works with numbers or prefers a full keyboard layout. Weighing in at only 2,200 grams (approximately 4.85 pounds) and under an inch in depth, it's light enough to carry wherever life takes you. With Prime Day deals like this, stock is sure to move fast so don't wait too long to grab yours before this offer disappears. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

AirPods Pro 2 are in stores just a year but already they set the benchmark by which other wireless earbuds with active noise cancellation are judged. On the subject of sound quality, nothing else comes close to holding a candle right now. Normally these earbuds cost $249, but Amazon is offering them over 30% off early Prime Day, reducing the price to as low as $169. This deal is for everyone (and not just Prime members) and it is a rarity for an Apple device. Remember, Apple never really offers straight discounts and many are waiting for Prime Day or Black Friday to get Apple devices at a markdown. Transparency mode tunes you in to what's going on around you, and adaptive audio combines noise cancellation with transparency for the best listening under any conditions. Conversation awareness is another intelligent feature and it knows to turn the volume down automatically so you never miss a word when you're speaking with someone nearby. Personalized spatial audio is one of the unique features that molds the sound to your unique ear shape and uses dynamic head tracking to deliver a surround-sound immersion: You can listen to a few select songs, TV programs and movies in Dolby Atmos, enhancing your entertainment to be more real than ever. It's easy and simple to control: swipe, press, or hold the stem to manage playback, and Siri interactions for hands-free. With the Apple-designed H2 chip and a driver tuned by Apple, you'll have incredibly immersive sound with crisp highs and deep bass. They also come equipped with four sets of silicone tips of different sizes so that you can pick the perfect fit for your ears. The tips create an acoustic seal that prevents noise and keeps earbuds in position even during high-intensity workout or prolonged listening. The case itself is full of functionality and includes precision finding, a built-in speaker, and a durable lanyard loop for easy carrying. For only $169 early Prime Day, AirPods Pro 2 are now as affordable as most cheap earbuds without sacrificing any of it. Make sure you grab yours before they run out of stock.

That doesn't leave you much time if you want to get your hands on one of the most popular deals before they are… gone.

For (early) Prime Day, Amazon has an amazing 50% discount and brings the price down to $399 from its usual price of $799. Looks like Amazon is clearing out stock with no margin left, make sure you don't miss this opportunity. The Roomba Plus 405 is a complete cleaning system that is designed to handle both mopping and vacuuming with amazing efficiency. It possesses 70 times more suction power than the Roomba 600 series and devours messes ranging from everyday crumbs to stubborn pet footprints. The dual spinning mop pads (when paired with SmartScrub technology) deliver double the scrubbing power and downward pressure of standard vacuum and mop modes so even dried-on grime and dried-up spills get cleaned appropriately. With cleaning solution or even water, it performs amazingly well on carpets and hard floors. The ClearView LiDAR system maps your house quickly and optimizes coverage for an in-depth clean every time. This intelligent mapping allows you to target the cleaning to specific rooms or zones with Clean Zones and you can even set Keep Out Zones to avoid sensitive spots or pet food bowls. You may also instruct your robot using your voice assistant of choice or simply push the buttons on the unit itself. This is the first time this flagship Roomba has been discounted, and at half price, it's an offer you won't want to miss. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

TrashBench, an overclocking and BIOS tuning enthusiast, has pushed the old favorite Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 to 2,202 MHz using a DIY cooler. The Redditor and TechTuber stuck to the aging GeForce's stock BIOS and stock voltage, but the home-made copper pipe cooling can only be reasonably described as ‘something else.' Aesthetics aside, the cooler propelled this card to a stunning five-fold victory in the official 3DMark Fire Strike chart (for systems packing a Core i5-12600KF). With their trusty old Asus GTX 1060 6GB in hand, TrashBench removed the stock cooler and prepared for the GPU refit by crushing an assortment of copper piping lengths, acquired from a home DIY store, for better component contact. Next, the now adjusted lengths of copper pipe were positioned over strategic areas of the PCB (VRMs, VRAM), and G-clamped in place. A water block and pump were attached to the GPU, and flexible pipes included the copper lengths in a loop – fed by a sizable jerry can of iced water for the reservoir. With the DIY cooler setup ready to roll, and sensibly attached some distance from the host PC using a lengthy riser cable, TrashBench started work. For context, the stock cooled Asus GeForce GTX 1060 that TrashBench started with achieved an ‘excellent' 12,675 Fire Strike score just ahead of the modding work. That's almost a 13% improvement in the overall benchmark score. TrashBench now has their eye on some fun based on a GTX 1080 Ti, and teased the possibility of adding voltage mods to the tuning mix for this legendary GPU.

As such, Activision's marquee title, Call of Duty, has been slowly making its way over to Xbox and PC Game Pass. One of these games is Call of Duty: WWII, released in 2017 and still going strong in 2025... up until it was hacked to oblivion over the weekend. Gamers are going ballisticCall of Duty WWII, available on Xbox PC Game Pass, contains an unpatched RCE exploitSomeone is trolling gamers with Notepad pop ups, PC shutdowns, and gay pornography pic.twitter.com/FLNzRbLt1sJuly 3, 2025 For context, RCE stands for remote code execution and is a way of running malicious code on a computer without actually needing to be there in person. The bad actor gets access to your computer through loopholes in the security system, then injects a payload containing said malicious code that can wreak havoc on your computer. So far, there have been no reports of any serious harm done to COD: WWII players, but this is a dangerous tactic, nonetheless. It's important to note that such exploits can only really work on PC since consoles do not provide the level of code execution freedom a conventional computer does, in order to pursue these shenanigans. Obviously, consoles do get hacked, but this particular issue is exclusive to PC and, unfortunately, has been a common occurrence with older COD titles for a long time. Activision introduced its "Ricochet" anti-cheat system in 2019—with COD: Modern Warfare—to combat things like this. Therefore, without the level of protection needed against malicious operators, COD: WWII, which came out two years prior to Ricochet's introduction, is apparently fair game for hacking. Moreover, COD: WWII still relies on P2P matchmaking, an archaic way of connecting two players (and their computers) together in order to enable multiplayer. This method has been succeeded with a dedicated server model in which all players connect to the server, which receives their input and sends it back and forth in real-time. As you could probably guess, directly connecting two players to each other leaves a lot of vulnerability on the table, which hackers exploited in the case of COD: WWII.

More interestingly, though, @LasagneManne revealed what looks like the exact tool these hackers are using to pull off their exploits. Let's hope Activision has a patch ready to address this unfettered access soon enough.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You'd better get the Switch 2 console before tariffs strike. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Unfortunately, Nintendo, which manufactures the Switch 2 consoles in Vietnam, used the 10% tariff amount for its earnings forecast, according to PCMag. This means that the tariff change may throw a wrench into its plans. But despite seemingly arriving in good numbers in the U.S. and the U.K., customers from other countries have complained of shortages, with its president, Shuntaro Furukawa, apologizing to shareholders for failing to anticipate the massive demand. It has also been a victim of geopolitics, with the console revealed to the world on April 2, 2025 — the same day that Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs, which imposed massive taxes on Vietnamese goods. This meant that the $449 launch price of the console might no longer be viable and could force Nintendo and its retailers to hike up their prices. This led to a delay in pre-orders, as the company was probably considering its next moves. Thankfully, these massive tariffs were suspended for 90 days starting April 9, even though a base 10% tariff remained. Despite that, Nintendo was able to retain the original launch price console and had pre-orders starting on April 24 — accessories saw modest price increases, though. As of now, there is no finalized official document, yet, that confirms these changes, so we don't know if and when this will take effect.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine. When Todd Sacktor was about to turn 3, his 4-year-old sister died of leukemia. A swing set with two seats instead of one,” he said, recalling the lingering traces of her presence in the house. “There was this missing person—never spoken of—for which I had only one memory.” That memory, faint but enduring, was set in the downstairs den of their home. A young Sacktor asked his sister to read him a book, and she brushed him off: “Go ask your mother.” Sacktor glumly trudged up the stairs to the kitchen. It's remarkable that, more than 60 years later, Sacktor remembers this fleeting childhood moment at all. The astonishing nature of memory is that every recollection is a physical trace, imprinted into brain tissue by the molecular machinery of neurons. How the essence of a lived moment is encoded and later retrieved remains one of the central unanswered questions in neuroscience. Sacktor became a neuroscientist in pursuit of an answer. The question that has always held his attention was first articulated in 1984 by the famed biologist Francis Crick: How can memories persist for years, even decades, when the body's molecules degrade and are replaced in a matter of days, weeks or, at most, months? As these proteins degrade, new ones take their place in a connected molecular swap that maintains the bond's integrity and, therefore, the memory. “How then is memory stored in the brain so that its trace is relatively immune to molecular turnover?” he wrote in Nature. The researchers present “a very convincing case” that “the interaction between these two molecules is needed for memory storage,” said Karl Peter Giese, a neurobiologist at King's College London who was not involved with the work. The findings offer a compelling response to Crick's dilemma, reconciling the discordant timescales to explain how ephemeral molecules maintain memories that last a lifetime. After studying under the molecular memory pioneer James Schwartz at Columbia University, he opened his own lab at SUNY Downstate to search for a molecule that might help explain how long-term memories persist. Then he searched for any molecular changes that had taken place. “By the fourth time, I was like, this is it,” he said. It was protein kinase M zeta, or PKMζ for short. As the rats' hippocampal tissue was stimulated, synaptic connections strengthened and levels of PKMζ increased. Todd Sacktor has devoted his career to pursuing the molecular nature of memory. Over the next two decades, he would go on to build a body of work showing that PKMζ's presence helps maintain memories long after their initial formation. When Sacktor blocked the molecule's activity an hour after a memory was formed, he saw that synaptic strengthening was reversed. This discovery suggested that PKMζ was “necessary and sufficient” to preserve a memory over time, he wrote in Nature Neuroscience in 2002. In contrast, hundreds of other localized molecules impacted synaptic strengthening only if disrupted within a few minutes of a memory's formation. To test his hypothesis in live animals, he teamed up with Fenton, who worked at SUNY Downstate at the time and had experience training lab animals and running behavioral experiments. In 2006, the duo published their first paper showing that blocking PKMζ could erase rats' memories a day or a month after they had formed. This suggested that the persistent activity of PKMζ is required to maintain a memory. PKMζ seemed like a sweeping explanation for how memories form and are maintained at the molecular level. Other researchers genetically engineered mice to lack PKMζ, and in 2013, two independent studies showed that these mice could still form memories. In 2016, they published a rebuttal, demonstrating that in the absence of PKMζ, mice recruit a backup mechanism, involving another molecule, to strengthen synapses. “The biological system is not such that you lose one molecule and everything goes. It would take Sacktor and Fenton nearly another decade to find out. They developed a new molecule to inhibit the activity of PKMζ. “I suggested that it worked by blocking the PKMζ's interaction with KIBRA,” recalled Wayne Sossin, a neuroscientist at McGill. Like an anchor, it holds other proteins in place inside a synapse. “It's not a protein that a lot of people work on,” Sossin said, but there is considerable “independent evidence that KIBRA has something to do with memory”—and even that it is associated with PKMζ. Most research has focused on KIBRA's role in cancer. “In the nervous system,” he said, “there are only three or four of us [studying it].” Sacktor and Fenton joined them. André Fenton and his team found that an interaction between two proteins is key to keeping memory intact over time. To find out if KIBRA and PKMζ work together in response to synaptic activity, the researchers used a technique that makes interacting proteins glow. When they applied electrical pulses to hippocampal slices, glowing dots of evidence appeared: Following bursts of synaptic activity that produced long-term synaptic strengthening, a multitude of KIBRA-PKMζ complexes formed, and they were persistent. This suggested that the interaction between KIBRA and PKMζ is crucial not only for forming memories, but also for keeping them intact over time. The KIBRA and PKMζ proteins stabilize each other by forming a bond. That way, when a protein degrades and needs to be replaced, the other remains in place. Individually, PKMζ and KIBRA don't last a lifetime—but by binding to each other, they help ensure your memories might. “There had to be a very, very interesting answer, an elegant answer, for how this could come about,” Fenton said. “And that elegant answer is the KIBRA-PKMζ interacting story.” This work also answers a question that researchers had put on the shelf. Sacktor's earlier study showed that increasing levels of PKMζ strengthened synapses and memories. If true, this would help explain how only the specific synapses involved in a particular physical memory trace are strengthened, when a neuron may have thousands of synapses that connect it to various other cells. However, he cautioned that this doesn't necessarily translate to maintaining memory because synaptic strengthening is not the only model for how memory works. Glanzman's own past research on sea slugs at first appeared to show that disrupting a molecule analogous to PKMζ erases memory. “Originally, I said it was erased,” Glanzman said, “but later experiments showed we could bring the memory back.” These findings prompted him to reconsider whether memory is truly stored as changes in the strength of synaptic connections. Glanzman, who has worked for 40 years under the synaptic model, is a recent proponent of an alternative view called the molecular-encoding model, which posits that molecules inside a neuron store memories. While he has no doubt that synaptic strengthening follows memory formation, and that PKMζ plays a major role in this process, he remains unsure if the molecule also stores the memory itself. Still, Glanzman emphasized that this study addresses some of the challenges of the synaptic model, such as molecular turnover and synapse targeting, by “providing evidence that KIBRA and PKMζ form a complex that is synapse-specific and persists longer than either individual molecule.” Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.

I say it's wrong because months ago I heard arguments that models predicted that lowering the curve could also reduce total mortality. And I linked to that video to give evidence that this was part of the general discussion months ago.The fact that you disagree with that model, or argue that I need to give a stronger evidence for the current information we have, has no bearing on my point.Eg, when you write "I don't believe this is the situation right now" - that statement is based on knowledge you have now, not knowledge that people had on "day 1".

Nowadays it seems both EU & US hasn't pursued heavy suppression (probably too costly, and legally and culturally difficult), but rather just hoping to keep it somewhat under control until a vaccine comes, hopefully.
