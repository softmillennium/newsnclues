Footage shows animal leaping over wall in Lahore before attack that left victims with face and arm injuries

The owners of a pet lion that escaped from a farmhouse and injured a woman and her two children in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore have been arrested, authorities said on Sunday.

The arrest came after dramatic video footage emerged showing the lion leaping over a wall and attacking the victims in a residential area.

Faisal Kamran, a police official, said the woman and her five- and seven-year-old children sustained injuries to their faces and arms on Wednesday night when the lion escaped from its cage.

According to a police report, the children's father said the lion's owners had stood by and watched as the animal clawed at his family, making no effort to restrain it. The lion later returned to the owners' farmhouse and was relocated to a wildlife park, police said.

Keeping exotic animals such as lions is considered a status symbol by some wealthy Pakistanis, despite the legal requirements and high fees associated with ownership.

In Turkey, a lion that escaped from a theme park near the resort of Antalya was shot dead on Sunday after attacking a man, the local governor and media reports said.

The lion, reportedly named Zeus, escaped his enclosure at the Land of Lions animal theme park in Manavgat, about 40 miles (65km) east of Antalya, in the early hours of the morning, the governor said.

According to the BirGün newspaper, the lion attacked an agricultural worker called Suleiman Kir who was asleep in a pistachio field with his wife. Kir tussled with the lion before it ran off. He was injured but not badly and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.

“We were covered with blankets to protect ourselves from mosquitoes and when the prayer call sounded, I tried to stand up but I couldn't,” he told the newspaper. “Suddenly I felt something touch my left foot and when I eventually managed to get up, I saw it was something huge – I thought it was a dog.”

In a video posted online, he described the moments wrestling with the lion. “We called for help but there was no one around. As the lion was biting my calf and my neck, I grabbed him around the neck and began to squeeze and he backed off. At that moment, the security forces came,” he said. “If I had not been strong, I wouldn't be here right now.”

Antalya's governor said the lion had been tracked down and shot dead. “It was not possible to catch the escaped lion alive because it posed a danger to people and the environment, so it was shot,” he said.

He indicated that an investigation had been opened into the incident. BirGün said there were about 30 big cats at the Land of Lions.

Lando Norris won a chaotic British Grand Prix on Sunday, safely navigating a rain-hit race punctuated by several safety cars and taking advantage of his teammate Oscar Piastri incurring a 10-second penalty when one of those safety cars pulled off the track.
    


            Norris only led for the last few laps at Silverstone, having remained largely anonymous for much of the race.
    


            It was Piastri who set the pace almost all afternoon until his challenge was undone when he slammed on the brakes too forcefully as the safety car peeled off and picked up a 10-second penalty from the stewards.
    


            That left Norris as the winner-elect, providing he could complete the race cleanly – a difficult task in the inclement weather conditions that caused several drivers to lose control and spin off the track.
    


            “It's beautiful,” he told broadcaster Sky Sports afterward. “Everything I dreamed of, I guess. Everything I have ever wanted to achieve. Apart from a championship, I think this is as good as it gets in terms of feelings, in terms of achievement, being proud, all of it.
    


            “This is where it all started for me, was actually watching you on TV many years ago. And now, thankfully, I've been able to have my go.”
    


            By finishing first, Norris closed the gap to Piastri in the drivers' world championship and is now only eight points behind his teammate.
    


            Piastri held on for second while Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg claimed his first ever F1 podium in his 239th race, despite starting in 19th on the grid.
    


            “Nico, Nico, Nico,” his team shouted as they mobbed him afterwards, finally celebrating a podium for the German driver who holds the record for the most races completed without ever finishing in the top three.
    


            “What a race, coming from virtually last,” he told Sky Sports. “It's pretty surreal, to be honest. Not sure how it all happened, but obviously crazy conditions, mixed conditions. It was a survival fight for a lot of the race.”
    


            From the very start, it was an action-packed race with Mercedes' George Russell and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc among those pitting to change their tires before the race began.
    


            On pole, Max Verstappen started cleanly but, behind him, Liam Lawson and Esteban Ocon collided, sending Lawson spinning off the track and causing a virtual safety car to be deployed.
    


            As soon as that virtual safety car ended, another one started when Gabriel Bortoleto had to abandon his car as he tried to limp back to the pits. Once that one finished, and the racing got going, Verstappen and Piastri battled for first place – Verstappen ducking and weaving all over the track to defend his position, though ultimately Piastri passed the Red Bull driver relatively easily.
    


            Rain began falling shortly afterwards and, after complaining about his tires not gripping the track, Verstappen slid wide, letting Norris through as well. All top three drivers pitted shortly afterward but Norris endured a slow pit stop, conceding second place back to Verstappen.
    


            The rain got heavier, the cars kicked up so much spray, and the conditions deteriorated so much that a full safety car was deployed.
    


            Then, as the race got back underway, visibility remained so poor that Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar accidentally drove into the back of Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli, crumpling the Frenchman's car and causing yet another safety car to come out.
    


            Led by Piastri, with Verstappen close behind, the drivers bunched up again. As the safety car began pulling off, Piastri started trying to outfox Verstappen but he braked so sharply that the Dutchman accidentally overtook him. Then, Piastri accelerated away and Verstappen spun out trying to match the Australian, slipping from second to 10th place.
    


            The stewards noted the controversial incident and hit the McLaren driver with the penalty that cost him the race.
    


            “I'm not going to say much. I'll get myself in trouble. Well done to Nico, I think that's the highlight of the day,” Piastri told Sky Sports. “Apparently you can't brake behind the safety car anymore.”
    


            Although Piastri remained running out front, his days as the race leader were numbered as he was unable to build up an advantage of more than 10 seconds over Norris. Eventually, McLaren pitted him and Norris took the lead, becoming tearful over the radio when he won his home race.
    


            Verstappen moved himself back up and finished in fifth place while Lewis Hamilton finished in fourth.

Real Madrid's FIFA Club World Cup quarter-final against Borussia Dortmund had taken three crazy turns during nine minutes of second-half stoppage time when Marcel Sabitzer chested the ball and sent a right-footed volley toward Thibaut Courtois' post.

Courtois leapt to his right, extended the long arm on his 2m frame and just managed to get his gloved fingertips on the ball, knocking it down.

Courtois hit the ground as the ball bounded up. He looked skyward, planted his right hand to regain his balance, grabbed the ball with both hands on the second bounce and fell onto it with his chest.

Sabitzer turned his back to the goal and put both hands on his head as Brazilian referee Ramon Abatti walked by, raised both hands and blew the final whistle.

“In football, it's like this. All the teams that are here, they compete until the end,” Courtois said after Real's 3-2 victory on Saturday. “A game could become like this at any minute, and that's what happened at the end.”

Voted the top goalkeeper in 2018, Courtois has won a pair of UEFA Champions League titles with Real Madrid, along with two English Premier League championships and four in La Liga. 

“We are so lucky that we have Thibaut on goal because Thibaut is one of those ‘keepers that makes you win games, and today that save has been so decisive,” Madrid coach Xabi Alonso said.

Gonzalo Garcia and Fran Garcia scored in the first 20 minutes as Real Madrid built a 2-0 lead. Gonzalo Garcia is tying Benfica's Angel Di Maria and Al Hilal's Marcos Leonardo for the tournament lead with four goals.

“Not even in my best dreams did I think it would go this well,” said the 21-year-old Gonzalo Garcia, who played just five La Liga matches over the past two seasons.

Real Madrid's lead still stood when five minutes of stoppage time were signaled.

Dortmund's Maximilian Beier started the zaniness when he scored three minutes into stoppage time after Antonio Rudiger's failed clearance.

Kylian Mbappe, who entered in the 67th minute, restored a two-goal lead one minute later with a spectacular bicycle kick, beating goalkeeper Gregor Kobel from 6 yards from Arda Guler's long cross. 

Mbappe then held up two fingers with his right hand and formed a zero with his left as a tribute to Diogo Jota, flashing the No. 20 of the Liverpool player who died in a car crash on Thursday.

That was not all.

Serhou Guirassy converted a penalty kick in the eighth minute of added time after he was fouled by Dean Huijsen, who received a red card and would miss the semi-final.

Dortmund pushed for an equalizer. Courtois then came up with a stop for the ages.

“It is a great big save. That's the reason why he is the best goalkeeper in the world,” Dortmund coach Niko Kovac said.

Madrid advanced to a semi-final match against Champions League winner Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, a day after Chelsea meets the Brazilian club Fluminense.

“The nervousness, we need to learn to be more calm in the next game and finish the game in possession,” Courtois said.



                                                                                Spain are the favorites to win the UEFA Women's Euro 2025, but star player Aitana Bonmati's illness ahead of the tournament raises another question mark around a side which, despite their obvious quality, are not unstoppable. 
Having claimed the last two Ballon d'Or awards, Barcelona midfielder Bonmati is the game's biggest star at present, so her absence in the final days before the start of Euro 2025 is a major setback. 
The 27-year-old came down with a fever in training last week, and was subsequently hospitalized and diagnosed with viral meningitis. 
Bonmati was discharged on Sunday and joined up with                                    


HSIEH ADVANCES:
                                        In the women's doubles, Taiwan's Hsieh Su-wei was to play in the second round last night, but Taiwan's Ray Ho exited in the men's doubles                                        It is more than 10 years since Grigor Dimitrov reached his sole Wimbledon semi-final and back then it still seemed a reasonable bet that the Bulgarian once dubbed “Baby Federer” would win a Grand Slam title.
There were semi-final runs at the US Open and Australian Open after that, but it has never quite happened and despite him still being ranked No. 21, it most likely never will.
Dimitrov, 34, remains one of the most stylish players on the circuit though, with his elegant single-handed backhand and smooth all-court game a rare reminder of how tennis was before the power merchants turned                                    


TAIWANESE WIN:
                                        Chan Hao-ching and Wu Fang-hsien and their partners won their first-round matches in the women's doubles at the All England Lawn Tennis Club                                        Late-night finishes and five-set matches are becoming a habit for Taylor Fritz at Wimbledon this year.
On Wednesday, he wrapped up his win over Gabriel Diallo before the match was suspended — making sure the fifth-seeded American would not have to come back on court for a fourth straight day.
Fritz overcame a bloodied elbow to win 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/0), 4-6, 6-3 on No. 1 Court a day after he finished off another five-set win over Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in a match that was halted on Monday at about 10:15pm after Fritz forced a fifth set with Wimbledon's 11pm curfew looming.
He

Cole Palmer put Chelsea ahead in the 16th minute, but Estevao, an 18-year-old who is to transfer to Chelsea this summer, tied the score against his future club with an angled shot in the 53rd.
Gusto's shot following a short corner kick appeared to deflect off defender Agustin Giay and goalkeeper Weverton and sent the Chelsea portion of 65,782 fans into a frenzy. FIFA credited Weverton with an

Desire Doue scored in the 78th minute, and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) moved a step closer to another trophy with a 2-0 victory over Bayern Munich in the quarter-final of the FIFA Club World Cup on Saturday, a game marred by a gruesome injury to young German star Jamal Musiala.

With PSG two men down after a pair of late red cards and Bayern throwing everyone forward, Ousmane Dembele added an insurance goal deep into stoppage time to send the French powerhouse to the semi-finals on Wednesday against Real Madrid following their 3-2 win over Borussia Dortmund.

Dembele, whose goal was set up by Achraf Hakimi's brilliant dribbling through five Bayern defenders, celebrated by sitting with his legs crossed to honor Liverpool player Diogo Jota, who was killed along with his brother in a car wreck early on Thursday. A moment of silence was held before the opening kick.

PSG, who claimed their first UEFA Champions League title with a 5-0 rout of Inter Milan five weeks ago, broke a scoreless deadlock when Joao Neves stole the ball from Harry Kane near the halfway line to send the French team sprinting toward the Bayern goal.

Neves got the ball back off a give-and-go and found Doue lurking just outside the top of the area. His left-footed shot caught Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer flat-footed as it skidded inside the right post.

However, PSG had to hold on for dear life to preserve the win after Willian Pacho and Lucas Hernandez were both sent off with red cards. Pacho was called for a reckless challenge, and Hernandez earned a red for doling out an elbow.

Bayern had two apparent goals flagged for offside, including a header by Kane. In the waning seconds, the German club was awarded a penalty kick, only to have it waved off after a video assistant referee review.

However, Musiala's sickening injury marred the outcome.

As he chased a loose ball near the end line in first-half stoppage time, PSG ‘keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma darted off his spot and dived for it — only to crash into the left ankle of the 22-year-old German. As Musiala rolled over, his foot dangled awkwardly, the ankle appearing to be cleanly broken.

Donnarumma walked away with the ball, but he knelt down in horror when he looked back and realized the seriousness of the injury. A stretcher was immediately summoned to take Musiala off the field.

Both teams walked toward the locker rooms in stunned silence, with the PSG ‘keeper appearing to be close to tears. He was booed throughout the second half by Bayern fans each time he touched the ball.

Bayern coach Vincent Kompany expressed outrage at the injury after the game. “I've rarely been so angry at half-time, not against my players. There's many things in life that are important, much more important than this, but in the end, for these guys, it's their life,” Kompany said.

“Someone like Jamal lives for this, and he came back from a setback, and then it happens in the way it happens and you feel powerless,” he said. 

“When I'm sat here next to you now, the thing that gets my blood still boiling at the moment, it's not the result. I understand this is football, but it's the fact that it happened to someone who, one, enjoys the game so much but also very important for us,” he added.



                                                                                Spain are the favorites to win the UEFA Women's Euro 2025, but star player Aitana Bonmati's illness ahead of the tournament raises another question mark around a side which, despite their obvious quality, are not unstoppable.

Older adults with vitamin B12 levels currently considered normal may still face cognitive decline and brain damage, according to a new study.

Participants with lower—yet technically acceptable—B12 levels showed measurable brain white matter damage and slower cognitive processing, prompting researchers to call for a reevaluation of what constitutes “healthy” B12 levels in aging populations.

The death toll from flash floods that rampaged through Central Texas rose to at least 67 on Sunday as rescuers maneuvering through challenging terrain found more bodies and continued their desperate search for many others, including 11 missing girls from a summer camp.

Searchers in Kerr County have found 16 bodies since Saturday afternoon, bringing the total number of dead there to 59, said Sheriff Larry Leitha. The dead included 21 children, he said.

He pledged to keep searching in that Hill Country region until “everybody is found” from Friday's flash floods.

Four deaths also were reported in Travis County, three in Burnet and 1 in Kendall.

Rescuers scoured a central Texas landscape of mangled trees, overturned cars and muck-filled debris on Sunday in an increasingly bleak mission to locate survivors after a historic flash flood.

Rescuers dealt with broken trees, overturned cars and muck-filled debris in the difficult task to find survivors. Authorities still have not said how many people were missing beyond the 11 children and a camp counselor from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp.

Families were allowed to look around the camp Sunday morning while nearby crews operating heavy equipment pulled tree trunks and tangled branches out of the water as they searched along a riverbank. Thunder rumbled from a new storm.

A woman and a teenage girl, both wearing rubber waders, briefly went inside one of the cabins, which stood next to a pile of soaked mattresses, a storage trunk and clothes. At one point, the pair doubled over, sobbing before they embraced.

With each passing hour, the outlook of finding more survivors became even more bleak. Volunteers and some families of the missing who drove to the disaster zone searched the riverbanks despite being asked not to do so.

Authorities faced growing questions about whether enough warnings were issued in area long vulnerable to flooding and whether enough preparations were made.

The destructive, fast-moving waters rose eight metres on the river in only 45 minutes before daybreak Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as flash flood watches remained in effect and more rain fell in central Texas on Sunday.

Searchers used helicopters, boats and drones to look for victims and to rescue people stranded in trees and from camps isolated by washed-out roads. Officials said more than 850 people were rescued in the first 36 hours.

Govenor Greg Abbott vowed that authorities will work around the clock and said new areas were being searched as the water receded. He declared Sunday a day of prayer for the state.

“I urge every Texan to join me in prayer this Sunday – for the lives lost, for those still missing, for the recovery of our communities, and for the safety of those on the front lines,” he said in a statement.

In Rome, Pope Leo XIV offered special prayers for those touched by the disaster. History's first American pope spoke in English at the end of his Sunday noon blessing, “I would like to express sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones, in particular their daughters who were in summer camp, in the disaster caused by the flooding of the Guadalupe River in Texas in the United States. We pray for them.”

The hills along the Guadalupe River are dotted with century-old youth camps and campgrounds where generations of families have come to swim and enjoy the outdoors. The area is especially popular around the Independence Day holiday, making it more difficult to know how many are missing.

“We don't even want to begin to estimate at this time,” Kerrville city manager Dalton Rice said on Saturday.

Survivors shared terrifying stories of being swept away and clinging to trees as rampaging floodwaters carried trees and cars past them. Others fled to attics inside their homes, praying the water wouldn't reach them.

At Camp Mystic, a cabin full of girls held onto a rope strung by rescuers as they walked across a bridge with water whipping around their legs.

Among those confirmed dead were an eight-year-old girl from Mountain Brook, Alabama, who was at Camp Mystic, and the director of another camp up the road.

Locals know the area as “flash flood alley” but the flooding in the middle of the night caught many campers and residents by surprise even though there were warnings.

The National Weather Service on Thursday advised of potential flooding and then sent out a series of flash flood warnings in the early hours of Friday before issuing flash flood emergencies – a rare alert notifying of imminent danger.

At the Mo-Ranch Camp in the community of Hunt, officials had been monitoring the weather and opted to move several hundred campers and attendees at a church youth conference to higher ground. At nearby Camps Rio Vista and Sierra Vista, organizers also had mentioned on social media that they were watching the weather the day before ending their second summer session Thursday.

Authorities and elected officials have said they did not expect such an intense downpour, the equivalent of months' worth of rain for the area.

U.S. Representative Chip Roy, whose district includes the ravaged area, acknowledged that there would be second-guessing and finger-pointing as people look for someone to blame.

No matter the strategy, the goal is the same: avoid potential federal audits, funding cuts, and closures.

This story was published in partnership between The 19th and The 74, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news site covering education in America. It was originally reported by Jo Napolitano of The 74. Meet Jo and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.

Schools and other organizations serving undocumented students are taking their activities underground, fearful of revealing all they do to help newcomers navigate life in America — lest they be targeted and shuttered by the Trump administration.

Some have asked staff to use secure messaging systems like Signal instead of text and email to keep sensitive conversations from public reach. Others say such discussions should happen only over the phone. 

A few are reconsidering the distribution of once-standard know-your-rights cards, afraid they could overstep some unclear federal boundary about immigration enforcement, while others are scrubbing the names and locations of their sites from the internet. 

No matter the strategy, the goal is the same: avoid federal audits, funding cuts and closures that could be prompted by their work with undocumented students and families, but also the administration's edict against diversity, equity and inclusion.

“Because of the threats from the federal administration about revoking the 501(c)(3) status of nonprofits, we want to keep ourselves from being targeted,” said one man who asked not to be identified because he works for an organization that serves undocumented youth. 

Groups like his can lose their IRS status, which allows them to collect tax-deductible donations, if they engage in political activities. For this reason, he said, they are carefully policing staff members' speech in public and in private. Political discussions or commentary on social media are forbidden. 

“Anything that could be perceived as obstructing or challenging federal immigration policies, we don't put in writing,” he said. “Anything that could be seen as a criticism of the administration — or anything that could be seen as partisan — we're going to completely avoid.”

An administrator for a small Illinois school district that serves mostly Hispanic children said that while it still provides help to all families — including connecting them to rental and tax-preparation assistance — staff are more guarded about publicizing their efforts. Any high-profile association between the school and these types of services can be a flag to their families' immigration status. 

“We're not trying to draw attention,” she said, asking that she not be identified in order to protect her students. “I don't want any light shining on our district.”

Her fears around immigration were heightened in February, she said, when she received two letters addressed to her office from the Department of Homeland Security, asking for the whereabouts of two children. 

“I ignored them,” she said. “I just pretended like it didn't happen. I did not respond in terms of providing the information and so far, nobody has followed up.”

Those early efforts took place just weeks after President Donald Trump returned to office and are among the administration's first known attempts to target and locate undocumented children. Reports of federal agents undertaking welfare checks on young immigrants who crossed the border unaccompanied did not surface until months later. 

Some of those visits have led to their parents being detained and, in some cases, arrested. Hundreds of kids, their caretakers hauled away, have been placed in government custody in recent months. 

Many schools, including the one in Illinois, are curbing the use of words like “diversity” and “equity,” in all their communications. They're worried they could be accused of obstructing the law: Trump has likened the use of these terms — “inclusion” among them — to a type of indoctrination he will stamp out by withholding the offending group's funding. These schools and advocacy organizations are also barring staff from participating in protests or rallies related to immigration — or student detainment. 

And they said school-sponsored events, like a normally well-attended spring family night for the parents of English learners, have been nearly empty — or worse, cancelled — since Trump took office and immigrants avoid large gatherings. 

Catherine Lhamon, executive director of The Edley Center on Law & Democracy at the University of California, Berkeley, argued that now is not the time to retreat. Lhamon, the head of the Education Department's civil rights division during both the Obama and Biden administrations, said efforts to avoid Trump's dragnet have proven futile. 

“The impulse to keep your head down and hope that you will escape notice has been demonstrably ineffective during the first months of the Trump administration,” she said. “Fulfilling your mission, doing the things that took you to this work, standing for your principles, that's what each of us should do.”

Lhamon said, too, that discouraging staff from speaking out publicly in defense of their students erodes the bond between the two. 

“It also strikes at the core component of schooling, that is to teach people how to think critically, how to question authority,” she said. “That is the function of schooling. Curtailing that is a mistake.”

And while Trump has threatened Harvard University with the loss of its 501(c)(3) status, the Nonprofit Alliance notes his powers are limited, though House Republicans are seeking their expansion. 

Whether Trump's threats are idle or actual, their impact has changed how immigrant-focused entities operate. 

Barbara Marler, a long-time educator-turned-consultant in Illinois, has worked with newcomer students for decades. She's now offering school districts and other education-focused clients the option of combing through their records to find and erase any DEI-related terms an AI bot could flag as troublesome. 

Such wording could trigger Freedom of Information requests that Marler described as “nefarious” and one school administrator, already inundated by them, deemed harassment.

“Never, in my career of over 40 years, have I felt the need to do this,” said Marler, adding that a majority of school districts in vocal, right-leaning communities feel compelled to adopt these precautions. “They want to do right by their [English learners], but are worried that legal challenges would bankrupt them in the worst-case scenario — or board meeting harassment would be triggered in the best-case scenario.”

Alejandra Vázquez Baur, a fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and director of the National Newcomer Network, notes most of the people who work for organizations that serve immigrants want to draw attention to children and families who've historically been cast aside.

“We know exactly what it feels like to feel ostracized by a system that was not built for us,” she said. “We come into this work to amend that. And so the reality of the situation at this moment is heartbreaking. We do not join these fields to mince our words and hide our intentions.”

Some groups, including those that operate inside immigrant-friendly states or cities, with big budgets and robust legal defense, might feel emboldened to push back, she said. But small organizations, particularly those run by immigrants, who might themselves be undocumented or whose staff have mixed status, can't afford that risk. 

Trump himself was forced to close his own 501(c)(3), a private foundation established in 1987, as part of a 2018 settlement after his family was found to have used money earmarked for charity to further the president's political campaign. Trump, who was ordered to pay $2 million in damages, called the investigation “harassment.” 

Antero Godina Garcia, professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Education, said even a public retreat in name only by those groups that serve immigrants marks a loss for the community. He worries that it will shrink these organizations' reach and the families they assist will have fewer places where their identities are recognized and affirmed.

“It is not just less services and opportunities for these communities, but also a broader erosion of how individuals can see themselves as valued within the social fabric of this country,” he said. 

But the man who works for the organization serving undocumented youth, who voiced concern about preserving its tax-exempt status, said it's difficult to determine what types of comments or activities are considered over the line by the Trump administration. 

“It gets complicated because things that we think are normal and are legal, such as offering know-your-rights training, the administration could easily perceive that as obstructing their policies, making them hostile to us,” he said. 

As for the written footprint, Marler, who has attended numerous conferences on how best to serve multilingual learners, has observed a telling shift in the types of in-class translating applications marketed to teachers. These tools were long promoted for their ability to keep records, allowing educators to go back and examine communications over time to learn more about students and families. 

Now, Marler said, those same companies are marketing privacy. 

“One of their top-selling points was there was no record of the material that was translated,” she said — so communications couldn't be subpoenaed or subjected to public records requests. “Now, that is their sales point.”

Forest protectors are defending mature forests from logging after dam removal and restoration on the Elwha River.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

Standing at the edge of the Aldwell Forest clearcut just above the Elwha River in Washington State, the Murphy Company's devastation of the landscape slaps you in the face. Here on land owned by the state's Department of Natural Resources (DNR), a beautiful mature forest has been logged for hardwood, plywood, and other wood products. Hacked-off stumps are visible in all directions, a few trees left to stand. The former forest floor, once rich with organisms and nutrients that fed life, now stands heaped into huge slash piles to be burned. The land doused with herbicide to kill any competitors to Douglas fir seedlings that will become a new tree plantation monoculture.

The contrast with the remaining intact Elwha legacy forests, located nearby in the watershed, couldn't be starker. There, in naturally regenerated forests more than a century old, large Douglas fir, western red cedar and big-leaf maple trees festooned with moss and licorice ferns surround you. Native sword ferns, trillium, salal, red huckleberry, lichen, and other native vegetation in multiple shades of brilliant green abound.

After DNR put more Elwha legacy forest on the chopping block during a November 2024 auction, environmentalists, citizens, and forest defenders are fighting to stop Murphy's logging there through lawsuits and direct action.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

For over a month, a tree-sit launched by a grouping called the Olympic Forest Defenders (OFD) blocked the road into the Parched forest site scheduled for destruction. The sit received broad support through encampments, rallies, and continuous supply efforts from community members. After a judge refused to extend an injunction against logging, police and violent vigilantes attacked the sit and encampment. The OFD made a decision to end the tree-sit on June 15 for the safety of those involved.

“Our commitment to defend the forests and waters of the Olympic Peninsula remains strong,” states an OFD press release. “To the vigilantes, the DNR cops, and state-sponsored repression, we say: You did not dig up our roots. We are still here. Stop pillaging our people. Stop pillaging our forests. Stop pillaging our waters. Our movement has not been uprooted. It is just beginning to grow.”

The Elwha River runs out of the protected Olympic National Park. It is the pulsing heart of the ancestral homelands of the Lower Elwha Klallam tribe. Two large hydropower dams, the Elwha and Glines Canyon, were built on the river between 1910 and 1927 to fuel timber processing and industry in the Port Angeles area. The dam builder didn't bother to include legally required mechanisms for fish passage.

The dams blocked the free-flowing river, flooding tribal village and cultural sites and decimating the tribe's way of life. Ninety-three percent of the upstream salmon spawning habitat was cut off, leading to near extirpation of pristine populations of wild salmon in the river that was central to the Lower Elwha people's life and culture. Before the dams, the Elwha was famous for its enormous chinook salmon, precious to the tribe and a primary food source for orca whales of the Salish Sea.

Tribal elders passed down to their children and grandchildren the stories of the river filled with fish before the dams. Under tribal pressure that spanned generations, a $325 million project was launched in 2011 by tribal, governmental, and academic agencies and scientists to restore the river ecosystem by removing the dams; restoring the river's flow; planting native plants; and building back the populations of five species of Pacific salmon, steelhead, and other species. The dams were finally taken down in the years between 2011 and 2014 — more than 20 years after a 1992 Congressional Act ordered it.

The project has been an inspiring success in restoring the anadromous fish populations and the ecosystem, as well as a source of pride for the Lower Elwha people. The river returned to natural channels after dam removal, and after a few years of major sediment release, it began to clear. The released sediment rebuilt the delta and estuary at the Elwha mouth on the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which is critical to rearing juvenile migrating fish.

But new logging of forests on the hills just above the river represents an assault on the restoration efforts that have been achieved. It also explains the deep feelings held among tribal members, Forest Defenders, conservationists, and others who care about the land and river ecosystem.

A petition circulated in October 2024 by Lower Elwha tribe members and signed by over half of the members of the tribe, as well as 2,500 other people, states that,

We do not understand a way of thinking that would spend hundreds of millions on Elwha River restoration but continue to industrially log in that same watershed. We do not understand a way of thinking that takes too much and says it is never enough; that would disrespect a River that gives us so much life and now hope.

Our ancestral knowledge and sacred obligation to the natural world teaches us a different path. We have inherent and treaty protected rights in these lands as our usual and accustomed gathering areas. Together, we call for the protection of the Elwha Watershed as a commitment to our mutual future and to the wellbeing of all who depend upon it. We ask you to stop these planned timber sales and heed our call to be guided by principles of respect and reciprocity in caring for the watershed.

The DNR's November 2024 auction of the now-threatened Elwha forests to the Murphy Company were among others the DNR Board of Resources rushed through in apparent anticipation of new Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove taking office in January 2025. Upthegrove had pledged to protect legacy forests if elected.

The Tree Well and Parched logging plans threaten to cut over 300 acres of mature legacy conifer forest, some of which has never been logged. Two lawsuits were filed to overturn the sales in December 2024 by the Earth Law Center (ELC) in conjunction with the Orca Network, the Center for Whale Research, and the Legacy Forest Defense Coalition (LFDC).

The lawsuits lay out a coherent, detailed picture of the damage new logging would cause to the river ecosystem. The ELC suit alleges that the DNR is violating the state Public Lands and Environmental Policy Acts by failing to perform an adequate environmental assessment of the logging's impact on mature, structurally complex, and biodiverse forests. The two forest sites are critical to carbon sequestration and as habitat for wildlife and culturally significant native plants.

The lawsuit also argues scientific studies have shown logging negatively impacts stream flows, hydrology, and water temperature — all factors critical to supporting the Elwha system and its salmon populations, which in turn support populations of the critically endangered southern resident orcas.

The groups' also charge that logging on steep slopes in these sites above the Elwha and its tributaries threatens slope stability, pointing out the potential impact to Port Angeles's water supply.

LFCD is suing for injunctive relief against the sale of the forests on the basis that the DNR is neglecting to follow its own policies to regenerate old-growth forest on 10-15 percent of state forestlands — a legal approach that has successfully paused other DNR timber sales.

The LFDC's Kyle Krakow told Truthout in an emailed statement that the group has “appealed a total of 32 sales in lawsuits that are still ongoing in most cases. Collectively, these timber sales threaten over 2,300 acres of biodiverse and carbon-dense legacy forests across western Washington.”

Truthout also spoke to LaTrisha Suggs, a restoration planner for, and enrolled member of, the Jamestown S'Klallam tribe. Her family has lived for time immemorial in Clallam County. Suggs is also a Port Angeles City Council member who worked as a restoration planner for the Lower Elwha tribe on the river restoration project.

In a declaration filed in support of the LFDC lawsuit, Suggs stated that,

The sites of many of the proposed and sold parcels have steep slopes, and the levels of logging that occurs has an impact on the potential for landslides, particularly with the impacts of climate change and increased rain events in Port Angeles. When landslides occur, because the trees can no longer hold back the soil due to clear cutting, the soil runs into the streams and rivers, blocking access to salmon and impacting water quality. The soils of mature forests act as storage for water that the plant communities rely on during the summer months.

Her declaration also stated that Port Angeles has been under a stage three water shortage each summer since 2022, and Clallam County has been under a drought advisory for years — issues expected to get worse as climate change advances.

Elizabeth Dunne is ELC's director of legal advocacy. She lives near the Elwha River and co-founded the Elwha Legacy Forest Coalition (ELF) after DNR sanctioned logging on the Aldwell forest. Dunne and the coalition's successful efforts to stop a prior timber sale in the Elwha has been told in an award-winning short film, Last Stand, Saving the Elwha River's Legacy Forests.

She shared a map with Truthout showing that greater than 50 percent of the Elwha's legacy forests have been logged in just the last 17 years; little older forest remains in the Elwha watershed. Now DNR has plans for logging 800 more acres.

“The Elwha River is really speaking for many of these ecosystems that are suffering at the hands of over-extraction and exploitation for profit without having any kind of sense of responsibility of the balance that we need to show back to the Earth if we are going to continue to survive as a species. And not just survive but be able to thrive,” Dunne said. “Imagine a world where we can go fishing, where we have abundant ecosystems, and they're not all controlled and commodified, and we're able to, sustain ourselves.”

In early May, Murphy began building roads into the Parched timber units, tearing down trees and bringing in gravel. In response, on May 7 the Olympic Forest Defenders began their tree-sit, blocking the road into the Parched site off U.S. Highway 101.

The Forest Defenders demanded an immediate cancellation of the Parched timber sale, a pause on all logging in the Elwha watershed, and a permanent ban on logging the remaining mature forests in western Washington.

The tree-sit involved a cable pulley stretched from logs and other debris blocking the middle of the logging road connected to a “dunk tank”-type platform 60-80 feet up a nearby large grand fir tree. Cutting the cable would cause the sitter on the platform to come crashing down.

Truthout was able to visit and speak there and on the phone with “Fable,” a 25-year-old tree-sitter, about the goals of the tree-sit and why they were participating. “There's a long history in the Pacific Northwest of direct action and tree-sitting being effective, especially when done in conjunction with some sort of legal pressure,” Fable told Truthout.

They told Truthout they had grown up a timber farm and helped manage it with their parents. The family would talk about the impact of logging on the land and the creeks, and Fable would go salmon fishing with their dad and uncles, learning about the connection between forests, rivers, and salmon.

Fable told Truthout that they had studied math to get a master's degree, but their recent experience of caretaking for a loved one who was sick changed their life. The experience “made me want to be more involved in things that actually make change in the world,” they said. “Realistically, the most good you can do is caring for people and caring for land, and keeping people and land safe from the really evil things that are out there.”

Rallies were held at the Parched site, and for over a month community members from around the region continuously brought in supplies and camped to protect the sitter. DNR officers initially surrounded the tree, running generator-powered lights around the clock before backing off. They would at times try to stop people from going in or threaten them with arrest.

“The support's been great and kind of surprising,” Fable said. “People understand how critical of a moment this is and that this kind of action is necessary, which really gives me a lot of hope because that's how I feel. And to not just be a lone person doing something like this is just really, really cool.”

After the tree-sit began, Land Commissioner Upthegrove, who placed a six-month pause on logging legacy forests, condemned the sitters saying, “This stunt is dangerous, reckless and counterproductive…. Their actions put the safety and lives of my employees at risk, and I will seek the prosecution of those involved to the fullest extent of the law. This kind of dangerous vandalism makes it harder to advance a positive environmental agenda.”

The sitters' message, on the other hand, was: “Dave Upthegrove promised to protect mature forests. We are here helping him keep his promise.”

Upthegrove's threats ignited phone calls and emails to his office, including from some who had worked for him because of his campaign pledges. Nonetheless on May 28, he doubled down on threats to the Forest Defenders, saying, “We intend to hold those responsible accountable.”

A statement on DNR's website says Upthegrove is reassessing the process on legacy forests, but that, “Some paused sales could be reconfigured and brought forward to auction once the criteria to exclude structurally complex forests that are critical to carbon storage and habitat biodiversity are developed.” Upthegrove also said he's committed to protect sales approved before he took office, saying, “It's important to defend policies and the authority of the agency.”

It's unclear what DNR will do after the six-month “pause” in legacy forest sales ends. In a letter to Clallam County Democrats, Upthegrove said he intended to bring forward a policy to protect 77,000 acres of older forests, a significant step if done, though less than the 106,000 acres of legacy forest currently unprotected. He claimed, without evidence, that the tree-sit had endangered DNR employees.

After first ordering a two-week injunction against logging and compelling DNR to produce administrative records supporting its decision to approve the timber sales, a Clallam County Superior Court judge refused to extend the injunction past May 23. On June 6, she ruled against an LFDC filing which sought to prevent logging until both lawsuits could receive a full hearing on their merits. Hearings on the merits should be held in coming months.

Dunne told Truthout that she was disappointed in the judge's ruling. “Existing policies aside, what we need today is action commensurate with the gravity of the extinction and biodiversity crisis: a clear directive creating an Ecological Forest Reserve and permanently protecting all remaining legacy forests on state lands for their intrinsic value and as essential to the survival of all species,” she said.

On June 13, police of unknown affiliation swept the camp, seizing supplies and hindering the ability of the encampment to protect the tree-sitter's life. (A DNR spokesperson told Truthout he couldn't comment on the raid of the encampment or the vigilante attacks, only saying DNR had “cleared the many makeshift barricades” on the logging road.) Despite this, the community rallied in support, bringing new supplies and people to keep the sit protected.

Over the next days, violent vigilantes attacked the tree-sit twice. They tampered with the cable and tripod anchoring the platform supporting the tree-sitter, causing it to dangerously dip. Vigilantes also drunkenly threatened to kill the Forest Defenders and threw bottles around. One pointed a gun at Forest Defenders, walking aggressively toward them and then shot into the forest. After this, the Defenders decided to safely evacuate the site before someone was hurt or killed.

At press time, the tree-sit and encampment are gone but the outcome with the threatened forests remains undetermined. Those protecting the forests remain committed to their aims and lawsuits on the merits of the logging remain to be heard.

“Dave Upthegrove ran as a progressive, and that's kind of the first and main legislator we're pushing back against right now. I don't know that we would have done things any different if there weren't these sort of executive orders (like Trump's on timber sales) going into place, and this sort of over-escalation and fascism in our country … and is giving people hope that even under a really threatening administration, we can keep pushing back against it,” Fable told Truthout.

AI in schools isn't progress — it's a sign of how far we've strayed from the purpose of education.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

In April, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon stood onstage at a major ed-tech conference in San Diego and declared with conviction that students across the U.S. would soon benefit from “A1 teaching.” She repeated it over and over — “A1” instead of “AI.” “There was a school system that's going to start making sure that first graders, or even pre-Ks, have A1 teaching every year. That's a wonderful thing!” she assured the crowd.

The moment quickly went viral. Late-night hosts roasted her. A.1. Steak Sauce posted a mock advertisement: “You heard her. Every school should have access to A.1.”

Funny — until it wasn't. Because behind the gaffe was something far more disturbing: The person leading federal education policy wants to replace the emotional and intellectual process of teaching and learning with a mechanical process of content delivery, data extraction, and surveillance masquerading as education.

This is part of a broader agenda being championed by billionaires like Bill Gates. “The A.I.s will get to that ability, to be as good a tutor as any human ever could,” Gates said at a recent conference for investors in educational technology. As one headline bluntly summarized: “Bill Gates says AI will replace doctors, teachers within 10 years.”

This isn't just a forecast, it's a libidinal fantasy — a capitalist dream of replacing relationships with code and scalable software, while public institutions are gutted in the name of “innovation.”

We need to stop pretending that algorithms can think — and we should stop believing that software is intelligent. While using the term “AI” will be necessary to be understood at times, we should begin to introduce and use more accurate language.

And no, I'm not suggesting we start calling it “A1”— unless we're talking about how it's being slathered on everything whether we asked for it or not. What we're calling AI is better understood as Artificial Mimicry: a reflection without thought, articulation without a soul.

Philosopher Raphaël Millière explains that what these systems are doing is not thinking or understanding, but using what he calls “algorithmic mimicry”: sophisticated pattern-matching that mimics human outputs without possessing human cognition. He writes that large pre-trained models like ChatGPT or DALL-E 2 are more like “stochastic chameleons” — not merely parroting back memorized phrases, but blending into the style, tone, and logic of a given prompt with uncanny fluidity. That adaptability is impressive — and can be dangerous — precisely because it can so easily be mistaken for understanding.

So-called AI can be useful in certain contexts. But what we're calling AI in schools today doesn't think, doesn't reason, doesn't understand. It guesses. It copies. It manipulates syntax and patterns based on probability, not meaning. It doesn't teach — it prompts. It doesn't mentor — it manages.

In short, it mimics intelligence. But mimicry is not wisdom. It is not care. It is not pedagogy.

Real learning, as the renowned psychologist Lev Vygotsky showed, is a social process. It happens through dialogue, relationships, and shared meaning-making. Learning unfolds in what Vygotsky called the Zone of Proximal Development — that space between what a learner can do alone and what they can achieve with the guidance of a more experienced teacher, peer, or mentor — someone who can respond with care, ask the right question, and scaffold the next step.

AI can't do that.

It can't sense when a student's silence means confusion or when it means trauma. It can't notice a spark in a student's eyes when they connect a concept to their lived experience. It can't see the brilliance behind a messy, not fully developed idea, or the potential in an unconventional voice. It cannot build a beloved community.

Education entrepreneurs are touting artificial intelligence as the cure for everything from unequal tutoring access to teacher burnout.

It can generate facts, follow-up with questions, offer corrections, give summaries, or suggest next steps — but it can't recognize the emotional weight of confusion or the quiet excitement of an intellectual breakthrough.

That work — the real work of teaching and learning — cannot be automated.

AI tools like Magic School, Perplexity, and School.ai do offer convenience: grammar fixes, sentence rewording, tone improvements. But they also push students toward formulaic, high-scoring answers. AI nudges students toward efficient compliance, not intellectual risk; such tools teach conformity, not originality.

Recently, my son used MagicSchool's AI chatbot, Raina, during one of his sixth grade classes to research his project on Puerto Rico. The appeal was obvious — instant answers, no need to sift through dense texts or multiple websites. But Raina never asked the deeper questions: Why does a nation that calls itself the “land of the free” still hold Puerto Rico as a colony? How do AI systems like itself contribute to the climate crisis that is threatening the future of the island? Raina delivered tidy answers. But raising more complicated questions — and helping students wrestle with the emotional weight of the answers — is the work of a human teacher.

AI can help simplify texts or support writing, but it can also miseducate. Over time, it trains students to mimic what the algorithm deems “effective,” rather than develop their own voice or ideas. Reading becomes extraction, not connection. The soul of literature is lost when reading becomes a mechanical task, not an exchange of ideas and emotions between human beings.

Many teachers, underpaid and overwhelmed, turn to AI out of necessity.

But we have to ask: Why, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, are class sizes so large — and resources so scarce — that teachers are forced to rely on AI instead of instructional assistants? Why aren't we hiring more librarians to curate leveled texts or reducing class sizes so teachers can tailor learning themselves?

AI doesn't just flatten learning — it now can monitor students' digital behavior in deeply invasive ways. Marketed as safety tools, these systems track what students write, search, or post, even on school-issued devices taken home — extending surveillance into students' personal lives. Instead of funding counselors, schools spend thousands (like a New Jersey district's $58,000) on surveillance software. In Vancouver, Washington, a data breach exposed how much personal information, including mental health and LGBTQ+ identities, was quietly harvested. One study found almost 60 percent of U.S. students censor themselves when monitored. As Encode Justice leaders Shreya Sampath and Marisa Syed put it, students care that their “data is collected and commodified,” and that their peers “censor themselves in learning environments meant to encourage exploration.”

Ursula Wolfe-Rocca, a teacher at a low-income school in Portland, Oregon, described the current use of AI as “ad hoc,” with some teachers at her school experimenting with it and others not using it at all. While her school is still developing an official policy, she voiced concern about the AI enthusiasm among some staff and administrators, driven by “unsubstantiated hype about how AI can help close the equity gap.”

Wolfe-Rocca's description reflects a national pattern: AI use in schools is uneven and largely unregulated, yet districts are increasingly promoting its adoption. Even without a clear policy framework, the message many educators receive is that AI is coming, and they are expected to embrace it. Yet this push often comes without serious discussion of pedagogy, ethics, or the structural inequities AI may actually deepen — especially in underresourced schools like hers.

In today's AI gold rush, education entrepreneurs are trading in old scripts of standardization for sleek promises of personalization — touting artificial intelligence as the cure for everything from unequal tutoring access to teacher burnout. Take Salman Khan, founder of Khan Academy, who speaks in lofty terms about AI's potential. Khan recently created the Khanmigo chatbot tutor and described it as a way to “democratize student access to individualized tutoring,” claiming it could eventually give “every student in the United States, and eventually on the planet, a world-class personal tutor.” Khan's new book, Brave New Words, reads like a swooning love letter to AI — an emotionless machine that, fittingly, will never love him back. It's hard to ignore the irony of Khan titling his book Brave New Words — an echo of Huxley's dystopian novel Brave New World where individuality is erased, education is mechanized, and conformity is maintained through technological ease. But rather than treat Huxley's vision as a warning, Khan seems to take it as a blueprint, and his book reads like a case study in missing the point.

In one example, Khan praises Khanmigo's ability to generate a full World War II unit plan — complete with objectives and a multiple-choice classroom poll.

Students are asked to select the “most significant cause” of the war:

But the hard truths are nowhere to be found. Khanmigo, for example, doesn't prompt students to wrestle with the fact that Hitler openly praised the United States for its Jim Crow segregation laws, eugenics programs, and its genocide against Native Americans.

Like so many snake oil education “cures” before it, Khan has pulled up to the schoolhouse door with a wagon full of digital elixirs. It's classic EdTech hucksterism: a flashy pitch, sweeping claims about revolutionizing education, and recycled behaviorist ideas dressed up as innovation. Behaviorism — a theory that reduces learning to observable changes in behavior in response to external stimuli — treats students less as thinkers and more as programmable responders. Khan's vision of AI chatbots replacing human tutors isn't democratizing; it's dehumanizing.

“What we need isn't more AI — it's more teachers, support staff, and real training, especially after COVID left so many educators underprepared.”

Far from exciting or new, these automated “solutions” follow a long tradition of behaviorist teaching technologies. As historian Audrey Watters documents in Teaching Machines, efforts to personalize learning through automation began in the 1920s and gained traction with B.F. Skinner's teaching machines in the 1950s. But these tools often failed, built on the flawed assumption that learning is just programmed response rather than human connection.

Despite these failures, today's tech elites are doubling down. But let's be clear: this isn't the kind of education they want for their own children. The wealthy get small classes, music teachers, rich libraries, arts and debate programs, and human mentors. Our kids are offered AI bots in overcrowded classrooms. It's a familiar pattern — standardized, scripted learning for the many; creativity and care for the few. Elites claim AI will “level the playing field,” but they offload its environmental costs onto the public. Training large AI models consumes enormous amounts energy and water and fuels the climate crisis. The same billionaires pushing AI build private compounds to shield their children from the damage their industries cause — instead of regulating tech or cutting emissions, they protect their own from both the pedagogy and the fallout of their greed.

Em Winokur is an Oregon school librarian who joined the Multnomah Education Service District's “AI Innovators” cohort to offer a critical voice in a conversation dominated by hype and industry influence. She has seen the contradictions firsthand. “EdTech companies aren't invested in our students' growth or in building a more caring world,” Winokur told Truthout. “What we need isn't more AI — it's more teachers, support staff, and real training, especially after COVID left so many educators underprepared.”

Of course, hedge fund managers, CEOs, and the politicians they bankroll will scoff at this vision. They'll call it impractical, unaffordable, unrealistic. They'll argue that the economy can't support more educators, or school psychologists, smaller classes, or fully staffed school libraries. And then, without missing a beat, they'll offer AI as the solution: cheaper, faster, easier. Theirs is a vision for hollowed-out, mechanized imitation of education.

Many educators and students aren't passively accepting this AI-driven future. Youth-led groups like Encode Justice are at the forefront of the struggle to regulate AI. The Algorithmic Justice League is challenging the spread of biometric surveillance in schools, warning that facial recognition systems threaten student safety and school climate. Organizing efforts like Black Lives Matter at School and the Teach Truth movement are part of a growing refusal to let billionaires dictate the terms of learning.

AI in schools isn't progress — it's a sign of much deeper underlying problems with U.S. schooling that reveal how far we've strayed from the purpose of education. For decades, policy makers and profiteers have swapped human care for high-stakes testing, scripted curriculum, and surveillance. AI isn't the disease — it's a symptom of a colonizer's model of schooling that is extractive and dehumanizing, rather than liberating. That means regulating AI isn't enough — we must dismantle the logic that brought it in.

I once had a student — I'll call him Marcus — who was a high school senior already accepted into a good college. But late in the year, his grades dropped sharply, and he was suddenly at risk of not graduating. Over time, Marcus and I built trust — especially through lessons on Black history and resistance to racism. As a Black student who had long been denied this history, he came to see that I wasn't there to grade him, rank him, or punish him, but to fight injustice. That connection helped him open up and share with me that he was unhoused. Once I understood what he was facing, I connected him with support services and worked with his other teachers to be flexible and compassionate. He ended up passing his classes, graduating, and going on to college.

That kind of care doesn't come from code. It comes from a human relationship — one rooted in trust, justice, and love.

Four Alliance 90/Greens party members have sent an open letter to German Chancellor Friedrich Merz calling for a significant increase in military aid to Ukraine, Bild reported on July 5, citing a copy of the document.

The news comes as Russia's expanded drone production has enabled Moscow to launch as many as 500 drones in a single night against Ukraine on multiple occasions each week.

The letter's authors — Robin Wagener, Sara Nanni, Sebastian Schafer, and Anton Hofreiter — demanded that certain budget items be adjusted, particularly regarding support for Ukraine. They believe that the planned increase in Germany's defense funding for Kyiv from $8.4 billion in 2024 to $9.8 billion in 2025 is insufficient, according to Bild.

The signatories emphasized the need to strengthen Ukraine's air defense systems urgently.

"Without further air defense and assured supplies, Russian dictatorship over Ukraine becomes more likely," the letter read.

The lawmakers also noted that the situation has deteriorated as Russia continues to carry out large-scale attacks on Ukraine, and the United States, for its part, has partially suspended its military aid. 

The signatories reminded Merz that, thanks to the Greens party's support in the previous Bundestag, assistance to Ukraine had significantly increased. 

Before becoming chancellor, Merz, elected for the CDU/CSU conservative alliance, signaled he could overturn the ban of his predecessor, Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, on delivering Taurus to Ukraine.

The Taurus is a powerful cruise missile capable of striking targets at a distance of 500 kilometers (300 miles), more than the long-range capabilities Ukraine received from other partners.

However, the German government has not approved sending Taurus missiles to Ukraine so far. 

Ukraine has been using U.S.-made ATACMS for over a year, and U.K.-French Storm Shadow/SCALP for more than two, initially being allowed to deploy them only against Russian targets on Ukrainian territory.

Only in late 2024, the Biden administration and other allies eased the restrictions, allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian military targets on Russian territory.

An explosion "of an unknown nature" aboard the Eco Wizard tanker in Russia's Ust-Luga port near St. Petersburg caused an ammonia leak on July 6. 

Restrictions were imposed on 60 legal entities and 73 Russian citizens.



Russia attacked the front-line towns of Kostiantynivka and Druzhkivka on July 6, killing civilians and damaging homes and infrastructure. Governor Vadim Filashkin urged remaining residents to evacuate.

The attack, which occurred at around 9 a.m., injured 59 people, sparked fires, and damaged civilian infrastructure.

Four victims are reported to be in serious condition, including two teenagers (ages 14 and 18) and two seniors (ages 67 and 71). The bus was carrying a children's ensemble from Lviv to a dance festival in Ohrid. 

The media outlet also published footage purportedly showing a burning maritime drone that was allegedly shot down during the attack.

The signatories emphasized the need to strengthen Ukraine's air defense systems urgently.

Fears of escalating Chinese military intervention in Taiwan have risen sharply since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 

Russian forces launched four S-300 anti-aircraft missiles and 157 Shahed drones against Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine's Air Force.

The news comes amid a major deterioration in Russian-Azerbaijani relations after a deadly June 27 operation in Russia's Yekaterinburg, where Russian security forces killed two Azerbaijani nationals. 

Russian air defenses on July 5 shot down four drones advancing on Moscow, prompting a temporary halt to outgoing flights at Sheremetyevo, one of the capital's main airports.

The number includes 1,180 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Explosions near Russia's Vladivostok damaged a gas pipeline and destroyed a water pipeline that supplied military facilities in the area, an unnamed intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on July 5.

The announcement came a day after Trump signed his sweeping tax cut and spending bill into law, a legislative act that Musk has fiercely opposed.

Benedict Kuria was ambushed by suspected gang members in March while serving in security mission

The relatives of a Kenyan police officer who went missing while working in Haiti have spoken of their anguish and anger at Kenyan authorities over a lack of definitive information about what has happened to him.

Benedict Kuria and some colleagues were ambushed in March by suspected gang members. Haitian media reported that he had died, but Kenya's police service says a search is continuing.

“We've tried many times to get information from the government, but they've refused,” said Kuria's wife, Miriam Watima. “We don't know what to do any more.”

Hundreds of Kenyan officers have been posted to Haiti as part of a US and UN-backed mission to help police in the Caribbean country get to grips with rampant gang violence. More than a million people have been forced from their homes in a relentless cycle of indiscriminate killings, kidnappings, gang rapes and arson.

Kuria's case has reignited public concern over Kenya's involvement in the multinational security support mission (MSS), which started last year and was the subject of intense domestic public and legal scrutiny from the outset.

In a search for answers, Kuria's family filed a court petition in June that listed the attorney-general, the inspector general of police and various ministers as respondents. A Nairobi court has scheduled a preliminary court appearance for September but the family, who want the matter treated with urgency, have called for the session to be brought forward.

“We entrusted our son with the government,” said Kuria's mother, Jacinta Kabiru. “They should give us the information.”

Kuria, a 33-year-old administration police officer, joined the MSS last July. On 26 March the MSS said he was “unaccounted for” after an ambush the day before on a team who had gone to assist the recovery of a Haitian police vehicle stuck in a ditch that it suspected had been dug by gangs.

Later on 26 March, Kenyan police said a search and rescue mission was continuing, while local leaders and police chiefs went to Watima's house in the town of Kikuyu, north-west of Nairobi in Kiambu county, to tell her that her husband was missing.

But the following day, Haitian media outlets reported that Kuria had been killed, quoting Haiti's presidential transitional council as saying that he “fell … while carrying out his mission” and “gave his life for a better future for our country”.

In the months since, his family's desperate scramble for clarity has included visits to police – who have told them a search and rescue mission is continuing – and politicians' offices. Through their lawyer, Mbuthi Gathenji, they have petitioned parliament and written letters to Kenya's attorney-general and María Isabel Salvador, the special representative of the UN secretary-general in Haiti.

Their court petition accuses government officials of “refusing and/or neglecting” to provide the family with information on Kuria's whereabouts “to ease their agony”, and asks judges to assist in “compelling the respondents to disclose information”.

“You can imagine the pain that the parents and relatives are going through,” said Gathenji. “We are asking the government to come out with finality.”

The Guardian has approached Kenya's interior cabinet secretary as well as the MSS and the Kenyan police for comment.

Kenya's leading role in the mission stemmed from a desire by the US and the UN to restructure international intervention in Haiti with a multinational mission headed by an African country, after a series of floundering UN missions during which UN troops caused a cholera outbreak and peacekeepers were accused of sexual assault.

Kenya, which has participated in many peacekeeping missions internationally, volunteered to lead the Haiti intervention. For its president, William Ruto, the deployment was a chance to position his country as a reliable international partner and burnish the reputation of its police force, which regularly uses violence against civilians.

The arrival of the Kenyan officers in June 2024 brought some hope to Haiti, but the mission, beset by funding, equipment and personnel issues, has failed to repel the criminal advance.

In April, Salvador said Haiti was approaching a “point of no return”. And on Wednesday, Ghada Waly, the executive director of the UN office on drugs and crime, told the UN security council that gangs now controlled an estimated 90% of the capital, Port-au-Prince.

Kuria's mother had tried to dissuade him from joining the mission after learning about Haiti's violent reputation, but he was determined to go, motivated in part by the extra pay the job came with, which he planned to use to improve his relatives' lives. “This is an opportunity we have got as a family,” his brother, Philip Kuria, recalled him saying.

Kuria was due to return this year at the end of his one-year contract. “It's a struggle,” said Philip. “What we want is closure.”

Kuria's uncle, Daniel Ndung'u, said the family was open to any news. “My prayer is that he's going to come back to join us,” he said. “This suspense is actually torturing us.”

Watima recalled her last call with Kuria as they discussed academic plans for their 17-year-old daughter. She tops up credit for her husband's phone so it doesn't get deactivated, hoping that one day he'll call again. In the meantime, she waits for the government. “They should tell us whether he's alive or not,” she said. “That's all we want to know.”

There are just two days of talks left before the US president's potentially swingeing tariffs are restored

The EU is entering a crunch week with only two days of talks left to secure a trade deal with Washinton to avert Donald Trump's threatened 50% tariff on its imports into the US.

According to the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, on Friday, the negotiations – which continued over the weekend – are focussed on 15 to 18 agreements with important partners, while Trump warned of import tax rates of up to 70% on others.

The uncertainty created by Washington has sent shock waves through the global economy. Businesses have paused investment and the dollar posted its worst performance in 50 years in the first half of the year.

With the clock ticking down to Trump's 9 July deadline, the European Commission remains uncertain how he will treat the bloc, threatening €1.6tn of transatlantic trade.

“Among member states, the big question will be whether we should reach a deal at all costs to avoid a trade war, or show muscle if the deal is not good enough,” one EU diplomat said.

The German chancellor, , has said he wants a quick UK-style deal to avert a full-scale trade war, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, favours holding out for a better deal if a rushed deal is “imbalanced”.

Giving a flavour of the aggression shown towards the EU, which Trump once called “nastier than China”, Brussels' trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, was threatened last week with 17% tariffs on food imports during talks with senior members of the Trump administration including Bessent.

After announcing punitive “liberation day” tariffs on nearly all countries on 2 April, Trump paused them for 90 days a week later.

The US is now on the brink of launching a trade assault on dozens of countries as the 90-day period expires on Wednesday with only two deals in the bag – the UK and Vietnam.

This has raised questions about the EU's ability to strike anything other than a political framework agreement to extend talks while a baseline 10% tariff and other levies on cars, steel and aluminium remain in place.

As talks move into the final and most sensitive stage, industries across Europe are bracing themselves for fresh challenges, deal or no deal. They expect the cost of Trump's presidency will be the minimum 10% on exports to the US, five times higher than the 2% average before he was elected last year.

That is because after months of threats of retaliatory tariffs on everything from Bourbon to Boeing aircraft, the EU conceded last week that a comprehensive trade deal was unattainable.

Instead they are aiming for an agreement in principle, or “framework deal” which will look more like the UK deal struck in May, which came into force at the end of last month.

Many EU diplomats initially dismissed the UK deal as thin and legally dubious under World Trade Organization rules, and held out hope that the bloc's greater economic clout with €1.6tn of transatlantic trade compared with the UK's £314bn (€363bn) would help it secure a better deal. But now they realise a bare-bones deal may be the best they can get.

TEL AVIV, July 6. /TASS/. The Israel Defense Forces said it continues to consistently carry out strikes across entire Gaza.

The Israeli Air Force, acting in coordination with ground forces, attacked about 130 targets there over the past 24 hours, the army press service reported.

Among the targets were various Hamas sites, including command posts, weapons depots and rocket launchers. Strikes also targeted individual armed militants.

Ground units are conducting raids throughout all of the Strip.

"The Israel Defense Forces are acting to eliminate any threat to the peaceful citizens of the State of Israel," the IDF said.

Armenia's Foreign Ministry on July 5 denied claims by Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) that Russia was intensifying its military presence at the country's Gyumri base to exert greater influence in the South Caucasus, the media outlet News Armenia reported. 

The news comes amid a major deterioration in Russian-Azerbaijani relations after a deadly June 27 operation in Russia's Yekaterinburg, where Russian security forces killed two Azerbaijani nationals and injured several others in a raid linked to a 2001 murder case.

HUR claimed on July 5 that Russia was increasing its military presence in Gyumri and recruiting new troops for the base. Ukraine's military intelligence argued that the alleged move was aimed at "destabilizing the global security situation." 

Ani Badalyan, the Armenian Foreign Ministry's spokesperson, rejected the report. 

"In response to the fictitious information that appeared in the press, the Republic of Armenia reaffirms its principled position that the territory of the Republic of Armenia cannot be used by third states to carry out military actions against any of its neighboring states," she said, as cited by News Armenia. 

Armenia has had a historically close relationship with Russia but the relations between Yerevan and Moscow have recently deteriorated. 

Russia's leverage over both Baku and Yerevan has diminished dramatically since Azerbaijani troops captured Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-controlled region in Azerbaijan, in 2023.

Russian peacekeepers later withdraw from the region, and now Baku and Yerevan are negotiating a permanent peace deal.

Armenia, which has lambasted Moscow for failing to help it during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, is drifting closer to the West.

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has suspended the country's membership in a Russian-led military alliance and announced plans to join the European Union. Recently there has also been a crackdown on the pro-Russian opposition in Armenia.

An explosion "of an unknown nature" aboard the Eco Wizard tanker in Russia's Ust-Luga port near St. Petersburg caused an ammonia leak on July 6. 

Restrictions were imposed on 60 legal entities and 73 Russian citizens.



Russia attacked the front-line towns of Kostiantynivka and Druzhkivka on July 6, killing civilians and damaging homes and infrastructure. Governor Vadim Filashkin urged remaining residents to evacuate.

The attack, which occurred at around 9 a.m., injured 59 people, sparked fires, and damaged civilian infrastructure.

Four victims are reported to be in serious condition, including two teenagers (ages 14 and 18) and two seniors (ages 67 and 71). The bus was carrying a children's ensemble from Lviv to a dance festival in Ohrid.

            There is a Diogo Jota performance that many Liverpool supporters will remember above all others.
    


            In October 2022, with the Reds struggling badly for form, Jota and Co. came up against a Manchester City team that would go on to win a historic treble that season.
    


            A month before the 2022 men's World Cup – the tournament Jota later said was “one of his dreams” to play in – many players might have taken it easy for fear of injuring themselves.
    


            Not Jota.
    


            The Portuguese forward did not contribute a goal or an assist, but he played 100 minutes and battled to win the ball back on countless occasions. Liverpool won 1-0, but Jota's tireless performance saw him go down with an injury in the final minute. He would go on to miss the World Cup.
    


            With the tournament set to come around again next year, Jota would very likely have finally fulfilled that dream in 2026.
    


            That opportunity, along with the far more important chance to experience life as a young father and newlywed, was cruelly snatched from the 28-year-old on Thursday morning when he and his brother, André Silva, died in a car crash in northwestern Spain.
    


            Maybe Jota would have avoided the injury against Manchester City if he had stayed out of the difficult tackles. But that is not the kind of player he was.
    


            “The way he played the game was full of this sort of scampering energy. … He would hunt the ball down aggressively, and he'd hunt space down aggressively.” Neil Atkinson, CEO and host of The Anfield Wrap, told CNN Sports' Amanda Davies.
    


            Jota's technical gifts – while remarkably apparent at times – were not on the level of those of some of his teammates. But it was that willingness to fight that made him such a popular figure on Merseyside, and the reason why it has been difficult to go to a Liverpool game in the last few years and not hear the crowd's famous song for him.
    


            “They loved that work ethic, that sheer desire, and the fact that he had almost a sense of mischief about him in the manner of his goals as well,” Atkinson said. “And I think that very much endeared him to the supporters.”
    


            The Portuguese international was vocal about his philosophy of hard work on the pitch.
    


            “As a fan – I was a fan myself – you want to see a player fighting for the club, for the badge that they both love,” he said in a video which was released by Liverpool on Thursday following the news of his death.
    


            But that tenacity was not just limited to his attitude on the field. As a young player struggling for games at one of the biggest clubs in the world – Atlético Madrid – the forward opted to join Wolverhampton Wanderers, a team which, at that time, was in the Championship, the second tier of English soccer.
    


            His bravery was rewarded as he became one of the best players in the team, eventually signing for Liverpool in 2020.
    


            It was at Liverpool where Jota appeared to find particular kinship with a city that, like him, has often had to fight.
    


            In 1981, after riots began in Liverpool as a result of tensions between police and the Black community, then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was secretly urged by her finance minister, Geoffrey Howe, to pursue a policy of “managed decline” with reference to the city.
    


            According to Howe, spending public money on the city would be like “trying to make water flow uphill.”
    


            Eight years later, when the Hillsborough disaster claimed the lives of 97 Liverpool supporters at an FA Cup semifinal, the city once again felt the brunt of the establishment.
    


            Both the local police and some sections of the British media blamed Liverpool fans. Despite tireless campaigning by the victims' families, it would take until 2016 for an inquest to rule that those who died were unlawfully killed and that fan behavior did not cause or contribute to the disaster.

With another glorious moment marred by tragedy, Liverpool and its supporters find strength in a familiar place – each other



            Liverpool is a club that has had more than its fair share of tragedy. Less than six weeks ago, a car rammed into a crowd of people at a parade to celebrate the club's Premier League title win, injuring dozens of people, including children.
    


            In the face of this latest tragedy Thursday morning, the city will once again come together to grieve.
    


            “The only way to get through this is to get through it together,” Atkinson said.
    


            The importance of that collectiveness was echoed by another Liverpool fan, Sally – who did not give her surname when she spoke to CNN Sports' Matias Grez outside Anfield on Thursday.
    


            “You stick together because that's the only way it's going to work,” she said. “That's the community spirit. It's not just Liverpool, it's Everton as well. Rivalries aside, times like this everyone comes together. It doesn't matter who you support.”
    


            Indeed, among the hundreds of scarves, flowers and messages that were left for Jota and his brother outside Anfield, items laid by fans of Everton, Liverpool's local rival, were visible.
    


            “I'm not really a massive one for social media, so I hadn't seen any of what I'm now seeing in front of me,” another supporter, Simon Walker, told CNN in reference to the tributes left at the stadium. “But I'm not surprised in the slightest because this is how this club and this city operates.”
    


            To say that Jota – a man who grew up in a small town outside Porto, 886 miles (1426 kilometers) away – fit well in Liverpool would be an understatement.
    


            That affinity extended to some of the less-Portuguese pastimes. In tribute posts on social media, former teammates Andy Robertson and Caoimhín Kelleher both referenced their surprise at Jota's enjoyment of darts and horse racing, with Robertson even jokingly referring to him as “Diogo MacJota.”
    


            “You could relate to him,” Sally, the Liverpool supporter who spoke to CNN, said Thursday. “You could tell he was a down-to-earth fella. He was very humble. He wasn't showy-offy. He was just very much a family man.
    


            “I think that's what relates everyone in the city to him, because we're all like a family.”
    


            The funeral for the 28-year-old and his brother took place in their hometown of Gondomar on Saturday morning. The pain that their family, Jota's wife and their three children are experiencing far exceeds that of those who marveled from afar at his performances on a soccer pitch.
    


            But it is a testament to Jota's spirit and tenacity that Liverpool too is grieving the loss of one of its most beloved sons.

By Kodai Fujimoto / Yomiuri Shimbun Staff Writer

14:46 JST, July 6, 2025

Japanese literature specialist Susumu Nakanishi has published a book introducing the appeal of manyo nihonga, paintings inspired by works in Manyoshu, a compilation of classic waka poems of the eighth century.

The 95-year-old author of “Nakanishi Susumu to Manyoga o Tanoshimu” (Find enjoyment in manyo nihonga with Susumu Nakanishi), published by Tankosha Publishing, believes that poetry and painting are closely related. He talked about the pleasure of enjoying waka poetry together with paintings in an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun.

Manyo nihonga was created for the opening of the Nara Prefecture Complex of Man'yo Culture in Asuka, Nara Prefecture, in 2001. Nakanishi served as the complex's first director. The collection features work by 154 artists, including Matazo Kayama and Shoko Uemura. They depict landscapes and figures described in Japan's oldest anthology of poems. The ancient waka poetry and modern paintings meet and resonate with each other, creating vivid imagery.

Nakanishi said that adding pictures to poetry is something “essential” for human beings. The leading scholar of Manyoshu was a member of a university art club when he was a student.

“What you hear becomes literature, and what you see becomes pictures. Poetry and pictures are two sides of the same coin in terms of sensitivity, and, depending on the way we perceive nature, it becomes a picture or a poem,” he said.

Manyoshu is a collection of poems by a wide range of people, from emperors to commoners. Various areas in Japan serve as settings, with many being composed by people while traveling for leisure or for work.

For example, a poem by Yamabe no Akahito about snow-capped Mt. Fuji reads:

“Tagonoura yu / uchiidete mireba / mashiro niso / fuji no takane ni / yuki wa furikeru” (When going out along the shore of Tago and looking at the lofty peak of Mt. Fuji, I see white, glittering snow on top)

Inspired by this poem, Tamako Kataoka, in “Mt. Fuji Seen from Tagonoura,” boldly depicted the mountain with a halo of light.

“The painting depicts well the deep shock the people of that period, who were accustomed to rounded mountains, must have had when they saw the sharp figure of Mt Fuji. It depicts the sacredness of the mountain, too,” Nakanishi said. He said Kataoka did not paint the mountain as it was, but instead “broke down the concrete image of the mountain and reconstructed people's surprise.”

Nakanishi also talked about colors. Shunei Nishida painted “Losing My Way among Autumn Leaves,” inspired by a poem by Kakinomoto no Hitomaro, which reads:

“Akiyama no / momichi o shigemi / matoinuru / imo o motomen / yamaji shirazumo” (With the lush yellow leaves of autumn mountain, I wander the mountain path seeking my lost wife)

Nishida painted most of the canvas in red, depicting a landscape of autumn leaves.

“I was stunned by the bold blood-red color,” said Nakanishi. He also pointed to a small white waterfall painted in the background. Since ancient times, white has been considered a sacred color, and that is why he sees the waterfall as a symbol of an “unobtainable, pure white soul” that Hitomaro was seeking.

“While you stare at paintings, you begin to feel as if they grow eyes and stare back at you,” Nakanishi said.

The new book carries about 30 paintings and text by Nakanishi containing knowledge and thoughts about Manyoshu and columns by Sayaka Inoue, the planning and research section chief at the cultural facility. Written in simple yet profound language, the book serves as an introduction to the world of Manyoshu.

Nakanishi believes that the world of poetry, which conveys something more than facts, is indispensable for modern people. He compared it to “frills” on clothing. “They may not serve any practical purpose but can comfort people and soothe their hearts. The role of poetry is essential to human beings,” he said.

Poems in Manyoshu still stir the imaginations of people and touch their hearts. Manyo nihonga, which bring together the sensibilities of ancient and modern times, remind us of poetry's universal power.

MIAMI (AP) — Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a depression Sunday but raised concerns of possible flash flooding as it makes its way into central and eastern North Carolina. 

Chantal made landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, at about 4 a.m. EDT Sunday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. At 11 a.m., it was located about 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of Wilmington, North Carolina, and was moving north at 9 mph (14 kph) with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (56 kph). 

The system was expected to turn to the northeast late Sunday as it weakens further. 

The hurricane center canceled tropical storm warnings for portions of the two Carolinas. But heavy rain was forecast for parts of North Carolina through Monday, with total rainfall of 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) and local amounts up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) that could lead to flash flooding.

Forecasters said dangerous surf and rip currents at beaches from northeastern Florida to the mid-Atlantic states are expected to last for the next couple of days.

South Carolina's Emergency Management division had warned residents earlier of the possibility of isolated tornadoes along the coast and of minor coastal flooding. It also warned drivers not to venture on water-covered roads or around road-closure signs where flooding occurred.

The monstrous, swift-moving flood that swept through the Hill Country of Texas on Friday, killing at least 67 people and leaving many more missing, was a flash flood, the nation's top storm-related killer. Among those missing are girls attending a summer camp.

Authorities said about 850 people had been rescued, including some by helicopter.

Here are some facts about flash floods.

According to the National Weather Service, a flash flood is flooding that begins within six hours, and often in as little as three hours, of heavy rainfall.

Waters rise so quickly that people are caught off guard, according to the weather service. Many people run into trouble while traveling. If at home or work, the water can rise so quickly that people are trapped before they have time to think about escape.

That is just what happened to residents along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County and the surrounding area after at least 10 inches (25 centimeters) poured from the sky early Friday morning.

Fast-moving waters along the river rose 26 feet (8 meters) in just 45 minutes before dawn Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as more heavy rains were expected Saturday, and flash flood warnings and flood watches remained in effect for parts of central Texas.




On Thursday afternoon, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch, estimating rising water of up to 7 inches (17 centimeters) in spots. A “watch” means conditions are favorable for a flood and people should be prepared, but hazardous conditions might not develop. 

But the watch was upgraded to a flood warning overnight, a notice that impacted 30,000 people. A warning is issued when flooding is imminent or occurring, the weather service says.

Lt,. Gov. Dan Patrick said the potential for heavy rain and flooding covered a large area, and “everything was done to give them a heads-up that you could have heavy rain.” 

However, when asked about how people were notified in Kerr County so that they could get to safety, Judge Rob Kelly, the county's chief elected official, said: “We do not have a warning system.”

When reporters pushed on why more precautions weren't taken, Kelly responded: “Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming.”

Last year, 145 people died in flash floods, according to the weather service. On average over the past 30 years, floods have claimed 127 lives annually.

Nearly half of all flood-related fatalities involve vehicles. Flood deaths affect all age groups. 

Many people don't realize that a car becomes difficult to control in just 6 inches (15 centimeters) of water and can be swept away in as little as 18 inches (46 centimeters). So instead of finding a detour, too often people try to drive through water at underpasses or other low-lying areas.

It can happen anywhere, according to the weather service, which says that “the normally tranquil streams and creeks in your neighborhood can become raging torrents if heavy rain falls overhead.”

An area can be flooded even without rain — if it's downstream of a torrential rainstorm and a swollen stream heads its way. 

Hurricanes, tropical storms, non-cyclonic weather systems carrying heavy rain and dam failures are some weather events that can cause flash flooding. They can happen in rural areas or in large cities.

U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matt Whitaker joins 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss the concern with Iranian sleeper cells and the latest on the war in Ukraine as President Donald Trump continues to advocate for peace. 

U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matt Whitaker argued Iran is at a "decision point" following its war with Israel and U.S. airstrikes on its nuclear program — all while U.S. officials remain on high alert for sleeper cell concerns. 

Whitaker urged Iran to seek peace during "Sunday Morning Futures," while noting that the U.S. is still dealing with the implications of an open border – and the national security implications of it – from the Biden administration. 

"It's obviously a very dangerous world, Jason," Whitaker told Fox News' Jason Chaffetz on Sunday. "I think… President Trump, as a peacemaker, has made it safer, but at the same time, we're still dealing with a lot of the consequences of four years of Joe Biden, including a porous border, where not only did we have, as Tom Homan points out, over 1,200 Iranian nationals that came into our country that we know of, but you had over a million known gotaways that we have no idea who they are, where they went, and that's a real challenge."

BORDER PATROL ANNOUNCES 'PHENOMENAL' TURNAROUND AS NUMBER OF MONTHLY MIGRANT RELEASES DROPS TO ZERO

"But, at the same time, you know, President Trump has been very clear about his policy towards Iran, that they cannot have a nuclear weapon," he added. "And they're at a decision point. They should move forward and seek peace."

Over 1,500 Iranian nationals who illegally entered the U.S. at the southern border were arrested during the Biden administration, and nearly 50% of them were released back into the country, according to a senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) source last month. 

More specifically, Border Patrol agents arrested 1,504 Iranian nationals from fiscal year 2021 through fiscal year 2024. Of the 1,504 individuals who were arrested, 729 were released into the United States. 

Meanwhile, just hours after Trump addressed the nation about U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, DHS released a new memo sounding the alarm on a "heightened threat environment in the United States." 

The bulletin from the National Terrorism Advisory System did not cite any specific threats but comes as Iranian officials have threatened retaliation. 

BORDER CZAR TOM HOMAN REVEALS UNPRECEDENTED SUCCESS IN TRUMP'S BORDER STRATEGY

"It is our duty to keep the nation safe and informed, especially during times of conflict," the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "The ongoing Israel-Iran conflict brings the possibility of increased threat to the homeland in the form of possible cyberattacks, acts of violence, and antisemitic hate crimes."

Whitaker argued the growing threat of possible Iranian sleeper cell activity in the United States puts tremendous pressure on law enforcement to be right "100 percent of the time."

"Iran should come to the table and should sue for peace, and should make a peace deal with the United States, with Israel, and just say, ‘No more. We want to be in the world where people seek prosperity and a bright future for their citizens,'" he said. 

"So, Jason… right now, this puts a lot of pressure on our law enforcement, puts a lot of pressure on… DOJ and the FBI to be right 100 percent of the time and seek out these sleeper cells and to make sure that they can't activate," he added.

TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — The voices of tens of thousands of choir singers rang out in the rain in Estonia on Sunday, and a huge crowd of spectators erupted in applause, unfazed by the gloomy weather.

The Song Festival Grounds, a massive outdoor venue in the Estonian capital Tallinn, was filled with spectators Saturday evening despite the downpour, and absolutely packed on Sunday, with even more people attending. The traditional Song and Dance Celebration, which decades ago inspired resistance to Soviet control and was later recognized by the U.N.'s cultural agency, attracted tens of thousands of performers and spectators alike, many in national costume. 

The four-day choir-singing and dancing event centers around Estonian folk songs and patriotic anthems and is held roughly every five years. The tradition dates back to the 19th century. In the late 1980s, it inspired the defiant Singing Revolution, helping Estonia and other Baltic nations break free from the Soviet occupation. 

To this day, it remains a major point of national pride for a country of about 1.3 million.

This year, tickets to the main event -– a seven-hour concert on Sunday featuring choirs of all ages -– sold out weeks in advance.

Rasmus Puur, a conductor at the song festival and assistant to the artistic director, ascribes the spike in popularity to Estonians longing for a sense of unity in the wake of the global turmoil, especially Russia's war in Ukraine.

“We want to feel as one today more than six years ago (when the celebration was last held), and we want to feel that we are part of Estonia,” Puur told The Associated Press on Friday. 





The theme of the song festival this year is dialects and regional languages, and the repertoire is a mix of folk songs, well-known patriotic anthems that are traditionally sung at these celebrations and new pieces written specifically for the occasion.

The festival's artistic director, Heli Jürgenson, says that although the audience won't know all the songs -– especially those sung in dialects -– there will be many opportunities to sing along.

The main concert on Sunday night will end with a song called “My Fatherland is My Love” –- a patriotic song Estonians spontaneously sang at the 1960 festival in protest against the Soviet regime. Every song celebration since 1965 has concluded with this anthem in what both performers and spectators describe as the highest emotional point of the whole event.

An emotional Jürgenson, who this year will conduct a combined choir of about 19,000 people singing it, said: “This is a very special moment.”

She believes that what drove the tradition more than 150 years ago still drives it today.

“There have been different turning points, there have been a lot of historical twists, but the need for singing, songs and people have remained the same,” she said. “There are certain songs that we always sing, that we want to sing. This is what keeps this tradition going for over 150 years.” 



The tradition to hold massive first song-only, then song and dance festivals dates back to the time when Estonia was part of the Russian Empire. 

The first song celebration was held in 1869 in the southern city of Tartu. It heralded a period of national awakening for Estonians, when Estonian-language press, theater and other things emerged, says Elo-Hanna Seljamaa, associate professor at the University of Tartu.

The festivals continued throughout a period of Estonia's independence between the two world wars and then during the nearly 50 years of Soviet occupation. 

The Soviet rulers were into “mass spectacles of all kinds, so in a way it was very logical for the Soviet regime to tap into this tradition and to try to co-opt it,” Seljamaa said in an interview.

Estonians had to sing Soviet propaganda songs in Russian during that time, but they were also able to sing their own songs in their own language, which was both an act of defiance and an act of therapy for them, she said.

At the same time, the complicated logistics of putting together a mass event like that taught Estonians to organize, Seljamaa said, so when the political climate changed in the 1980s, the protest against the Soviet rule naturally came in the form of coming together and singing.

The unity extended beyond Estonia's borders. During the Singing Revolution, 2 million people in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania joined hands to form a 600-kilometer (370-mile) human chain that protested Soviet occupation of the Baltics with a song.

In 2003, the United Nations' cultural body, UNESCO, recognized Estonia's folk song festival and similar events in Latvia and Lithuania for showcasing the “intangible cultural heritage of humanity.”



Marina Nurming recalls attending the Singing Revolution gatherings in the 1980s as a teenager. This year she traveled to Tallinn from Luxembourg, where she currently lives, to take part in the Song and Dance Celebration as a choir singer –- her longtime hobby.

The Singing Revolution is a time “when we sang ourselves free,” she told AP.

Seljamaa says the song and dance celebration may have suffered a drop in popularity in the 1990s, a somewhat difficult time for Estonia as it was emerging as an independent country after the Soviet Union collapsed, but has since bounced back.

There is a tremendous interest in it among young people, she says, and always more performers willing to take part than the venue can fit in, and there are people who had left Estonia to live abroad, but travel back to take part.

Nurming is one example. She is part of the European Choir of Estonians – a singing group that unites Estonians from more than a dozen countries.



This year's four-day celebration, which started on Thursday, included several stadium dancing performances by over 10,000 dancers from all around the country and a folk music instrument concert.

It culminated over the weekend with the song festival featuring some 32,000 choir singers. That was preceded by a large procession, in which all participants -– singers, dancers, musicians, clad in traditional costumes and waving Estonian flags –- marched from the city center to the Song Festival Grounds by the Baltic Sea.

Those taking part come from all corners of Estonia, and there are collectives from abroad, as well. It's a mix of men, women and children, with participants aged from six to 93.

For most, singing and dancing is a hobby on top of their day jobs or studies. But to take part in the celebration, collectives had to go through a rigorous selection process, and months worth of rehearsals.

For Karl Kesküla, an electrical engineer from Estonia's western island of Saaremaa, this is the first time taking part in the song celebration as a singer -– but he attended it before as a spectator.

“I got the feeling that what they did was really special and almost, like, every person you meet has gone to it or been a part of it at least once. So I just wanted that feeling too,” Kesküla, 30, told the AP at the procession on Saturday. 



Participants described the celebrations as being an important part of their national identity.

“Estonians are always getting through the hard times through songs, through songs and dances. If it's hard, we sing together and that brings everything back together and then we forget our troubles,” singer Piret Jakobson said.

“It's really good with all Estonian people to do the same thing,” said engineer Taavi Pentma, who took part in the dance performances. “So we are, like, breathing in one and the heart is beating (as one).”

Some 100 members of the European Choir of Estonians came to the Song Celebration this year from various corners of Europe. Among them is Kaja Kriis, who traveled from Germany, where she's been living for the last 25 years.

“Estonia is my home,” she said, adding that it's important for her “to be together with my friends, to keep my Estonian language, to maintain the Estonian language and Estonian culture.”

Gov. Greg Abbott, R-Texas, has declared a 'Day of Prayer' after flash floods devastate the state as the death toll and missing persons list rises.

Critics of President Donald Trump wasted no time blaming staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) for the widespread death and destruction caused by the floods in Texas, a reaction the White House called "shameful and disgusting."

At least 59 people, including 21 children, have been confirmed dead from the flash floods along the Guadalupe River that began Friday. Eleven children and one counselor remain missing from a girls' summer camp near the river, which flooded due to the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry. That storm made landfall over Mexico, but triggered massive unexpected thunderstorms over parts of Texas. 

"It only took 9 days for Trump's cuts to the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] to kill dozens of children in Texas when Tropical Storm Barry landed this week," Grant Stern, the executive editor of Occupy Democrats, wrote on X. 

TEXAS FLOOD SURVIVORS SHARE HARROWING STORIES, SEARCH CONTINUES FOR THOSE STILL MISSING

"The people in Texas voted for government services controlled by Donald Trump and Greg Abbott," added Ron Filipkowski, former federal prosecutor and the editor-in-chief of MediasTouchNews. "That is exactly what they (sic) getting."

"What has happened to the girls at Camp Mystic is EXACTLY what one of the country's best meteorologists, John Morales, warned would happen," added Rachel Bitecofer, assistant director at Christopher Newport University's Wason Center for Public Policy. "Trump's cuts to the NOAA & NWS have critically impacted storm prediction nationwide."

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem held a press conference Saturday, and acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding the nation's flood notification systems, which included concerns that weather forecasts underestimated the amount of rain that ultimately fell. 

Noem noted that the Trump administration is "currently upgrading" the nation's flood notification technology, which she described as "ancient." 

DEADLY TEXAS FLOOD EXPOSES ‘NEGLECTED' WEATHER ALERT SYSTEM TRUMP AIMS TO MODERNIZE

"When the [weather] system came over the area, it stalled," Noem said during the press conference. "It was much more water, much like [what] we experienced during [Hurricane] Harvey, with the same type of system that was unpredictable in the way that it reacted in the way that it stopped right here and dumped unprecedented amounts of rain that caused a flooding event like this."

Tom Fahy, legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, told NBC News that weather forecasting offices were adequately staffed, and "they issued timely forecasts and warnings leading up to the storm," but he added that unfilled leadership positions were "clearly a concern."

"All I'll say is this. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for Kerr County more than 12 hours ahead of the catastrophic flood. A flash flood warning was issued for Hunt & Ingram 3 HOURS before the Guadalupe started to climb," said Texas-based meteorologist Avery Tomasco. "They did their job and they did it well."

The same sentiment was echoed by other meteorological experts as well.

But, still, news of the advanced warnings has not stopped people from using the catastrophe to criticize the Trump administration.

"The reason Trump defunded the National Weather Service leading to the deaths of all those girls in the Texas flood is because PROJECT 2025 THOUGHT WEATHER PREDICTION SCIENCE WAS TIED TO EVIDENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE," musician Mikel Jollett wrote on X. 

WHITE HOUSE INSISTS FEMA IS TAKING HURRICANE SEASON 'SERIOUSLY,' BLASTS 'SLOPPY' REPORTING

Isaiah Martin, a Democratic candidate for Texas's 18th Congressional District, called for an immediate congressional investigation into "the Republican DOGE cuts to NOAA and the National Weather Service."

"We saw the affects (sic) this weekend," Martin wrote on X. "Trump defunded these agencies and we DEMAND answers. There MUST be *swift* accountability!" 

"Trump & Musk gutted the National Weather Service. The result was predictable: A bad forecast leading to the death of children in a horrific flood," added California state Senator Scott Wiener.

Meanwhile, Washington Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee did not directly blame Trump's approach to climate change for the deaths, but he suggested the president's efforts to peel back green energy funding are a contributing factor to increased catastrophic natural disasters, like this weekend's flood in Texas. 

"It is hard to make the Texas flood tragedy worse, except to know that on the same day Trump signed a bill cratering solar and wind energy that is vital in the battle against the climate change making these torrential rains more frequent," Inslee wrote on X this weekend. 

During an interview with CNN, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, added that he didn't think it was helpful to have open leadership positions that, if filled, could "help prevent these strategies."

"I don't think it's helpful to have missing key personnel from the National Weather Service not in place to help prevent these tragedies," Castro said, adding "we have to figure out in the future how we make sure that it doesn't happen again."

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson called it "shameful and disgusting" to see that in the wake of this tragedy people are politicizing what took place.

﻿"It's shameful and disgusting that in the wake of tragedy, the left's first instinct is to lie and politicize a disaster to target their political opponents. False claims about the NWS have been repeatedly debunked by meteorologists, experts, and other public reporting," Jackson said. "The NWS did their job, even issuing a flood watch more than 12 hours in advance. The Trump Administration is grateful to the first responders who sprung into action to save hundreds lives during this catastrophe, and will continue to help the great state of Texas in their recovery efforts."

Gov. Greg Abbott, R-Texas, has declared a 'Day of Prayer' after flash floods devastate the state as the death toll and missing persons list rises.

A Republican lawmaker said he was reunited with his two daughters who were attending a Christian summer camp that was destroyed when deadly flooding swept through Central Texas over the weekend.

Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, said his two daughters were evacuated from Camp Mystic, a camp along the banks of the Guadalupe River in Hunt, Texas.

"Camille, Vivian and I are now reunited with Caroline and Juliana who were evacuated from Camp Mystic," Pfluger said of his family. "The last day has brought unimaginable grief to many families and we mourn with them as well as holding out hope for survivors."

As of Sunday morning, five young girls who were staying at Camp Mystic have been confirmed dead. Kerr County officials confirmed 27 campers were still missing about 36 hours after the flood. There were 750 attendees when the wall of water slammed into the camp.

"The camp was completely destroyed," 13-year-old Elinor Lester, one of hundreds of campers, told the Associated Press. "A helicopter landed and started taking people away. It was really scary."

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has vowed that rescuers "won't stop until we find every girl who was in those cabins" at Camp Mystic.

In a separate post, Pfluger praised the heroism of camp counselors and others who acted to save lives during the height of the flooding.

"There are countless heroes who acted so bravely during this tragic situation – who sacrificed for others – thank you… and for most of you we will never even know the stories or understand what you did! But, THANK YOU!" the congressman wrote.

Pfluger said Camp Mystic's co-owner, Dick Eastland, sacrificed his life to save the girls attending the camp.

"Camp Mystic's Dick Eastland no doubt gave his life attempting to save his campers," Pfluger wrote in a third post.. "For decades he and his wife Tweety poured his life into loving and developing girls and women of character. Thank you Mr. Eastland. We love you and miss you."

The flooding in Kerr County killed at least 59 people, including 21 children. Officials confirmed at least another eight people died in nearby counties.

Other stories of heroism have begun to surface as the floodwaters recede in Texas.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry praised Emma Foltz, a resident of Alexandria, Louisiana, and a senior at Louisiana Tech University, who has worked as a camp counselor at Camp Mystic in Texas for three years.

"She played an instrumental role in helping evacuate 14 of her campers to safety," Landry wrote in a Facebook post. "Please join me in thanking Emma for all her hard work and bravery under immense pressure."

Elsewhere in Kerr County, a family helped save a woman's life after she was swept 20 miles downriver and clung to a tree for hours in the deadly flash flooding.

Pfluger asked the public to "pray for miracles" as crews continue searching for survivors of the floods, including 11 young girls and one counselor missing from Camp Mystic.

Ben Shelton may have secured his place in the sibling hall of fame. 

After defeating Hungarian tennis player Marton Fucsovics in straight sets in his third-round match at Wimbledon on Saturday, Shelton made a pitch to investment bank Morgan Stanley to have his lucky charm hang around for one more week.

"I've been playing well this week. It's not just been me here. I have a great team. My parents are here. My girlfriend's here. Also, my sister's here. She's been here for every match that I've played this tournament so far. She's been the lucky charm," Shelton said of his sister, Emma.

"But she has work back in the U.S., starting on Monday. She works for Morgan Stanley."

The revelation was met with boos from the crowd, but Shelton interrupted to make his pitch.

"If any of y'all have some (connections) and get her a couple extra days off so she can (stay). We can keep this rolling, that'd be great," he said with a laugh.

The heartwarming plea, in fact, worked. 

"Yeah, you got the week off or what?" Shelton said in a video posted to his Instagram Stories. In response, his sister was seen jumping up and down in excitement, seemingly confirming that her PTO was approved. 

"Shout out, Morgan Stanley," Shelton said as the video ended.

            • Search widens: Authorities are still racing to find victims of yesterday's flash flooding in central Texas, including 27 people from Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp in Kerr County. Gov. Greg Abbott said the state's focus remains on a “relentless” search for survivors as floodwaters recede in some areas.
    


            • Rising death toll: At least 50 people, including 15 children, have died in the flooding, according to local officials. The families of four campers have confirmed their deaths to CNN, while others are enduring an excruciating wait for news on their children.
    


            • Federal response: The Trump administration will honor a federal disaster declaration signed by Abbott to help direct relief to Texas, after the president denied some other requests this year and has sought to shift the burden of disaster response onto states.
    


            • On the ground: A CNN team visited the area  of Camp Mystic to survey the flood damage. Watch here.

            Families are holding out hope that their loved ones are found safe after they went missing at an RV park in Kerrville, Texas, when devastating floods hit the area.
    


            Several people were reported missing from HTR TX Hill Country Campground as a number of campsites in central Texas were engulfed in floodwaters.
    


            Brad Perry was last seen around 5 a.m. on July 4, his son Alex Perry told CNN. The deluges began the evening before and continued overnight.
    


            Allison Edwards said her dad Steve Edwards was also last seen at the campground in the early morning on July 4, around the same time a flash flood emergency warning was issued in Kerr County.
    


                    “He is the best father, son, friend, and dog dad who never met a stranger,” Allison Edwards said. “He would give you the shirt off his back. He's a fighter and I know we are going to get answers and find him.”
                





            Before the heavy rain and flooding inundated the area, Melissa and Rob Kamin may have tried to leave the campground, their daughter Lorel Carr said.
    


            “My papa (Melissa's dad) mentioned that they might have tried to evacuate before the storm hit,” Carr said.
    


            At least four people have died in Travis County, Texas, after catastrophic flooding inundated parts of the area, authorities said Saturday night.
    


            Severe flooding has now killed at least 50 people in Texas, including 43 in Kerr County and three in Burnet County.
    


            Gov. Greg Abbott on Saturday signed an expanded disaster declaration, including Travis County. The county is about 130 miles northeast of hard-hit Kerr County.
    


                    “Remember – turn around, don't drown! As rain continues, be extremely cautious if you have to be out and about,” Travis County posted on social media Saturday.
                





            Travis County Judge Andy Brown told residents to “avoid flooded roads, stay tuned to official alerts, & do not attempt to return to affected areas until officials declare them safe.”
    


            The Travis County Office of Emergency Management continues to conduct search and rescue operations amid devastating flooding, Brown said.
    


            Three people are dead and two are still missing in Burnet County, Texas, Saturday after torrential rainfall caused substantial flooding, county Emergency Management Coordinator Derek Marchio told CNN.
    


            The county has suffered damage to major roadways and bridges, Marchio said.
    


            Following widespread power outages, some people are seeing their power restored Saturday evening, Marchio added.
    


            Earlier in the day, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed an expanded disaster declaration to include Burnet and five other counties.
    


            The deaths reported in Burnet County bring the death toll up to 46, with 43 fatalities reported about 114 miles away in Kerr County.
    


            Hearing the screams of a woman outside of his Texas home, Carl Jeter immediately leaped into action.
    


            The woman, who was on a camping trip with her family on the Guadalupe River, was swept away by floodwaters and separated from her family, Jeter told CNN. She was in the water for about four hours – stuck under debris-ridden water and passing several dams and a road – before pulling herself onto a tree many miles away from the campsite.
    


                    “I'm gonna get help,” Jeter told the woman who he spotted from his deck. “We're gonna make sure we get you out of there.”
                





            He then dialed 911.
    


            Thirty minutes later, authorities still hadn't arrived, so Jeter got in his car and flagged down a Department of Public Safety officer in the area. A swift water team arrived later, securing a life vest on the woman before she jumped from the tree into the team's boat.
    


            After Jeter helped rescue the woman, she waited at his home for a few hours until a family member picked her up and took her to the hospital.
    


                    “It's a true miracle,” Jeter said. “We've been on the river for a long time and that's not something that is survivable.”
                





            The father of Blair, 13, and Brooke Harber, 11 has confirmed to CNN his daughters have died. Blair and Brooke, pictured left to right, went missing during the catastrophic flooding in Kerr County, Texas.
    


            Neither girl was attending Camp Mystic at the time of their disappearance.
    


                    Blair “was a gifted student and had a generous kind heart,” RJ Harber told CNN. Brooke “was like a light in any room, people gravitated to her and she made them laugh and enjoy the moment.”
                





            RJ Harber's parents, Charlene and Mike Harber, are still missing but he believes the couple is deceased, he told CNN.
    


            Search and rescue operations remain the priority in central Texas, according to Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice, as crews continue to look for the missing along the Guadalupe River.
    


                    “We're really focused on life safety,” he said. “Our primary focus is on search and rescue of every single person involved, and we'll continue through the night to make sure that happens.”
                





            He added authorities were recovering and identifying bodies Saturday. “We knew today was going to be that day, so our numbers are going to constantly be changing,” he said.
    


            “We're in a marathon, and we got to make sure we always think about that and look after each other,” Rice said.
    


            There are still 27 children missing from Camp Mystic, Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said at a Saturday news conference, as officials rescue people from campsites after the Guadalupe River surged Friday.
    


            “We've been rescuing people out of these camps by the hundreds all day,” Rice said.
    


            The private Christian summer camp is nestled near the Guadalupe River, which rose more than 20 feet in less than two hours during torrential rains Friday that triggered flash flooding in parts of Texas.
    


            Everyone at the approximately 18 other nearby camps along the river has been accounted for, officials previously said.
    


            Rice said the holiday weekend complicates counting missing people outside of the total missing from Camp Mystic, so officials won't be providing that number.
    


            “Campers are coming in for Fourth of July weekend, people are camped along the river bank, people are coming in to visit – there's a number that we just don't know yet,” he said. “We're not going to put a cap on this; we'll just continue until we find everything else.”
    


            At least 43 people died in Kerr County, Texas, after severe flooding hit the state, according to Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha.
    


            The fatalities include 28 adults and 15 children, Leitha said at a news conference Saturday. The sheriff added five children and 12 adults have yet to be identified.
    


                    “We knew today was going to be that day, so our numbers are going to constantly be changing,” Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said. “We are constantly working on identification.”
                





            Officials in Texas will hold what they expect will be their last news conference of the day at 6 p.m. CT (7 p.m. ET) in Kerrville. Authorities will provide updates on the state's response to severe flooding impacting parts of Texas as search and rescue efforts continue.
    


            The official death toll has risen further following catastrophic flooding in parts of central Texas.
    


            At least 32 people, including 14 children, have died, according to local officials. There are still more than two dozen people missing from Camp Mystic, a girls summer camp in Kerr County.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed an expanded disaster declaration today, adding six new counties, and vowed to continue adding others as needed.

            A US Congressman says his two daughters were evacuated from Camp Mystic, the hard-hit summer camp for girls in Hunt, Texas, where more than 20 campers are still missing.
    


            Rep. August Pfluger announced he and his wife were “now reunited” with their daughters in a post on X Saturday.
    


            “The last day has brought unimaginable grief to many families and we mourn with them as well as holding out hope for survivors,” he wrote.
    


            “Please join us today as we pray for miracles,” he added.
    


            CNN's Ed Lavandera got a firsthand look at the destruction from flooding at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas, where the Guadalupe River rose more than 20 feet in less than two hours during torrential rains that triggered flash flooding in parts of the state yesterday.
    


            More than 20 campers remain unaccounted for after the disaster.
    


Watch Lavandera's report below:



            Renee Smajstrla, the 8-year-old Camp Mystic camper who went missing during the torrential flooding in Kerr County, Texas, has passed away, her family confirmed to CNN.
    


            “It's truly devastating,” Shawn Salta, Smajstrla's uncle, told CNN.
    


            Salta said his niece was recovered on Friday.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the government response and the National Weather Service in the wake of the tragic flooding in Texas that has left 32 people dead, including 14 children.
    


            “When President Trump took office…he said he wanted to fix, and is currently upgrading the technology. And the National Weather Service has indicated that with that and NOAA, that we needed to renew this ancient system that has been left in place with the federal government for many, many years, and that is the reforms that are ongoing,” Noem said.
    


            The president's Fiscal Year 2026 budget, which the administration is already abiding by, does make cuts and even closes some weather research labs that are vital to forecast improvement. The Department of Government Efficiency, formerly led by Elon Musk, has also cut hundreds of employees at NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the NWS.
    


            Asked about the impact of those cuts during a press conference Saturday, Noem continued to defend the government and the president, saying that she will bring “concerns back to the federal government.”
    


            “I do carry your concerns back to the federal government, and to President Trump, and we will do all we can to fix those kind of things that that may have felt like a failure to you and to your community members, but we know that everybody wants more warning time, and that's why we're working to upgrade the technologies have been neglected by far too long,” Noem said.
    


            Still, this storm was extremely unpredictable and truly unprecedented, the water rising very high very quickly.
    


            As CNN has previously reported, the NWS issued a flood watch early Thursday afternoon that highlighted Kerr County as a place at high risk of flash flooding through the overnight. A flash flood warning was issued for Kerr County as early as around 1 a.m. CT on Friday. A more dire flash flood emergency warning was then issued for Kerr County at 4:03 a.m. CT, followed by another one for Kerrville at 5:34 a.m. CT.
    


Correction: This post has been updated to reflect that Trump's fiscal year budget is what affects the National Weather Service.



            As flood waters recede in central Texas, ground crews are able to uncover and search additional areas, Texas Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said.
    


                    “The entire river is being searched from the northernmost impact all the way as we run down. You have assets in the air that are still doing searches. You have boats that are in the water doing searches. And you have ground crews doing searches,” Kidd said.
                





            Dogs are also assisting in searching banks where people may be missing, Kidd said. Crews are assigned to different areas and are reporting back to command if they find anyone, he added.
    


                    “That process is going to keep going,” he said at a news conference Saturday. “We are not stopping until we find everyone that's missing.”
                





            At least 32 people, including 14 children, are dead following torrential rains and flooding in Texas, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said at a Saturday news conference.
    


            The sheriff's office is working to identify some of the deceased, Leitha said. Officials are still working to locate the 27 people still missing from Camp Mystic, he added.
    


            The private Christian summer camp is nestled near the Guadalupe River, which surged suddenly on Friday amid relentless rainfall. Everyone at the approximately 18 other nearby camps along the river has been accounted for, officials previously said.
    


            Camp Mystic, located in the unincorporated community of Hunt in western Kerr County, Texas, hosts approximately 750 children.
    


            Officials said Saturday afternoon that search efforts will continue until everyone who is missing is found.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott underscored the urgent focus on finding survivors of the devastating floods during a press conference Saturday, and said he is directing all state agencies involved to prioritize lifesaving operations.
    


            “My instruction to every state agency involved in this is to assume everybody who is missing is alive,” Abbott said. “And there's a need for speed, not just every hour, every minute counts, which is why there's people in the air, people in the water, people on the ground right now, because they're looking to save every last life.”
    


            Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, echoed the governor's message, making it clear while the shift from rescue to recovery operations will eventually be necessary, the current mindset is firmly focused on rescue.
    


            “History would tell us that after a certain time period, those chances (of survival) diminish,” Kidd said. “Our hope and prayer is that there are still people alive that are out there, and we're still actively searching for them.”
    


            US Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said state officials are “far from having finished the job” of search, rescue and recovery after deadly floods hit the state.
    


                    “We're all here knowing that we still have work to do. We're still prayerful, we're still hopeful,” Roy said during a news conference today.
                





            Authorities say more than 20 girls are still unaccounted for at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas. Roy noted the “heroic efforts of people that worked in those camps, directors of the camps, people who own the camps, who not just risk their lives, gave their lives to try to go save the lives of those kids, that's who they are as Texans.”
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem addressed the ongoing federal response to the catastrophic flooding in Texas, emphasizing the urgent need for resources, coordination and continued federal support as the search for missing people intensifies.
    


            In addition to ground efforts, federal officials have requested more aviation assets to aid in aerial search and rescue.
    


            “We, just at the request of a previous conversation less than an hour ago … requested more fixed-wing aircraft from the Coast Guard to come and help us,” Noem said. She added many of the aircraft will be equipped with thermal imaging to allow round-the-clock searches.
    


            “Some of the assets that other agencies may offer don't have that kind of equipment but the Coast Guard does have it so that will be deployed so that the search and rescue efforts don't stop even when it does get dark at night.”
    


            She reassured Texans FEMA would remain fully engaged and ready to provide additional assistance based on evolving needs from state leadership.
    


            “We'll continue to stay engaged, and I'll be here,” Noem said, noting her plans to visit Camp Mystic, where more than 20 girls are still unaccounted for, along with other parts of the community to assess damage and offer support.
    


            “The number one priority now is people,” Noem stated. “(It) is making sure we're finding people as fast as possible and we're returning them to their families.”
    


            While damage assessments to infrastructure are ongoing as bridges, roads and power lines have all sustained impact, she said the focus remains on saving lives before turning fully to long-term recovery.
    


            “The state of Texas is amazing in how it responds to disasters,” she said. “You are an example to the nation of getting through these difficult times. But also know that you're not alone, that you have the entire country's hearts with you.”

President Donald Trump has faced various legal setbacks early in his second term which have been exacerbated through court shopping by his opponents, but a recent Supreme Court decision could help offer some relief.

Court shopping, also known as forum shopping or judge shopping, has been a frequently used tactic by opponents of the Trump administration seeking favorable rulings and quick blocks of key parts of Trump's agenda. 

The tactic involves parties suing the administration to file their lawsuits in a federal judicial district with a heavily liberal bench of judges. Because the federal government has jurisdiction over the entire country, groups can file lawsuits against the government in a wider array of districts than in typical cases.

Lawsuits challenging Trump executive orders and actions have been filed in federal districts across the country, but several courts have been frequent venues for the opponents of Trump's agenda to file against the administration.

The U.S. District Courts for the District of Columbia, the District of Massachusetts, the Northern District of California, the District of Maryland, and the Southern District of New York, have popped up as the most common venues for legal challenges against the Trump administration, they also happen to be courts where a Democrat appointee is more likely to preside.

In the District of Columbia, there are only four Trump-appointed judges, while the rest of the bench is dominated by appointees of former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Bill Clinton, while the District of Maryland only has one Trump appointee and a bench similarly stacked with Democrat-appointed judges. The Southern District of New York also only has four Trump appointees, while the District of Massachusetts and the Northern District of California have no Trump-appointed judges on the bench.

Zack Smith, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Florida and Senior Legal Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, believes liberal groups and opponents suing Trump have been “strategic in where they filed their lawsuits.”

“Many of these lawsuits are being filed in places like California, Washington State, New York, Boston, other courts around the country where I suspect litigants are more likely to get a favorable with those challenging these policies, expect to get a more favorable judge who might be more inclined to rule in their favor,” Smith told the Washington Examiner.

When Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) launched a lawsuit against Trump's deployment of the National Gaurd to Los Angeles, he and other state officials filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The state officials filed in that court rather than the eastern district of California, where the state capital of Sacramento is located, or in the central district of California, where Los Angeles is located.

The Justice Department argued in a court filing that the state had “engaged in forum shopping in making San Francisco the venue for their lawsuit about Los Angeles,” requesting discovery in the case be conducted in the Central District of California.

“Nearly every fact relevant to this dispute occurred in the Central District of California, and the consequences of the final judgment entered in this case will be felt by those who live in that district. But Plaintiffs nonetheless chose to sue in San Francisco, which has emerged as a favorite forum for those challenging this administration's policies,” the DOJ argued in a June 25 filing.

“Their gamesmanship at the expense of citizens impacted by the case and witnesses should not be permitted,” the filing continued.

Judge Charles Breyer, a Clinton appointee, rejected the bid to transfer the discovery to the other court, noting it would force the other court to quickly get up to speed on the case and called the DOJ's accusation of court shopping “conclusory.”

A major issue with court shopping is that groups and persons bringing lawsuits are inclined to bring them in venues they believe can hear the case and may be favorable for their desired outcome.

“I think litigants are always going to seek to find the most favorable form they can to bring their claims in their claims that this was part and parcel of litigation process,” Smith said.

While conservatives and Trump allies have raged over court shopping early into his term, as John Shu, a constitutional law scholar who served in both Bush administrations, noted to the Washington Examiner, that “sometimes, but not as often, conservatives are guilty of the same” tactics.

“There's plenty of hypocrisy to go around on both sides,” Shu said. “I think this court shopping business is really terrible.”

During the Biden administration, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas became a popular place for conservative groups to file lawsuits, hoping to have Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, assigned to their case.

Kacsmaryk granted legal wins and universal injunctions to conservative groups in several key cases during the Biden administration, including maintaining the “remain in Mexico” policy from Trump's first term and halting the FDA approval of the popular abortion pill mifepristone.

“He's pretty conservative, and before he became a judge, when he was an advocate, he had written plenty of articles about being pro-life,” Shu said.

“So [the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine] sued there, and obviously they got their nationwide injunction on mifepristone. They eventually lost at the Supreme Court on standing, but they still managed to get their district court nationwide injunction,” Shu added. “When they did that all the liberals were upset about nationwide injunctions.”

During the Biden administration, left-leaning law professors, scholars, and politicians raged against the tactic. Georgetown University Law professor Stephen Vladeck, writing for the New York Times in 2023, that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had “made the loophole into an art form” with getting his cases before Kacsmaryk.

Justice Elena Kagan, a part of the liberal wing of the high court, expressed her concern over forum shopping and district courts issuing universal injunctions to halt presidential or congressional actions during a talk at Northwestern University's law school in 2022.

“It just can't be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks, and leave it stopped for the years that it takes to go through normal process,” Kagan said, lamenting how people “forum shop” which district court they file in.

When Trump returned to power in January, and the flurry of cases were filed against Trump in liberal judicial districts, much of the uproar from the legal left-wing over forum shopping has quitted, as some legal scholars argue it has become a more prevalent problem in the past 6 months.

“There's a particular focus on several lawsuits that were filed during the Biden administration in Texas, in front of Judge Kacsmaryk, there's a lot of anger and frustration expressed by many on the left because of that,” Smith said, while noting where liberal groups have filed lawsuits during the second Trump term.

“It looks like the left has engaged in those same types of strategic decisions, trying to find the friendliest forum to follow their cases in, and yet, you haven't heard the same type of outcry that you heard from many of the commentators that commented on this during the Biden administration,” he added.

Shu noted how liberal groups are more aggressive with the tactic of court shopping, but that the significant number of liberal courts where those groups can file also exacerbates it.

“It's really out of hand, and in the past, both conservative and liberals have gone forum shopping, court shopping, but the liberals are super aggressive about it, and I think it's because they have more judges,” Shu told the Washington Examiner. “They have more jurisdictions where they can file to get the results they want.”

While there are no firm ways to end the abuse of forum shopping, the Supreme Court's decision last month limiting the use of nationwide injunctions is an “important win” in curbing the practice, Smith told the Washington Examiner.

The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in Trump v. CASA that universal injunctions, blocking laws or policies from being enforced against anyone, “likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to federal courts.” The ruling, in a case which originated out of a trio of universal injunctions against Trump's birthright citizenship order, has taken a key power out of district courts' hands.

Smith said he hopes the high court's ruling will “ameliorate some of the concerns about judge shopping or foreign shopping” by providing the death knell to universal injunctions. He is optimistic it will lower the stakes of which forum a case is heard in.

“The stakes are much higher if you can get a single federal district court judge from anywhere in the country to issue a nationwide injunction, and so if that tool is taken away, hopefully that might lower the temperature, lower the stakes around some of the forum selection that we've seen so far,” Smith said.

SUPREME COURT'S DEATH KNELL TO UNIVERSAL INJUNCTIONS CHANGES TRUMP LEGAL LANDSCAPE

Shu also agreed that the decision in Trump v. CASA is a positive development, but with other avenues for sweeping relief, including class action lawsuits, court shopping may still persist in the legal battles against the Trump administration.

“I think it's a good thing that the Supreme Court ruled the way it did on nationwide injunctions, and I hope we will see a reduction in forum shopping and court shopping,” Shu said.  

“Only time will tell,” Shu added, “but I certainly hope it happens.”

KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) — Rescuers scoured a devastated central Texas landscape of mangled trees, overturned cars and muck-filled debris Saturday in an increasingly bleak mission to locate survivors, including 27 girls who have not been seen since their camp was slammed with a wall of water in a historic flash flood.

The flooding in Kerr County killed at least 43 people, including 15 children, and at least eight people died in nearby counties.

Authorities still have not said how many people were missing beyond the children from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along a river in Kerr County where most of the dead were recovered.

The destructive, fast-moving waters rose 26 feet (8 meters) on the Guadalupe River in just 45 minutes before daybreak Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as rains continued pounding communities outside San Antonio on Saturday and flash flood warnings and watches remained in effect.

Searchers used helicopters, boats and drones to look for victims and to rescue people stranded in trees and from camps isolated by washed-out roads. 

Gov. Greg Abbott vowed that authorities will work around the clock and said new areas were being searched as the water receded. He declared Sunday a day of prayer for the state. 




“I urge every Texan to join me in prayer this Sunday — for the lives lost, for those still missing, for the recovery of our communities, and for the safety of those on the front lines,” he said in a statement.




Authorities were coming under scrutiny over whether the camps and residents in places long vulnerable to flooding received proper warning and whether enough preparations were made.

The hills along the Guadalupe River in central Texas are dotted with century-old youth camps and campgrounds where generations of families have come to swim and enjoy the outdoors. The area is especially popular around the July Fourth holiday, making it more difficult to know how many are missing.

“We don't even want to begin to estimate at this time,” Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said earlier.

“The camp was completely destroyed,” said Elinor Lester, 13, one of hundreds of campers. “A helicopter landed and started taking people away. It was really scary.”

The raging storm, fueled by incredible amounts of moisture, woke up her cabin just after midnight Friday. When rescuers arrived, they tied a rope for the girls to hold as they walked across a bridge with water whipping around their legs, she said. 

Frantic parents and families posted photos of missing loved ones and pleas for information. 

Among those confirmed dead were an 8-year-old girl from Mountain Brook, Alabama, who was at Camp Mystic, and the director of another camp just up the road.

The flooding in the middle of the night caught many residents, campers and officials by surprise. 

AccuWeather said the private forecasting company and the National Weather Service sent warnings about potential flash flooding hours beforehand. 

“These warnings should have provided officials with ample time to evacuate camps such as Camp Mystic and get people to safety,” AccuWeather said in a statement. It called the Hill Country one of the most flash-flood-prone areas of the U.S. because of its terrain and many water crossings.

At the Mo-Ranch Camp in the community of Hunt, officials had been monitoring the weather and opted to move several hundred campers and attendees at a church youth conference to higher ground. At nearby Camps Rio Vista and Sierra Vista, organizers also had mentioned on social media that they were watching the weather the day before wrapping up their second summer session Thursday.

Authorities and elected officials have said they did not expect such an intense downpour, the equivalent of months' worth of rain for the area.

U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, whose district includes the ravaged area, called it a once-in-a-century flood and acknowledged that there would be second-guessing and finger-pointing as people look for someone to blame.





Search crews were facing harsh conditions while “looking in every possible location,” Rice said. 

Officials said more than 850 people had been rescued in the last 36 hours and there were heroic efforts at the camps to save children.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem arrived and pledged that the Trump administration would use all available resources. Coast Guard helicopters and planes were assisting to ensure operations can continue even in darkness.

One reunification center at an elementary school was mostly quiet after taking in hundreds of evacuees the day before.

“We still have people coming here looking for their loved ones. We've had a little success, but not much,” said Bobby Templeton, superintendent of Ingram Independent School District.





In Ingram, Erin Burgess woke to thunder and rain in the middle of the night. Just 20 minutes later, water was pouring into her home, she said. She described an agonizing hour clinging to a tree with her teen son.

“My son and I floated to a tree where we hung onto it, and my boyfriend and my dog floated away. He was lost for a while, but we found them,” she said.

Barry Adelman said water pushed everyone in his three-story house into the attic, including his 94-year-old grandmother and 9-year-old grandson. 

“I was having to look at my grandson in the face and tell him everything was going to be OK, but inside I was scared to death,” he said. 

Locals know the place as “ flash flood alley.” 

“When it rains, water doesn't soak into the soil,” said Austin Dickson, CEO of the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, which was collecting donations. “It rushes down the hill.”

The weekend forecast had called for rain, with a flood watch upgraded to a warning overnight Friday for at least 30,000 people.

“We know we get rains. We know the river rises. But nobody saw this coming,” said Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, the county's chief elected official.

The county had considered a flood warning system on the river similar to a tornado warning siren about six or seven years ago, but Kelly said the idea never got off the ground and the cost would have been an issue.

Kelly said he was heartbroken seeing body bags at the funeral home and the devastation on the ground during a helicopter tour. 

“The rescue has gone as well as can be expected. It's getting time now for the recovery,” he said. “And that's going to be a long, toilsome task for us.”

KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) — Before heading to bed before the Fourth of July holiday, Christopher Flowers checked the weather while staying at a friend's house along the Guadalupe River. Nothing in the forecast alarmed him.

Hours later, he was rushing to safety: He woke up in darkness to electrical sockets popping and ankle-deep water. Quickly, his family scrambled nine people into the attic. Phones buzzed with alerts, Flowers recalled Saturday, but he did not remember when in the chaos they started.

“What they need is some kind of external system, like a tornado warning that tells people to get out now,” Flowers, 44, said.

The destructive fast-moving waters that began before sunrise Friday in the Texas Hill Country killed at least 43 people in Kerr County, authorities said Saturday, and an unknown number of people remained missing. Those still unaccounted for included 27 girls from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along a river in Kerr County where most of the dead were recovered.

But as authorities launch one of the largest search-and-rescue efforts in recent Texas history, they have come under intensifying scrutiny over preparations and why residents and youth summer camps that are dotted along the river were not alerted sooner or told to evacuate. 

The National Weather Service sent out a series of flash flood warnings in the early hours Friday before issuing flash flood emergencies — a rare alert notifying of imminent danger.




Local officials have insisted that no one saw the flood potential coming and have defended their actions. 

“There's going to be a lot of finger-pointing, a lot of second-guessing and Monday morning quarterbacking,” said Republican U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, whose district includes Kerr County. “There's a lot of people saying ‘why' and ‘how,' and I understand that.”

An initial flood watch — which generally urges residents to be weather-aware — was issued by the local National Weather Service office at 1:18 p.m. Thursday.

It predicted between 5 to 7 inches (12.7 to 17.8 centimeters) of rain. Weather messaging from the office, including automated alerts delivered to mobile phones to people in threatened areas, grew increasingly ominous in the early morning hours of Friday, urging people to move to higher ground and evacuate flood-prone areas, said Jason Runyen, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service office.

At 4:03 a.m., the office issued an urgent warning that raised the potential of catastrophic damage and a severe threat to human life.

Jonathan Porter, the chief meteorologist at AccuWeather, a private weather forecasting company that uses National Weather Service data, said it appeared evacuations and other proactive measures could have been undertaken to reduce the risk of fatalities.

“People, businesses, and governments should take action based on Flash Flood Warnings that are issued, regardless of the rainfall amounts that have occurred or are forecast,” Porter said in a statement.

Local officials have said they had not expected such an intense downpour that was the equivalent of months' worth of rain for the area.

“We know we get rains. We know the river rises,” said Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, the county's top elected official. “But nobody saw this coming.”

Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said he was jogging along the river early in the morning and didn't notice any problems at 4 a.m. A little over an hour later, at 5:20 a.m., the water level had risen dramatically and “we almost weren't able to get out of the park,” he said. 

Rice also noted that the public can become desensitized to too many weather warnings.

Kelly said the county considered a flood warning system along the river that would have functioned like a tornado warning siren about six or seven years ago, before he was elected, but that the idea never got off the ground because of the expense. 

“We've looked into it before … The public reeled at the cost,” Kelly said.

He said he didn't know what kind of safety and evacuation plans the camps may have had.

“What I do know is the flood hit the camp first, and it came in the middle of the night. I don't know where the kids were,” he said. “I don't know what kind of alarm systems they had. That will come out in time.”

U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said Saturday it was difficult for forecasters to predict just how much rain would fall. She said the Trump administration would make it a priority to upgrade National Weather Service technology used to deliver warnings.

“We know that everyone wants more warning time, and that's why we're working to upgrade the technology that's been neglected for far too long to make sure families have as much advance notice as possible,” Noem said during a press conference with state and federal leaders. 

The National Weather Service office in New Braunfels, which delivers forecasts for Austin, San Antonio and the surrounding areas, had extra staff on duty during the storms, Runyen said. 

Where the office would typically have two forecasters on duty during clear weather, they had up to five on staff.

“There were extra people in here that night, and that's typical in every weather service office — you staff up for an event and bring people in on overtime and hold people over,” Runyen said.

Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman reports on the arrests of two individuals in Los Angeles with alleged ties to a human smuggling hub on 'Fox Report.'

An American national with credentials that read "CIA" has been arrested in Mexico on weapons charges, Mexican authorities said Saturday. 

The unidentified man was arrested "for his probable involvement in the crimes of disturbing the peace and possession of weapons designated for exclusive use by the Army," according to the Secretariat of Security of the State of Mexico.

Authorities found six firearms, magazines, live ammunition and tactical equipment, the agency said.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem joins ‘Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss protesters clashing with ICE officers during federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, and the response by local leaders.

The Trump administration is taking a "zero tolerance" approach to attacks on law enforcement after a Texas police officer was shot outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center.

The message came after similar incidents in other cities amid backlash against President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement agency. 

An Alvarado, Texas, police officer was shot Friday night near the Prairieland Detention Facility, authorities said.

"We are closely monitoring the attacks on DHS detention facilities in Prairieland, TX, and Portland, OR, and are coordinating with the [US Attorney offices] and our law enforcement partners," said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on X.

"The Department [of Justice] has zero tolerance for assaults on federal officers or property and will bring the full weight of the law against those responsible," he added.

In Alvarado, a suburb of Fort Worth, several suspects were arrested after an officer with the Alvarado Police Department was shot at around 11 p.m. while responding to reports of a suspicious person, FOX Dallas reported. 

When the officer tried making contact with the person, shots were fired and the officer was struck in the neck. 

The officer was flown to a Fort Worth hospital for treatment and was later released.

The Trump administration deported eight migrants convicted of various crimes to South Sudan after weeks of legal back-and-forth between district courts, the Justice Department, and ultimately the Supreme Court, which twice ruled the deportations could take place.

At around 8:30 p.m. Eastern time on July 4, a military plane carrying the eight migrants departed the U.S. military base in Djibouti, where they were held as the deportation effort was delayed by lower court stays and injunctions. The plane arrived in South Sudan less than four hours later, shortly before midnight on Friday, according to CBS News.

A photo later shared by the Department of Homeland Security showed the migrants, all handcuffed, aboard the plane and surrounded by military officials.

The migrants' arrival in South Sudan came mere hours after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., issued an administrative stay on the deportation effort, barring DHS from “moving, transferring, or removing” the eight men while the court considered a new constitutional challenge to their removal.

That new challenge was an emergency habeas petition, which argued that sending the men to the war-torn African nation would amount to unlawful punishment in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth amendments.

Following his stay on the deportation effort, however, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss moved the case to Massachusetts, where U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy reportedly had the final word before the scheduled deportation flight and a threat of another appeal to the Supreme Court by the DOJ if it was blocked again.

Murphy ultimately denied the migrants' attorney's request for a temporary restraining order on their deportations to South Sudan, citing an earlier Supreme Court ruling.

“This Court interprets these Supreme Court orders as binding on this new petition, as Petitioners are now raising substantially similar claims, and therefore Petitioners motion is denied,” Murphy said in the ruling.

Murphy's ruling paved the way for the migrants' removal to the East African Country, which the Supreme Court had already greenlit in two separate rulings.

Both of those orders from the high court involved previous rulings from Murphy.

In late June, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to resume deporting criminal migrants to “third countries,” or places where they did not originate, including South Sudan. That included granting an emergency request from the DOJ to block a lower court ruling from Murphy that required the administration to give deportees a “meaningful opportunity” to raise fear-based claims before being sent to countries where they face torture or death.

JUDGE TEMPORARILY HALTS SOUTH SUDAN DEPORTATIONS DESPITE TRUMP WINS AT SUPREME COURT

In the second ruling, the Supreme Court ruled late this week that Murphy overstepped by trying to block the South Sudan deportations despite the previous order.

All of the eight migrants deported to South Sudan have been convicted of serious crimes in the United States. Only one of them is from South Sudan, while the others are from Vietnam, Mexico, Laos, Cuba, and Myanmar.

            The forces that descended upon the Guadalupe River in Texas' Hill Country on Thursday night were a worst-case scenario.
    


            Four months' worth of rain fell in just hours as water-laden thunderstorms stalled in place, giving rise to a wall of water that surged down the river in the blackness of night, limiting the number of people who could get the warnings and move to higher ground.
    


            The National Weather Service warned of “life-threatening flooding” along the river in a series of alerts in the early morning hours. But questions remain about how many people they reached, whether critical vacancies at the forecast offices could have affected warning dissemination, and if so-called warning fatigue had been growing among residents in a region described as one of the most dangerous in the country for flash flooding.
    


            The National Weather Service has been hard hit by personnel cuts under the Trump administration, but that may not have significantly affected the forecasts and warnings for this historic and deadly flooding.
    


            The two Texas NWS offices most closely involved in forecasting and warning about the flooding on the Guadalupe River — Austin-San Antonio and San Angelo — are missing some key staff members, but still issued a slew of watches and warnings about the flood danger.
    


            The question is whether the warnings reached who they needed to reach.
    


            Tom Fahy, the legislative director for the NWS employees' union, told CNN that while he believes the offices had “adequate staffing and resources,” the Austin-San Antonio office is missing a warning coordination meteorologist — a role that serves as a crucial, direct link between forecasters and emergency managers.
    


            This vacancy in the Austin-San Antonio office, along with other key roles, were the result of early retirement incentives offered by the Trump administration to shrink the size of the federal government, a NOAA official told CNN.
    


            The National Weather Service began forecasting the threat of flooding in Kerr County as early as Thursday morning with a hazardous flood outlook.
    


            A flood watch was issued at 1:18 p.m. CT, that highlighted Kerrville, among other locations, as being at risk of flash flooding — though notably, as local officials have raised, the forecast was for less rainfall than what fell: as much as 5 to 7 inches for an event that ultimately dropped as much as 15 inches on parts of central Texas.
    


            Several technical forecasts followed Thursday afternoon and evening with increasingly heightened language about the magnitude of the potential flooding. At 6:30 p.m., river forecasters were calling for locally intense rain rates that would “quickly overwhelm” the ground's ability to absorb the water.
    


            “Rapid runoff is expected, with locally considerable flash and urban flash flooding possible … the nocturnal timing will also enhance the hazard potential and impacts,” the forecasters predicted. They also noted the potential for a historic rainfall event, though it's unclear if that messaging reached emergency managers.
    


            The first warning for “life-threatening flash flooding” for Kerrville came at 1:14 a.m., and was marked specifically to trigger the Emergency Alert System. It would have sounded the alarm on cell phones in the warned area, assuming those phones had service, and their users hadn't turned off EAS weather alerts.
    


            Three hours later, the Kerr County Sheriff's Office sent the first report of flooding at low-water crossings.
    


            Several other critical alerts followed, warning of the imminent threat: A flash flood emergency warning was issued for Kerr County at 4:03 a.m., followed by one for Kerrville at 5:34 a.m.
    


            The raging river burst from its banks around 5 a.m., sweeping homes, cars, campers and cabins downstream. It took about 90 minutes for the 20-foot flood wave to move down the Guadalupe River overnight Thursday, triggering the river's second-highest crest on record.
    


Several NWS offices around the country are worse off than San Angelo or Austin-San Antionio, working with such thin staffing that they no longer operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
    


            Many NWS forecast offices have ceased launching their twice-a-day weather balloons, which provide critical data that can alert forecasters to the potential for flooding and other hazardous weather.
    


            The NOAA official defended the National Weather Service forecasts, and said the disaster ultimately resulted from too much rain in too short of time in one of the most vulnerable spots in the country for flash flooding, and in the overnight hours — the worst time of day to get warnings to people in harm's way.
    


            This particular population is inundated with weather watches and warnings all times of day and night; in Texas Hill Country, where flash flooding is triggered frequently by summertime thunderstorms, warning fatigue can settle in.
    


            The Kerr County tragedy also shines a spotlight on the limitations of current forecasting technology: It is simply not yet possible to predict that a cluster of thunderstorms dumping months' worth of rain would stall out over a specific spot. Research efforts to find answers to these forecasting questions could soon slip backwards, experts warn, if the Trump administration's 2026 budget proposal is enacted — just as the country needs to push the limits on what weather models are capable of.
    


            The budget seeks to eliminate all of NOAA's weather and climate research labs along with institutes jointly run with universities around the country. The entire research division of NOAA would be eliminated under the proposal, which is subject to congressional approval.
    


            This would shut down research and development of new forecasting technologies, including computer modeling and severe weather warning scenarios, and hamper prediction of hazards including flash floods.
    


            One of the NOAA labs slated to be shut down is the National Severe Storms Lab in Norman, Oklahoma, which works to improve flash flood forecasting among other hazards from severe thunderstorms.
    


            The NOAA research cuts would come just as human-caused climate change is resulting in more frequent and intense downpours like the ones that led to this tragedy in Texas.
    


            NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster told CNN the Weather Service provided ample lead time prior to the onset of flash flooding on the Guadalupe River.
    


            “The National Weather Service is heartbroken by the tragic loss of life in Kerr County. On July 3, the NWS office in Austin/San Antonio, TX conducted forecast briefings for emergency management in the morning and issued a Flood Watch in the early afternoon,” Doster said in a statement.
    


            “Flash Flood Warnings were also issued on the night of July 3 and in the early morning of July 4, giving preliminary lead times of more than three hours before flash flooding conditions occurred.”
    


            While the July 4 flooding was worst-case, the scenario is becoming more frequent as the world warms: More rainfall coming faster than it ever has before, with forecast models inherently biased toward what we used to consider “normal.”
    


            For dozens of families, “normal” was shattered Thursday morning when they woke to torrential rain and catastrophic floodwaters that have since left at least 50 dead, including 15 children, according to local officials.
    


            As an intensive search continues for more than 20 girls in Kerr County, Texas, who remain unaccounted for after the historic flood swept dozens from a summer camp, local officials are adamant they could not have done anything more to prevent the tragedy.
    


            Gov. Greg Abbott praised federal and local officials in a long Saturday news conference and defended the response, calling it rapid in the face of a once-in-a-century flood.
    


            “Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming. We have floods all the time,” Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said at a Friday news conference. “We had no reason to believe that this was going to be anything like what's happened here. None whatsoever.”
    


            Kerr County's judge said the county does not have a warning system for flooding, while Kerrville City manager said they “could not anticipate” the severity of the flooding despite the warnings because the event happened so quickly.
    


            “There's going to be a lot of finger-pointing and a lot of second guessing and Monday morning quarterbacking,” said Texas Congressman Chip Roy. “There's a lot of people saying why and how and I understand that. I understand why parents would be asking those questions, and all of the media.”
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the government response and the National Weather Service in a Saturday news conference.
    


            “Everybody knows that the weather is extremely difficult to predict, but also that the National Weather Service, over the years, at times, has done well, and at times, we have all wanted more time and more warning and more alerts and more notification,” Noem said.
    


            The DHS Secretary said President Donald Trump wants to fix and upgrade the technology that the National Weather Service uses.
    


            “The National Weather Service has indicated that with that and NOAA, that we needed to renew this ancient system that has been left in place with the federal government for many, many years, and that is the reforms that are ongoing,” Noem said.
    


            A NOAA official said they did not know specifically what Noem was referring to, but that upgrades to agency computer networks, radars and modeling systems are underway.
    


            Some of those upgrades have been taking place since before Trump took office for his second term.

Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson reports on President Donald Trump's Fourth of July party, the ‘big, beautiful bill' signing and more on ‘Fox Report.'

A fighter jet scrambled by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) intercepted a civilian aircraft Saturday afternoon after it entered restricted airspace over Bedminster, New Jersey, where President Donald Trump is spending the holiday weekend.

The pilot flew into a temporary flight restriction (TFR) zone just before 2:40 p.m. ET, according to a NORAD statement. 

The aircraft was safely escorted out of the area after a standard "headbutt" maneuver was used to get the pilot's attention. The maneuver involves a military jet flying directly in front of a civilian aircraft at a close but safe distance to visually signal the pilot to either follow or change course.

This was the fourth restricted airspace violation of the day and not the last.

NORAD says another incursion happened later, making for five unauthorized entries by five different aircraft in a single day over presidential airspace.

NORAD confirmed a total of three intercepts on July 5. The first took place over the Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA) and was carried out by a U.S. Coast Guard MH-65 Blackjack helicopter. The second, near Bedminster, was the F-16 interception involving the headbutt maneuver. Later, there were two additional intercepts over the SFRA, one by another MH-65 Blackjack, and one involving both an MH-65 and an F-16.

All five aircraft involved were compliant and safely escorted out of restricted airspace, NORAD said.

Officials are warning private pilots to do their homework before takeoff.

"If you're flying anywhere near Bedminster, NJ, you'd better check NOTAMs 1353, 1358, 2246, and 2247," 1st Air Force (America's AOC) posted on X. "No excuses! Stay sharp, stay legal, and stay out of restricted airspace."

In a message to pilots, NORAD stressed: "It is critically important for North American flight safety that Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) violations are avoided. All pilots must familiarize themselves with updates to restricted airspace, including reviewing new and existing FAA NOTAMs that impact their flight plans and activities. Adhering to FAA restricted airspace protocols is mandatory, regardless of geographical region, airframe, or aircrew."

The FAA did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Ben Shelton launched a public plea for his sister to get some extra time off from her job at investment bank Morgan Stanley so she could remain at Wimbledon to cheer for him. It worked.

After advancing to face Italy's Lorenzo Sonego on Monday in the fourth round, Shelton spoke in an on-court interview in front of a crowd that included his sister, Emma, and his girlfriend, U.S. national soccer team star Trinity Rodman.

"I've been playing well this week. It's not just been me here. I have a great team. My parents are here. My girlfriend's here. Also, my sister's here. She's been here for every match that I've played this tournament so far. She's been the lucky charm," said the 10th-seeded Shelton, a 22-year-old American who has appeared in two Grand Slam semifinals. "But she has work back in the U.S., starting on Monday. She works for Morgan Stanley."

That drew some boos from spectators as Emma covered her face with her hands.

"If any of you all have some (connections) and get her a couple extra days off so she can (stay and) we can keep this rolling," Shelton continued after his 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-2 victory over Marton Fucsovics of Hungary on Saturday, "that'd be great."

Sure enough, hours later, Emma posted a short video on Instagram in which Ben is heard asking her, "You got the week off or what?" She jumps up and down with her arms raised and a wide smile, and Ben says, "Shoutout, Morgan Stanley."

The caption reads "thank you MS" with three blue heart emojis and "return flight: cancelled."

Ben Shelton, who won all nine sets he played in Week 1 at the All England Club, beat Sonego in the Australian Open quarterfinals in January.

Elon Musk declared on X the formation of a new political party amid his ongoing feud with President Donald Trump over the "Big Beautiful Bill."

"Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom," Musk wrote in an X post on Saturday afternoon.

The Tesla CEO had said Friday on his social media platform that one way the new party could work is to focus on winning just a handful of Senate seats and House districts that could serve as the "deciding vote" on "contentious laws," given the "razor-thin legislative margins" in Congress.

When asked for comment on Musk's new party, the White House said Trump had "unified" the Republican Party.

"Having earned the largest share of votes for a Republican presidential nominee and secured majorities in the House and Senate, and with his historic domestic policy agenda swiftly and successfully passed through One Big Beautiful Bill with resounding GOP support, the party is stronger than ever and in lockstep with the Trump agenda," Harrison Fields, the principal White House deputy press secretary, told BI over email.

Fellow billionaire Mark Cuban, meanwhile, appeared — not for the first time — to support the idea of a new party, replying to Musk's Saturday announcement with a series of fireworks and fire emojis.

"I work with @voterchoice. They will help you get on ballots. That is their mission," Cuban wrote in another post.

SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House communications director under Trump in 2017, also appeared interested.

"I would like to meet to discuss. My DMs are open," he replied to Musk.

Musk's "America Party" announcement came after he conducted a July 4 poll, asking X users if they want "independence" from the two-party system. About 65% of the 1.25 million participants voted "Yes."

Musk, who was a staunch supporter of Trump's 2024 reelection bid, has been publicly critical of the president's "Big Beautiful Bill," a sweeping domestic policy bill that includes extensive tax cuts and could add more than $3 trillion to the national debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Musk has characterized the bill on X as a form of "debt slavery."

Just days after stepping away from his work at the White House DOGE Office, which was tasked with cutting spending and reducing the deficit, Musk in June called the legislation a "massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill."

Musk then proposed the idea of forming a new political party that represents the "80% in the middle."

Musk's repeated attacks on the bill led to a spectacular public fallout between him and the president. Trump even suggested that his office would look into possibly deporting Musk, a South African immigrant.

Musk's July 4 poll on X came the same day Trump signed the bill into law.

Musk and a White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

Musk's back-and-forth regarding his involvement in political affairs has been followed by volatile times for the CEO of Tesla, his EV company.

Wall Street analysts, including Tesla bull Dan Ives, have said that Musk's politics could lead the company astray if the chief executive doesn't snap back into focus.

Earlier in June, Baird analysts downgraded the Tesla stock, noting that the Musk-Trump spat adds "uncertainty to TSLA's outlook.

You've probably worked hard to build positive relationships. But what if, despite your best intentions, your communication is coming off as judgmental?

As the author of "Managing Up," an executive coach to top performers at the world's biggest companies, and a professor of human behavior, I've seen how certain phrases — even ones that sound perfectly reasonable in your head — can chip away at trust.

People may hesitate to share ideas or information with you. You may stop getting invited to meetings or to social events. And before you know it, you're being labeled as resistant or not a team player. 

Here are five common phrases that can make you sound judgmental, even when you don't mean to be, and what to say instead. 

You may say this when someone brings up a problem that seems to have a straightforward solution. Maybe your friend is stressed about their inbox, and you mention, "Why don't you just set up filters?" Or your direct report is struggling to get buy-in on a decision, and you jump straight to, "Why don't you just schedule one-on-ones?"

You think you're helping, but what the other person hears is: "The answer is obvious, so why haven't you figured it out?" They may need empathy before they're ready to problem-solve.

Get curious before offering solutions. For example: 

Once you understand the situation better, you can then suggest ideas with phrases like: 

At a family gathering, someone mentions, "Grandma grew up in Ohio," and you jump in to clarify, "Actually, it was Michigan." Even small corrections like, "Actually, the deadline is Friday," can come off harsher than intended.

Prefacing statements with "actually" can seem to imply, "You're wrong and I'm right," or, "You're not paying attention," and come off as condescending. 

Embrace "yes, and..." improv energy to build on others' ideas, not tear them down. Try: 

Signal humility with wording like: 

Over dinner you comment to your partner, "If I'm being honest, I had more fun at the show than I thought I would." Or you might use it to express feedback, like: "Honestly, we should consider other options." 

You're trying to be transparent. But saying "to be honest…" can subtly imply everything you said before wasn't truthful. Worse, it often signals criticism is coming, so people might get defensive before you've even made your point.

Drop the preamble and lead with the positive experience:  

If you're offering input, position your opinion as one possible perspective, not the only truth. For example: 

You can also use words that invite open-mindedness like: 

You might say this when someone's explanation or idea doesn't line up with your thinking or experience. For example, maybe a teammate says they're prioritizing a smaller client over a bigger one.

What you mean is, "I don't understand your reasoning," but the subtext can be perceived as, "Your logic is flawed." Even if you're truly confused, this phrase puts the other person in the position of having to defend their intelligence. 

Acknowledge what you do understand or paraphrase what you've heard first. Try: 

You might genuinely be caught off guard when someone isn't aware of information that seems fundamental or well-known to you. Sometimes it's even a nervous reflex if you feel awkward for not catching an oversight sooner. 

By expressing "surprise," you're inadvertently suggesting their lack of knowledge is unexpected and perhaps inappropriate for someone in their role.

Focus on being helpful rather than highlighting their unfamiliarity. Try: 

These phrases aren't always judgmental. Tone and timing matter, too. Be aware of both your intention and your impact and you can become the type of person others trust, respect, and want to invest in.

In this article

President Donald Trump's announcement of a U.S.-Vietnam trade deal and a solid June jobs report lifted stocks last week, but investors can still find plenty of opportunities to snap up names at attractive levels.

The recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help inform investors as they search for the stocks of companies with strong fundamentals and solid growth opportunities.  

Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

This week's first stock pick is Dell Technologies (DELL), a provider of IT hardware, software, and services.

Following meetings with management, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated a buy rating on Dell with a price target of $150. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI analyst has an "outperform" rating on DELL with a price target of $128.

Notably, Daryanani stated that he came away from the meetings incrementally positive about Dell's ability to deliver high-single-digit revenue growth and a double-digit increase in earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow (FCF). His optimism is backed by the initiatives taken by the company over the past two years to optimize its cost structure and tailwinds from key AI (artificial intelligence) investments.

Among the key takeaways from the meetings, the analyst highlighted that the AI server margins are turning out to be better than initially expected, with Dell earning a premium compared to rivals while delivering impressive growth. He also pointed out the company's innovations in its infrastructure offerings, with its internal liquid cooling capabilities becoming a more vital part of its strategy.

Daryanani added that Dell expects to benefit from acceleration in enterprise AI adoption over the next five to seven years. In fact, the company believes that higher-margin enterprise customers could account for the vast majority of AI server sales over time. Daryanani also noted Dell's confidence about navigating tariff woes, given that it "believes its diversified and global footprint is an advantage over its competitors."

Daryanani ranks No. 187 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.8%. See Dell Technologies Stock News and Insights on TipRanks.

We move to Trade Desk (TTD), a cloud-based advertising platform that providers advertisers with cutting-edge technology to find new audiences and grow their brands.

Recently, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney upgraded Trade Desk stock to Buy from Hold with a price forecast of $90. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI analyst has an "outperform" rating on TTD stock, but with a lower price target of $83. Mahaney views the pullback in TTD stock as an attractive buying opportunity "to get involved again in what has proved over time to be one of the highest quality and most consistent performers across the Internet landscape."

Explaining his bullish stance, Mahaney stated that recent checks have indicated that online ad demand sentiment has clearly improved since April/May, though uncertainty about the second half of the year remains significant. He added that the checks reflect a clear improvement in Trade Desk's execution. Also, solid product announcements, like that of Deal Desk, helped address some concerns about the transition from the company's legacy platform Solimar to the AI-powered Kokai platform.

Mahaney mentioned that checks indicated a clear improvement in the company's execution, both on product and go-to-market strategy. While the analyst acknowledged increasing competition from Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP), he highlighted that Google's DV360 and not Trade Desk is more likely to be impacted due to its overlap with the areas where AMZN is strong.   

Finally, Mahaney thinks that Trade Desk's set-ups for the remainder of fiscal 2025 look quite achievable, with his billings analysis suggesting that the company is very likely to exit 2025 at premium growth levels (excluding political spend). He sees significant catalysts for 2026 such as the World Cup, the Winter Olympics and the full-year Kokai impact.

Mahaney ranks No. 214 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 60% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.0%. See Trade Desk Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

This week's third pick is e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN). In a research note dated July 1, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reaffirmed a buy rating and increased the Amazon stock price forecast to $255 from $250. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI analyst has assigned an "outperform" rating on AMZN stock with a price target of $233.

Thill raised his price target after Jefferies' proprietary survey of nearly 700 U.S. consumers in mid-/late June indicated that Amazon "remains resilient despite price increases related to tariffs, with stable spend levels and upside if pricing on other websites becomes more expensive."

The analyst noted that although 80% of the respondents are concerned about prices, the survey reflected a stable spending pattern by most Amazon shoppers (62% spent the same or more in the past three months). However, the survey noted some cost-conscious behavior, as 31% spent less in the past three months.

Thill highlighted that the survey also reflected that Amazon Prime remains the most popular membership and a major loyalty driver for the company. Notably, 73% of respondents reported having a Prime membership, compared to 26% for rival Walmart. He also noted Amazon's superior positioning on fast and free shipping, selection, and low prices.

The analyst said that given the heightened focus on prices, Amazon's Prime Day event could turn out to be more popular and impactful by running for four days instead of two (from July 8 to July 11 vs. July 16 to July 17 in 2024) across 20 countries. He expects the event to result in incremental Prime memberships, particularly among students and young adults ages 18 to 24 via six-month extended free trials.

Thill ranks No. 109 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 15.2%. See Amazon Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

China's finance ministry said on Sunday it was restricting government purchases of medical devices from the European Union that exceed 45 million yuan ($6.3 million) in value, in retaliation to Brussels' own curbs last month.

Tensions between Beijing and Brussels have been rising, with the European Union imposing tariffs on China-built electric vehicles and Beijing slapping duties on imported brandy from the bloc.

The European Union said last month it was barring Chinese companies from participating in EU public tenders for medical devices worth 60 billion euros ($70 billion) or more per year after concluding that EU firms were not given fair access in China.

The measure announced by the European Commission was the first under the EU's International Procurement Instrument, which entered into force in 2022 and is designed to ensure reciprocal market access.

China's countermeasures were expected after its commerce ministry flagged "necessary steps" against the EU move late last month.

"Regrettably, despite China's goodwill and sincerity, the EU has insisted on going its own way, taking restrictive measures and building new protectionist barriers," the commerce ministry said in a separate statement on Sunday.

"Therefore, China has no choice but to adopt reciprocal restrictive measures."

The EU delegation office in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

China will also restrict imports of medical devices from other countries that contain EU-made components worth more than 50% of the contract value, the finance ministry said. The measures come into force on Sunday.

The commerce ministry said products from European companies in China were not affected.

The world's second- and third-largest economies are due to hold a leaders' summit in China later in July.

On Friday, China also announced duties of up to 34.9% for five years on brandy originating in the European Union, most of it cognac from France, after concluding an investigation largely believed to be a response to Europe's EV tariffs.

Major cognac producers Pernod Ricard, LVMH and Remy Cointreau were spared from the levies, however, provided they sell at a minimum price, which China has not disclosed.

Trading volumes in altcoins such as Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) are surging as the current rally in cryptocurrencies accelerates.





Cardano's price has risen more than 6% over the past 24 hours as trading volumes spiked amidst a strengthening rally in digital assets. The price of Solana is currently at $152.45 per token, having gained as much as 5% in the past 24 hours. Cryptocurrencies trade 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Altcoins are broadly defined as any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin (BTC), which is the biggest digital currency by market capitalization. The current rally in altcoins comes with Bitcoin trading at $108,820 and on the cusp of an all-time high.

Market analysts remain divided on Cardano's short-term prospects and how long the altcoin rally will last. Some analysts point to bearish on-chain metrics, including declining active wallets. However, cryptocurrencies in general have been rallying alongside stocks in recent weeks, with the benchmark S&P 500 index now at a record high.

Having put concerns about trade wars and tariffs behind them, investors continue to pile into risk assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. Many on Wall Street expect to see new highs in Bitcoin and other crypto in coming weeks as the rally in U.S. markets gathers strength.

ADA is up nearly 50% over the last 12 months. 

Most Wall Street firms don't offer ratings or price targets on cryptocurrencies such as Cardano, so we'll look instead at its three-month performance. As one can see in the chart below, the price of ADA has declined 3.05% in the last 12 weeks.

Cardano has made headlines within crypto chatrooms after officially surpassing 111 million in total transactions on its blockchain network. This impressive milestone, alongside other notable ecosystem growth, underscores the network's growing user base and strong platform fundamentals. Even more, it reinforces the Layer-1 network's ability to offer utility-based solutions to everyday users in the decentralized space.

Achieving 111 million transactions signifies that Cardano is well-equipped to handle multiple transactions without dipping in performance. After all, the network has maintained a remarkable uptime spanning seven years. 

Adding to this recent milestone, the network continues to witness growing ecosystem engagements. Per recent data, the Cardano platform now supports 2,005 active projects, with delegated staking wallets up by 0.05% to 1.33 million. 

Here are other noteworthy ecosystem statistics to date:

The Cardano network also shows strong on-chain momentum amid growing bullish outlooks and increased adoption. In the past 67 days, the platform has recorded 276 billion ADA transactions, which at current market rates totals $165 billion. 

On top of that, holders have now staked over 22 billion ADA, representing about 62% of the circulating supply. This massive staking record signals the deep belief and strong confidence in the network's future performance. Meanwhile, Brave Browser, an open-source web browser currently supporting Cardano in beta and the imminent Midnight sidechain, has crossed 91 million monthly users. 

Given its strong performance and increased utility, it's no surprise that the Cardano community sentiment has hit a monthly high. At present, approximately 93.8% of users on CoinMarketCap are favoring the asset to be bullish.

At the time of writing, Cardano (ADA) is exchanging hands at $ 0.57 after trading relatively flat over the past intraday session. Recently, the asset has faced repeated rejection at the $0.60 price mark, a level closely monitored by market participants. Crypto commentator Ali Martinez explained that if ADA closes above $0.67, it could kickstart a northbound movement to between $0.83 and $0.91.

Based on the previous significant swing high and low calculations, the predicted price range aligns with the 0.5 and 0.382 Fibonacci retracement levels. These levels, which served as resistance zones early last year, could become key price targets if upside pressure mounts.

Prominent market personality Lucky Luciano is bullish on the asset, suggesting it is bound to hit “higher levels.” Assuming ADA reclaims its November 2023 peak, Lucky believes it could hit a long-term target of $1.32.

CoinCodex's price prediction model aligns with this long-range forecast. As per data, the coin is projected to trade between $1.18 and $1.31 by December 2027. ADA's price action is shaping up to resemble its epic 2020 rally, with market experts already drawing parallels with the current setup. And if the predicted ADA breakout above $0.80 holds, the token could initiate another leg higher.

Cardano is underway with a new development called Project Acropolis, which could change how developers interact with the network. With this new program, builders can create dApps directly within the Cardano node. At the moment, building apps on the Cardano network requires rigorous workarounds and technical maneuvers. 

Against this backdrop, Project Acropolis is designed to provide developers with a seamless and easy way to create apps on the network. Right now, the project is in its early days, having been launched in October 2024. Experts believe that if this product goes mainstream, Cardano will further cement its position as a top layer-1 network in the cryptosphere.

The debate about the longevity of Bitcoin has been ongoing for years. Most people would say that Bitcoin will end because of quantum technology, however, I believe there's another answer. 

Ever since Bitcoin debuted in 2009, people have speculated about the survival of this digital currency. Many people believed that it would go to zero, but 16 years later, governments are recognizing its potential as gold 2.0. 

Let's be real. Bitcoin has proven its reliability as an asset after reaching almost $112,000 per coin. The total market cap of cryptocurrencies hit an all-time high of $3.91 trillion, and most of this money was in Bitcoin. At the peak, BTC had a market cap of $2.227 trillion, while the remaining $1.68 trillion was in the 17,000-ish altcoins. 

Bitcoin is an asset class—other altcoins aren't included in this category. This is because BTC is among the top 10 assets ranked by market cap according to data from Infinite Market Cap.

Despite the massive success of Bitcoin, there's a technological phenomenon I believe that would kill the crypto king. 

Quantum computing is considered a major threat to Bitcoin. More specifically, quantum computers could break the complex mathematical algorithms that support modern cryptography. It could also make it possible to access dormant wallets and spend any Bitcoins from the Satoshi era. 

Quantum computing originates from two fields: quantum mechanics and computer science. 

Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics. It examines the physics of energy and matter at the atomic and subatomic levels. The behavior of atoms and subatomic particles is unique and classical physics laws like Newton's laws can't fully explain it. There are specific principles and phenomena that explain quantum mechanics such as superposition, quantization, etc.

Computer science is the study of computational systems and it includes algorithms, data structure, programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, etc. 

Quantum computing takes principles from quantum mechanics and applies them to computing for superior processing power.

But how could quantum computing crack the Bitcoin algorithm? Could it really make it possible to access dormant BTC coins?

Theoretically, if someone builds a powerful quantum computer and obtains your public key, they could derive your private key, forge a valid signature, and spend your BTC. 

This scenario depends on the type of wallet address used, whether the public key has been revealed, and the processing speed of the quantum computer.

All BTC in pay-to-public-key (p2pk) addresses and reused pay-to-public-key-hash (p2pkh) addresses are vulnerable to a quantum computer attack. In a p2pk address, the public key is exposed on the blockchain by default, even before any coins are spent. In a p2pkh address, the public key is not revealed until the coins are spent.

P2pk and p2pkh addresses were dominant in the early days of Bitcoin. The BTC mined by Satoshi Nakamoto are stored in p2pk addresses. 

In 2020, the number of Bitcoins in p2pk addresses was around 2 million coins, while p2pkh addresses had 2.5 million coins. A total of 4.5 million Bitcoins is equivalent to around $490 billion. 

In terms of processing speed, a quantum computer must derive the private key and broadcast a competing transaction before the next block is mined, typically within 10 minutes. 

So if a quantum computer takes two hours to derive a private key from a publicly available public key, it won't be able to spend the Bitcoins—because transactions are typically confirmed within 10 minutes. However, if the address is reused and receives new coins after the public key has already been revealed, those new funds become vulnerable, and the quantum computer could potentially spend them.

NEMP stands for nuclear electromagnetic pulse. It's considered both a technological phenomenon and a weapon. 

As the name indicates, an NEMP generates a pulse of electromagnetic radiation from a nuclear explosion, especially one detonated at high altitude. Instead of causing physical damage, an NEMP is intentionally detonated to generate an intense electromagnetic pulse. 

This results in an extremely high voltage and current surges into anything that conducts electricity — wires, antennas, power lines, computers, electronics etc. In other words, an NEMP will fry every electrical and electronic equipment and device. 

Because of the high altitude, an NEMP explosion can affect thousands of kilometers and impact an entire country or even continent. This means servers, data centers and Bitcoin mining farms are gone in a fraction of a second.

According to a YouGov poll, around 68 to 76% of Europeans and Americans believe that nuclear arms will be used in World War III. Analysts also point to growing tensions between major nuclear powers, including Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and the US. The recent Israel–Iran conflict, along with US-supported strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, is the closest the world has come to a nuclear war in recent years.  



If a global-scale NEMP attack happens, it could wipe out Bitcoin mining equipment, nodes, internet infrastructure and modern technology as we know it today. In 1949 Albert Einstein said “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.”


In such a scenario, one would not be wrong to assume that Bitcoin was not spared.

On July 6, Max Crown, CEO of the TON Foundation, announced on X a "groundbreaking initiative" offering toncoin TON$2.8896 holders the "exclusive chance" to secure a 10-year UAE Golden Visa. 

The program requires applicants to stake $100,000 worth of toncoin for three years and pay a one-time processing fee of $35,000. After the three-year lock-up period, staked funds can apparently be unlocked, and during this time, applicants reportedly earn an estimated 3–4% annual percentage yield (APY) on their staked tokens. 

The TON Foundation's website highlights several key alleged benefits: fast approval within seven weeks from document submission, a simple process without the need to purchase real estate or meet income thresholds, and inclusion of family members — spouse, children, and parents — at no extra cost beyond standard government fees. The staking is conducted through decentralized smart contracts on the TON blockchain, which it argues ensures transparency and security.

The program claims to offer a capital-efficient alternative to traditional UAE Golden Visa routes, which the TON Foundation says typically require a minimum investment of approximately $540,000 in real estate or fixed deposits, often tied to illiquid assets and longer processing times. The TON Golden Visa initiative is touted as a faster, more affordable, and digitally native pathway to UAE residency, aligning with the country's ambition to become a global crypto and Web3 hub.

The announcement had an immediate impact on toncoin's market performance. Shortly after the news broke, toncoin's price surged by 12%. At the time of writing, the token trades around $2.8944, reflecting a 5.36% increase over the past 24 hours. Additionally, the current 24-hour average trading volume is approximately 251.54% higher than the 30-day average, signaling heightened market interest and activity, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. 

Despite the enthusiasm, the announcement has generated controversy within the crypto community. Bobby Ong, co-founder and COO of CoinGecko, praised the partnership as an “amazing story” that could attract whales and provide strong buy support for toncoin, although he expressed hope that the initiative is not a temporary scheme. 

Conversely, "Joe HedgedHog" ("@JoeHedgedHog" on X), an investment partner at Sigil Fund, pointed out that this is not an official UAE government partnership but rather a third-party legal firm using TON as a proxy to assist clients applying for the Golden Visa under the entrepreneur category. He noted that the firm could have used any cryptocurrency and that the staking requirement serves more as a token utility sink than a government mandate.

Further skepticism came from "ivangbi" ("@ivangbi_" on X), the Head of Strategy & Business Development at Gearbox Protocol, who described the announcement as misleading. According to this perspective, the legal firm receives the non-refundable $35,000 fee and attempts to submit applications to the UAE government, which ultimately decides on approval. He argued that the staked TON balance is only one of several requirements and may no longer be relevant under updated rules. He went on to say that the absence of blanket approval for TON stakers means that acceptance is uncertain, and the program may primarily serve as a marketing tool coupled with token utility.

Changpeng Zhao (CZ), co-founder and former CEO of Binance, expressed cautious interest in the TON Foundation's UAE Golden Visa announcement but highlighted several uncertainties. He noted conflicting information about the program's legitimacy, including claims that the $35,000 fee mainly goes to a legal agent rather than the government, and that the website's language may misleadingly suggest a guaranteed visa upon staking $100,000 in toncoin. 

CZ also mentioned that theUAE regulators classify staking as a regulated activity for which TON may lack licenses. Importantly, he pointed out that official UAE government channels do not currently recognize staking toncoin as a visa qualification, listing the standard Golden Visa categories instead.

In a follow-up post, CZ reiterated his cautious optimism, emphasizing the need to “trust but verify.” He acknowledged the potential benefits of such a program but stressed that official government partnerships and announcements are essential for legitimacy—none of which have yet been confirmed. His stance balances support for innovation and TON founder Pavel Durov with prudent skepticism about the program's current status.

The UAE entrepreneur visa category, which this program appears to target, is designed for individuals owning economic projects of a technical or innovative nature. Applicants must provide approval letters from an accredited UAE auditor confirming the project's value (at least 500,000 AED), local authorities verifying the project's innovative character, and an accredited UAE business incubator to establish the proposed activity in the country.

Major cryptocurrencies rose Sunday morning as the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at upcoming trade deals before the July 9 Liberation Day tariff deadline.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, gained over 1%, briefly topping $109,000. Payments-focused XRP and Solana's SOL token gained over 2% each, with meme token dogecoin DOGE$0.1707 rising 3%, according to data source CoinDesk. Ethereum's ether, the second-largest token, rose 1.5% to $2,550.

In an interview with CNN, Bessent stated that the U.S. is close to finalizing several trade deals ahead of the July 9 deadline, when the temporary pause in higher tariffs initially announced on April 2 is set to expire.

"President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly," Bessent said, per Reuters.

Bessent explained that July 9 remains the deadline for negotiations, failing which higher tariffs, announced in early April, will take effect from Aug. 1.

"We are saying this is when it's happening. If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that's your choice," Bessent told CNN, adding that some countries were 'foot-dragging' on getting to deals.

Since taking office early this year, President Donald Trump has been focused on making the U.S. wealthy again by imposing tariffs on goods imported from other countries, a coercive tactic aimed at rebalancing trade relations and reducing the U.S. trade deficit.

Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, starting with a 10% base tax on all trading partners and additional amounts on many countries, with some ranging as high as 50%. The so-called Liberation Day announcement triggered a sell-off in financial markets, with U.S. stocks taking a significant hit alongside a sharp decline in bitcoin, which fell to $75,000.

The panic likely prompted the Trump administration to announce a 90-day pause a week later.

Since then, the so-called U.S. exceptionalism has resurfaced in financial markets, lifting major U.S. equity indices to record highs. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have outperformed their global peers, with BTC rallying to trade above $100,000.

A Reddit post struck a nerve in the crypto community, sparking heated debate over one of investing's most painful questions: When do you take profits?

The post's central thesis is brutally simple: Despite what keyboard warriors claim today, virtually everyone who bought Bitcoin in its early days would have sold long before it reached current prices. And according to the poster—and basic investment principles—they would have been right to do so.

The Reddit discussion reveals a fundamental tension between investment theory and human psychology. As one commenter noted, “If you 500x an investment yeah you sold lol.”

The math is compelling: If you bought Bitcoin at $1 and watched it climb to $100, you'd have made a 10,000% return. Taking profits at that point wasn't paper hands—it was prudent risk management. The fact that Bitcoin later reached $60,000+ doesn't retroactively make selling at $100 a mistake.

“Nothing is guaranteed in investing,” the original poster emphasized. “Anyone who saw their investment multiply by 1000x and didn't cash out was essentially gambling.”

One of the most insightful comments came from a user who highlighted how net worth influences selling decisions. A college student watching $500 turn into $10,000 faces a completely different calculus than a wealthy investor seeing the same percentage gain on a larger portfolio.

For the student, that $10,000 could mean a reliable car, reduced student debt, or a house down payment. For someone with substantial assets, letting it ride might make more sense as “play money.”

This observation cuts to the heart of position sizing and risk management—concepts that crypto's “diamond hands” culture often overlooks.

Not everyone agreed with the “everyone would have sold” narrative. Several commenters claimed to have held through massive gains, with one user reporting 300x returns while vowing to “never sell Bitcoin even at x3000.”

These holders share a common belief: Bitcoin represents a fundamental shift away from traditional currency, making it a “once in a lifetime” investment opportunity. As one put it, “Bitcoin's price is only expected to rise and fiat is only expected to plummet.”

But even among the diamond hands crowd, practical challenges emerged. One commenter admitted, “I've been holding BTC because I don't know where to sell it,” highlighting the gap between investment philosophy and execution.

The discussion wasn't without cautionary tales. One user shared how they lost 80% of their crypto holdings when the Voyager exchange collapsed, watching their “6 figure net worth reduced to 4 figure inside a week.”

This story underscores a critical point often lost in crypto success stories: unrealized gains aren't real until they're realized. The most perfect diamond hands strategy fails if you can't access your assets when you need them.

Some users proposed middle-ground strategies. One suggested time-locking Bitcoin to enforce long-term holding while still allowing eventual profit-taking—releasing a set amount each year over a decade, for instance.

This approach acknowledges both the potential for long-term growth and the human need to realize gains. It's a recognition that perfect market timing is impossible, but systematic profit-taking can work.

The Reddit thread's most valuable insight isn't about crypto specifically—it's about the nature of investing decisions. As one commenter noted, “Hindsight is a b*tch.”

Every investment decision must be made with incomplete information and uncertain outcomes. The person who sold Bitcoin at $100 made a rational decision based on the information available at the time. The fact that it continued rising doesn't invalidate that logic.

Start with position sizing: Never invest more than you can afford to lose completely. This makes holding through volatility psychologically easier.

Consider your circumstances: Your age, net worth, and financial obligations should influence your profit-taking strategy. What works for a 25-year-old may not work for a 45-year-old with a mortgage and kids.

Plan your exits: Before making any investment, decide at what point you'll take profits. Having a plan removes emotion from the decision.

Don't let perfect be the enemy of good: Taking some profits after significant gains isn't “paper hands”—it's risk management.

Remember the risks: Unrealized gains can disappear quickly. Exchange failures, regulatory changes, and market crashes are all real possibilities.

The Reddit discussion reveals an uncomfortable truth: Most successful long-term crypto holders succeeded despite their strategy, not because of it. The difference between conviction and stubbornness is often just luck.

For retail investors, the lesson isn't to abandon long-term thinking—it's to balance conviction with prudence. Take some profits along the way. You might miss some upside, but you'll sleep better at night.

And if you're beating yourself up for selling an investment “too early,” remember: You made a rational decision with the information you had. That's not failure—that's investing.

The Bitcoin blockchain lacks meaningful on-chain activity, even as its native token, bitcoin BTC$108,883.22, trades near a record per-unit price. That's according to mempool – a holding area for unconfirmed blockchain transactions waiting to be included in a block by miners.

On Satuday, the mempool had just 5,000 odd transactions awaiting inclusion, with the tally rising to 15,000 at press time, still a far cry from 150,000 when BTC's price first rose above $100,000 in late 2024, according to data source Blockchain.com.

Since March this year, the tally has oscillated between $3,000 and $30,000, indicating anaemic demand for the network despite BTC establishing a foothold above $100,000.

"Bitcoin's mempool (queue of transactions waiting to be processed) is almost completely empty. The percentage of miner revenue coming from fees (instead of inflation) is down to a fraction of a percent," Joël Valenzuela, director of marketing and business development, said on X.

"Simply put, almost all of Bitcoin's actual users have gone away. At all-time price highs, too!" Valenzuela added, calling the situation a major crisis where the network goes bankrupt or becomes "completely custodial asset run by governments and institutions."

According to Joao Wedson, CEO and founder of crypto data analysis platform Alphractal, the idle mempool is a sign of missing retail participation in the market.

"When Mempool transactions begin to rise again, it's a clear sign that retail is back — because the growing backlog reflects increased demand for using the network," Wedson said.

Milestone deal to simplify real estate investing through tokenisation, digital currencies

Dubai: The Dubai Land Department has signed a partnership with Crypto.com to develop a blockchain-powered investment environment for virtual real estate — a move that could reshape how people buy, sell, and invest in property.

The agreement, signed on July 6, 2025, supports Dubai's Real Estate Strategy 2033 and its Dh1 trillion transaction target by aiming to create a secure, fully digital system for tokenised property assets.

Under the deal, the Dubai Land Department and Crypto.com will explore ways to let people trade real estate using digital currencies and blockchain technology. This includes investor verification, digital custody, settlements, and the tokenisation of real estate assets — all designed to boost transparency, liquidity, and ease of access for investors.

"This marks a major step toward building a smart, integrated digital property ecosystem in Dubai," said officials at the signing event. The initiative aligns with the government's recent announcement allowing the use of digital currencies for government fee payments — another signal of Dubai's commitment to embracing future-ready technologies.

Crypto.com will provide the tech solutions and advisory support, while the Dubai Land Department will ensure regulatory compliance and help implement pilot projects under its existing legal framework.

The partnership positions Dubai at the forefront of digital real estate innovation, potentially opening the market to global investors looking for smarter, tech-driven opportunities in one of the world's fastest-growing cities.

 Bitcoin and Solana are in for astronomical upside if they both complete a cup and handle breakout pattern, monthly chart analysis concludes. 

Key points:

Bitcoin and Solana can reach parabolic new highs if both crypto tokens successfully complete a cup and handle pattern, according to analysis.

BTC price and SOL price targets are $230,000 and $4,390, respectively.

SOL/USD would need to deliver gains of nearly 3,000% to hit the breakout top level.

Bitcoin (BTC) can reach $230,000 if a classic breakout move completes successfully, a new prediction states.

In his latest analysis, the popular X content creator, Trader Alan, delivered a giant $4,390 Solana (SOL) price target.

Bitcoin has spent seven weeks acting within a narrow range, but as time goes on, anticipation is growing as to where BTC price action will head next.

For Trader Alan, a familiar chart pattern holds the key — and so far, progress is exactly what bulls are hoping for.

“Bitcoin and Solana Cup and Handle Pattern on monthly chart,” he told X followers, adding that SOL/USD is currently attempting to copy BTC.

A cup-and-handle pattern is a well-known bullish setup in which price returns to a previous high, consolidates and then continues higher, often with explosive results.

As Cointelegraph reported, BTC/USD has already completed a long-term cup and handle, from its 2021 peak to 2022 low and back up, followed by its first trip to the $100,000 mark.

“$BTC has broken out the handle while $SOL is still waiting for the breakout,” Alan claims about the latest iterations of the pattern, which in Bitcoin's case extends the breakout beyond the 2021 high.

While the BTC/USD target still represents 115% gains, it is comparatively modest when viewed next to Solana's roadmap, which calls for upside of nearly 3,000%.

SOL/USD currently trades at around $150, while the pair's all-time high from January 2025 is $294, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.

In the absence of “altseason,” however, such a parabolic move faces significant hurdles. Bitcoin's dominance of the overall crypto market cap continues to grow, passing 65% to reach its highest levels since early 2021.

However, as Cointelegraph noted, BTC dominance hitting 70% has historically coincided with the start of altcoin strength.

Earlier, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital added that this cycle may not need a tag of the 70% zone for altseason to begin.

"Wall Street is coming for bitcoin."

That phrase used to spark both hope and fear across crypto circles. Today, it's no longer a future threat or a bullish promise—it's just reality. 

The original premise of bitcoin (or crypto in general)—an asset that is censorship-resistant and doesn't answer to any traditional financial institution or government—is fading fast as Wall Street giants (as well as powerful political figures) continue to establish their strong foothold in the digital assets space. 

During the early years of the digital assets revolution, bitcoin was celebrated as uncorrelated and unapologetically anti-establishment. TradFi asset classes like S&P 500 would rise and fall—bitcoin didn't care. 

What bitcoin did care about were the flaws in the traditional financial system, which are still here to this day. 

A major example in BTC's history that's not-so-talked about anymore is the 2013 Cyprus banking crisis.

The crisis, which occurred due to overexposure of banks to overleveraged local property companies and amid Europe's debt crisis, saw deposits above 100,000 euros get a substantial haircut.

In fact, 47.5% of uninsured deposits were seized. Bitcoin's response was to move sharply upward to, for the first time in its history, cross the $1,000 threshold.

After a prolonged bear market over the collapse of Mt. Gox, the idea of mass adoption grew, with Wall Street's entry into the sector seen as a stamp of validation for bitcoin as it meant more liquidity, mass adoption and price maturity.  

That changed everything. 

The price might have matured, as evidenced by waning volatility. But let's face it—bitcoin is now just another macro-driven risk asset.

"Bitcoin, once celebrated for its low correlation to mainstream financial assets, has increasingly exhibited sensitivity to the same variables that drive equity markets over short time frames," said NYDIC Research in a report. 

In fact, the correlation is now hovering near the higher end of the historical range, according to NYDIG's calculations. "Bitcoin's correlation with U.S. equities remained elevated through the end of the quarter, closing at 0.48, a level near the higher end of its historical range."

Simply put, when there is blood on the street (Wall Street that is), bitcoin bleeds too. When Wall Street sneezes, bitcoin catches a cold.

Even bitcoin's “digital gold” moniker is under pressure. 

NYDIG notes that bitcoin's correlation to physical gold and the U.S. dollar is near zero. So much for the “hedge” argument—at least for now.

So why the shift? 

The answer is simple: to Wall Street, bitcoin is just another risk asset, not digital gold, which is synonymous with "safe haven."

Investors are repricing everything from central bank policy whiplash to geopolitical tension—digital assets included.

"This persistent correlation strength with U.S. equities can largely be attributed to a series of macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, the tariff turmoil and the rising number of global conflicts, which significantly influenced investor sentiment and asset repricing across markets," said NYDIG.

And like it or not, this is here to stay—at least for a short to medium-term. 

As long as central bank policy, macro, and war-linked red headlines hit the tape, bitcoin will likely move in tandem with equities.  

"The current correlation regime may persist as long as global risk sentiment, central bank policy, and geopolitical flashpoints remain dominant market narratives," NYDIG's report said. 

For the maxis and long-term holders, the original vision hasn't changed. Bitcoin's limited supply, borderless access, and decentralized nature remain untouched. Just don't expect them to impact price action just yet. 

For now, the market sees bitcoin as just another stock ticker. Just balance your trade strategies accordingly.

Oops, something went wrong

A simple question posted on Reddit recently sparked one of the most revealing debates about Bitcoin's future: “If only 5% of the population owns BTC, what is the use case?” The post, which garnered hundreds of responses, exposed a fundamental tension that's been brewing in the crypto space for years.

The original poster laid out the problem starkly: “So, if 19 million bitcoin are presently ‘minted' and only 4% of the population are holders... What good is a ‘currency' that only 5% of the population owns???”

It's a fair question that cuts to the heart of Bitcoin's identity crisis—and the answer reveals why Bitcoin might be succeeding precisely because it's failing as a traditional currency.

The debate immediately split into two camps, each with a fundamentally different vision of what Bitcoin should be.

The “Electronic Cash” Purists point to Satoshi Nakamoto's original white paper, titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” As one commenter put it: “Bitcoin is explicitly designed to function as peer-to-peer electronic cash. That's literally the title.”

The “Digital Gold” Advocates argue that Bitcoin has evolved beyond its original purpose. “Bitcoin is NOT a currency,” wrote one user. “It is not designed to be used as a payment vehicle... It is designed to be a safe harbor for your money while your government ruins your fiat.”

This isn't just an academic debate—it reveals a profound shift in how Bitcoin is being positioned and used in the real world.

The most compelling counterargument to the “5% problem” comes from an unexpected source: precious metals.

“What percentage of the population owns gold?” multiple commenters asked. The comparison is illuminating. Gold isn't widely used for daily transactions, yet it maintains value as a store of wealth. Similarly, Bitcoin supporters argue that widespread ownership isn't necessary for utility.

“I don't own gold so that I can take it to Walmart to buy a TV,” one user explained. “I own gold because its supply cannot be inflated like fiat currency, therefore its value will increase.”

But critics push back on this analogy. Gold has industrial uses, cultural significance, and thousands of years of history. Bitcoin has... math.

Perhaps the most telling response to the adoption question was the collective refrain: “We're early.”

This phrase, repeated throughout the thread, represents more than just optimism—it's a fundamental belief that Bitcoin adoption follows a different trajectory than traditional currencies or payment systems.

“Adoption isn't linear, it's exponential!” one commenter declared. “We're still early. And early always looks confusing. Until it's obvious.”

The “early” narrative draws parallels to the internet's adoption curve, credit card acceptance, or even gold's historical role. Supporters argue that Bitcoin's current 5% ownership rate is actually impressive for a 15-year-old technology challenging millennia-old monetary systems.

The most damning criticism in the thread came from users who see Bitcoin as pure speculation.

“Bitcoin, like all cryptocurrencies, is best understood as a collectible asset,” wrote one skeptic. “Its value is not tied to any underlying cash flows... What gives it value is belief and shared conviction that it's scarce, desirable, and that someone else in the future will likely pay more for it.”

This perspective frames Bitcoin not as a currency or even a store of value, but as a digital collectible whose worth depends entirely on the greater fool theory—the hope that someone else will pay more for it later.

Even some Bitcoin supporters acknowledged this tension. “I still have yet to meet or see someone pay with bitcoin. It's always from an investment perspective,” one user admitted.

The discussion revealed an uncomfortable truth: Bitcoin's current infrastructure doesn't support widespread adoption as a currency. At roughly 3 transactions per second, the network would allow each person on Earth to make one Bitcoin transaction every 3.5 years.

“In its current state, everyday purchases with bitcoin is akin to going to a secure bank vault just to withdraw 5 dollars for a coffee,” one user noted.

Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network are supposed to address these scaling issues, but they remain largely theoretical for most users.

The Reddit debate reveals three key insights for anyone considering Bitcoin:

1. Bitcoin's Value Proposition Is Evolving Whether you see this as a natural evolution or a betrayal of Bitcoin's original vision depends on your perspective. But the market has clearly spoken: Bitcoin's store-of-value narrative has driven more adoption than its payment utility.

2. The 5% Problem Might Be the Point If Bitcoin succeeds as “digital gold,” it doesn't need universal adoption. Gold's monetary role historically came from scarcity, not ubiquity. The same logic could apply to Bitcoin.

3. The Speculation vs. Utility Debate Isn't Settled Bitcoin's future depends on whether it can develop genuine utility beyond speculation. The next few years will determine whether Bitcoin becomes a lasting store of value or just an expensive lesson in collective delusion.

The “5% problem” isn't actually a problem—it's a feature. Bitcoin's limited adoption might be exactly what gives it value in a world of infinite money printing.

But that doesn't mean Bitcoin is risk-free. As one commenter noted: “Its value is 95% speculation so 5% seems about right.”

For investors, the question isn't whether Bitcoin will achieve universal adoption as a currency. The question is whether 5% of the population believing in Bitcoin's scarcity narrative is enough to sustain and grow its value over time.

The Reddit debate suggests that for now, the answer is yes. Whether that remains true as central banks develop digital currencies and traditional financial systems adapt remains to be seen.

While MicroStrategy popularized bitcoin as a store of value, SharpLink Gaming is revolutionizing the approach with Ethereum. The company holds 500 million dollars in ETH, which it presents as the “foundational layer of global finance.” A strategy that goes beyond a simple store of value.

On July 4, 2025, SharpLink Gaming marked a historic turning point. This Nasdaq-listed company, specializing in marketing for online sports betting, became the first public company to adopt Ethereum (ETH) as its primary treasury reserve asset.

This decision is based on a 425 million dollar private placement conducted at the end of May by Consensys, a giant in the Ethereum ecosystem. To seal this strategic commitment, Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Consensys, joined SharpLink's board as chairman.

SharpLink's ETH accumulation took place in several stages. Between late May and mid-June, the company acquired 176,271 ETH for a total of 463 million dollars, at an average price of 2,626 dollars per unit.

A few days later, it added an additional 12,207 ETH for 30.7 million dollars, partly financed by “At-The-Market” (ATM) stock sales.

As of July 1, the total treasury reached 198,478 ETH. Even more impressive: 100% of these assets are deployed in staking solutions, already generating more than 540,000 dollars in rewards since the launch of the strategy.

For SharpLink, Ethereum is not just an investment asset. The company considers it “the foundational layer of global finance,” an infrastructure capable of deeply transforming capital management.

Its conviction rests on three essential pillars:

Rob Phythian, CEO of SharpLink, perfectly summarizes this vision:

Ethereum is much more than a treasury asset. It is, in our view, the foundation of the next generation of financial infrastructures.

This strategy clearly differs from that of players like Strategy, whose approach is based on bitcoin as a pure store of value. Ethereum, on the other hand, offers a productive, programmable asset integrated into a rapidly expanding digital economy.

On the market side, ETH shows stability around 2,505 $, with a modest 0.56% increase in 24 hours. While the immediate impact remains limited, this technical resilience reflects growing institutional interest.

By betting heavily on ETH, SharpLink is not trying to follow a trend but to build a new standard. A standard where decentralized finance (DeFi) becomes a lasting part of the balance sheets of publicly traded companies.

Nexus is billing itself as “the world supercomputer.” The L1's ambitions are on full display as it churns through its final testnet ahead of mainnet launch, slated for later this year.

Anyone can join the network in a few clicks from any device, contributing compute power to help build what Nexus calls “a verifiable world.”

What is a “world supercomputer,” you might ask? It's a novel approach, according to CEO and founder Daniel Marin:

“The goal there is to build the largest distributed computer system ever, and part of the reason we're doing that is because we're trying to aggregate computing power to build a blockchain with a new architecture,” Marin told Blockworks.

Nexus combines familiar ideas from other cutting-edge chains but integrates them into a single, opinionated layer-1.

Like Mina Protocol, Nexus aims to condense all blockchain states into a single succinct proof — but while Mina uses recursive SNARKs for constant-size proofs, Nexus relies on its RISC-V-based zkVM to handle vastly more complex workloads, including AI inference. Its choice of a RISC-V zkVM is reminiscent of RISC Zero, enabling general-purpose Rust code to be proven verifiably, but Nexus makes this VM a native part of its chain, not just a service layer. Ethereum itself may eventually go in this direction.

For data availability, Nexus' planned sampling approach echoes Celestia's modular DA model, while its consensus will evolve from the current and commonly used CometBFT (formerly Tendermint) toward HotStuff-2, making it similar to Aptos or Sui. These consensus protocols provide fast finality — in Nexus' case, coordinating globally distributed proving tasks.

Nexus then bakes in a decentralized compute cloud directly into its L1, turning every connected device into part of a single, verifiable computer built around an Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC) machine. The VM generates succinct proofs for every computation step, integrates those proofs via DAG-style propagation, and aggregates them into a single Universal Proof. Nexus uses the Stwo (Circle STARK) prover.

That's a lot of buzzwords, but the TL;DR is this architecture theoretically enables horizontal scalability — each added node increases network throughput.

On the cryptography front, Nexus touts the involvement of heavyweight figures like Jens Groth and Michel Abdalla, fortifying its credentials in zero‑knowledge and blockchain research.

And it's not all theory. Last week, Nexus activated its third and final testnet, and its mainnet is targeted for Q3.

Nexus claims over 2.1 million unique users across its various testnets, backed up by Sybil detection. About 4,000 accounts are active today, Nexus' block explorer shows.

For Marin, Nexus exists to break out of blockchains' limitations “because it's impossible to build any meaningful application today.”

Marin said: “Our hypothesis from the very start of the company is that coding on a blockchain or coding on a zkVM should feel indistinguishable from coding on your own computer.” 

The protocol is optimizing for speed, not decentralization.

“We want to be decentralized in the long term, [but] we don't want to be decentralized right now at all, and in fact, pretty much the opposite,” Marin continued. “So it's a little bit of a philosophical take that will piss off some people.”

In the near term, the Nexus team is targeting quarterly releases, gunning for the trendy objective of being infrastructure for the AI era.

“We want users to feel like, ‘Wow, we're building the future. We're part of a community and a network, I can see other apps in the ecosystem, I can do quests and have fun,'” Marin said.

 Secret Service quietly amasses one of the world's largest crypto cold wallets with $400 million seized, exposing scams through blockchain sleuthing and VPN missteps. 

The US Secret Service has quietly seized nearly $400 million in digital assets over the past decade, amassing one of the world's largest crypto cold wallets, Bloomberg reported Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The agency's Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) has tracked funds through open-source tools, blockchain analysis, and patience, Jamie Lam, an investigative analyst with the US Secret Service, reportedly told law enforcement officials in Bermuda last month.

The agency's crypto trove, much of which sits in a single cold-storage wallet, results from a string of investigations into scams. Scammers lure targets into seemingly legitimate crypto investment platforms in one typical scheme. Victims often see initial profits before the sites vanish with their deposits.

“That's how they do it,” Lam said. “They'll send you a photo of a really good-looking guy or girl. But it's probably some old guy in Russia.”

Lam's team uses domain records, blockchain transactions, and VPN slip-ups to identify fraudsters. In one case, a cryptocurrency payment led investigators to another wallet. In another one, a brief VPN failure exposed an IP address, helping agents piece together the scam's digital trail.

At the helm of the Secret Service's crypto strategy is Kali Smith, who directs a team that has trained officials in over 60 countries to unmask online financial crimes.

The agency has focused on jurisdictions with weak oversight or programs selling residency to foreign nationals. “Sometimes after just a week-long training, they can be like, ‘Wow, we didn't even realize that this is occurring in our country,'” Smith said.

The Secret Service's work has uncovered scams ranging from romance-investment schemes to sextortion cases. One investigation involved an Idaho teenager who sent a nude photo to an online stranger. The scammer extorted $300 twice before the teen went to the police.

Analysts traced the payments through another coerced teenager acting as a money mule, leading to an account tied to nearly $4.1 million in transactions under a Nigerian passport. British police arrested the suspected extortionist when he arrived in Guildford, England, where he remains in custody pending extradition.

Crypto-related scams have become the top driver of US internet crime losses. Americans reported $9.3 billion stolen in crypto fraud in 2024, more than half of the $16.6 billion in total internet crime losses that year, FBI data show.

Meanwhile, the first half of 2025 has seen more than $2.47 billion in losses due to hacks, scams and exploits, representing a nearly 3% increase compared to the $2.4 billion stolen in 2024.

Recovering stolen crypto often depends on cooperation from industry players. Coinbase and Tether have acknowledged assisting in high-profile cases by analyzing transactions and freezing wallets. One of the largest single recoveries involved $225 million in USDt (USDT) linked to romance scams.

Wall Street firms are increasingly investing in blockchain technology through Digital Asset, a leading institutional blockchain platform. This trend is evident in the recent investment by YZi Labs, a venture capital firm founded by former Binance CEO Changpeng (CZ) Zhao, which has invested in Digital Asset. This investment is part of a $135 million Series E funding round that includes participation from major financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs and Citadel Securities. The funding round underscores the growing interest of traditional financial firms in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize the financial industry.

The investment by YZi Labs in Digital Asset is significant as it highlights the convergence of Wall Street and blockchain technology. Digital Asset's Canton Network, a blockchain platform designed for institutional use, is at the forefront of this convergence. The platform aims to provide a secure and efficient infrastructure for financial institutions to leverage blockchain technology, enabling them to tokenize assets and streamline their operations.

The tokenization of assets is seen as a key application of blockchain technology in the financial industry. Tokenization involves using digital assets on a blockchain to represent ownership of physical property or other digital assets. This process can enhance transparency, security, and efficiency in financial transactions. By investing in Digital Asset, Wall Street firms are positioning themselves to capitalize on the benefits of tokenization and stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving financial landscape.

The investment by Wall Street firms in Digital Asset also reflects a broader trend of traditional financial institutions embracing blockchain technology. This trend is driven by the recognition that blockchain can offer significant advantages in terms of security, transparency, and efficiency. By investing in Digital Asset, these firms are not only supporting the development of blockchain technology but also ensuring that they have a stake in its future growth and success.

Changpeng Zhao has pivoted from Binance to lead YZi Labs, focusing on Web3 investments. Digital Asset, backed by firms like Goldman Sachs and Citadel, raised $135 million for the Canton Network, progressing blockchain adoption further. The integration of blockchain could enhance financial transaction transparency and efficiency. Firms may benefit from reduced costs and improved compliance through innovative asset tokenization methods.

Historical precedents, like JPMorgan's blockchain ventures, show regulated assets can indeed transition to blockchain, though challenges remain. The Canton Network may set the tone for future blockchain finance collaborations. Insights suggest continued cross-industry collaborations may drive blockchain to mainstream financial operations, fostering innovation in asset management and improving regulatory mechanisms.

The investment by YZi Labs and other Wall Street firms in Digital Asset is a clear indication of the growing interest in blockchain technology among traditional financial institutions. This trend is likely to continue as more firms recognize the potential of blockchain to transform the financial industry. The investment in Digital Asset by YZi Labs and other major financial institutions is a significant step towards the integration of blockchain technology into the mainstream financial system.

Dementia poses a major health challenge with no safe, affordable treatments to slow its progression.

Researchers at Lawson Research Institute (Lawson), the research arm of St. Joseph's Health Care London, are investigating whether Ambroxol -- a cough medicine used safely for decades in Europe -- can slow dementia in people with Parkinson's disease.

Published on June 30 in the prestigious JAMA Neurology, this 12-month clinical trial involving 55 participants with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) monitored memory, psychiatric symptoms and GFAP, a blood marker linked to brain damage. Parkinson's disease dementia causes memory loss, confusion, hallucinations and mood changes. About half of those diagnosed with Parkinson's develop dementia within 10 years, profoundly affecting patients, families and the health care system.

Led by Cognitive Neurologist Dr. Stephen Pasternak, the study gave one group daily Ambroxol while the other group received a placebo. "Our goal was to change the course of Parkinson's dementia," says Pasternak. "This early trial offers hope and provides a strong foundation for larger studies."

Key findings from the clinical trial include:

Although Ambroxol is approved in Europe for treating respiratory conditions and has a long-standing safety record -- including use at high doses and during pregnancy -- it is not approved for any use in Canada or the U.S.

"Current therapies for Parkinson's disease and dementia address symptoms but do not stop the underlying disease," explains Pasternak. "These findings suggest Ambroxol may protect brain function, especially in those genetically at risk. It offers a promising new treatment avenue where few currently exist."

Ambroxol supports a key enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which is produced by the GBA1 gene. In people with Parkinson's disease, GCase levels are often low. When this enzyme doesn't work properly, waste builds up in brain cells, leading to damage. Pasternak learned about Ambroxol during a fellowship at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto, where it was identified as a treatment for Gaucher disease -- a rare genetic disorder in children caused by a deficiency of GCase.

He is now applying that research to explore whether boosting GCase with Ambroxol could help protect the brain in Parkinson's-related diseases. "This research is vital because Parkinson's dementia profoundly affects patients and families," says Pasternak. "If a drug like Ambroxol can help, it could offer real hope and improve lives."

Funded by the Weston Foundation, this study is an important step toward developing new treatments for Parkinson's disease and other cognitive disorders, including dementia with Lewy bodies. Pasternak and his team plan to start a follow-up clinical trial focused specifically on cognition later this year.

In Japan, Shinrin Yoku or forest bathing has already been used for therapeutic applications, for instance, to lower blood pressure and stress levels. For their study, the researchers wanted to find out whether forest bathing - consciously immersing oneself in nature - can also be effective when done virtually, and focused on whether the positive effect is stronger when several senses are addressed simultaneously.

For the project, a high-quality 360° VR video was produced in Europe's largest Douglas fir forest, the Sonnenberg nature reserve near Parchim - complete with original sounds and the scent of essential oils from the Douglas fir. The participants experienced the virtual forest scenery either as a full sensory experience (with images, sound and scent) or in a reduced form whereby forest stimuli appealing to just a single sense - visual, auditory or olfactory - were used. In variants where only hearing or scent was activated, participants were placed in a neutral virtual environment to minimize visual stimuli and the influence of VR technology.

Significantly better effect with sensory combination 

More than 130 participants were first put into an acute stress situation using stress-inducing images. Then, equipped with VR glasses, they experienced one of the four forest stimulation/ bathing variants. The results show that the combination of all three sensory stimuli led to a significantly greater improvement in mood and a stronger feeling of connection with nature compared to when individual sensory stimuli were presented. In addition to positive effects on mood, there were also limited improvements in working memory - the cognitive function that enables us to store, process and retrieve information in the short term.

However, the researchers point out that the effects are area-specific and cannot yet be considered universally valid. Further studies with larger samples are needed to confirm the results and provide a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the restorative effects of virtual nature experiences.

"We can already say that digital nature experiences can absolutely produce an emotional effect - even if they don't replace actual nature," reports Leonie Ascone, lead author of the study and researcher in the Neuronal Plasticity working group at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).

Potential for clinics, waiting rooms and urban spaces 

Simone Kühn, head of the study and Director of the Center for Environmental Neuroscience at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, adds: "Especially in places with limited access to nature - such as clinics, waiting areas or urban interiors - multisensory VR applications or targeted nature staging could support mental well-being. The images, sounds and scents of nature offer previously underestimated potential for improving mood and mental performance in everyday situations." Kühn conducts intensive research into the effects of the environment on the human brain and, together with colleagues from universities in Vienna, Exeter and Birmingham, was recently able to prove that just from watching nature videos, patients perceive physical pain as less intense (Steininger et al., 2025).

This Block-Stacking Math Problem Has a Preposterous Solution You Need to See to Believe

In principle, this impossible math allows for a glue-free bridge of stacked blocks that can stretch across the Grand Canyon—and into infinity

By Jack Murtagh edited by Jeanna Bryner

Amanda Montañez

Here's a mind-blowing experiment that you can try at home: Gather some children's blocks and place them on a table. Take one block and slowly push it over the table's edge, inch by inch, until it's on the brink of falling. If you possess patience and a steady hand, you should be able to balance it so that exactly half of it hangs off the edge. Nudge it any farther, and gravity wins. Now take two blocks and start over. Stacking one on top of the other, how far can you get the end of the top block to poke over the table's edge?

Amanda Montañez

Keep going. Stacking as many blocks as you can, what is the farthest overhang you can achieve before the whole structure topples? Is it possible for the tower to extend a full block length beyond the lip of the table? Does physics permit two block lengths? The stunning answer is that the stacked bridge can stretch forever. In principle, a freestanding stack of blocks can span the Grand Canyon, no glue required.

Don't click “checkout” on an infinite pack of Jenga blocks just yet. Real-world practicalities such as irregular block shapes, air currents and the crushing weight of an endless edifice may hamper your engineering aspirations. Still, understanding why the overhang has no limit in an ideal mathematical world is enlightening. The explanation hinges on math's harmonic series and the physics concept of center of mass, two seemingly simple ideas with outsize power. [For more fun, check out: How Tall Can You Build a Tower without It Toppling?]

Your intuition might tell you that a single block can hang half of its mass beyond the table's edge before tipping. But why is that so? Every object has a center of mass—a single point at which we can imagine the entire object's weight to be concentrated when we're thinking about balance. As long as the center of mass sits above the table, the object stays put. The moment that center of mass passes over an edge, however, gravity will pull the whole thing over. In the case of a spoon, an item with irregular weight distribution, we can hang more than half of the utensil's handle over an edge before it tips because the center of mass lies closer to its head, where more of the weight resides. For our stacked bridge, we assume that our blocks are all identical, with a uniform density (that is, they're not denser in some parts than others), so each one's center of mass sits at the middle point.

When we add more blocks, we must account for the center of mass of the entire tower. Consider the case of two blocks. We know the top block can extend half of its mass beyond the one below it. But after doing that, how far can we push out the bottom block?

Amanda Montañez

For simplicity, let's say each block has a length of 1 and a mass of 1. You'll find the bottom block can poke out only a quarter of the way (compared with having half its length over the edge when it was alone). At that point, the center of mass of the top block and the center of mass of the bottom block are equidistant from the edge of the table (the top block's center of mass sits one quarter to the right of the edge, and the bottom block's center of mass sits one quarter to the left of the edge). So the combined center of mass of the two-block system rests perfectly balanced above the edge of the table.

A pattern emerges as we continue to add blocks to the structure. The top block extends 1⁄2 beyond the one below it, the second block extends 1⁄4 beyond the block below it, the third extends 1⁄6, the fourth extends 1⁄8, then subsequent blocks extend 1⁄10, 1⁄12, and so on. To see why, let's look at another example. Suppose we have a stable tower that contains five blocks, and we want to add a sixth block below it and then slide the whole structure out as far as we can. It's helpful to conceptualize this picture as only two blocks: one with a mass of 5 atop a single block with a mass of 1. We'll first scoot the heavy block as far as it will go so that its center of mass sits right above the bottom block's edge. We can then push the bottom block exactly 1⁄12 of a unit beyond the table's edge. How do we know that?

Amanda Montañez

Again, the answer comes down to balancing out the centers of mass of the two blocks, only this time, because the bottom block is five times lighter, its center of mass must end up five times farther on the tabletop to counteract the weight of the heavier block. This is known as the law of the lever—think about how a book feels heavier in your palm the farther you move it away from your body, so a paperback in a fully extended arm might feel equivalent to a textbook held close to your torso. The distance between the center of mass of the top block and the table's edge is 1⁄12, and the distance for the bottom block is 1⁄2 – 1⁄12 = 5⁄12, or five times more. A similar calculation reveals the correct overhang at every level of the tower.

Amanda Montañez

Answering our opening question (how far out can the tower extend?) amounts to adding up all of these successive overhangs. If you have 10 blocks, they can extend to 1⁄2 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄6 + 1⁄8 + 1⁄10 + 1⁄12 + 1⁄14 + 1⁄16 + 1⁄18 + 1⁄20, which adds up to about 1.464 block lengths beyond the edge. But what is the limit to how far we can stack blocks? For that, we must add infinitely many of these shrinking terms. The resulting pattern bears a striking resemblance to one of the most famous infinite sums in math, the harmonic series, which takes the reciprocal of every counting number (that is, 1 divided by every positive integer) and sums them all:

1 + 1⁄2 + 1⁄3 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄5 + ..., and so on forever.

If you look closely, you might notice that the overhangs from the block-stacking problem are exactly half of each of these terms: 1⁄2 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄6 + 1⁄8 + 1⁄10 + ...

Calculus, the branch of math that digs into how things change, teaches us that even when adding up infinitely many shrinking terms, sometimes the sum converges on a finite value and sometimes it diverges to infinity. The total of the harmonic series grows incredibly slowly. The first 100,000 terms add up to about 12.1 while the first million terms only equal around 14.4. Still, at a relentless snail's pace, the harmonic series grows forever.

Each individual overhang in the block-stacking problem equals half of a term in the harmonic series. Because half of infinity is still infinity, the tower's potential overhang also has no bound.

Of course, translating pure math into practice always comes with hurdles, but the block-stacking problem offers an amusing dexterity challenge. With only four blocks, you should be able to extend the top one a full block length past the edge (1⁄2 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄6 + 1⁄8 = ~1.042). To fulfill my journalistic due diligence, I tried this at home with playing cards on my coffee table. After a few minutes of patient tinkering, I managed to balance the top card just beyond the edge, with it hanging entirely off the table, and I felt like a magician.

Two full block lengths beyond any surface would require 31 pieces. Meanwhile100 million pieces wouldn't even get you a full 10 block lengths of overhang because the sum of the first 100 million terms in the harmonic series all divided by 2 equals about 9.5. So it will take some grit to span the Grand Canyon. At huge scales, physics kicks in to topple mathematicians' fun. But in idealized conditions where center of mass and the harmonic series alone rule the roost, the possibilities are literally endless.

Natural crystals fascinate with their vibrant colors, their nearly flawless appearance and their manifold symmetrical forms. But researchers are interested in them for quite different reasons: among the countless minerals already known, they always discover some materials with unusual magnetic properties. One of these is atacamite, which exhibits magnetocaloric behavior at low temperatures - that is, the material's temperature changes significantly when it is subjected to a magnetic field. A team headed by TU Braunschweig and the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) has now investigated this rare property (DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.216701). In the long term, the results could help to develop new materials for energy-efficient magnetic cooling.

The emerald-green mineral atacamite, named for the place it was first found, the Atacama Desert in Chile, gets its characteristic coloring from the copper ions it contains. These ions also determine the material's magnetic properties: they each have an unpaired electron whose spin gives the ion a magnetic moment - comparable to a tiny needle on a compass. "The distinct feature of atacamite is the arrangement of the copper ions," explains Dr. Leonie Heinze of Jülich Centre for Neutron Science (JCNS). "They form long chains of small, linked triangles known as sawtooth chains." This geometric structure has consequences: although the copper ions' spins always want to align themselves antiparallel to one another, the triangular arrangement makes this geometrically impossible to achieve completely. "We refer to this as magnetic frustration," continues Heinze. As result of this frustration, the spins in atacamite only arrange themselves at very low temperatures - under 9 Kelvin (−264°C) - in a static alternating structure.

When the researchers examined atacamite under the extremely high magnetic fields at HZDR's High Magnetic Field Laboratory (HLD), something surprising emerged: the material exhibited a noticeable cooling in the pulsed magnetic fields - and not just a slight one, but a drop to almost half of the original temperature. This unusually strong cooling effect particularly fascinated the researchers, as the behavior of magnetically frustrated materials in this context has scarcely been studied. However, magnetocaloric materials are considered a promising alternative to conventional cooling technologies, for example for energy-efficient cooling or the liquefaction of gases. This is because, instead of compressing and expanding a coolant - a process that takes place in every refrigerator - they can be used to change the temperature by applying a magnetic field in an environmentally friendly and potentially low-loss approach.

What is the origin of this strong magnetocaloric effect?

Additional studies at various labs of the European Magnetic Field Laboratory (EMFL) provided more in-depth insights. "By using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we were clearly able to demonstrate that the magnetic order of atacamite is destroyed when a magnetic field is applied," explains Dr. Tommy Kotte, a scientist at HLD. "This is unusual as the magnetic fields in many magnetically frustrated materials usually counteract the frustration and even encourage ordered magnetic states."

The team found the explanation for the mineral's unexpected behavior in complex numerical simulations of its magnetic structure: while the magnetic field aligns the copper ions' magnetic moments on the tips of the sawtooth chains along the field and thus reduces the frustration as expected, it is precisely these magnetic moments that mediate a weak coupling to neighboring chains. When this is removed, a long-range magnetic order can no longer exist. This also provided the team with an explanation for the particularly strong magnetocaloric effect: it always occurs when a magnetic field influences the disorder - or more precisely, the magnetic entropy - of a system. In order to compensate for this rapid change in entropy, the material has to adjust its temperature accordingly. This is the very mechanism the researchers have now managed to demonstrate in atacamite.

"Of course, we do not expect atacamite to be extensively mined in the future for use in new cooling systems," says Dr. Tommy Kotte, "but the physical mechanism we have investigated is fundamentally new and the magnetocaloric effect we observed is surprisingly strong." The team hopes their work will inspire further research, especially a targeted search for innovative magnetocaloric materials within the extensive class of magnetically frustrated systems.

Groundbreaking research by the University of Sydney has identified a new brain protein involved in the development of Parkinson's disease and a way to modify it, paving the way for future treatments for the disease.

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurological condition after dementia, with over 150,000 people in Australia living with the condition.

The research team, led by Professor Kay Double from the Brain and Mind Centre, has spent more than a decade studying the biological mechanisms underpinning the condition, with the aim of finding new treatments to slow or stop its progression.

In 2017, the team published a paper in Acta Neuropathologica, identifying for the first time the presence of an abnormal form of a protein - called SOD1 - in the brains of patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

Normally, the SOD1 protein provides protective benefits to the brain but, in Parkinson's patients, it becomes faulty, causing the protein to clump and damage brain cells.

The newest study by the same University of Sydney team, published in Acta Neuropathologica Communications,builds on this research. It found that targeting the faulty SOD1 protein with a drug treatment improved the motor function in mice bred to have Parkinson-like symptoms.

Professor Double said: "All the mice we treated saw a dramatic improvement in their motor skills which is a really promising sign it could be effective in treating people who have Parkinson disease too.

"We hoped that by treating this malfunctioning protein, we might be able to improve the Parkinson-like symptoms in the mice we were treating - but even we were astonished by the success of the intervention."

Methodology 

The study involved two groups of mice bred to have Parkinson-like symptoms. One group of mice was treated with a special copper supplement for three months, while the other received a placebo.

Throughout the study, the mice receiving the placebo saw a decline in their motor symptoms. The mice receiving the special copper supplement, however, did not develop movement problems.

Professor Double said: "The results were beyond our expectations and suggest, once further studies are carried out, this treatment approach could slow the progression of Parkinson's disease in humans."

What is Parkinson's disease?

Parkinson's disease is a degenerative neurological disorder in which dopamine-producing cells in the brain die, leading to a range of symptoms including tremors, muscle stiffness, slow movement and impaired balance.

At present there is no known cure and only limited treatments, although researchers hope understanding the causes of the disease will lead to improved treatments.

Professor Double said: "As our understanding of Parkinson's disease grows, we are finding that there are many factors contributing to its development and progression in humans - and faulty forms of the SOD1 protein is likely one of them.

"Just as researchers found with HIV, Parkinson's disease is a complex condition that likely requires multiple interventions. A single treatment may have a small effect when used alone but, when combined with other interventions, contributes to a significant overall improvement in health."

The researchers' next step is to identify the best approach to targeting the faulty SOD1 protein in a clinical trial, which could be the start of a new therapy to slow the development of Parkinson's disease.

Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), are essential for regulating movement, emotion, and reward processing. Dysfunction of DA neurons in the SNc has been linked to the Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous research mostly focuses on the functions of DA neurons in mood regulation and reward mechanisms. Their role in more subtle and spontaneous behaviors remains poorly understood.

In a study published in Translational Psychiatry, a team led by Prof. Xuemei Liu and Prof. Pengfei Wei from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered that behaviors such as rearing, walking, and hunching are associated with the loss of SNc DA neurons, but not VTA DA neurons. These subtle features serve as key behavioral biomarkers of SNc DA neuron loss, enhancing the translational value of PD models.

Using a machine learning-enhanced three-dimensional spontaneous behavior analysis system, researchers examined the detailed motor behaviors in two mouse models of dopamine neuron depletion: a subacute MPTP-induced PD model and an AAV-mediated DA neuron loss model. This approach enabled the capture of detailed and nuanced behavioral features that traditional two-dimensional methods may overlook.

Researchers observed reductions in rearing and hunching behavior in the PD model, which correlates directly with the loss of DA neurons in the SNc but not the VTA. Although overall motor deficits were not significant, notable behavioral lateralization was revealed in the PD mice.

Moreover, using the AAV-induced ablation model, researchers confirmed that climbing, a behavior similar to rearing, was also strongly correlated with the loss of DA neurons in the SNc, and the damage to SNc neurons significantly reduced motor function and influenced the lateralization of movement.

These findings highlight the significance of rearing behavior and behavioral lateralization as potential behavioral markers for tracking the progression of PD. "Connecting behavioral changes with targeted neural damage advances the understanding of PD progression and offers valuable insights into improving treatment strategies," said Prof. Liu.

Monitors with big specs often come with big price tags, but today we've got a deal that shakes things up a bit. Currently, at Amazon, you can find the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 gaming monitor at one of the lowest prices we've ever seen. It debuted with a price tag of $1,799, but right now it's available for just $959, a 47% price reduction.

As far as gaming monitors go, this one is far from casual. The Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 is massive, measuring 49 inches, and features a curved panel. It's AMD FreeSync Premium Pro certified for its performance, which is definitely what we consider top-of-the-line. We reviewed the Odyssey OLED G9 and loved it so much that we gave it our "Editor's Choice" label.

We appreciated its high-quality built-in speakers, Apple AirPlay, and Samsung TV Plus support, and perhaps most importantly, its superior gaming performance. The response time alone is also among the fastest we've measured.

This huge gaming monitor features a curved, 49-inch OLED panel. It has a 5120x1440 resolution and a high refresh rate that caps out at 240Hz. It has a superior 0.03ms refresh rate and accepts both HDMI and DisplayPort video input. It also has a USB hub for connecting peripherals.

It has a dense resolution that measures in at 5120 x 1440px and a refresh rate that can get as high as 240Hz. This is paired with a short response time of just 0.03ms, making for a noticeably snappy experience.



It covers 99% of the DCI P3 color gamut and is illuminated by a brightness that can get as high as 250 Nits. There are both HDMI and DisplayPort input options as well as 3 USB ports for connecting peripherals. It features built-in 5W speakers for audio output, eliminating the need for external audio devices.

This is one of the best gaming monitors available on the market right now and definitely worth a close look for any gamer looking to optimize their setup.

The tech world's most consequential feud has flared up again. Elon Musk and Bill Gates, two men who have shaped the modern world, are locked in a bitter public dispute, this time over foreign aid cuts with life or death stakes. The conflict pits Musk, in his role spearheading a government efficiency initiative, against Gates, the world's most prominent philanthropist.

A little over a month after Musk's departure from his role in the Trump administration, where he led efforts to slash federal spending, Gates took to X, Musk's own social network, to condemn the devastating impact of those cuts on global health.

Drawing on new reports, Gates presented a grim tally of the human cost. “A study in the Lancet recently looked at the cumulative impact of reductions in American aid. It found that, by 2040, 8 million more children will die before their fifth birthday,” Gates posted on July 3, linking to the medical journal's study.

He followed up by highlighting the threat to HIV treatment programs. “According to a @UNAIDS analysis, ending PEPFAR-supported programs for people living with HIV could result in an additional 4.2 million deaths by 2029,” Gates stated, providing a link to the report.

Driving the point home, he warned that pulling vaccine funding would have catastrophic results. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has helped immunize over 1.1 billion children since 2000. “The U.S. announced that, after this year, it's pulling out all its money,” Gates wrote. “If that happens, Gavi estimates that 75 million children will miss vaccinations over the next five years—and of those, 1.2 million children will die.”

His conclusion was blunt: “The facts are simple and devastating: Aid cuts have already cost lives, and the number of deaths will continue to rise.” Gates argued for a reversal, noting that global health is a tiny fraction of the federal budget. “In 2023, the US spent less than one percent of the federal budget on lifesaving global health programs.”

While Gates never mentioned Musk by name, the world's richest man felt targeted and seized on another user's post to launch a counterattack. The user blasted Gates, writing, “Bro, you are worth $117 billion. If you really think aid cuts are costing lives, feel free to make up the difference.”

Musk's reply was a single, cutting word: “Exactly.”

He then added a personal jab, dismissing Gates's philanthropic motives. “The real reason Gates is unhappy is that HIS organization isn't getting billions in US taxpayer money anymore.”

Exactly. 

The real reason Gates is unhappy is that HIS organization isn't getting billions in US taxpayer money anymore.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 6, 2025



As of July 5, Musk's net worth is estimated at $361 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, while Gates's fortune sits at $124 billion.

The animosity between Musk and Gates is not new. It stems from a deep grudge Musk holds over Gates for shorting Tesla stock. Think of short selling as betting on failure. A short seller borrows shares of a stock, immediately sells them, and waits for the price to crash. If it does, they buy the shares back at the new, lower price, return them to the lender, and pocket the difference. It's a high risk move that infuriates founders like Musk, who see it as a direct attack on their company. Shorting is not illegal, but it's one of the most aggressive moves you can make in the market.

Musk has never forgotten Gates's bet against his electric car company and brings it up frequently.

“Gates placed a massive bet on Tesla dying when our company was at one of its weakest moments several years ago,” Musk posted in September 2023. “Such a big short position also drives the stock down for everyday investors.”  He then added, “To the best of my knowledge, Gates still has that massive bet against Tesla on the table. Someone should ask him if he does.”

Just so that the public understands: 

Taking out a short position against Tesla, as Gates did, results in the highest return only if a company goes bankrupt!

Gates placed a massive bet on Tesla dying when our company was at one of its weakest moments several years ago. Such a…

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 11, 2023



While Gates has acknowledged placing a short position on Tesla in the past, he has never publicly confirmed if the position is still active, leaving the door open for Musk to continue fueling the feud.

There is no better time to shop for laptops on Amazon than Prime Day. As the biggest shopping event of the year for the retailer, Prime Day is when Amazon slashes prices on everything – even going as far as selling best-selling items at a loss.

This year, the Dell 15-inch 3530 laptop (Intel 10-Core i5-1334U, 1TB PCIe SSD, 32GB DDR4 RAM) is the best example of just how low these prices can go: You can pick up this beast of a machine right now for only $649, a whopping 73% off its regular price of $2,399. That's a discount of $1,750, and it makes this the best deal of all the Prime Day laptop sales. Even better, you don't have to be a Prime member to snag this deal.

See at Amazon

You'll enjoy a 13th generation Intel Core i5-1334U processor which features 10 cores that (unexpectedly) outperform the i7-1250U in the majority of tasks. That means snappy and responsive performance when you're multitasking or running demanding programs. Paired with a spacious 32GB of DDR4 RAM, this Dell laptop can handle demanding workloads and have multiple applications open in the background without slowing down.

It also comes with a massive 1TB PCIe SSD which gives you instant boot-up times, quick file transfers and plenty of space for all of your files. The SSD also helps to keep the laptop quiet and power-efficient with less heat and noise than traditional hard drives. The 15-inch full HD screen provides a clear image with a 120Hz refresh rate, and everything from spreadsheets to streamed video appears smooth.

With WiFi and Bluetooth built-in, it's easy to get online and connect your favorite wireless peripherals. The laptop has a number of ports including HDMI and USB Type-C (with an adapter), so you can hook up external monitors, storage, and more. The integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics are more than capable of handling daily visual tasks. You also get a built-in webcam.

This Dell 15 3530 laptop comes with Windows 11 Pro, and offers a secure and modern operating system that's ready to work or play straight out of the box. The non-backlit keyboard has a 10-key numeric keypad and it is ideal for anyone who works with numbers or prefers a full keyboard layout. Weighing in at only 2,200 grams (approximately 4.85 pounds) and under an inch in depth, it's light enough to carry wherever life takes you.

With Prime Day deals like this, stock is sure to move fast so don't wait too long to grab yours before this offer disappears.

AirPods Pro 2 are in stores just a year but already they set the benchmark by which other wireless earbuds with active noise cancellation are judged. On the subject of sound quality, nothing else comes close to holding a candle right now.

Normally these earbuds cost $249, but Amazon is offering them over 30% off early Prime Day, reducing the price to as low as $169. This deal is for everyone (and not just Prime members) and it is a rarity for an Apple device. Remember, Apple never really offers straight discounts and many are waiting for Prime Day or Black Friday to get Apple devices at a markdown.

See at Amazon

The AirPods Pro 2 offer an entire hearing health experience, starting with a science-based hearing test to active hearing protection as good as clinic-grade.

The intelligent noise control technology pushes it even further with active noise cancellation that takes away up to twice as much background noise as before. Transparency mode tunes you in to what's going on around you, and adaptive audio combines noise cancellation with transparency for the best listening under any conditions. Conversation awareness is another intelligent feature and it knows to turn the volume down automatically so you never miss a word when you're speaking with someone nearby.

Personalized spatial audio is one of the unique features that molds the sound to your unique ear shape and uses dynamic head tracking to deliver a surround-sound immersion: You can listen to a few select songs, TV programs and movies in Dolby Atmos, enhancing your entertainment to be more real than ever. It's easy and simple to control: swipe, press, or hold the stem to manage playback, and Siri interactions for hands-free.

With the Apple-designed H2 chip and a driver tuned by Apple, you'll have incredibly immersive sound with crisp highs and deep bass. Voice isolation technology results in your calls sounding as distinct as they do while walking down a quiet street. If you're looking for earbuds that provide high-quality audio for music, podcasts, and calling, these Apple earbuds are unbeatable.

They also come equipped with four sets of silicone tips of different sizes so that you can pick the perfect fit for your ears. The tips create an acoustic seal that prevents noise and keeps earbuds in position even during high-intensity workout or prolonged listening. The earbuds and MagSafe charging case are both IP54 certified for water, sweat, and dust resistance.

Battery life is also a plus with up to six hours of playtime on one battery with active noise cancellation enabled and up to thirty hours total with the case. The case itself is full of functionality and includes precision finding, a built-in speaker, and a durable lanyard loop for easy carrying. It is supported by several charging styles, including Apple Watch and MagSafe chargers, USB-C, and Qi-certified wireless chargers.

For only $169 early Prime Day, AirPods Pro 2 are now as affordable as most cheap earbuds without sacrificing any of it. Make sure you grab yours before they run out of stock.

Amazon brought forward Prime Day this year by a week, and the weekend's best deals are already out there. That doesn't leave you much time if you want to get your hands on one of the most popular deals before they are… gone. The best-selling cordless vacuum on Amazon from Shark is currently being offered at an all-time low price.

Over 20,000 units have been sold in only a few hours, reports Amazon, and with demand this high, it could be gone tomorrow. It's a no-brainer at this price point: there simply is no competition. This Shark pet cordless vacuum cleaner retails for just $149 which is a massive discount from its normal price of $299. This 50% off is a record low for this model.

See at Amazon

Powered by a 21.6-volt battery, it provides hypervelocity suction that conquers all from ordinary dust to high-traffic messes. Whether you are cleaning hard floors, carpets, or bare floors, the bristle brushroll and heavy-duty suction make everything a breeze. The vacuum weighs only 6.9 pounds and is easy to maneuver across your home, and the low-profile design means you can fit under furniture and in tight spaces.

You will love its 40-minute battery life which means you can clean the entire home on a single charge. The detachable handheld vacuum is perfect for cleaning above floor so you can reach pet hair on the couch or crumbs in the car. Shark includes both a pet multi-tool and crevice tool so it's easy to reach into corners and clean up annoying pet hair.

Shark pet cordless vacuum cleaner also has an XL dust cup with a CleanTouch Dirt Ejector so you can empty dirt without getting your hands dirty. And another cool feature is self-standing storage: simply pull out the hand vac and hang it onto the end of the wand base which is very handy even in small spaces. By the way, this machine is both carpet and hard floor friendly.

iRobot and its Roomba line have been the benchmark for robot vacuums. When it comes to the top of home cleaning luxury, the Roomba Plus 405 combo robot vacuum and mop (including a a cleaning dock) is a real reference point.

This product has only just been released and, up until now, has never been discounted. For (early) Prime Day, Amazon has an amazing 50% discount and brings the price down to $399 from its usual price of $799. Looks like Amazon is clearing out stock with no margin left, make sure you don't miss this opportunity.

See at Amazon

The Roomba Plus 405 is a complete cleaning system that is designed to handle both mopping and vacuuming with amazing efficiency. It possesses 70 times more suction power than the Roomba 600 series and devours messes ranging from everyday crumbs to stubborn pet footprints. The dual spinning mop pads (when paired with SmartScrub technology) deliver double the scrubbing power and downward pressure of standard vacuum and mop modes so even dried-on grime and dried-up spills get cleaned appropriately. With cleaning solution or even water, it performs amazingly well on carpets and hard floors.

The ClearView LiDAR system maps your house quickly and optimizes coverage for an in-depth clean every time. It moves smoothly around furniture and obstructions and special sensors prevent it from tumbling down stairs or getting stuck. This intelligent mapping allows you to target the cleaning to specific rooms or zones with Clean Zones and you can even set Keep Out Zones to avoid sensitive spots or pet food bowls.

The AutoWash dock is a revolutionizer and offers up to 75 days of self-emptying and four weeks of mopping and pad washing with zero involvement. The dock is continuously rinsing and drying the mop pads so you receive a sanitary clean, day after day. This way, you can enjoy a spick-and-span home for weeks at a stretch without lifting a finger.

Scheduling your cleaning has never been easier with the latest Roomba Home app: Easy to navigate, the app enables you to make personalized cleaning schedules, track the condition of your filter, receive time estimates, and see the areas that need the most cleaning. You may also instruct your robot using your voice assistant of choice or simply push the buttons on the unit itself.

This is the first time this flagship Roomba has been discounted, and at half price, it's an offer you won't want to miss.

Amazon rolled out its initial Prime Day offers this weekend, in the form of the Prime Early Deal event. You have to be a Prime member to qualify for these exclusive offers but if you are not a member, Amazon offers a free 30-day trial so you can take advantage of all the Prime Day sales.

Among many active noise cancelation headphones out there, Sony remains in the top brands and its WH-1000XM4 model is as mature as the newest version. Thanks to the Prime Day sale, you can have the WH-1000XM4 for nearly three times less than the new one, and it's an all-time low.

Right now, the Sony 1000XM4 headphones are available for just $185 on Amazon, down from the original $348 list price. That's a huge 47% discount which makes this the perfect time to invest in premium audio gear.

See at Amazon

The WH-1000XM4 offers a great listening experience and it is powered by industry-leading active noise cancellation with dual noise sensor technology. Commuting, working in an open office space, or at home: these headphones cancel distractions and let you stay on your music or calls. The adaptive sound control system automatically adjusts the noise cancellation based on your environment and activities and offers you a tailor-made audio experience with each use.

Battery life is also really impressive if you go for thus one: You get 30 hours of playback from a single charge, and in case you run late, a 10-minute charge can give you a maximum of five hours of music time. USB Type-C is employed here for charging the headphones which is handy because you can use the same cable to charge a lot of modern devices.

You'll simply control your music and calls with touch sensor controls on the earcups: Play, pause, skip songs, adjust the volume, activate your voice assistant, and answer a call with a touch or swipe. The speak-to-chat feature is also a pleasant touch and automatically lowers volume as you start talking so you don't have to navigate through controls.

Music lovers will love the DSEE Extreme engine co-developed with Sony Music Studios Tokyo, which upscales compressed digital music files in real time for richer, more detailed sound.

Keep in mind that at $185 during Prime Day, it's an offer that you shouldn't resist.

Used stock BIOS and stock voltage.

TrashBench, an overclocking and BIOS tuning enthusiast, has pushed the old favorite Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 to 2,202 MHz using a DIY cooler. The Redditor and TechTuber stuck to the aging GeForce's stock BIOS and stock voltage, but the home-made copper pipe cooling can only be reasonably described as ‘something else.' Aesthetics aside, the cooler propelled this card to a stunning five-fold victory in the official 3DMark Fire Strike chart (for systems packing a Core i5-12600KF).

With their trusty old Asus GTX 1060 6GB in hand, TrashBench removed the stock cooler and prepared for the GPU refit by crushing an assortment of copper piping lengths, acquired from a home DIY store, for better component contact.

Next, the now adjusted lengths of copper pipe were positioned over strategic areas of the PCB (VRMs, VRAM), and G-clamped in place. A water block and pump were attached to the GPU, and flexible pipes included the copper lengths in a loop – fed by a sizable jerry can of iced water for the reservoir.

With the DIY cooler setup ready to roll, and sensibly attached some distance from the host PC using a lengthy riser cable, TrashBench started work. Fiddling with the curves in MSI Afterburner, they walked the GPU clocks up, while monitoring temperatures. “I ended up with a pretty clean 2,202 MHz on the core stable enough for a full Firestrike run, and a score good enough to crack into the global Top 5 for GTX 1060s and a 12600kf,” noted TrashBench. But we notice they subsequently got six of the top six scores – even better.

For context, the stock cooled Asus GeForce GTX 1060 that TrashBench started with achieved an ‘excellent' 12,675 Fire Strike score just ahead of the modding work. With the new plumbing in place, it maxed out with a score of 14,302. That's almost a 13% improvement in the overall benchmark score.

TrashBench now has their eye on some fun based on a GTX 1080 Ti, and teased the possibility of adding voltage mods to the tuning mix for this legendary GPU. Stay tuned.

COD's anti-cheat proves no match for hackers.

Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2023 promised to usher in a new era of harmony between PC and console. As such, Activision's marquee title, Call of Duty, has been slowly making its way over to Xbox and PC Game Pass. Now backed by an unfaltering tech giant, Call of Duty has maintained the servers for their older live-service games despite the franchise's annual release cadence. One of these games is Call of Duty: WWII, released in 2017 and still going strong in 2025... up until it was hacked to oblivion over the weekend.

COD: WW2 landed on Game Pass a few days ago, enabling millions to try the game for the first time, and while everything was going smooth over on the console side, mayhem ensued across the PC sector. According to various reports online, hackers have apparently taken over the game with the help of RCE exploits, leading to some relentless trolling.

Gamers are going ballisticCall of Duty WWII, available on Xbox PC Game Pass, contains an unpatched RCE exploitSomeone is trolling gamers with Notepad pop ups, PC shutdowns, and gay pornography pic.twitter.com/FLNzRbLt1sJuly 3, 2025

For context, RCE stands for remote code execution and is a way of running malicious code on a computer without actually needing to be there in person. The bad actor gets access to your computer through loopholes in the security system, then injects a payload containing said malicious code that can wreak havoc on your computer. So far, there have been no reports of any serious harm done to COD: WWII players, but this is a dangerous tactic, nonetheless.

It's important to note that such exploits can only really work on PC since consoles do not provide the level of code execution freedom a conventional computer does, in order to pursue these shenanigans. Obviously, consoles do get hacked, but this particular issue is exclusive to PC and, unfortunately, has been a common occurrence with older COD titles for a long time.

Activision introduced its "Ricochet" anti-cheat system in 2019—with COD: Modern Warfare—to combat things like this. Since then, the publisher has iterated on the tech with Ricochet 2, making its anti-cheat harder and harder to crack. Therefore, without the level of protection needed against malicious operators, COD: WWII, which came out two years prior to Ricochet's introduction, is apparently fair game for hacking.

Moreover, COD: WWII still relies on P2P matchmaking, an archaic way of connecting two players (and their computers) together in order to enable multiplayer. This method has been succeeded with a dedicated server model in which all players connect to the server, which receives their input and sends it back and forth in real-time. As you could probably guess, directly connecting two players to each other leaves a lot of vulnerability on the table, which hackers exploited in the case of COD: WWII.

In response to this, Activision has since taken the game offline from the Microsoft Store, for some reason, despite the game still being available on Steam and PC Game Pass. It doesn't matter where you get the game from, the entirety of the PC platform is affected by this, so please avoid playing Call of Duty: WWII until this matter is resolved.

📢 Call of Duty: WWIICall of Duty: WWII on PC Microsoft Store was brought offline while we investigate reports of an issueJuly 5, 2025

The damage, however, has already been done with several users being hacked over the weekend. In one video uploaded to X, a streamer got hacked while they were live and their desktop wallpaper was quickly changed to show an Activision lawyer. More interestingly, though, @LasagneManne revealed what looks like the exact tool these hackers are using to pull off their exploits. It includes standard options like kicking players off the server or enabling things like "God Mode," alongside the RCE button. Let's hope Activision has a patch ready to address this unfettered access soon enough.

4K gaming monitors often cost an arm and a leg if you want to get one, but Newegg is giving you a rather short chance to save big today.

You'd better get the Switch 2 console before tariffs strike.

President Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam, which puts a 20% tariff on all goods originating from the country. This might seem like a good deal, especially as the latter originally had a 46% tariff before Trump paused the tariffs he put on all the U.S.'s trade partners for 90 days, dropping down the numbers to just 10%. Unfortunately, Nintendo, which manufactures the Switch 2 consoles in Vietnam, used the 10% tariff amount for its earnings forecast, according to PCMag. This means that the tariff change may throw a wrench into its plans.

The Nintendo Switch 2 launch has been relatively successful, with the company selling 3.5 million units on the opening weekend and obliterating the record of the original Switch by a full million. But despite seemingly arriving in good numbers in the U.S. and the U.K., customers from other countries have complained of shortages, with its president, Shuntaro Furukawa, apologizing to shareholders for failing to anticipate the massive demand.

It has also been a victim of geopolitics, with the console revealed to the world on April 2, 2025 — the same day that Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs, which imposed massive taxes on Vietnamese goods. This meant that the $449 launch price of the console might no longer be viable and could force Nintendo and its retailers to hike up their prices. This led to a delay in pre-orders, as the company was probably considering its next moves. Thankfully, these massive tariffs were suspended for 90 days starting April 9, even though a base 10% tariff remained. Despite that, Nintendo was able to retain the original launch price console and had pre-orders starting on April 24 — accessories saw modest price increases, though.

One thing that the company counted on was that the tariffs for Vietnamese goods would remain at 10%. However, this is not the case, and the recent tariff increase might be too much for the company to absorb the changes. As of now, there is no finalized official document, yet, that confirms these changes, so we don't know if and when this will take effect. Nintendo is likely holding its breath until everything is finalized before making an announcement. But if the 20% tariff is implemented, we might see the price of the Switch 2 jump from $450 to $500.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

When Todd Sacktor was about to turn 3, his 4-year-old sister died of leukemia. “An empty bedroom next to mine. A swing set with two seats instead of one,” he said, recalling the lingering traces of her presence in the house. “There was this missing person—never spoken of—for which I had only one memory.” That memory, faint but enduring, was set in the downstairs den of their home. A young Sacktor asked his sister to read him a book, and she brushed him off: “Go ask your mother.” Sacktor glumly trudged up the stairs to the kitchen.

It's remarkable that, more than 60 years later, Sacktor remembers this fleeting childhood moment at all. The astonishing nature of memory is that every recollection is a physical trace, imprinted into brain tissue by the molecular machinery of neurons. How the essence of a lived moment is encoded and later retrieved remains one of the central unanswered questions in neuroscience.

Sacktor became a neuroscientist in pursuit of an answer. At the State University of New York Downstate in Brooklyn, he studies the molecules involved in maintaining the neuronal connections underlying memory. The question that has always held his attention was first articulated in 1984 by the famed biologist Francis Crick: How can memories persist for years, even decades, when the body's molecules degrade and are replaced in a matter of days, weeks or, at most, months?

In 2024, working alongside a team that included his longtime collaborator André Fenton, a neuroscientist at New York University, Sacktor offered a potential explanation in a paper published in Science Advances. The researchers discovered that a persistent bond between two proteins is associated with the strengthening of synapses, which are the connections between neurons. Synaptic strengthening is thought to be fundamental to memory formation. As these proteins degrade, new ones take their place in a connected molecular swap that maintains the bond's integrity and, therefore, the memory.

In 1984, Francis Crick described a biological conundrum: Memories last years, while most molecules degrade in days or weeks. “How then is memory stored in the brain so that its trace is relatively immune to molecular turnover?” he wrote in Nature.

The researchers present “a very convincing case” that “the interaction between these two molecules is needed for memory storage,” said Karl Peter Giese, a neurobiologist at King's College London who was not involved with the work. The findings offer a compelling response to Crick's dilemma, reconciling the discordant timescales to explain how ephemeral molecules maintain memories that last a lifetime.

Early in his career, Sacktor made a discovery that would shape the rest of his life. After studying under the molecular memory pioneer James Schwartz at Columbia University, he opened his own lab at SUNY Downstate to search for a molecule that might help explain how long-term memories persist.

The molecule he was looking for would be in the brain's synapses. In 1949, the psychologist Donald Hebb proposed that repeatedly activating neurons strengthens the connections between them, or, as the neurobiologist Carla Shatz later put it: “Cells that fire together, wire together.” In the decades since, many studies have suggested that the stronger the connection between neurons that hold memories, the better the memories persist.

In the early 1990s, in a dish in his lab, Sacktor stimulated a slice of a rat's hippocampus—a small region of the brain linked to memories of events and places, such as the interaction Sacktor had with his sister in the den—to activate neural pathways in a way that mimicked memory encoding and storage. Then he searched for any molecular changes that had taken place. Every time he repeated the experiment, he saw elevated levels of a certain protein within the synapses. “By the fourth time, I was like, this is it,” he said.

It was protein kinase M zeta, or PKMζ for short. As the rats' hippocampal tissue was stimulated, synaptic connections strengthened and levels of PKMζ increased. By the time he published his findings in 1993, he was convinced that PKMζ was crucial for memory.

Todd Sacktor has devoted his career to pursuing the molecular nature of memory.

Over the next two decades, he would go on to build a body of work showing that PKMζ's presence helps maintain memories long after their initial formation. When Sacktor blocked the molecule's activity an hour after a memory was formed, he saw that synaptic strengthening was reversed. This discovery suggested that PKMζ was “necessary and sufficient” to preserve a memory over time, he wrote in Nature Neuroscience in 2002. In contrast, hundreds of other localized molecules impacted synaptic strengthening only if disrupted within a few minutes of a memory's formation. It appeared to be a singular molecular key to long-term memory.

To test his hypothesis in live animals, he teamed up with Fenton, who worked at SUNY Downstate at the time and had experience training lab animals and running behavioral experiments. In 2006, the duo published their first paper showing that blocking PKMζ could erase rats' memories a day or a month after they had formed. This suggested that the persistent activity of PKMζ is required to maintain a memory.

The paper was a bombshell. Sacktor and Fenton's star protein PKMζ gained widespread attention, and labs around the world found that blocking it could erase various types of memories, including those related to fear and taste. PKMζ seemed like a sweeping explanation for how memories form and are maintained at the molecular level. But then their hypothesis lost momentum. Other researchers genetically engineered mice to lack PKMζ, and in 2013, two independent studies showed that these mice could still form memories. This cast doubt on the protein's role and brought much of the ongoing research to a halt.

Sacktor and Fenton were undeterred. “We knew we had to figure it out,” Sacktor said. In 2016, they published a rebuttal, demonstrating that in the absence of PKMζ, mice recruit a backup mechanism, involving another molecule, to strengthen synapses.

The existence of a compensatory molecule wasn't a surprise. “The biological system is not such that you lose one molecule and everything goes. That's very rare,” Giese said. But identifying this compensatory molecule prompted a new question: How did it know where to go to replace PKMζ? It would take Sacktor and Fenton nearly another decade to find out.

A classic test of a molecule's importance is to block it and see what breaks. Determined to pin down PKMζ's role once and for all, Sacktor and Fenton set out to design a way to disrupt it more precisely than ever before. They developed a new molecule to inhibit the activity of PKMζ. It “worked beautifully,” Sacktor said. But it wasn't clear how.

One day in 2020, Matteo Bernabo, a graduate student from a collaborating lab at McGill University, was presenting findings related to the PKMζ inhibitor when a clue emerged from the audience. “I suggested that it worked by blocking the PKMζ's interaction with KIBRA,” recalled Wayne Sossin, a neuroscientist at McGill.

KIBRA is a scaffolding protein. Like an anchor, it holds other proteins in place inside a synapse. In the brain, it is abundant in regions associated with learning and memory. “It's not a protein that a lot of people work on,” Sossin said, but there is considerable “independent evidence that KIBRA has something to do with memory”—and even that it is associated with PKMζ. Most research has focused on KIBRA's role in cancer. “In the nervous system,” he said, “there are only three or four of us [studying it].” Sacktor and Fenton joined them.

André Fenton and his team found that an interaction between two proteins is key to keeping memory intact over time.

To find out if KIBRA and PKMζ work together in response to synaptic activity, the researchers used a technique that makes interacting proteins glow. When they applied electrical pulses to hippocampal slices, glowing dots of evidence appeared: Following bursts of synaptic activity that produced long-term synaptic strengthening, a multitude of KIBRA-PKMζ complexes formed, and they were persistent.

Then the team tested the bond during real memory formation by giving mice a drug to disrupt the formation of these complexes. They saw that the mice's synaptic strength and task memory were lost—and that once the drug wore off, the erased memory did not return, but the mice could acquire and remember new memories once again.

But are the KIBRA-PKMζ complexes needed to maintain memory over the long term? To find out, the researchers disrupted the complex four weeks after a memory was formed. Doing so did indeed wipe out the memory. This suggested that the interaction between KIBRA and PKMζ is crucial not only for forming memories, but also for keeping them intact over time.

“It's the persistent association between two proteins that maintains the memory, rather than a protein that lasts by itself for the lifetime of the memory,” said Panayiotis Tsokas, a neuroscientist working with Sacktor and lead author on the new Science Advances paper.

The KIBRA and PKMζ proteins stabilize each other by forming a bond. That way, when a protein degrades and needs to be replaced, the other remains in place. The bond itself and its location at the specific synapses that were activated during learning are preserved, allowing a new partner to slot itself in, perpetuating the alliance over time. Individually, PKMζ and KIBRA don't last a lifetime—but by binding to each other, they help ensure your memories might.

The discovery addresses the conundrum first identified by Crick, namely how memories persist despite the relatively short lifetimes of all biological molecules. “There had to be a very, very interesting answer, an elegant answer, for how this could come about,” Fenton said. “And that elegant answer is the KIBRA-PKMζ interacting story.”

This work also answers a question that researchers had put on the shelf. Sacktor's earlier study showed that increasing levels of PKMζ strengthened synapses and memories. But how did the molecule know where to go within the neuron? “We figured, well, one day, maybe we'll understand that,” Sacktor said. Now, the researchers think that KIBRA acts as a synaptic tag that guides PKMζ. If true, this would help explain how only the specific synapses involved in a particular physical memory trace are strengthened, when a neuron may have thousands of synapses that connect it to various other cells.

“These experiments very nicely show that KIBRA is necessary for maintaining the activity of PKMζ at the synapse,” said David Glanzman, a neurobiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the study. However, he cautioned that this doesn't necessarily translate to maintaining memory because synaptic strengthening is not the only model for how memory works.

Glanzman's own past research on sea slugs at first appeared to show that disrupting a molecule analogous to PKMζ erases memory. “Originally, I said it was erased,” Glanzman said, “but later experiments showed we could bring the memory back.” These findings prompted him to reconsider whether memory is truly stored as changes in the strength of synaptic connections. Glanzman, who has worked for 40 years under the synaptic model, is a recent proponent of an alternative view called the molecular-encoding model, which posits that molecules inside a neuron store memories.

While he has no doubt that synaptic strengthening follows memory formation, and that PKMζ plays a major role in this process, he remains unsure if the molecule also stores the memory itself. Still, Glanzman emphasized that this study addresses some of the challenges of the synaptic model, such as molecular turnover and synapse targeting, by “providing evidence that KIBRA and PKMζ form a complex that is synapse-specific and persists longer than either individual molecule.”

Although Sacktor and Fenton believe that this protein pair is fundamental to memory, they know that there may be other factors yet to be discovered that help memories persist. Just as PKMζ led them to KIBRA, the complex might lead them further still.

I say it's wrong because months ago I heard arguments that models predicted that lowering the curve could also reduce total mortality. And I linked to that video to give evidence that this was part of the general discussion months ago.The fact that you disagree with that model, or argue that I need to give a stronger evidence for the current information we have, has no bearing on my point.Eg, when you write "I don't believe this is the situation right now" - that statement is based on knowledge you have now, not knowledge that people had on "day 1".

Nowadays it seems both EU & US hasn't pursued heavy suppression (probably too costly, and legally and culturally difficult), but rather just hoping to keep it somewhat under control until a vaccine comes, hopefully.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup has been the source of much discussion, not all of which has been positive. 

Justifiable concerns over how the tournament has further bloated the already congested football calendar has undoubtedly impacted the tournament's global appeal, with attendances at stadiums across the United States suffering as a result. Sparsely-filled arenas have been a consistent talking point. 

The limited interest in the competition has massively affected ticket prices, with Chelsea's semifinal against Brazilian outfit Fluminense the latest to see prices plummet before kickoff. 

Here's the latest news on the competition's ticket pricing. 

On July 2, those interested in attending Chelsea's semifinal battle with Fluminense would have had to fork out an astonishing $473 (£346) for the cheapest standard admission ticket. For context, that's marginally more expensive than the cheapest Premier League season ticket at West Ham United for the 2024–25 season. 

However, prices have drastically dipped since last Wednesday, with tickets now available for as little as $13.40 (£9.81). There has been a sharp decline in recent days due to a lack of demand for the fixture, which takes place at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 8. It's worth noting that the match kicks off at 3 p.m. ET on Tuesday in the United States, further limiting the amount of people who can attend. 

Prices have sharply declined and are now available for just 2.8% of their original standard admission price within the space of three days. It remains unclear whether those who have purchased more expensive tickets before price drops will be refunded. 

Tickets for the clash between Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid in the other semifinal are still commanding an enormous fee. As of Sunday afternoon, the cheapest available tickets are $195.15 (£142.91), but it's possible that prices drop before the match kicks off on July 9. 

FIFA have employed dynamic ticket pricing in conjunction with Ticketmaster for the 2025 Club World Cup, meaning prices change depending on demand. That can mean wild swings in costs for supporters and an unpredictable pricing structure. 

The average attendance at Club World Cup group stage matches was just over 35,000 and while that has resulted in certain venues reaching near full capacity, others have been alarmingly empty. FIFA have attempted to remedy this by reducing ticket prices as the tournament has progressed, especially for less desirable fixtures. 

Chelsea's win over Palmeiras and Fluminense's clash with Al Hilal in last Friday's quarterfinals were both available to view live for just $11 (£8.06). It's a move which has helped boost attendances at a major financial cost.

Seven months ago, U.S. soccer fans knew Diego Luna as the guy who broke his nose. 

Now he's the breakout star for the U.S. men's national team, and he is on the verge of a Gold Cup trophy against rivals Mexico.

Even before that injury in a game against Costa Rica back in January, it's been an eventful ride for the 21-year-old, recognizable by his platinum hair and his tattoos. Last summer, he was cut from the U.S. Olympic team ahead of the Paris Games. He became a father to a baby boy. He was recently voted an MLS All-Star for his club Real Salt Lake.

Now, he's scoring goals and wowing USMNT fans, who'll hope the 5-foot-8 playmaker will stand out once again against Mexico in Sunday's grand finale in Houston (coverage begins at 6 p.m. ET on FOX). 

Either way, Luna's big summer has put him in prime position to play his way onto the USMNT roster for the 2026 World Cup. 

I caught up with the electric playmaker about cheering for the U.S. over Mexico as a kid, his motivation, and if he plans to get another tattoo if he lifts the Gold Cup. 

What's your earliest memory of soccer? When do you remember first becoming aware of the game?

I think just being at a field with my older brother, and my dad was coaching. I think I was about four.

What's your first memory of the U.S.-Mexico rivalry?

I know there's a story going around, but I just remember being at, like, a family gathering. Half of my family was rooting for Mexico. I was cheering for the U.S. I just remember getting mad whenever Mexico would score. It was like a little beef between me and my family members, there'd be little comments. But it was cool. It was all in fun. I don't remember which game it was. I think it was the one where Giovani dos Santos scored on a chip [for Mexico in the 2011 Gold Cup final]. 

You're from California, but you could have represented Mexico instead of the U.S. What was it like having both options?

Yeah, they contacted me about playing for them when I was with the [U.S.] under-20s. But that was a long time ago now.

Were you a fan of any particular team growing up?

I've always liked Real Madrid. And my brother was a big Liverpool fan, so I also liked watching them.

Who was your favorite player?

Marco Reus. I just liked the way he played, the way he controlled the game. It's too bad I haven't gotten the chance to play against him in MLS yet.

Two of a kind? Germany star Marco Reus is a favorite of Diego Luna. (Getty Images) 

Are you a fan of other sports teams?

Not really. I like golf and boxing. I do kind of like the Dallas Cowboys. It was very cool that we were able to use their locker room a few weeks ago [for the win over Haiti in the Gold Cup group stage].

Favorite athletes outside of soccer?

Tiger Woods. Canelo [Álvarez, the Mexican boxer]. Serena Williams.

Did you play other sports besides soccer as a kid?

You might be surprised, but I played volleyball and basketball.

You overlapped with Mexico defender Julian Araujo when you were at the Barcelona residency academy in Arizona. What would it be like to face him in the final?

It would be cool. He's two years older than me, so we didn't really play together that much. But it's always good to see people you know succeed.

What would you be doing if you weren't a soccer player?

Man, that's tough. A firefighter maybe.

OK, obviously I have to ask about your tats. How many do you have?

Honestly, I don't even know. … It's really hard to say. Do I count all the ones on my fingers separately?

I know the first one you got to commemorate your niece's birthday. How old is she now? Does she know about it?

Yeah, she knows about it. She's seven now. She thinks it's cool.

Does she know that you kiss that wrist when you score?

I guess she will now. My son's name is on that same wrist, too, so that's also part of it.

Will you get a new tattoo if you win the Gold Cup?

Yeah, definitely. I don't know what exactly yet but yes.

Who has been the most influential person in your life?

My dad. He's always been there for me, and he made a lot of sacrifices for me.

What has been the hardest moment of your career so far?

Not making the Olympic team last year. That really hurt. I had to refocus and make sure that I was staying positive and I just doubled down on putting in the work. It was a big disappointment in the moment but it kind of helped me in the end, you know? That setback helped get me to where I am today.

What's your ultimate goal in soccer?

I want to take care of my family, make sure they are secure, be able to secure their future financially. Right now, everything is about my son. He motivates me to keep pushing. Having a son has really put everything into perspective for me.

This particular Gold Cup roster came into camp with just an average of 16 caps. There were a lot of question marks entering the tournament as to whether this rather inexperienced USMNT squad was talented and capable enough to lift the Concacaf trophy in July.

Several USMNT mainstays missed the Gold Cup due to injury, the FIFA Club World Cup or personal reasons, but the players on the roster saw it as an opportunity to tune out the noise and write their own story.

“We've dealt with a lot of adversity, but we've done it with a lot of heart,” defender Chris Richards said. “I think that's been the big thing this summer.”

The summer didn't start easily with two losses to UEFA teams, Türkiye and Switzerland, in international friendlies in early June. However, the USA quickly turned the page in the Gold Cup and didn't look back. The Americans came out of Group D on top, winning all three group matches. Then they knocked out Costa Rica and Guatemala in the quarter and semifinals, respectively.

“We're all eyes on Houston, and we want to win a whole trophy,” Richards said.

The USA will face Mexico in the Gold Cup Final at NRG Stadium on July 6 (7 p.m. ET on FOX).

Fellow center back and veteran leader Tim Ream said that this opportunity wasn't just happenstance. It was an intentional effort to develop chemistry on and off the field.

“What happens on the field doesn't just magically appear,” Ream said. “It takes time, and it's something that we've cultivated throughout these last four weeks. Without all the togetherness, without fighting for each other, without standing shoulder to shoulder, without having each other's backs, we don't get to this point to be able to fight for that.”

The knockout round proved to be the biggest catalyst in bringing the team together— a penalty shootout in the quarterfinal and a physical, competitive semifinal.

Now, the USMNT will face its biggest rival El Tri, for the eighth time in a Gold Cup Final. Its southern neighbor is favored over the Americans, and for the first time this tournament the U.S. enters a match as the underdog.

This isn't anything new for this group. They came into the tournament feeling overlooked, and now hope to finish as champions.

“It's something as players, you always want to be able to do,” Ream said. “You want to be able to play for trophies, you want to win trophies. And so, now here we are.”

Chelsea bagged an additional £15.5million after defeating Palmeiras in the Club World Cup quarter-finals early Saturday morning, taking their total earnings from the tournament to more than £61million.

Manager Enzo Maresca handed a debut to new recruit Joao Pedro during the 2-1 victory, following his immediate arrival in the States after finalising his transfer from Brighton. The win against the Brazilian side in Philadelphia effectively helps cover Pedro's £60million transfer fee, with the potential for further financial gain on the horizon.

The Blues are set to face another Brazilian team, Fluminense, in the semi-finals on Tuesday night in New York, with at least £21.9million up for grabs should they secure a win. This is the amount they stand to earn if they progress to the final.

If Chelsea clinch the contentious competition, they could pocket around £90million - a significant sum that would alleviate concerns of any financial fair play violations amidst another summer of hefty spending in the transfer market. They've already acquired Liam Delap from Ipswich for £30million and completed a deal for Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund.

 Despite the substantial prize money at stake, head coach Maresca has maintained throughout the group stages that he feels no extra pressure from the club's owners due to the potential financial windfall, reports the Mirror. 

"The owners just want the best for us and for the players game by game, and they are not talking about the final prize or the final reward in terms of money," Maresca said before playing ES Tunis. "They never put pressure on me or the players in terms of we need to win this tournament because of the money."

Chelsea began their FIFA Club World Cup journey with a guaranteed participation fee of around £25million, bolstered by an additional £3million from two group stage victories and £5.5million for advancing to the round of 16. Their triumph over Benfica netted them a further £9.7million, while defeating Palmeiras added another £15.5million to their earnings.

Despite Manchester City's unexpected exit at the round of 16 against Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia, they still amassed over £40million in prize money, including the full participation award of £27.9million.

FIFA Club World Cup prize money breakdown:.

- Group stage: $2million (£1.47million) per win, $1million (£740,000) per draw for each club.

- Round of 16: $7.5million (£5.5million).

- Quarter-final: $13.125million (£9.67million).

- Semi-final: $21million (£15.46million).

- Finalist: $30million (£22.1million).

- Winner: $40million (£29.46million).

The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.

Club World Cup

Today's News

Connections: Sports Edition

Over the past few weeks, the first-ever 32-team Club World Cup has whittled itself down to a tidy quartet. This isn't a midsummer UEFA Champions League either, with non-European challenger Fluminense up against a few of the modern era's usual suspects: Chelsea, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain. Are they in position to give Gianni Infantino an unexpected champion to justify this expensive experiment?

As we near the business end of this opulent summer spectacle, let's make one final projection of which remaining side is most likely to win the first expanded Club World Cup. Unlike our pre-tournament rankings that focused on the historical might of each team, this latest edition of Club World Cup power rankings is designed to live very much in the present. Simply: now that the competition is down to the final four teams, who's in the best form, and who has the best chance to win the trophy?

Bear in mind that the stage at which each club exited the tournament determines its tier of the rankings. While you may have left the Round of 16 feeling less confident in Inter Miami's showing than Atlético Madrid, the La Liga side's elimination in a tough group capped its highest-possible ranking at 17th. Likewise, even a strong tournament from Bayern Munich until that chaotic and gruesome conclusion against PSG means it must slot in beneath your perceived weakest semifinalist.

In this series finale, we'll look at the performances which have led each team to the doorstep of a lucrative tournament final. We'll also highlight one notable player — either a new addition who rapidly acclimated, a mainstay who carried his team through tough matchups or a rising prospect who may have set themselves up for more involvement in the league thanks to a standout display or two.

First things first: let's determine the pecking order for the eliminated quarterfinalists (movement from the previous installment indicated in parentheses) before slotting each semifinalist accordingly.

8. Borussia Dortmund (down 1)
7. Al Hilal (down 1)
6. Palmeiras (down 2)

4. Fluminense (up 4)

Throughout a headline-stealing group stage that saw each of the field's Brazilian clubs rack up statement results against European rivals, Fluminense was perhaps the least heralded of the quartet. Some of this was circumstantial given their draw: a relatively weak group saw Fluminense beat Ulsan HD 4-2 and notch scoreless draws against Borussia Dortmund and Mamelodi Sundowns. None of the results were nearly as eye-catching as, say, a win over PSG or Chelsea, but they finished second in Group F and fell into what became the thinner half of the bracket. A team can only beat the opposition in front of them, and so on.

None of this is to call Fluminense's status as the final non-UEFA team in contention a fluke — far from it. The knockout bracket has seen the 2023 Copa Libertadores champion thwart Inter Milan before outlasting Al Hilal fresh from the Saudi side's takedown of Manchester City. Ageless goalkeeper Fabio has already logged five more appearances as he nears football immortality, and it isn't just stat-padding either. His 2.21 goals prevented (when comparing conceded goals to post-shot expected goals, or ‘xGOT', faced) is the second-highest rate of the four remaining goalkeepers and fifth-best in the entire tournament. When weighted for shot volume faced, his goal prevention rate of 73.8 percent is third-best in the 32-team field, trailing only Thibaut Courtois and Gianluigi Donnarumma.

Otherwise, it has largely been a success-by-committee approach. Defensive midfielder Hércules leads the team with two goals, with six others having scored once apiece to propel their team through the tournament. Jhon Arias has been the industrious one of the bunch, leading his team in shots (13) and chances created (17) despite having just one goal and one assist to date. Perhaps a date with Chelsea and its at-times overwhelmed defense can help him turn his effort into greater end product. In defense, no team has done better to limit their opponents' shooting threat with a field-best 0.072 xG per shot faced.

Either way, Fluminense has done what every team from beyond Europe hoped to achieve: be the furthest-advancing “Rest of World” team. Their big-game presence has also been welcome from FIFA's perspective, ensuring the type of matchup variety that is frankly mandatory to sustain interest in a new tournament like this.

3. Chelsea (up 2)

In the aftermath of Chelsea's blown lead against Flamengo, which saw Nicolas Jackson sent off, the nature of the meltdown felt like an omen that Enzo Maresca's side couldn't be considered a tournament favorite. The mental lapses that cost Chelsea results in the Premier League had followed the Blues stateside, it seemed, and while Chelsea couldn't be discounted entirely, the field's more consistent or opportunistic sides would eventually see it out. And yet, the club weathered that mid-group defeat to get back on track in time for knockout dates with Benfica and Palmeiras.

First, the concerns. Only one player in this tournament has attempted more shots than Cole Palmer (16), yet the England international has just one goal to show for those efforts. Palmer seems to be forcing it at times, maintaining a very poor 0.06 xG per shot rate that suggests his teammates are struggling to get him looks in more dangerous situations.



The plus side is that Chelsea has found a better variety of outlets from which to create chances, with Pedro Neto leading the way (10 chances created in five games) ahead of Palmer, Enzo Fernandez and Marc Cucarella. The defense has also improved its ability to slow opponents in the final third, with only five teams conceding fewer shots per game than Chelsea's 7.6 clip.

They've also come to embrace the art of the short corner, with far more than double the next team's usage of the approach. With two teammates joining the corner-kick taker in close proximity, Chelsea dares opponents to sacrifice its defensive presence in the box and instead commit numbers to preventing a cross. It's a safe approach that offers a variety of successful outcomes, whether it's creating the usual lobbed chance from such routines or regaining a possessive sequence from a scenario that seldom sees the ball stay in a taking team's custody for long.

Overall, it's been an impressive summer as Chelsea heads into its second season under Maresca. The 2021 Club World Cup champion has set itself up well to potentially return to the final in this expanded format.

2. Real Madrid (up 1)

After a difficult 2024-25, this tournament seemed like a prime opportunity for Real Madrid to implement Xabi Alonso's vision with (to scale) lesser expectations to win hardware. Of course, “rebuilding” is hardly part of the club's DNA, and even a Madrid team visibly learning on the fly is in its usual place among the contenders.

While Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen were instant insertions upon arriving from Liverpool and Bournemouth, respectively, the real lesson from these first five games has been the apparent first-team readiness of Gonzalo García. The 21-year-old was seen as a stopgap for this tournament as Madrid surveyed possible backups for Kylian Mbappé. However, García has rewarded his new manager's trust with some timely scoring in the group and quarterfinal alike, tying himself with Angel Di Maria and Marcos Leonardo with four goals. With both Benfica and Al Hilal eliminated, one more goal could be enough to give this tournament an unpredictable first Golden Boot winner.

The old guard is doing its part, too. Federico Valverde is still a class above in midfield and has been a hit on this side of the Atlantic, generating loud support from Uruguayans and Madrid fans alike. Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham are joint-team leaders with eight chances created apiece, while Courtois is a worthy front-runner for goalkeeper of the tournament.

The first five games have shown evidence of the hard work ahead for Alonso. His team plays almost too cleanly, with just 2.9 percent of their turnovers ending in fouls. It's the joint-lowest rate in the field, level with amateur side Auckland City, and one that may open Madrid up to too many counter attacks with which it can contend. As it stands, only two quarterfinalists allowed more shots per game than Madrid's 13.4. The end of their quarterfinal was far from comfortable, with Huijsen now set to miss the final and two conceded goals in extra time. As such, Madrid projects as the underdog in the stronger semifinal matchup.

Nonetheless, it's another major tournament with Madrid among the final four sides — a semblance of normalcy in such an unknown sort of competition.

1. Paris Saint-Germain

Coming into this summer, everyone in the field knew that PSG can attack. That's always been their stronger phase of play, at least since they began operating like a super club, hoping to pad a scoreline enough to overcome defensive shortcomings and some leaky goals in spite of often strong goalkeeping.

This summer, Luis Enrique's side has followed up its Champions League breakthrough by leaning even more into refining its improving defense. Through five games, PSG has arguably been the field's best defensive side. Only one team has conceded fewer shots per game (7.4), while only two teams allow a stingier xG per shot faced (0.076). The press has kept opponents from sustaining possession for long (a passes allowed per defensive action taken, or ‘PPDA', of 8.14) while only four teams are winning a greater share of loose balls (61.6 percent recovery rate).

Bayern fans will understandably rue Donnarumma for the rest of his career after the challenge that led to Jamal Musiala's gruesome injury. In terms of his shot-stopping, however, few goalkeepers have been more impactful in this tournament. Ousmane Dembele has looked impactful as ever since missing the group stage with injury, scoring from the bench against Bayern. Joao Neves and Achraf Hakimi have given opponents scoring threats to fear beyond the forward line, too.

All questions about their high-end capability, immediately after winning Europe, have been answered with a credible on-field balance. PSG could hardly have set itself up better to follow domestic and continental triumph with a global title to complete a famous treble (or, including Coupe de France, a quadruple).

FIFA Club World Cup

If the starting line-ups contain names such as Michael Olise, Jamal Musiala and Kingsley Coman on one side, with Bradley Barcola, Desire Doue and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia on the other, there is a high probability of entertainment.

Yet how both teams approach the game factors in whether we see the individual flair or not.

Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich didn't disappoint the audience on Saturday, with their proactive and positive approaches resulting in a thrilling match where Luis Enrique's side came out victorious.

PSG and Bayern played to the strengths of their forwards, focusing on isolating their wingers to get the best of their dribbling abilities. However, different methods were used to reach that target.

Luis Enrique's team wanted to shift Bayern's block towards one side of the pitch, by overloading that area, before switching the play quickly to put Barcola or Kvaratskhelia in an isolated situation.



In this example, Vitinha and Joao Neves are overloading the right side, which drags Joshua Kimmich and Aleksandar Pavlovic towards the touchline, with Bayern's right-back, Konrad Laimer, moving inside to mark Fabian Ruiz.

As Vitinha plays the ball to Fabian, Barcola attacks the space inside the pitch…



… and combines with the Spain midfielder, with Laimer completely out of position.

On the other side, Kvaratskhelia is free and calling for the pass…



… which Fabian plays in the space vacated by Laimer.

Meanwhile, Olise drops to cover for his right-back and intercepts the pass…



… but Kvaratskhelia wins the ball back. Doue then picks up the loose ball, but his shot misses the target.





Laimer's pressing role meant that if PSG could drag him out of position and switch the play in time, Kvaratskhelia would be in a one-versus-one situation against Dayot Upamecano.

Here, PSG are shifting the ball from the left side to the right to move Bayern's block, and Laimer is moving towards Fabian as Kimmich and Pavlovic are keeping an eye on Vitinha and Neves.



With Kimmich and Pavlovic in advanced positions, Achraf Hakimi plays the ball inside the pitch to find Barcola's run behind the midfield duo.



Once PSG penetrate Bayern's block, Laimer's pressing role becomes a liability because as he is marking Fabian in the centre of the pitch, Kvaratskhelia (out of shot) is in acres of space down the wing.

After Barcola receives Hakimi's pass, he dribbles inside…



… and switches the play to put Kvaratskhelia in a one-versus-one situation.



The Georgian dribbles past Upamecano with ease…



… but he is denied by a brilliant save from Manuel Neuer.



In another example, Vitinha, Neves and Fabian are near the left side of the pitch, and Willian Pacho immediately switches the play towards the right wing.



Barcola's immaculate first touch creates an isolated situation against Bayern's left-back, Josip Stanisic, because it allows him to control the ball before Kimmich and Pavlovic can shift across.



The right-winger then dribbles inside the pitch and drags Stanisic out of position, which allows PSG to combine and find Hakimi's third-man run.



The Morocco full-back then plays a low-curling ball across goal…



… but Kvaratskhelia only manages to hit the side-netting.



After the first-half cooling break, Vincent Kompany altered his side's pressing scheme by leaving the role of marking Fabian to Bayern's centre-backs, or Olise when PSG were building the attack on the other side.

By adjusting their pressing, Bayern stifled PSG's possession game and were able to have more time on the ball for the remaining hour.

Bayern's isolation method revolved around putting their full-backs in the half-spaces to create a direct passing lane into their wingers and prevent PSG from doubling up against them.



In this example, Laimer, who moved to left-back after Sacha Boey replaced Stanisic, plays the ball to Coman and attacks the space between Hakimi and Marquinhos.



Laimer's movement occupies Hakimi and creates a one-versus-one scenario for Coman, who dribbles past Neves twice…



… forcing PSG's right-back to change his focus and leave Laimer to Marquinhos.

This sequence of events means that Harry Kane has a bigger space to attack inside the penalty area if Bayern can find him with a cross. This happens when Coman dribbles past Neves again…



… and puts in a left-footed cross that the England striker heads over the bar.





In another example, Boey dashes forward in the right half-space to prevent Fabian from doubling up against Olise.



In the one-v-one, Olise wrong-foots Nuno Mendes and dribbles inside the pitch…



… but his shot is saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma.



Despite Bayern's control in the second half, PSG managed to take the lead through Doue in a transitional moment after Neves won the ball back in midfield.

Later in the game, Ousmane Dembele scored on another transition to make it 2-0 and seal PSG's place in the semi-finals of the Club World Cup.

PSG's goals reflected another part of the game that made it more exciting. Both teams were willing to press high up the pitch, counter-press when they lost possession and hit on the counter whenever there was an opportunity — all of this suited the match's most skilful players.

Tactics doesn't shackle individual talent, rather they empower it to help it flourish.

Bayern Munich's 22-year-old young superstar Jamal Musiala suffered a horrific leg injury at the end of the first half of the team's 2-0 Club World Cup quarterfinal loss to PSG Saturday in Atlanta. The Germany international, one of the most technical and prolific midfielders in the sport, went after a loose ball in the attacking box just as PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma committed to playing it. The Italian goalkeeper dove for the ball and landed on Musiala's left leg. When the play cleared up, his left ankle could be clearly seen dangling to the side. 

Bayern players quickly alerted the goalkeeper to stop playing so that the player could be tended to. Numerous teammates surrounded him and put their hands over their heads in disbelief at the severity of the injury. The referee quickly signaled for the medical team to bring a stretcher out on the field as the teams went into the tunnel for halftime and Musiala received medical treatment.

Musiala was taken to the hospital.

"For me, this isn't a result of constant playing," Bayern sporting director Max Eberl said after the game, according to ESPN. "It is more of an accident, it happened, and this is obviously bad for us."

"It didn't look good," Bayern head coach Vincent Kompany said. "If I'm just watching the images, it looked like an ankle injury of some kind, but I'm not going to make a diagnosis here."

On Monday Bayern confirmed that their attacker had broken his fibula.

PSG managed to get the winning goal in the 78th minute via a low shot from Desire Doue, yet it was far from smooth sailing the rest of the way. PSG got two red cards, with Willian Pacho (bad tackle) and Lucas Hernandez (elbow to face) both being booted from the match. Despite the two-man advantage, Bayern could not find the equalizer as Ousmane Dembele put home PSG's second in the sixth minute of added time. 

With the win, PSG will face Real Madrid in the semifinals next week. 

Musiala was the Germany national team player of the year last year. He debuted for Bayen at age 17 and became the first teenage to play for Germany at the World Cup since 1958. He's widely expected to become one of the world's very best players in the coming years.

We are edging towards the conclusion of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, with just four sides remaining in the revamped 32-team tournament. 

The quarterfinals produced a staggering amount of drama, especially on the right side of the draw as Paris Saint-Germain faced Bayern Munich and Real Madrid dueled Borussia Dortmund in repeats of recent UEFA Champions League finals. It was the French and Spanish giants who triumphed over their German opponents. 

They have earned their place in the semifinal, as have Chelsea after their victory over Palmeiras. The Blues are on the easier side of the draw and will have to overcome Brazilian adversaries again in the last four as they prepare for a mighty battle with Fluminense. 

Here's a look at the FIFA Club World Cup bracket ahead of the semifinals.

An epic all-European clash and an upstart Brazilian side takes on London's finest in the final four.

Three European teams and one from South America have their sights set on the FIFA Club World Cup (CWC) 2025 trophy as the tournament enters the semifinal stage on Tuesday.

The final two clubs qualified for the final four on Saturday. UEFA Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) spectacularly defeated Bayern Munich 2-0 in the quarterfinals despite being reduced to nine men. Five-time CWC winners Real Madrid played out a five-goal thriller to beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2 to seal their semifinal spot.

Here's how the Club World Cup semifinals line up:

When: Tuesday at 3pm (19:00 GMT)
Where: MetLife Stadium, New Jersey

The opening semifinal pitches Brazil's Fluminense against English Premier League side Chelsea.

Fluminense continue to impress at the CWC with goals from Matheus Martinelli and Hercules securing their place in the last four with a 2-1 win against Al Hilal in Orlando, Florida.

Chelsea scored the go-ahead goal on Malo Gusto's 83rd-minute shot, which went in after a pair of deflections, beating Palmeiras 2-1 on Friday night to secure their spot in the semifinals.

Cole Palmer put Chelsea ahead in the 16th minute, but Estevao, an 18-year-old who will transfer to Chelsea after the CWC, tied the score against his future club in the 53rd. Gusto's match-winning shot after a short corner kick that appeared to deflect off defender Agustin Giay and goalkeeper Weverton sent the Chelsea fans among the 65,782 spectators into a frenzy.

The match will take place at the 88,000-seat MetLife Stadium just outside New York City.

When: Wednesday at 3pm (19:00 GMT)
Where: MetLife Stadium, New Jersey

The second semifinal features a mouthwatering European heavyweight matchup between PSG and Real Madrid.

Nine-man Paris Saint-Germain advanced after defeating Bayern Munich 2-0 with goals from Desire Doue and Ousmane Dembele keeping the French side on track to achieve a historic quadruple of major titles in one season.

Luis Enrique's side needed to dig deep in front of 67,000 fans at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, after late red cards for Willian Pacho and Lucas Hernandez.

Meanwhile, Gonzalo Garcia scored his fourth goal of the Club World Cup and Kylian Mbappe his first as Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2 in the final quarterfinal on Saturday.

Garcia put Madrid ahead from close range early on during a hot afternoon at the MetLife Stadium, and Fran Garcia then doubled their lead before the midway point.

Dortmund never seriously threatened a comeback before a remarkable late flurry of activity with Maximilian Beier pulling one back in the 93rd minute and superstar forward Mbappe registering Madrid's third goal with a stunning overhead kick.

Mbappe, who has battled illness for most of the CWC, will face his previous club PSG for the first time since he departed the Paris-based side for Real Madrid in June 2024.

The final will be played on Sunday at the MetLife Stadium, which will also the venue for the 2026 FIFA World Cup final.

The winning team in the Club World Cup could pocket as much as $125m in prize money.

Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly called on Al-Nassr to challenge Arsenal in a summer transfer raid on Real Madrid for Rodrygo.

The Gunners are generating plenty of speculation when it comes to Brazil international wingers. Gabriel Martinelli is seeing a big-money move away from Emirates Stadium speculated on - with Al-Nassr said to have an €85 million (£73m/$100m) bid on the table.

The Gunners are willing to do business there as they need to raise the funds that will allow a formal approach for Samba star Rodrygo to be made. Real Madrid are said to have placed a £70m ($96m) price tag around the South American's neck.

According to Sky Sports, Ronaldo has urged Al-Nassr to shelve interest in Martinelli and join the fight for Rodrygo. He considers the 24-year-old forward to be a better option for the Saudi Pro League outfit.

Portuguese GOAT Ronaldo has signed a new two-year contract with Al-Nassr on record-breaking terms. He wants to see new boss Jorge Jesus bring in players that can help him to win elusive major silverware in the Middle East.

Rodrygo appears likely to leave Madrid during the summer transfer window, having struggled for minutes under Xabi Alonso at the FIFA Club World Cup, but questions are being asked of whether he - like Martinelli - would want to leave Europe for Saudi Arabia at this stage of his career.

Ethan Nwaneri has reportedly delivered a contract ultimatum to Arsenal, with the teenage wonderkid yet to sign fresh terms.

At 18 years of age, England U21 international Nwaneri is considered to be one of the hottest prospects in world football. He recently helped the Young Lions to European Championship glory and took in 37 appearances for the Gunners last season - scoring nine goals.

Arsenal are understandably keen to put a new deal in place with another product of their famed academy system. Nwaneri has entered the final 12 months of his current contract at Emirates Stadium.

The Premier League's youngest debutant, who made his top-flight bow in September 2022 at 15 years of age, is attracting interest from leading clubs across Europe. Chelsea are said to be keeping a close eye on his situation at London rivals.


The Blues are being given hope of potentially pulling off a stunning coup as, according to talkSPORT, Nwaneri is “reluctant to sign a new deal at Arsenal without guaranteed playing time” - with his ongoing development requiring regular outings.

The youngster is currently competing with the likes of Bukayo Saka, Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli for minutes on the flanks, while Arsenal are being linked with a raid on Chelsea for England international Noni Madueke.

Nwaneri has revealed that challenging for the Ballon d'Or forms part of his future plans, and a starting berth will have to be nailed down somewhere if he is to land a Golden Ball. Arsenal need to convince a home-grown star that he can fulfil his ambition on their books.

It all comes down to this.

It's the United States Men's National Team versus Mexico in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup Final.

The USMNT took care of business with a 2-1 win over Guatemala in the semifinals, with midfielder Diego Luna scoring two goals in the opening 15 minutes of the game on Wednesday night.

In the other semifinal, Mexico forward Raul Jimenez scored the lone goal in the 50th minute in a 1-0 win over Honduras to advance to the title game.

This is the first meeting between the two bordering countries since Oct. 15, 2024, when Mexico defeated the United States 2-0 in an international friendly It was the USMNT's first loss against Mexico since 2019.

There should be no surprise here that it'll either be the United States or Mexico crowned as champions.

Since the Concacaf Gold Cup was established in 1991, either the U.S. or Mexico has won 16 of the 17 bi-annual tournaments. The lone exception was Canada in 2000.

Will USMNT claim their first Gold Cup trophy since 2021 or will Mexico win the tournament for a second consecutive time?

Here's everything you need to know on how to watch the Concacaf Gold Cup Final between USMNT and Mexico on Sunday night:

Mauricio Pochettino has lost five of his 15 games in charge of the US

Mauricio Pochettino's start to life as head coach of the United States men's national team has not been as convincing as he and the fans would have liked, but a promising run in this summer's Gold Cup might have begun to turn things around.

A win against Mexico in Sunday's final would deliver a trophy and start the process of instilling some much-needed belief.

It's a victory that Pochettino and his players need if they are to demonstrate that things are moving in the right direction before a World Cup on home soil next summer.

By now, the US should have some clarity in their preparations for the 2026 tournament, but there remains an unfinished, rocky feel to the foundations they have been laying since Pochettino took over in September 2024.

Questions were being asked of the former Tottenham Hotspur and Paris St-Germain boss following consecutive defeats by Panama and Canada in the Nations League finals, and Turkey and Switzerland in Gold Cup warm-up games.

Though they were only friendlies, those last two losses had USMNT (United States Men's National Team) fans worried.

These games, more so than those against regional opponents, are seen as the type of test they will face in the World Cup - and they failed both.

With the big tournament less than a year away and only one more competitive game to play, it can be easy to slip into a last-minute panic.

There has been a lack of consistency in both personnel and results. The squad appears unresolved, with the group of players called up differing for each camp, something that has mostly been beyond Pochettino's control.

Fifty-five players have made appearances for the USA under the Argentine since he was appointed 10 months ago, making it difficult to build momentum and togetherness.

Mixed results across those 15 matches have reflected this inconsistency and during this time, they are yet to claim victory against a team in the top 30 of Fifa's rankings.

Goalkeeper Matt Freese and forward Malik Tillman have impressed during the United States' run to the final

The Gold Cup is Concacaf's Euros and Copa America equivalent. Sunday's final against Mexico is the United States' last competitive match before the World Cup, which explains the sense of urgency going into it.

Pochettino's side have experienced a promising campaign despite missing some key players. Their presence in the final reflects that progress.

It has been a bonding experience for the players involved, but it's likely the XI that starts their first World Cup game in Inglewood next June will look significantly different.

Due to a combination of injury, the Club World Cup and fatigue, this current squad is without familiar names such as Fulham's Antonee Robinson, Juventus pair Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah, AC Milan duo Yunus Musah and Christian Pulisic and Monaco striker Folarin Balogun.

Star man Pulisic's decision to rest this summer rather than take part in the Gold Cup was particularly controversial given the context of building for next year's home World Cup.

The players Pochettino has been able to call upon have developed into a useful unit as the tournament has progressed and it's the most together and determined a US group has looked since he took over.

He might wish this togetherness could have been created with his first-choice group but, on the other hand, it has given him a good chance to test fringe players in a competitive, high-pressure environment with a trophy on the line.

Some of this contingent have made a good case for inclusion in next summer's 26-man squad.

Diego Luna has long been touted as a player with the potential to offer the United States something they've been missing. The 21-year-old energetic playmaker, who plays his club football for Real Salt Lake in MLS, has come into his own in the Gold Cup as one of this team's star players.

In goal, Matt Freese, of Manchester City's US relative New York City, has been given the nod ahead of Nottingham Forest's Matt Turner all tournament and, bar one mistake against Haiti, has pushed for inclusion at the World Cup.

Freese's penalty shootout heroics in the quarter-final against Costa Rica gave him a tournament highlight, doing his chances of a 2026 call-up no harm at all.

Elsewhere, midfielder Jack McGlynn, who was also eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland, has showcased his talent on the international stage, Bayer Leverkusen-linked Malik Tillman has impressed in a role just off the striker, and Crystal Palace defender Chris Richards has strengthened his claim for a starting centre-back role.

Regardless of what happens against Mexico, this Gold Cup has been a useful experience and a productive exercise - but there's an argument it needed to be more.

Sooner rather than later, Pochettino needs to turn this work in progress into a fully prepared first-choice team.

If the Club World Cup is a World Cup warm-up for the US in an organisational sense, the Gold Cup is a warm-up for what they will look like as a host nation in terms of how its team plays and how it is supported.

Research from renowned US outlet Soccer America revealed that group-stage attendances have dropped compared to recent editions but, though disappointing, this isn't necessarily a sign of things to come at the World Cup.

The clash with the Club World Cup, the absence of familiar stars and ticket pricing issues across the game will have affected turnout but the semi-final in St Louis against Guatemala was sold out.

Guatemala had plenty of support too and at times it felt like it was their home game. Pochettino, 53, believes they can serve as an example for US fans.

"[That] connection between the fans and the team, that is the connection that we'd like to see in the World Cup," he said. "That connection that makes you fly."

The United States doing well and encouraging sports fans to connect with its men's team during 2026 feels more important for US soccer than merely hosting the World Cup.

The Gold Cup has been something of a tonic for Pochettino and the USMNT but the Mexico game is a similar test to those they failed to pass against Turkey and Switzerland.

This moment cares not for the profile of the competition nor the strength of the squad available to Pochettino. It cares about lifting the trophy.

Win, and they'll have met expectations in an impressively resolute fashion while missing some familiar stars. Lose, and the pre-World Cup panic will return.

...

HOUSTON — The Luna family would gather whenever fútbol called them, but especially, invariably, for occasions like this one. Roughly once per year, parents, siblings and others would assemble around a TV for a soccer game that, as the youngest son now says, is “in my blood.” The U.S. and Mexico men's national teams would meet in Ohio or Mexico City, in Chicago or Pasadena. And back in Sunnyvale, California, the Lunas, like thousands of Mexican American families, would cook up hamburgers or enchiladas; don their favorite jerseys; and cheer or cry through a rivalry that divides and unites.

So they would surely gather again on Sunday (7 p.m. ET, Fox/Univision), for the eighth Gold Cup final between the two North American neighbors if not for an extraordinary twist: That youngest son, Diego Luna, will be playing.

Diego, 21, has clawed his way toward the core of the USMNT. With nose fractured or intact, with hair bleached blonde or hat backward, he has become the humble, gritty, tattooed, mustachioed face of the national team's rebuild. He soared into a new stratosphere of fame with two goals in a semifinal win over Guatemala. Now, he is “super excited” to walk into NRG Stadium and “play a game that I've dreamt of as a little kid.”

And he's emotional.

“That's just part of being human, right?” he said Saturday. “You're gonna have these emotions. It's how you grew up. It's part of your family. It's in your blood.”

But no, he is not conflicted. Many immigrants and children of immigrants feel attached to both teams when their adoptive country and their family's country meet in a soccer match. Diego never was.

His parents, who emigrated from Michoacán, Mexico, would celebrate El Tri goals. Little Diego would throw fits. “Half the family would be rooting for Mexico, half the family would be for USA,” he recalled. That led to “little comments” and intra-family “beef.”

Over time, he grew proud of his heritage. “I love being Mexican,” he told American Soccer Now in 2022. “But I grew up in the United States.” He could've represented either nation's soccer team. “It's only right to play for the country that raised me to who I am,” he said.

His commitment never seemed to waver, even when U.S. Olympic coaches snubbed him last summer. And even when, 15 minutes into his first start under USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino, a Costa Rican elbow broke his nose and bloodied him. Luna pleaded with coaches and doctors: Let me stay in. Mere moments after returning to the field, with his nostrils plugged, he delivered an assist.

"He showed great character,” Pochettino said afterward — and “big balls.” But it was more than just a viral moment. “That is what I want,” Pochettino said more recently. It's the “attitude, hunger, desire” that the head coach has begged for. And just as other, more prominent players seemed to lack those attributes, Luna showed, as Pochettino said, that “he is desperate to play for this shirt, for the national team.

“And that is why, now, he's [at] the level that he's showing.”

That, in many ways, is why Diego Luna is a professional soccer player at all. Born in the Bay Area and raised by a family that “[wasn't] the wealthiest,” he trekked down a circuitous path that, at times, he forged himself. He began under the tutelage of his father and older brother, with a ball at his feet five hours per day, often playing against boys who were two or three years older — and “bigger, faster, stronger.” Then, at 15, he left home.

He'd been feeling stuck at the San Jose Earthquakes academy. And school wasn't his thing. So he moved to Casa Grande, Arizona, where the Barça Residency Academy lives on a megacomplex of dorms, classrooms and fields in the middle of the desert. At first, he felt homesick. But he committed to the grind, and over time, his legend grew. His relentless creativity endeared him to peers. Youth national teams took notice.

Some scouts, though, were skeptical. They saw a positionless attacker with an atypically stocky, barrel-chested build. “There were a lot of doubters for Diego,” one of his youth coaches, Ged Quinn, told Backheeled. A torn meniscus also halted his progress. As his 18th birthday approached, many wondered whether he'd ever succeed against adults.

So, at 17, he set out to prove he could. He signed with the El Paso Locomotive, a second-tier club in the USL Championship. He recently explained the decision to Unfiltered Soccer: “When you go to MLS Next Pro [Major League Soccer's reserve division], you're gonna be playing against academy players, or guys that are young kids. When you go into USL Championship, that's a division of grown men. … Going into that environment, you're still competing against faster, stronger guys, and you're proving yourself.”

El Paso assumed he'd need time to adjust. Instead, within a couple months, Luna was starting. A year later, he was off to Real Salt Lake in MLS. That's where he pledged to become a two-way player; and developed into a senior national team prospect; and, perhaps most importantly, became a more well-rounded person.

Soon after moving to Utah, Luna crafted an old-school résumé, sent it to a local coffee shop, and interviewed for a position as … a barista. He'd go work his second job after training, less to make money, more to improve his interpersonal skills, which were lacking. He'd spent so much of his adolescence with his head down on soccer. He'd built a lifelong connection with the ball; he needed to learn how to build connections with people, via things like eye contact and conversation.

He also struggled mentally in his early years as a pro. And that, in 2024, is what led him to seek out a therapist. There was a lot going on in his life. (In addition to the demands of pro soccer and young adulthood, in September 2023, he became a father.) With the therapist, he worked on clearing his head — on “affirmations, breathing exercises, power poses … mindfulness, being present.” It was something “I struggled with a lot,” he told Apple TV. He wrote the affirmations and jotted down lessons in a notebook, which he could refer back to before games.

Less than a week after he started therapy, he scored his first goal of the 2024 season. Seven months later, he was MLS Young Player of the Year. Two months after that, he was in USMNT camp.

And in an otherwise meaningless B-team friendly against Costa Rica, he had a choice.

His nose was busted, and he “could take the easy way, and hop off.” Or, as he told Unfiltered Soccer, he could “grab [his] chance and go for it.”

Pochettino, Luna recently recounted, told him: “It's OK, you don't have to rush it, it's preseason.”

Luna asked for a chance to at least see out the first half. And he seized it.

He eventually departed at halftime, went to a hospital and underwent surgery. By the time he awoke, his family and agent were calling him “Big Balls,” and, still woozy, he initially panicked: Is my hospital gown loose? Then he learned of Pochettino's comment, and the meaning behind it. He later realized: Playing through the broken nose “might've been the best decision of my life.”

The entire experience, Luna said last month, “was life-changing.” It earned him an A-team call-up in March. And as the USMNT's stars slumped to two defeats, Luna was the one player Pochettino singled out in a positive light. “The desire and the hunger that he showed is what we want,” Pochettino said after a 2-1 loss to Canada. “When I told [him] today, ‘You are going to play,' he was red. … That is the example, for me, that we need to take.”

A couple months later, Luna was named to this Gold Cup roster. Reflecting on the January episode, he said: “I think it added an opportunity for me to come back into more camps and show the type of grit and the hunger that I have to play and represent for my country. Mauricio really liked that about me, and really liked the fight that I had. And I think that shows other players that that's what's needed in this team, to fight through everything.”

Whether that message has been received, Luna has continued fighting and sending it.

Playing as a left-sided attacking midfielder, with “confidence” and “comfort” and the freedom “to express myself,” he scored in a quarterfinal against Costa Rica, then twice in the semi against Guatemala. Afterward, Pochettino again raved: “Diego — that is all that we expect from a player.”

Luna himself spoke about “the grit” and “determination we've been lacking. … It's fighting to the end, every ball, every moment.” He spoke about the “honor” and “privilege” of playing in these games for the USMNT. He spoke about going into them “free,” with “mental space” and “mental clearness.”

And whereas some teammates struggled in a cauldron of Guatemalan noise, shook by the intensity of the crowd and semifinal opponent, Luna said: “I loved it. It was awesome, man. That's what every game should be like.”

He knows that the next one, Sunday's final, will be even more “hostile.” He also knows it will unearth emotions, “a lot of emotions” — emotions that, as the current U.S. roster's only Mexican American, will be unique to him.

He felt them Saturday. He assumes he'll feel them Sunday. But come midday, he said, “it's about locking in.” It is a massive occasion, personally and professionally, perhaps the biggest moment of his young career. But when clocks here in Houston strike 6:06 p.m., and 70,000 people roar, he will simply have to do what he always does: “I'm gonna give 100% for the jersey that I'm wearing.”

As the U.S. national team prepares to vie for a Gold Cup championship without him and several other regulars Sunday night against Mexico, polarizing young American and local product Gio Reyna did not get off the bench again in his supposed homecoming on Saturday. 

The 22-year-old Reyna did not play at all in his Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund's 3-2 knockout loss to La Liga powerhouse Real Madrid in the quarterfinals of the FIFA Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium. 

The talented midfielder logged only 12 minutes in Dortmund's five matches on U.S. soil this summer, and his limited usage could lead to a transfer in the coming months to benefit his development — especially with a crucial World Cup on the horizon in 2026 for the USMNT in North America after the hiring of head coach Mauricio Pochettino last September. 

Reyna's attitude issues and lack of playing time were controversial storylines at the previous World Cup in Qatar in 2022 under since-fired coach Gregg Berhalter, who publicly clashed with the young player's parents, including former national team captain Claudio Reyna. 

With Gio Reyna, Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and others not rostered during this CONCACAF window, the U.S. squad has relied upon and received intriguing production from several emerging players during its Gold Cup run. 

Diego Luna, Malik Tillman and Patrick Agyemang are among those building cases to play themselves into creative roles a year from now. 

Including Saturday's match, Reyna only saw action in Club World Cup play against South Korean club Ulsan Hyundai in the group round. 

Interestingly, Dortmund had used Reyna as part of its marketing campaign for its time in the U.S. 

There had been some thinking that Reyna might get on the pitch Saturday with Jobe Bellingham — whose brother Jude plays for Real Madrid — suspended for the quarters due to yellow-card accumulation. 

But Dortmund manager Niko Kovac did not use Reyna for the fourth time in five games, casting further doubt about his future with the German power. It would make sense for him to seek a transfer if he's not in the plans. 

Earlier this year, Reyna said in an interview with the FIFA website that he was “excited” about the possibility of playing near where he grew up.

“It's one of those stadiums that I've watched [games in] so much growing up that it's maybe going to be a little bit strange to actually be on the pitch there,” Reyna said of MetLife Stadium. “I'm very excited for me and, of course, all my family and friends in the area. 

“I'm going to have to get a lot of [tickets]. It should be fun and I'm really looking forward to it.” 

Kovac made three substitutions at the start of the second half, and another later on, but Reyna was not among them. 

“Gio is a player of Dortmund [for] four or five years,” Kovac said earlier in the tournament. “He is a part of my team at the moment. Gio is for sure a player who didn't play so much, but we know exactly his strengths, but we have top players here in the squad. 

“The confidence is very big, so hopefully every player can get minutes, but I can't promise you this is depending also on the results, also injuries, but my ambition is to give every player minutes. But this is always in relation to the results.”

More from Real Madrid's Trent Alexander-Arnold speaking to Dazn: "I still had a job to do to today - to try and perform for the team and help them win the game, no matter how difficult it was.

"As hard it was to do it, I had to push myself to focus on what my job and role was. I tried to do it as best as I could, but it was difficult and I am not going to lie about that. 

"[Diogo Jota] was one of my close friends. And I am sure that's what he would have wanted me to do. He was there with me today, I am sure."

Real Madrid's Trent Alexander-Arnold speaking to Dazn about his former Liverpool team-mate Diogo Jota, who died aged 28 in a car crash on Thursday: "He was a great friend of mine. It's been extremely difficult for me personally and also to everyone who knew him - not just his team-mates, friends or family, but everyone in the world of football. It's been very emotional and heart-warming to see the footballing world united and come together to show their love and support for him and his family and his brother as well.

"Although it's been difficult, it's also been a nice gesture from everyone. People united and showing love and support for what must be a mind-blowingly hard time for his family. I've been around him, his brother, his family, his amazing wife, his amazing parents and his amazing children. It's truly, truly heart-breaking to wake up to news like that. It's something you never expect.

"He was a very close friend, someone who lit up the room when he was in it. I shared the dressing room with him for five years. Amazing memories on and off the pitch. It goes without saying he will never be forgotten by anyone. He will live long in all our memories for the amazing man and the player he was."

Nizaar KinsellaBBC Sport football news reporter at MetLife Stadium

Real Madrid survived a dramatic added-time period, which featured three goals and a red card, to hold off Borussia Dortmund and qualify for the semi-final of the Club World Cup.

Gonzalo Garcia added his fourth goal in five matches after volleying in Arda Guler's pass in the 10th minute and Fran Garcia made it 2-0, tapping in Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross 10 minutes later.

Madrid were coasting to victory but substitute Maximilian Beier hit the first for Dortmund, sparking a frantic end to the game.

Substitute Kylian Mbappe scored an acrobatic volley shortly afterwards but defender Dean Huijsen was sent off for giving away a penalty just seconds later, after pulling back striker Serhou Guirassy, who then converted from the spot.

It was too late to change the outcome and the competition's breakout attacker Garcia put himself in pole position to win the Golden Boot at the Club World Cup.

He is level on four goals with Benfica's Angel di Maria and Al-Hilal's Marcos Leonardo, who have both now been eliminated from the competition.

Madrid next face Paris St-Germain at the same stadium on Wednesday (20:00 BST).

Borussia Dortmund

Borussia Dortmund head coach Niko Kovac speaking to DAZN: "Football sometimes is strange. In the first half, we didn't play well. We were passive. We were just waiting and not being aggressive enough. The second half was better from us but the save in the final minute was incredible. [Thibaut] Courtois is a world-class goalkeeper. 

"Real Madrid were so quick in attack. If you are too deep and you are too deep and you are too passive, this is not the best thing. We lost the game in the first half, not the second." 

On their Club World Cup campaign: "Overall, we achieved more than we expected. We played the quarter-final against Real Madrid and it's not a problem to lose against them. They are a world-class team. Now we go for the holidays - two or three weeks and then we start our engines again to prepare for the Bundesliga."

Andros TownsendFormer Tottenham midfielder on Dazn

I love Gonzalo Garcia's finish where he opens up his foot to put it in the
far post as opposed to putting it back to the near post. 

As he opens his foot,
he takes it away from the goalkeeper. It really is an expert finish. 

The fact
that at the last minute he has opened up his foot, he gave the keeper no chance.

Callum WilsonNewcastle striker speaking on Dazn

We aren't talking about him [Gonzalo Garcia] stepping in for one game and
turning up. He has done it game after game throughout the tournament. He is
nearly the top scorer in the tournament. 

It's not just goals he is bringing, he
is bringing work-rate, and he is helping them press. He deserves the respect
now.

Obviously Kylian Mbappe is a superstar but also, they may have a star in
the making. He just has to make sure he keeps getting opportunities and when he
does, he has to take them like he has.

“Overall, a good 80 minutes and the last 10 minutes we need

Rob GreenFormer England goalkeeper on Dazn

He has won the game for Real Madrid from nothing, Thibaut Courtois. He has barely touched the ball today. 

Niko Kovac can't believe it. Borussia Dortmund can't believe it. They were dead and buried minutes ago. But what a finale we have had here. 

Real Madrid 3-2 Borussia Dortmund

It is Paris St-Germain versus Real Madrid in a mouth-watering semi-final.

Real had looked in complete control at 2-0 up with goals from Gonzalo Garcia and Fran Garcia.

Maximilian Beier made it 2-1 in the second minute of injury-time, only for Kylian Mbappe to acrobatically volley in a third for Real.

But, in a frantic few moments, Dean Huijsen was sent off for Real when conceding a penalty, which Serhou Guirassy converted.

Dortmund almost snatched an equaliser in the 10th minute of added time through Marcel Sabitzer's shot on the turn, but Thibaut Courtois denied them.

Out of nowhere, Borussia Dortmund almost force extra-time. A shot on the turn comes in from Marcel Sabitzer and Thibaut Courtois gets his hand to it to stop it nestling in the bottom corner.

Dean Huijsen, who moved from Bournemouth last month, is deemed the last man and deemed to have not tried to play the ball. He walks and would miss a potential semi-final against Paris St-Germain.

Kylian Mbappe steals the show. He is one of the stars of this Real Madrid team in this tournament. 

It's a spectacular one from Mbappe. He had to wait just long enough and he knew exactly how to finish it. 

Dortmund asked a question and Real Madrid very quickly and firmly came with an answer. 

Garcia has been Real Madrid's breakout star at the Club World Cup having only played six games for the club before the competition

Real Madrid survived a dramatic period of injury time featuring three goals and a red card to beat Borussia Dortmund and reach the Club World Cup semi-finals.

The Spanish side looked to be heading towards a comfortable victory as they led 2-0 as the match reached 90 minutes.

Gonzalo Garcia had volleyed home his fourth goal in five matches on 10 minutes before Fran Garcia tapped in Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross 10 minutes later.

But substitute Maximilian Beier pulled a goal back in the second minute of injury time to spark an incredible end to the match.

Substitute Kylian Mbappe scored an acrobatic volley to re-establish Real's two-goal lead, but defender Dean Huijsen was then sent off for pulling down striker Serhou Guirassy, who converted from the penalty spot.

The late drama did not change the outcome, with Real reaching the semi-finals, where they will face Paris St-Germain on Wednesday.

Gonzalo Garcia will go into that game tied at the top of the golden boot standings with Angel di Maria and Marcos Leonardo - both of whom have been eliminated.

Garcia had only played six times for Real before this competition and scored just once.

But he has taken his chance in front of new manager Xabi Alonso, and started ahead of superstar Mbappe here.

Of course, Alonso may well have been rotating his team but Garcia has been involved in every match in the United States and is making his case to stay in the squad next season.

Garcia certainly stood out with his industry up front, chasing lost causes, linking well and taking his chances.

New signing Huijsen was assured at the back until his sending-off while Thibaut Courtois sensationally saved Marcel Sabitzer's volley, which was the last kick of the match.

Dortmund were largely outclassed but Julian Brandt was a threat both in terms of almost scoring himself and in trying to create for others.

Madrid qualify for the Club World Cup semi-final and will face Paris St-Germain at MetLife Stadium on Wednesday (20:00 BST). 

Dortmund restart their domestic football in mid-August with a game against Essen.

...

Rúben Neves and João Cancelo flew to Portugal following Al Hilal's 2-1 defeat to Fluminense in the Club World Cup quarterfinals for the funeral of former teammate Diogo Jota. Neves served as a pallbearer for his close friend who died in a car crash with his brother André Silva in Spain on Thursday.

Jota was 28 years old, Silva was 26.

Prior to the match with Fluminense, Neves posted a tribute to Jota on social media.

"Wherever you are, I know you're going to read this, we've never been one for this sort of thing and maybe now I'll regret it a little," Neves wrote on an Instagram post. "But you know what you mean to me just as much as I know what I am to you."

"When I go to the national team, you'll still be by my side at the dinner table, on the bus, on the plane... you'll always be there with me, as usual," he continued. "We'll keep laughing, making plans, sharing our lives with each other. I'll make sure you're always there and I'll make sure your family never lacks anything while you're there, far away but thinking of us, waiting for us..."

During a moment of silence before the Club World Cup match began, Neves and Cancelo broke down with emotion for their former teammate.

Players and staff from Liverpool, for whom Jota played in the Premier League, also traveled to Portugal for the funeral. Among those in attendance were captain Virgil van Dijk and manager Arne Slot.

Jota originally joined Liverpool in 2020, scoring 47 goals with 15 assists in his 79 starts with the team, which won the Premier League title for the 2024-25 season.

Jota's death inspired tributes throughout the world on Friday. During Chelsea's Club World Cup match with Palmeiras, Jota's Portugal teammate Pedro Neto brought a jersey with the names Diogo and André onto the pitch.

Portuguese tennis players Nuno Borges and Francisco Cabral wore black ribbons during their matches at Wimbledon on Friday, as the All-England Club relaxed its all-white dress code to allow the players to pay tribute.

At the first show of their reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales, the rock band Oasis had an image of Jota in his Liverpool jersey projected behind the stage.

The cause of the crash that killed Jota and Silva is still ongoing. Police do not know who was driving the car and whether or not a blown tire caused the crash. The vehicle, a Lamborghini, was in flames when firefighters arrived on the scene.

The Spanish Civil Guard later confirmed to the Associated Press that Jota and Silva were killed in the crash, and their bodies were returned to Portugal for the funeral.

Cam Norrie and Sonay Kartal are the only British hopes left standing at Wimbledon after an emotional exit for Emma Raducanu. Norrie will be back on his favourite stage, Court 1, to face qualifier Nicolas Jarry today. Meanwhile, Kartal makes her Centre Court debut against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

The seeds have continued to tumble elsewhere. But Carlos Alcaraz came through another tricky tie against German player Jan-Lennard Struff on Friday to set up a clash with Andrey Rublev in the last-16, last up on Centre Court. There is no blazing sunshine scheduled for the weekend, but with the record temperatures expected to be replaced by clouds, the rain should hold off.

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, fifth seed Taylor Fritz, and Queen's finalist Amanda Anisimova are also in action on day seven of Wimbledon.

Wimbledon chiefs have conducted an investigation into a controversial incident during Sonay Kartal's defeat to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova which involved the new Electronic Line Calling (ELC) system.

A spokesperson for the All England Club has confirmed that apologies have been issued to Kartal and Pavlyuchenkova, and that the ELC system was not functioning correctly for only one game during their match because it had accidentally been deactivated.

The statement began: "We have had the opportunity to undertake further investigation, including speaking to the players, Chair Umpire, Hawk-Eye operators and Review Official. It is now clear that the live ELC system, which was working optimally, was deactivated in error on part of the server's side of the court for one game by those operating the system.

"In that time there were three calls not picked up by live ELC on the affected part of the court. Two of these were called by the Chair Umpire, who was not made aware that the system had been deactivated.

"Following the third, the Chair Umpire stopped the match and consulted with the Review Official. It was determined that the point should be replayed. The Chair Umpire followed the established process. We have apologised to the players involved.

"We continue to have full confidence in the accuracy of the ball tracking technology. The live ELC system relies on the Hawk-Eye operators, the Review Official and the technology to work in harmony. This did not happen. In this instance there was a human error and as a consequence we have fully reviewed our processes and made the appropriate changes."

Carlos Alcaraz will face Cameron Norrie in the quarter-finals.

The Spaniard has beaten Andrey Rublev 6-7 6-3 6-4 6-4.



Carlos Alcaraz gets the first break in the fourth set and is on the home stretch. He leads 4-2.

Carlos Alcaraz gets the only break of the third set and now leads Andrey Rublev 5-6 6-4 6-4.

Amanda Anisimova has taken the first set against Linda Noskova 6-2 on Court 1.

The No.13 seed has one foot in the quarter-finals.

We've reached a crucial point in Carlos Alcaraz's clash with Andrey Rublev.

They're tied 3-3 in the third set, having taken a set each.



Injured Wimbledon star Jordan Thompson has admitted he 'feels like a p***y' for retiring from his match against Taylor Fritz on Sunday.

And he is now '95 per cent sure' that he will not be in any fit state to compete in the next round of the men's doubles with Pierre-Hugues Herbert.

The 31-year-old has been grappling with a back issue throughout the tournament, and at 6-1 3-0 down it proved too much to bear as he conceded defeat to Fritz after only 41 minutes.

As Thompson disappeared back to the locker rooms, Fritz told the crowd in his on-court interview: "Jordan's been battling out here, playing five-setters, I respect him for coming out, he was valiant. I feel bad for him and I hope he gets better."

But the Aussie was hard on himself during his post-match media duties, saying: "Honestly, I feel like a bit of a p***y pulling out. I wouldn't call it valiant."

Carlos Alcaraz was in trouble when he dropped a tight first set 7-6(5) to Andrey Rublev on Centre Court.

But the two-time defending champion has levelled the score after taking the second 6-3.

Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry got heated with Cameron Norrie as they shook hands after their five-set battle.

Jarry took issue with the Brit's behaviour during the match and confronted the umpire about it. But Norrie came out on top, winning 6-3 7-6 6-7 6-7 6-3.

The British No. 3 then told the Court 1 crowd: "He said I was a little bit vocal and I think that's my energy. I was pulling from my team and then I just said 'man, you competed so well and hung in there so well and it was an amazing competitive match'."

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka found herself playing against the crowd on Friday night when she beat Emma Raducanu in front of a packed Centre Court.

But British tennis fans quickly fell in love with the three-time Major winner, and she felt the support during her straight-set win over Elise Mertens on Sunday.

Sabalenka said: "Yeah, I mean, today I definitely felt all the support. It was so amazing playing and feeling the support. I didn't have to pretend that they were cheering for me because they were really cheering for me.

"I mean, what can be better than that? I really enjoyed that. I really hope that it can stay the same all the way, and they going to help me energy-wise to stay strong and to face all of the challenges."



There was frostiness between Cameron Norrie and Nicolas Jarry immediately after their match on Court 1.

Norrie surrendered a two-set lead as the gripping showdown went all the way to a decider, which the home favourite won before collapsing onto the Court 1 turf.

Jarry, who complained to the chair umpire about Norrie hesitating before serving earlier in the contest, seemed to be irked by the lengthy celebration as he did not wait for his opponent at the net.

Instead, Norrie shook the umpire's hand before going over to Jarry's seat and forcing the handshake himself. A few choice words were exchanged amid boos from the watching crowd, before they ended with a pat on the shoulder and a final handshake.



It took five sets of hard graft, but Cameron Norrie is into the Wimbledon quarter-finals for the second time in his career.

After Sonay Kartal's defeat earlier on, Norrie is the last Brit standing in the men's or women's draw.

He went tow sets up against big-serving giant Nicolas Jarry before losing tiebreaks in sets three and four.

The ultra-fit Norrie then found the extra gear he needed to get it done in the fifth.

His reward: a mouth-watering showdown with Carlos Alcaraz or Andrey Rublev.

Could we be in for a shock here on Centre Court?

Andrey Ruvlev takes the first set tiebreak 7-5 against Carlos Alcaraz.



Never mind... Carlos Alcaraz broke back three games later after a flurry of errors from Andrey Rublev and the Spaniard has now served to level the score at 4-4.

Two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz is on Centre Court for his fourth-round clash with Andrey Rublev.

The world No. 2 has just been broken to love, and Rublev leads 3-1 early doors.

Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova was fuming with the umpire for refusing to overrule the electronic line call during her win over Sonay Kartal.

"I think it's also difficult for him. He probably was scared to take such a big decision," Pavlyuchenkova said.

"I think they should. That's why they're there for sitting on the chair. That's why we have a chair umpire. Otherwise, I think soon let's just play without them, right, and then we're going to have everything automatic.

"I think we losing a little bit of the charm of actually having human being, ballboys. Like during COVID, we didn't have ballboys. It just becomes a little bit weird and, like, robot sort of orientated."



Nicolas Jarry has just forced a fifth and final set against Cameron Norrie on Court 1.

The Chilean dropped the first two sets and saved a match point in the third set but he's now levelled the score at 3-6 6-7(4) 7-6(7) 7-6(5).

Britain's Sonay Kartal will enjoy a well-deserved break after a career-best run at Wimbledon.

The world No. 51 reached the second week of a Major for the first time, losing to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Sunday.

Now, she's ready to relax before getting back on the hard courts.

She said: "I think that, yeah, this week I've proved to myself that I can go deep into Slams, I can beat some of the best players on tour.

"No, I think, listen, I'm going to go away with a lot of motivation. Yeah, I think I'll take a little rest, maybe a week or two off, just recharge, and get ready for the American swing."

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka is through to the quarter-final after beating friend and former doubles partner Elise Mertens 6-4 7-6(4).

Afterwards, she told the Centre Court crowd it was difficult to play against Mertens.

“It's tough to play against someone you know quite close and she's a great player great person and it's tricky facing her,” Sabalenka explained.

“Especially, I know how smart she is and I know that she's going to fight until the very end and she will be trying to find something and she really challenges me today, so it's tricky and tough, I'm really happy with the win.”



Nicolas Jarry has served an incredible 37 aces so far in this match.

In contrast, Norrie has seven. Jarry leds 3-2 in the fourth, but is 2-1 down on sets.

Sonay Kartal has spoken out after she and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova replayed a crucial point at 4-4 on the Russian's serve in the first set when the electronic line-calling system glitched.

The Brit appeared to send a backhand outside the lines but the call never came and the umpire stopped the point before telling them to replay it. Kartal went on to break and Pavlyuchenkova accused the official of "stealing" the game from her, though she stormed back to win 7-6(3) 6-4.

Kartal has now said: "That situation is a rarity. I don't think it's really ever happened, if it has. But no, it's tough luck. What can you do? The umpire is trying his best in that situation. I think he handled it fine."



It looked for all the world like Cameron Norrie would clinch the match there but Nicolas Jarry somehow stays alive.

You could have cut the tension with a knife inside Court 1 as the two players contested a gripping tiebreak.

Norrie spurned a match point and Jarry fluffed his first set point before converting at the second time of asking.

We go on.

Nicolas Jarry accused Cameron Norrie of disturbing him in an angry rant after the second set.

He felt the Brit was bouncing the ball too many times, then looked like he was going to serve before continuing to bounce the ball.

"It's something that he can control. It's not a nervous tick," Jarry fumed. "You think there's nothing I can do so I just have to suck it up, because he does it always.

"That's a reason for me to have to play with something that affects me. It can be changed, it's not something that cannot be changed."



No matter what happens from here, Cameron Norrie will go down as the last Brit standing in the men's or women's draw from this year's Championships.

Sonay Kartal lost her battle with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova earlier on, which means Norrie is the host nation's last remaining hope of having a quarter-finalist.

He's two sets up and in the driving seat.

Cameron Norrie won the first set 6-3 against Nicolas Jarry, and has now taken a second-set tie-break 7-4!

Britain's last hope is on course for the quarter-finals.



Sonay Kartal's dream Wimbledon run is over. The world No. 51 reached the second week of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in her career and made her Centre Court debut today to face Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

But the former world No. 11 and 2021 French Open finalist has shown that experience matters. Kartal served for the first set but Pavlyuchenkova wins 7-6(3) 6-4 in just over two hours.

It's still been a great run, and she will become the new British No. 2 after the tournament.

Remind you of anyone?

There was a huge cheer on Centre Court as Sonay Kartal survived a tough service game to stay hot on Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova's heels. From 40-15 up, Kartal was taken to two deuces but she held for 3-4.

The fans were right behind her as she had a half-chance up 15-30 on the Pavlychenkova serve. But Kartal is now serving to stay in the match down 3-5.

A mountain to climb here for Sonay Kartal. The British No. 3 was broken in the fifth game of this set, and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova has just held for a 4-2 lead.

Kartal's intensity is dropping after coming out on the losing end of a tight first set and the errors are coming.

She managed to get back on serve after going 0-1 down in the second set but the Russian is now widening the gap.

There are still promising signs from Kartal though, she sent a winner past her opponent before losing the game.

Cameron Norrie has won the first set 6-3 against Nicolas Jarry on Court 1.

The Brit raced through it in 31 minutes.



It had all gone a bit limp here inside Centre Court. Almost all of the sporting stars in the Royal Box vacated their seats to take a break after that nail-biting 77-minute first set, won by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

The world No. 50 then broke to start the second set and British hopes looked to be fading.

But Sonay Kartal won't go down without a fight - she's just broken again and the fans are back to whistling and cheering.



Mimi Xu rallied to win her first-round juniors match less than a week after making her Grand Slam main draw debut as a wildcard.

The Welsh 17-year-old got a free pass into the women's singles draw here and came up against countrywoman Emma Raducanu on Court 1, losing 6-3 6-3.

Back in the junior event, she came back to beat Thea Frodin 2-6 6-4 7-5.

Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova may have felt that the ninth game of the first set was “taken away” from her after an issue with the electronic line calling system. But the Russian has just taken the marathon first set over Sonay Kartal in a tiebreak.

Pavlyuchenkova went 3-0 up after taking two mini-breaks but Kartal got one back. They changed ends with the former French Open finalist leading 4-2, and she gave herself three set points at 6-3.

Kartal sent the ball wide to hand her opponent the set 7-6(3) after 77 minutes on the court. Work to do for the Brit in her first round-of-16 appearance at a Slam.

Sonay Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova have already been going for 70 minutes. And this set is going to a tiebreak.

It's been madness so far - there was an electronic line calling glitch, and then Kartal was broken serving for the set.

Plenty of drama under the roof here on Centre Court.

But play has resumed on the outside courts following an earlier thunderstorm.

Cameron Norrie vs Nicolas Jarry is also underway on Court 1.



Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova accused chair umpire Nico Helwerth of “taking the game away from her” at 4-4.

The Russian had game point when Kartal appeared to send the ball wide but a call never came. The umpire stopped the point to check whether the electronic system was working, then announced there had been a glitch and told the players to replay the point.

“I don't know if it's in or it's out. How do I know? How can you prove it? Because she is local, they can say whatever. You took the game away from me,” Pavlyuchenkova claimed.

Kartal managed to keep herself alive by winning it to get back to deuce, and then broke to lead 5-4 and serve for the first set. But former world No. 11 has broken back and we're level at 5-5.

Sonay Kartal survived a marathon service game at 3-4 and she's now broken again after a nightmare error with the electronic line-calling system. Centre Court has erupted as the British No. 3 takes a 5-4 lead - but the game was almost over.

Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova had a game point 4-4 and Kartal hit a ball that looked out but no automatic call came. The umpire stepped in and told the players to stop the point, then announced that he had to check whether the ELC system had been working on that point.

Fans inside Centre Court started booing and there was a three-minute delay before the official announced: “The electronic line calling system was unfortunately not able to track the last point so we will replay the last point.”

Kartal was able to keep herself in the game and then broke to serve for the set.



The first men's quarter-final is now set in stone, and Karen Khachanov will fight Taylor Fritz for a place in the semis.

Both men have had to contend with two five-setters en route to the last eight, but Fritz may go in slightly fresher after Jordan Thompson retired through injury during the second set of their fourth-round showdown today.

Khachanov, though, only needed three sets to beat Kamil Majchrzak.

All in all it promises be a tasty meeting between the American fifth seed (Fritz) and the Russian 17th seed (Khachanov).

Their match has been pencilled in for Tuesday.



Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova has just sent Sonay Kartal running from corner to corner around the baseline. The crowd were in awe as the Brit scampered around to chase down every ball.

But she couldn't get to a dropshot and the Russian has broken to draw level at 3-3.

Kartal's got her hands on her hips but there's not much she could've done.

Even Sonay Kartal is smiling at that one! The crowd erupted as she landed a volley winner perfectly on the line to take a 0-30 lead on Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova's serve. As she walked back to the baseline, she was grinning.

And she's just broken, reeling off three games in a row to lead 3-2 from 0-2 down. The atmosphere under this roof is electric - Kartal is about to blow it off.

It's all over on Court 1 as Jordan Thompson has retired from his match against Taylor Fritz.

The Aussie came into the tournament nursing a back injury but it's believed to be a right thigh injury which has ruled him out of carrying on here.

Fritz was comfortably ahead 6-1 3-0 when Thompson opted to call it a day after leaving the court for treatment earlier in the contest.

Having booked his spot in the quarter-finals, Fritz said: "It's obviously not the way I wanted to go through. I was excited to play some good tennis. It's just sad.

"He has been battling this week and his body is not right. I feel bad for him and I hope he gets better."

It doesn't take a genius to work this out if you've read the earlier updates, but all play on the outside courts is suspended.

Sonay Kartal has just broken back to love! The entire 15,000-strong Centre Court crowd got up and applauded as Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova failed to get the ball over the net, allowing Kartal to get back on serve.

Sonay Kartal has been broken. In her first-ever service game on Centre Court, the Brit struggled to land her first serves and made too many costly mistakes.

Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova took a 2-0 lead with a winner, but the fans here are trying to get behind the British No. 3.

Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova has just held serve in the first game on Centre Court.

It's Sonay Kartal's turn to serve now, and the 15,000 fans inside Centre Court give her a huge cheer as she wins the first point on her serve.

Outside, the torrential rain is battering against the court's roof, and you can barely hear the ball come off the players' rackets at times.

Jaume Munar was livid after a ball kid inadvertently interfered with a point during his third-round Wimbledon defeat.

Munar lost to Marin Cilic in four sets on Saturday, and the seemingly cramped conditions on Court 18 did not allow him to patrol the very back of the court without the ball kid getting in the way.

During one point, with Cilic serving to go 4-2 up in the fourth set, Munar scrambled to collect a shot out wide and made contact with a ball kid just before attempting a lob which landed out. Immediately afterwards, Munar angrily approached the chair umpire and asked for something to do be done.

"He [the ball kid] cannot move?" he asked. After the umpire informed him that nothing could be done so long as he was in his assigned position, Munar carried on: "So if I'm running and I hit him, I hit him and that's it? And we carry on? That's it? Not let, nothing? I just destroy him and that's it? I hit him with the racket [during the last point]!"



Yasmin heard that big boom from Centre Court, while here in the media centre we thought it was an earthquake!

It really was something else, with people taking their headphones off in shock.

Fans are cowering under every little bit of shelter as the rain buckets it down.

Sonay Kartal has just stepped out onto the Centre Court under the roof. There was a huge boom of thunder the moment she came out.

She's also got large strapping on her right knee - which she also had in practice this morning. Kartal had a small bit of tape under the knee in doubles yesterday but this is a lot more prominent.

There's a loud buzz under the roof as Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova warm up. It's about to get loud on here.



To Centre Court, where Sonay Kartal is about to take to Wimbledon's biggest stage for the first time.

There's some light drizzle outside so the roof is on, only adding to the atmosphere.

The sporting ceremony is currently underway as Clare Balding introduces the athletes in the Royal Box.

Though there has just been a huge clap of thunder outside...

The legends' doubles draws are out. Retired players return to Wimbledon to play in invitational men's, women's and mixed doubles events - and two-time men's singles champion Andy Murray would have had the option of signing up this year, but his name is nowhere to be seen.

Other Brits, including Johanna Konta, Laura Robson, and Greg Rusedski had entered.

The Bryan Brothers will also appear in the men's event, and Wimbledon legend Martina Navratilova is in the mixed.

Sonay Kartal is now just 30 minutes away from her Centre Court debut.

Here's the moment she arrived at SW19, greeted by British fans on the way in...

Sonay Kartal has vowed to get her 15th tattoo to comemorate her career-best run to the fourth round of Wimbledon.

The Brit is set to make her Centre Court debut in an hour when she faces Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for a place in the quarter-finals.

We took a look at all 14 pieces of ink that Kartal currently has tattooed on her body.



Cruz Hewitt, son of 2002 Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt, won his first ever match at the All England Club on Sunday morning.

The 16-year-old has entered the junior draw for the first time and he thrashed Savva Rybkin 6-1 6-2.

Hewitt started playing on the Challenger tour last August as he looks to follow in his dad's footsteps.



Iga Swiatek has again been put on the spot over admitting to taking towels home with her from Wimbledon.

After beating Danielle Collins on Saturday, she told the Tennis Channel: "Honestly, I take towels from everywhere, people just don't notice that,” she pleaded. “Here, it's suddenly a big thing, it's all a bit humiliating.

"The Wimbledon towels are of the best quality after you wash them. I use them daily in Warsaw, so I can recommend them.”

Dan Evans has warned Sonay Kartal that she will face tougher challenge than anybody is expecting this afternoon.

It is widely conceived that the Brit has a favourable draw and both should progress to the quarter-finals.

But Evans has warned that Kartal cannot underestimate her opponent Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who reached the quarter-finals here herself in 2016 - and the final of the French Open

"Looking ahead to Sunday, I was pretty bullish about Sonay and Cam's chances in my last column before the tournament and they have backed me up," Evans said.

"For Sonay, she probably feels like she should be a bit more… not respected, but more spoken about. People will probably think Sunday is a decent draw but I actually think it's very hard. Pavlyuchenkova's been playing good on the grass and is a former Grand Slam finalist.

"It's a tough match but Sonay has done great so far. It's a really special relationship she has with her coach Ben Reeves."

No. 10 seed Ben Shelton is back into the second week here after beating lucky loser Marton Fucsovics on Saturday evening.

After reaching the fourth round, the American was asked which players had a good tennis IQ, and he had to throw 20-time Major winner Roger Federer in there.

"I've talked to Roger a few times just about the game. What kind of stuck out to me is how simple he put it, how simple he thought about things. He's watching tennis all the time, no matter the level," he explained.

"One, the commitment to just the game and love for the game, seeing that all the time. Then the way that he was able to, like, simplify the game, dumb it down, not make it more complicated than it has to be, I thought was really impressive."

The 1994 Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez believes the time is right for her own charge, teenage star Mirra Andreeva to win at Wimbledon.

Asked about her favourite for the title with her host of seeds already out, the Spaniard told Boyle Sports: “In the women's draw, I have to go with Mirra. If Mirra doesn't win, I have to go with Aryna Sabalenka.“In the men's draw, I'll go with Carlos Alcaraz.”

Andreeva - who is coached by Martinez - plays Emma Navarro in the last-16 on Monday.



Fans not on the main courts may be worried about the forecast today.

The Met Office is predicting patchy periods of rain right up until 6pm today, with the heaviest showers due between 1pm and 3pm.

Umbrellas will be out at SW19.



According to Grosvenor Sport, he's 7/5 to win a third straight crown at SW19. Jannik Sinner comes next at 6/4.

Men's title odds: Carlos Alcaraz 7/5; Jannik Sinner 6/4; Novak Djokovic 22/5; Taylor Fritz 17/1; Alex De Minaur 45/1; Ben Shelton 66/1; Marin Cilic 80/1; Cameron Norrie 150/1.

Wimbledon star Ben Shelton was forced to defend his sister after she was jeered by the crowd on Court No.1 on Saturday.

Here's the moment the American jovially backed his sibling, who has been in the stands at Wimbledon this week for all his matches so far...

Ben Shelton after his win at Wimbledon \u201cMy sister\u2019s here. She\u2019s been here for every match I\u2019ve played. She\u2019s been the lucky charm.

Jelena Ostapenko bizarrely lifted her skirt in a row with the umpire on Court No.1 yesterday.

Ostapenko partnered Hsieh Su-wei for their second-round match against Marta Kostyuk and Elena-Gabriela Ruse, winning 5-7 6-2 6-2.

In the warm-up though, official Jamie Crowson appeared to enquire about her clothing, and she angrily threw her hands up and lifted her skirt to reveal green undershorts.

The 2017 French Open champion was proving she was adhering to the tournament's dress code.

Novak Djokovic was described "insane" by the player he beat in the third round yesterday.

Fellow Serbian Miomir Kecmanovic said after his straight sets defeat: "It was insane, it was difficult to win points even when serving well.

"One wonders what to do on the court when Novak plays at that level. I came into the match without fear and didn't put pressure on myself, but his level was very high. If he continues to play like this, I feel he can win 20 more Grand Slam titles."



After beating Danielle Collins yesterday, eighth seed Iga Swiatek claimed a diet of pasta and strawberries was fuelling her during Wimbledon.

She told a bemused Centre Court crowd: "I know, I know[it sounds strange, but you should try it, guys.

"Why is it such a big thing? Everybody should eat that. I think it's a Polish thing. I think, in summer, kids are eating it a lot. We have great strawberries in Poland, as well."

A peak TV audience of five million people watched Aryna Sabalenka beat Emma Raducanu at Wimbledon on Friday night.

Raducanu's Centre Court appearance attracted the third-highest peak for a non-final match in four years. Only her own fourth-round match with Lulu Sun last year, and Andy Murray v John Isner in 2022, ebttered it.

The BBC have confirmed there were also more than 1.2million requests on BBC iPlayer.

Alex Kay-Jelski, director of BBC Sport, said: "The Sabalenka v Raducanu match was one of those special moments that brought audiences to BBC Sport in their millions."



So our two remaining British hopes are in action today.

In the women's draw, Sonay Kartal is first on Centre Court against. Russian player Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Later on Court No.1, Cameron Norrie plays Frenchman Nicolas Jarry.

Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz, and Aryna Sabalenka are also in action.

The schedule for the show courts has been posted on social media by tennis journalist Michal Samulski...

Sunday schedule (singles only) #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/XDttnbh7hG

Andy Murray and Carlos Alcaraz's rivalry on the golf course amused the Centre Court crowd yesterday.

And now Murray has taken to social media to suggest it was him who won the rivalry.

“He beat me that day. He beat me in golf that day. But then a few days later, I beat him,” said Alcaraz when quizzed about losing to Murray in a pre-tournament match.

“So, it's 1-1. We are tied. We are tied. Will we play again? Let's see. I love playing golf on my days off. I know he has a busy schedule.

“I will try to set up a golf round again, nine holes, and we will see who wins. We are tied at 1-1. We have to play again, absolutely.”

And Murray has now tweeted to suggest the Brit leads their head-to-head 2-1...

We played the deciding match this afternoon. Maybe ask him what happened after the next match ???? https://t.co/SS6afDFs6I

And here's what we'll get from the women's day tomorrow and Monday.

Mirra Andreeva vs Emma Navarro is a very fun one.

Tomorrow we've got the final British women - Kartal - vs Pavlyuchenkova first up on Centre Court.

That's followed by Sabalenka vs Mertens, with Noskova vs Anisimova the final match on Court 1.

Court 2 sees Sierra face Siegemund in the second match.

The ladies' singles Round of 16 is set \ud83d\udd12#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/SmV51TD5su

Here's how we're lined up tomorrow and Monday in the men's draw.

Alex de Minaur vs Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner vs Grigor Dimitrov are the highlights.

Tomorrow we've got Rublev vs Alcaraz last on Centre Court, Fritz vs Thompson first on Court 1 followed by Jarry vs Norrie - the last British man left at Wimbledon.

Khachanov vs Majchrzak is also first on Court 2.

16 will become 8 ????The gentlemen's singles Round of 16 ⬇️#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/tlOZ3CEDan

Novak Djokovic has spoken out on THAT point in his win over Miomir Kecmanovic.

"It was kind of like an ecstasy, to be honest, in that moment," he explained. "Yeah, I was super, super happy. It came at a really important moment, as well.

"I think 4-3, deuce, long point. We both were running around each other, around the whole court. Then just that diving backhand volley down the line passing shot.

"Can't wait to see the highlight (smiling). Yeah, I was pumped for that one. Obviously I'm not diving as much on the courts. Obviously the only surface where you would dive is grass.

"But I'm not used to it as much. So these kind of unique, rare moments are really something you cherish.

"Of course, if you win a point like this in important moment is even better."

NOVAK. DJOKOVIC. SHOWTIME! \ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/SQzvUo1kEM

Mika Stojsavljevic, the No. 7 seed in the girls' singles draw and the junior US Open champion, has suffered a shock first-round exit in the junior draw here.

Stojsavljevic, 16, made her main draw debut in the women's singles event earlier this week as a wildcard but lost to 31st seed Ashlyn Krueger in round one.

She returned to the juniors but was stunned by Mia Pohankova. Stojsavljevic served for the first set but lost 7-6(4) 6-1.

The records are tumbling for Novak Djokovic.

As well as his 100th Wimbledon win, he also clinched his 51st Grand Slam bagel set during his win over Miomir Kecmanovic.

That has moved him ahead of Andre Agassi in the all-time men's list.

Here is how it now stands...

1. Novak Djokovic - 51

2. Andre Agassi - 50

3. Roger Federer - 46

4. Jimmy Connors - 44

5. Rafael Nadal - 44

Defending champion Barbora Krejcikova lost to 10th seed Emma Navarro in the third round on Saturday. The Czech star called the doctor and physio during the third set and had her blood pressure taken. She then cried at the back of the court after going 3-5 down in the decider, and Navarro won 2-6 6-3 6-4.

Krejcikova has now said: "All I can say that the first half of the match I was definitely enjoying myself on the court and I was feeling quite well. But then suddenly out of nowhere I just lost all my energy and I couldn't really gain it back.

"I mean, Emma was just fitter than me. Yeah, was having more energy, controlling the match at the end.

"Well, first of all, I thought that it was the food, that I ate too early. That's why I started with all the bananas and all the sugars and stuff inside. But I wasn't really feeling better, I was actually feeling worse and worse with the time, yeah, with the time on court.

"Yeah, it's very sad for me and very unfortunate."

Novak Djokovic's seven-year-old daughter Tara stole the show on Centre Court on Saturday evening.

The seven-time champion here made a statement as he breezed past countryman Miomir Kecmanovic 6-3 6-0 6-4, then celebrated by pumping his fists in multiple directions, as he did in the last two rounds.

The No. 6 seed then revealed that the unusual gesture was an inside joke with his two kids, letting Tara take centre stage from his box to demonstrate their special dance, which was broadcast on the big screens inside Centre Court.



Novak Djokovic gave a classy statement after recording his 100th Wimbledon win, becoming only the third player to reach that landmark after Roger Federer and Martina Navratilova.

The victory came against Miomir Kecmanovic on Saturday, and he made light of his fellow Serbian with a 6-3 6-0 6-4 scoreline.

"It's very historic, it sounds very nice," he said. "I'm very grateful and it's a privilege to be in the position that I am.

"I've said it many times, tennis made me who I am. It has given me incredible things in life that I can experience.

"I try not to take anything for granted, particularly at this age. I'm still going strong, still trying to compete with the young players and do some slides and some splits on the court and push myself to the limit."

Iga Swiatek caused a stir earlier today on Centre Court when she revealed that she eats pasta with strawberries.

And when she was quizzed about it after the match, the eigth seed claimed Poland had better strawberries than England, and then joked that she could get banned for the controversial comment.

“Honestly, I think Poland. Because we have better climate for strawberries, right? Now Wimbledon is probably going to ban me from answering these questions,” she smiled.

Emma Raducanu said the first thing she did after losing to Aryna Sabalenka on Friday was eat a KitKat in the locker room.

Now, the official Instagram account of the chocolate bar has sent the Brit a supportive message.

Alongside a picture of a statement which says "You deserve a break" is the caption: "What a performance @emmaraducanu! Love from your changing room break".

Raducanu commented with a heart emoji.



Emma Raducanu has taken to social media to share her thoughts after suffering a tight 7-6(6) 6-4 defeat to Aryna Sabalenka on Friday night.

The Brit led the world No. 1 by a break in both sets but just came up short. Last night, she fought back tears in her post-match press conference and said it was tough to see the positives.

But Raducanu has now slept on it and, on Instagram, she wrote: "Many feelings to compute but that was a mega night to have been part of. Thank you for the thrilling energy and atmosphere. good luck for the rest of the way @arynasabalenka."

Sabalenka has already responded. "You played incredibly good. I'm sure we gonna play big matches in the future," she commented.

Novak Djokovic takes the second set to love. He leads 6-3, 6-0 and it looks like a formality from here.

Hannah Klugman made her Grand Slam main draw debut here earlier week as a wildcard but lost her opening match to 29th seed Leylah Fernandez.

Aged 16, Klugman is a top junior player and reached the junior French Open final last month.

And she's back in business in the Wimbledon junior girls' draw, storming past Sol Ailin Larraya Guidi 6-4 6-0 in the first round on Court 12.

Novak Djokovic has turned it up a notch in this second set. He leads 4-0.



Momentum is fully with Novak Djokovic now. He's broken his opponent in the opening game of the second set and held serve to lead 2-0.

Former world No. 3 Grigor Dimitrov - who reached the semi-final here 11 years ago - is through to the second week to face top seed Jannik Sinner.

Dimitrov has been forced to retire injured from the last four Grand Slam tournaments, so his focus is on his own fitness, and he's not bothered about a showdown with the world No. 1.

The 19th seed said: “This particular match for me, with all due respect, I don't rate it as a ‘wow' match. It's just another day for me to perform, you know?

“As I said, it's been difficult six, seven months for me. I put a lot of work. I've struggled a lot. That match has meaning for myself more so than anything else.”

If the roof was closed on Centre Court it wouldn't be attached no more!

The fans are on their feet and Novak Djokovic is soaking in the adulation.

He has just won the point of the tournament, there is no doubt about it, diving to his left to hit a winner after a 14-shot rally where both players were drawn into the net.

And the following point he wins to break for a 5-3 lead.



Completely accidental as he tried to return a powerful Miomir Kecmanovic shot, but Novak Djokovic drew "ooo"s from the crowd as he sent the ball into the umpire's chair.

No malice in this one.

Novak Djokovic raced into the 40-love lead in the opening game and there was a feeling this could be a walk in the park for the 38-year-old.

But Miomir Kecmanovic has held his own and is now on serve, trailing 4-3.



Belinda Bencic had to miss Wimbledon last year, for good reason. She welcomed her first child, Bella, with her husband and coach Martin last April.

After returning to lower-level ITF events at the end of last year, Bencic has already picked up a WTA Tour title in 2025 and she's now into the second week of Wimbledon.

She said: "I think I have a great support of my husband and all my family to be able to do what I love still and to have some great years ahead of me.

"We are traveling with her. So far everything is going really good. We're enjoying ourselves. Sometimes I feel even more relaxed with a different perspective, you know, playing on the tournaments, maybe being more grateful that I'm able to play and to have these beautiful moments together."

Iga Swiatek has raised a few eyebrows by revealing her favourite meal after beating Danielle Collins.

The Pole called out her team for eating 'cheat meals' this week while she has to stick to a strict diet.

When asked what was in store for her this evening, she said: "I ate it as a kid, it's pasta with strawberries. You should try it guys. Pasta, strawberries and a little bit of yoghurt. It's just great."

Novak Djokovic and Miomir Kecmanovic have made their way onto Centre Court for the third and final match of the day here.

The 24-time Grand Slam champion has a 3-0 head-to-head record over his fellow Serb.

But after seeing Jannik Sinner blow away his opponent earlier today, can he make a similar statement?



No.10 seed Emma Navarro has explained how difficult it was to continue playing while Barbora Krejicova was crying on the other side of the net.

"It was really tough out here today. Neither of us played our best tennis. I know she was dealing with some injuries at times," Navarro said.

"I was dealing with whatever I was dealing with. It was really tough. I'm just so grateful to be playing here at Wimbledon and playing in front of you guys. I have to remind myself how special of an opportunity it is to be out here. It means the world to me. It's awesome to be here.

"It's really not easy (playing when Krejcikova was crying). Part of you is telling yourself to put a bunch of balls in the court and that's all you have to do. But she's an amazing player - injuries or no injuries.

"That's not good enough and then you trick yourself into taking too much off the ball and not playing the way you want to play. Not an easy challenge for sure."

Barbora Krejicova broke down in tears on court towards the end of her third set against Emma Navarro.

The defending champion took a moment at the back of the court to wipe away the tears before being knocked out with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 defeat.



In the end it's an easy win for Iga Swiatek as the eighth seed breezes into round four of Wimbledon.

She had Danielle Collins' number from start to finish and only needed 75 minutes to come away with a 6-2 6-3 victory.

Two breaks in the first and two more in the second saw off the American, who could not live with Swiatek's power and accuracy.

The BBC have announced that Emma Raducanu's brave defeat to Aryna Sabalenka on Friday night drew a peak audiance of five million viewers.

Raducanu's fourth-round loss to Lulu Sun last year surpassed that mark, as did Andy Murray's four-set defeat to John Isner here in the second round in 2022.

Alex Kay-Jelski, Director of BBC Sport, said: "Wimbledon has the ability to mesmerise the nation, and the Sabalenka vs Raducanu match was one of those special moments that brought audiences to BBC Sport in their millions.

"We're proud to make these iconic and unforgettable sporting moments available to everyone free-to-air across TV, radio and online and there's still plenty of drama to come in week two."

Iga Swiatek has stormed into a one-set lead over Danielle Collins on Centre Court.

The eighth seed took only 39 minutes to win it 6-2 after breaking Collins in successive service games at 2-1 and 4-1.

The underdog has been gritting her teeth and smiling her way through so far.

But with a couple of stumbles on the slippy grass, she has taken a bit of a beating - in more ways than one.

Defending champion Barbora Krejcikova took the first set 6-2 against No.10 seed Emma Navarro on Court 1.

But the American has now levelled proceedings, winning the second set 6-3.

We're heading to a decider...



It's the middle Saturday of Wimbledon and fans are enjoying a day out at the All England Club. It's absolutely heaving around the grounds.

Spectators gathered around the south stand entrance to Centre Court to catch a glimpse of the sporting icons who are in the Royal Box today.

And down by Court 7, where doubles veteran and multi-Grand Slam champion Pierre-Hugues Herbert has teamed up with Jordan Thompson, there's standstill foot traffic.

Carlos Alcaraz insists that the 'nightlife world' has nothing to do with him being less consistent than Jannik Sinner.

Former Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios has tipped Sinner to enjoy a more successful tennis career than Alcaraz because the Spaniard 'likes girls' and 'might party too much'.

There was more than a hint of a dig in Alcaraz's response as he claimed to be unmoved about eye-catching comments like those coming from Kyrgios.

"They're funny comments, which coming from him doesn't surprise me," said the five-time Grand Slam winner. "It's no secret that Jannik has fewer ups and downs than me. It's something I've been working on. It has nothing to do with the nightlife world."

Jannik Sinner said he was in a rush to get off Centre Court so he could watch the final qualifying session of the British Grand Prix.

The F1 fan said: "Yes I know the qualies is going on now.

"No [I'm not going to the race on Sunday], no I have to focus on this tournament. I will manage my practice sessions around the race.

"I might get off and see the last rounds but it's going to be exciting. Unfortunately it's the middle of Wimbledon so until now I couldn't make it which is good for me, it means I'm still here playing. I will enjoy."

Elena Rybakina, the 2022 champion here, is out. She has just lost 7-6(6), 6-3 to Clara Tauson on Court 2



Jannik Sinner rapidly wraps up the third set.

The top seed wins 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 in one hour and 55 minutes.

Jannik Sinner has put one foot into the fourth round.

He leads Pedro Martinez 6-1, 6-3 on Centre Court.



Wimbledon wonderkid Mirra Andreeva has an ominous message for her SW19 rivals.

The 18-year-old thrashed Hailey Baptiste - a player five years her senior - on Court 1 earlier today.

And she didn't drop a set in either of the two previous rounds.

As the seventh seeds eyes up the big prize, she believes that her standards are improving with each passing match.

"Before I played today I told myself, 'Just go out there and do something'," said Andreeva.

"I always expect something from myself but I always try to let myself go and enjoy. I feel with every match I play, my level is rising."

Tomorrow's order of play is out, and British No. 3 Sonay Kartal will be making her Centre Court debut!

Here is the schedule for the two biggest showcourts.

CENTRE COURT - 1.30pm start

Kartal vs Pavlyuchenkova

Sabalenka vs Mertens

Rublev vs Alcaraz

COURT 1 - 1pm START

Fritz vs Thompson

Jarry vs Norrie

Noskova vs Anisimova

The full Wimbledon order of play is here.

Pedro Martinez is still battling shoulder problems but he is somehow growing into this game on Centre Court.

At one point he was 0-5 down and serving at 76mph in the first set.

But a medical time-out seems to have done the trick.

He put one game on the board in a 1-6 first set, and he has held twice in the second set, which he currently leads 2-1.

All hope is not lost, then, even if his chances are still extremely remote.

After rain delayed play on the outdoor courts this morning, we finally have some singles winners.

No. 7 seed Mirra Andreeva - the highest seed left in this half of the draw - stormed past Hailey Baptiste 6-1 6-3 on Court 1, which has a roof.

Meanwhile, Liudmila Samsonova beat Daria Kasatkina 6-2 6-3 on Court 3.

Pedro Martinez has taken a medical time out on Centre Court while trailing Jannik Sinner 0-5.

The Spaniard's shoulder was already strapped up and it's causing him all sorts of trouble. He's struggling to serve - his slowest first serve today was 76mph.

They've only spent 20 minutes on court so far.



Chris Evert has hailed Emma Raducanu after she valiantly fought Aryna Sabalenka on Centre Court last night.

She told ESPN: "It was exciting, it was competitive. ER has had a rough, rough four years but she has found renewed purpose in her game. At the end we saw why Sabalenka is world No.1 - she can pull herself out of holes when she is losing. She deals so well with the pressure - she stayed calm throughout the whole match.

"She was ahead both sets - 4-2 and then 4-1 against the No.1 player int he world. That has got to give her confidence. And she didn't do anything bad to lose that match. She just played against the No.1 player who has that experience. Renewed purpose, renewed joy. She is on her way back. And she has a great coach too."

It's Sporting Saturday at Wimbledon, when British athletes are invited into the Royal Box to take in the action on Centre Court.

Ahead of the first match, Jannik Sinner vs Pedro Martinez, Clare Balding is paying tribute to the sportsmen and women inside the box in a special ceremony before play gets underway.

Andy Roddick, Sir Jason and Dame Laura Kenny, Fran Kirby, and Dame Denis Lewis are among those watching on today.



An official announcement has just been made over the tannoy here at Wimbledon that there will be no play until at least 1.30pm on the outside courts.

However, spectators were told that the weather is looking "optimistic" thereafter.



Britain's Billie Jean King Cup captain Anne Keothavong was impressed with Emma Raducanu's performance during her tight straight-set defeat to Aryna Sabalenka on Friday night.

Keothavong found herself questioning whether Raducanu could sustain her level against the world No. 1. But she's now backed the former US Open winner to return to the top of the game.

She told the BBC: "I do think if Emma can really take confidence, which I hope she will take confidence from this performance and continue to build, then I have no doubt that we'll see her at the top of the game in no time.

"There were times where I was wondering, ‘Gosh, this is so good, is she going to be able to sustain it?' For a lot of the time, for most this match, I think she surprised a lot of people that she was able to challenge the world No. 1 and live with her."

Novak Djokovic's former coach, Goran Ivanisevic, has tipped him to upset Jannik Sinner at Wimbledon this year.

Sinner has won their last four meetings but Djokovic boasts two victories in their only meetings at Wimbledon, in 2022 and 2023.

Carlos Alcaraz, the reigning double champion at SW19, is also firmly in the equation.

"I don't think anyone can beat Djokovic before the semis, and he's never lost to Sinner here," Ivanisevic told CLAY. "OK, Australian Open and Roland Garros, but here Novak's beaten him twice.

"In my view, Novak's the favourite, no matter how sentimental that sounds. Everyone says this is his last chance — I don't agree. Plus, he's the best grass-court player, experienced, he knows exactly what it takes here."

Umpire Arnaud Gabas looked terrified as he was hastily wheeled off Court 2 while still sat in his chair.

Rain began to fall while Clara Tauson held serve against Elena Rybakina to make the score 4-4 in the first set.

Gabas was wheeled backwards off the court in his 6ft 9in chair and it appeared to snag on something on the ground, causing him to jerk forwards.

He puffed out his cheekys after coming close to falling from the height.



Stefanos Tsitsipas has been told not to play tennis until he sorts out his problems on and off the court by coach Goran Ivanisevic.

Tsitsipas' trip to Wimbledon this year was as disastrous as it was short-lived, with the two-time Grand Slam finalist and former world No.3 retiring after two sets of his first-round match against Valentin Royer.

Ivanisevic told CLAY: "I told him not to play tennis right now. He needs to fix his back and get physically fit because physically he's a disaster. I can't understand how a player of his level can be so unfit. After that, he can think about playing tennis again."

He added: "I didn't expect him to do well. His situation is clear: if he changes certain things on the court, and above all off the court, he'll be fine. But if he doesn't manage to change those things, then he doesn't have a chance."

Play has been suspended on the outside courts due to rain.

The players were initially held on the court to see whether the drizzle would pass but the matches were soon halted and players raced off court.

Over on Court 2, where Elena Rybakina was locked at 4-4 in the first set against Clara Tauson, the umpire was wheeled off in his chair so the ball kids could get the covers on quickly.



No. 8 seed Iga Swiatek will be hoping to get revenge over Danielle Collins when they meet in the second match on Centre Court today.

Collins stunned Swiatek in the third round of the Italian Open jsut a few weeks ago, where the Pole was defending the title. As a result, Swiatek dropped outside of the world's top three in the rankings for the first time in more than three years.

And there's no love lost between them - former world No. 7 Collins blasted the five-time Major winner for being "fake" when they met at the Olympics last summer.

Nick Kyrgios claims he was searched by Wimbledon security and initially denied his credentials because he did not bring a valid form of ID.

He said: "I said, 'do you reckon you could get me in and give me my credentials just one time' and she was like: 'No.' I went: 'Seriously? Please', but they said they can't do that.

"Then I got body searched. They told me to put all of my stuff down and I got body searched."



John McEnroe once invited Wimbledon star Carlos Alcaraz to 'come over to his place sometime' after raving about his positive attitude on the court.

Alcaraz is known as one of the smiliest players on tour, with his demeanour a sharp contrast to that of the fiery McEnroe during his playing days.

After watching the Spaniard in action at SW19 last year, McEnroe joked that he could come to his house and give him private advice on how to be more upbeat.

"He had that positive attitude, which helped," the 66-year-old told the BBC. "You watch Carlos Alcaraz and he's always smiling, whatever the score is.

"He's amazing. I don't know how he does it but it's never too late to teach an old man. Come over to my place sometime!"

Emma Raducanu claimed that she had to wait 20 minutes to have her rackets restrung during the early stages of her loss to Aryna Sabalenka on Friday night.

And the world No.1 responded by claiming that was a rookie mistake by the Brit.

Sabalenka said: "That's more to have an extra racket, maybe not in your bag, but your team," the world No.1 explained. "For example, my team, they always have like two extra racquet with the higher tension and two extra racquets with lower tension. They prepare it. You don't have to wait for another racquet.

"I also had really terrible experience at French Open in year when I lost in semis against Muchova because I didn't have racquet. We weren't prepared. I didn't have a right tension. I had to play with a lower tension. I didn't control the ball, didn't feel well.

"After that experience we learned it's four extra racquets in my team's bag just in case. You never know. You can wake up and feel great with one tension. Another day you wake up and you don't feel at all. You got to be prepared."

British teenagers Mika Stojsavljevic and Hannah Klugman will begin their junior girls' singles campaigns on Saturday after losing early in the main draw.

Stojsavljevic and Klugman, both aged 16, were two of three teenagers to receive wildcards into the women's singles draw here, along with Mingge 'Mimi' Xu.

But all three of them lost in the first round, and two of them have gone back to the juniors.

No. 2 seed Klugman - who reached the junior French Open final last month - faces Sol Ailin Larraya Guidi third on Court 12.

Immediately after, Stojsavljevic will face Mia Pohankova.

Emma Raducanu suggested there was an issue with the electronic line calling system at Wimbledon on Friday, and said she wanted to see it fixed.

Wimbledon abolished line judges this year in favour of the automated system, but several players have taken issue with the accuracy of the hawkeye technology.

The British No. 1 said: "It's kind of disappointing, the tournament here, that the calls can be so wrong, but for the most part they've been okay.

"It's just, like, I've had a few in my other matches, too, that have been very wrong. So yeah, I don't know. Hopefully they can kind of fix that."

There was an incident on Centre Court during Taylor Fritz's match against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.

Play was paused with Fritz leading 6-4 2-1 for a medical emergency in the crowd.

BBC commentator John McEnroe said: "Someone right beside us Simon is in some distress, they've stopped the match."

There was a four-minute delay and Fritz brought over some water to help the spectator as medical personnel took to the stands.

McEnroe later said: "She's conscious, for the elderly, it should be shade only."



Aryna Sabalenka said she learned from her crushing French Open final defeat to Coco Gauff - and the backlash she received after suggesting her mistakes gave Gauff the win - before facing Emma Raducanu at Wimbledon.

The world No. 1 came back from a break down in both sets to beat the Brit 7-6 6-4 on Friday night and said: "I'm kind of happy for what happened to me at the French Open because I had chance to sit back and to look at everything in perspective and realise a lot of things about myself.

"I kind of, like, feel that I'm a different person. I learned from that difficult lesson. Yeah, as you said, because of the recent experience, I was just keep telling myself, 'No, you just cannot let it happen again. Whatever happens on the court, you just have to be respectful, you have to be calm, and you just have to keep trying and keep fighting'."

Emma Raducanu reacted cautiously to Aryna Sabalenka tipping her to soon be back in the world's top 10.

"It's nice of her to say that, but I think it was pretty clear the difference,' said the British star. "In the big moments, she was able to convert, she was able to hit some incredible shots. I just need to keep working and get back to the drawing board and improve a lot more."

There was a strange moment for Cam Norrie in his post-match press conference yesterday.

A journalist said to him: “Some of the gossip has been about who Emma Raducanu is dating. Can I ask if you're dating her?"

“Sorry?” Norrie asked, baffled. The journalist in question ploughed on with: “I'm trying to find out who's dating Emma Raducanu. It seems to be going around all the men's singles. I was wondering if you're dating her, please?”

“I'm not, no,” Norrie replied. “You can ask her though.”



Goran Ivanisevic has spoken crudely about his return to coaching.

He's currently working with Stefanos Tsitsipas, who went out in the first round at Wimbledon, after a trial stint with Elena Rybakina

“I rested just fine for nine months,” he said, on his lay-off. “I put a finger up my a**. I got a tennis player who is the first favourite at Wimbledon, who can win the Grand Slam.

“Then I got out of that situation, rested for four months and then I got into a good situation again. I began to think that something was wrong with me. Or people think that I am the one who solves these problems."

So on Centre Court today, men's top seed Jannik Sinner will start things off against Pedro Martinez.

He'll be followed by Iga Swiatek v Danielle Collins and then Novak Djokovic plays Miomir Kecmanovic.

The full schedule is listed here.

Naomi Osaka admitted she was releived to have finished the grass court season after her defeat to Katerina Siniakova.

"In Paris I was very emotional when I sat there (after losing) and now I don't feel anything. I guess I prefer to feel nothing than everything," she said.

"I'm just going to be a negative human being today. I have nothing positive to say about myself. I'm glad to be done with this, and I'm looking forward to the hard courts."

Carlos Alcaraz was left seething with the technology during his four set win over JL Struff last night.

During a change of ends, the Spaniard complained to the umpire, saying: "I'm not sure about it. I would have asked for a challenge.

"It's not the first time I've seen the machine… it's not the first time. I'm not sure about some calls."

Emma Raducanu fought back tears in her post-match press conference following her defeat to Aryna Sabalenka.

“Having a match like that where I had chances in both sets, it does give me confidence. At the same time, it's very difficult to take right now," she said.

"I think it's better for me to kind of feel a bit of the pain right now and then process it better that way. It's hard. It's hard to take a loss like that."



Welcome back to our live Wimbledon coverage.

Another big day in store with men's world No.1 Jannik Sinner, Novak Djokovic, and Iga Swiatek among the big names in action.

*denotes server

An interesting observer has been spotted in the stands: Emma Raducanu with her coach Mark Petchey. No applause from the British No 1 as the Spanish star wraps up his latest love hold to inch closer to the quarter-finals.

Rublev dumps a backhand into the net and it puts him in trouble at 0-30. A double fault then makes it 0-40. Alcaraz squanders the first two.

Then the third when he nets a forehand return. He gets another chance with Rublev nets a backhand. And this time he gets the job, breaking when he drills a backhand return down the line and Rublev fails to get his forehand into play.

Alcaraz breaks.

First point against the server in this set when Alcaraz sends a forehand into the tramlines, 30-15. He responds to that mistake with an ace.

And safely holds again when Rublev pushes a backhand wide under pressure.

You get there is a great deal of anger in Rublev's ball striking. Seems to be hitting the ball even harder. And it works for him as he completes the third love hold of the set.

Alcaraz jokingly called himself a ‘servebot' at Queen's last month. Hard to argue with that description when he hammers down two aces to hold to love.

Putting on a clinic.

Will that little break help Rublev get back on track? He makes a decent start to the set, holding to love.

That winner seems to have inspired Alcaraz to put his foot to the floor. Now two sets to one up, he is in the mood.

Rublev has headed off court for a toilet break. Taking one last opportunity to enjoy the Centre Court facilities, perhaps. Because, bold as he has been, you can't see him coming back from this. 

Aces 13 and 14 to start the game from Alcaraz. Forehand return into the net brings up three set points. Alcaraz drop shot, Rublev chases after it and gets there but can't get his reply into court.

Alcaraz takes the third set.

 

Rublev hasn't done much wrong but is looking at being two sets to one down and on the brink of defeat.

A fifth ace of the match allows him to hold here. Can he apply any pressure to Alcaraz?

Break consolidated by Alcaraz with a hold to 30. Up to Rublev to hold and make Alcaraz serve for the set.

That's why everyone loves Carlos Alcaraz. Sure he is error prone, but when he can produce a winner like that, when he not only reached a ball apparently completely beyond an ordinary mortal but returned it with a fizzing winner his opponent barely saw, then there is only one response. And the Centre Court crowd was on its feet in appreciation.

Cameron Norrie through to quarter-finals where he could face Carlos Alcaraz; Follow scores, reports and our dedicated live blog over the next fortnight; The US Open is live on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, streaming service NOW and the Sky Sports app from August 24

Sunday 6 July 2025 20:27, UK

Britain's last remaining hope in singles Cameron Norrie made it through to the quarter-finals of Wimbledon after beating Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry in five sets.

The 29-year-old led by two sets and had a match point in the third, but was taken to a fifth by the towering Chilean.

However, Norrie held his nerve in the decider and did not drop serve all day in a 6-3 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (7-9) 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 victory over a gruelling four hours and 27 minutes to return to the last eight for the first time since 2022.

Norrie, the world No 61, a semi-finalist here in 2022 is now only the third British man to reach the last eight more than once in the last 50 years, after Tim Henman and Andy Murray and now the last home player left in the tournament.

Norrie, who has now won nine of his 10 matches on his favourite Court One, said: "I hung tough when I needed to and the atmosphere was so good.

"Credit to Nico, he did an unbelievable job staying with me. I just had to keep fighting.

"It's my coach's birthday and I forgot to get him a present, so I got him the win."

Jarry, 6ft 7in South American, was clearly unhappy about something at the end, with the two players engaged in a long, heated conversation after shaking hands.

"He said I was a little bit vocal, but that's my energy. It was a competitive match," added Norrie.

Jarry hit 103 winners, 46 aces, loses in five sets and four hours and 27 minutes
Incredible effort from Norrie, who reaches a second career Grand Slam quarter-finals, both at Wimbledon.

Norrie scrambled brilliantly to snatch the first set with what proved to be the only break of the first four.

He took the second on a tie-break and had match point in the third-set tiebreak, only for towering Jarry to save it and force a fourth set, which he sealed with an ace.

Jarry, who has seen his ranking plummet from 16 this time last year to 143 due to a health issue which has affected his vision and balance came through qualifying before knocking out eighth seed Holger Rune, American Learner Tien and Brazilian wonderkid Joao Fonseca to reach the fourth round.

He banged down 46 aces to take his tournament-leading tally to 111, but Norrie returned superbly to break early in the decider, save three break points in the next game and close out victory in a marathon encounter.

Sonay Kartal's fine Wimbledon run ended with a fourth-round loss to veteran Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

Kartal was eventually overpowered by the 34-year-old former French Open finalist in a 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 defeat, but the result was overshadowed by a problem with the electronic line-calling system that led Pavlyuchenkova to allege home bias.

On game point serving at 4-4, Pavlyuchenkova was convinced a Kartal shot had landed long but the technology was not working at the time - which Wimbledon organisers later attributed to human error - and the point was replayed.

"STOP STOP" was heard across the court and confusion then reigned as umpire Nico Helwerth picked up his telephone for advice. Television replays showed that Pavlyuchenkova was correct and the ball had landed well out.

But instead of her being awarded the game, Helwerth said that because the technology had failed, the point must be replayed. Eventually the Russian lost the game, allowing Kartal to serve for the first set.

Pavlyuchenkova went on to lose the game, leaving Kartal serving for the opening set, and she furiously told umpire Nico Helwerth at the change of ends: "Because she is local, they can say whatever. You took the game away from me."

Fired-up by the injustice of it all, she showed true grit to raise her game and from then on was the better player, striking a total of 36 winners to Kartal's 14 as she moved through to the quarter-finals here for the first time since losing at that stage to Serena Williams in 2016.

Pavlyuchenkova discussed the matter with Helwerth after the match, and she said: "It was very confusing in the beginning because the ball looked very long to me.

"It was a very crucial moment in the match. I expected a different decision. I just thought also the chair umpire could take the initiative. That's why he's there sitting on the chair. He also saw it out, he told me after the match. I don't know if it's something to do because she's local.

"I think we are losing a little bit of the charm of actually having human beings. Like during Covid, we didn't have ball boys. It just becomes a little bit weird and robot sort of orientated.

"They're very good at giving fines, though, and code violations. This they don't miss because every time any little thing, they are just right there on it. I would prefer they looked at the lines and call the errors better."

While she had hoped to go further, the consolation for Kartal is that she will hit a new career-high ranking next Monday of around 44 and will surpass her childhood rival Emma Raducanu as British No 2.

Kartal said: "I'm obviously pretty devastated to not get the win. People were saying to me that the draw had really opened up but I think she played like a seed today.

"She was seeing the ball so well, taking it super early right from the very first point. She played two games which was almost unplayable for me. I think I did well to keep it as tight as I did.

"A few mistakes at not ideal times. I think that was the only difference today. I'm proud of the week that I've had, for sure.

"I've proved to myself that I can go deep into Slams, I can beat some of the best players on tour. I'm going to go away with a lot of motivation."

U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz moved into the Wimbledon quarterfinals when Jordan Thompson quit with an injury in the second set of their fourth-round match

LONDON — U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz moved into the Wimbledon quarterfinals for the third time in four years on Sunday, advancing when his injured opponent, Jordan Thompson , quit while trailing 6-1, 3-0 after 41 minutes.

The unseeded Thompson's movement and power clearly were compromised. The Australian entered the match with back and leg issues and left the court for a medical timeout in the second set, then stopped after trying to play for three more points.

“Just got significantly worse today,” said Thompson, who was competing in singles and doubles at Wimbledon. “Just played a lot of tennis on a body that shouldn't have been, and it just took its toll.”

For the No. 5-seeded Fritz , it was a shorter workday after playing a pair of five-setters and one four-setter earlier in the tournament.

“It's obviously not the way that I want to go through,” Fritz said. “It's just sad. ... Respect to him for coming out. His body's not right.”

Now the American will meet No. 17 seed Karen Khachanov of Russia on Tuesday for a berth in the semifinals — a round neither has reached at the All England Club.

Khachanov has been a Grand Slam semifinalist twice, at the U.S. Open in 2022 and the Australian Open in 2023. Fritz made it that far at a major for the first time when he got to the final at Flushing Meadows in September before losing to No. 1 Jannik Sinner.

Khachanov beat Kamil Majchrzak 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 Sunday and is 2-0 against Fritz, although their most recent meeting was in 2020.

“We practice all the time, so we're pretty familiar with each other's games,” Fritz said. “But I think I improved a ton and have become a much, much better player since the last time we played.”

No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka reached the quarterfinals at her 11th consecutive Grand Slam tournament, defeating No. 24 Elise Mertens 6-4, 7-6 (4), and will play unseeded Laura Siegemund , the 37-year-old German who followed up her elimination of Australian Open champ Madison Keys by beating lucky loser Solana Sierra 6-3, 6-2. When Siegemund's age was mentioned during an on-court interview, the crowd applauded, and she joked: “It's not that often you get such a compliment for being old.” Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova overcame a missed call late in the first set when the electronic system that replaced line judges at Wimbledon this year was shut off but ended up beating Sonay Kartal 7-6 (3), 6-4 to return to the grass-court major's quarterfinals for the first time in nine years. Pavlyuchenkova's opponent Tuesday will be No. 13 Amanda Anisimova or No. 30 Linda Noskova. In men's action, the last British singles player, 2022 semifinalist Cam Norrie, advanced with a 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-7 (7), 6-7 (5), 6-3 win over qualifier Nicolas Jarry of Chile. The 61st-ranked Norrie, who played college tennis at TCU in Fort Worth, Texas, will go up against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz or No. 14 Andrey Rublev for a spot in the final four.

The quarterfinals will be set after Monday's play, which leads off at Centre Court with 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic against No. 11 Alex de Minaur at 1:30 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. ET). They were supposed to face each other in last year's quarterfinals at Wimbledon, but de Minaur was forced to withdraw before the match with a hip injury. That's to be followed by No. 7 Mirra Andreeva vs. No. 10 Emma Navarro , who eliminated 2024 champion Barbora Krejcikova in the third round, and then No. 1 Jannik Sinner vs. No. 19 Grigor Dimitrov. Others in action: Iga Swiatek, Ben Shelton and Marin Cilic.

Cameron Norrie kept alive home hopes at Wimbledon on Sunday, when he rallied past big-serving Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry in a five-set epic on No. 1 Court to reach the quarter-finals at The Championships for the second time.

Backed by a raucous crowd, the British lefty recovered from squandering one match point on the Jarry serve in the third-set tie-break and a 4/2 lead in the fourth-set breaker to eventually seal a battling 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-7(7), 6-7(5), 6-3 triumph.

After earning victory two hours and one minute afer his first match point, Norrie collapsed to the ground before he rose to his feet to let out a vocal roar, which reverberated around the closed-roofed No. 1 Court.

"Honestly I don't know how I did that. Credit to Nico [Nicolas Jarry]. He did an unbelievable job," Norrie said. "He played better than me in both tie-breaks [that he lost]. I had to keep fighting. I forgot to get my coach a birthday present today, so I had to get the win for him!

"He hung in there but I kept taking care of my serve. The atmosphere was so good and I appreciate the crowd getting me through."

WINNING AT HOME ❤️Norrie takes down Jarry in a five set blockbuster to seal his spot in the quarters 🍿🌱@wimbledon | #wimbledon pic.twitter.com/VOpLhMC6T4

Norrie is just the fourth British player in the Open Era to reach the quarter-finals at Wimbledon on multiple occasions, joining two-time champion Andy Murray, Tim Henman and Roger Taylor. The 29-year-old, who is the only British player left in the draw, now holds a 15-7 record at SW19, having advanced to the semi-finals in 2022.

Norrie will look to return to the semi-finals again on Tuesday when he meets two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz or 14th seed Andrey Rublev in his second major quarter-final.

"At the beginning of this year, I struggled with confidence. I want to enjoy my tennis more and I'm doing that," Norrie said. "It is a bonus to win but enjoying it is what matters. I am so happy to be in another quarter-final in the best tournament in the world."



Norrie struggled to find his best level through the first four months of the season and arrived at the ATP 250 event in Geneva holding a 10-11 record on the year. However, the former Indian Wells champion has since gone 10-4, also reaching the fourth round at Roland Garros. He is up 18 spots to No. 43 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following his latest win.

Jarry has struggled with a nerve disorder in his ear in the past year but looked impressive on London's lawns through the first three rounds. The qualifier upset Top 10 star Holger Rune in the first round and then eliminated #NextGenATP stars Learner Tien and Joao Fonseca to equal his best result at a major.

For the best part of four hours, the Chilean served bombs and clubbed the ball from the baseline in an attempt to hit through the resilient Norrie. He fired 103 winners in the match and saved one match point on serve at 5/6 in the third-set tie-break when he backed up a big serve with a heavy forehand. He then found four first serves from 15/40 down at 2-2 in the fourth set to hold and clinched the set in another tie-break.

However, he finally ran out of steam in the decider, with Norrie staying focused, consistent and aggressive to advance after four hours and 27 minutes in the pair's second Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting (1-1). Jarry, whose career-high is No. 16, is up 48 spots to No. 95 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

CENTRE COURT, THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB — Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova suggested her British opponent may have received preferential treatment as simmering tensions around Wimbledon's use of electronic line calling (ELC) instead of line judges boiled over Sunday, when the technology malfunctioned at a crucial point on Centre Court.

Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova was serving at 4-4, Ad-40 in the first set of her fourth-round match against Britain's Sonay Kartal, when Kartal hit a backhand that clearly bounced out. There was no call from the ELC, which replaced line judges for the first time in Wimbledon's 148-year history. Pavlyuchenkova was waiting for the call, and umpire Nico Helwerth stopped the point before an automated sound saying “stop, stop” could be heard.

After a lengthy break while he spoke to tournament officials, Helwerth explained to the players and the Centre Court crowd that the technology had not been working during the point, which meant it would be replayed. This was despite television footage confirming that Kartal's shot had been well long, and that the point and the game should have been Pavlyuchenkova's.

A spokesperson for the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) said:

“It is now clear that the live ELC system, which was working optimally, was deactivated in error on part of the server's side of the court for one game by those operating the system.

“In that time there were three calls not picked up by live ELC on the affected part of the court. Two of these were called by the Chair Umpire, who was not made aware that the system had been deactivated. Following the third, the Chair Umpire stopped the match and consulted with the Review Official. It was determined that the point should be replayed.

“The chair umpire followed the established process.”

There is no mention of ELC in the 2025 Grand Slam rulebook. The ATP handbook says:

“If the live ELC system fails to make a call, the call shall be made by the chair umpire. If the chair umpire is unable to determine if the ball was in or out, then the point shall be replayed. This protocol applies only to point-ending shots or in the case when a player stops play.”

After the interruption, Kartal won the replayed point and the game to take a 5-4 lead. A furious Pavlyuchenkova told the umpire at the change of ends, “Because she's local, they can say whatever. You took the game away from me.”

She doubled down on this position after the match. “I expected a different decision. I just thought also the chair umpire could take the initiative,” she said in a news conference. “He also saw it out, he told me after the match. I thought he would do that (call it out), but he didn't.

“Instead they just said replay. I don't know if it's something to do because she's local, but yeah, that was a particular moment.”

Asked again whether she had definitely thought at the time that the error was because Kartal was a home player, Pavlyuchenkova responded: “I have to be honest, I did. I thought so because it was very weird.”

The AELTC did not respond to this suggestion nor that of favouritism for Kartal. Their view was that: “The chair umpire followed the established process.”

Pavlyuchenkova came back from the disappointment by breaking Kartal straight back and winning the set in a tiebreak. “It feels like justice,” said British coach and former player Anne Keothavong in commentary for the BBC. She then kept her focus to win the match 7-6(3), 6-4.

Pavlyuchenkova also called for video replay to be added to the ELC protocol. It is used at the U.S. Open and Australian Open, but not at Wimbledon.

“I think we should have a wire system like in football they have or something, so then it's clear for everybody and we can move on right away instead of just guessing. It could sit with me for the rest of the match and then kind of unknown, was it in or out and kind of feeling that it was my game,” she said.

Even before the tournament started, there had been plenty of resistance from Wimbledon traditionalists at the decision to dispense with line judges. All ATP Tour-level events use ELC, as do the Australian Open and the U.S. Open, leaving Roland Garros — where clay helps with the identification of marks — as the only Grand Slam now to rely on the human eye. Ahead of the tournament, All England Club chief executive Sally Bolton said that replacing line judges with ELC was “inevitable”.

Players are generally in favor of the technology, believing it to be more reliable and removing any need on their part to self-officiate. But there have been complaints in the first week of Wimbledon from some high-profile players — including both British No.1s. First Jack Draper said Thursday: “I don't think it's 100 percent accurate, in all honesty,” as he reflected on a wide serve from his opponent that he was sure was out. “A couple of the ones today, it showed a mark on the court. There's no way the chalk would have showed.” Draper did acknowledge that he may well have been wrong.

A day later, Emma Raducanu questioned a call during her defeat to Aryna Sabalenka. Afterwards she said that the call in question was “for sure out.”

“It's kind of disappointing, the tournament here, that the calls can be so wrong, but for the most part they've been OK. It's just, like, I've had a few in my other matches, too, that have been very wrong.”

Replays of the call, a Sabalenka serve, were inconclusive.

Other players have complained about not being able to hear the out calls in amongst the crowd noise, and during the clay swing, players complained about ELC calls not matching up with what the marks on the court were saying. Players have been educated about marks sometimes being deceptive, but Alexander Zverev and others took photos of the clay after what they believed were inaccurate calls. Whether or not they had the correct marks is unknown.

On Saturday, All England Club chair Debbie Jevans hit back at the player criticism, telling the BBC that: “It's funny, because when we did have linesmen, we were constantly asked why we didn't have electronic line calling because it's more accurate than the rest of the tour.”

There have been other high-profile malfunctions. In a very similar incident to Sunday's, Taylor Fritz was on the wrong end against Brandon Nakashima in a match at the Cincinnati Open, a Masters 1,000 event. On that occasion, Nakashima hit a shot that was clearly out and would have seen Fritz up break point. No call was forthcoming however and like on Centre Court the automated “stop, stop” call was heard. Fritz thought the point should have been his once the ball was confirmed as being out, but per the rules it had to be replayed because Fritz had not stopped play.

She'll play Linda Nosková or Amanda Anisimova next, in her 10th Grand Slam quarterfinal and her second at Wimbledon.

U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz moved into the Wimbledon quarterfinals when Jordan Thompson quit with an injury in the second set of their fourth-round match

LONDON — U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz moved into the Wimbledon quarterfinals for the third time in four years on Sunday, advancing when his injured opponent, Jordan Thompson , quit while trailing 6-1, 3-0 after 41 minutes.

The unseeded Thompson's movement and power clearly were compromised. The Australian entered the match with back and leg issues and left the court for a medical timeout in the second set, then stopped after trying to play for three more points.

“Just got significantly worse today,” said Thompson, who was competing in singles and doubles at Wimbledon. “Just played a lot of tennis on a body that shouldn't have been, and it just took its toll.”

For the No. 5-seeded Fritz , it was a shorter workday after playing a pair of five-setters and one four-setter earlier in the tournament.

“It's obviously not the way that I want to go through,” Fritz said. “It's just sad. ... Respect to him for coming out. His body's not right.”

Now the American will meet No. 17 seed Karen Khachanov of Russia on Tuesday for a berth in the semifinals — a round neither has reached at the All England Club.

Khachanov has been a Grand Slam semifinalist twice, at the U.S. Open in 2022 and the Australian Open in 2023. Fritz made it that far at a major for the first time when he got to the final at Flushing Meadows in September before losing to No. 1 Jannik Sinner.

Khachanov beat Kamil Majchrzak 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 Sunday and is 2-0 against Fritz, although their most recent meeting was in 2020.

“We practice all the time, so we're pretty familiar with each other's games,” Fritz said. “But I think I improved a ton and have become a much, much better player since the last time we played.”

No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka reached the quarterfinals at her 11th consecutive Grand Slam tournament, defeating No. 24 Elise Mertens 6-4, 7-6 (4), and will play Laura Siegemund , the 37-year-old German who followed up her elimination of Australian Open champ Madison Keys by beating lucky loser Solana Sierra 6-3, 6-2. When Siegemund's age was mentioned during an on-court interview, the crowd applauded, and she joked: “It's not that often you get such a compliment for being old.” Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova overcame a missed call late in the first set when the electronic system that replaced line judges at Wimbledon this year was shut off but ended up beating Sonay Kartal 7-6 (3), 6-4 to return to the grass-court major's quarterfinals for the first time in nine years. Pavlyuchenkova's opponent Tuesday will be No. 13 Amanda Anisimova or No. 30 Linda Noskova. The men's matches later Sunday were two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz vs. No. 14 Andrey Rublev, and Cam Norrie vs. Nicolas Jarry.

The quarterfinals will be set after Monday's play, which leads off at Centre Court with 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic against No. 11 Alex de Minaur at 1:30 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. ET). They were supposed to face each other in last year's quarterfinals at Wimbledon, but de Minaur was forced to withdraw before the match with a hip injury. That's to be followed by No. 7 Mirra Andreeva vs. No. 10 Emma Navarro , who eliminated 2024 champion Barbora Krejcikova in the third round, and then No. 1 Jannik Sinner vs. No. 19 Grigor Dimitrov. Others in action: Iga Swiatek, Ben Shelton and Marin Cilic.

@TennisPublisher

There has been some hype beyond the happenings at Wimbledon about 59-year-old billionaire and tennis enthusiast Bill Ackman attempting to become the oldest player to earn an ATP ranking point at the Hall of Fame Open Challenger event in Newport, R.I.

The only problem is… he wouldn't be.

According to the ATP, the oldest player to have an ATP ranking was Gardnar Mulloy, whose ranking points in singles and doubles fell off the computer in February of 1978 when he was 64 years old. Mulloy “earned” his ranking point at a Grand Prix event played in North Miami, Florida played at tennis facility called the California Club, where Mulloy was the head teaching pro. In those days of the ATP computer, players earned a ranking point simply by playing in a Grand Prix event and one didn't have to win a match (now, you have to win a match to ear a ranking point) Mulloy only managed to win one game in the first round of singles falling to 23-year-old former NCAA singles champion John Whitlinger 6-0, 6-1

“If it would have been an exhibition match, I would have had a lot more fun with it,” Whitlinger said of the match to the Associated Press at the time. “But when I play tennis, I want to go out there and do the best job I can.”

In doubles at the event, Mulloy partnered with Paul Smith of Australia and lost in the first round to Armistead Neely and Alvaro Fillol 6-2, 6-4.

For those who don't know much of Mulloy, he is a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame who was the runner-up at the U.S. Championships (the modern-day U.S. Open) in 1952 (losing to Frank Sedgman) and who won four U.S. doubles titles and a Wimbledon doubles title in 1957. That title in 1957 made him the oldest player to win a Wimbledon men's doubles title at age 43. That same year, he became the oldest player to play Davis Cup for the United States. Mulloy played competitive tennis into his 90s and won over 100 USTA age group national championships. His last-ever interview on his career, especially his senior tennis career, is featured in the book “Sport of a Lifetime” for sale and download here: https://a.co/d/2G3kghG

Ackman will play doubles in Newport with former Wimbledon and U.S. Open doubles champion Jack Sock, who hasn't played a professional tennis match since losing in the first round of the 2023 U.S. Open, where he announced he was retiring from tennis to play professional pickleball.

Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital Management, said in media interviews that he is playing the best tennis of his life. However, he does not have a Universal Tennis Rating (UTR) and does not even have a profile, which would indicate he has not played any type of “sanctioned” organized tennis for a while. He does annually compete in an event called “The Finance Cup,” among top tennis-playing financers and he reportedly reached the semifinals at the recent event, also held in Newport, alongside former U.S. Open doubles champion Richey Reneberg. (Read of the 2025 Finance Cup in Newport here on Palmer.com here https://palmerpb.com/2025/07/04/wall-street-hits-the-grass-courts-of-newport/) Sock and Ackman only gained entry into the tournament when given a wild card entry from the tournament. Ackman admitted to Front Office Sports last week that he had yet to meet Sock in person.

Ackman wrote on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that Sock was offered the wild card by tournament officials and that he chose to play with him. Earlier this year, Ackman said that he and Nick Kyrgios had discussed playing in a lower-level Challenger or Futures level event together for fun. However, the opportunity has yet to materialize since Kyrgios has been injured.

If Ackman and Sock are able to win a match, Ackman would be the oldest CURRENT ATP-ranked player. The oldest current ATP doubles ranked player is 47-year-old Toshihide Matsui of Japan. The oldest ranked ATP singles player is 44-year-old Ryan Haviland, who re-entered the ATP singles rankings in May, as I discuss in my “TennisPublisher” podcast here: https://www.swellcast.com/t/O1UqB9NxBjx6VDB

Denmark's Lars Elvstrom, incidentally, is the second oldest player to earn an ATP ranking. He “achieved” the feat in doubles at the age of 59 and nine months and the $50,000 Challenger in New Delhi, India in 2008. Elvstrom partnered with the player he was coaching, fellow Dane Kristian Pless, and they advanced into the second round by walkover when Prakash Amritraj and Travis Rettenmaier pulled out of the doubles competition, which strangely only featured 12 teams that entered. Elvstrom, who reached a career-high ranked of No.280 in 1978, and Pless, the former world No. 65, lost in the quarterfinals to Illya Marchenko and Alexander Kudryavtsev 6-2, 6-1.

Ackman, age 59 and nearly two months (born May 11, 1966), would become the second oldest player to earn an ATP ranking if he is able to win a match in Newport as his point(s) would not drop off until after he turns 60.

The list of the oldest players to earn ATP DOUBLES rankings are as follows, as provided by the ATP Tour

The list of oldest players to earn ATP SINGLES rankings are as follows, as provided by the ATP Tour.

Wild card entries into tournaments are at the discretion of the tournament owners. Buying a wild card (providing anything of financial value in exchange for a wild card) is against rules of the International Tennis Integrity Agency and players, tournaments and promoters are subject to severe punishment in the form of fines and suspensions if found to buy a wild card or sell a wild card..

The International Tennis Hall of Fame is hosting a combined men's and women's Challenger level tournament for the first time in 2025, as you can read here https://worldtennismagazine.com/tennis-hall-of-fame-to-host-combined-mens-womens-challenger-starting-in-2025-to-continue-world-class-tennis-legacy/23536. The Challenger, a step-below the ATP and WTA Tours of pro tennis, marks the return of women's pro tennis to Newport since 1990. The event “replaces” the annual ATP Tour stop held in Newport since 1976.

Nicolas Jarry accused Cameron Norrie of disturbing him in an angry rant during their fourth-round clash at Wimbledon. Norrie stormed into a 6-3 7-6 lead on Court 1 and then his Chilean opponent tabled his complaints with the umpire.

Norrie headed off court for a toilet break while Jarry remained seated in his courtside chair and moaned about Norrie's second serve. He felt the Brit was bouncing the ball too many times, then looked like he was going to serve before continuing to bounce the ball.

"What is the rule there? The problem is, is it normal to do that when it affects the other player?" Jarry said to Greek umpire Eva Asderaki-Moore.

"You have to intervene there or I have to suck it. That's the real issue, it doesn't matter the reason. It is the same as hitting the ball anywhere.

"It's not intentional but you have to apply the code as well. How is it now? He perfectly can stop doing it, it's not a nervous tick.

"It's something that he can control. It's not a nervous tick. You think there's nothing I can do so I just have to suck it up, because he does it always.

"That's a reason for me to have to play with something that affects me. It can be changed, it's not something that cannot be changed."



Asderaki-Moore responded: "I am going to step in if I think there is a reason to step in."

But Jarry continued his tirade: "I don't want to force you into anything. I just want to do what the rules say. And if there is not a rule then tell me and I cannot do anything about it."

Asderaki-Moore clarified the rule, saying: "The rule is if it's intentional that he is disturbing then I can do something about it."

Jarry, walking back onto court as Norrie emerged from the bathroom, concluded: "Ok so it has to be intentional, if it's not intentional then there's nothing I can do.

"If that's the rule then I don't need you to say something. I just want to play by the rules because it affects me."

“We're in the second week of Wimbledon. Let's have fun.”

Grigor Dimitrov delivered the words with a smile and a shrug, the kind of casual confidence that only comes after weathering storms. It was Saturday afternoon at the All England Club and the 34-year-old was speaking to a small circle of reporters, relaxed, reflective and very much still in the tournament.

Just an hour earlier, the 34-year-old had sealed his place in the second week at Wimbledon with a commanding straight-sets win against Sebastian Ofner, finishing the job with an ace on No. 3 Court. For the third year in a row, he's among the last 16 at the grass-court major, but this time, the moment carries a different weight. This run feels earned in a way that goes beyond forehands and footwork.

The past twelve months have tested Dimitrov to the limit. Last year, his Wimbledon campaign ended abruptly with a retirement against Daniil Medvedev in the fourth round. At the US Open, he surged into the quarter-finals, only to be halted mid-match by injury once again, this time against Frances Tiafoe.
The trend continued into 2025, with first-round retirements at both the Australian Open and Roland Garros, marking a grim milestone: four consecutive Grand Slam retirements.
“I think that's why you have everybody around you, all your team, to keep you honest with whatever is going on with your body,” Dimitrov said when asked on how he has coped with his recent struggles. “The amount of scans and MRIs and X-rays, whatever that I've done throughout this amount of time, it confirms where you're at, but ultimately you're the one that gets to that point of thinking or not thinking.
“Some days it's inevitable [that you think about the injury issues] just because you wake up and you feel something. But this is also a place where I'm entering in my career that I have to accept the fact that there's going to be something every single day. So I live with it, and I'm okay with it. As long as I've gone to work, match, tennis tournament, or whatever it is, and I've done 100 per cent of myself, then I've done my duty.”

Dimitrov touched down in London five weeks ago to train and importantly, recover. Fresh off a frustrating retirement at Roland Garros, the Bulgarian set up camp in the capital for rehab, trading court time for careful recovery. A leg injury, lingering for the better part of nine months, had demanded a new approach of fewer practice sessions, more rest and a strict focus on injury prevention.
So far, the strategy has paid off. Dimitrov has looked sharp and composed on the lawns of SW19, dropping just one set en route to the fourth round.
“At the moment I feel great. I'm pain-free,” Dimitrov said with optimism. “I've done quite a sufficient amount of work before the tournament began. Overall, every day has been positive. I feel like I'm building off that, which makes me not only happy but excited for what's to come.”
That excitement shows. After three matches, he's moving freely and striking the ball cleanly. A far cry from the physical uncertainty that's overshadowed much of his past year.
“All I want is to put myself in those type of positions,” Dimitrov added. “To get out there and play against these guys right now. This is in a way the most important thing for me.”

But the challenge gets steeper from here. On Monday, Dimitrov will face the ultimate test when he meets the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Jannik Sinner, who's been near untouchable so far. The Italian has dopped just 17 games in three rounds, tying the Open Era record for fewest games dropped en route to the fourth round at Wimbledon.
Sinner has spent the past 56 weeks atop the PIF ATP Rankings and has won two of the past three majors.
“He's been the best player in the world, especially over the course of the last year and a half, two [years],” Dimitrov said on Sinner. “You can appreciate his consistency, I would say, and the way he is able to execute without a single doubt in his game.”
The numbers favour Sinner, who leads former World No. 3 Dimitrov 4-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. But this will be their first meeting on grass, a surface where Dimitrov, a semi-finalist here in 2014, has always felt at home.

“The grass is very different right now. If you would have asked me a couple of years ago, maybe it was a bit faster and I would think yeah,” Dimitrov said. “At the moment, everybody is playing good on grass, and the grass evens out the game a little bit. I would say this year especially.
“I know what I want to do out there. It's more of the excitement of checking out my capabilities and the work that I've put in, the plays that I've tried, the hours that I spent on the court.”
In a tournament already full of upsets, Dimitrov will be aiming to deliver the most dramatic one yet when he walks onto Centre Court around 6 p.m. BST. But whatever happens, the former World No. 3 is clear-eyed about what matters most.
“I'm very positive at the stage where I'm at,” Dimitrov concluded. “Physically is probably the number one thing that I really need the most, and it's there right now. The rest is having fun.”

A leg injury, lingering for the better part of nine months, had demanded a new approach of fewer practice sessions, more rest and a strict focus on injury prevention.

So far, the strategy has paid off. Dimitrov has looked sharp and composed on the lawns of SW19, dropping just one set en route to the fourth round.

“At the moment I feel great. I'm pain-free,” Dimitrov said with optimism. “I've done quite a sufficient amount of work before the tournament began. Overall, every day has been positive. I feel like I'm building off that, which makes me not only happy but excited for what's to come.”

That excitement shows. After three matches, he's moving freely and striking the ball cleanly. A far cry from the physical uncertainty that's overshadowed much of his past year.

“All I want is to put myself in those type of positions,” Dimitrov added. “To get out there and play against these guys right now. This is in a way the most important thing for me.”

But the challenge gets steeper from here. On Monday, Dimitrov will face the ultimate test when he meets the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Jannik Sinner, who's been near untouchable so far. The Italian has dopped just 17 games in three rounds, tying the Open Era record for fewest games dropped en route to the fourth round at Wimbledon.
Sinner has spent the past 56 weeks atop the PIF ATP Rankings and has won two of the past three majors.
“He's been the best player in the world, especially over the course of the last year and a half, two [years],” Dimitrov said on Sinner. “You can appreciate his consistency, I would say, and the way he is able to execute without a single doubt in his game.”
The numbers favour Sinner, who leads former World No. 3 Dimitrov 4-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. But this will be their first meeting on grass, a surface where Dimitrov, a semi-finalist here in 2014, has always felt at home. Could it level the playing field?

“The grass is very different right now. If you would have asked me a couple of years ago, maybe it was a bit faster and I would think yeah,” Dimitrov said. “At the moment, everybody is playing good on grass, and the grass evens out the game a little bit. I would say this year especially.
“I know what I want to do out there. It's more of the excitement of checking out my capabilities and the work that I've put in, the plays that I've tried, the hours that I spent on the court.”
In a tournament already full of upsets, Dimitrov will be aiming to deliver the most dramatic one yet when he walks onto Centre Court around 6 p.m. BST. But whatever happens, the former World No. 3 is clear-eyed about what matters most.
“I'm very positive at the stage where I'm at,” Dimitrov concluded. “Physically is probably the number one thing that I really need the most, and it's there right now. The rest is having fun.”

Kartal wins controversial game after electronic line-calling system fails

Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova said a game was 'stolen' from her when Wimbledon's electronic line-calling system failed during her fourth-round match against Britain's Sonay Kartal.

There was no 'out' call when a Kartal backhand went long at 4-4 in the first set, with chair umpire Nico Helwerth halting play.

Russian Pavlyuchenkova had seen the ball was out -  and a TV replay showed that was the case by some distance.

Addressing the crowd, Helwerth said: "We're just going to check if the system was up and running, because there was no audio call."

After a telephone call, he announced the electronic system "was unfortunately unable to track the last point" and ordered the point to be replayed.

Umpires can decide to make their own call if the system breaks down and are also entitled to replay the point. 

Had the ball been called out, Pavlyuchenkova would have won the point and taken the lead.

Instead, it was replayed, Kartal won the point and went on to break for a 5-4 lead.

The fact Pavlyuchenkova went on to win the match meant the malfunction was not as costly as it could have been, although she still questioned why the umpire did not call it out.

"That's why he's there," she said. "He also saw it out, he told me after the match. 

"I thought he would do that, but he didn't. Instead they just said replay.

"I don't know if it's something to do [with Kartal being] local.

"I think it's also difficult for him. He probably was scared to take such a big decision."

The electronic line-calling system did not call the shot from Sonay Kartal out

Pavlyuchenkova was clearly frustrated when she returned to her chair at the end of the game.

She told the umpire: "I don't know if it's in or out. How do I know? How can you prove it? 

"You took the game away from me ... They stole the game from me. They stole it." 

A spokesperson for the All England Club said: "Due to operator error the system was deactivated on the point in question.

"The chair umpire followed the established process."

The automated line-calling system was introduced at Wimbledon for the first time this year.

Debbie Jevans - chair of the All England Club - said on Friday she was confident in its accuracy and the decision to bring it in.

The umpire explained to the players there had been no line call 

Electronic line-calling technology has been under scrutiny this week at Wimbledon, with a number of players saying they do not trust it.

Such an obvious failure on the biggest stage - on Centre Court, in a match featuring a British player - has ensured this topic will not go away.

Britain's Emma Raducanu has been one of those to voice concerns, saying some of the calls had been "dodgy", while former Olympic champion Belinda Bencic said the technology was a topic of discussion among players in the locker room.

Bencic said she was usually a fan of the technology but "it is not correct" at this tournament.

Line judges have been replaced by technology at many top-level tournaments, including the US Open and Australian Open.

Jevans previously said the technology was brought in because "the players wanted it" and some have backed the system, with former world number one Iga Swiatek saying she has had doubts but "has to trust" the calls.

Britain's Billie Jean King Cup captain Anne Keothavong said the error was something the tournament referee and organisers would have to "reflect on" and see "what could have been done better".

"If there is uncertainty, that creates anxiety," she said on BBC TV. "They [players] just need to feel reassured that the technology is working and the person who is pressing the buttons is doing the job they are meant to do.

"Hopefully we don't see mistakes like this again."

Former world number one Tracy Austin said the fault had been a "one-off".

"An interesting, dramatic situation that I'm sure we will fix in the future but it was tough to watch for those few minutes," the American added.

When there were line judges, players could challenge the calls by using an electronic review. There are no challenges under the current system and video replays are not used.

Rublev's lone win over the defending champion came last year on clay.ByDavid KanePublished Jul 06, 2025 copy_link

Published Jul 06, 2025

The second week of the 2025 Wimbledon Championships kicks off in earnest on Sunday with defending champion Carlos Alcaraz taking on No. 14 seed Andrey Rublev in one of the most intriguing matches of the day.Alcaraz has won his last 17 matches at the All England Club and leads Rublev 2-1 in their head-to-head, but does the former world No. 5 have a shot at the upset?TC Analyst Jim Courier argued Rublev's biggest weakness could turn into a strength on Centre Court.“If you look at a heat map of where his second serve goes on every surface, it's into the body,” said Courier, a former world No. 1. “We know what's coming there. But on grass, that is the place you want to go: a slice second serve into the body actually is the ideal serve.“Would I like to see more variety? I've been yelling and screaming about it when I call his matches for years. But in this particular match, trying to get into the body of Alcaraz should give him opportunities to be more offensive. So, if there is a saving grace in this match, his Achilles heel might actually help him get more forehands.”

So, if there is a saving grace in this match, his Achilles heel might actually help him get more forehands.”

Lindsay Davenport noted Rublev will not only need to be aggressive to challenge Alcaraz, whom he beat last year en route to winning the clay-court Mutua Madrid Open title, but also be open to improvisation.“You probably start off the match, if you're Rublev, from the back of the court, trying to do what you do best,” said Davenport, who won Wimbledon in 1999. “Take stock of what's happening out there. You absolutely have to be willing to go to a Plan B if Plan A is going awry out there.“On this surface, you've really got to go for everything. If the serve is not working, you've got to change up your location. Coming into net on grass is a good second choice.”Rublev has aimed to work on his resilience after an underwhelming 2024 season, having been open about past mental health struggles. He hired former world No. 1 Marat Safin as his coach earlier this year, hoping to break the ceiling of 10 Grand Slam quarterfinal finishes.“I think the biggest thing for him is, you just don't want to go in and play your regular game and hope Alcaraz has a bad day,” agreed Prakash Amritraj. “You come in, commit to an aggressive game plan either by coming to the net or changing things around on the serve, and roll the dice that way versus doing the same thing.”

Jon Wertheim was less optimistic for Rublev coming into the clash, pointing to Alcaraz's steady improvements through his first three rounds at SW19.“This is kind of how he rolls,” Wertheim said of Alcaraz, the reigning Roland Garros champion. “It's funny because we saw the same thing at Roland Garros. [Jannik] Sinner is just machine-like, barely giving up games. Carlos lost two sets in his first match and then he lost a set playing the other day against Struff. He's sort of up and down and that's how it was at Roland Garros, as well. He won the last set played in the entire tournament and that's ultimately what matters.“He played a really lousy first match, let's put it that way,” echoed Martina Navratilova. “He won in five sets, played much better in the second match and the third round, as well. As he gets less nervous and gets better opponents, he will keep playing better tennis.”Alcaraz and Rublev face off as the third match on Centre Court Sunday.

                Siegemund meets history-maker Sierra in a battle of grit and momentum.            

Laura Siegemund will face history-making lucky loser Solana Sierra in the Wimbledon 2025 fourth round, a matchup few predicted, but one that's now impossible to ignore. Sierra, Argentina's No. 1, has become the first lucky loser in the Open Era to reach the second week at Wimbledon, taking out ninth seed Paula Badosa, Katie Boulter, and Cristina Bucsa, all in grueling three-setters.

Siegemund, meanwhile, has breezed past her opposition, including sixth seed Madison Keys, Leylah Fernandez, and Peyton Stearns, all in straight sets. While singles success has largely disappointed her this season, she's remained sharp through doubles, picking up a title in Nottingham and a runner-up finish in Adelaide. Despite modest singles numbers with 10 aces and 59.4% first-serve points won, 32.2% break-point conversion shows her opportunistic edge.

Sierra's rise has mostly come through the Challenger circuit, with a title in Antalya and deep runs in Cancun and Valencia. Until now, she hadn't advanced past the first round at a main-draw WTA event this year, making her Wimbledon surge all the more stunning. With a 55.6% first-serve win rate and 40% break-point conversion, Sierra may lack top-tier polish, but her grit is undeniable.

Laura Siegemund and Solana Sierra don't have a head-to-head yet.

Sierra's dream run has captured imaginations, but Siegemund's experience and clean, straight-set wins suggest she's peaking at the right time. Expect the German to edge it in a tighter-than-expected contest.

Flavio Cobolli has marched through to the Wimbledon fourth round after dismissing Czechia's Jakub Mensik.

Despite a rain delay postponing the match, Cobolli's momentum was rarely halted on Saturday, with the Italian triumphing 6-1 7-6 6-3 against his opponent – who recently admitted he has barely played on grass.

The Italian, who is a future star on the ATP Tour, has spoken about his tennis influences and idols, including Novak Djokovic.

However, when speaking with the Tennis Channel after Monday's Wimbledon victory, the world number 24 revealed another idol of his.

Cobolli, who admitted he doesn't like to watch tennis, said his idol is ‘one of the most talented players ever.'

Speaking to the Tennis Channel on Monday, Cobolli named a surprise player as ‘one of the most talented players ever.'

The Italian, who has reached his first Grand Slam fourth round, noted the influence of Fabio Fognini on his tennis career.

Cobolli said: “I didn't like watching tennis. I don't want to watch any match. I really don't like, I prefer football. But when Nole and Fabio played this on this year I always watch their matches.

“They're my biggest idols. I started to play tennis because of him (Fognini) in Italy. I think he's one of the most talented players ever and yeah we have a big relationship, we are good friends. I watch the match here he play on Wimbledon. For me he can continue for many years.”

Fognini, who was making his final appearance at SW19 this year and is expected to retire in 2025, produced a valiant performance in the first round against French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz, before losing in five sets.

The ever-lasting figure of Marin Cilic continues to impress on the ATP Tour. The 36-year-old, who knocked out Jack Draper in the second round, beat Spain's Jaume Munar to set up a clash against the 23-year-old Italian.

The Croatian veteran is no stranger to the big stage. He is back in the fourth round of Wimbledon for the first time since 2017, where he made the final before losing to Roger Federer in five sets.

A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)

Cilic, winner of the 2014 US Open, hit 50 unforced errors against Munar. However, he offset this alarming statistic by totalling 47 winners.

Cobolli and Cilic are set to face off on Monday, with the winner to play either Novak Djokovic or Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals.

Goran Ivanisevic is unafraid to hold back what he really thinks about the current state of the ATP Tour.

Ivanisevic is the current coach of Stefanos Tsitsipas, beginning their partnership for the grass court season.

The Croatian is used to success as a coach, with Ivanisevic previously mentoring Novak Djokovic and Marin Cilic to a combined 10 Grand Slam titles.

However, things have not got off to the best start, with Ivanisevic publicly criticising Tsitsipas after his first round defeat at Wimbledon.

The 2001 Wimbledon champion has not left it there, with Ivanisevic now making some strong comments about the ATP Tour including Ben Shelton.

In an interview with Clay, Ivanisevic was asked many questions including what he thought about the current state of the ATP Tour.

While he heaped praise on world number four Jack Draper, who was beaten by Cilic at Wimbledon this year, Ivanisevic admitted that he found the instability of the ATP Tour ‘sad'.

The 53-year-old went on to claim that Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz were light years above the rest of the field. 

“Honestly, I first saw Draper when Novak played him in the first round here at Wimbledon in 2021,” said Ivanisevic. “I liked him right away — I saw he could definitely be in the top 10. His rise doesn't surprise me. 

“The rest… it's all unstable — one day someone is fifth, the next day they're seventh or eighth. Tommy Paul, Shelton… I can't say they're better players than Tsitsipas. It's actually a bit sad — they all work hard, but they're light years behind Alcaraz and Sinner. 

“And Novak is still there, though at the end of his career. It's tough — you play, you train, and you know you can't win a Slam — either one or the other will beat you.”

Sinner and Alcaraz have shared the last six Grand Slam titles between them, highlighted by the most recent Roland Garros final that has been called one of the best major finals ever.

After his strong claim about the ATP Tour, Ivanisevic was subsequently asked if he thinks anyone can close the gap.

The only player that he suggested can currently challenge Alcaraz and Sinner at a major is Djokovic, who Ivanisevic has made a Wimbledon prediction about.

“At a smaller event — maybe. At a Slam — no,” answered Ivanisevic. “I don't see anyone who can do that — unless someone beats them up the night before (laughter). I don't see how. 

“Look at the Australian Open final — you had [Alexander] Zverev, world No. 3, a phenomenal player, and that final was a joke — Sascha had zero chance. 

“Then you see the Roland Garros final — that was otherworldly tennis. The only one who can come between them is Novak. Maybe I'm a bit emotional, but he's a contender to win.”

Novak Djokovic has become only the second men's player to reach 100 match wins at Wimbledon, but how does his record compare to his two great rivals Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer at the four respective Grand Slams?

The 24-time Grand Slam winner is only the second male after Federer (105) to record a century a victories at Wimbledon, although both are behind the great Martina Navratilova in terms of most-ever wins at the All England Club for both men and women as the nine-time champion has 120 wins.

For Djokovic, though, it is yet another milestone on his impressive list of achievements with win No 100 coming with a straight-set win over Miomir Kecmanovic in the third round at this year's grass-court Grand Slam.

“That sounds very nice. I am very grateful and privileged to be in this position. Tennis made me who I am and has given me incredible things in life. I never take anything for granted, especially at this age,” the Serbian said.

“I am still pushing myself to the limits and getting some splits and slides on the court. Wimbledon is a dream tournament of so many of us players. Any history here is a blessing.”

Interestingly, although Djokovic is the only player to have 90 or more match wins at all the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, he doesn't have the outright record in any of the majors.

Not yet anyway.

Although Djokovic holds the record for most titles as he has won the season-opening Grand Slam 10 times, he is actually second on the list for most match wins.

Federer won only six trophies at Melbourne Park, but he won a record 102 match wins before retiring in 2022.

Djokovic, though, looks set to surpass that milestone as the Serbian currently sits on 99 while two-time champion Nadal had 77 wins Down Under.

With 14 titles at Roland Garros, Nadal was always going to be No 1 with match wins in Paris as he has a record 112 victories with only four (4) defeats in 19 main draw appearances.

But Djokovic has also reached the 100-win milestone as he achieved it during the 2025 edition of the clay-court Grand Slam as he moved to 101.

Federer is a distant third with 73 wins.

Federer won eight Wimbledon trophies and he recorded his 100th win in 2019, but won only another five matches at SW19 before retiring.

The Swiss's record is in danger of being broken by Djokovic, but the good news for Federer is it won't be this year as the Serbian can only move up to 104 if he wins the title.

The grass-court major is Nadal's worst in terms of the Slams as he won 58 matches at Wimbledon, having made only 15 main draw appearances.

First things first, Jimmy Connors has the record for most victories at the US Open as he won 98 matches.

Djokovic, though, sits second with 90 and he could potentially move to 97 this year, but then he would have to win the tournament.

Five-time US Open champion Federer retired with 89 while Nadal – a four-time champion in New York – notched up 67 wins during his career.

Djokovic might not hold the record for the individual tournaments, but he has the record for total Grand Slam wins as he sits on 390 and counting, ahead of Federer (369) and Nadal (314).

First things first, Jimmy Connors has the record for most victories at the US Open as he won 98 matches.

Djokovic, though, sits second with 90 and he could potentially move to 97 this year, but then he would have to win the tournament.

Five-time US Open champion Federer retired with 89 while Nadal – a four-time champion in New York – notched up 67 wins during his career.

Djokovic might not hold the record for the individual tournaments, but he has the record for total Grand Slam wins as he sits on 390 and counting, ahead of Federer (369) and Nadal (314).

Novak Djokovic is one of many big names to have signed up for the new US Open mixed doubles event.

Djokovic has progressed to the fourth round of Wimbledon for the 17th time in his career after beating his compatriot Miomir Kecmanovic.

Despite not winning a Grand Slam tournament for nearly two years, it has been suggested that Djokovic has sent a message to Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz after his latest victory.

Although Djokovic's current focus is on Wimbledon, he also appears to have one eye on the revamped US Open mixed doubles event.

The US Open has completely revamped their mixed doubles event this year, changing the format, number of teams and giving priority to singles players.

Due to this decision, the US Open has received a lot of criticism including from the defending mixed doubles champions.

Despite this, the US Open has announced a blockbuster initial lineup that includes Emma Raducanu and Alcaraz, Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe, as well as Sinner and Emma Navarro.

Djokovic will partner his fellow Serbian Olga Danilovic, and he has now revealed that she was the first name that came to his mind when the new US Open mixed doubles event was announced.

The 24-time Grand Slam champion also acknowledged criticism of the event, but suggested that he thought the US Open had made a good move in terms of entertainment.

“When I heard about the new change of the mixed doubles event at the US Open, she [Danilovic] was the first one I thought of, you know, I want to play with a Serbian player and you know, she's obviously the top right now, so we were both excited, you know,” Djokovic said in his Wimbledon press conference. “So it's going to be fun, you know.

“I know that there's quite divided opinions on whether this should have taken place, this change or not. I understand the arguments on both sides, to be honest. But I guess in terms of the fun and entertainment and attracting the top players and singles, both men, women, that's what they got with this change.

“But I do, again, I do understand the arguments on the other side saying, you know, two days, short format, you shouldn't be named at Grand Slam champion, but it is what it is, and the US Open, or USTA makes these decisions, and I'm excited to do that, to play that.

“A mixed doubles event. It's a very short couple day event, but I think it should be very, very entertaining.”

Djokovic has made five Grand Slam appearances in men's doubles, but never in mixed competition.

However, he has played a mixed doubles tournament before at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.

On that occasion he partnered another Serbian in Nina Stojanovic, with the pair making it all the way to the semi-finals.

However, they lost that semi-final and Djokovic would then controversially withdraw from their subsequent bronze medal match.

Djokovic will be hoping to improve on his Tokyo Olympics performance when he partners with Danilovic at the US Open, but first he will focus on Wimbledon.

The 38-year-old will now face 11th seed Alex de Minaur, who he has won two of his three previous meetings against.

Not only were Djokovic's historic milestones impressive, but the way he got to them was, too, with his one-hour-and-47-minute masterclass against Kecmanovic.The 24-time Grand Slam champion had more than three times as many winners as unforced errors on the day, 60 to 19, and more than five times as many aces as double faults, 16 to 3.There was only one slight hiccup in an otherwise flawless performance, as he lost three games in a row in the third set for a 5-1, double-break lead to become a 5-4, one-break lead. But he served it out in the next game."I have enjoyed myself very much, except maybe the last couple of games," he joked in his on-court interview. "Obviously a bit of tension in the end, you know. I was 5-1 up, 15-30, then it was 5-4, 15-30, and things got a bit complicated."But it's never easy playing a friend and compatriot. Miomir is a super nice guy, someone that I have known for many years, and we've faced each other in different surfaces, different courts. But more than rivals and competitors we're friends and teammates, and I wish him all the very best."

Djokovic was then informed of his 100-win milestone."Very historic. It sounds very nice," he replied. "Very grateful, obviously. I'm very privileged to be in the position that I am. I've said it many times, tennis made me who I am and has given me incredible things in life that I can experience, and I try not to take anything for granted, particularly at this age, still going strong, still trying to compete with the young players and doing some slides and splits on the court, pushing myself to the limit."Wimbledon is a favorite tournament and a dream tournament of not just myself, but so many—probably the majority—of the tennis players. Growing up, most kids dream of playing here and winning here, and I've been blessed to do it multiple times."Any history I make at my favorite tournament, I'm blessed."

Sonay Kartal hopes to inspire the next generation of athletes when she continues her Wimbledon campaign on Sunday, making her Centre Court debut.

The British No.3 is through to the second week of a Major for the first time in her career and faces former world No.11 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for a spot in the quarters. After learning she would open Centre Court, Kartal, 23, said: “It's a huge honour to play on that court. A court that you dream of. As a kid, you want to play on it.”

Super-strong Kartal, who stands at just 5 ft and 4” tall, is known for her muscular physique. But she wasn't always into fitness.

The Brighton-based star said: “I wasn't always strong. Yeah, I used to hate fitness back in the day. Lockdown happened, I nothing to do, I turned to it as a bit of an escape, as something to do for a bit of fun.

“Yeah, I was speaking to my fitness coach. We were just trying to get creative. I obviously didn't have crazy weights or anything. So it was just for running or trying to do bodyweight stuff and things like that, and it just completely changed the way I viewed it.

I absolutely loved it. I took it as a bit of like an escape, so then when tennis started to kick back in, it was not a chore at all, I loved it and I'd go to the gym and just kind of have a bit of me time and stick my headphones in and just forget about the world, I guess, and listen to music.”

However, Kartal may have to give up her membership to a high-street budget gym after her Wimbledon run.



The world No.51 added: “It was getting a bit tricky prior, so I do think I'll have to move. But they were actually pretty respectful there, they would just say hello and then let me get on with it. So maybe I'll have to test that when I'm back.”

And Kartal wants girls to feel confident being strong. She added: “I think it's changing, now a lot of girls are getting more comfortable with having more muscle on their body, which is incredible.

“I don't think anyone should feel like girls have to look a certain way, that's changing in tennis as well. You look at the tennis players, everyone's all different physiques and sizes and heights. So, it's definitely getting more versatile, but, I mean, if I can inspire kids, whether that's boys, girls, whatever, then I'm obviously doing something good.”

Three children she hopes to inspire are her nieces and nephew, aged nine, six and four, who have been watching her from afar, and could come to SW19 on Sunday.

Kartal, 23, said: “Their school has been really sweet, they've set up projectors in their classrooms so they've all been watching it and all the kids have done posters.

“My sister's kids aren't the sportiest, but I'm trying to get them into it. I don't think they're going to be the next best tennis player, but if I can get them into some sport, whatever that is, I think that will help them massively.”

Kartal's long-time coach, former British No.1 Julie Hobbs, was responsible for keeping her in tennis when she quite literally almost fell at the first hurdle. Now, the British No.3 wants to be the motivating figure for the next generation.

“At my club, we used to do this thing where the younger kids used to call it the lines game, it's like a little warm-up,” she explained.

“You know, they'd shout ‘service line;, and all the kids had to run the service line and things like that, and that was always the first game and I was too shy for like three months to actually come on court.

“So my coach Julie finally managed to get me to do it, that game, I went on court, I tried to run to, like, outside tram line, tripped over, burst into tears, off I went and yeah, didn't come back for a good couple of months.”

No Bull, no Fluff, No Smudges

WIMBLEDON, England — I was taller than Reilly Opelka when I first met him.

I tell this to people all the time and they either laugh right away or throw an incredulous look at me.

But it's true. I was 5-foot-5 then, in 2009, and I'm still 5-foot-5 (OK fine, since my hair is mostly gone I'm probably 5'4”). He was around 5-3.

Of course, he was also only 11 years old.

In the 16 years I've known the 7-foot professional tennis player and former Indian Trails Middle School student, I've seen him in all kinds of mental states.

I've seen him joyous, such as when he qualified for the U.S. Open Juniors in 2013, as a 15-year-old, and his parents (George and Lynne) and I stood on a walkway inside Arthur Ashe Stadium and looked at each other and said “Can you believe we're actually here?”

Or when he won his first ATP Tour title, on Long Island at the New York Open in 2019. I was fortunate to be in attendance that whole week, and afterwards he couldn't stop grinning as we reminisced about his first coach, former tennis star Tom Gullikson, and their practice sessions at Grand Haven and elsewhere.

I've seen him surprised, and a little shell-shocked, such as when he won the Junior Boys title at Wimbledon in 2015, and he insisted to me on the phone after the match that it wasn't that big a deal, even though it of course very much was.

I've seen him angry, such as when things weren't going his way during his slow and steady climb up the ladder of the ATP Tour. Like all tennis players (except maybe Jannik Sinner, who never seems to get angry), Opelka has sometimes snapped at lines judges and chair umpires, because this tennis thing is a very frustrating sport.

So yeah, I've seen Opelka in just about every mood there is. But Thursday afternoon, in Interview Room 5 in the Media Pavilion here at Wimbledon, I saw a guy who looked defeated.

Depressed, frustrated and at a loss as to what's going on with his career.

Opelka has worked so hard these last few years to come back from injury; he endured a horrific botched wrist surgery, had another operation to fix it, and was off the pro tour for more two years, until returning last July.

When Opelka finally made it back, he was thrilled just to be healthy again, and knew that he'd need a few months to shake the rust off and start moving back up the tennis ladder.

This is a guy who was No. 17 in the world just a few years ago, and on the verge of making a major Grand Slam breakthrough. Many, including John McEnroe, said he'd win Wimbledon one day, what with his rocketship of a serve that goes above 140 miles per hour and zooms past hapless opponents after hitting the perfectly manicured green grass here.

But it's been eight months, and Thursday at Wimbledon brought another second-round loss, this time to American Brandon Nakashima, in four sets.

“I got dominated,” Opelka told me. “It sucks. I lose second round every week, and it sucks. Something has to change.”

The big 28-year-old, who has lost in the second round of his last four events, said his tough defeats lately aren't physical. He said his body feels “really good” after ramping up and playing a regular schedule of tournaments in 2025. He entered Wimbledon ranked No. 70.

The problem, ironically, is his serve. What has long been his most dangerous weapon is betraying him. When things are going well, Opelka gets 70-75 percent of his first serves in play, and wins 90 percent of those points.

These last few months, Opelka said, he's getting 60 percent of his first serves in, and winning only 75 percent of those points.

“Those are the only numbers that matter,” he said. “Right now my serve is just really really bad.”

Denis Kudla, a former pro who's been a traveling coach for Opelka for the past year, is more optimistic about how his player is doing.

“There's a long way to go but he's getting there,” Kudla said. “Sometimes we all want fast results. Reilly understands the process, and he's a professional. Slow and steady, he's getting there.”

Opelka isn't so sure.

“I'll quit,” he said. “You don't make any money losing second round every week. If I keep losing, I'll just wait until my ranking drops to the point where it's really bad, and then I'll quit.”

I hope this was just frustration talking, because after all the work and effort he's put in, I'd hate to see him quit.

Then again, Opelka has always been a different cat, as they say, who was never totally single-minded about tennis. He's a lover of art, going to galleries in all the European cities he's been to while playing, and has struck up friendships with gallery owners like Tim van Laere in Belgium.

Some players, you wonder what they'd do with themselves all day if they didn't have tennis. Opelka isn't like that. He's got plenty of outside interests. He's smart, well-spoken and could be a great broadcaster if he wanted to be.

If he's not happy and struggling with tennis, then maybe it's good he's thinking of leaving. He's still young, after all.

But I hope that's not the case. He deserves to come all the way back and have the kind of success he was having a few years ago, the kind that seemed preordained all those years ago on the courts of the Palm Coast Tennis Center, the courts that now bear his name.

It would only be fitting for the tallest tennis player in history to reach new heights before he's through.

Back when the Tennis Center was being expanded Holland-Alfin of 2021, this was a worst case fear I commented about back then, Alfin would sink money into “courts of dreams” as some investment into the community & the star player that it would be named after wouldn't have longevity for the sport of tennis, not achieve the titles. The tennis associations weren't guaranteeing tournaments for a player that lives in South Florida at this point, has been when tennis center expansion was a huge gamble.

And here we are ? Several injuries and he's a long shot to make it past the 2nd round ? If he continues, he might want to only travel USA tournaments, maybe find a men's or mixed doubles partner ? International travel to lose in the 2nd round constantly, like he says, won't be even career earnings for breakeven for those trips to France (French Open), Italy (Italian Open), Spain (Madrid Open) & England (Wimbledon). Australia & other Asian tournaments might be something he has a better shot at. Hope he gets well. But from the reads of injury after injury, athletes that are 7 feet tall, when their body fails them, walking like a mere mortal is challenging enough.

Max Verstappen claimed an impressive pole position in Qualifying for the British Grand Prix, the Red Bull driver getting the better of the McLaren pair.

Max Verstappen has clinched pole position at the British Grand Prix, the Red Bull driver storming through with a stunning lap to put himself at the front of the grid ahead of the McLarens of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris.

While Piastri had secured provisional pole during the first runs of Q3, the Australian made a mistake on his final effort and could not improve. But Verstappen put his lap together perfectly to go fastest on an effort of 1m 24.892s, putting himself 0.103s clear of Piastri's McLaren.

The other papaya car of Lando Norris will start from third, the Briton also unable to better his previous time on his last flying lap. George Russell followed for Mercedes in fourth, while Lewis Hamilton wound up in fifth, despite the Ferrari driver being Piastri's closest challenger in the first runs.

Hamilton's team mate Charles Leclerc claimed sixth, with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli taking seventh ahead of Ollie Bearman in eighth, though the Haas driver will start near the back of the field thanks to a 10-place grid penalty for a red flag infringement in third practice.

Fernando Alonso put his Aston Martin in ninth place, while Pierre Gasly was an impressive 10th at the wheel of the Alpine.

Qualifying results

FORMULA 1 QATAR AIRWAYS BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2025

Williams had a disappointing day, with Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon both exiting Q2 in P11 and P14 respectively. It was also another tough outing for Yuki Tsunoda, who found himself down in P12 for Red Bull.

Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar took 13th place, with the Haas of Esteban Ocon the final car to miss out on the top 10 shootout in 15th.

There was drama in Q1 when Alpine's Franco Colapinto spun off into the barriers at the final corner, bringing out the red flags and leaving the Argentinian driver down in P20.

Also eliminated in the first segment of Qualifying – which saw the whole field barring Colapinto covered by just six-tenths – were Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson in 16th, the Kick Sauber duo of Gabriel Bortoleto and Nico Hulkenberg in 17th and 19th respectively and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll between them in 18th.

After three busy practice sessions – each featuring a different driver at the top of the timesheets – it was time for Saturday's highly-anticipated Qualifying session. Russell clinched pole at home in 2024, but who would put themselves at the front of the grid this time around?

Bortoleto was the first to hit the track as the green light signalled the start of Q1, the Kick Sauber team having repaired the car in time following the Brazilian's spin into the gravel during FP3. Conditions looked to be dry, but Gasly hinted at a change as he radioed in to report “some drizzle”.

As the rest of the pack started to emerge – all sporting the C4 soft tyres – Piastri went fastest during the early runs, his lap of 1m 26.002s putting him 0.039s clear of Verstappen in second and Alonso in third.

There was drama with just over eight minutes remaining as Colapinto had a moment at the final corner and spun into the barriers, bringing out the yellow flags. The Alpine driver initially got going again before then pulling off the track again near the pit exit, resulting in a red flag being thrown to allow for the Argentine's car to be recovered.

When the session resumed with six minutes and 49 seconds remaining, the drivers at risk were Bortoleto, Ocon, Hulkenberg, the stricken Colapinto and Gasly, with Tsunoda on the bubble in 15th place – while leader Piastri stated that the drops of rain seemed “worse than before”.

Albon improved to climb up to third, while Verstappen and Piastri swapped fastest laps at the top of the timesheets. Elsewhere Hamilton and Leclerc looked to potentially be at risk in P11 and P13, with Hamilton told that he did not have enough fuel remaining for another lap.

Leclerc went on to move himself up to ninth, while Hamilton was pushed to 14th but stayed out of the elimination zone and Sainz climbed to eighth. Others were not so lucky, however; Lawson exited in 16th, a contrast from his sixth place on the grid last time out in Austria.

The Kick Saubers of Bortoleto and Hulkenberg exited in P17 and P19 respectively, with Stroll sandwiched between them in P18 while the aforementioned Colapinto ended the segment in P20 following his accident. Colapinto aside, the entire field was covered by just six-tenths in an incredibly close Q1.

Knocked out: Lawson, Bortoleto, Stroll, Hulkenberg, Colapinto

After an initially quiet start, Verstappen led the field out as Q2 got underway at Silverstone. The Dutchman soon went fastest on a 1m 25.316s – before Piastri incredibly set the exact same time, going into P2 given that he set his time after Verstappen.

More was to come though from Norris, who beat both drivers by 0.085s to go to the top, a welcome sight to the fans watching on in his grandstand. Further back, Hamilton, Antonelli, Leclerc, Gasly and Tsunoda were the names at risk in the bottom five, all of whom had sported used tyres on their first runs.

Alonso, meanwhile, was left unimpressed after encountering a slow-moving Antonelli, the two-time World Champion calling the incident “crazy” before suggesting that the Italian – who already has a three-place grid drop from his Lap 1 crash in Austria – would receive a penalty.

As the segment entered its final minutes, everybody was back out on track in an effort to improve and get themselves into the top 10 shootout. The Scuderia cars bolted on fresh rubber for this run, enabling Leclerc to initially go fastest but Hamilton stormed to the head of the timesheets on a 1m 25.084s, just under five-hundredths clear of his team mate.

Despite moving up to 10th, Tsunoda found himself pushed down the order as others bettered their times, dropping the Red Bull driver down to 12th. Williams also faced disappointment as Sainz and Albon exited in 11th and 14th respectively, with a downbeat Albon reporting: “We made it difficult for ourselves.” Also out were Hadjar in P13 and Ocon in P15.

Knocked out: Sainz, Tsunoda, Hadjar, Albon, Ocon

After an action-packed build-up, attentions turned to the top 10 shootout at Silverstone, with the Ferrari, McLaren and Mercedes duos joined by Verstappen, Alonso, Gasly and Bearman, though the latter would drop down the order thanks to a 10-place grid penalty from a red flag infringement in FP3.

As the first laps went on the board, Piastri secured provisional pole position by pumping in a 1m 24.995s, while Hamilton proved to be his nearest challenger on a lap 0.135s adrift of the Australian. The other McLaren of Norris was third, with Verstappen and Leclerc following behind.

With the clock ticking down, the time arrived for the decisive final runs. Could Piastri hold on to score his fifth P1 grid slot of the year, or might Hamilton add a record eighth pole position at Silverstone to his name – and his first in general since the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix?

Piastri looked to be improving, but a mistake on his lap meant that the Australian could not better his previous lap. The likes of Norris, Hamilton and Leclerc were also unable to make improvements – but Verstappen put together a sublime lap to grab pole position, the Red Bull man going quickest thanks to his effort of 1m 24.892s.

This put him 0.103s clear of Piastri, while Norris had to settle for third. Russell moved up the order to take fourth, pushing Hamilton and Leclerc down to fifth and sixth respectively, while Antonelli claimed seventh, though the Italian will drop down three places after receiving a penalty last time out in Austria.

Bearman slotted into eighth but, like Antonelli, will not keep his original position owing to a grid drop, the Haas driver moving down 10 places. Alonso and Gasly, meanwhile, rounded out the top 10.

"It was tricky out there with the wind," said Verstappen. "Throughout the whole of Qualifying it was shifting around a bit, and around here with these cars they are extremely sensitive to it. Just tried to tidy it up throughout Qualifying and that final lap was good enough. This is a proper track in Qualifying, where you have to go flat-out on all these corners, you have to be really committed and that's really enjoyable."

The 2025 British Grand Prix is set to begin at 1500 local time on Sunday. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can catch the action from Silverstone.

Charles Leclerc topped the third and final practice session ahead of the British Grand Prix, which was disrupted by two red flags.

Charles Leclerc topped the third and final practice session ahead of the British Grand Prix, as the top three drivers were covered by less than one-tenth of a second.

The Ferrari driver posted a 1m 25.498s in much cooler conditions than Friday, which left him just 0.068s clear of Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen a further 0.019s back.

Drivers were unable to improve in the final moments at Silverstone following two red flags in quick succession, the first due to debris heading into Stowe that thwarted Lewis Hamilton's best effort as the Ferrari driver finished outside the top 10.

The second stoppage came at the very end of the one-hour session, Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto losing control through Maggotts and Becketts and finishing in the gravel with suspension damage, while Haas' Ollie Bearman hit the barrier on the entry to the pits.

2025 British Grand Prix: Norris crosses the line to take his first British Grand Prix victory

Ollie Bearman has been hit with a grid penalty following a red flag infringement during third and final practice at Silverstone.

Ollie Bearman has been handed a 10-place grid penalty for the British Grand Prix following a red flag infringement during the weekend's third and final practice hour.

The session had already proven eventful for Bearman, the Haas driver earlier sparking a red flag after losing a piece of bodywork from his car out on track which resulted in the marshals having to retrieve the part.

But there was worse to come for the Briton when a second red flag was thrown in the latter stages owing to Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto spinning off and becoming beached in the gravel.

As he headed into the pit lane, Bearman had a spin of his own and hit the barriers, losing the front wing from his VF-25 in the process.

With the incident happening under red flag conditions, it was subsequently investigated by the stewards who opted to hand the 20-year-old a grid drop of 10 places for Sunday's race.

A document released following the stewards' hearing reads: “Car 87 had slowed down for the red flag and as he was approaching Turn 15 accelerated significantly to race pace and entered the pit entry road at 260kph. He lost control of the car in the pit entry road and crashed into the barriers.

“Art. 37.6 (a) of the Formula One Sporting Regulations and Art. 2.5.4.1(b) of Appendix H of the International Sporting Code require that when a red flag is shown ‘all cars must immediately reduce speed and proceed slowly back to the pit lane'.

“It is beyond doubt that the driver of Car 87 did not proceed slowly back to the pit lane when he accelerated to simulate entering into the pit entry road under race conditions.

“In fact, we looked at a previous in-lap under normal racing conditions and found that he was faster in this lap, under a red flag.

“To make matters worse, he lost control of the car and crashed into the barriers while at speed. The driver informed us that he misjudged the fact that his brakes were not warm because the lap was done slowly, due to the red flag.

“While this may have been a factor contributing to the crash, we did not consider it to be a mitigating factor.”

As well as the grid penalty, Bearman has also received four penalty points, bringing the total on his licence up to eight.

The British driver is competing in his first home Grand Prix as an F1 driver, with last year's event at Silverstone being where the youngster's deal to race for Haas in 2025 was announced.

Plus: Lorde, KATSEYE and Russ debut in the top 10, while KPop Demon Hunters and Playboi Carti surge.

Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem rules the Billboard 200 albums chart (dated July 12) for a seventh consecutive, and total, week. The set earned 173,000 equivalent album units in the United States in the week ending July 3 — down a scant 3% compared to the previous week. The album opened at No. 1 on the May 31 chart.


	With 173,000 units earned, Problem lands the largest total for an album in its seventh week on the chart since Adele's 25 earned 194,000 in its seventh week nearly a decade ago (on the Jan. 23, 2016-dated chart).

	











	Also in the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200, Lorde's Virgin debuts at No. 2, the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack surges 8-3, KATSEYE's BEAUTIFUL CHAOS bows at No. 4, Playboi Carti's chart-topping MUSIC vaults 28-8 after its vinyl release and Russ' W!LD starts at No. 10.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new July 12, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on July 8. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

	











	Of I'm the Problem's 173,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending July 3, SEA units comprise 164,000 (down 3%, equaling 215 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it leads Top Streaming Albums for a seventh week), album sales comprise 7,500 (up 2% — it falls 7-11 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 1,500 (up 6%).


	Lorde achieves her fourth top 10 album on the Billboard 200 as her latest studio project, Virgin, debuts at No. 2. All four of her top 10s have also debuted inside the top five (as Virgin follows Solar Power, with a No. 5 debut and peak, 2021; Melodrama, No. 1, 2017, and Pure Heroine, No. 3, 2013). Virgin bows with 71,000 equivalent album units earned. Of that sum, album sales comprise 42,000 (it debuts at No. 1 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 29,000 (equaling 37.07 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it debuts at No. 6 on Top Streaming Albums) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.


Virgin's first-week sales were aided by its availability across eight vinyl variants (including two signed editions), a standard CD and a digital download. All versions contained the same tracklist. Lorde's vinyl sales added up to 31,000 — her best week ever on vinyl.


	The album was announced on April 30 and preceded by the Billboard Hot 100-charting track “What Was That,” which debuted and peaked at No. 36 on the May 10-dated chart (her highest charting song since 2017's “Green Light” hit No. 19). Lorde's Ultrasound Tour of North America and Europe launches on Sept. 17 in Austin, Texas.


	The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack surges 8-3 on the Billboard 200 in its second week on the chart — earning 62,000 equivalent album units (up 97%). Of that sum, SEA units comprise 56,000 (up 108%, equaling 77.42 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it jumps 10-2 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 4,500 (up 31%, it's pushed down 18-22 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 1,500 (up 24%).

	











	The set's haul of 77.42 million streams for its songs is the largest streaming week for a soundtrack in  nearly two years, since the Barbie soundtrack claimed 79.32 million on the Aug. 19, 2023-dated chart (its third week on the chart).


	With KPop Demon Hunters' 8-3 climb on the Billboard 200, it becomes the highest-charting soundtrack of 2025, and the highest-charting soundtrack to an animated film since Encanto spent nine weeks at No. 1 in 2022. (Previously among soundtracks in 2025, Wicked reached a No. 4 high in January, after debuting and peaking at No. 2 in December 2024.)


KPop Demon Hunters premiered on June 20 on Netflix alongside its soundtrack. In the tracking week ending June 29, KPop Demon Hunters jumped 6-2 in its second week on Netflix's Top 10 Movies in United States chart.


	KATSEYE claims its first top 10 album on the Billboard 200 with the No. 4 debut of its second project, BEAUTIFUL CHAOS. The pop group's five-song set opens with 44,000 equivalent album units earned. Of that sum, album sales comprise 30,000 (it debuts at No. 2 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 14,000 (equaling 21.36 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs; it bows at No. 47 on Top Streaming Albums) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.


	The album's first-week sales were bolstered by its availability across nine CD variants and four vinyl variants (one signed), all with the same audio but with packaging variations. All contained collectible paper ephemera, some randomized. It was also issued as a standard digital download album for purchase.


BEAUTIFUL CHAOS was announced on May 7 and the album's release was preceded by a pair of charting entries on the Hot 100: “Gnarly” (No. 90) and “Gabriela” (No. 94).

	











Karol G's Tropicoqueta falls 3-5 on the Billboard 200 in its second week (40,000 equivalent album units earned; down 29%), Wallen's chart-topping One Thing at a Time is pushed down 5-6 (nearly 40,000; up 7%) and SZA's former No. 1 SOS descends 4-7 (39,000; down 17%). Playboi Carti's former leader MUSIC jumps 28-8 with 35,000 (up 83%), following its release on vinyl (pressed on two variants). The album sold 16,500 copies in the tracking week (up 12,593%), largely from vinyl purchases.


Sabrina Carpenter's chart-topping Short n' Sweet slides 6-9 on the Billboard 200 with 33,000 equivalent album units earned (down 5%).


	Russ closes out the top 10 with the No. 10 debut of his latest album, W!LD, entering at No. 10 with 32,000 equivalent album units earned. The set marks his fourth top 10-charted effort. Of the new album's 32,000 units, album sales comprise 25,000 (it debuts at No. 3 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 7,000 (equaling 9.15 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.


W!LD was announced on March 18 and preceded by the radio-promoted track “Crazy,” which has reached the top 30 on the Rhythmic Airplay chart. The album's first-week sales were aided by its availability across three vinyl variants, three CD variants and three cassette variants (some signed), as well as a standard digital download. All contained the same tracklist, and all of the physical editions were exclusively sold via Russ' official webstore. There was also an expanded edition of the download album, sold via the webstore, that includes narration from the artist.

The HBO series ran from 2012 to 2017.

Lena Dunham said she now understands why the lack of diversity on her hit HBO show Girls was “really disappointing to people.”


	The coming-of-age comedy-drama, which ran for six seasons from 2012 to 2017, was previously criticized for its characters not accurately representing New York City's diverse population. The creator and star defended the series in 2012, saying she's “half-Jew, half-WASP” and wanted to avoid “tokenism in casting.”




	More than a decade after Girls first premiered, Dunham recently reflected on the show, telling The Independent, “I think one of the profound issues around Girls was that there was so little real estate for women in television that if you had a show called Girls, which is such a monolithic name, it sounds like it's describing all the girls in all the places. And so if it's not reflecting a multitude of experiences, I understand how that would be really disappointing to people.”

Girls, which also starred Allison Williams, Jemima Kirke, Adam Driver, Zosia Mamet and Alex Karpovsky, followed the lives of a group of young women in their early twenties as they navigated life, love and careers in New York City.


	Dunham added that she appreciated “the conversation around Girls” and that it helped her make sure her new show Too Much, which sees her serving as producer, writer and director, featured different perspectives and experiences.


	“The thing I have really come to believe is that one of the most important things is not just diversity in front of the camera, but it's diversity behind the camera,” she explained. “As a producer, one of my goals is to bring a lot of different voices into a position where they can tell their story.”

	











Too Much, which stars Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, follows New York workaholic Jessica, who moves to London planning on being alone following a breakup, only to meet Felix, who causes her to reconsider finding love again. The show debuts on Netflix July 10.

	Long established as an allegory for the immigrant experience, especially when viewed through the personal histories of Superman‘s comic book co-creators — second-generation Jewish immigrants Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster — DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn said his forthcoming film entry of Kal-El keeps in tune with the original 1938-created vision.


	“I mean, Superman is the story of America,” the Superman helmer told The Times U.K. in a new profile. “An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.”

	When asked how the blockbuster may be perceived in predominantly red versus blue states, especially amid prevailing anti-immigrant and refugee sentiment, Gunn responded, “Yes, it plays differently, but it's about human kindness and obviously there will be jerks out there who are just not kind and will take it as offensive just because it is about kindness. But screw them.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Releasing July 11 in theaters, David Corenswet stars as the iconic bespectacled superhero, depicted in the movie as an already established reporter at the Daily Planet dating Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan). When he gets drawn into conflict at home and abroad, the Man of Steel — and his trusty flying dog Krypto — must contend with swiftly shifting public opinion as tech billionaire Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult) spots an opportunity to ascend.


	“Yes, it's about politics,” Gunn said of his take. “But on another level it's about morality. Do you never kill no matter what — which is what Superman believes — or do you have some balance, as Lois believes? It's really about their relationship and the way different opinions on basic moral beliefs can tear two people apart.”


	While Gunn said the Warner Bros. Pictures movie aims to balance its message and fun family appeal, the ultimate goal is to tell a human story.


	“This Superman does seem to come at a particular time when people are feeling a loss of hope in other people's goodness,” the Guardians of the Galaxy director shared. “I'm telling a story about a guy who is uniquely good, and that feels needed now because there is a meanness that has emerged due to cultural figures being mean online.”

	











	He continued, “And I include myself in this. It is ad infinitum, millions of people having tantrums online. How are we supposed to get anywhere as a culture? We don't know what's real, and that is a really difficult place for the human brain to be. If I could press a button to make the internet disappear I'd consider it. And, no, I don't make films to change the world, but if a few people could be just a bit nicer after this it would make me happy.”

If half of Americans interpret 2 hours of a superhero being kind to others as a political attack on them, America is finished.

America is finished.

MAGA folk probably don't have the critical thinking skills to take away that thesis, Mr. Gunn. 

But I hear it's great and can't wait to see it!

Magas are going to be the complainers which shows their true character. They're soulless and have zero empathy for humankind.

lmao please. all you guys do is complain.

As you are.

Universe have mercy, get over yourself, Gunn.

I don't get a good vibe about this movie

Hope l am wrong

Trust your instincts.

When Michael Douglas semi-sprinted on to the stage of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival's Grand Hall to introduce the Czech premiere of the 50th anniversary screening (a restored print that also played at Cannes in May) of the late Czech American director Miloš Forman's iconic Academy Award winning film “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,” he joyfully took in the applause of the choc-a-block auditorium.

It had been 27 years since he was last at this postcard perfect spa town two hours west of Prague, which is currently hosting the 59th edition of the underrated Central European film festival. Back in 1998, Douglas and the film's other producer, the late Saul Zaentz (“The English Patient,” “Amadeus”) were honored with the Crystal Globe, the festival's highest award.

At the July 5 ceremony, as a heartwarming and funny gesture, KVIFF's Executive Director Kryštof Mucha presented Douglas with an updated Crystal Globe trophy — the newly designed one that forms the festival's logo, since the festival's former President, the recently passed Jiří Bartoška, had always thought an award should be easy to hold. (Douglas' previous one is disc-shaped.) Douglas quipped, “I've been upgraded.”

 










Also on stage and at the post-screening press conference was Paul Zaentz (“Ratched,” “The Talented Mr. Ripley”), Saul Zaentz's nephew, who spoke eloquently of the vision shared by Forman, Douglas, and his uncle that made the film possible. He apologized for coming a bit late to the press conference. It was his first time watching the film in Czechia, Forman's family was present in the audience, and he was so moved that he had to compose himself afterward.

“I'm probably biased, but I think Miloš Forman is one of the best directors in the history of cinema,” said Zaentz, who has been touring with the restoration, having just presented it at Bologna, Italy, and at the Academy in Los Angeles. The restored version will enjoy a theatrical release in the U.S. later this month.

On stage, Douglas, dressed in a beige jacket, commented on how he felt like “a painter, an artist,” indicating that for his first film as a producer — one that he made when he was better known as a TV actor (the hit series “The Streets of San Francisco”) — to have a 50th anniversary screening with a restored print on a meaningful world stage felt rare and special.

Many of the anecdotes exchanged were about the film's storied collaboration and of the decade-long, circuitous, and fortuitous path that led Forman to be hired by a then 29-year-old Michael Douglas. Douglas had just persuaded his father Kirk to sell him the rights to the film that the latter had bought more than a decade prior from Ken Kesey, who authored the book of the same name. After Kirk bought it, he starred in a flop Broadway adaptation and failed to generate any studio interest in producing the film, even though he was at the height of his popularity in the '60s after the massive success of “Spartacus.”

 










“My partner Saul Zaentz and I interviewed many directors, but we were frustrated by how close they kept their cards to their chests,” Michael Douglas said. When one of the film's co-writers, Larry Hauben, suggested the name of this recently emigrated Czech director, Douglas recalled he had never heard of Forman, nor of his breakout hit before he left Czechia, “The Firemen's Ball.”

Douglas and Saul Zaentz slowly began to see the similarities between the films. Both take place in a single room or location and have a large ensemble of characters. “Most importantly,” Douglas said, “was the sense of humor that Miloš found without laughing at people but just laughing with them. So we invited Miloš out to my house in California. Miloš opened the script to the first page and started specifically telling us what he was going to do, page by page. Saul and I said, ‘Thank god there's one person who is going to share with us the ideas.' Miloš went through the whole script, and I remember Saul and I hugging each other and saying, ‘We found our director!'”

At the July 5 events, Douglas more than once expressed his gratitude to his father Kirk for giving him the opportunity to re-develop and produce the film. Kirk was on the brink of giving up his rights when Michael told him, “Dad, please don't sell this. I never thought about being a producer, but I love this project so much.”

 










Interestingly, Douglas made no mention of how this handover tested the relationship between father and son for years to come, something that Kirk alluded to in an interview for the Guardian on his 100th birthday in 2017. Kirk had fully expected to be the film's lead, but Michael had to let him down saying that he was too old. Kirk had never heard of Jack Nicholson and said that the film would be a flop. (It actually went on to become the second highest-grossing film of 1975.) 

On another occasion, Michael said that he knew of his dad's version of the story — that Michael rejected him — and responded,  “Since when does the producer have casting control? That was the director.” In a 2005 HBO documentary “A Father, A Son: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” Kirk and Michael clashed again when Kirk said, “That's the picture when you destroyed me.” In the documentary, Michael laughs this off.

At Karlovy Vary, Douglas was far more interested in sharing more fun stories, a couple of which involved Nicholson. “Cuckoo's Nest” shares the distinction with just two other films — “It Happened One Night” (1934) and “The Silence of the Lambs” (1991) — to have won all five of the top Oscars: Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and its applicable Adapted Screenplay category. (“Anora,” for instance, won only four since it was not nominated for Actor.) Douglas recalled that Nicholson didn't want to be there since he had lost the two previous times he was nominated. Somehow Douglas convinced him. As the ceremony began, “Cuckoo” proceeded to lose the first four categories it was nominated for (it had a total of nine nominations). After each loss, Nicholson, who was sitting in front of Douglas, kept saying, “I told you so.” But once “Cuckoo” won Adapted Screenplay, the rest was history. (If you're interested in watching Nicholson's acceptance speech for Best Actor, you can watch it here.)

 










Later in the press conference, Paul Zaentz, who now holds the rights to “Cuckoo's Nest,” iterated a piece of news that had just dropped the previous day: The IP is being adapted into a TV series. Of the deal, Zaentz said, “We just made an arrangement with Ken Kesey's family to possibly do a television series, but it's based on the book, and the book is told through the eyes of [the famous Native American character] Chief Bromden. That's the way the TV series would be. At the end of the first year, Jack Nicholson's character would die. And the second year would be what happened to the Chief after he escapes.”

Upon hearing this, Douglas, who seemed to not have been in the know, said, “I just want to say, Paul, good luck on casting. It's not easy finding the Big Chief,” and proceeded to share a second hilarious Nicholson anecdote. Through a fortunate random encounter that Douglas had with a Native American man who had a used car dealership in Oregon, he was told about Will Sampson. When Saul Zaentz, Forman, Douglas, and Nicholson saw Sampson at the airport — nearly seven feet, wearing a cowboy hat and boots — Nicholson said (Douglas mimics a high-pitched voice), “Oh my god, it's the Chief, it's the Chief! He's perfect! Can he talk? Wait a minute, he doesn't have to talk!” [The character is deaf.] Later, on their flight in a tiny plane to a hospital in Eugene, Oregon, Douglas said he can't forget the image of Nicholson sitting on Sampson's lap, again going, “It's the Chief! I can't believe it.”

 










One of the questions at the presser was about how working on the film shaped Douglas and Zaentz's perspective on mental health, since it is such a buzzword today — perhaps not in the way it was in the '70s. Here, Zaentz made a somewhat surprising revelation. He shared that his late mother had suffered from depression for three decades and once tried to commit suicide. She was stopped before she could jump off a building and was taken to a hospital where the doctors recommended either lifelong institutionalization or electroconvulsive therapy. The doctor told him that the treatment had significantly improved and involved less electricity, among other changes. They agreed to it, and after a few treatments, his mother's depression was gone. Zaentz is now a proponent of this therapy, though it may feel outdated to many people today. But if people who want to adapt “Cuckoo's Nest” don't want to depict it, Zaentz said he will not agree to give them the rights.

Of course the largely Central European and Czech press wouldn't want the presser to end without getting Douglas' view of what's happening currently in the United States, especially since some couldn't help but see the parallels between “Cuckoo's” story and the political situation in the U.S.

Douglas — often outspoken — didn't dodge the question entirely and replied, “Let's just say that our president's name has been mentioned enough. I look at it generally as the fact how precious democracy is, how vulnerable it is, and how it always has to be protected. Right now, our country is flirting with autocracy, as [are] some other democracies in this world. I hope what we're struggling with now [helps us remember] all the hard work that the Czechs did. Democracy is not to be taken for granted. The disappointing thing is that politics now seems to be for profit. We maintained an idealism in the U.S. which does not exist now. The news speaks for itself. I am worried, I am nervous. And I just think it's about the responsibility not for someone else to look out for us but for us to look out for each other.”

 










Zaentz, as gentle and calm as his demeanor can be, pulled no punches in sharing his viewpoint on this matter, and in fact did so more publicly when he came on stage before Douglas. He powerfully provided a chronological comparison of the parallels between the political spirit of “Cuckoo's Nest” and the chilling institutionalization effect of 2025 America. 

“Recurring themes in Miloš' movies are individual freedom, and the struggle against oppression. ‘Cuckoo's Nest‘ is about rebellion,” Zaentz said. “It is one of the reasons why when I showed ‘Cuckoo's Nest' to the ‘Amadeus' crew in Prague in 1983, the next day I had a visit by the Czech secret police asking me, ‘Please don't show movies that are banned in Czechoslovakia.‘ It's ironic that 42 years later, ‘Cuckoo's Nest' is getting honored here on its 50th anniversary, and I'm afraid that Ken Kesey's brilliant book may be banned in the USA. We know what Nurse Ratched represents.”

Every couple sentences, the audience applauded and cheered.

Mincing no words about the so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill“ that was just signed into law, he continued: “Yesterday, July 4th, the malignant, narcissist, want-to-be dictator that occupies the White House signed a bill that was passed by his cruel heartless followers to make the rich richer and take food and health care away from the people who need it. A very sad July 4th for the USA.“

 










Zaentz ended with a plea. “Ken Kesey's book was written in 1962. In the 1960s in the United States we protested the Vietnam War and protested for civil rights. We had a slogan then, ‘We shall overcome.' Don't give up on America. We shall overcome the totally corrupt, morally bankrupt, treasonous evil thing and his cronies. I'm certain that Miloš would agree with me that Trump is a stain on my country and his presidency would be looked upon as the greatest moral failure in the history of the U.S.”

If Douglas showed how proud and moved he was by the honor bestowed by Karlovy Vary for the film that was so meaningful to film at the start of his career, Zaentz came closer to channeling the spirit of the Big Chief character in the film's final moments. As they both pointed out in different ways, it was deeply ironic how forcefully their words landed in Czechia and other countries behind the Iron Curtain that underwent tragic trials with communism. Miloš Forman fled from the region to seek his voice in America. One suspects that Douglas and Zaentz feel the most at liberty to speak away from the borders and snake nests of their home country.

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


SUNDAY UPDATE, Refresh for latest…: Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth has come in with a monster $318.3M global launch, making it the biggest worldwide opening of the year for a studio film so far. It's also got bragging rights to becoming the 2nd best start for the franchise, behind 2015's Jurassic World.


	In 82 offshore markets, the Gareth Edwards-directed Scarlett Johansson-starrer is estimated to gross $171M through today. That makes it the 2nd biggest international box office opener of 2025, behind China's Ne Zha 2 and the biggest for Hollywood. It's also the No. 2 best bow for the Jurassic franchise.

	











China leads all play at $41.5M for the five-day frame – this is the biggest studio movie opening of 2025, even when counting just the FSS. JWR has already outgrossed How to Train Your Dragon, A Minecraft Movie and Lilo & Stitch in the market and is currently the No. 2 2025 studio title there, only behind Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In UK & Ireland JWR dominated at No.1 with a 52% share, and $16.6M. That's just off Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, in line with Dune: Part II, and above Gladiator II and M:I 8. This is Universal's 5th No. 1 opening of the year.


	In Mexico, the new take on the series opened to $13.9M at No.1.  The launch weekend is on par with Minecraft, Jurassic World, JWFK and more than double Gladiator II, M: I 8 and Top Gun: Maverick.


Germany opened at No. 1 (49% share) with $7.6M, in line with Jurassic World Dominion, and above Maverick, Mufasa and M:I 8. 3D screenings accounted for a strong 46% share of the total admissions and contributed 51% of the overall box office. 


	In Korea, Mosasaurus & Co ranked at No. 1 (48% share), opening to $7.4M from the five-day release. This is the biggest opening of the year, surpassing previous record holder Mickey 17, and is the first title in 2025 to reach 1 million admissions on its debut weekend. The result is above M:I 8 and Dune 2, and more than double Minecraft and Mufasa.

	











	Rounding out the Top 10 markets are Spain ($6.5M), Australia ($5.9M), India ($5.5M/best of franchise), France ($5.3M) and Italy ($4.7M). In Imax, JWR generated $5.5M in China (14% of the total opening there). Japan releases on August 8.


	For more on how the weekend played out on this summer popcorn chomper, see previous updates below.


	Meanwhile, last weekend's champ,  F1, had an exceptional hold internationally, slowing by just 28%. The Apple Original Films title released by Warner Bros put another $56.3M in the tank from 78 overseas markets. That lifts the offshore cume to $184.1M as global closes in on the three-century mile marker with $293.6M through Sunday worldwide. 


	Notably, China dipped just 2% from last weekend, the best sophomore frame drop for a Hollywood movie of the year. Today was up 7% on last Sunday. Europe had a 32% drop, terrific given the strong opening and increased competition in the region, and Latin America held at -37% from opening weekend.


	Imax added $18.5M globally this frame, revving to over $60M worldwide and indexing at a mega 20.4% of the total. The international running cume is $32.6M.


	The Top 5 markets to date are China ($22M), UK ($17.3M), Mexico ($12.3M), France ($11.5M) and Australia ($9.8M). 


	In other holdovers, Universal's How to Train Your Dragon continues to soar, adding another $21M in the 4th weekend. The overseas cume is nearing $300M with $292.9M through today. Excluding China, this is above Sonic the Hedgehog 3, HTTYD3 and The Little Mermaid and only just below Aladdin at the same point.


	Globally, Toothless flew past the half-billion mark, reaching $517M. 


	The Top 5 offshore markets so far are China ($35.5M), Mexico ($33.4M), UK ($24.6M), Brazil ($17.2M) and France ($14.2M).


	Earlier this week, Disney's Lilo & Stitch overtook A Minecraft Movie to become the highest grossing studio movie year-to-date worldwide. This weekend, it added another $9.9M internationally. That brings the overseas cume to $564.2M and global to $972.7M.


	The offshore weekend drop was 30%; the Top 5 overseas markets are Mexico ($66.5M), UK ($48.3M), France ($40.5M), Brazil ($36.5M) and Germany ($30.8M).


	After topping $100M globally last weekend, Sony and Danny Boyle's 28 Years Later added $7M from 64 overseas markets this frame, bringing the international cume to $65.6M and worldwide to $125.8M. The UK leads all offshore play at $17M. 


	As for Pixar/Disney's Elio, the new IP is nearing $100M globally — through today, it's at $96.8M worldwide. The 3rd weekend added $6.7M in 48 material offshore markets (-43%), including solid holds in the UK (-15%), France (-17%), Germany (-18%), Australia (-20%) and Brazil (-20%). The running international cume is $41.7M.


	Tops to date are France ($4.7M), UK ($4.1M), Korea ($3.6M), China ($3.5M) and Mexico ($2.8M). 


	Still to come are Spain, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan.

	More to come throughout the weekend.


PREVIOUS, THURSDAY: Universal/Amblin Entertainment's Jurassic World Rebirth delivered a strong overseas start on Wednesday with $26M from 38 international box office markets, including some previews. Combined with domestic's $30.5M Wednesday, the global running total is $56.5M through Day One.


	In total, JWR will be out in 82 offshore markets this weekend with Japan joining in August. 


	International rollout began on Tuesday in Hong Kong to capitalize on the Special Administrative Region Establishment Day holiday, coming in with $600K — the single biggest day for a studio title since Deadpool & Wolverine‘s opening Saturday, and the biggest MPA opening of the year to-date. The Scarlett Johansson-starrer ranked as a clear No. 1 for the day, with a 44% market share.

	











	On Wednesday, China delivered the biggest launch day for a studio movie in the market this year at $9.9M. Opening on 65,000 screens in the market, including 760 Imax, the Gareth Edwards-directed adventure took a massive 64% share at No. 1. This is also the biggest studio opening day since Godzilla x Kong's Friday debut in March 2024 and the 2nd biggest MPA single-day gross of 2025, only behind Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning‘s first Sunday, which fell during the Dragon Boat Festival national holidays at release.


	On Thursday, China added a further $5.6M (not included in the offshore/global totals above), reaching $15.5M so far and continuing to dominate in a competitive market with a 50% market share at No. 1. 


	The Jurassic movies have been popular in China, with the recent titles grossing nearly $650M combined (unadjusted). The Rebirth team including Edwards, Johansson, Rupert Friend and Jonathan Bailey visited Shanghai for a premiere last Sunday – a promotional move that's become far less frequent since the pandemic. Jurassic also has a dedicated section at the Universal Beijing Resort.


	Meanwhile, Korea also opened yesterday, scoring the biggest Wednesday debut of the year at $1M and the 2nd biggest non-holiday opening day of 2025 after Bong Joon-ho's Mickey 17. The market grossed another $700K today (early estimate, not included in overall international and global totals above) and still a clear No. 1 with $1.7M through today.


	Other Wednesday debuts include the UK & Ireland with $2.7M, accounting for 56% of the market at No. 1. The performance is just off Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom‘s opening Wednesday, above Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and above Spider-Man: Homecoming. Relative to other 2025 tentpoles, this is more than double Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning and 72% above F1. 


Mexico debuted to $2.1M in wide Wednesday previews, taking a 67% market share for the day. Comparing to like-for-like wide Wednesday previews, this is above Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and aligned with Thor: Love and Thunder. 


Spain grossed $1.6M on Wednesday at a clear No. 1 with a 41% share. The launch is the second best opening day for any installment of the Jurassic World saga: above Fallen Kingdom and Dominion and just below Jurassic World, which opened on a standard Friday. This result was also the highest-grossing Wednesday of the year and the 3rd highest grossing day of 2025 (only behind Lilo & Stitch and Minecraft). 


Germany grossed $1.1M on Wednesday, taking a 52% market share at No.1, on what was the hottest day of the year so far. This is the biggest opening day of 2025, ahead of Lilo and Minecraft.


Italy is also off to a $1.1M start from Wednesday previews at a huge 60% market share for the day. Compared to standard Thursday openings for Jurassic titles, this is above Fallen Kingdom and in-line with Jurassic World.  


Thailand, the production home for the film, opened on Wednesday to $700K, dominating close to 75% market share in the key cities at No. 1 and delivering the biggest non-holiday opening day of the year in the market. 


Taiwan grossed $600K on Wednesday, marking the biggest opening day of 2025, and accounting for 50% of the market at No. 1.

	











Indonesia opened on Wednesday at No. 1 to $600K, best of the year so far in the market and the 2nd biggest opening day of the Jurassic franchise, coming in above Dominion and Jurassic World, and just below Fallen Kingdom. This is also Universal's second biggest opening of the last 5 years, only behind Fast X.


	As for other early Thursday results not included in the international and global totals above, Australia grossed $1.2M on opening day with JWR ranking as a clear No. 1 with a 54% share of the Top 10.  This is the biggest opening day of 2025, surpassing A Minecraft Movie.


Malaysia entered the fray with $400K, the biggest non-holiday opening day for an MPA title this year, more than double Lilo & Stitch and 48% above Minecraft.


	Other major Thursday openers include Brazil and Netherlands while France and India join on Friday.

Heardly gonna outgross Avatar lol

Wow, you “flop”sters are getting desperate. Oh no, it's not going to outgross AVATAR!! Here's a tip: Very few movies will. Doesn't mean REBIRTH isn't a success.

Good lord it's bad. I hope Gareth doesn't get anymore movies. Pace was so slow and so much air in the scenes. Writing was also horrific.

Writing horrific. A money grab. Insulted the audience with its nonsensical turns. 

Gareth will keep working. Just ask David O Russell. Losses $100 million for a studio and gets right back to work….

F1 is one of the most expensive films ever made and its not going to come close to the 100 highest grossing films of all time.

Shouldn't a 300 million budget film(not counting marketing) have to actually make money at the box office in order for you to proclaim it's a ‘hit'?😆

Agree. Hollywood has 2 wait 6 months stil Avatar 3

And that's why they are already working in a sequel.
Total hit. 

PS – the budget was just over $200 million…they surpassed the budget in 4 days.

That's not how it works. You left out marketing costs, plus they keep only about half the box office. If the production budget was really only 200m (doubtful) it would need 600m to break even.

Apple is desperate for content which also accounts for the expensive show Invasion that keeps getting renewed even though nobody watches it.  

Apple doesnt need hits as much as they need content.  

P.S. remember when a sequel to Brad's World War Z was gonna happen too then fell apart because it goy too expensive and the 1st didnt make enough money?😆

After 20 years and 17 seasons, it's tough to imagine a world where “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” isn't on television, but there was a point where one member of its reliable ensemble — which consists of Charlie Day, Glenn Howerton, Rob McElhenney (aka Rob Mac), Kaitlin Olson, and Danny DeVito — almost bowed out. At the July 1 PaleyLive 20th anniversary panel (via People), Howerton revealed that prior to the start of Season 12, which broadcast on FXX in 2017, he told the creative team, “Look, I just don't want to wear out our welcome.”

 










“I was worried that maybe we had sort of peaked or something, and I just was like, you know, we've been doing this for a long time. And I think I was also anxious,” Howerton said. “I had not figured out yet how to stretch myself and be able to do other things that I wanted to do with my career outside of the show… I just hadn't figured out how to do that yet. I was aching to do other things, and so I was starting to feel a little boxed in, frankly.”

The cast was insistent, saying that they did not want the show to end. He simply said, “Oh, well I can't stop you.” “And then Seasons 13 and 14, I came back as an actor but I wasn't in the writers' room.”

Howerton had made appearances in many other series, including “The Mindy Project” and “Fargo,” but after he “figured out how to do that” — meaning juggle additional projects — he would take on such hefty assignments as the sitcom “A.P. Bio” and films like “The Hunt” and “Blackberry.” Meanwhile, “It's Always Sunny” kept going, and so did he.

“[They] just kept writing it and kept writing him in,” McElhenney said, the show's official creator. “And we're like, he's just gonna eventually say he's coming back. That's what happened.”

“It's Always Sunny” will drop its first two episodes of its 17th season, which will contain eight episodes, on July 9. Its season premiere will include the highly-anticipated second part of a crossover event with fellow Philadelphia-set sitcom “Abbott Elementary.” An episode of that series with guest appearances from the entire “Sunny” cast aired on ABC in January.

At the Karlovy Vary film fest, the star also discusses measuring success in ways other than box office and how her TeaTime Pictures tells female-centric stories that are "provocative" and "different."


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Dakota Johnson (Fifty Shades of Grey, Black Mess, Suspiria) is likely to direct her first feature based on a script by an autistic actress she has acted with in a film, wants to continue telling female-centric stories through her TeaTime Pictures, avoid “toxic sets,” measure the success of movies in terms of viewer impact rather than box office and would love to play a psychopath and an action role, the actress said on Sunday.


	Asked by reporters during a press roundtable at the 59th edition of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (KVIFF) in the Czech Republic about whether she will move beyond acting and producing into directing, Johnson replied: “I think I will direct a feature, a very small one, hopefully soon. And it's really close to my heart and very close to TeaTime. We're making it with Vanessa Burghardt, who played my daughter in Cha Cha Real Smooth. She's an incredible autistic actress.”

	The star shared: “I've always felt that I'm not ready to direct a feature. I don't have the confidence. But with her, I feel very protective, and I know her very well, and … I just won't let anybody else do it.”

	As a director, Johnson has already made the Coldplay music video “Cry Cry Cry” and the short film Loser Baby.


	What attracts her interest when picking TeaTime projects? “Usually, it's something that is either visually or emotionally provocative. And I don't mean that in a sexual way. I mean it in [the sense] that it provokes something that is different than what you see on TV right now or on streaming platforms. A lot of them are also female characters. So it's female-centric films where the woman is different from what you see, and complex and nuanced, and maybe an anti-hero that you love.” Projects could even feature a woman “who maybe does things that you would deem atrocious, but you are really on her side because she's angry” and real, Johnson explained.

	











	Producing has the benefit that she can surround herself with people who create a positive work experience. “I can't waste time on toxic sets anymore,” Johnson said. “With producing, that's one of the perks.” 


	She told reporters that she was “pretty vocal” when issues arose on set or beyond from a very young age. “Now, … being a producer and developing my own films, I can choose all the people.”


	The star also called for new ways to measure the success of movies. “I think that the barometer for that is shifting right now. It's hard to measure success based on box office numbers now, because it's so all over the place,” she offered. Mentioning that Jurassic Park Rebirth has “slayed,” she said that, “the way I measure success is [in terms of] people who felt something or it meant something to them” — or people coming up to her in the street and telling her that they loved a film.


	Johnson made time for meeting the press before receiving the KVIFF President's Award on Saturday evening before a screening of her new film Materialists, which was directed by Celine Song and also stars Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans.


	The second film that Johnson presented at KVIFF is the Michael Angelo Covino-directed romantic comedy Splitsville, which she also produced under her TeaTime Pictures banner, launched in 2019 with her producing partner Ro Donnelly.


	Are there any types of characters she'd love to take on in the future? “There are roles that I dream of playing,” Johnson shared. “I would love to play a psychopath, would love to do an action film.”

	











	Johnson also shared that “I love coming to film festivals, just because everyone loves movies so much, and it feels like a magical little bubble in a world full of chaos and pain.” She added: “I think art can really reach people, and so, … festivals in places like this make me feel inspired and hopeful.”


	Concluded Johnson: “It's really hard to make movies right now and to get people to believe in what you want to say. I don't think movies will save the world, by no means, but I do think it's nice to have them around.”


	Johnson made her film debut at age 10 in Antonio Banderas' 1999 movie Crazy in Alabama. In 2010, she appeared in David Fincher's The Social Network. Her recent credits have included the likes of Maggie Gyllenhaal's The Lost Daughter (2021) and Carrie Cracknell's Persuasion (2022). She next stars in Amazon's Michael Showalter-directed romance thriller Verity, opposite Anne Hathaway and Josh Hartnett.


	“Dakota Johnson continues her family's multigenerational acting tradition, as represented by her grandmother Tippy Hedren and both of her parents, award-winning Hollywood stars Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson,” festival organizers had highlighted when they unveiled that she would visit the picturesque Czech spa town to receive the honor.

Michael Douglas has revealed that while he's not officially retired from acting, he has “no real intentions” of returning to the big screen.


	Speaking at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival to present a newly restored print of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest — which he won an Oscar for as a producer on the 1970 classic — the 80-year-old Douglas was asked about his future plans as an actor. 


	“I have not worked since 2022 purposefully because I realized I had to stop,” Douglas said (via Variety). “I had been working pretty hard for almost 60 years, and I did not want to be one of those people who dropped dead on the set. I have no real intentions of going back. I say I'm not retired because if something special came up, I'd go back, but otherwise, no.”


	Douglas last appeared on the big screen in 2023's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and starred 2024's Franklin, an Apple TV+ biographical series about Ben Franklin; both projects finished filming three years ago, and Douglas hasn't worked in front of the camera since.

	The actor did hint at “one little independent movie” he is “trying to get a good script out of,” but besides that project, he has no other plans to return to films, and is “happy to play the wife” to Catherine Zeta-Jones. “I am happy for Catherine to go to work – and she is very busy,” he said.


	The topic of Douglas' future came up after the actor discussed his battle with tongue cancer, with Douglas saying his course of action allowed him another decade of roles. “Stage 4 cancer is not a holiday, but there aren't many choices, are there? I went with the program, involving chemo and radiation, and was fortunate,” Douglas said, adding that his friend and actor Larry Hagman died from a similar diagnosis. “The surgery would have meant not being able to talk and removing part of my jaw and that would have been limiting as an actor.”

For all of the Hallmarkies dreaming of being swept off their feet by a Hallmark Channel hunk in real life, actor Jack Wagner just provided a glimmer of hope that it's possible.

In a social media video shared by Parade on July 2, 2025, The “When Calls The Heart” star, who just began filming his 13th season as Bill Avery on Hallmark Channel's hit series, revealed that his new wife, Michelle Wolf, considers herself one of countless “Hearties” — the nickname for the show's devoted fans.

Wagner, who rose to fame in the 90s and 2000s on daytime soap operas including “The Bold & the Beautiful” and primetime dramas like “Melrose Place” before moving over to Hallmark, married Wolf on May 18, per Swooon. 

Among the things they have in common is their experience as professional musicians (he had hit songs in the 80s and she has written songs for and performed with numerous acts including N*Sync, Oleta Adams, BB King, and The Scorpions, according to her website. Another common bond they share is her love of “When Calls The Heart,” which he's starred in since it premiered in 2014. 

“She watches ‘When Calls The Heart,'” Wager, 65, told Parade. “She's a Heartie. They're called Hearties. So I'm able to measure the show by watching Michelle, my wife now.” 

Sitting on his couch during the virtual interview, he pretended Wolf was sitting next to him and said, “Like, if I'm here watching and she's there, like, I can literally, like, I'll watch her and her reaction … ‘Ah! Oh my god!' You know? Because she's totally engaged as a normal person.”

Wagner continued, “I can't watch shows as a normal person, right? I think technically and, ‘What could happened here?” and ‘What could have been better?' You know, she watches as a normal person, okay?” 

The actor noted that they have never sat down together to watch “The Bold and the Beautiful,” which he returned to for a story arc in June. 

“Maybe she'll record it and maybe we'll have some time to check out some of those episodes, and see how she reacts to that,” he told Parade. “But she's fully invested in ‘When Calls The Heart' in terms of how it moves people and touches people.” 

The news of Wagner's wedding came as a big surprise to fans when Wolf shared Instagram photos on May 31, as initially reported by EntertainmentNow. In Wolf's pics, she and Wagner were beaming — with him in a tuxedo and her in a wedding dress and veil. 

Images included them laughing at an outdoor altar as the priest marrying them looked on, and of them posing at a small reception with a bar behind them.

She has since made her account private, but she previously posted periodically about dating Wagner on her account. However, the two never announced publicly that they were engaged and have kept a low profile. They did, however, attend the MovieGuide Awards in February 2024, as seen in the video above. 

Wagner returned to the Vancouver set of “When Calls The Heart” on July 1, posting a video from the airport in his Instagram Stories — as he does every summer — to thank Hearties for another season. He's not the only newlywed in the cast, though. Series lead Erin Krakow and co-star Ben Rosenbaum also got married in a surprise wedding in June.

It's been a tumultuous month since “Doc” star and Hallmark Channel fan favorite Scott Wolf and his wife, former MTV “The Real World” star Kelley Wolf, announced that they were divorcing after 21 years of marriage.  

The Wolfs' divorce news took fans by surprise on June 10, 2025, but even more shocking was how quickly circumstances spiraled after their separate announcements, from Kelley's detainment by police to Scott being granted temporary custody of their kids. With multiple court decisions due in early July, the coming days will be highly consequential for the former couple and their family. Here's the latest…

Kelley was the first to announce her and Scott's impending divorce, sharing the news in an Instagram post on June 10. He then followed with his own statement to People on June 11, calling it the “hardest decision” he'd ever made to file for divorce. In a stunning twist, Kelley was detained by police on June 13 and placed under an involuntary hold at a local mental health hospital, she later confirmed.

Then, on June 26, Today.com reported, a Utah judge granted Scott temporary sole custody of their kids — Jackson, 16, Miller, 12, and Lucy, 11. The judge also issued a temporary restraining order requiring that Kelley have no contact with Scott, their kids, or his brother Michael.

A custody hearing was scheduled for July 1, per Us Weekly, to decide if Kelley could have supervised parent time and to discuss any financial matters. Those discussions have not been made public. Meanwhile, the restraining order remains in effect until July 9, according to the outlet, unless a judge makes changes before then.

A post shared by KELLEY WOLF (@kelleywolf)

Kelley, who's worked for years as a certified life coach, has shared dozens of Instagram Stories and posts since her release from the hospital in late June, insisting that she is doing well. She initially stayed at a Park City resort while Scott traveled with their kids. 

She eventually returned to their family's home, which the restraining order said Scott and the kids had exclusive use of, per Us Weekly. Sharing videos in her Instagram Stories, she filled her SUV with some of her belongings and the family's dogs with the help of friend Josef Kirk Myers, who spent several days with her. 

Kelley wrote in multiple Instagram Stories that she was heading to European cities like Paris and Spain, but has spent the last week at a Utah cabin she posts from frequently, writing on June 29, “I am at a friends place now and eating her food and they are making me laugh.” 

In a couple of videos, she has shown videos or photos of people cooking for her or delivering food, but covered their faces because they asked not to be shown on camera. In a post on July 4, she wrote that “peace is a state of mind” and that she is “ready to begin again.”

Wearing the same floral skirt and plaid flannel shirt she'd been seen in several days of a videos, Kelley posted in her Stories on July 3, “I feel like I just had, I don't even know, 10 people, and now I'm alone, and we all know how much I like to just relax, listen to music. So, ready? Yes, I have not changed my clothes in a few days.” 

On July 5, she excitedly posted several Instagram Stories about a friend named Angela Stem coming to visit her. She posted videos of herself shopping for groceries, writing that her heart was racing about her friend visiting, and later posted a photo of a charcuterie board on the deck. 

Kelley did not share any visuals of her friend, but the Arkansas native wrote in her Stories, “This is my Arkansas happiness…we love good food…good music. Quiet and good people…but we know how to do this… Let's go baby! Angela is here!!!” Stem has made her Instagram profile private.

The "Back to the Beginning" send-off in Birmingham, England, was a fitting finale for the heavy metal band that changed everything.


													By
												

	Tom Morgan



	Every end is just another beginning. As its evocative title suggests, Black Sabbath and their many famous friends' stacked one-day show, here in Birmingham's Villa Park stadium, is intended to bring the band's story to a close back where it all began: their beloved hometown. The four-piece's legacy is intrinsically tied to the city in England's Midlands, whose endless sprawl of factories once produced what Black Sabbath came to define: heavy metal.


	The band made their final appearance on Saturday (July 5), under the banner of their original, “classic” lineup (Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Bill Ward), and boast a legacy that's almost impossible to quantify. They are the ground zero of heavy music, the big bang from which every metal subgenre and major act within it was birthed. As the great musicians here today continuously attest, across the course of their short and sweet sets (which all range from around 15 to 40 minutes in length): None of them would exist if it weren't for Sabbath and their music.


	45,000 fans descended on Villa Park (home to Ozzy's beloved Aston Villa F.C.) to witness this final communion, whose proceedings are entirely being donated to a range of charities, including Birmingham Children's Hospital. The imposing, traditionally designed stadium makes for suitably grand staging for the day's proceedings and proves a smart marrying of two of the city's key cultural touchstones. Ahead of various other large summer gigs and their opening of a nearby 3,500-capacity named The Warehouse; Saturday's proceedings affirm the location's stature as a top-tier events space and a worthy host of this pilgrimage.


	While “Back to the Beginning” and its dense array of talent on display proves to be a head-spinning feast of metal and rock music, an air of poignancy also hangs over the latter-stage proceedings. Knowing this is Sabbath and Ozzy's final performances (the latter is managing a number of health issues) imbues it with an end of an era feel, although, as the show's multi-layered title might suggest: heavy metal will continue, but forever situated in the shadow of Black Sabbath's titanic contributions.


	Here are nine of the best moments from “Back to the Beginning” at Villa Park:


	Saturday was all about paying tribute to Black Sabbath and every single act on the bill performed at least one cover track. Openers Mastodon (who decried that the ensuing day will be the “greatest metal show of all time”) started the trend off in spectacular fashion with their rendition of “Supernaut.” Drummer Brann Dailor handled lead vocals and did a great job of matching the famous depths of power that Ozzy summons up on that Sabbath classic. The track's closing stretch was filled out by some additional on-stage percussion from members of Gojira and Tool, setting the tone for a day of covers, collaborations and white-hot metal performances.


	The monster lineup of “Back to the Beginning” celebrated metal in all its forms, from blues revivalists to thrash legends to gnarly modern masters. Lamb of God fall firmly in the latter bracket. Their intense groove metal is as anthemic as it is razor-edged, and their mid-afternoon set drags Villa Park to new levels of intensity. Frontman Randy Blythe stalked the stage like a hungry hyena, inciting countless mosh pits and thanking the four Sabbath members for “inventing metal.” Ending with the strange sight of Blythe throwing both of his shoes into the crowd, Lamb of God's set is as short, head-spinning and satisfying as a quick pull on an illicit cigarette.


	One of the night's low-key heroes was Extreme guitarist Nuno Bettencourt who, between his shifts in various supergroup performances, spent more time onstage than any other musician. He joined Sleep Token drummer II and Yungblud for a rendition of Sabbath's “Changes,” an emotionally resonant ballad that feels tailor-made to be belted out by the expressive, charismatic Yungblud. This writer happened to be in the same location as Sharon Osbourne during the performance of the track and can confirm it reduced her to floods of tears. Given the song's reflective, personal lyrics and the famous latter-day version featuring her and Ozzy's daughter Kelly, it's not hard to see why she – and the rest of us – would have found it a deeply poignant listen.


	The first of many legendary musician supergroup team-ups saw a rare two-track appearance by ex-Ozzy solo guitarist Jake E. Lee. Accompanied by the likes of Faith No More's Mike Bordin on drums and Megadeth's Dave Ellefson on bass, he entered the stage to enormous applause from both the crowd and his bandmates, and looked a little overwhelmed by the acclaim. In October 2024, Lee was shot in a random act of violence and placed in intensive care, but rallied back to the stage. The fondness wasn't extended to Disturbed frontman David Dramian, who was repeatedly booed whenever addressing the crowd during his brief stint onstage, before meekly departing. Google is your friend if you're wondering what might have elicited this reaction.


	The second supergroup slot involved a truly dizzying number of musicians intertwining with one another across an array of cover songs. The opening section of this fascinating, fun stretch of the show was a particular highlight. Blink-182's Travis Barker, Tool's Danny Carey and Red Hot Chili Peppers' Chad Smith accompanied Tom Morello and others in a deconstructed version of Sabbath's “Symptom of the Universe,” taking it in turns to bust out fiery solos. Barker pulled out his usual tricks, but it was Smith and his tiny (compared to Carey's) kit which proved an intuitive delight to watch.


	Toward the end of the aforementioned second supergroup slot, a stellar lineup that includes Chad Smith, Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello and Aerosmith's Steven Tyler came together for Led Zeppelin's “Whole Lotta Love” and Aerosmith's “Walk This Way.” Tyler put in a fantastic performance, exuding presence and swagger that sparked widespread admiration. Later in the evening, Guns ‘N' Roses' Axl Rose also silenced his critics. His sometimes patchy live performances are well-documented, however he was in note-perfect, energetic form, particularly during a great cover of “Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,” far from the easiest vocal performance to emulate. 


	Palpable excitement coursed through the air prior to Metallica's arrival. Opening with a solid, if un-spectacular cover of “Hole in the Sky,” their set immediately shifts into fifth gear with a one-two punch of “Creeping Death” and “For Whom the Bell Tolls.” The four-piece seem extremely up for it, bouncing around the stage, pulling out all the signature moves (from bassist Robert Trujillo's crab walking to drummer Lars Ulrich's gurning) and ripping through these iconic songs with such effortless élan you'd think they were in their practice room. not a stadium. By the time they finish the solid-as-granite masterpiece that is “Master of Puppets,” Villa Park was crackling with paroxysms of delight.


	The time had come for the prince of darkness to reclaim his throne. Seated at the front of the stage in an ornate black chair (atop of which is, of course, a giant bat), Ozzy Osbourne explained to his feverish audience: “I've been laid up for six f—ing years, you have no idea how much this means to me.” His words surmise the tone of this set, which saw him give five of his finest solo tracks a run out.


	He might not be able to stand, but his voice sounds immaculate, still possessing that signature volume and heft, which drives the energetic likes of “I Don't Know” and “Crazy Train.” Along with the frail and grateful Ozzy, another surprisingly moving sight is that of grizzled longtime guitarist Zakk Wylde stood by his side like a faithful old guard dog, or perhaps the devil's favorite minion.


	Of course, we end where it started. Black Sabbath's original lineup (Ozzy, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward) took to the stage together for the first time since 2005, for a half-hour set that opened with “War Pigs,” followed by “N.I.B.” and “Iron Man,” before closing with “Paranoid.” 


	Interestingly, it's bassist Butler who put on the most eye-catching performance, reminding the world of his stature as one of rock's all-time great bass players. By the time they reached “Paranoid,” you sensed that the legends didn't have much left in the tank. However, following Ozzy's request to “go f—ing crazy,” a plethora of mosh pits open throughout the crowd. It's short and sweet and absolutely monumental; a final explosion of metallic sound from four epochal musicians whose influence is impossible to quantify. This spectacular event did them justice and poignantly suggested that every end is merely another beginning.

Rahul Purini also spoke about the company's co-production strategy and what challenges remain for bringing anime to Western audiences: "That discovery piece is the biggest thing."

	Enter the buzzing showfloor at this year's Anime Expo, and you'll be met with the towering exhibitor presences of MAPPA, SEGA, Netflix, TOHO Animation, HULU, Viz Media, Aniplex, and more major players in a rapidly popularizing (and globalizing) anime industry. But even among the industry's recognizable players, Crunchyroll — and its series of showfloor experiences, merchandising, and photo-ops — calls back to the heyday of the convention circuit in a way few others do. 


	The massive booth features a mass of large screens that deliver trailer takeovers and anime ambiance sequences that act as an environmental backdrop alongside an “Anime Forecast,” a series on interactive screens where fans can browse the company's catalog of upcoming titles. There's of course a merch store to pick up collectables, manga, vinyls, clothing, and more, but there's also the “trash to treasure” dumpster dive experience that introduces you to the characters and story of its upcoming graffiti-infused anime Gachiakuta as well as the Demon Slayer – Infinity Castle activation setting up the film trilogy's release.

	Inside, attendees move through an immersive set deco recreation of the Infinity Castle before interacting with a motion sensor experience that soars through the alternate dimension via the Crow, and a 3D photo-op that uses swords to simulate the breathing techniques (Water, Flame, Wind, Stone and Thunder) of key characters. This immersive activation helps make Crunchyroll's floor presence one of the Expo's biggest and most technologically advanced booths, and it's every bit a part of the company's strategy, says president Rahul Purini.

	Like the day-long pop-up convention hub Crunchyroll Stage and the Crunchyroll Lounge where onsite deals are made, the booth is a must-have — even if some of Crunchyroll's competitors have pulled back in certain corners of the convention circuit after launching their own events. “Fans love experiences, and this [booth], that's what we are creating here. It's not just some of our store. It is a small amusement park. You can go interact with the characters, or touch the stories and find yourself immersed in that. And we're trying to do that in places where the fans are already gathered,” he explains. 


	Crunchyroll's ongoing lean into the fan space doesn't stop at the showfloor. Across the July 4 holiday weekend, the media and entertainment company featured a number of panels and screenings, and on Saturday, shared a steady stream of acquisition and trailer announcements. Among them, exclusive footage of Studio KAI's dark fantasy Sentenced to Be a Hero, which sees criminals sentenced to heroism/service in a penal military unit waging war against a demon king's army, and the news that Studio Pierrot's Black Clover will return for an all-new season only on Crunchyroll, alongside a teaser trailer, key visual, a message from the manga's creator Yuki Tabata celebrating the anime's return and manga's 10th anniversary. 


	Other news included a trailer for the newly announced anime adaptation of Daemons of the Shadow Realm based on a manga created by Hiromu Arakawa (Fullmetal Alchemist); confirmation of Re:ZERO – Starting Life in Another World season four streaming exclusively on Crunchyroll in 2026; and a two-minute first-look at the upcoming third season of Studio Bind's Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation; the October 2025 premiere of action comedy Tojima Wants to Be a Kamen Rider and January 2026 drop of romantic comedy You and I Are Polar Opposites. Classroom of the Elite fans will get a follow-up to season three, titled Classroom of the Elite 2nd Year, and the game Classroom of the Elite – Merge Puzzle Special Exam, playable for the first time outside of Japan via Crunchyroll's Game Vault, with Hiroyuki SAWANO LIVE [nZk]008 set to join Crunchyroll's library of over 100 full-length concerts later this summer.

	











	Ahead of Saturday's panel, The Hollywood Reporter spoke to Purini about the company's presence at the con and its current season, what he's most excited about in this moment of anime expansion, what challenges remain for those bringing the medium to western audiences, and key growth areas for the company. 


You've brought so much to the convention this weekend. What are you most excited about in terms of your slate? 


	Our July season is among one of the biggest seasons that we've ever had. The volume, the breadth and the depth of content that we are able to bring to fans around the world, and the diversity of the content, is one thing we're really excited about. There are shows for every kind of anime fan. There's a show that premiered over the weekend, Lord of Mysteries, which is a Chinese animation show — there's not a lot of that. But the biggest anime show in Japan, Gachiakuta, which we are featuring here, is a show that I'm really excited about. It is from our partners at [Japanese publisher] Kodansha, and it is one of those shows where, if you watch the trailer, you're hooked. This kind of breadth and depth of show not only makes this season really, really compelling, it also talks to where we Crunchyroll are as a company. We have the single largest library of anime content anywhere. We have something for every fan, every genre, and we are adding a ton every quarter. That speaks to the value proposition for the anime fan when they come to Crunchyroll.

	











You worked at Funimation before heading up Crunchyroll, so you understand what the lift of making anime accessible to U.S. audiences was in those early days before places like Hulu and Netflix were also doing it. What was the biggest challenge then and what's the biggest challenge now in terms of bringing this content to audiences? 


	Early on, the biggest challenge Crunchyroll and other companies that were serving this fan base solved was accessibility. There was anime fandom around the world, but it was hard to get your hands on it, even as your peers in Japan were watching and enjoying it [sooner]. That was the biggest thing that most companies, including Crunchyroll and Funimation, solved. When the shows are happening in Japan, bring them globally, subtitle them so it becomes accessible. In the case of Funimation, innovate to even dub it during the season. We call it the simuldub, where now dubs are available one episode at a time within two to four weeks. But those were the initial challenges: accessibility, getting the shows from Japan and making them available to fans so they weren't waiting for 15 to 18 months for a DVD release or for some TV channel to pick up a show. 


	The challenges now are somewhat similar, except it's a global audience. The audience is growing, and when the audience is growing, you need a diverse slate of content to serve that audience. So making sure we have that diverse slate for the audience that's global, and making it accessible to them — that we're on all the devices that they want to watch, we have all the payments that they want to use to sign up for it, all the languages that they want to watch it in whether it's subtitled or dubbed, and making it available when they want to watch it. The second part of that is, given the volume of content, how do we make sure that we find the right content for the right fan at the right time. That discovery piece is the biggest thing that we are trying to solve because there's so much new content. How do we make fans aware of what's available, and serve as that connection. 

	











Platforms and streamers who more recently entered the anime market have increasingly found ways to blend it with Western animation or use American audience influences a little more in the visuals and storytelling. Can you talk about how your approach to your content slate is different, and how you tap into this medium that is outside the realm of Western storytelling to deliver for audiences? 


	There are a few things that are really core to us, what we call our guiding principles. We believe anime is intrinsically connected back to Japan. For anime to be authentically anime, it has to be conceived and created by Japan, and we take that to heart. There is other animation that might be anime-inspired, but it's not anime unless it has the connection. Second is that anime is a medium. It's not a genre. There is anime for various kinds of people — there's action, romance, slice-of-life, sci-fi, fantasy. It's an art form, and that's important to understand. One of the ways that I think we have operated and we believe we can successfully serve the anime fan is being singularly focused on that. This is not one genre that we serve the fan. This is our entire existence. So that focus and that clarity of what is authentically anime, and that relationship with partners, that relationship with the fans, and understanding why fans connect with anime, all of those things allow us to be able to serve those creators and fans in the best way. 


Crunchryoll is now many things, but first it was largely a content library. Many streamers started that way as well, and then expanded. Where is Crunchyroll in that conversation? How much do you want original content? How do you want to do it?












	First, we do not consider ourselves to be a streamer. We consider ourselves to be a media and entertainment company focused on serving the anime fan. The video content is a big part of that fandom but this is much bigger than that. It's everything from the real-world experiences, the community, the connection, the games, the merchandise, the manga, the music. We're not interested in being something for everyone. We want to be everything for someone. So that's number one. In terms of how we think about content, I go back to the amazing storytellers and partners in Japan. We want to work with them all, we want all of their content to be available to consumers, and we will continue to do that. Having said that, the audience around the globe is expanding. To serve them, we need more funding and more diverse content. So we're doing co-productions, where we go to Japanese partners and help them fund shows by investing in them. This is not distributing, not licensing. We're actually part of the production committee that's making these shows. 


	In addition to that, when we find stories around the world that we think are going to be great, we're now starting to take the stories back to the Japanese creators and are asking if they're interested in making anime from this story. Ghost of Tsushima  [based on the Sony PlayStation game] is a great example. Solo Leveling is a great example. We took this Korean [title based on the web novel-turned-webtoon], and went back to Japan and said we would love to make an anime. And we got partners like Aniplex and A-1 Pictures excited about it. That's the third piece. Licensed content will always be the majority of our content because there's so many great Japanese viewers. We will co-produce content with our Japanese partners to invest and bring shows. But we will also commission shows because we have stories that we think will be great in anime, and we're taking them back to Japan. 

	











Anime has done some interesting things as it relates to theatrical releases, an area Hollywood has really been having a conversation about the last few years. The recent Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye experience, which put the first three episodes of season two together and screened them like a movie, is one example. Is there anything you think Hollywood can learn about the theatrical space from the anime industry in this current moment?


	I'm not sure we're at a place where we can tell Hollywood what it can learn. They've been doing this for a long time. (Laughs) What we have found and learned is that fans like experiences. They want to be able to go sit in a dark theater with friends and family and experience their stories on a big screen and feel that sense of community. So for them, it doesn't matter if it's a 90-minute or 120-minute movie, or it's three episodes put together. To them, it is great stories told in an amazing, creative way on a big screen. That is an interesting insight for us.


What are other growth areas you're focusing on right now that are represented at AX? 


	Games. About 18 months ago, we announced this initiative called Crunchyroll Game Vault. If you're a subscriber of Crunchyroll's higher tiers — mega or ultimate tier — you get access to games for free. We initially started with a handful of games, and now we've scaled that to over 60 that fans and subscribers have access to, to play for free. We're seeing a lot of traction. Fans come in to play a game and then watch something, and we are seeing a lot of subscribers that have been members for years dive in and play games telling us that they want to upgrade to be able to get access to the games. That is an area where we are really excited because there's a big overlap between gamers and anime fans. 

	











	And we recently announced that we're going to be bringing a digital manga app to our fans in the U.S. One of the things that fans ask us most is for access to manga, so we see a lot of opportunity to be able to serve fans through it. And obviously, merchandise. Fans are collectors. They want to show off their fandom, and we want to be able to bring these unique collector items — whether it is apparel, figures, home accessories — that they can buy. Another area that we see is theatrical. Demon Slayer is coming up, we are part of Sony Pictures and they've been bringing movies to the world for 100-plus years. So we're really excited about being able to bring movies to fans who want to watch in theaters. We know fans love that. 


You mentioned experiences and the exhibitor booth is one giant experience. Why is this such an important corner for Crunchyrull to occupy and are you thinking about ways to go bigger? 


	We're very fan-centric, very fan-first in our thinking. The fan sits at the center of everything we do. So we are here to serve this fanbase, and the best way for us to do that is to understand what they want, talk to them, connect with them, build a relationship with them. We don't know any other way to do this. Our teams put on 100-plus shows worldwide. This is not a few things a year that we do. We are constantly spending time with our fans. In terms of experiences, do we want to do something bigger? Yes, if the opportunity shows up the right way and we can create that authentic experience for fans, we will do that. We're doing that with videos. We're doing that with music festivals. At San Diego Comic-Con, we're going to have an anime music festival. Do we have a ride at a theme park? No. But are we creating experiences that excite? Absolutely.

“I'm excited to meet them one day, it'll be great when we can all get in a room together,” Corenswet said of the two actors who have previously portrayed the iconic superhero.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	Former Supermen Henry Cavill and Tyler Hoechlin showed support for David Corenswet as he took on the renowned role in James Gunn's new Superman, but the two actors were reluctant to give him any explicit advice on how to tackle the part. 


	At the London premiere of the DC Studios film, the actor revealed in an interview with Heart that he'd spoken with both Cavill and Hoechlin, but both of the former Superman stars didn't give him “any tips” on how to approach his film. 




	“I had the pleasure of exchanging letters with two previous Supermans, Henry Cavill and Tyler Hoechlin. Both of them, interestingly, sort of said in their own words, ‘I'm not gonna try to give you any tips,'” he said, via Beat 102 103. “And I think that's a very Superman thing — Superman's not so much for giving advice or dictating how other people should be.”

	While both actors were reluctant to give Corenswet specific suggestions on how to best portray the Man of Steel, they did send him encouragement. 


	“They really just conveyed to me an encouragement and a sense of, you know, have fun with it, which I think is Superman's way of doing it too,” he explained. “They were very encouraging and we had a lovely exchange.” 


	The Twisters actor added that while he hasn't met with Cavill and Hoechlin face-to-face quite yet, “I'm excited to meet them one day, it'll be great when we can all get in a room together.” 


	Gunn's Superman will hit theaters on July 11, serving as the first time Corenswet will portray the iconic superhero. Cavill starred as Clark Kent in Zack Snyder's 2013 Man of Steel, 2016's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and 2017's Justice League, while Hoechlin starred as the character in the CW's TV series Superman & Lois from 2021 to 2024.

	











	Of choosing Corenswet to lead his Superman film, Gunn said that he had a great chemistry test with Rachel Brosnahan, who is set to star as Lois Lane. He explained, “David had better chemistry with Rachel [Brosnahan] because she's a very controlled actor, and David is a little bit more, you know, loose, and that creates a different type of dynamism on-screen.”

	Experts are concerned about the dangerous conditions at Alligator Alcatraz, the immigrant detention center that opened Tuesday in the Florida Everglades. Hurricanes, flooding, and mosquitoes pose a more likely threat to people incarcerated there than the alligators and snakes that President Donald Trump has “joked” about. 


	Built in eight days, the facility consists of large tents, bunk beds, and chain link fences that form cages to hold about 3,000 people. It has already flooded once. Despite the rudimentary setup, it will cost $450 million a year to run, according to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.


	The first group of immigrants have already been brought to Alligator Alcatraz, according to the Florida Division of Emergency Management. “Florida is proud to help facilitate @realDonaldTrump's mission to enforce immigration law,” the division posted on X. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The facility's inhospitable nature is a selling point for Republicans. “If people get out, there's not much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons,” Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said in a video promoting Alligator Alcatraz. “Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.” 

	











	The immigrants “are in a facility that is very inaccessible to lawyers, to family members, to oversight,” Renata Bozzetto, deputy director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, told The Washington Post in an article published Saturday. “So the location being so remote and isolated is a problem. Being in an environmentally fragile ecosystem is a problem. Being constructed with temporary materials will be catastrophic in case of a hurricane.”

	











	The facility is in a High-Velocity Hurricane Zone, where building code requires that buildings have a wind-resistant design. Florida's Emergency Management Director, Kevin Guthrie, told The Washington Post that the structures are rated for winds traveling 110 miles an hour. For reference, top speeds of last year's Hurricane Milton reached 180 miles per hour.

	In a state where backyard pools are surrounded on all sides by screens, the mosquitos are so bad that television reporters are even having trouble doing their jobs. 


	“You're probably wondering why I'm wearing a hoodie and a rain jacket, and that's because you can barely walk outside here because of the mosquitoes,” said NBC6's Hatzel Vela. “Naturally, when you get a lot of rain and puddles of water, that of course breeds a lot of mosquitoes.”


	The mosquitoes can cause serious health risks.


	“The risk of mosquito-borne disease at this site is significant,” Durland Fish, professor emeritus of epidemiology at the Yale University School of Public Health told The Washington Post. Mosquitoes in the Everglades can cause neurological damage like encephalitis, which can be life threatening. 


	“The second you open up your car, your car is infested with mosquitoes,” Florida Rep. Anna Eskamani told Fox 13. She said she wore a mosquito net and was still bitten dozens of times. 


	Eskamani was one of five Democrats who were denied entry to the facility on Thursday. 


	“Florida law gives legislators the authority to make unannounced visits to state-run facilities — to inspect conditions and check on the wellbeing of the people inside. I've served in the Legislature for 13 years, and this has never happened,” state Sen. Shevrin Jones posted on X. 


	“This is a blatant abuse of power and an attempt to conceal human rights violations from the public eye,” the lawmakers said in a joint statement.

	Some donors are cashing in on the camp, Rolling Stone reported earlier this week. For example, the president of CDR Companies, which Bloomberg reported “will run medical services and did some site preparation,” has made donations to President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. 


	The facility is surrounded on three sides by the homes of Miccosukee and Seminole people, including their ceremonial sites. “It's a place where we come for healing, where we come to pray,” Betty Osceola, a member of the Everglades Advisory Board and the Miccosukee Tribe told NBC News.

The seventh installment in the action-adventure series created by Steven Spielberg opened well ahead of expectations over the long Fourth of July holiday in the U.S. — where it racked up $147.3 million — as well as overseas. 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The dinos have a new lease on life.


	Universal and Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth came in well ahead of expectations at the Fourth of July box office to hatch a new era for the Steven Spielberg-created franchise. In North America, the holiday tentpole is reporting an estimated five-day domestic opening of $147.3 million, including $91.5 million for the three-day weekend. (Estimates have been revised upwards every day since the pic hit the big screen midweek on July 2.)




Jurassic World Rebirth, the seventh title in the series, is roaring even louder overseas, where it opened to an estimated $171 million from more than 80 markets. That puts the film's global start at $318.3 million — the second-best launch of the franchise, and the biggest worldwide opening of the year to date, after passing up A Minecraft Movie. No one saw that coming.

	Internationally, Rebirth scored the second-best international opening of the year and of the franchise. It even bit off a big number in China, where Hollywood tentpoles can no longer depend upon big grosses. The dino franchise, like the Mission: Impossible films, is an exception. Rebirth debuted to $41.5 million to score the biggest opening of the year so far for a Hollywood title. And it already ranks as the second-biggest Hollywood pic of the year behind Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning. Other top markets included the U.K. ($16.6 million) and Mexico ($14 million).


	In North America, Rebirth ranks as the fourth-best showing ever for the July Fourth holiday, both in terms of the five-day and three-day number. That's no small feat considering July 4 fell on a Friday this year, meaning many moviegoers were distracted by holiday outings on what's normally a critical day for new films.

	











	To boot, the latest Jurassic World pic has received decidedly mixed reviews from both critics and audiences alike (one example: it earned a meh B CinemaScore from moviegoers). But there's no dismissing the power of the Jurassic brand, or the spectacle of seeing dinosaurs come to life on the big screen. “It's the definition of a popcorn movie,” is one common refrain making the rounds in Hollywood. Another? “It's dumb fun.”


	Heading into the holiday, the pic was eyeing a far more modest domestic opening in the $100 to $120 million range and $260 million globally, considering it was a reboot and the seventh installment in a series more than 30 years old.


	Following the conclusion of the Jurassic World trilogy directed by Colin Trevorrow, Spielberg, Amblin and Universal, they went back to the drawing board and enlisted filmmaker Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) to direct Rebirth from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp.


	The film features an all-new cast anchored by Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali and Jonathan Bailey. The story follows an extraction team that races to an island research facility that factored into the original Jurassic Park (along the way, they discover a shipwrecked family). Now, the island is inhabited by the worst of the worst creatures that were left behind.Rupert Friend, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Luna Blaise, David Iacono and Audrina Miranda also star. Producers include longtime franchise stewards Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, with Spielberg and Denis Stewart exec producing.


	The first three Jurassic World pics all grossed north of $1 billion globally, and all opened higher than Rebirth domestically (comparisons are complicated by the fact that those were all there-day, non-holiday openings). In 2015, Jurassic World opened to a franchise-best $208.8 million, followed by $148 million for 2018's Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and $145 million for 2022's Jurassic World: Dominion, not adjusted for inflation. At the same time, the latest film cost less to produce, or a net $180 million before marketing.

	











	The first Jurassic Park, directed by Spielberg, opened to $47 million domestically in early June 1993, not adjusted for inflation — a huge sum at the time.


	Also setting off fireworks at the box office was Brad Pitt's F1: The Movie, which has already earned nearly $300 million globally, including a 10-day domestic tally of $109.5 million. 


	From Apple Original Films in partnership with Warner Bros., F1 came in second over the holiday weekend with an estimated three-day gross of $26.1 million. Overseas, it racked up another $56.3 million for a foreign cume of $184.1 million and $293.6 million globally.


	The movie, reteaming Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer, is a critical and audience darling and fell just 54 percent in its second outing. The film is enjoying a major boost from having a lock on Imax screens for three weekends. 


	Universal was a double winner at the holiday box office as DreamWorks Animation's live-action How to Train Your Dragon came in third place with an estimated $11 million for a domestic tally of $224 million. Globally, it set off fireworks in clearing the $500 million milestone after amassing a foreign haul of $292.9 million. 


	Pixar and Disney's troubled pic Elio came in fourth with an estimated $5.7 million for a muted domestic tally of $55.1 million. Overseas, it earned another $6.7 million for a foreign tally of $41.7 million and $96.8 million globally.

	











	Danny Boyle and Sony's 28 Years Later rounded out the top five domestically with $4.6 million for a domestic haul of $60.2 million. The sequel grossed another $7 million at the international box office for a foreign total of $65.6 million and $125.8 million globally.


Blumhouse and Atomic Monster's ill-fated M3GAN 2.0 fell off somewhat less than expected, or 62 percent, in its second weekend to an estimated $3.8 million after bombing in its debut a week ago. The Universal releases tied for sixth place with Disney's live-action Lilo & Stitch, which is likewise reporting a three-day gross of $3.8 million.


Lilo & Stitch made major headlines in passing up A Minecraft Movie to become the top-earning pic of 2025 at the worldwide box office after finishing Sunday with a global total of $972.7 million. It remains to be seen whether the Memorial Day release can become the first Hollywood title of the year to join the billion-dollar club. 


	Elsewhere on the top 10 chart, fellow Memorial Day release Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning finished Sunday with a global haul of $576.2 million.

	More than a decade after her breakout HBO series took off, Lena Dunham has come a long way as a writer and producer.


	The Golden Globe winner recently said she's come to find diversity is “one of the most important things” in making television after she was criticized for the lack of diverse characters featured on Girls, which ran for six seasons from 2012 to 2017.


	“I think one of the profound issues around Girls was that there was so little real estate for women in television [then] that if you had a show called Girls, which is such a monolithic name, it sounds like it's describing all the girls in all the places,” she explained to The Independent. “And so if it's not reflecting a multitude of experiences, I understand how that would be really disappointing to people.”

	Also starring Allison Williams, Jemima Kirke and Zosia Mamet, the show was criticized for mostly starring white actors, many of whom have since been dubbed ‘nepo babies'. Back in 2012, Dunham reasoned she is “a half-Jew, half-WASP” and wanted to avoid “tokenism in casting.”


	Dunham noted to The Independent that she “liked the conversation around Girls” as it was an important one to have, and she's since put what she's learned into practice, most recently on her Netflix series Too Much, premiering July 10 on the streamer.


	“The thing I have really come to believe is that one of the most important things is not just diversity in front of the camera, but it's diversity behind the camera. As a producer, one of my goals is to bring a lot of different voices into a position where they can tell their story,” added Dunham.


Too Much stars Meg Stalter as New Yorker Jessica, who moves to London after a disastrous breakup and sparks a romance with musician Felix (Will Sharpe). Co-created by Dunham and husband Luis Felber, the Girls alum plays Jessica's older sister, who has retreated from public life after a messy divorce sent her moving back in with their mom.

Can't fault her for her experiences. However her show was like a Woody Allen movie where you live in NYC and there's no POC at all unless in a club, playing jazz or r&b music or a sports event or areas where they are imagined to belong.

The issue was that the show took place in Brooklyn, and there were mad nonwhite people in Brooklyn at the time. Dunham and her ilk were seen as invaders. To me, Girls was the same as the Walking Dead, but with rich white people instead of zombies.

Something has always stayed with me about Girls.

They were Broke, not Poor.

THIS was the show. Privileged people.

You made the show the way you wanted your world reflected. Stand on that. The show wasn't for us. And we won't be watching this one either. All good for your audience.

Please go somewhere out of sight

	“Let the madness begin!” bellowed a mischievous Ozzy Osbourne from his bat-and-skull encrusted throne in front of a sold-out Villa Park in Birmingham, England. The Prince of Darkness had finally taken to the stage after a marathon of legendary metal bands paid homage to his life and work throughout the day for his and Black Sabbath‘s Back to the Beginning concert on Saturday, July 5. 


	The Summer of Sabbath had been in full flow in Birmingham for weeks now, though. The proud home city of heavy metal rolled out the purple carpet for its most famous sons' homecoming. Boozers were decked with purple balloons and flags; murals were everywhere you looked; people donned Ozzy outfits, flooding the streets with battered T-shirts and denim jackets. It felt like a World Cup final for the metal fans who flooded in from every corner of the planet. 


	That carnival atmosphere hit the moment you stepped out of New Street Station, where fans gathered around the nearby Black Sabbath Bridge mural, which Osbourne and the band duly signed earlier in the week. We met one fan from London, who said he was on a Sabbath pilgrimage before the gates opened later in the day. “I'm going around the city doing all of the sites like The Crown where they played their first ever show, the various exhibitions and Ozzy the Bull!” 

	











	This of course was before you even made your way to Villa Park, the historic football ground housed in the working class suburb which was once home to the band's four members. 

	











	Upon arrival, we were greeted by rumbles of distortion and a giant inflatable Ozzy who watched over his parish. Heading into the stadium, Cody Holl, a fan who traveled from Pennsylvania, was in a state of giddy delirium. “It's Black Sabbath's last Sabbath,” Holl said. “I've never seen them before and I told myself after that 2017 tour, I'm going no matter what, I just had to be here.”


	The heavy metal royalty who graced the stage throughout the day were clearly struck by a similar sense of awe, that's perhaps because Black Sabbath have shaped and influenced each and every one of them, from openers Mastadon right through to thrash veterans Anthrax and Lamb of God. The latter delivered an early standout moment with a cover of “Children of the Grave,” which drew a gaping circle pit that formed on the pitch.

	The day was packed with such moments: For those lucky enough to get a ticket to the sold-out bash, the main challenge presented was bottling it all up. 


	Even on this star-studded lineup though, there was always room for surprise as Yungblud joined the day's first supergroup set for a cover of “Changes.” Stomping onstage with spit and venom, he dedicated the band's most heartfelt song to the late Liverpool striker Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car crash. “We'd all collectively like to dedicate this next song to Diogo Jota. God bless Black Sabbath and God bless Ozzy Osbourne,” he declared before a heartfelt rendition that stopped the stadium in its tracks. 


	Amid the palpable emotion there was also scope for the ridiculous as Blink-182's Travis Barker, Red Hot Chili Pepper's Chad Smith, and Tool's Danny Carey indulged in a drum-off fronted by Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello. That was before Billy Corgan and Judas Priest guitarist KK Downing entered the fray and tore into “Breaking the Law.”


	The extravaganza rolled on with more legends including Alice in Chains, Gojira, Pantera, and Tool, who all seized their respective 30-minute sets. As the sun dipped under the clouds, Slayer took to the stage and produced the day's biggest moshpit so far, the kind that felt like dicing with death when entering as they shredded through genre-defining epics like “Reign in Blood” and “Angel of Death.”

Guns N' Roses teed up the home stretch towards Metallica, Osbourne, and Sabbath. Having headlined this very venue themselves but a week prior, the rock giants were clearly loving life as they covered “Sabbath Bloody Sabbath” before the iconic guitar intro of “Welcome to the Jungle.” 

	











	One of the most profound tributes to Sabbath came from Metallica's James Hetfield as he surveyed the thousands ahead of him. “Without Sabbath there would be no Metallica, thank you boys for giving us a purpose in life,” he said before unleashing a career-spanning run of the band's biggest anthems.  


	After a strobing montage of his glory days, Osbourne took to the stage and shot straight from the hip. “It's so good to be on this fucking stage you have no idea,” he said before questioning, “Have you had a good day today?” before the ominous organ intro of “Mr. Crowley.”


	Osbourne was trembling with emotion as he sang the ballad “Mama I'm Coming Home,” and the sense of meaning was almost unprecedented as he was back where it all began over 50 years ago.


	After a riotous rendition of “Crazy Train,” he departed and returned for a condensed set with Black Sabbath, who arrived to the rain and church bell tolls of “War Pigs.” It was pure theater as Osbourne clutched the microphone stand with OZZY tattooed upon his knuckles and sang that opening line that still speaks to the world today: “Generals gathered in their masses…”


	Though confined to his chair, Osbourne writhed and wriggled like a man summoning every last inch of the hell-raising spirit still in him as he bowed out with “Iron Man” and “Paranoid.” “Go fucking crazy, it's the last song,” he said before the latter and boy did the masses oblige. 


	For all the false farewells and goodbyes in his career, there was something so final about this one that added a crushing poignancy to the night.  


	The great tragedy is that so often such legends die before celebrations on this level can take place, yet by some great miracle or divine intervention Ozzy Osbourne was here to take his final bow with his own tribe.

The world lost a talented and memorable '90s icon yesterday, leaving fans and co-stars alike in shock. Julian McMahon, best known for his iconic roles in “Charmed” and “Nip/Tuck,” tragically passed away at the age of 56. The sad news was shared by his family, specifically his wife, Kelly McMahon, revealing the actor passed due to a private battle with cancer.

“Julian loved life. He loved his family. He loved his friends. He loved his work, and he loved his fans. His deepest wish was to bring joy into as many lives as possible,” she revealed. “We ask for support during this time to allow our family to grieve in privacy. And we wish for all of those to whom Julian brought joy, to continue to find joy in life. We are grateful for the memories.”

McMahon's former co-stars, Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano, took to social media to mourn the loss of their beloved friend. Both talented powerhouses showcased the immense impact McMahon had on their lives.

A post shared by Holly Combs (@thehmc)

Combs, who played Piper Halliwell on “Charmed,” shared a heartfelt tribute on Instagram, remembering their time together both on and off set. McMahon portrayed Cole Turner, a pivotal character in the series, from 2000 to 2005. The relationship with Combs' character was central to some of the show's most memorable and iconic storylines. This due to their strong characters crashing when it came to protecting Phoebe, who was the youngest Halliwell sister, and Cole's love interest.

Combs described McMahon as “one of a kind,” reflecting on his zest for life and his unique ability to make others laugh. The actress went on to post a montage of several throwback moments from the show, writing, “The joy and laughter you were the direct cause of will always be remembered. I hope you find our lady friend and dance in those rose petals.”

The heartfelt message is likely a reference to Shannen Doherty, who played Prue Halliwell during the show's first three seasons. Doherty tragically passed away in 2024 after her battle with cancer. 

Combs' words resonated deeply with fans, suggesting a hopeful reunion between McMahon and Doherty in the afterlife. Fans reacted kindly to the post, sharing their love for the actress, all while sending their condolences.

“Oh no, I'm so sorry. I saw an article where his wife said, He just wanted to bring joy to everyone. Well I will tell you that you brought me a lot of joy as Cole charmed. I always loved you. And I know I wasn't the only one resting in peace,” a fan said.

Another added, “This is so heartbreaking. 💔 I'm so sorry to hear this and I'm so sorry for the loss of your friend. I loved you all together on Charmed.”

A post shared by Alyssa Milano (@milano_alyssa)

Milano, who portrayed Phoebe Halliwell, also shared her own tribute to the late actor. On “Charmed,” Milano's character had a complex and passionate romantic relationship with McMahon's character. It quickly became a fan favorite and one of the show's most iconic love/hate storylines due to their character differences. Milano described McMahon's death as “too soon” and “too unfair,” remembering the strong connection they shared during filming. 

“Julian McMahon was magic. That smile. That laugh. That talent. That presence. He walked into a room and lit it up—not just with charisma, but with kindness. With mischief. With soulful understanding,” Milano wrote. 

She also fondly remembered him as a “dear friend,” emphasizing that their bond extended far beyond their on-screen romance. “Julian was more than my TV husband. He was a dear friend. The kind who checks in,” she said. “The kind who remembers. The kind who shares. The kind who tells you the truth, even when it's uncomfortable—but always with love.”

McMahon's death has left a void in the hearts of many, but his legacy as a talented actor continues to live on. Known for his unique roles, including in “Nip/Tuck,” where he portrayed the charming but troubled Dr. Christian Troy, the actor knew how to create a fan base in an instant. The actor also made a significant mark in film, most notably as Doctor Doom in the “Fantastic Four” movies. There, he starred alongside Chris Evans, Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd, and Michael Chiklis. 

The actor's charisma, talent, and larger-than-life personality made him a standout in every role. It's safe to say his contributions to both TV and film will be remembered for years to come.

As tributes continue to pour in, it's clear that McMahon's impact on the entertainment industry and those who knew him personally will never be forgotten. Fans and colleagues alike now carry his vibrant spirit with them, and his memory will live on through the characters he brought to life.

	With the fifth and final season of The Boys approaching, Eric Kripke has something special in store for fans of his work.


	Soldier Boy actor Jensen Ackles recently teased his reunion with Supernatural co-stars Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins ahead of the Prime Video series' concluding episodes, for which their characters have not yet been revealed.


	“We see each other more often than you would think — honestly, at least once a month,” he told People after they starred in Kripke's CW series for 15 seasons from 2005 to 2020.

	Ackles added, “It was weird. It was like inviting my friends over to somebody else's house for dinner. I was like, ‘Listen, guys, don't make me look bad. I got to stay here.' They were amazing. I can't wait to talk more about it because it was quite an experience.”

	











	After Kripke expressed his desire to work with Padalecki on the concluding season of The Boys, the actor told Deadline he's in. “The answer is yes,” he said last June.


	“We have talked [about a role]. As a matter of fact, we talked today,” added Padalecki. “I think at this point in my acting life, I only want to work on projects that I really care about or with people that I really care about, and obviously Eric and I are indelibly connected forever.”


	After Ackles joined the series as Soldier Boy during Season 3, his and Padalecki's Supernatural onscreen dad Jeffrey Dean Morgan appeared as Joe Kessler via Billy Butcher's hallucination in Season 4.

	











	This week, Kripke bid farewell to The Boys set as he wrapped the finale. “It's bittersweet, but my primary feeling is gratitude,” he wrote in part. “We have the best cast, the best crew, the most fun story to write, and something that is impossible to predict: the right timing. You wait your whole career to have maybe two of those things, if you're lucky. We got all of them.”


	The final season of The Boys, premiering in 2026, comes after Season 4 topped the Nielsen streaming scores for the first time, setting multiple records for Prime Video.

‘Supernatural' fans will soon witness a long-anticipated on-screen reunion as Jensen Ackles expressed enthusiasm over once again collaborating with former co-stars Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins in the concluding season of ‘The Boys'.

In a recent interview with People, Ackles opened up about his enduring friendship with Padalecki and Collins, saying, “We see each other more often than you would think — honestly, at least once a month.”

Reflecting on the recent experience of having both actors visit and work with him on the set, he shared, “It was weird. It was like inviting my friends over to somebody else's house for dinner. I was like, ‘Listen, guys, don't make me look bad. I got to stay here.' They were amazing. I can't wait to talk more about it because it was quite an experience.”

The possibility of Padalecki joining the Prime Video series gained traction after Kripke publicly expressed his desire to work with the actor on 'The Boys' final season. Padalecki confirmed to Deadline last June that he was open to the idea. “The answer is yes,” he said, signalling his willingness to reunite with his former showrunner and co-star.

The fourth season of ‘The Boys', which is currently airing, also saw the arrival of another ‘Supernatural' alumnus. Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who portrayed the Winchester brothers' father in the earlier seasons of the CW series, made a memorable appearance as Joe Kessler — a hallucination tormenting Karl Urban's Billy Butcher.

This week, Kripke marked the end of principal photography on The Boys' finale with a heartfelt message on social media. “It's bittersweet, but my primary feeling is gratitude,” he wrote. “We have the best cast, the best crew, the most fun story to write, and something that is impossible to predict: the right timing. You wait your whole career to have maybe two of those things, if you're lucky. We got all of them.”

This reunion would not only serve as a nostalgic moment for long-time viewers of ‘Supernatural', but also a fitting culmination to Kripke's two most iconic genre-bending series.

Ackles, who starred as Dean Winchester for 15 seasons alongside Padalecki's Sam Winchester in Eric Kripke's cult CW series ‘Supernatural' (2005–2020), joined ‘The Boys' in its third season as Soldier Boy. Since then, The Boys has continued to attract a growing audience, with Kripke, the showrunner, now preparing to bring the story to a close with its upcoming fifth season.

As production wraps and anticipation builds for the fifth and final season of The Boys, fans will be watching closely for any official announcements confirming the reunion that genre television enthusiasts have long awaited.

Kandiss Taylor, a congressional candidate from Georgia and supporter of President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, faced criticism for a social media post Saturday in which she shared conspiracy theories about the recent deadly flash floods along Texas's Guadalupe River.

In a post on the social platform X, Taylor, who is currently campaigning for a House seat in Georgia, wrote: "FAKE WEATHER. REAL DAMAGE." 

She added: "Hurricane Helene left me powerless for 16 days & caused $57K in damage. This isn't just 'climate change.' It's cloud seeding, geoengineering, & manipulation. If fake weather causes real tragedy, that's murder. Pray. Prepare. Question the narrative."

Hurricane Helene struck Florida in September of last year, unleashing devastating flooding, powerful winds, and triggering numerous landslides throughout the southeastern U.S. The storm's strength was intensified by unusually warm ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean, a condition linked to ongoing climate change and not cloud seeding..

The congressional candidate's remarks denying climate change in light of the deadly flash floods in Texas were strongly criticized on social media.

Former Congressman Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill) reacted to her post and said: "Hey Texas. What do you think of this? She's running for congress as a Republican? Any thoughts?"

"To politicize such devastating events with no basic knowledge of weather processes is disgraceful to the millions of families impacted," wrote another X user in response to Taylor's post.

"I can't believe these people walk among us. Truly frightening," said another user in a post.

Meanwhile, MAGA-aligned Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) announced on Saturday her intention to propose legislation targeting “weather modification.”

“I am introducing a bill that prohibits the injection, release, or dispersion of chemicals or substances into the atmosphere for the express purpose of altering weather, temperature, climate, or sunlight intensity. It will be a felony offense,” she stated in a post on X.

The Lakefront Psychic and Holistic Festival returns to the Walter F. Bruce VFW Post 1145 in St. Clair Shores July 11-13 and offers healing for mind, body and spirit.

“This is considered to be a healing and fun event,” said organizer Laura Moody, president of Rock Your World Events. “The event is body, mind and spirit and you have to have them all in balance to have a good life.

“If the body isn't doing well, the mind and the spirit get down.”

The setting itself on the shores of Lake St. Clair is very healing. Many people spend some time sitting by the shore during the three-day festival enjoying food from one of the food trucks or just listening to music.

There will be psychics, mediums, astrologers, tarot card readers, reiki healers, reflexologists and massage therapists. Vendors will be selling organic herbs and soaps, crystals, books and many other wares.

“The healing of the mind can come with the readings; you get an uplifted reading and you are feeling better about your life,” said Moody, who will be doing pet readings. “The reiki is the spirit stuff that works on the whole aura of you.

“No matter where people are at, whatever they are working on, we have something for them.”

New this year is a crystal wire wrapping class where people can choose a crystal and create a pendant that can be worn as a necklace. There will be classes at noon on Saturday and Sunday and $30 gets you admission to the event and the class.

“All of the materials are there and you can pick a crystal that speaks to you and walk out wearing a pendant that you have made,” said Moody. “It is a beautiful wrap and very sophisticated.”

Music by headliner Nashville singer-songwriter Shanna in a Dress, Michigan musician Rob Crozier as well as local acoustic artists will fill the airwaves throughout the weekend.

Tickets are $6 for Friday, July 11, and $10 for Saturday, July 12, and Sunday, July 13, but if tickets are purchased online at www.rywevents.com the $10 tickets are 2-for-1. Tickets can also be purchased at the door, but the special pricing is only available online. There are weekend passes available for $16. Children 12 and under get free admission.

“This is a family event and even if you are not into getting a reading, you can come and shop and listen to music and sit by the lake,” Moody said.

The event will take place at the Walter F. Bruce VFW Post #1145, 28404 Jefferson Avenue, St. Clair Shores, Michigan, 48081 on Friday, July 11, from 3 p.m. – 9 p.m., Saturday, July 12, and Sunday, July 13, from 10 a.m. – 6 p.m.

All individual readings and service sessions are offered at a reasonable cost in addition to general admission.

UFO expert Kathleen Marden holds up one of her books about UFO abductions and other anomalies at the UFO Museum on Friday.

During her long career as a UFO investigator and researcher, Kathleen Marden worked on multiple studies involving thousands of experiencers — parties who say they have seen or interacted with entities not known on earth. She spoke about surveys and analysis of “experiencers” at the International UFO Museum and Research Center on Friday.

Marden is the niece of Betty and Barney Hill, a couple purported to have been abducted and examined by aliens in September 1961. Early on, she was convinced that what the Hills experienced were otherworldly encounters. As Marden was nearing the conclusion of her presentation titled, “The ET Presence: A Multidisciplinary Assessment,” she began talking about the United States Congressional Hearing on UFOs that occurred in 2024 and the subsequent All-domain Anomaly Resolution. 

This document, touted as a historical report on U.S. government studies about Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or UAP for short, was “an enormous lie.”

“The military-industrial intelligence complex has exerted its power,” she said. 

Marden's examples include threats being targeted toward civilian investigators now “being worse than ever” and an uptick of misinformation delivered to the public through movies that use people's real names. On Saturday, Marden focused on what happened to her aunt and uncle with the lecture “Betty and Barney Hill: Their UFO Encounter and the Aftermath.”  

Nearly 65 years have elapsed since the Hills were sought out by what appears to be extraterrestrial beings. What happened to them while traveling home to Portsmouth, New Hampshire after visiting Niagara Falls and Montreal is also the first widely reported information about a UFO abduction in the United States.

As the trustee of her aunt Betty's estate, Marden has made it a priority to protect her aunt and uncle's reputations as honest people who were also involved in making their community better. Betty was a social worker and her husband worked for the post office. The interracial couple, Barney was black and Betty was white, was involved in civil rights issues and the NAACP. Barney was also on a local body of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.

A newspaper broke the story about the Hills' abduction in 1965. While the reporting was a substantial breech of their privacy, it prompted other witnesses to come forward with their accounts. They reported what they saw and went through to authorities, including the U.S. Air Force. 

Significant aspects of what Betty went through had been buried deep in her subconscious. She was having discomforting dreams. Barney remembered more about what had happened. In 1963, his emotional distress became “a life-threatening condition,” Marden explained before talking about her aunt and uncle's visits to a neuropsychiatrist who used hypnosis and therapy.

The doctor hypnotized each of them separately because of how they were affected by the abduction, which included medical exams with some invasive procedures, Marden said. 

“Betty's dreams seemed to real to be dreams,” she said about her aunt's having five days of starting her sleeping thoughts with conscious recall, then recalling their car being surrounded by the abductors and “being walked to a craft” and ”taken to examining rooms.”      

Experts tested the dress she had been wearing the night of the event and found residue of materials that had no reason to be there and another was able to recreate a part of the galaxy in which one of abductors said was where came from within the universe.

And such findings were verified by other experts.

Reports that came from the government were twisted to make the Hills look bad and was how the government kept the truth from the public.  

Roswell-born actress Demi Moore and actor Colman Domingo — both previous Academy Award nominees — are starring in an upcoming film about the Hills titled ”Strange Arrivals.” This project is at a point in the movie-making process referred to as “development/pre-production.”

“Their experience catapulted them to fame and celebrity, but underneath that notoriety simmered the truth of what really happened that night, which would test even the most epic of romances,” according to Variety, an entertainment industry publication.  

“Despite all the evidence you have seen, a new Hollywood movie is under production that will depict Betty as a delusional woman and Barney as the man who loves her and believes in her,” she said.
