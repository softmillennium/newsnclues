                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dementia poses a major health challenge with no safe, affordable treatments to slow its progression. Researchers at Lawson Research Institute (Lawson), the research arm of St. Joseph's Health Care London, are investigating whether Ambroxol -- a cough medicine used safely for decades in Europe -- can slow dementia in people with Parkinson's disease. Published on June 30 in the prestigious JAMA Neurology, this 12-month clinical trial involving 55 participants with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) monitored memory, psychiatric symptoms and GFAP, a blood marker linked to brain damage. About half of those diagnosed with Parkinson's develop dementia within 10 years, profoundly affecting patients, families and the health care system. "This early trial offers hope and provides a strong foundation for larger studies." Although Ambroxol is approved in Europe for treating respiratory conditions and has a long-standing safety record -- including use at high doses and during pregnancy -- it is not approved for any use in Canada or the U.S. "These findings suggest Ambroxol may protect brain function, especially in those genetically at risk. Ambroxol supports a key enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which is produced by the GBA1 gene. When this enzyme doesn't work properly, waste builds up in brain cells, leading to damage. He is now applying that research to explore whether boosting GCase with Ambroxol could help protect the brain in Parkinson's-related diseases. "This research is vital because Parkinson's dementia profoundly affects patients and families," says Pasternak. "If a drug like Ambroxol can help, it could offer real hope and improve lives." Funded by the Weston Foundation, this study is an important step toward developing new treatments for Parkinson's disease and other cognitive disorders, including dementia with Lewy bodies. Pasternak and his team plan to start a follow-up clinical trial focused specifically on cognition later this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Japan, Shinrin Yoku or forest bathing has already been used for therapeutic applications, for instance, to lower blood pressure and stress levels. For their study, the researchers wanted to find out whether forest bathing - consciously immersing oneself in nature - can also be effective when done virtually, and focused on whether the positive effect is stronger when several senses are addressed simultaneously. The participants experienced the virtual forest scenery either as a full sensory experience (with images, sound and scent) or in a reduced form whereby forest stimuli appealing to just a single sense - visual, auditory or olfactory - were used. In variants where only hearing or scent was activated, participants were placed in a neutral virtual environment to minimize visual stimuli and the influence of VR technology. More than 130 participants were first put into an acute stress situation using stress-inducing images. Then, equipped with VR glasses, they experienced one of the four forest stimulation/ bathing variants. The results show that the combination of all three sensory stimuli led to a significantly greater improvement in mood and a stronger feeling of connection with nature compared to when individual sensory stimuli were presented. "We can already say that digital nature experiences can absolutely produce an emotional effect - even if they don't replace actual nature," reports Leonie Ascone, lead author of the study and researcher in the Neuronal Plasticity working group at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE). Simone Kühn, head of the study and Director of the Center for Environmental Neuroscience at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, adds: "Especially in places with limited access to nature - such as clinics, waiting areas or urban interiors - multisensory VR applications or targeted nature staging could support mental well-being. Kühn conducts intensive research into the effects of the environment on the human brain and, together with colleagues from universities in Vienna, Exeter and Birmingham, was recently able to prove that just from watching nature videos, patients perceive physical pain as less intense (Steininger et al., 2025).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In principle, this impossible math allows for a glue-free bridge of stacked blocks that can stretch across the Grand Canyon—and into infinity Here's a mind-blowing experiment that you can try at home: Gather some children's blocks and place them on a table. Take one block and slowly push it over the table's edge, inch by inch, until it's on the brink of falling. If you possess patience and a steady hand, you should be able to balance it so that exactly half of it hangs off the edge. Stacking as many blocks as you can, what is the farthest overhang you can achieve before the whole structure topples? In principle, a freestanding stack of blocks can span the Grand Canyon, no glue required. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

Don't click “checkout” on an infinite pack of Jenga blocks just yet. Real-world practicalities such as irregular block shapes, air currents and the crushing weight of an endless edifice may hamper your engineering aspirations. Still, understanding why the overhang has no limit in an ideal mathematical world is enlightening. The explanation hinges on math's harmonic series and the physics concept of center of mass, two seemingly simple ideas with outsize power. [For more fun, check out: How Tall Can You Build a Tower without It Toppling?] Your intuition might tell you that a single block can hang half of its mass beyond the table's edge before tipping. Every object has a center of mass—a single point at which we can imagine the entire object's weight to be concentrated when we're thinking about balance. The moment that center of mass passes over an edge, however, gravity will pull the whole thing over. In the case of a spoon, an item with irregular weight distribution, we can hang more than half of the utensil's handle over an edge before it tips because the center of mass lies closer to its head, where more of the weight resides. For our stacked bridge, we assume that our blocks are all identical, with a uniform density (that is, they're not denser in some parts than others), so each one's center of mass sits at the middle point. When we add more blocks, we must account for the center of mass of the entire tower. But after doing that, how far can we push out the bottom block? To see why, let's look at another example. Suppose we have a stable tower that contains five blocks, and we want to add a sixth block below it and then slide the whole structure out as far as we can. We'll first scoot the heavy block as far as it will go so that its center of mass sits right above the bottom block's edge. This is known as the law of the lever—think about how a book feels heavier in your palm the farther you move it away from your body, so a paperback in a fully extended arm might feel equivalent to a textbook held close to your torso. Answering our opening question (how far out can the tower extend?) amounts to adding up all of these successive overhangs. If you have 10 blocks, they can extend to 1⁄2 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄6 + 1⁄8 + 1⁄10 + 1⁄12 + 1⁄14 + 1⁄16 + 1⁄18 + 1⁄20, which adds up to about 1.464 block lengths beyond the edge. But what is the limit to how far we can stack blocks? For that, we must add infinitely many of these shrinking terms. If you look closely, you might notice that the overhangs from the block-stacking problem are exactly half of each of these terms: 1⁄2 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄6 + 1⁄8 + 1⁄10 + ... Calculus, the branch of math that digs into how things change, teaches us that even when adding up infinitely many shrinking terms, sometimes the sum converges on a finite value and sometimes it diverges to infinity. Still, at a relentless snail's pace, the harmonic series grows forever. Of course, translating pure math into practice always comes with hurdles, but the block-stacking problem offers an amusing dexterity challenge. With only four blocks, you should be able to extend the top one a full block length past the edge (1⁄2 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄6 + 1⁄8 = ~1.042). To fulfill my journalistic due diligence, I tried this at home with playing cards on my coffee table. After a few minutes of patient tinkering, I managed to balance the top card just beyond the edge, with it hanging entirely off the table, and I felt like a magician. Two full block lengths beyond any surface would require 31 pieces. Meanwhile100 million pieces wouldn't even get you a full 10 block lengths of overhang because the sum of the first 100 million terms in the harmonic series all divided by 2 equals about 9.5. So it will take some grit to span the Grand Canyon. At huge scales, physics kicks in to topple mathematicians' fun. Jack Murtagh is a freelance math writer and puzzle creator.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But researchers are interested in them for quite different reasons: among the countless minerals already known, they always discover some materials with unusual magnetic properties. A team headed by TU Braunschweig and the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) has now investigated this rare property (DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.216701). These ions also determine the material's magnetic properties: they each have an unpaired electron whose spin gives the ion a magnetic moment - comparable to a tiny needle on a compass. "We refer to this as magnetic frustration," continues Heinze. As result of this frustration, the spins in atacamite only arrange themselves at very low temperatures - under 9 Kelvin (−264°C) - in a static alternating structure. This unusually strong cooling effect particularly fascinated the researchers, as the behavior of magnetically frustrated materials in this context has scarcely been studied. However, magnetocaloric materials are considered a promising alternative to conventional cooling technologies, for example for energy-efficient cooling or the liquefaction of gases. This is because, instead of compressing and expanding a coolant - a process that takes place in every refrigerator - they can be used to change the temperature by applying a magnetic field in an environmentally friendly and potentially low-loss approach. What is the origin of this strong magnetocaloric effect? Additional studies at various labs of the European Magnetic Field Laboratory (EMFL) provided more in-depth insights. "By using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we were clearly able to demonstrate that the magnetic order of atacamite is destroyed when a magnetic field is applied," explains Dr. Tommy Kotte, a scientist at HLD. "This is unusual as the magnetic fields in many magnetically frustrated materials usually counteract the frustration and even encourage ordered magnetic states." When this is removed, a long-range magnetic order can no longer exist. "Of course, we do not expect atacamite to be extensively mined in the future for use in new cooling systems," says Dr. Tommy Kotte, "but the physical mechanism we have investigated is fundamentally new and the magnetocaloric effect we observed is surprisingly strong." The team hopes their work will inspire further research, especially a targeted search for innovative magnetocaloric materials within the extensive class of magnetically frustrated systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurological condition after dementia, with over 150,000 people in Australia living with the condition. The newest study by the same University of Sydney team, published in Acta Neuropathologica Communications,builds on this research. It found that targeting the faulty SOD1 protein with a drug treatment improved the motor function in mice bred to have Parkinson-like symptoms. Professor Double said: "All the mice we treated saw a dramatic improvement in their motor skills which is a really promising sign it could be effective in treating people who have Parkinson disease too. The study involved two groups of mice bred to have Parkinson-like symptoms. One group of mice was treated with a special copper supplement for three months, while the other received a placebo. Professor Double said: "The results were beyond our expectations and suggest, once further studies are carried out, this treatment approach could slow the progression of Parkinson's disease in humans." Parkinson's disease is a degenerative neurological disorder in which dopamine-producing cells in the brain die, leading to a range of symptoms including tremors, muscle stiffness, slow movement and impaired balance. At present there is no known cure and only limited treatments, although researchers hope understanding the causes of the disease will lead to improved treatments. Professor Double said: "As our understanding of Parkinson's disease grows, we are finding that there are many factors contributing to its development and progression in humans - and faulty forms of the SOD1 protein is likely one of them. "Just as researchers found with HIV, Parkinson's disease is a complex condition that likely requires multiple interventions. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), are essential for regulating movement, emotion, and reward processing. Previous research mostly focuses on the functions of DA neurons in mood regulation and reward mechanisms. Their role in more subtle and spontaneous behaviors remains poorly understood. In a study published in Translational Psychiatry, a team led by Prof. Xuemei Liu and Prof. Pengfei Wei from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered that behaviors such as rearing, walking, and hunching are associated with the loss of SNc DA neurons, but not VTA DA neurons. Using a machine learning-enhanced three-dimensional spontaneous behavior analysis system, researchers examined the detailed motor behaviors in two mouse models of dopamine neuron depletion: a subacute MPTP-induced PD model and an AAV-mediated DA neuron loss model. This approach enabled the capture of detailed and nuanced behavioral features that traditional two-dimensional methods may overlook. Although overall motor deficits were not significant, notable behavioral lateralization was revealed in the PD mice. "Connecting behavioral changes with targeted neural damage advances the understanding of PD progression and offers valuable insights into improving treatment strategies," said Prof. Liu.
