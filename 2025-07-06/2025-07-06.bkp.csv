Lando Norris won a chaotic British Grand Prix on Sunday, safely navigating a rain-hit race punctuated by several safety cars and taking advantage of his teammate Oscar Piastri incurring a 10-second penalty when one of those safety cars pulled off the track.
    


            Norris only led for the last few laps at Silverstone, having remained largely anonymous for much of the race.
    


            It was Piastri who set the pace almost all afternoon until his challenge was undone when he slammed on the brakes too forcefully as the safety car peeled off and picked up a 10-second penalty from the stewards.
    


            That left Norris as the winner-elect, providing he could complete the race cleanly – a difficult task in the inclement weather conditions that caused several drivers to lose control and spin off the track.
    


            “It's beautiful,” he told broadcaster Sky Sports afterward. “Everything I dreamed of, I guess. Everything I have ever wanted to achieve. Apart from a championship, I think this is as good as it gets in terms of feelings, in terms of achievement, being proud, all of it.
    


            “This is where it all started for me, was actually watching you on TV many years ago. And now, thankfully, I've been able to have my go.”
    


            By finishing first, Norris closed the gap to Piastri in the drivers' world championship and is now only eight points behind his teammate.
    


            Piastri held on for second while Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg claimed his first ever F1 podium in his 239th race, despite starting in 19th on the grid.
    


            “Nico, Nico, Nico,” his team shouted as they mobbed him afterwards, finally celebrating a podium for the German driver who holds the record for the most races completed without ever finishing in the top three.
    


            “What a race, coming from virtually last,” he told Sky Sports. “It's pretty surreal, to be honest. Not sure how it all happened, but obviously crazy conditions, mixed conditions. It was a survival fight for a lot of the race.”
    


            From the very start, it was an action-packed race with Mercedes' George Russell and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc among those pitting to change their tires before the race began.
    


            On pole, Max Verstappen started cleanly but, behind him, Liam Lawson and Esteban Ocon collided, sending Lawson spinning off the track and causing a virtual safety car to be deployed.
    


            As soon as that virtual safety car ended, another one started when Gabriel Bortoleto had to abandon his car as he tried to limp back to the pits. Once that one finished, and the racing got going, Verstappen and Piastri battled for first place – Verstappen ducking and weaving all over the track to defend his position, though ultimately Piastri passed the Red Bull driver relatively easily.
    


            Rain began falling shortly afterwards and, after complaining about his tires not gripping the track, Verstappen slid wide, letting Norris through as well. All top three drivers pitted shortly afterward but Norris endured a slow pit stop, conceding second place back to Verstappen.
    


            The rain got heavier, the cars kicked up so much spray, and the conditions deteriorated so much that a full safety car was deployed.
    


            Then, as the race got back underway, visibility remained so poor that Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar accidentally drove into the back of Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli, crumpling the Frenchman's car and causing yet another safety car to come out.
    


            Led by Piastri, with Verstappen close behind, the drivers bunched up again. As the safety car began pulling off, Piastri started trying to outfox Verstappen but he braked so sharply that the Dutchman accidentally overtook him. Then, Piastri accelerated away and Verstappen spun out trying to match the Australian, slipping from second to 10th place.
    


            The stewards noted the controversial incident and hit the McLaren driver with the penalty that cost him the race.
    


            “I'm not going to say much. I'll get myself in trouble. Well done to Nico, I think that's the highlight of the day,” Piastri told Sky Sports. “Apparently you can't brake behind the safety car anymore.”
    


            Although Piastri remained running out front, his days as the race leader were numbered as he was unable to build up an advantage of more than 10 seconds over Norris. Eventually, McLaren pitted him and Norris took the lead, becoming tearful over the radio when he won his home race.
    


            Verstappen moved himself back up and finished in fifth place while Lewis Hamilton finished in fourth.

Follow:


            There is a Diogo Jota performance that many Liverpool supporters will remember above all others.
    


            In October 2022, with the Reds struggling badly for form, Jota and Co. came up against a Manchester City team that would go on to win a historic treble that season.
    


            A month before the 2022 men's World Cup – the tournament Jota later said was “one of his dreams” to play in – many players might have taken it easy for fear of injuring themselves.
    


            Not Jota.
    


            The Portuguese forward did not contribute a goal or an assist, but he played 100 minutes and battled to win the ball back on countless occasions. Liverpool won 1-0, but Jota's tireless performance saw him go down with an injury in the final minute. He would go on to miss the World Cup.
    


            With the tournament set to come around again next year, Jota would very likely have finally fulfilled that dream in 2026.
    


            That opportunity, along with the far more important chance to experience life as a young father and newlywed, was cruelly snatched from the 28-year-old on Thursday morning when he and his brother, André Silva, died in a car crash in northwestern Spain.
    


            Maybe Jota would have avoided the injury against Manchester City if he had stayed out of the difficult tackles. But that is not the kind of player he was.
    


            “The way he played the game was full of this sort of scampering energy. … He would hunt the ball down aggressively, and he'd hunt space down aggressively.” Neil Atkinson, CEO and host of The Anfield Wrap, told CNN Sports' Amanda Davies.
    


            Jota's technical gifts – while remarkably apparent at times – were not on the level of those of some of his teammates. But it was that willingness to fight that made him such a popular figure on Merseyside, and the reason why it has been difficult to go to a Liverpool game in the last few years and not hear the crowd's famous song for him.
    


            “They loved that work ethic, that sheer desire, and the fact that he had almost a sense of mischief about him in the manner of his goals as well,” Atkinson said. “And I think that very much endeared him to the supporters.”
    


            The Portuguese international was vocal about his philosophy of hard work on the pitch.
    


            “As a fan – I was a fan myself – you want to see a player fighting for the club, for the badge that they both love,” he said in a video which was released by Liverpool on Thursday following the news of his death.
    


            But that tenacity was not just limited to his attitude on the field. As a young player struggling for games at one of the biggest clubs in the world – Atlético Madrid – the forward opted to join Wolverhampton Wanderers, a team which, at that time, was in the Championship, the second tier of English soccer.
    


            His bravery was rewarded as he became one of the best players in the team, eventually signing for Liverpool in 2020.
    


            It was at Liverpool where Jota appeared to find particular kinship with a city that, like him, has often had to fight.
    


            In 1981, after riots began in Liverpool as a result of tensions between police and the Black community, then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was secretly urged by her finance minister, Geoffrey Howe, to pursue a policy of “managed decline” with reference to the city.
    


            According to Howe, spending public money on the city would be like “trying to make water flow uphill.”
    


            Eight years later, when the Hillsborough disaster claimed the lives of 97 Liverpool supporters at an FA Cup semifinal, the city once again felt the brunt of the establishment.
    


            Both the local police and some sections of the British media blamed Liverpool fans. Despite tireless campaigning by the victims' families, it would take until 2016 for an inquest to rule that those who died were unlawfully killed and that fan behavior did not cause or contribute to the disaster.

With another glorious moment marred by tragedy, Liverpool and its supporters find strength in a familiar place – each other



            Liverpool is a club that has had more than its fair share of tragedy. Less than six weeks ago, a car rammed into a crowd of people at a parade to celebrate the club's Premier League title win, injuring dozens of people, including children.
    


            In the face of this latest tragedy Thursday morning, the city will once again come together to grieve.
    


            “The only way to get through this is to get through it together,” Atkinson said.
    


            The importance of that collectiveness was echoed by another Liverpool fan, Sally – who did not give her surname when she spoke to CNN Sports' Matias Grez outside Anfield on Thursday.
    


            “You stick together because that's the only way it's going to work,” she said. “That's the community spirit. It's not just Liverpool, it's Everton as well. Rivalries aside, times like this everyone comes together. It doesn't matter who you support.”
    


            Indeed, among the hundreds of scarves, flowers and messages that were left for Jota and his brother outside Anfield, items laid by fans of Everton, Liverpool's local rival, were visible.
    


            “I'm not really a massive one for social media, so I hadn't seen any of what I'm now seeing in front of me,” another supporter, Simon Walker, told CNN in reference to the tributes left at the stadium. “But I'm not surprised in the slightest because this is how this club and this city operates.”
    


            To say that Jota – a man who grew up in a small town outside Porto, 886 miles (1426 kilometers) away – fit well in Liverpool would be an understatement.
    


            That affinity extended to some of the less-Portuguese pastimes. In tribute posts on social media, former teammates Andy Robertson and Caoimhín Kelleher both referenced their surprise at Jota's enjoyment of darts and horse racing, with Robertson even jokingly referring to him as “Diogo MacJota.”
    


            “You could relate to him,” Sally, the Liverpool supporter who spoke to CNN, said Thursday. “You could tell he was a down-to-earth fella. He was very humble. He wasn't showy-offy. He was just very much a family man.
    


            “I think that's what relates everyone in the city to him, because we're all like a family.”
    


            The funeral for the 28-year-old and his brother took place in their hometown of Gondomar on Saturday morning. The pain that their family, Jota's wife and their three children are experiencing far exceeds that of those who marveled from afar at his performances on a soccer pitch.
    


            But it is a testament to Jota's spirit and tenacity that Liverpool too is grieving the loss of one of its most beloved sons.

South Korea is launching a sweeping cash handout program, offering what officials have described as “consumption coupons” to boost domestic spending and reinvigorate the country's sluggish economy, the Korea Herald has reported.

The initiative is part of a 31.8 trillion-won ($23.3 billion) supplementary budget passed by the National Assembly on Friday. The program is scheduled to begin on July 21 and run through September 12.

“We will ensure thorough preparations for the rollout of these payments so that they can serve as a catalyst for economic recovery by boosting consumption and supporting those in need,” Vice Interior Minister Kim Min-jae, who leads the interagency task force overseeing the initiative, said.

All citizens residing in South Korea as of June 18 will receive a one-time payment of 150,000 won ($110). Disbursements will be made via credit or debit cards, prepaid cards, or local government-issued gift certificates.

Additional support will target vulnerable groups. Near-poverty households and single-parent families will receive 300,000 won ($220), and recipients of the basic living allowance will get 400,000 won ($290). Those living in rural areas will receive an additional 50,000 won to promote “balanced regional development,” according to the Interior Ministry.

A second round of payments, planned for September 22 to October 31, will provide 100,000 won ($73) to the bottom 90% of income earners. Eligibility will be determined based on national health insurance premiums, with details to be announced in September.

South Korea, Asia's fourth-largest economy, narrowly avoided a technical recession in 2024 as growth stalled in the second half of the year, following a contraction in the second quarter and a weak recovery in the third. The downturn has been widely attributed to domestic political instability, culminating in the impeachment of then-President Yoon Suk Yeol on insurrection charges after he briefly imposed martial law in December.

Newly elected President Lee Jae-myung, who took office on June 4, introduced a stimulus package that includes cash assistance and digital vouchers, and pledged investment in AI infrastructure to promote growth.

Some economists, however, have warned of possible inflationary effects and long-term risks to fiscal health, since the Finance Ministry plans to fund the stimulus measures through new debt, projecting a fiscal deficit of 4.2% and national debt at 49.1% of GDP.

Slovakia is “ready to fight” for its right to import Russian gas and will continue to block Brussels' proposals to phase out Russian energy, Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Saturday.

Fico stressed that energy security is a strategic priority for Slovakia, and that EU efforts to change its supply mix threaten national sovereignty.

Slovakia vetoed the EU's 18th round of sanctions on Russia for the second time on Friday, citing concerns over the RePowerEU plan, which seeks to cut Russian energy imports by 2028. The plan is being discussed alongside sanctions targeting Russia's energy and financial sectors.

Brussels is seeking to pass the phase-out as trade legislation – requiring only a qualified majority. Fico insists, however, that the plan amounts to sanctions and must be unanimously approved. He previously warned that the move could jeopardize energy security, raise prices, and trigger costly arbitration with Gazprom over Slovakia's long-term energy contract.

Speaking during celebrations for Slovakia's Saints Cyril and Methodius Day, Fico called the phase-out plan a “disruption” of Slovakia's national interests.

“We refuse to support another sanctions package against the Russian Federation, unless we know who will protect us, and how, and compensate for the damage that will be caused to Slovakia by the ideological proposal of the European Commission to stop supplies of Russian gas,” he said.

“Slovakia wants to be sovereign and self-determined. And we must answer whether we are ready to fight for it. I am ready to fight this difficult battle. We are going to get through it.”

Fico added that vetoing the phase-out means “fighting for our households and businesses” so they won't bear the costs of “harmful ideological decisions” from Brussels.

He went on to say that Slovakia is at a crossroads – between giving in to pressure from “bureaucratic structures” in Brussels and defending its interests. He urged the public to choose the latter and accused the EU of ignoring national interests and violating international law by forcing harmful policies onto member states. Fico argued that Slovakia must pursue cooperation “based on equality and mutual benefit,” not external political agendas.

Hungary has also blocked the Russian energy phase-out plan, with Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto warning that it would “destroy Hungary's energy security” and cause price spikes.

Moscow has condemned the Western sanctions as illegal and counterproductive, particularly those targeting energy, noting that energy prices in the EU surged after the initial sanctions on Russia were introduced in 2022. Russian officials warn that the EU's rejection of Russian supplies will push it toward more expensive imports or rerouted Russian energy via intermediaries.

MOSCOW, July 6. /TASS/. Russia and the United States have historically maintained good relations, as the two countries were able to find things that bonded them together, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with Russian television host Pavel Zarubin.

""We have always had, for a very long time, very good and special relations with the United States. We supported their aspirations for independence from the UK. We actually supplied weapons. We helped them with money,"" he said. ""Afterward, we supported the North during the North-South war.""

As the American colonies fought against the UK, Russia maintained neutrality that played an important role in the outcome of those hostilities. Russia also supported the legitimate government in Washington after the secession of the southern states in 1861.

There are just two days of talks left before the US president's potentially swingeing tariffs are restored

The EU is entering a crunch week with only two days of talks left to secure a trade deal with Washinton to avert Donald Trump's threatened 50% tariff on its imports into the US.

According to the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, on Friday, the negotiations – which continued over the weekend – are focussed on 15 to 18 agreements with important partners, while Trump warned of import tax rates of up to 70% on others.

The uncertainty created by Washington has sent shock waves through the global economy. Businesses have paused investment and the dollar posted its worst performance in 50 years in the first half of the year.

With the clock ticking down to Trump's 9 July deadline, the European Commission remains uncertain how he will treat the bloc, threatening €1.6tn of transatlantic trade.

“Among member states, the big question will be whether we should reach a deal at all costs to avoid a trade war, or show muscle if the deal is not good enough,” one EU diplomat said.

The German chancellor, , has said he wants a quick UK-style deal to avert a full-scale trade war, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, favours holding out for a better deal if a rushed deal is “imbalanced”.

Giving a flavour of the aggression shown towards the EU, which Trump once called “nastier than China”, Brussels' trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, was threatened last week with 17% tariffs on food imports during talks with senior members of the Trump administration including Bessent.

After announcing punitive “liberation day” tariffs on nearly all countries on 2 April, Trump paused them for 90 days a week later.

The US is now on the brink of launching a trade assault on dozens of countries as the 90-day period expires on Wednesday with only two deals in the bag – the UK and Vietnam.

This has raised questions about the EU's ability to strike anything other than a political framework agreement to extend talks while a baseline 10% tariff and other levies on cars, steel and aluminium remain in place.

As talks move into the final and most sensitive stage, industries across Europe are bracing themselves for fresh challenges, deal or no deal. They expect the cost of Trump's presidency will be the minimum 10% on exports to the US, five times higher than the 2% average before he was elected last year.

That is because after months of threats of retaliatory tariffs on everything from Bourbon to Boeing aircraft, the EU conceded last week that a comprehensive trade deal was unattainable.

Instead they are aiming for an agreement in principle, or “framework deal” which will look more like the UK deal struck in May, which came into force at the end of last month.

Many EU diplomats initially dismissed the UK deal as thin and legally dubious under World Trade Organization rules, and held out hope that the bloc's greater economic clout with €1.6tn of transatlantic trade compared with the UK's £314bn (€363bn) would help it secure a better deal. But now they realise a bare-bones deal may be the best they can get.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Benedict Kuria was ambushed by suspected gang members in March while serving in security mission

The relatives of a Kenyan police officer who went missing while working in Haiti have spoken of their anguish and anger at Kenyan authorities over a lack of definitive information about what has happened to him.

Benedict Kuria and some colleagues were ambushed in March by suspected gang members. Haitian media reported that he had died, but Kenya's police service says a search is continuing.

“We've tried many times to get information from the government, but they've refused,” said Kuria's wife, Miriam Watima. “We don't know what to do any more.”

Hundreds of Kenyan officers have been posted to Haiti as part of a US and UN-backed mission to help police in the Caribbean country get to grips with rampant gang violence. More than a million people have been forced from their homes in a relentless cycle of indiscriminate killings, kidnappings, gang rapes and arson.

Kuria's case has reignited public concern over Kenya's involvement in the multinational security support mission (MSS), which started last year and was the subject of intense domestic public and legal scrutiny from the outset.

In a search for answers, Kuria's family filed a court petition in June that listed the attorney-general, the inspector general of police and various ministers as respondents. A Nairobi court has scheduled a preliminary court appearance for September but the family, who want the matter treated with urgency, have called for the session to be brought forward.

“We entrusted our son with the government,” said Kuria's mother, Jacinta Kabiru. “They should give us the information.”

Kuria, a 33-year-old administration police officer, joined the MSS last July. On 26 March the MSS said he was “unaccounted for” after an ambush the day before on a team who had gone to assist the recovery of a Haitian police vehicle stuck in a ditch that it suspected had been dug by gangs.

Later on 26 March, Kenyan police said a search and rescue mission was continuing, while local leaders and police chiefs went to Watima's house in the town of Kikuyu, north-west of Nairobi in Kiambu county, to tell her that her husband was missing.

But the following day, Haitian media outlets reported that Kuria had been killed, quoting Haiti's presidential transitional council as saying that he “fell … while carrying out his mission” and “gave his life for a better future for our country”.

In the months since, his family's desperate scramble for clarity has included visits to police – who have told them a search and rescue mission is continuing – and politicians' offices. Through their lawyer, Mbuthi Gathenji, they have petitioned parliament and written letters to Kenya's attorney-general and María Isabel Salvador, the special representative of the UN secretary-general in Haiti.

Their court petition accuses government officials of “refusing and/or neglecting” to provide the family with information on Kuria's whereabouts “to ease their agony”, and asks judges to assist in “compelling the respondents to disclose information”.

“You can imagine the pain that the parents and relatives are going through,” said Gathenji. “We are asking the government to come out with finality.”

The Guardian has approached Kenya's interior cabinet secretary as well as the MSS and the Kenyan police for comment.

Kenya's leading role in the mission stemmed from a desire by the US and the UN to restructure international intervention in Haiti with a multinational mission headed by an African country, after a series of floundering UN missions during which UN troops caused a cholera outbreak and peacekeepers were accused of sexual assault.

Kenya, which has participated in many peacekeeping missions internationally, volunteered to lead the Haiti intervention. For its president, William Ruto, the deployment was a chance to position his country as a reliable international partner and burnish the reputation of its police force, which regularly uses violence against civilians.

The arrival of the Kenyan officers in June 2024 brought some hope to Haiti, but the mission, beset by funding, equipment and personnel issues, has failed to repel the criminal advance.

In April, Salvador said Haiti was approaching a “point of no return”. And on Wednesday, Ghada Waly, the executive director of the UN office on drugs and crime, told the UN security council that gangs now controlled an estimated 90% of the capital, Port-au-Prince.

Kuria's mother had tried to dissuade him from joining the mission after learning about Haiti's violent reputation, but he was determined to go, motivated in part by the extra pay the job came with, which he planned to use to improve his relatives' lives. “This is an opportunity we have got as a family,” his brother, Philip Kuria, recalled him saying.

Kuria was due to return this year at the end of his one-year contract. “It's a struggle,” said Philip. “What we want is closure.”

Kuria's uncle, Daniel Ndung'u, said the family was open to any news. “My prayer is that he's going to come back to join us,” he said. “This suspense is actually torturing us.”

Watima recalled her last call with Kuria as they discussed academic plans for their 17-year-old daughter. She tops up credit for her husband's phone so it doesn't get deactivated, hoping that one day he'll call again. In the meantime, she waits for the government. “They should tell us whether he's alive or not,” she said. “That's all we want to know.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The rules of the institutions that define our lives bend like reeds when it comes to Israel – so much that the whole global order is on the verge of collapse

Sereen Haddad is a bright young woman. At 20 years old, she just finished a four-year degree in psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in only three years, earning the highest honors along the way. Yet, despite her accomplishments, she still can't graduate. Her diploma is being withheld by the university, “not because I didn't complete the requirements”, she told me, “but because I stood up for Palestinian life.”

Haddad, who is Palestinian American, had been raising awareness on her campus about the Palestinian fight for freedom as part of her university's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. The struggle is also personal for her. With roots in Gaza, she has lost more than 200 members of her extended family to Israel's war.

She was part of a group of VCU students and supporters who attempted to set up an encampment in April 2024. The university called in the police that same night. Protestors were pepper sprayed and brutalized, and 13 were arrested. Haddad was not charged, but she was taken to the hospital “because of the head trauma that I endured”, she told me. “I was bleeding. I was bruised. Cuts everywhere. The police slammed me down on the concrete, like, six different times.”

But last year's attempted encampment wasn't even the reason Haddad's degree is being withheld. This year's peaceful memorial of it was. And how that scenario played out, with the university and campus police constantly changing the rules, illustrates something worrisome far beyond the leafy confines of an American campus.

Israel's war in Gaza is chipping away at so much of what we – in the United States but also internationally – had agreed upon as acceptable, from the rules governing our freedom of speech to the very laws of armed conflict. It seems no exaggeration to say that the foundation of the international order of the last 77 years is threatened by this change in the obligations governing our legal and political responsibilities to each other.

This collapse began with the liberal world's lack of resolve to rein in Israel's war in Gaza. It escalated when no one lifted a finger to stop hospitals being bombed. It expanded when mass starvation became a weapon of war. And it is peaking at a time when total war is no longer viewed as a human abhorrence but is instead the deliberate policy of the state of Israel.

The implications of this collapse are profound for international, regional and even domestic politics. Political dissent is repressed, political language is policed, and traditionally liberal societies are increasingly militarized against their own citizens.

Many of us disregard how much has shifted in the last 20 months. But we are ignoring the collapse of the international system that has defined our lives for generations at our own collective peril.

On 29 April 2025, a group of VCU students met on a campus lawn to remember the forcible dismantling of an encampment briefly erected on the same space the year prior. The gathering was not a protest. It was more akin to a picnic, with some students using banners from past demonstrations as blankets. Others brought actual blankets. Students sat on the grass and studied for their finals, tinkered with their laptops, and played cards or chess. A handful of the 40-odd students sported keffiyehs.

It turned out the blankets were a problem.

Almost two hours into their picnic, a university administrator confronted the students over a social media post that had advertised the gathering. (“Come be in community with one another to commemorate 1 Year since VCU's brutal response to the G4Z4 Solidarity Encampment. Bring picnic blankets, homework/finals, art supplies, snacks, music, games,” a local Palestinian solidarity group had posted.) Because of this post, the university considered the picnic an “organized event”, and since the students hadn't registered the event, it was deemed a violation of the rules.

The rules at VCU had been changing because of protests for Gaza since February 2024.

The administrator told the students they could relocate to the campus free-speech zone, an area that had been established in August 2024 because of the protests of that year. “An amphitheater next to four dumpsters” is how Haddad described the area to me.

The campus free-speech organization Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire) is critical of free-speech zones because they “function more like free speech quarantines, banishing student and faculty speakers to outposts that may be tiny, on the fringes of campus, or (frequently) both”.

Rather than move, the students announced a formal end to their gathering, and they remained quietly on their campus lawn. But since the banners they were sitting on expressed a political point of view, the administrator told the students they would have to take them to the free-speech zone, according to Haddad. The lawn should be for everybody, the students countered. Several different conversations with campus police officers and different administrators ensued, with the students being told different rules each time.

Over a dozen campus police officers appeared later that afternoon (as seen in this video). “You've been asked not to have any blankets in the park. You have one minute to collect the blankets and to leave the park. Otherwise, you will be arrested for trespassing,” an officer told them.

But the police continued to change the rules. First the students were told they would have to roll up the blankets and leave. Minutes later, police said they could stay if the blankets were gone. The students removed the blankets and, as the officers were leaving, the students began chanting: “Free, free Palestine!” One raised a sign, referencing last year's protestors being pepper sprayed by police, that read: “Gonna gas us again, you fucking monsters.” He was arrested. The others became angry and frustrated.

“You know what made this a demonstration?” a student yelled at the police. “When you bring fucking cops to a picnic! That's what turns it into a fucking demonstration!”

Eight days later, Haddad and another student, identified by the university as leaders, were served notice of policy violations due to the unauthorized gathering. Their degrees were being withheld.

“When students expose the violence of Israel's occupation and genocide, institutions like VCU, which are deeply entangled with weapon manufacturers and corporate donors, become fearful,” Haddad said. “So they twist the rules, they rewrite the policies, and they try to silence us … But it's all about power. Our demands for justice are a threat to their complicity.”

The strategic rewriting of the rules isn't unique to VCU. It's taking place across the United States as university administrators clamp down on protests supporting Palestinian rights. In one of many other examples, dozens of faculty members and students were temporarily suspended from Harvard's library in late 2024 after they sat quietly reading in the library with signs that either supported free speech or opposed the war in Gaza, though a similar protest in December 2023 carried no such sanction.

Had any of these students been protesting Russia's war on Ukraine, you can be sure these administrations would have responded with adulation. Universities, after all, pride themselves on being the testing grounds for society's collective values. As sites of contemplation and exploration, they function as incubators for future leaders.

But when it comes to the question of Palestine, a different pattern begins to emerge. Rather than listen to students who want to hold Israel accountable for its actions, those in positions of power in the university are opting to change the rules instead.

Such dubious rule changes are not just for our students. In a damning report published in January, ProPublica dissected the many ways that the Biden administration kept shifting the goalposts in Israel's favor after 7 October 2023. Remember the threats of sanctions against Israel for invading Rafah? (It's a “red line,” Biden said.) Or the 30-day ultimatum placed on Israel to dramatically increase the food aid? But nothing happened. Outside briefly pausing a shipment of 2,000lb (0.9 tonne) bombs, the military hardware kept on coming.

The Leahy law requires restricting assistance to military units of foreign governments engaged in gross human rights violations. It has never been applied to Israel. In April 2024, it looked like secretary of state Antony Blinken was about to sanction Netzah Yehuda, a notorious battalion in the Israeli Defense Forces, under the Leahy law. In the end, he punted, and the battalion not only escaped US sanctions, but according to CNN, its commanders were even assigned to train ground troops and run operations in Gaza.

“It's hard to avoid the conclusion that the red lines have all just been a smokescreen,” Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard Kennedy School, told ProPublica. “The Biden administration decided to be all in and merely pretended that it was trying to do something about it.”

Leahy isn't the only US law that Israeli impunity is pushing to a breaking point. In late April 2024, the US government's leading agencies on humanitarian assistance concluded that Israel was deliberately blocking entry of food and medicine into Gaza. The US Foreign Assistance Act requires the government to suspend military assistance to any country that “restricts, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian assistance”. Blinken just ignored the evidence provided by his own government. “We do not currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of US humanitarian assistance,” he informed Congress.

The rules bend like reeds when it comes to Israel, which in March 2025 also broke the ceasefire that the Trump administration had helped negotiate in January. And now we are witnessing a new level of cruelty: the use of starvation as a weapon of war. Meanwhile Israeli politicians openly call for ethnic cleansing. Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right finance minister, bragged that Israel is “destroying everything that's left of the Gaza Strip” and that “the army is leaving no stone unturned.” He added: “We are conquering, cleansing and remaining in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed.” And his idea of Hamas is expansive. “We're eliminating ministers, bureaucrats, money handlers – everyone who holds up Hamas's civilian rule,” he explained. Killing civilian members of government (as they are not combatants) is a war crime.

The US and the international community, again, do nothing.

Every day, the previously unheard of is not just spoken aloud but also acted upon – precisely because it elicits little reaction. Two retired Israeli air force pilots wrote in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz's Hebrew edition that “a member of the Knesset even boasted that one of the [Israeli] government's achievements is the ability to kill 100 people a day in Gaza without anyone being shocked” (an excerpt of the Haaretz article was quoted by columnist Thomas Friedman in the New York Times.)

This steady shift of the acceptable has resulted in criminal policies and practices of forcible displacement, mass suffering and genocide, all conducted under passive acquiescence or active complicity of powerful countries. Even the normally reticent Red Cross is speaking out in horror. “Humanity is failing in Gaza,” Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, president of the International Committee for the Red Cross, told the BBC's Jeremy Bowen recently. “The fact that we are watching a people being entirely stripped of its human dignity should really shock our collective conscience,” she lamented.

Yet, official outrage is at best muted as all that was once considered institutionally solid melts into air.

What is it about Israel that enables it to get away with murder? The United States has long shielded Israel from international criticism and supported it militarily. The reasons offered for that support usually range from the “unbreakable” bond shared between the two countries to the power of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) in Washington. One could reasonably argue that the only thing different about this current war is the scale.

But it's not just Washington. Israel and the question of Palestine produce incredibly fraught divisions throughout much of the western world. Denmark recently banned children gearing up to vote in a nationwide youth election from debating Palestinian sovereignty. Why?

In a conversation with the New York Times' Ezra Klein, professor of international human rights law Aslı Bâli offered one explanation for what's different about Palestine. In 1948, she notes, Palestine was “the only territory that had been slated to be decolonized at the creation of the United Nations … that has [still] not been decolonized”.

South Africa was once in that category. For decades, Palestine and South Africa were “understood as ongoing examples of incomplete decolonization that continued long after the rest of the world had been fully decolonized”. Today, Palestine is the last exception to that historical process – a holdover plainly clear to the people who were once subject to colonization, but that the western world refuses to acknowledge as an aberration.

In other words, for many in the US and much of the western world, the creation of the state of Israel is understood as the fulfillment of Jewish national aspirations. For the rest of the world, the same fulfillment of Jewish national aspirations has rendered the decolonization of Palestine incomplete.

In 2003, the historian Tony Judt wrote that the “problem with Israel [is] … that it arrived too late. It has imported a characteristically late-19th-century separatist project into a world that has moved on, a world of individual rights, open frontiers, and international law. The very idea of a ‘Jewish state' – a state in which Jews and the Jewish religion have exclusive privileges from which non-Jewish citizens are forever excluded – is rooted in another time and place. Israel, in short, is an anachronism.”

Judt's idea that Israel is a relic of another era requires understanding how the global push for decolonization significantly accelerated after 1945. The result was a new world – but one that forsook the Palestinians, leaving them abandoned in refugee camps in 1948. This new world, emerging out of the ashes of the second world war, became what we today call “the rules-based international order”, of which international law is a key component.

International law became much more codified in this time as well. The year 1948 was not only the date of the Palestinian Nakba (Arabic for “catastrophe:) and Israel's independence. It was also the year that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was passed. Along with the UN Charter of 1945, the UDHR serves as the principal basis of international human rights law.

But what good is a “rules-based international order” if the rules keep shifting?

The truth is that we've never really lived in a “rules-based international order”, or at least not the one that most people imagine when they hear the phrase. The idea that international law establishes limits on the actions of states did not prevent the Rwandan genocide. The “rules-based international order” didn't stop the US's “illegal” invasion of Iraq in 2003. Long before 2023, Israel routinely violated Security Council resolutions. It didn't stop Hamas from committing its war crimes on 7 October.

The problem with international law is not just the lack of an enforcement mechanism to compel compliance of rogue states. The problem with international law is that “it is more likely to serve as a tool of the strong than of the weak,” the legal theorist Ian Hurd writes in his 2017 book, How to Do Things with International Law.

We tend to think of the law as an agreed-upon limit on our actions. As Dwight D Eisenhower famously said: “The world no longer has a choice between force and law. If civilization is to survive, it must choose the rule of law.”

But what if law is better understood as a system that, yes, restricts behavior but more importantly validates what's possible? Whoever gets to define the limits gets to define what's acceptable. As such, the powerful are far more likely to shift the ground of what's acceptable to their advantage. As Hurd explains, international law “facilitates empire in the traditional sense because strong states … shape the meaning of international rules and obligations through interpretation and practice”.

Though international law generally bans warfare, it carves out an exception for self-defense, and powerful states are the ones that can shift the line on what constitutes legitimate self-defense. (Israel broadly claims self-defense for its aggression on Iran, for example, as Russia explicitly claims self-defense for attacking Ukraine.) In his book, Hurd examines how the US has justified its use of drone warfare and even torture by appealing to international law. International law, for Hurd, is not a system that rests above politics. It is politics.

The point I take from Hurd is not that international law doesn't exist or that it's not valuable. Clearly, there's a need for rules to protect civilians and prevent war. International humanitarian law is also a living and breathing thing that adapts and expands. Additional protocols to the Geneva conventions were adopted in 1977. The Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court was passed in 1998.

But international law is also repeatedly put under stress, routinely violated, and consistently pushed into the service of strong states. As such, international law in practice is better understood as a constantly shifting line of acceptable behavior. We may now be reaching the point where that line has shifted so far from the founding intentions of international law that the system itself is on the brink of collapse.

Israel's campaign in Gaza carries the terrifying possibility of such a radical shifting of the line of acceptability that it makes genocide a lawful weapon of war. If you think I'm being hyperbolic, consider what Colin Jones wrote in the New Yorker earlier this year. Jones consulted key lawyers in the American military establishment about their views on Israel's campaign in Gaza. What he found was a US military that is deeply concerned about being hobbled by international law when prosecuting a future war against a major power such as China – so much so that Israel's “loosened restraints on civilian casualties” usefully shifts the goalposts for future US conduct.

To the US military, Jones writes: “Gaza not only looks like a dress rehearsal for the kind of combat US soldiers may face. It is a test of the American public's tolerance for the levels of death and destruction that such kinds of warfare entail.”

What future hell are we currently living in?

In his book, Hurd also illustrates a fundamental difference between domestic and international legal regimes. The expectation we have of domestic law, he says, is that it is “clear, stable, and known in advance”, whereas international law is up to the consent of states.

Trump's contempt for institutions of international law couldn't be clearer. He placed sanctions on judges and jurists of the International Criminal Court after arrest warrants were issued against Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. (He issued similar sanctions in 2020.) He defied the UN Charter by bombing Iran, a sovereign nation not posing an imminent risk to the United States. The global response? A mild rebuke from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and full-throated support from Nato secretary general Mark Rutte.

His disdain for domestic institutions of law is just as visible. He has invoked phony emergencies to claim “emergency powers” like no president before him, enabling him to get around Congress and, essentially, rule by decree. He deployed military troops in California, against the wishes of its governor, and an appeals court has even authorized his decision. He is walking the line of open defiance of various judicial orders.

What is happening? It's tempting to think that we are living in a new era of lawlessness, but that would fail to capture the change staring us in the face. This is not about the lack of law. It's about the remaking of the law. What Trump and leaders like him seek is not so much to destroy the law as to colonize it, to possess the law by determining its parameters to serve their interests. For them, the law exists to bend to their will, to destroy their adversaries, and to provide an alibi for behavior which, in a better version of our world, would be punished as criminal.

Maybe it's not surprising that something as vulnerable as international law could crack under today's pressures. What may be surprising is how we're also losing our domestic sense of stability, peace and security along with it and how connected the struggle for Palestine is to this domestic dismantling, especially when it comes to free expression. Just ask Sereen Haddad or Mahmoud Khalil, the Palestinian rights activist who spent 104 days in detention for his constitutionally protected political speech and still faces the prospect of deportation.

The convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide was, like the UDHR, approved in the fateful year of 1948. Its arrival was urgent and necessary after the Nazi Holocaust of the Jewish people, and modern international law was constructed on the understanding that together we in the international community would work together to prevent future genocides. While we have failed to live up to that promise in the past, today it is Israel's acts of extermination and genocide of Palestinians in Gaza, funded and enabled at every turn by a complicit west, that has contributed the most to the demise of the global, rules-based order. The way it looks today, the system won't make it to 100 years.

And its collapse can be directly attributed to the hypocrisy with which the world has treated the Palestinians. No other group has been subjected to such a prolonged state of loss in the post-1945 liberal order. Palestinian refugees constitute “the world's oldest and largest protracted refugee situation” in the modern world. And the demands placed on Palestinians simply to survive get more barbaric by the hour. In Gaza, desperate Palestinians are gunned down by snipers and drones daily as they wait for food. A drought is imminent because Israel's attacks have destroyed most of the strip's wastewater treatment plants, sewage systems, reservoirs and pipes. Up to 98% of Gaza's farmland has been destroyed by Israel. This is a form of total war the modern world should never see, let alone condone.

No one knows what will come to replace the international system that is currently collapsing around us, but any political system that prioritizes punishing those who protest genocide rather than stopping the killing has clearly exhausted itself.

If there's a glimmer of hope in all this rage-inducing misery, it can be found in the growing number of people around the world who refuse to be intimidated into silence. We may have seen a small example of that courage in New York City recently, and I'm not talking only about Zohran Mamdani winning the Democratic party nomination for mayor. That same day, two of Brooklyn's progressive politicians, Alexa Avilés and Shahana Hanif, were running for renomination. Both supported Palestine, both were relentlessly attacked for their positions on Gaza, and both refused to change their views. Pro-Israel donors poured money into their opponents' campaigns. Yet both handily won their races.

Multiple factors go into winning any political campaign, but any expressed support for Palestine used to be a death knell. Could it be that we're on the cusp of change? Maybe Palestinian freedom is no longer a liability but is now a real winning position in politics?

Palestine is perhaps the clearest expression today, as Haddad told me, of how “power feels threatened by the truth.” She continued: “If they are so afraid of a student with a sign or a chalked message or a demand for justice, then we are stronger than they want us to believe.” She better be right. For all our sakes.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Real Madrid's FIFA Club World Cup quarter-final against Borussia Dortmund had taken three crazy turns during nine minutes of second-half stoppage time when Marcel Sabitzer chested the ball and sent a right-footed volley toward Thibaut Courtois' post.

Courtois leapt to his right, extended the long arm on his 2m frame and just managed to get his gloved fingertips on the ball, knocking it down.

Courtois hit the ground as the ball bounded up. He looked skyward, planted his right hand to regain his balance, grabbed the ball with both hands on the second bounce and fell onto it with his chest.

Sabitzer turned his back to the goal and put both hands on his head as Brazilian referee Ramon Abatti walked by, raised both hands and blew the final whistle.

“In football, it's like this. All the teams that are here, they compete until the end,” Courtois said after Real's 3-2 victory on Saturday. “A game could become like this at any minute, and that's what happened at the end.”

Voted the top goalkeeper in 2018, Courtois has won a pair of UEFA Champions League titles with Real Madrid, along with two English Premier League championships and four in La Liga. 

“We are so lucky that we have Thibaut on goal because Thibaut is one of those ‘keepers that makes you win games, and today that save has been so decisive,” Madrid coach Xabi Alonso said.

Gonzalo Garcia and Fran Garcia scored in the first 20 minutes as Real Madrid built a 2-0 lead. Gonzalo Garcia is tying Benfica's Angel Di Maria and Al Hilal's Marcos Leonardo for the tournament lead with four goals.

“Not even in my best dreams did I think it would go this well,” said the 21-year-old Gonzalo Garcia, who played just five La Liga matches over the past two seasons.

Real Madrid's lead still stood when five minutes of stoppage time were signaled.

Dortmund's Maximilian Beier started the zaniness when he scored three minutes into stoppage time after Antonio Rudiger's failed clearance.

Kylian Mbappe, who entered in the 67th minute, restored a two-goal lead one minute later with a spectacular bicycle kick, beating goalkeeper Gregor Kobel from 6 yards from Arda Guler's long cross. 

Mbappe then held up two fingers with his right hand and formed a zero with his left as a tribute to Diogo Jota, flashing the No. 20 of the Liverpool player who died in a car crash on Thursday.

That was not all.

Serhou Guirassy converted a penalty kick in the eighth minute of added time after he was fouled by Dean Huijsen, who received a red card and would miss the semi-final.

Dortmund pushed for an equalizer. Courtois then came up with a stop for the ages.

“It is a great big save. That's the reason why he is the best goalkeeper in the world,” Dortmund coach Niko Kovac said.

Madrid advanced to a semi-final match against Champions League winner Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, a day after Chelsea meets the Brazilian club Fluminense.

“The nervousness, we need to learn to be more calm in the next game and finish the game in possession,” Courtois said.



                                                                                Spain are the favorites to win the UEFA Women's Euro 2025, but star player Aitana Bonmati's illness ahead of the tournament raises another question mark around a side which, despite their obvious quality, are not unstoppable. 
Having claimed the last two Ballon d'Or awards, Barcelona midfielder Bonmati is the game's biggest star at present, so her absence in the final days before the start of Euro 2025 is a major setback. 
The 27-year-old came down with a fever in training last week, and was subsequently hospitalized and diagnosed with viral meningitis. 
Bonmati was discharged on Sunday and joined up with                                    


HSIEH ADVANCES:
                                        In the women's doubles, Taiwan's Hsieh Su-wei was to play in the second round last night, but Taiwan's Ray Ho exited in the men's doubles                                        It is more than 10 years since Grigor Dimitrov reached his sole Wimbledon semi-final and back then it still seemed a reasonable bet that the Bulgarian once dubbed “Baby Federer” would win a Grand Slam title.
There were semi-final runs at the US Open and Australian Open after that, but it has never quite happened and despite him still being ranked No. 21, it most likely never will.
Dimitrov, 34, remains one of the most stylish players on the circuit though, with his elegant single-handed backhand and smooth all-court game a rare reminder of how tennis was before the power merchants turned                                    


TAIWANESE WIN:
                                        Chan Hao-ching and Wu Fang-hsien and their partners won their first-round matches in the women's doubles at the All England Lawn Tennis Club                                        Late-night finishes and five-set matches are becoming a habit for Taylor Fritz at Wimbledon this year.
On Wednesday, he wrapped up his win over Gabriel Diallo before the match was suspended — making sure the fifth-seeded American would not have to come back on court for a fourth straight day.
Fritz overcame a bloodied elbow to win 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/0), 4-6, 6-3 on No. 1 Court a day after he finished off another five-set win over Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in a match that was halted on Monday at about 10:15pm after Fritz forced a fifth set with Wimbledon's 11pm curfew looming.

Cole Palmer put Chelsea ahead in the 16th minute, but Estevao, an 18-year-old who is to transfer to Chelsea this summer, tied the score against his future club with an angled shot in the 53rd.
Gusto's shot following a short corner kick appeared to deflect off defender Agustin Giay and goalkeeper Weverton and sent the Chelsea portion of 65,782 fans into a frenzy.

Desire Doue scored in the 78th minute, and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) moved a step closer to another trophy with a 2-0 victory over Bayern Munich in the quarter-final of the FIFA Club World Cup on Saturday, a game marred by a gruesome injury to young German star Jamal Musiala.

With PSG two men down after a pair of late red cards and Bayern throwing everyone forward, Ousmane Dembele added an insurance goal deep into stoppage time to send the French powerhouse to the semi-finals on Wednesday against Real Madrid following their 3-2 win over Borussia Dortmund.

Dembele, whose goal was set up by Achraf Hakimi's brilliant dribbling through five Bayern defenders, celebrated by sitting with his legs crossed to honor Liverpool player Diogo Jota, who was killed along with his brother in a car wreck early on Thursday.

PSG, who claimed their first UEFA Champions League title with a 5-0 rout of Inter Milan five weeks ago, broke a scoreless deadlock when Joao Neves stole the ball from Harry Kane near the halfway line to send the French team sprinting toward the Bayern goal.

Neves got the ball back off a give-and-go and found Doue lurking just outside the top of the area. His left-footed shot caught Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer flat-footed as it skidded inside the right post.

However, PSG had to hold on for dear life to preserve the win after Willian Pacho and Lucas Hernandez were both sent off with red cards. Pacho was called for a reckless challenge, and Hernandez earned a red for doling out an elbow.

Bayern had two apparent goals flagged for offside, including a header by Kane. In the waning seconds, the German club was awarded a penalty kick, only to have it waved off after a video assistant referee review.

However, Musiala's sickening injury marred the outcome.

As he chased a loose ball near the end line in first-half stoppage time, PSG ‘keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma darted off his spot and dived for it — only to crash into the left ankle of the 22-year-old German. As Musiala rolled over, his foot dangled awkwardly, the ankle appearing to be cleanly broken.

Donnarumma walked away with the ball, but he knelt down in horror when he looked back and realized the seriousness of the injury. A stretcher was immediately summoned to take Musiala off the field.

Both teams walked toward the locker rooms in stunned silence, with the PSG ‘keeper appearing to be close to tears. He was booed throughout the second half by Bayern fans each time he touched the ball.

Bayern coach Vincent Kompany expressed outrage at the injury after the game. “I've rarely been so angry at half-time, not against my players. There's many things in life that are important, much more important than this, but in the end, for these guys, it's their life,” Kompany said.

“Someone like Jamal lives for this, and he came back from a setback, and then it happens in the way it happens and you feel powerless,” he said. 

“When I'm sat here next to you now, the thing that gets my blood still boiling at the moment, it's not the result. I understand this is football, but it's the fact that it happened to someone who, one, enjoys the game so much but also very important for us,” he added.



                                                                                Spain are the favorites to win the UEFA Women's Euro 2025, but star player Aitana Bonmati's illness ahead of the tournament raises another question mark around a side which, despite their obvious quality, are not unstoppable. 
Having claimed the last two Ballon d'Or awards, Barcelona midfielder Bonmati is the game's biggest star at present, so her absence in the final days before the start of Euro 2025 is a major setback. 
The 27-year-old came down with a fever in training last week, and was subsequently hospitalized and diagnosed with viral meningitis. 
Bonmati was discharged on Sunday and joined up with                                    


HSIEH ADVANCES:
                                        In the women's doubles, Taiwan's Hsieh Su-wei was to play in the second round last night, but Taiwan's Ray Ho exited in the men's doubles                                        It is more than 10 years since Grigor Dimitrov reached his sole Wimbledon semi-final and back then it still seemed a reasonable bet that the Bulgarian once dubbed “Baby Federer” would win a Grand Slam title.
There were semi-final runs at the US Open and Australian Open after that, but it has never quite happened and despite him still being ranked No. 21, it most likely never will.
Dimitrov, 34, remains one of the most stylish players on the circuit though, with his elegant single-handed backhand and smooth all-court game a rare reminder of how tennis was before the power merchants turned                                    


TAIWANESE WIN:
                                        Chan Hao-ching and Wu Fang-hsien and their partners won their first-round matches in the women's doubles at the All England Lawn Tennis Club                                        Late-night finishes and five-set matches are becoming a habit for Taylor Fritz at Wimbledon this year.
On Wednesday, he wrapped up his win over Gabriel Diallo before the match was suspended — making sure the fifth-seeded American would not have to come back on court for a fourth straight day.
Fritz overcame a bloodied elbow to win 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/0), 4-6, 6-3 on No. 1 Court a day after he finished off another five-set win over Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in a match that was halted on Monday at about 10:15pm after Fritz forced a fifth set with Wimbledon's 11pm curfew looming.

Screening people in their 40s for colorectal cancer significantly lowers incidence and mortality rates compared with starting screenings at 50, a National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) study has shown.

Taiwan has a high colorectal cancer incidence rate, with the rate among people aged 40 to 49 ranking among the top three globally, NTUH Health Management Center director Chiu Han-mo (邱瀚模) told a news conference on Thursday.

Colorectal cancer was the second-most common cancer in Taiwan in 2022, with 17,643 cases reported that year, behind lung cancer with 17,982 cases, Health Promotion Administration data showed.

“A few years ago, many people said we should wait to see what Western countries would do [to address the high incidence rate of colorectal cancer] before making our own decisions,” said Chiu, who is also an NTU College of Medicine clinical professor.

“But we believe Taiwan faces unique challenges [due to its relatively high rate of colorectal cancer among 40-to-49-year-olds] that must be addressed domestically. That is why we sought an evidence-based foundation to advance [the screening] policy,” he added.

Chiu's team analyzed 17 years of data from community-based screening programs, tracking more than 500,000 people in Keelung and Tainan.

Some of the study participants started receiving fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screenings between the ages of 40 and 49 through local government-funded programs, while others started at 50 under a central government scheme.

After two years studying and developing models based on those data, Chiu's team found that participants who started FIT screening in the 40-to-49 age group had a 21 to 25 percent lower risk of developing colorectal cancer and a 34 to 39 percent reduction in related deaths compared with those who started screenings at 50.

The study also found that for every 1,548 people screened before the age of 50, one case of colorectal cancer could be prevented — a significant improvement over the 2,079 needed when screening begins at age 50.

Screening helps detect precancerous lesions so they can be treated before developing into cancer, and also catches cancer early before it progresses to a late stage and leads to death, Chiu said.

Published on June 12 in JAMA Oncology, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Medical Association, the study is the world's first to provide real-world evidence of the benefits of early colorectal cancer screening.

It was accompanied in the journal by an editorial from three Harvard Medical School researchers highlighting the significance of the findings.

One of the Harvard researchers, Andrew Chan, said that in the US, data on earlier screening — such as beginning at age 40 — and on the use of FIT have been “lacking,” and Chiu's study is significant because it helps “address this important evidence gap.”

The study could be used to “support FIT screening in lower-resource settings where colonoscopy screening was not an option and provide additional evidence for us to potentially lower our screening age even further,” said Chan, who joined the news conference via videoconference.

Since Jan. 1, Taiwan has expanded eligibility for biennial government-subsidized FITs to include individuals aged 45 to 49, lowering the previous age range of 50 to 74.

People aged 40 to 44 with a family history of colorectal cancer are now eligible for the tests following the expansion.

Chiu welcomed the change, calling it highly cost-effective, as people aged 45 to 49 are a vital part of the workforce.

“If we can reduce their risk of developing colorectal cancer, the impact on the country would be tremendous,” he said.

The event, organized by the National Police Agency, aims to raise awareness about disaster preparedness ahead of nationwide air raid drills scheduled from July 15 to 18, which are part of broader urban resilience exercises.
The exhibition outlines the recommended actions people should take depending on whether they are indoors, commuting or outdoors when air-raid sirens sound. It also teaches people how to equip air-raid shelters and pack emergency ""go bags,"" with displays

The products, including frozen whole fish and pre- cooked fish belly, were dispatched from Jiangjun Fishing Harbor, where a new aquatic processing and logistics center is under construction.
At the launch, Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che (黃偉哲) called the move a “breakthrough,” marking Taiwan's expansion into the Singaporean tilapia market.
Taiwan's tilapia exports have traditionally focused on the United States, Canada, and the Middle East, Huang said, adding that the new foothold in

Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an (蔣萬安) told a ceremony to mark the opening of the facility that the city aims to fully electrify its bus fleet by 2030.
The number of electric buses has grown from about 650 last year to 886 this year and is expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year, Chiang said.
Setting up the charging station in a metro depot optimizes land and energy use, as the metro uses power mainly during the

As of 8am today, the system was located approximately 370 kilometers southwest of Taiwan's southern tip, Cape Eluanbi, and has developed a more organized structure, forecaster Lee Meng-hsuan (李孟軒) said.
The storm is currently moving slowly toward the Taiwan Strait in an east-northeast direction and may trigger a sea warning if it reaches tropical storm strength tomorrow morning.
The system is expected to shift direction later tomorrow toward the north                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

By Kodai Fujimoto / Yomiuri Shimbun Staff Writer

14:46 JST, July 6, 2025

Japanese literature specialist Susumu Nakanishi has published a book introducing the appeal of manyo nihonga, paintings inspired by works in Manyoshu, a compilation of classic waka poems of the eighth century.

The 95-year-old author of “Nakanishi Susumu to Manyoga o Tanoshimu” (Find enjoyment in manyo nihonga with Susumu Nakanishi), published by Tankosha Publishing, believes that poetry and painting are closely related. He talked about the pleasure of enjoying waka poetry together with paintings in an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun.

Manyo nihonga was created for the opening of the Nara Prefecture Complex of Man'yo Culture in Asuka, Nara Prefecture, in 2001. Nakanishi served as the complex's first director. The collection features work by 154 artists, including Matazo Kayama and Shoko Uemura. They depict landscapes and figures described in Japan's oldest anthology of poems. The ancient waka poetry and modern paintings meet and resonate with each other, creating vivid imagery.

Nakanishi said that adding pictures to poetry is something “essential” for human beings. The leading scholar of Manyoshu was a member of a university art club when he was a student.

“What you hear becomes literature, and what you see becomes pictures. Poetry and pictures are two sides of the same coin in terms of sensitivity, and, depending on the way we perceive nature, it becomes a picture or a poem,” he said.

Manyoshu is a collection of poems by a wide range of people, from emperors to commoners. Various areas in Japan serve as settings, with many being composed by people while traveling for leisure or for work.

For example, a poem by Yamabe no Akahito about snow-capped Mt. Fuji reads:

“Tagonoura yu / uchiidete mireba / mashiro niso / fuji no takane ni / yuki wa furikeru” (When going out along the shore of Tago and looking at the lofty peak of Mt. Fuji, I see white, glittering snow on top)

Inspired by this poem, Tamako Kataoka, in “Mt. Fuji Seen from Tagonoura,” boldly depicted the mountain with a halo of light.

“The painting depicts well the deep shock the people of that period, who were accustomed to rounded mountains, must have had when they saw the sharp figure of Mt Fuji. It depicts the sacredness of the mountain, too,” Nakanishi said. He said Kataoka did not paint the mountain as it was, but instead “broke down the concrete image of the mountain and reconstructed people's surprise.”

Nakanishi also talked about colors. Shunei Nishida painted “Losing My Way among Autumn Leaves,” inspired by a poem by Kakinomoto no Hitomaro, which reads:

“Akiyama no / momichi o shigemi / matoinuru / imo o motomen / yamaji shirazumo” (With the lush yellow leaves of autumn mountain, I wander the mountain path seeking my lost wife)

Nishida painted most of the canvas in red, depicting a landscape of autumn leaves.

“I was stunned by the bold blood-red color,” said Nakanishi. He also pointed to a small white waterfall painted in the background. Since ancient times, white has been considered a sacred color, and that is why he sees the waterfall as a symbol of an “unobtainable, pure white soul” that Hitomaro was seeking.

“While you stare at paintings, you begin to feel as if they grow eyes and stare back at you,” Nakanishi said.

The new book carries about 30 paintings and text by Nakanishi containing knowledge and thoughts about Manyoshu and columns by Sayaka Inoue, the planning and research section chief at the cultural facility. Written in simple yet profound language, the book serves as an introduction to the world of Manyoshu.

Nakanishi believes that the world of poetry, which conveys something more than facts, is indispensable for modern people. He compared it to “frills” on clothing. “They may not serve any practical purpose but can comfort people and soothe their hearts. The role of poetry is essential to human beings,” he said.

Poems in Manyoshu still stir the imaginations of people and touch their hearts. Manyo nihonga, which bring together the sensibilities of ancient and modern times, remind us of poetry's universal power.

Armenia's Foreign Ministry on July 5 denied claims by Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) that Russia was intensifying its military presence at the country's Gyumri base to exert greater influence in the South Caucasus, the media outlet News Armenia reported. 

The news comes amid a major deterioration in Russian-Azerbaijani relations after a deadly June 27 operation in Russia's Yekaterinburg, where Russian security forces killed two Azerbaijani nationals and injured several others in a raid linked to a 2001 murder case.

HUR claimed on July 5 that Russia was increasing its military presence in Gyumri and recruiting new troops for the base. Ukraine's military intelligence argued that the alleged move was aimed at ""destabilizing the global security situation."" 

Ani Badalyan, the Armenian Foreign Ministry's spokesperson, rejected the report. 

""In response to the fictitious information that appeared in the press, the Republic of Armenia reaffirms its principled position that the territory of the Republic of Armenia cannot be used by third states to carry out military actions against any of its neighboring states,"" she said, as cited by News Armenia. 

Armenia has had a historically close relationship with Russia but the relations between Yerevan and Moscow have recently deteriorated. 

Russia's leverage over both Baku and Yerevan has diminished dramatically since Azerbaijani troops captured Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-controlled region in Azerbaijan, in 2023.

Russian peacekeepers later withdraw from the region, and now Baku and Yerevan are negotiating a permanent peace deal.

Armenia, which has lambasted Moscow for failing to help it during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, is drifting closer to the West.

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has suspended the country's membership in a Russian-led military alliance and announced plans to join the European Union. Recently there has also been a crackdown on the pro-Russian opposition in Armenia.

Weeks after a high-profile public falling out with U.S. President Donald Trump, tech mogul Elon Musk announced the creation of a new political party in the United States, dubbed the ""America Party."" 

Musk said on July 5 that the party's aim is to ""give you back your freedom"" and challenge the traditional two-party Republican and Democratic system.

The announcement came a day after Trump signed his sweeping tax cut and spending bill into law, a legislative act that Musk has fiercely opposed. It remains unclear if the America Party has been formally registered with election authorities, but Musk indicated it would launch ""next year.""

Musk's decision follows a poll he conducted on X on July 4, asking his followers if he should create a new political party.He cited the overwhelming support, writing: ""By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it! When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy.""

The strained relationship between Musk and Trump began to deteriorate significantly after a period where Musk publicly supported Trump's re-election bid and held a high-profile role in the U.S. government's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). 

In May, Musk announced his departure from DOGE, citing the end of his ""scheduled time."" Initially, Trump praised him as ""one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced.""

However, tensions escalated sharply on May 22 after the U.S. House of Representatives passed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" a significant tax-cut and spending bill that Trump signed into law on Friday. 

Musk vehemently condemned the legislation, calling it a ""massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination."" He argued that the bill's spending would exacerbate the ""already gigantic budget deficit"" and ""burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.""

Adding to the friction earlier this week, Trump threatened to cut off billions of dollars in federal subsidies to Musk's companies and even hinted at the possibility of deporting the South Africa-born entrepreneur.

Four Alliance 90/Greens party members have sent an open letter to German Chancellor Friedrich Merz calling for a significant increase in military aid to Ukraine, Bild reported on July 5, citing a copy of the document.

The news comes as Russia's expanded drone production has enabled Moscow to launch as many as 500 drones in a single night against Ukraine on multiple occasions each week.

The letter's authors — Robin Wagener, Sara Nanni, Sebastian Schafer, and Anton Hofreiter — demanded that certain budget items be adjusted, particularly regarding support for Ukraine. They believe that the planned increase in Germany's defense funding for Kyiv from $8.4 billion in 2024 to $9.8 billion in 2025 is insufficient, according to Bild.

The signatories emphasized the need to strengthen Ukraine's air defense systems urgently.

""Without further air defense and assured supplies, Russian dictatorship over Ukraine becomes more likely,"" the letter read.

The lawmakers also noted that the situation has deteriorated as Russia continues to carry out large-scale attacks on Ukraine, and the United States, for its part, has partially suspended its military aid. 

The signatories reminded Merz that, thanks to the Greens party's support in the previous Bundestag, assistance to Ukraine had significantly increased. 

Before becoming chancellor, Merz, elected for the CDU/CSU conservative alliance, signaled he could overturn the ban of his predecessor, Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, on delivering Taurus to Ukraine.

The Taurus is a powerful cruise missile capable of striking targets at a distance of 500 kilometers (300 miles), more than the long-range capabilities Ukraine received from other partners.

However, the German government has not approved sending Taurus missiles to Ukraine so far. 

Ukraine has been using U.S.-made ATACMS for over a year, and U.K.-French Storm Shadow/SCALP for more than two, initially being allowed to deploy them only against Russian targets on Ukrainian territory.

Only in late 2024, the Biden administration and other allies eased the restrictions, allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian military targets on Russian territory.

The death toll from flash floods that rampaged through Central Texas rose to at least 67 on Sunday as rescuers maneuvering through challenging terrain found more bodies and continued their desperate search for many others, including 11 missing girls from a summer camp.

Searchers in Kerr County have found 16 bodies since Saturday afternoon, bringing the total number of dead there to 59, said Sheriff Larry Leitha. The dead included 21 children, he said.

He pledged to keep searching in that Hill Country region until “everybody is found” from Friday's flash floods.

Four deaths also were reported in Travis County, three in Burnet and 1 in Kendall.

Rescuers scoured a central Texas landscape of mangled trees, overturned cars and muck-filled debris on Sunday in an increasingly bleak mission to locate survivors after a historic flash flood.

Rescuers dealt with broken trees, overturned cars and muck-filled debris in the difficult task to find survivors. Authorities still have not said how many people were missing beyond the 11 children and a camp counselor from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp.

Families were allowed to look around the camp Sunday morning while nearby crews operating heavy equipment pulled tree trunks and tangled branches out of the water as they searched along a riverbank. Thunder rumbled from a new storm.

A woman and a teenage girl, both wearing rubber waders, briefly went inside one of the cabins, which stood next to a pile of soaked mattresses, a storage trunk and clothes. At one point, the pair doubled over, sobbing before they embraced.

Damage from natural disasters in Canada hit record $8.5-billion in 2024

With each passing hour, the outlook of finding more survivors became even more bleak. Volunteers and some families of the missing who drove to the disaster zone searched the riverbanks despite being asked not to do so.

Authorities faced growing questions about whether enough warnings were issued in area long vulnerable to flooding and whether enough preparations were made.

The destructive, fast-moving waters rose eight metres on the river in only 45 minutes before daybreak Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as flash flood watches remained in effect and more rain fell in central Texas on Sunday.

Searchers used helicopters, boats and drones to look for victims and to rescue people stranded in trees and from camps isolated by washed-out roads. Officials said more than 850 people were rescued in the first 36 hours.

Govenor Greg Abbott vowed that authorities will work around the clock and said new areas were being searched as the water receded. He declared Sunday a day of prayer for the state.

“I urge every Texan to join me in prayer this Sunday – for the lives lost, for those still missing, for the recovery of our communities, and for the safety of those on the front lines,” he said in a statement.

In Rome, Pope Leo XIV offered special prayers for those touched by the disaster. History's first American pope spoke in English at the end of his Sunday noon blessing, “I would like to express sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones, in particular their daughters who were in summer camp, in the disaster caused by the flooding of the Guadalupe River in Texas in the United States. We pray for them.”

The hills along the Guadalupe River are dotted with century-old youth camps and campgrounds where generations of families have come to swim and enjoy the outdoors. The area is especially popular around the Independence Day holiday, making it more difficult to know how many are missing.

“We don't even want to begin to estimate at this time,” Kerrville city manager Dalton Rice said on Saturday.

Survivors shared terrifying stories of being swept away and clinging to trees as rampaging floodwaters carried trees and cars past them. Others fled to attics inside their homes, praying the water wouldn't reach them.

At Camp Mystic, a cabin full of girls held onto a rope strung by rescuers as they walked across a bridge with water whipping around their legs.

Among those confirmed dead were an eight-year-old girl from Mountain Brook, Alabama, who was at Camp Mystic, and the director of another camp up the road.

Locals know the area as “flash flood alley” but the flooding in the middle of the night caught many campers and residents by surprise even though there were warnings.

The National Weather Service on Thursday advised of potential flooding and then sent out a series of flash flood warnings in the early hours of Friday before issuing flash flood emergencies – a rare alert notifying of imminent danger.

At the Mo-Ranch Camp in the community of Hunt, officials had been monitoring the weather and opted to move several hundred campers and attendees at a church youth conference to higher ground. At nearby Camps Rio Vista and Sierra Vista, organizers also had mentioned on social media that they were watching the weather the day before ending their second summer session Thursday.

Authorities and elected officials have said they did not expect such an intense downpour, the equivalent of months' worth of rain for the area.

U.S. Representative Chip Roy, whose district includes the ravaged area, acknowledged that there would be second-guessing and finger-pointing as people look for someone to blame.

As produce prices soar, self-reliant Canadians find joy growing their own vegetables and sharing the harvest

One hundred and fifty tomato plants blanketed Alea Cardarelli's front yard in Gatineau in the summer of 2022. 

The unconventional garden was born from a promise Ms. Cardarelli made to her husband: he'd never have to mow their patchy lawn again. 

Grocery prices for produce had grown exorbitant. Plus, it felt “sterile” buying tomatoes from a store in summer, Ms. Cardarelli said. So she turned to her sunny, south-facing front yard and began planting tomato seedlings. Midway through that first summer, her bounty surpassed 100 pounds.

“I had neighbours coming by asking what I was doing. They were all excited,” she said. Gifts from other gardeners appeared on her porch – a package of bulbs, a bundle of beans and herbs with a handwritten note. 

One day, an older biker arrived to her front yard garden. Clad in leather, an “Eff Trudope” patch stitched on his jacket, he cradled a monster-sized celery plant in his arms. Earlier in the summer, they'd talked about her trouble growing celery. So he uprooted one of his plants and brought it to her, accepting tomato seedlings in return. 

“And off he went. Never saw him again, but what a great moment,” said Ms. Cardarelli, a 47-year-old civil servant. “It's a softer life when you have a front garden. Talking about plants makes everybody kinder.”

Gardeners across Canada are ripping out their front lawns and planting productive vegetable gardens in their place. Some move to the front because it's sunniest there. Others with backyard vegetable gardens seek to expand their growing territory curbside. Some do it to save on inflated grocery prices and to feel self-reliant. Many talk excitedly about sharing their horticultural tips and harvests with new, unexpected friends out front.

Like pollinator gardens, the rise of food gardens signals a slow shift away from the front lawn − highly manicured and high-maintenance. For years, vegetables weren't considered attractive enough for the front of the house, with shorn grass and pretty flowers the norm. Early adopters of front yard vegetable gardens risked neighbour complaints about messy compost, pests and the potential for theft. 

“Fifteen years ago, it was sort of not acceptable to have a food garden in your front yard. They were something you put in the backyard, out of sight,” said Niki Jabbour, a Halifax gardening expert and author of 2020's Growing Under Cover. She said that changed as produce prices soared and people saw how beautiful food gardens can be. “It's a bit of a status symbol now to have a tidy vegetable garden in your front yard producing some of your own food.”

In Scarborough, Ont., Deonarly Songcuya has grown an astonishing variety in her front yard over seven years, including tomatillos, Thai basil, okra, kohlrabi, luffa (a tropical gourd), and sixty pepper varieties, five-alarmers like the Trinidad Scorpion and Carolina Reaper. With the harvest, the 38-year-old makes her own hot sauces, salsas, relishes, sauerkraut and kimchi. 

Raised in Manila, Ms. Songcuya remembers her mother growing vegetables on their rooftop, like many in the city did. During typhoon season, the garden fed them through power outages and store closures. 

“Now that I have my own garden, I started to reminisce on how and why my mom gardened,” Ms. Songcuya said. “Gardening, it gives me peace.”

She sees her children, 5 and 15, connecting to nature and learning about biodiversity and the value of farmers' work. Ms. Songcuya joked that this education extends to her husband, who thought tomatoes grow on trees. 

She loves giving curious passersby a tour of her green world: “I want to educate people that this is how much you can grow in your front yard.”

Michael Levenston was inspired in the 1970s watching Chinese grandmothers growing “fabulous,” highly productive vegetable gardens on every square inch of their properties in Vancouver's Chinatown. 

“That motivated us to say, a lot of food can be grown,” said Mr. Levenston, executive director of City Farmer Society, a Vancouver non-profit promoting urban agriculture since 1978. 

In cities, Canadians are growing food wherever they can find sun and space: front and back yards, yes, but also balconies, rooftops, boulevards, school properties, driveways and alleyways that have been de-paved, even traffic circles. For people living in food deserts, these unconventional gardens offer access to fresh produce. Sometimes, growing it yourself is the only way to get a hard-to-source vegetable for a family recipe.

In 2022, a million Canadian households planned to grow food for the first time, with 85 per cent of new gardeners living in cities, according to a survey from Dalhousie University and Angus Reid. 

The push follows great interest in food gardening since the arrival of COVID-19 and the panic buying and grocery store lineups that followed. Under lockdown, neighbours desperate for human contact migrated toward the street, sitting on their porches and gardening out front.

“For a long time, people have gone to their backyards for privacy: that's where all the living happened,” said Tara Nolan, whose book Gardening Your Front Yard was published one day before the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic. 

“More and more, people are doing more within their front yards,” said Ms. Nolan, who's been cultivating a vegetable garden in front of her home in Dundas, Ont. 

City Farmer Society's Mr. Levenston said people gravitate toward growing more of their own food in times of crisis and uncertainty. Through the First and Second World Wars, Canadians uprooted front yards, flower beds and vacant lots for “victory gardens,” which helped fill pantries during rationing and freed up transport for military shipments overseas. 

Today, some vegetable growers have the Trump administration's trade war, tariffs and deportations of migrant farm workers on their minds. 

Call it food sovereignty or self-sufficiency, gardeners like to rely on themselves. 

Since planting her front yard garden in Liverpool, N.S., in 2023, retired RCMP officer Sherry Williams estimates her grocery bills have been cut by half. 

Ms. Williams, 66, and her husband, Joe Young, 73, grow beans, peppers, cucumbers, corn and peaches, plus staples like potatoes, onions and garlic. Last year, they harvested 100 pounds of blueberries, canned 65 pounds of beets and 45 pounds of tomatoes. 

Between their gardening, her sewing quilts and her husband building guitars, they've been mentoring a neighbour in his twenties who grew interested in their teeming front yard project. 

“It catches one to another,” Ms. Williams said. “Not only are you eating real food, you're saving too.” 

A greenhouse built by Mr. Young extended their growing season from April to November, while a cold storage room keeps the harvest fresh for months.

“Costco, for us, is an hour and a half away,” she said. “We don't get produce there anymore.” 

Front yard gardens can involve an initial expense, Halifax author Ms. Jabbour cautioned: think seeds, soil, costly raised beds made of cedar, galvanized metal troughs. Eventually it pays off, especially for those growing hard-to-source heirloom varieties.

As front yard gardens grow more popular, many cities across Canada have established rules around the practice, including restrictions on gardening structures obstructing sight lines or drainage. Several Canadian cities, including Edmonton, Saskatoon, Victoria and most recently Ottawa and Thunder Bay, now allow vegetable growing in boulevards just beyond people's properties. Gardeners need to heed various rules around digging, raised beds, moveable containers, invasive species, height and setback requirements. 

“When you provide these sorts of opportunities, it's giving one more avenue for people to grow their own food,” said Rob Maclachlan, program manager in Ottawa's right-of-way branch. “It provides a great sense of community.”

Some use the extra land to grow heaps of produce to freeze and preserve over winter; others garden to give it away. 

Niki Jabbour notes a front yard vegetable garden can be expensive to kick off at first. “It's a bit of a status symbol now to have a tidy vegetable garden in your front yard producing some of your own food,” she says.Supplied

Toronto's Anjum Chagpar started vegetable gardening during the first summer of the pandemic because she was worried about supply chain disruptions. She soon discovered how therapeutic it is to run her hands through the soil. 

This spring she sowed beans and potatoes out front. Then she planted seedlings at the side of her house, which sits on a corner lot, beyond her fence on a narrow strip of land open to the street. Anything that grows there – beans, grape tomatoes – will be up for grabs. She'll put up signs that make clear people can help themselves. 

“I want to grow food that anyone is able to pick as they walk by, and also as an experiment to see if this idea seeds other ideas about sharing green spaces to share food,” said Ms. Chagpar, a 53-year-old systems designer working in climate action. 

Of course, some gardeners guard their treasures more closely. Ms. Chagpar recalled a large sign posted outside a front yard garden belonging to residents at a low-rise apartment near her home. The sign chastised vegetable thieves pilfering the garden. One resident was particularly distraught after a pepper he'd grown from seed was snatched. “It was for a special recipe,” Ms. Chagpar said.

In Gatineau, Ms. Cardarelli doesn't fret too much about theft from her highly visible garden.

“The only folks stealing seem to be some zealous skunks and raccoons taking bites and tossing,” she said. “I'd be happy if someone took vegetables. If that's what they need to make ends meet, I'd give it myself.”

The Ukrainian military said it hit the Borisoglebsk airfield, home to several Russian military aircraft. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has expressed frustration with Vladimir Putin. DW has more.

The Ukrainian military has said it struck a Russian military air base, claiming it hit a glide bomb store.

The attack comes after Ukraine said it recorded the largest number of drones launched by Russia on Friday.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said Ukraine would need more Patriot missiles after a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday.

These live updates have been closed. Thank you for reading.

Below, you can read a roundup of the developments regarding Russia's war in Ukraine from Saturday, July 5:

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned Russia's massive wave of drone strikes against Ukraine on Friday.

Guterres ""condemns the latest series of large-scale drone and missile attacks by the Russian Federation, reportedly the largest in over three years of war,"" a UN statement said.

""These strikes disrupted the power supply to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, once again underlining the ongoing risks to nuclear safety,"" he added, referring to Europe's largest nuclear power plant, which lies on the Dnieper river in southern Ukraine.

One person was killed and dozens injured on Friday.

""The Secretary-General is alarmed by this dangerous escalation and the growing number of civilian casualties. Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international law and must stop immediately,"" the statement said.

Guterres called for a ""full, immediate and unconditional ceasefire.""

The UK Defense Ministry's daily intelligence update said Russia had confirmed the death of Mikhail Gudkov, the deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy.

Gudkov was killed in a Ukrainian strike on March 28.

The update said Gudkov was the second senior Russian general to be killed this year, and the 16th since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022.

""The loss of so many high-ranking officers is likely to have had the effect of undermining command and control in parts of the Russian Armed Forces,"" the UK Defense Ministry said. ""This has likely contributed to Russian tactical and operational difficulties during the conflict.""

The Russian strikes on Friday came after a call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin after which the US President said he was ""very unhappy.""

Trump later held a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday evening, which appeared to have a more positive result.

Trump told reporters on Air Force One that the call with Zelenskyy had been good.

""We spoke about opportunities in air defense and agreed that we will work together to strengthen protection of our skies,"" Zelenskyy said on social media after the call.

Regarding his call with Putin, Trump hinted at the possibility of further US sanctions against Russia.

""We talk about sanctions a lot,"" Trump said. ""He understands that it may be coming.""

Trump said he would quickly end the war after coming into office, initially showing a closeness to Putin that marked a dramatic change from the previous White House administration.

However, Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration with Putin. Whether this will translate to more support for Ukraine remains to be seen.

The Ukrainian military said on Saturday that it had hit the Borisoglebsk airfield in the Voronezh region.

According to Kyiv, the base contained Russian Sukhoi Su-34, Su-35S and Su-30SM military jets. They said they hit a glide bomb depot and training aircraft, as well as other machines.

This could not be independently verified.

""The defense forces continue to take all measures to undermine the ability of the Russian occupiers to attack civilian infrastructure and to force the Russian Federation to cease its armed aggression against Ukraine,"" the armed forces said in a post on Telegram.

Voronezh Governor Aleksandr Gusev reported that there was damage but did not say what had been hit. The Defense Ministry said 94 Ukrainian drones were shot down, 34 of which were over the Voronezh region.

Ukraine also reported further Russian drone strikes on Saturday morning. Military Governor Oleh Synegubov posted on Telegram that at least three people, including a 12-year-old boy, had been injured in the city of Chuhuiv.

Ukraine on Saturday morning was still reeling from Russia's massive wave of strikes early on Friday, with the Ukrainian air force saying 550 drones had been fired on Ukraine, calling it the largest wave of strikes since the war began.

One person was killed and dozens more were injured in the attack.

Russia then launched another wave of attacks on Friday night.

The strikes came after a call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his counterpart Donald Trump who expressed dissatisfaction over the lack of progress.

US President Donald Trump signed a major disaster declaration. The severe flooding left dozens of people dead and several others missing — many from a girls' summer camp.

The death toll from flash floods in the US state of Texas rose to at least 67 people on Sunday as the search for girls missing from Camp Mystic summer camp continues.

Larry Leitha, the Kerr County Sheriff in Texas Hill Country, said the death toll in the hardest-hit Kerr County had reached 59, including the 21 children. 11 more girls and a camp counselor are unaccounted for.

At least 8 others died from the floods in other Texas counties. It is unclear how many in total are still missing.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday issued a major disaster declaration for Kerr County.

This is ""to ensure that our brave first responders immediately have the resources they need,"" Trump posted on social media.

Rescuers have been scouring the area to locate survivors, including 11 girls who have not been seen since the floods slammed into their camp, along the banks of the Guadalupe River.

Around 750 girls were attending Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp, in Kerr County, a rural area about 85 miles (140 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio.

US media reported that four of the missing girls were dead, citing their families.

Frantic parents and families posted photos of missing loved ones and pleas for information.

The obituary section of a local news site featured tributes to victims, including Camp Mystic's owner and director Dick Eastland.

The director of a nearby camp was also confirmed dead from the floods.

Officials said more than 850 people had been rescued in the last 36 hours.

However, many others had arrived in the area to celebrate United States Independence Day on Friday, so authorities say they don't know who else may be unaccounted for.

Texas Department of Emergency Management chief Nim Kidd said air, ground and water-based crews were scouring the length of the Guadalupe River for survivors and the bodies.

""We will continue the search until all those who are missing are found,"" he said.

Dalton Rice, an official from the city of Kerrville, said rescuers were facing ""very difficult"" conditions while ""looking in every possible location"" for survivors.

The extreme weather began before daybreak Friday — the start of the Fourth of July holiday weekend — as months' worth of rain fell in a matter of hours.

The fast-moving waters of the Guadalupe rose 26 feet (8 meters) in just 45 minutes, washing away homes and vehicles.

Camp Mystic was overwhelmed by floodwaters that inundated its riverside facilities. Buildings were destroyed and the highway to the camp was washed away, hindering rescue efforts.

Several other communities along the Guadalupe were hit hard, with buildings, bridges and roads washed out.

Afterward, the National Weather Service said the flash flood had dumped more than a foot of rain, half of the total the region sees in a typical year.

Officials and residents alike were shocked by the speed and intensity of the rising waters.

The area along the Guadalupe River has long been vulnerable to flooding, sparking questions about the lack of proper warnings.

The National Weather Service (NWS) had issued flood alerts, but US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the warnings had not accurately predicted the extreme rainfall.

Noem said the Trump administration was working to upgrade the early warning system, although the NWS's parent agency has recently faced huge cuts, leaving many weather offices understaffed.

US Rep. Chip Roy, whose district includes the ravaged area, called it a once-in-a-century flood and acknowledged that there would be finger-pointing.

The county had considered a river flood warning system similar to a tornado warning over the past decade, but officials say the cost was then deemed too high.

Musk's new party might focus on picking up House and Senate seats in the midterm elections next year. He is not the first person trying to break the United States' two-party system.

Multibillionaire tech CEO Elon Musk says he has launched a new US political party called the America Party.

""When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy. Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom,"" he posted on X, the social media platform he owns, on Saturday. 

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO floated the idea of forming a new political party after a public and bitter falling-out with President Donald Trump.

Musk spent hundreds of millions of dollars to support Trump's re-election and led the so-called Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE in the Trump administration, which aimed to cut government spending, before their disagreements spilled into the open. 

He revived the idea of a new political party this week as US lawmakers approved Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill.

Musk was among the legislation's most vocal critics and has pledged to establish a new party to oppose Republicans who supported the bill.

On Friday, he posted a poll asking whether users ""want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system,"" drawing over 1.2 million responses, with more than 60% in favor of a new party.

A truly competitive third party could disrupt over a century of Democratic and Republican dominance at all levels of government.

But Musk would not be the first person trying to establish a party to challenge their dominance. 

Former President Theodore Roosevelt came the closest in 1912, after splitting from the Republican party. He ran as Progressive Party candidate and won 27% of the popular vote and 88 electoral votes. 

More recently, Ross Perot, another billionaire, won 19% of the popular vote but no electoral votes in the 1992 presidential campaign as an independent and later formed the Reform Party. 

Musk has already indicated that he is not aiming for an all-out win. Instead, his America Party would focus on flipping a couple of House and Senate seats by applying, ""extremely concentrated force at a precise location on the battlefield.""

He believes that by targeting key races, the America Party could hold decisive votes on contentious legislation.

A massive campaign war chest could give Musk an edge. 

Parties spend billions of dollars to get their candidates elected. According to donations watchdog OpenSecrets, nearly $16 billion (about €13.58 billion) was spent across the 2024 presidential and congressional races.

Musk himself was the biggest donor in the 2023-24 election cycle. He gave more than $291 million to Republicans across all races.

However, money is not the only factor that matters.

In April, Musk has provided million-dollar checks to some voters in Wisconsin ahead of an election for the state's Supreme Court.

Voters chose Democratic-backed Susan Crawford, who defeated conservative Brad Schimel for a State Supreme Court seat, despite $25 million in spending from Musk.

Forest protectors are defending mature forests from logging after dam removal and restoration on the Elwha River.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

Standing at the edge of the Aldwell Forest clearcut just above the Elwha River in Washington State, the Murphy Company's devastation of the landscape slaps you in the face. Here on land owned by the state's Department of Natural Resources (DNR), a beautiful mature forest has been logged for hardwood, plywood, and other wood products. Hacked-off stumps are visible in all directions, a few trees left to stand. The former forest floor, once rich with organisms and nutrients that fed life, now stands heaped into huge slash piles to be burned. The land doused with herbicide to kill any competitors to Douglas fir seedlings that will become a new tree plantation monoculture.

The contrast with the remaining intact Elwha legacy forests, located nearby in the watershed, couldn't be starker. There, in naturally regenerated forests more than a century old, large Douglas fir, western red cedar and big-leaf maple trees festooned with moss and licorice ferns surround you. Native sword ferns, trillium, salal, red huckleberry, lichen, and other native vegetation in multiple shades of brilliant green abound.

After DNR put more Elwha legacy forest on the chopping block during a November 2024 auction, environmentalists, citizens, and forest defenders are fighting to stop Murphy's logging there through lawsuits and direct action.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

For over a month, a tree-sit launched by a grouping called the Olympic Forest Defenders (OFD) blocked the road into the Parched forest site scheduled for destruction. The sit received broad support through encampments, rallies, and continuous supply efforts from community members. After a judge refused to extend an injunction against logging, police and violent vigilantes attacked the sit and encampment. The OFD made a decision to end the tree-sit on June 15 for the safety of those involved.

“Our commitment to defend the forests and waters of the Olympic Peninsula remains strong,” states an OFD press release. “To the vigilantes, the DNR cops, and state-sponsored repression, we say: You did not dig up our roots. We are still here. Stop pillaging our people. Stop pillaging our forests. Stop pillaging our waters. Our movement has not been uprooted. It is just beginning to grow.”

The Elwha River runs out of the protected Olympic National Park. It is the pulsing heart of the ancestral homelands of the Lower Elwha Klallam tribe. Two large hydropower dams, the Elwha and Glines Canyon, were built on the river between 1910 and 1927 to fuel timber processing and industry in the Port Angeles area. The dam builder didn't bother to include legally required mechanisms for fish passage.

The dams blocked the free-flowing river, flooding tribal village and cultural sites and decimating the tribe's way of life. Ninety-three percent of the upstream salmon spawning habitat was cut off, leading to near extirpation of pristine populations of wild salmon in the river that was central to the Lower Elwha people's life and culture. Before the dams, the Elwha was famous for its enormous chinook salmon, precious to the tribe and a primary food source for orca whales of the Salish Sea.

Tribal elders passed down to their children and grandchildren the stories of the river filled with fish before the dams. Under tribal pressure that spanned generations, a $325 million project was launched in 2011 by tribal, governmental, and academic agencies and scientists to restore the river ecosystem by removing the dams; restoring the river's flow; planting native plants; and building back the populations of five species of Pacific salmon, steelhead, and other species. The dams were finally taken down in the years between 2011 and 2014 — more than 20 years after a 1992 Congressional Act ordered it.

The project has been an inspiring success in restoring the anadromous fish populations and the ecosystem, as well as a source of pride for the Lower Elwha people. The river returned to natural channels after dam removal, and after a few years of major sediment release, it began to clear. The released sediment rebuilt the delta and estuary at the Elwha mouth on the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which is critical to rearing juvenile migrating fish.

But new logging of forests on the hills just above the river represents an assault on the restoration efforts that have been achieved. It also explains the deep feelings held among tribal members, Forest Defenders, conservationists, and others who care about the land and river ecosystem.

A petition circulated in October 2024 by Lower Elwha tribe members and signed by over half of the members of the tribe, as well as 2,500 other people, states that,

We do not understand a way of thinking that would spend hundreds of millions on Elwha River restoration but continue to industrially log in that same watershed. We do not understand a way of thinking that takes too much and says it is never enough; that would disrespect a River that gives us so much life and now hope.

Our ancestral knowledge and sacred obligation to the natural world teaches us a different path. We have inherent and treaty protected rights in these lands as our usual and accustomed gathering areas. Together, we call for the protection of the Elwha Watershed as a commitment to our mutual future and to the wellbeing of all who depend upon it. We ask you to stop these planned timber sales and heed our call to be guided by principles of respect and reciprocity in caring for the watershed.

The DNR's November 2024 auction of the now-threatened Elwha forests to the Murphy Company were among others the DNR Board of Resources rushed through in apparent anticipation of new Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove taking office in January 2025. Upthegrove had pledged to protect legacy forests if elected.

The Tree Well and Parched logging plans threaten to cut over 300 acres of mature legacy conifer forest, some of which has never been logged. Two lawsuits were filed to overturn the sales in December 2024 by the Earth Law Center (ELC) in conjunction with the Orca Network, the Center for Whale Research, and the Legacy Forest Defense Coalition (LFDC).

The lawsuits lay out a coherent, detailed picture of the damage new logging would cause to the river ecosystem. The ELC suit alleges that the DNR is violating the state Public Lands and Environmental Policy Acts by failing to perform an adequate environmental assessment of the logging's impact on mature, structurally complex, and biodiverse forests. The two forest sites are critical to carbon sequestration and as habitat for wildlife and culturally significant native plants.

The lawsuit also argues scientific studies have shown logging negatively impacts stream flows, hydrology, and water temperature — all factors critical to supporting the Elwha system and its salmon populations, which in turn support populations of the critically endangered southern resident orcas.

The groups' also charge that logging on steep slopes in these sites above the Elwha and its tributaries threatens slope stability, pointing out the potential impact to Port Angeles's water supply.

LFCD is suing for injunctive relief against the sale of the forests on the basis that the DNR is neglecting to follow its own policies to regenerate old-growth forest on 10-15 percent of state forestlands — a legal approach that has successfully paused other DNR timber sales.

The LFDC's Kyle Krakow told Truthout in an emailed statement that the group has “appealed a total of 32 sales in lawsuits that are still ongoing in most cases. Collectively, these timber sales threaten over 2,300 acres of biodiverse and carbon-dense legacy forests across western Washington.”

Truthout also spoke to LaTrisha Suggs, a restoration planner for, and enrolled member of, the Jamestown S'Klallam tribe. Her family has lived for time immemorial in Clallam County. Suggs is also a Port Angeles City Council member who worked as a restoration planner for the Lower Elwha tribe on the river restoration project.

In a declaration filed in support of the LFDC lawsuit, Suggs stated that,

The sites of many of the proposed and sold parcels have steep slopes, and the levels of logging that occurs has an impact on the potential for landslides, particularly with the impacts of climate change and increased rain events in Port Angeles. When landslides occur, because the trees can no longer hold back the soil due to clear cutting, the soil runs into the streams and rivers, blocking access to salmon and impacting water quality. The soils of mature forests act as storage for water that the plant communities rely on during the summer months.

Her declaration also stated that Port Angeles has been under a stage three water shortage each summer since 2022, and Clallam County has been under a drought advisory for years — issues expected to get worse as climate change advances.

Elizabeth Dunne is ELC's director of legal advocacy. She lives near the Elwha River and co-founded the Elwha Legacy Forest Coalition (ELF) after DNR sanctioned logging on the Aldwell forest. Dunne and the coalition's successful efforts to stop a prior timber sale in the Elwha has been told in an award-winning short film, Last Stand, Saving the Elwha River's Legacy Forests.

She shared a map with Truthout showing that greater than 50 percent of the Elwha's legacy forests have been logged in just the last 17 years; little older forest remains in the Elwha watershed. Now DNR has plans for logging 800 more acres.

“The Elwha River is really speaking for many of these ecosystems that are suffering at the hands of over-extraction and exploitation for profit without having any kind of sense of responsibility of the balance that we need to show back to the Earth if we are going to continue to survive as a species. And not just survive but be able to thrive,” Dunne said. “Imagine a world where we can go fishing, where we have abundant ecosystems, and they're not all controlled and commodified, and we're able to, sustain ourselves.”

In early May, Murphy began building roads into the Parched timber units, tearing down trees and bringing in gravel. In response, on May 7 the Olympic Forest Defenders began their tree-sit, blocking the road into the Parched site off U.S. Highway 101.

The Forest Defenders demanded an immediate cancellation of the Parched timber sale, a pause on all logging in the Elwha watershed, and a permanent ban on logging the remaining mature forests in western Washington.

The tree-sit involved a cable pulley stretched from logs and other debris blocking the middle of the logging road connected to a “dunk tank”-type platform 60-80 feet up a nearby large grand fir tree. Cutting the cable would cause the sitter on the platform to come crashing down.

Truthout was able to visit and speak there and on the phone with “Fable,” a 25-year-old tree-sitter, about the goals of the tree-sit and why they were participating. “There's a long history in the Pacific Northwest of direct action and tree-sitting being effective, especially when done in conjunction with some sort of legal pressure,” Fable told Truthout.

They told Truthout they had grown up a timber farm and helped manage it with their parents. The family would talk about the impact of logging on the land and the creeks, and Fable would go salmon fishing with their dad and uncles, learning about the connection between forests, rivers, and salmon.

Fable told Truthout that they had studied math to get a master's degree, but their recent experience of caretaking for a loved one who was sick changed their life. The experience “made me want to be more involved in things that actually make change in the world,” they said. “Realistically, the most good you can do is caring for people and caring for land, and keeping people and land safe from the really evil things that are out there.”

Rallies were held at the Parched site, and for over a month community members from around the region continuously brought in supplies and camped to protect the sitter. DNR officers initially surrounded the tree, running generator-powered lights around the clock before backing off. They would at times try to stop people from going in or threaten them with arrest.

“The support's been great and kind of surprising,” Fable said. “People understand how critical of a moment this is and that this kind of action is necessary, which really gives me a lot of hope because that's how I feel. And to not just be a lone person doing something like this is just really, really cool.”

After the tree-sit began, Land Commissioner Upthegrove, who placed a six-month pause on logging legacy forests, condemned the sitters saying, “This stunt is dangerous, reckless and counterproductive…. Their actions put the safety and lives of my employees at risk, and I will seek the prosecution of those involved to the fullest extent of the law. This kind of dangerous vandalism makes it harder to advance a positive environmental agenda.”

The sitters' message, on the other hand, was: “Dave Upthegrove promised to protect mature forests. We are here helping him keep his promise.”

Upthegrove's threats ignited phone calls and emails to his office, including from some who had worked for him because of his campaign pledges. Nonetheless on May 28, he doubled down on threats to the Forest Defenders, saying, “We intend to hold those responsible accountable.”

A statement on DNR's website says Upthegrove is reassessing the process on legacy forests, but that, “Some paused sales could be reconfigured and brought forward to auction once the criteria to exclude structurally complex forests that are critical to carbon storage and habitat biodiversity are developed.” Upthegrove also said he's committed to protect sales approved before he took office, saying, “It's important to defend policies and the authority of the agency.”

It's unclear what DNR will do after the six-month “pause” in legacy forest sales ends. In a letter to Clallam County Democrats, Upthegrove said he intended to bring forward a policy to protect 77,000 acres of older forests, a significant step if done, though less than the 106,000 acres of legacy forest currently unprotected. He claimed, without evidence, that the tree-sit had endangered DNR employees.

After first ordering a two-week injunction against logging and compelling DNR to produce administrative records supporting its decision to approve the timber sales, a Clallam County Superior Court judge refused to extend the injunction past May 23. On June 6, she ruled against an LFDC filing which sought to prevent logging until both lawsuits could receive a full hearing on their merits. Hearings on the merits should be held in coming months.

Dunne told Truthout that she was disappointed in the judge's ruling. “Existing policies aside, what we need today is action commensurate with the gravity of the extinction and biodiversity crisis: a clear directive creating an Ecological Forest Reserve and permanently protecting all remaining legacy forests on state lands for their intrinsic value and as essential to the survival of all species,” she said.

On June 13, police of unknown affiliation swept the camp, seizing supplies and hindering the ability of the encampment to protect the tree-sitter's life. (A DNR spokesperson told Truthout he couldn't comment on the raid of the encampment or the vigilante attacks, only saying DNR had “cleared the many makeshift barricades” on the logging road.) Despite this, the community rallied in support, bringing new supplies and people to keep the sit protected.

Over the next days, violent vigilantes attacked the tree-sit twice. They tampered with the cable and tripod anchoring the platform supporting the tree-sitter, causing it to dangerously dip. Vigilantes also drunkenly threatened to kill the Forest Defenders and threw bottles around. One pointed a gun at Forest Defenders, walking aggressively toward them and then shot into the forest. After this, the Defenders decided to safely evacuate the site before someone was hurt or killed.

At press time, the tree-sit and encampment are gone but the outcome with the threatened forests remains undetermined. Those protecting the forests remain committed to their aims and lawsuits on the merits of the logging remain to be heard.

“Dave Upthegrove ran as a progressive, and that's kind of the first and main legislator we're pushing back against right now. I don't know that we would have done things any different if there weren't these sort of executive orders (like Trump's on timber sales) going into place, and this sort of over-escalation and fascism in our country … and is giving people hope that even under a really threatening administration, we can keep pushing back against it,” Fable told Truthout.

No matter the strategy, the goal is the same: avoid potential federal audits, funding cuts, and closures.

This story was published in partnership between The 19th and The 74, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news site covering education in America. It was originally reported by Jo Napolitano of The 74. Meet Jo and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.

Schools and other organizations serving undocumented students are taking their activities underground, fearful of revealing all they do to help newcomers navigate life in America — lest they be targeted and shuttered by the Trump administration.

Some have asked staff to use secure messaging systems like Signal instead of text and email to keep sensitive conversations from public reach. Others say such discussions should happen only over the phone. 

A few are reconsidering the distribution of once-standard know-your-rights cards, afraid they could overstep some unclear federal boundary about immigration enforcement, while others are scrubbing the names and locations of their sites from the internet. 

No matter the strategy, the goal is the same: avoid federal audits, funding cuts and closures that could be prompted by their work with undocumented students and families, but also the administration's edict against diversity, equity and inclusion.

“Because of the threats from the federal administration about revoking the 501(c)(3) status of nonprofits, we want to keep ourselves from being targeted,” said one man who asked not to be identified because he works for an organization that serves undocumented youth. 

Groups like his can lose their IRS status, which allows them to collect tax-deductible donations, if they engage in political activities. For this reason, he said, they are carefully policing staff members' speech in public and in private. Political discussions or commentary on social media are forbidden. 

“Anything that could be perceived as obstructing or challenging federal immigration policies, we don't put in writing,” he said. “Anything that could be seen as a criticism of the administration — or anything that could be seen as partisan — we're going to completely avoid.”

An administrator for a small Illinois school district that serves mostly Hispanic children said that while it still provides help to all families — including connecting them to rental and tax-preparation assistance — staff are more guarded about publicizing their efforts. Any high-profile association between the school and these types of services can be a flag to their families' immigration status. 

“We're not trying to draw attention,” she said, asking that she not be identified in order to protect her students. “I don't want any light shining on our district.”

Her fears around immigration were heightened in February, she said, when she received two letters addressed to her office from the Department of Homeland Security, asking for the whereabouts of two children. 

“I ignored them,” she said. “I just pretended like it didn't happen. I did not respond in terms of providing the information and so far, nobody has followed up.”

Those early efforts took place just weeks after President Donald Trump returned to office and are among the administration's first known attempts to target and locate undocumented children. Reports of federal agents undertaking welfare checks on young immigrants who crossed the border unaccompanied did not surface until months later. 

Some of those visits have led to their parents being detained and, in some cases, arrested. Hundreds of kids, their caretakers hauled away, have been placed in government custody in recent months. 

Many schools, including the one in Illinois, are curbing the use of words like “diversity” and “equity,” in all their communications. They're worried they could be accused of obstructing the law: Trump has likened the use of these terms — “inclusion” among them — to a type of indoctrination he will stamp out by withholding the offending group's funding. These schools and advocacy organizations are also barring staff from participating in protests or rallies related to immigration — or student detainment. 

And they said school-sponsored events, like a normally well-attended spring family night for the parents of English learners, have been nearly empty — or worse, cancelled — since Trump took office and immigrants avoid large gatherings. 

Catherine Lhamon, executive director of The Edley Center on Law & Democracy at the University of California, Berkeley, argued that now is not the time to retreat. Lhamon, the head of the Education Department's civil rights division during both the Obama and Biden administrations, said efforts to avoid Trump's dragnet have proven futile. 

“The impulse to keep your head down and hope that you will escape notice has been demonstrably ineffective during the first months of the Trump administration,” she said. “Fulfilling your mission, doing the things that took you to this work, standing for your principles, that's what each of us should do.”

Lhamon said, too, that discouraging staff from speaking out publicly in defense of their students erodes the bond between the two. 

“It also strikes at the core component of schooling, that is to teach people how to think critically, how to question authority,” she said. “That is the function of schooling. Curtailing that is a mistake.”

And while Trump has threatened Harvard University with the loss of its 501(c)(3) status, the Nonprofit Alliance notes his powers are limited, though House Republicans are seeking their expansion. 

Whether Trump's threats are idle or actual, their impact has changed how immigrant-focused entities operate. 

Barbara Marler, a long-time educator-turned-consultant in Illinois, has worked with newcomer students for decades. She's now offering school districts and other education-focused clients the option of combing through their records to find and erase any DEI-related terms an AI bot could flag as troublesome. 

Such wording could trigger Freedom of Information requests that Marler described as “nefarious” and one school administrator, already inundated by them, deemed harassment.

“Never, in my career of over 40 years, have I felt the need to do this,” said Marler, adding that a majority of school districts in vocal, right-leaning communities feel compelled to adopt these precautions. “They want to do right by their [English learners], but are worried that legal challenges would bankrupt them in the worst-case scenario — or board meeting harassment would be triggered in the best-case scenario.”

Alejandra Vázquez Baur, a fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and director of the National Newcomer Network, notes most of the people who work for organizations that serve immigrants want to draw attention to children and families who've historically been cast aside.

“We know exactly what it feels like to feel ostracized by a system that was not built for us,” she said. “We come into this work to amend that. And so the reality of the situation at this moment is heartbreaking. We do not join these fields to mince our words and hide our intentions.”

Some groups, including those that operate inside immigrant-friendly states or cities, with big budgets and robust legal defense, might feel emboldened to push back, she said. But small organizations, particularly those run by immigrants, who might themselves be undocumented or whose staff have mixed status, can't afford that risk. 

Trump himself was forced to close his own 501(c)(3), a private foundation established in 1987, as part of a 2018 settlement after his family was found to have used money earmarked for charity to further the president's political campaign. Trump, who was ordered to pay $2 million in damages, called the investigation “harassment.” 

Antero Godina Garcia, professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Education, said even a public retreat in name only by those groups that serve immigrants marks a loss for the community. He worries that it will shrink these organizations' reach and the families they assist will have fewer places where their identities are recognized and affirmed.

“It is not just less services and opportunities for these communities, but also a broader erosion of how individuals can see themselves as valued within the social fabric of this country,” he said. 

But the man who works for the organization serving undocumented youth, who voiced concern about preserving its tax-exempt status, said it's difficult to determine what types of comments or activities are considered over the line by the Trump administration. 

“It gets complicated because things that we think are normal and are legal, such as offering know-your-rights training, the administration could easily perceive that as obstructing their policies, making them hostile to us,” he said. 

As for the written footprint, Marler, who has attended numerous conferences on how best to serve multilingual learners, has observed a telling shift in the types of in-class translating applications marketed to teachers. These tools were long promoted for their ability to keep records, allowing educators to go back and examine communications over time to learn more about students and families. 

Now, Marler said, those same companies are marketing privacy. 

“One of their top-selling points was there was no record of the material that was translated,” she said — so communications couldn't be subpoenaed or subjected to public records requests. “Now, that is their sales point.”

AI in schools isn't progress — it's a sign of how far we've strayed from the purpose of education.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

In April, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon stood onstage at a major ed-tech conference in San Diego and declared with conviction that students across the U.S. would soon benefit from “A1 teaching.” She repeated it over and over — “A1” instead of “AI.” “There was a school system that's going to start making sure that first graders, or even pre-Ks, have A1 teaching every year. That's a wonderful thing!” she assured the crowd.

The moment quickly went viral. Late-night hosts roasted her. A.1. Steak Sauce posted a mock advertisement: “You heard her. Every school should have access to A.1.”

Funny — until it wasn't. Because behind the gaffe was something far more disturbing: The person leading federal education policy wants to replace the emotional and intellectual process of teaching and learning with a mechanical process of content delivery, data extraction, and surveillance masquerading as education.

This is part of a broader agenda being championed by billionaires like Bill Gates. “The A.I.s will get to that ability, to be as good a tutor as any human ever could,” Gates said at a recent conference for investors in educational technology. As one headline bluntly summarized: “Bill Gates says AI will replace doctors, teachers within 10 years.”

This isn't just a forecast, it's a libidinal fantasy — a capitalist dream of replacing relationships with code and scalable software, while public institutions are gutted in the name of “innovation.”

We need to stop pretending that algorithms can think — and we should stop believing that software is intelligent. While using the term “AI” will be necessary to be understood at times, we should begin to introduce and use more accurate language.

And no, I'm not suggesting we start calling it “A1”— unless we're talking about how it's being slathered on everything whether we asked for it or not. What we're calling AI is better understood as Artificial Mimicry: a reflection without thought, articulation without a soul.

Philosopher Raphaël Millière explains that what these systems are doing is not thinking or understanding, but using what he calls “algorithmic mimicry”: sophisticated pattern-matching that mimics human outputs without possessing human cognition. He writes that large pre-trained models like ChatGPT or DALL-E 2 are more like “stochastic chameleons” — not merely parroting back memorized phrases, but blending into the style, tone, and logic of a given prompt with uncanny fluidity. That adaptability is impressive — and can be dangerous — precisely because it can so easily be mistaken for understanding.

So-called AI can be useful in certain contexts. But what we're calling AI in schools today doesn't think, doesn't reason, doesn't understand. It guesses. It copies. It manipulates syntax and patterns based on probability, not meaning. It doesn't teach — it prompts. It doesn't mentor — it manages.

In short, it mimics intelligence. But mimicry is not wisdom. It is not care. It is not pedagogy.

Real learning, as the renowned psychologist Lev Vygotsky showed, is a social process. It happens through dialogue, relationships, and shared meaning-making. Learning unfolds in what Vygotsky called the Zone of Proximal Development — that space between what a learner can do alone and what they can achieve with the guidance of a more experienced teacher, peer, or mentor — someone who can respond with care, ask the right question, and scaffold the next step.

AI can't do that.

It can't sense when a student's silence means confusion or when it means trauma. It can't notice a spark in a student's eyes when they connect a concept to their lived experience. It can't see the brilliance behind a messy, not fully developed idea, or the potential in an unconventional voice. It cannot build a beloved community.

Education entrepreneurs are touting artificial intelligence as the cure for everything from unequal tutoring access to teacher burnout.

It can generate facts, follow-up with questions, offer corrections, give summaries, or suggest next steps — but it can't recognize the emotional weight of confusion or the quiet excitement of an intellectual breakthrough.

That work — the real work of teaching and learning — cannot be automated.

AI tools like Magic School, Perplexity, and School.ai do offer convenience: grammar fixes, sentence rewording, tone improvements. But they also push students toward formulaic, high-scoring answers. AI nudges students toward efficient compliance, not intellectual risk; such tools teach conformity, not originality.

Recently, my son used MagicSchool's AI chatbot, Raina, during one of his sixth grade classes to research his project on Puerto Rico. The appeal was obvious — instant answers, no need to sift through dense texts or multiple websites. But Raina never asked the deeper questions: Why does a nation that calls itself the “land of the free” still hold Puerto Rico as a colony? How do AI systems like itself contribute to the climate crisis that is threatening the future of the island? Raina delivered tidy answers. But raising more complicated questions — and helping students wrestle with the emotional weight of the answers — is the work of a human teacher.

AI can help simplify texts or support writing, but it can also miseducate. Over time, it trains students to mimic what the algorithm deems “effective,” rather than develop their own voice or ideas. Reading becomes extraction, not connection. The soul of literature is lost when reading becomes a mechanical task, not an exchange of ideas and emotions between human beings.

Many teachers, underpaid and overwhelmed, turn to AI out of necessity.

But we have to ask: Why, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, are class sizes so large — and resources so scarce — that teachers are forced to rely on AI instead of instructional assistants? Why aren't we hiring more librarians to curate leveled texts or reducing class sizes so teachers can tailor learning themselves?

AI doesn't just flatten learning — it now can monitor students' digital behavior in deeply invasive ways. Marketed as safety tools, these systems track what students write, search, or post, even on school-issued devices taken home — extending surveillance into students' personal lives. Instead of funding counselors, schools spend thousands (like a New Jersey district's $58,000) on surveillance software. In Vancouver, Washington, a data breach exposed how much personal information, including mental health and LGBTQ+ identities, was quietly harvested. One study found almost 60 percent of U.S. students censor themselves when monitored. As Encode Justice leaders Shreya Sampath and Marisa Syed put it, students care that their “data is collected and commodified,” and that their peers “censor themselves in learning environments meant to encourage exploration.”

Ursula Wolfe-Rocca, a teacher at a low-income school in Portland, Oregon, described the current use of AI as “ad hoc,” with some teachers at her school experimenting with it and others not using it at all. While her school is still developing an official policy, she voiced concern about the AI enthusiasm among some staff and administrators, driven by “unsubstantiated hype about how AI can help close the equity gap.”

Wolfe-Rocca's description reflects a national pattern: AI use in schools is uneven and largely unregulated, yet districts are increasingly promoting its adoption. Even without a clear policy framework, the message many educators receive is that AI is coming, and they are expected to embrace it. Yet this push often comes without serious discussion of pedagogy, ethics, or the structural inequities AI may actually deepen — especially in underresourced schools like hers.

In today's AI gold rush, education entrepreneurs are trading in old scripts of standardization for sleek promises of personalization — touting artificial intelligence as the cure for everything from unequal tutoring access to teacher burnout. Take Salman Khan, founder of Khan Academy, who speaks in lofty terms about AI's potential. Khan recently created the Khanmigo chatbot tutor and described it as a way to “democratize student access to individualized tutoring,” claiming it could eventually give “every student in the United States, and eventually on the planet, a world-class personal tutor.” Khan's new book, Brave New Words, reads like a swooning love letter to AI — an emotionless machine that, fittingly, will never love him back. It's hard to ignore the irony of Khan titling his book Brave New Words — an echo of Huxley's dystopian novel Brave New World where individuality is erased, education is mechanized, and conformity is maintained through technological ease. But rather than treat Huxley's vision as a warning, Khan seems to take it as a blueprint, and his book reads like a case study in missing the point.

In one example, Khan praises Khanmigo's ability to generate a full World War II unit plan — complete with objectives and a multiple-choice classroom poll.

Students are asked to select the “most significant cause” of the war:

But the hard truths are nowhere to be found. Khanmigo, for example, doesn't prompt students to wrestle with the fact that Hitler openly praised the United States for its Jim Crow segregation laws, eugenics programs, and its genocide against Native Americans.

Like so many snake oil education “cures” before it, Khan has pulled up to the schoolhouse door with a wagon full of digital elixirs. It's classic EdTech hucksterism: a flashy pitch, sweeping claims about revolutionizing education, and recycled behaviorist ideas dressed up as innovation. Behaviorism — a theory that reduces learning to observable changes in behavior in response to external stimuli — treats students less as thinkers and more as programmable responders. Khan's vision of AI chatbots replacing human tutors isn't democratizing; it's dehumanizing.

“What we need isn't more AI — it's more teachers, support staff, and real training, especially after COVID left so many educators underprepared.”

Far from exciting or new, these automated “solutions” follow a long tradition of behaviorist teaching technologies. As historian Audrey Watters documents in Teaching Machines, efforts to personalize learning through automation began in the 1920s and gained traction with B.F. Skinner's teaching machines in the 1950s. But these tools often failed, built on the flawed assumption that learning is just programmed response rather than human connection.

Despite these failures, today's tech elites are doubling down. But let's be clear: this isn't the kind of education they want for their own children. The wealthy get small classes, music teachers, rich libraries, arts and debate programs, and human mentors. Our kids are offered AI bots in overcrowded classrooms. It's a familiar pattern — standardized, scripted learning for the many; creativity and care for the few. Elites claim AI will “level the playing field,” but they offload its environmental costs onto the public. Training large AI models consumes enormous amounts energy and water and fuels the climate crisis. The same billionaires pushing AI build private compounds to shield their children from the damage their industries cause — instead of regulating tech or cutting emissions, they protect their own from both the pedagogy and the fallout of their greed.

Em Winokur is an Oregon school librarian who joined the Multnomah Education Service District's “AI Innovators” cohort to offer a critical voice in a conversation dominated by hype and industry influence. She has seen the contradictions firsthand. “EdTech companies aren't invested in our students' growth or in building a more caring world,” Winokur told Truthout. “What we need isn't more AI — it's more teachers, support staff, and real training, especially after COVID left so many educators underprepared.”

Of course, hedge fund managers, CEOs, and the politicians they bankroll will scoff at this vision. They'll call it impractical, unaffordable, unrealistic. They'll argue that the economy can't support more educators, or school psychologists, smaller classes, or fully staffed school libraries. And then, without missing a beat, they'll offer AI as the solution: cheaper, faster, easier. Theirs is a vision for hollowed-out, mechanized imitation of education.

Many educators and students aren't passively accepting this AI-driven future. Youth-led groups like Encode Justice are at the forefront of the struggle to regulate AI. The Algorithmic Justice League is challenging the spread of biometric surveillance in schools, warning that facial recognition systems threaten student safety and school climate. Organizing efforts like Black Lives Matter at School and the Teach Truth movement are part of a growing refusal to let billionaires dictate the terms of learning.

AI in schools isn't progress — it's a sign of much deeper underlying problems with U.S. schooling that reveal how far we've strayed from the purpose of education. For decades, policy makers and profiteers have swapped human care for high-stakes testing, scripted curriculum, and surveillance. AI isn't the disease — it's a symptom of a colonizer's model of schooling that is extractive and dehumanizing, rather than liberating. That means regulating AI isn't enough — we must dismantle the logic that brought it in.

I once had a student — I'll call him Marcus — who was a high school senior already accepted into a good college. But late in the year, his grades dropped sharply, and he was suddenly at risk of not graduating. Over time, Marcus and I built trust — especially through lessons on Black history and resistance to racism. As a Black student who had long been denied this history, he came to see that I wasn't there to grade him, rank him, or punish him, but to fight injustice. That connection helped him open up and share with me that he was unhoused. Once I understood what he was facing, I connected him with support services and worked with his other teachers to be flexible and compassionate. He ended up passing his classes, graduating, and going on to college.

That kind of care doesn't come from code. It comes from a human relationship — one rooted in trust, justice, and love.

            The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is now Germany's largest opposition group and even topped several opinion polls – briefly putting it ahead of now-Chancellor Friedrich Merz's center-right party – in the weeks after February's federal election.
    


            At the same time, the AfD is facing growing calls for an outright ban, most recently from another major political party.
    


            In May, the country's domestic intelligence agency formally classified the AfD as an extremist entity that threatens democracy. In a 1,100-page report, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, or BfV, also laid out its findings that the party was racist, anti-Muslim, and devaluing of “entire segments” of Germany's population.
    


            That  move, which enables the BfV to better monitor the group , has reignited attempts to impose a ban, despite the party claiming a significant 20.8% of the vote in February's national election – the best performance by a far-right party in the country since World War II.
    


            The AfD has also enjoyed very vocal support from the Trump administration, with Tesla billionaire Elon Musk – who has since left his position in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) – urging Germans to vote for the party in the run-up to the election. More recently, both US Vice President, JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have criticized Germany's decision to classify the AfD as extremist.
    


            On Monday, the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), which is currently serving as the junior coalition partner in Berlin's conservative-led government, voted unanimously to begin efforts to outlaw it.
    


            Yet the legal path to banning the AfD is lengthy – and largely unprecedented.
    


            Set up to avoid a repeat of Nazi rule, Germany's political system operates on the basis of streitbare Demokratie, or “militant democracy,” meaning it is a democracy “determined and able to defend itself.”
    


            In other words, the German state can actively defend itself against internal threats to its democratic principles and constitutional order, including through the banning of political parties.
    


            However, two criteria must be met by Germany's Federal Constitutional Court to form a legal basis for a ban.
    


            Firstly, the party in question must be found to work against the country's free democratic order, demonstrating an “actively belligerent, aggressive stance.” Secondly, the party must be popular enough to pose a tangible threat to democracy, a provision created in 2017 and called “potentiality.”
    


            Parties found to meet the first criterion, but not the second, can be prohibited from accessing public campaign financing, but are allowed to continue with other activities.
    


            “It is a widespread misconception in Germany that the AfD cannot be banned because… it is too large,” Till Holterhus, professor of Constitutional Law at the Leuphana University of Lüneberg, told CNN.
    


            “The opposite is true: its size demonstrates that it fulfills the criterion of ‘potentiality.'”
    


            To begin the process of banning a party, a formal request must be made to the federal court. This request can only be made by either the government itself, the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, or the Bundesrat, the legislative body that represents the country's 16 regional states.
    


            The court then decides whether to begin proceedings or throw out the application as unsubstantiated.
    


            It must hold a full trial, examining thousands of pages of evidence and hearing witnesses, and considers whether the party violates the constitution in practice, Holterhus explained.
    


            The court can then declare a party unconstitutional. The party would then be  dissolved and banned from all political activity. It would  also be prohibited from creating any substitute organizations.
    


            At least two-thirds of the court's justices must be in agreement in order to make the declaration.
    


            In practical terms, if the AfD were to be banned, its sitting lawmakers would receive an automatic loss of mandate at the regional and federal level as well as in the European parliament.
    


            Of the 152 seats the AfD currently has in the Bundestag , 42 are direct seats, where the respective candidates individually won the districts by majority. These 42 districts would need to vote again to fill the seats with new candidates from other parties. The other 110 AfD seats, which are allocated using a party list system, would remain vacant until the next election cycle. Similarly, the AfD's seats in the European Parliament would remain vacant.
    


            In either case, this would result in a shifting of the majority ratio, meaning that the seats of all other parties  would gain a higher significance.
    


            The German Federal Constitutional Court has only banned two parties in the country's  history –  and both were in the early postwar years. The Socialist Reich Party (SRP), a successor to the Nazi Party, was outlawed in 1952. Four years later, in 1956, the far-left Communist Party of Germany (KPD) was also banned.
    


            Repeated attempts – in 2003, 2016 and 2021 – to ban the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) have failed. Although the court in 2017 openly acknowledged the party was unconstitutional, it found that it didn't pose a significant threat to the constitutional order. In January 2024, the court approved the freezing of the NPD's state funding for six years.
    


            Overall, Holterhus believes that it is difficult to impose a ban on a political party in Germany. “A party ban is considered a measure of last resort against the enemies of a democracy,” he said.
    


            The rise of the AfD has triggered widespread unease, with protesters calling for it to be outlawed – most notably in early 2024, when tens of thousands of demonstrators descended on cities across Germany after it emerged that senior AfD party members had discussed a plan to deport migrants en masse.
    


            Yet German lawmakers remain divided over the issue, with some fearing the move could backfire and fuel far-right sympathies.
    


            Pointing to its classification as a right-wing extremist organisation, SPD co-leader Lars Klingbeil told party members at a conference Monday that efforts to ban the AfD should begin.
    


            “The moment the domestic intelligence agency says this is a confirmed right-wing extremist party, there can be no more tactics,” he said.
    


            Yet Merz's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) – which leads Germany's coalition government – is hesitant.
    


            German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, a member of the Christian Social Union (CSU) –  the CDU's Bavarian sister party –  poured cold water on the SPD's motion. Speaking to German news podcast “Table. Today,” he said that “decisions made at the SPD party conference are not yet a mandate for the interior minister.”
    


            Merz has himself expressed caution over the move, telling newspaper Die Zeit in May that he is “skeptical” of procedures to ban political parties.
    


            The AfD's unparalleled public  approval, not to mention support from the Trump administration, a powerful transatlantic ally, means  its prohibition could have significant reverberations.
    


            Some opinion polls found that, in the weeks after the Germany's election , support for the AfD had crept up even higher than its 20.8% official  result, briefly making it the most popular party in the country.
    


            National polling agency Forsa in April found that the AfD was polling at a record 26% –  putting it two percentage points higher than the CDU, on 24%. Currently, Forsa shows the AfD  at 24% –  four points behind the CDU.
    


            With the AfD's support reaching such heights, Holterhus sees a risk of creating a “martyr effect” in the case of a ban, with the AfD “staging itself as a victim of political opponents.” This, he said, could result in further radicalization of some of its supporters and even politically motivated violence.
    


            Lengthy legal proceedings, he said, could further heighten the AfD's platform while the move also risks the “wrath” of the Trump administration and could play into the populist narrative of an “undemocratic Europe.”

            The forces that descended upon the Guadalupe River in Texas' Hill Country on Thursday night were a worst-case scenario.
    


            Four months' worth of rain fell in just hours as water-laden thunderstorms stalled in place, giving rise to a wall of water that surged down the river in the blackness of night, limiting the number of people who could get the warnings and move to higher ground.
    


            The National Weather Service warned of “life-threatening flooding” along the river in a series of alerts in the early morning hours. But questions remain about how many people they reached, whether critical vacancies at the forecast offices could have affected warning dissemination, and if so-called warning fatigue had been growing among residents in a region described as one of the most dangerous in the country for flash flooding.
    


            The National Weather Service has been hard hit by personnel cuts under the Trump administration, but that may not have significantly affected the forecasts and warnings for this historic and deadly flooding.
    


            The two Texas NWS offices most closely involved in forecasting and warning about the flooding on the Guadalupe River — Austin-San Antonio and San Angelo — are missing some key staff members, but still issued a slew of watches and warnings about the flood danger.
    


            The question is whether the warnings reached who they needed to reach.
    


            Tom Fahy, the legislative director for the NWS employees' union, told CNN that while he believes the offices had “adequate staffing and resources,” the Austin-San Antonio office is missing a warning coordination meteorologist — a role that serves as a crucial, direct link between forecasters and emergency managers.
    


            This vacancy in the Austin-San Antonio office, along with other key roles, were the result of early retirement incentives offered by the Trump administration to shrink the size of the federal government, a NOAA official told CNN.
    


            The National Weather Service began forecasting the threat of flooding in Kerr County as early as Thursday morning with a hazardous flood outlook.
    


            A flood watch was issued at 1:18 p.m. CT, that highlighted Kerrville, among other locations, as being at risk of flash flooding — though notably, as local officials have raised, the forecast was for less rainfall than what fell: as much as 5 to 7 inches for an event that ultimately dropped as much as 15 inches on parts of central Texas.
    


            Several technical forecasts followed Thursday afternoon and evening with increasingly heightened language about the magnitude of the potential flooding. At 6:30 p.m., river forecasters were calling for locally intense rain rates that would “quickly overwhelm” the ground's ability to absorb the water.
    


            “Rapid runoff is expected, with locally considerable flash and urban flash flooding possible … the nocturnal timing will also enhance the hazard potential and impacts,” the forecasters predicted. They also noted the potential for a historic rainfall event, though it's unclear if that messaging reached emergency managers.
    


            The first warning for “life-threatening flash flooding” for Kerrville came at 1:14 a.m., and was marked specifically to trigger the Emergency Alert System. It would have sounded the alarm on cell phones in the warned area, assuming those phones had service, and their users hadn't turned off EAS weather alerts.
    


            Three hours later, the Kerr County Sheriff's Office sent the first report of flooding at low-water crossings.
    


            Several other critical alerts followed, warning of the imminent threat: A flash flood emergency warning was issued for Kerr County at 4:03 a.m., followed by one for Kerrville at 5:34 a.m.
    


            The raging river burst from its banks around 5 a.m., sweeping homes, cars, campers and cabins downstream. It took about 90 minutes for the 20-foot flood wave to move down the Guadalupe River overnight Thursday, triggering the river's second-highest crest on record.
    


Several NWS offices around the country are worse off than San Angelo or Austin-San Antionio, working with such thin staffing that they no longer operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
    


            Many NWS forecast offices have ceased launching their twice-a-day weather balloons, which provide critical data that can alert forecasters to the potential for flooding and other hazardous weather.
    


            The NOAA official defended the National Weather Service forecasts, and said the disaster ultimately resulted from too much rain in too short of time in one of the most vulnerable spots in the country for flash flooding, and in the overnight hours — the worst time of day to get warnings to people in harm's way.
    


            This particular population is inundated with weather watches and warnings all times of day and night; in Texas Hill Country, where flash flooding is triggered frequently by summertime thunderstorms, warning fatigue can settle in.
    


            The Kerr County tragedy also shines a spotlight on the limitations of current forecasting technology: It is simply not yet possible to predict that a cluster of thunderstorms dumping months' worth of rain would stall out over a specific spot. Research efforts to find answers to these forecasting questions could soon slip backwards, experts warn, if the Trump administration's 2026 budget proposal is enacted — just as the country needs to push the limits on what weather models are capable of.
    


            The budget seeks to eliminate all of NOAA's weather and climate research labs along with institutes jointly run with universities around the country. The entire research division of NOAA would be eliminated under the proposal, which is subject to congressional approval.
    


            This would shut down research and development of new forecasting technologies, including computer modeling and severe weather warning scenarios, and hamper prediction of hazards including flash floods.
    


            One of the NOAA labs slated to be shut down is the National Severe Storms Lab in Norman, Oklahoma, which works to improve flash flood forecasting among other hazards from severe thunderstorms.
    


            The NOAA research cuts would come just as human-caused climate change is resulting in more frequent and intense downpours like the ones that led to this tragedy in Texas.
    


            NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster told CNN the Weather Service provided ample lead time prior to the onset of flash flooding on the Guadalupe River.
    


            “The National Weather Service is heartbroken by the tragic loss of life in Kerr County. On July 3, the NWS office in Austin/San Antonio, TX conducted forecast briefings for emergency management in the morning and issued a Flood Watch in the early afternoon,” Doster said in a statement.
    


            “Flash Flood Warnings were also issued on the night of July 3 and in the early morning of July 4, giving preliminary lead times of more than three hours before flash flooding conditions occurred.”
    


            While the July 4 flooding was worst-case, the scenario is becoming more frequent as the world warms: More rainfall coming faster than it ever has before, with forecast models inherently biased toward what we used to consider “normal.”
    


            For dozens of families, “normal” was shattered Thursday morning when they woke to torrential rain and catastrophic floodwaters that have since left at least 50 dead, including 15 children, according to local officials.
    


            As an intensive search continues for more than 20 girls in Kerr County, Texas, who remain unaccounted for after the historic flood swept dozens from a summer camp, local officials are adamant they could not have done anything more to prevent the tragedy.
    


            Gov. Greg Abbott praised federal and local officials in a long Saturday news conference and defended the response, calling it rapid in the face of a once-in-a-century flood.
    


            “Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming. We have floods all the time,” Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said at a Friday news conference. “We had no reason to believe that this was going to be anything like what's happened here. None whatsoever.”
    


            Kerr County's judge said the county does not have a warning system for flooding, while Kerrville City manager said they “could not anticipate” the severity of the flooding despite the warnings because the event happened so quickly.
    


            “There's going to be a lot of finger-pointing and a lot of second guessing and Monday morning quarterbacking,” said Texas Congressman Chip Roy. “There's a lot of people saying why and how and I understand that. I understand why parents would be asking those questions, and all of the media.”
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the government response and the National Weather Service in a Saturday news conference.
    


            “Everybody knows that the weather is extremely difficult to predict, but also that the National Weather Service, over the years, at times, has done well, and at times, we have all wanted more time and more warning and more alerts and more notification,” Noem said.
    


            The DHS Secretary said President Donald Trump wants to fix and upgrade the technology that the National Weather Service uses.
    


            “The National Weather Service has indicated that with that and NOAA, that we needed to renew this ancient system that has been left in place with the federal government for many, many years, and that is the reforms that are ongoing,” Noem said.
    


            A NOAA official said they did not know specifically what Noem was referring to, but that upgrades to agency computer networks, radars and modeling systems are underway.
    


            Some of those upgrades have been taking place since before Trump took office for his second term.

Our live coverage has moved here.



            Families are holding out hope that their loved ones are found safe after they went missing at an RV park in Kerrville, Texas, when devastating floods hit the area.
    


            Several people were reported missing from HTR TX Hill Country Campground as a number of campsites in central Texas were engulfed in floodwaters.
    


            Brad Perry was last seen around 5 a.m. on July 4, his son Alex Perry told CNN. The deluges began the evening before and continued overnight.
    


            Allison Edwards said her dad Steve Edwards was also last seen at the campground in the early morning on July 4, around the same time a flash flood emergency warning was issued in Kerr County.
    


                    “He is the best father, son, friend, and dog dad who never met a stranger,” Allison Edwards said. “He would give you the shirt off his back. He's a fighter and I know we are going to get answers and find him.”
                





            Before the heavy rain and flooding inundated the area, Melissa and Rob Kamin may have tried to leave the campground, their daughter Lorel Carr said.
    


            “My papa (Melissa's dad) mentioned that they might have tried to evacuate before the storm hit,” Carr said.
    


            At least four people have died in Travis County, Texas, after catastrophic flooding inundated parts of the area, authorities said Saturday night.
    


            Severe flooding has now killed at least 50 people in Texas, including 43 in Kerr County and three in Burnet County.
    


            Gov. Greg Abbott on Saturday signed an expanded disaster declaration, including Travis County. The county is about 130 miles northeast of hard-hit Kerr County.
    


                    “Remember – turn around, don't drown! As rain continues, be extremely cautious if you have to be out and about,” Travis County posted on social media Saturday.
                





            Travis County Judge Andy Brown told residents to “avoid flooded roads, stay tuned to official alerts, & do not attempt to return to affected areas until officials declare them safe.”
    


            The Travis County Office of Emergency Management continues to conduct search and rescue operations amid devastating flooding, Brown said.
    


            Three people are dead and two are still missing in Burnet County, Texas, Saturday after torrential rainfall caused substantial flooding, county Emergency Management Coordinator Derek Marchio told CNN.
    


            The county has suffered damage to major roadways and bridges, Marchio said.
    


            Following widespread power outages, some people are seeing their power restored Saturday evening, Marchio added.
    


            Earlier in the day, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed an expanded disaster declaration to include Burnet and five other counties.
    


            The deaths reported in Burnet County bring the death toll up to 46, with 43 fatalities reported about 114 miles away in Kerr County.
    


            Hearing the screams of a woman outside of his Texas home, Carl Jeter immediately leaped into action.
    


            The woman, who was on a camping trip with her family on the Guadalupe River, was swept away by floodwaters and separated from her family, Jeter told CNN. She was in the water for about four hours – stuck under debris-ridden water and passing several dams and a road – before pulling herself onto a tree many miles away from the campsite.
    


                    “I'm gonna get help,” Jeter told the woman who he spotted from his deck. “We're gonna make sure we get you out of there.”
                





            He then dialed 911.
    


            Thirty minutes later, authorities still hadn't arrived, so Jeter got in his car and flagged down a Department of Public Safety officer in the area. A swift water team arrived later, securing a life vest on the woman before she jumped from the tree into the team's boat.
    


            After Jeter helped rescue the woman, she waited at his home for a few hours until a family member picked her up and took her to the hospital.
    


                    “It's a true miracle,” Jeter said. “We've been on the river for a long time and that's not something that is survivable.”
                





            The father of Blair, 13, and Brooke Harber, 11 has confirmed to CNN his daughters have died. Blair and Brooke, pictured left to right, went missing during the catastrophic flooding in Kerr County, Texas.
    


            Neither girl was attending Camp Mystic at the time of their disappearance.
    


                    Blair “was a gifted student and had a generous kind heart,” RJ Harber told CNN. Brooke “was like a light in any room, people gravitated to her and she made them laugh and enjoy the moment.”
                





            RJ Harber's parents, Charlene and Mike Harber, are still missing but he believes the couple is deceased, he told CNN.
    


            Search and rescue operations remain the priority in central Texas, according to Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice, as crews continue to look for the missing along the Guadalupe River.
    


                    “We're really focused on life safety,” he said. “Our primary focus is on search and rescue of every single person involved, and we'll continue through the night to make sure that happens.”
                





            He added authorities were recovering and identifying bodies Saturday. “We knew today was going to be that day, so our numbers are going to constantly be changing,” he said.
    


            “We're in a marathon, and we got to make sure we always think about that and look after each other,” Rice said.
    


            There are still 27 children missing from Camp Mystic, Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said at a Saturday news conference, as officials rescue people from campsites after the Guadalupe River surged Friday.
    


            “We've been rescuing people out of these camps by the hundreds all day,” Rice said.
    


            The private Christian summer camp is nestled near the Guadalupe River, which rose more than 20 feet in less than two hours during torrential rains Friday that triggered flash flooding in parts of Texas.
    


            Everyone at the approximately 18 other nearby camps along the river has been accounted for, officials previously said.
    


            Rice said the holiday weekend complicates counting missing people outside of the total missing from Camp Mystic, so officials won't be providing that number.
    


            “Campers are coming in for Fourth of July weekend, people are camped along the river bank, people are coming in to visit – there's a number that we just don't know yet,” he said. “We're not going to put a cap on this; we'll just continue until we find everything else.”
    


            At least 43 people died in Kerr County, Texas, after severe flooding hit the state, according to Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha.
    


            The fatalities include 28 adults and 15 children, Leitha said at a news conference Saturday. The sheriff added five children and 12 adults have yet to be identified.
    


                    “We knew today was going to be that day, so our numbers are going to constantly be changing,” Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said. “We are constantly working on identification.”
                





            Officials in Texas will hold what they expect will be their last news conference of the day at 6 p.m. CT (7 p.m. ET) in Kerrville. Authorities will provide updates on the state's response to severe flooding impacting parts of Texas as search and rescue efforts continue.
    


            The official death toll has risen further following catastrophic flooding in parts of central Texas.
    


            At least 32 people, including 14 children, have died, according to local officials. There are still more than two dozen people missing from Camp Mystic, a girls summer camp in Kerr County.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed an expanded disaster declaration today, adding six new counties, and vowed to continue adding others as needed.

Federal response: 



            A US Congressman says his two daughters were evacuated from Camp Mystic, the hard-hit summer camp for girls in Hunt, Texas, where more than 20 campers are still missing.
    


            Rep. August Pfluger announced he and his wife were “now reunited” with their daughters in a post on X Saturday.
    


            “The last day has brought unimaginable grief to many families and we mourn with them as well as holding out hope for survivors,” he wrote.
    


            “Please join us today as we pray for miracles,” he added.
    


            CNN's Ed Lavandera got a firsthand look at the destruction from flooding at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas, where the Guadalupe River rose more than 20 feet in less than two hours during torrential rains that triggered flash flooding in parts of the state yesterday.
    


            More than 20 campers remain unaccounted for after the disaster.
    


Watch Lavandera's report below:



            Renee Smajstrla, the 8-year-old Camp Mystic camper who went missing during the torrential flooding in Kerr County, Texas, has passed away, her family confirmed to CNN.
    


            “It's truly devastating,” Shawn Salta, Smajstrla's uncle, told CNN.
    


            Salta said his niece was recovered on Friday.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the government response and the National Weather Service in the wake of the tragic flooding in Texas that has left 32 people dead, including 14 children.
    


            “When President Trump took office…he said he wanted to fix, and is currently upgrading the technology. And the National Weather Service has indicated that with that and NOAA, that we needed to renew this ancient system that has been left in place with the federal government for many, many years, and that is the reforms that are ongoing,” Noem said.
    


            The president's Fiscal Year 2026 budget, which the administration is already abiding by, does make cuts and even closes some weather research labs that are vital to forecast improvement. The Department of Government Efficiency, formerly led by Elon Musk, has also cut hundreds of employees at NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the NWS.
    


            Asked about the impact of those cuts during a press conference Saturday, Noem continued to defend the government and the president, saying that she will bring “concerns back to the federal government.”
    


            “I do carry your concerns back to the federal government, and to President Trump, and we will do all we can to fix those kind of things that that may have felt like a failure to you and to your community members, but we know that everybody wants more warning time, and that's why we're working to upgrade the technologies have been neglected by far too long,” Noem said.
    


            Still, this storm was extremely unpredictable and truly unprecedented, the water rising very high very quickly.
    


            As CNN has previously reported, the NWS issued a flood watch early Thursday afternoon that highlighted Kerr County as a place at high risk of flash flooding through the overnight. A flash flood warning was issued for Kerr County as early as around 1 a.m. CT on Friday. A more dire flash flood emergency warning was then issued for Kerr County at 4:03 a.m. CT, followed by another one for Kerrville at 5:34 a.m. CT.
    


Correction: This post has been updated to reflect that Trump's fiscal year budget is what affects the National Weather Service.



            As flood waters recede in central Texas, ground crews are able to uncover and search additional areas, Texas Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said.
    


                    “The entire river is being searched from the northernmost impact all the way as we run down. You have assets in the air that are still doing searches. You have boats that are in the water doing searches. And you have ground crews doing searches,” Kidd said.
                





            Dogs are also assisting in searching banks where people may be missing, Kidd said. Crews are assigned to different areas and are reporting back to command if they find anyone, he added.
    


                    “That process is going to keep going,” he said at a news conference Saturday. “We are not stopping until we find everyone that's missing.”
                





            At least 32 people, including 14 children, are dead following torrential rains and flooding in Texas, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said at a Saturday news conference.
    


            The sheriff's office is working to identify some of the deceased, Leitha said. Officials are still working to locate the 27 people still missing from Camp Mystic, he added.
    


            The private Christian summer camp is nestled near the Guadalupe River, which surged suddenly on Friday amid relentless rainfall. Everyone at the approximately 18 other nearby camps along the river has been accounted for, officials previously said.
    


            Camp Mystic, located in the unincorporated community of Hunt in western Kerr County, Texas, hosts approximately 750 children.
    


            Officials said Saturday afternoon that search efforts will continue until everyone who is missing is found.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott underscored the urgent focus on finding survivors of the devastating floods during a press conference Saturday, and said he is directing all state agencies involved to prioritize lifesaving operations.
    


            “My instruction to every state agency involved in this is to assume everybody who is missing is alive,” Abbott said. “And there's a need for speed, not just every hour, every minute counts, which is why there's people in the air, people in the water, people on the ground right now, because they're looking to save every last life.”
    


            Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, echoed the governor's message, making it clear while the shift from rescue to recovery operations will eventually be necessary, the current mindset is firmly focused on rescue.
    


            “History would tell us that after a certain time period, those chances (of survival) diminish,” Kidd said. “Our hope and prayer is that there are still people alive that are out there, and we're still actively searching for them.”
    


            US Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said state officials are “far from having finished the job” of search, rescue and recovery after deadly floods hit the state.
    


                    “We're all here knowing that we still have work to do. We're still prayerful, we're still hopeful,” Roy said during a news conference today.
                





            Authorities say more than 20 girls are still unaccounted for at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas. Roy noted the “heroic efforts of people that worked in those camps, directors of the camps, people who own the camps, who not just risk their lives, gave their lives to try to go save the lives of those kids, that's who they are as Texans.”
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem addressed the ongoing federal response to the catastrophic flooding in Texas, emphasizing the urgent need for resources, coordination and continued federal support as the search for missing people intensifies.
    


            In addition to ground efforts, federal officials have requested more aviation assets to aid in aerial search and rescue.
    


            “We, just at the request of a previous conversation less than an hour ago … requested more fixed-wing aircraft from the Coast Guard to come and help us,” Noem said. She added many of the aircraft will be equipped with thermal imaging to allow round-the-clock searches.
    


            “Some of the assets that other agencies may offer don't have that kind of equipment but the Coast Guard does have it so that will be deployed so that the search and rescue efforts don't stop even when it does get dark at night.”
    


            She reassured Texans FEMA would remain fully engaged and ready to provide additional assistance based on evolving needs from state leadership.
    


            “We'll continue to stay engaged, and I'll be here,” Noem said, noting her plans to visit Camp Mystic, where more than 20 girls are still unaccounted for, along with other parts of the community to assess damage and offer support.
    


            “The number one priority now is people,” Noem stated. “(It) is making sure we're finding people as fast as possible and we're returning them to their families.”
    


            While damage assessments to infrastructure are ongoing as bridges, roads and power lines have all sustained impact, she said the focus remains on saving lives before turning fully to long-term recovery.
    


            “The state of Texas is amazing in how it responds to disasters,” she said. “You are an example to the nation of getting through these difficult times. But also know that you're not alone, that you have the entire country's hearts with you.”

TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — The voices of tens of thousands of choir singers rang out in the rain in Estonia on Sunday, and a huge crowd of spectators erupted in applause, unfazed by the gloomy weather.

The Song Festival Grounds, a massive outdoor venue in the Estonian capital Tallinn, was filled with spectators Saturday evening despite the downpour, and absolutely packed on Sunday, with even more people attending. The traditional Song and Dance Celebration, which decades ago inspired resistance to Soviet control and was later recognized by the U.N.'s cultural agency, attracted tens of thousands of performers and spectators alike, many in national costume. 

The four-day choir-singing and dancing event centers around Estonian folk songs and patriotic anthems and is held roughly every five years. The tradition dates back to the 19th century. In the late 1980s, it inspired the defiant Singing Revolution, helping Estonia and other Baltic nations break free from the Soviet occupation. 

To this day, it remains a major point of national pride for a country of about 1.3 million.

This year, tickets to the main event -– a seven-hour concert on Sunday featuring choirs of all ages -– sold out weeks in advance.

Rasmus Puur, a conductor at the song festival and assistant to the artistic director, ascribes the spike in popularity to Estonians longing for a sense of unity in the wake of the global turmoil, especially Russia's war in Ukraine.

“We want to feel as one today more than six years ago (when the celebration was last held), and we want to feel that we are part of Estonia,” Puur told The Associated Press on Friday. 





The theme of the song festival this year is dialects and regional languages, and the repertoire is a mix of folk songs, well-known patriotic anthems that are traditionally sung at these celebrations and new pieces written specifically for the occasion.

The festival's artistic director, Heli Jürgenson, says that although the audience won't know all the songs -– especially those sung in dialects -– there will be many opportunities to sing along.

The main concert on Sunday night will end with a song called “My Fatherland is My Love” –- a patriotic song Estonians spontaneously sang at the 1960 festival in protest against the Soviet regime. Every song celebration since 1965 has concluded with this anthem in what both performers and spectators describe as the highest emotional point of the whole event.

An emotional Jürgenson, who this year will conduct a combined choir of about 19,000 people singing it, said: “This is a very special moment.”

She believes that what drove the tradition more than 150 years ago still drives it today.

“There have been different turning points, there have been a lot of historical twists, but the need for singing, songs and people have remained the same,” she said. “There are certain songs that we always sing, that we want to sing. This is what keeps this tradition going for over 150 years.” 



The tradition to hold massive first song-only, then song and dance festivals dates back to the time when Estonia was part of the Russian Empire. 

The first song celebration was held in 1869 in the southern city of Tartu. It heralded a period of national awakening for Estonians, when Estonian-language press, theater and other things emerged, says Elo-Hanna Seljamaa, associate professor at the University of Tartu.

The festivals continued throughout a period of Estonia's independence between the two world wars and then during the nearly 50 years of Soviet occupation. 

The Soviet rulers were into “mass spectacles of all kinds, so in a way it was very logical for the Soviet regime to tap into this tradition and to try to co-opt it,” Seljamaa said in an interview.

Estonians had to sing Soviet propaganda songs in Russian during that time, but they were also able to sing their own songs in their own language, which was both an act of defiance and an act of therapy for them, she said.

At the same time, the complicated logistics of putting together a mass event like that taught Estonians to organize, Seljamaa said, so when the political climate changed in the 1980s, the protest against the Soviet rule naturally came in the form of coming together and singing.

The unity extended beyond Estonia's borders. During the Singing Revolution, 2 million people in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania joined hands to form a 600-kilometer (370-mile) human chain that protested Soviet occupation of the Baltics with a song.

In 2003, the United Nations' cultural body, UNESCO, recognized Estonia's folk song festival and similar events in Latvia and Lithuania for showcasing the “intangible cultural heritage of humanity.”



Marina Nurming recalls attending the Singing Revolution gatherings in the 1980s as a teenager. This year she traveled to Tallinn from Luxembourg, where she currently lives, to take part in the Song and Dance Celebration as a choir singer –- her longtime hobby.

The Singing Revolution is a time “when we sang ourselves free,” she told AP.

Seljamaa says the song and dance celebration may have suffered a drop in popularity in the 1990s, a somewhat difficult time for Estonia as it was emerging as an independent country after the Soviet Union collapsed, but has since bounced back.

There is a tremendous interest in it among young people, she says, and always more performers willing to take part than the venue can fit in, and there are people who had left Estonia to live abroad, but travel back to take part.

Nurming is one example. She is part of the European Choir of Estonians – a singing group that unites Estonians from more than a dozen countries.



This year's four-day celebration, which started on Thursday, included several stadium dancing performances by over 10,000 dancers from all around the country and a folk music instrument concert.

It culminated over the weekend with the song festival featuring some 32,000 choir singers. That was preceded by a large procession, in which all participants -– singers, dancers, musicians, clad in traditional costumes and waving Estonian flags –- marched from the city center to the Song Festival Grounds by the Baltic Sea.

Those taking part come from all corners of Estonia, and there are collectives from abroad, as well. It's a mix of men, women and children, with participants aged from six to 93.

For most, singing and dancing is a hobby on top of their day jobs or studies. But to take part in the celebration, collectives had to go through a rigorous selection process, and months worth of rehearsals.

For Karl Kesküla, an electrical engineer from Estonia's western island of Saaremaa, this is the first time taking part in the song celebration as a singer -– but he attended it before as a spectator.

“I got the feeling that what they did was really special and almost, like, every person you meet has gone to it or been a part of it at least once. So I just wanted that feeling too,” Kesküla, 30, told the AP at the procession on Saturday. 



Participants described the celebrations as being an important part of their national identity.

“Estonians are always getting through the hard times through songs, through songs and dances. If it's hard, we sing together and that brings everything back together and then we forget our troubles,” singer Piret Jakobson said.

“It's really good with all Estonian people to do the same thing,” said engineer Taavi Pentma, who took part in the dance performances. “So we are, like, breathing in one and the heart is beating (as one).”

Some 100 members of the European Choir of Estonians came to the Song Celebration this year from various corners of Europe. Among them is Kaja Kriis, who traveled from Germany, where she's been living for the last 25 years.

“Estonia is my home,” she said, adding that it's important for her “to be together with my friends, to keep my Estonian language, to maintain the Estonian language and Estonian culture.”

KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) — Before heading to bed before the Fourth of July holiday, Christopher Flowers checked the weather while staying at a friend's house along the Guadalupe River. Nothing in the forecast alarmed him.

Hours later, he was rushing to safety: He woke up in darkness to electrical sockets popping and ankle-deep water. Quickly, his family scrambled nine people into the attic. Phones buzzed with alerts, Flowers recalled Saturday, but he did not remember when in the chaos they started.

“What they need is some kind of external system, like a tornado warning that tells people to get out now,” Flowers, 44, said.

The destructive fast-moving waters that began before sunrise Friday in the Texas Hill Country killed at least 43 people in Kerr County, authorities said Saturday, and an unknown number of people remained missing. Those still unaccounted for included 27 girls from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along a river in Kerr County where most of the dead were recovered.

But as authorities launch one of the largest search-and-rescue efforts in recent Texas history, they have come under intensifying scrutiny over preparations and why residents and youth summer camps that are dotted along the river were not alerted sooner or told to evacuate. 

The National Weather Service sent out a series of flash flood warnings in the early hours Friday before issuing flash flood emergencies — a rare alert notifying of imminent danger.




Local officials have insisted that no one saw the flood potential coming and have defended their actions. 

“There's going to be a lot of finger-pointing, a lot of second-guessing and Monday morning quarterbacking,” said Republican U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, whose district includes Kerr County. “There's a lot of people saying ‘why' and ‘how,' and I understand that.”

An initial flood watch — which generally urges residents to be weather-aware — was issued by the local National Weather Service office at 1:18 p.m. Thursday.

It predicted between 5 to 7 inches (12.7 to 17.8 centimeters) of rain. Weather messaging from the office, including automated alerts delivered to mobile phones to people in threatened areas, grew increasingly ominous in the early morning hours of Friday, urging people to move to higher ground and evacuate flood-prone areas, said Jason Runyen, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service office.

At 4:03 a.m., the office issued an urgent warning that raised the potential of catastrophic damage and a severe threat to human life.

Jonathan Porter, the chief meteorologist at AccuWeather, a private weather forecasting company that uses National Weather Service data, said it appeared evacuations and other proactive measures could have been undertaken to reduce the risk of fatalities.

“People, businesses, and governments should take action based on Flash Flood Warnings that are issued, regardless of the rainfall amounts that have occurred or are forecast,” Porter said in a statement.

Local officials have said they had not expected such an intense downpour that was the equivalent of months' worth of rain for the area.

“We know we get rains. We know the river rises,” said Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, the county's top elected official. “But nobody saw this coming.”

Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said he was jogging along the river early in the morning and didn't notice any problems at 4 a.m. A little over an hour later, at 5:20 a.m., the water level had risen dramatically and “we almost weren't able to get out of the park,” he said. 

Rice also noted that the public can become desensitized to too many weather warnings.

Kelly said the county considered a flood warning system along the river that would have functioned like a tornado warning siren about six or seven years ago, before he was elected, but that the idea never got off the ground because of the expense. 

“We've looked into it before … The public reeled at the cost,” Kelly said.

He said he didn't know what kind of safety and evacuation plans the camps may have had.

“What I do know is the flood hit the camp first, and it came in the middle of the night. I don't know where the kids were,” he said. “I don't know what kind of alarm systems they had. That will come out in time.”

U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said Saturday it was difficult for forecasters to predict just how much rain would fall. She said the Trump administration would make it a priority to upgrade National Weather Service technology used to deliver warnings.

“We know that everyone wants more warning time, and that's why we're working to upgrade the technology that's been neglected for far too long to make sure families have as much advance notice as possible,” Noem said during a press conference with state and federal leaders. 

The National Weather Service office in New Braunfels, which delivers forecasts for Austin, San Antonio and the surrounding areas, had extra staff on duty during the storms, Runyen said. 

Where the office would typically have two forecasters on duty during clear weather, they had up to five on staff.

“There were extra people in here that night, and that's typical in every weather service office — you staff up for an event and bring people in on overtime and hold people over,” Runyen said.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem joins ‘Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss protesters clashing with ICE officers during federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, and the response by local leaders.

The Trump administration is taking a ""zero tolerance"" approach to attacks on law enforcement after a Texas police officer was shot outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center.

The message came after similar incidents in other cities amid backlash against President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement agency. 

An Alvarado, Texas, police officer was shot Friday night near the Prairieland Detention Facility, authorities said.

Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson reports on President Donald Trump's Fourth of July party, the ‘big, beautiful bill' signing and more on ‘Fox Report.'

A fighter jet scrambled by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) intercepted a civilian aircraft Saturday afternoon after it entered restricted airspace over Bedminster, New Jersey, where President Donald Trump is spending the holiday weekend.

The pilot flew into a temporary flight restriction (TFR) zone just before 2:40 p.m. ET, according to a NORAD statement. 

The aircraft was safely escorted out of the area after a standard ""headbutt"" maneuver was used to get the pilot's attention. The maneuver involves a military jet flying directly in front of a civilian aircraft at a close but safe distance to visually signal the pilot to either follow or change course.

This was the fourth restricted airspace violation of the day and not the last.

NORAD says another incursion happened later, making for five unauthorized entries by five different aircraft in a single day over presidential airspace.

NORAD confirmed a total of three intercepts on July 5. The first took place over the Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA) and was carried out by a U.S. Coast Guard MH-65 Blackjack helicopter. The second, near Bedminster, was the F-16 interception involving the headbutt maneuver. Later, there were two additional intercepts over the SFRA, one by another MH-65 Blackjack, and one involving both an MH-65 and an F-16.

In a message to pilots, NORAD stressed: ""It is critically important for North American flight safety that Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) violations are avoided. All pilots must familiarize themselves with updates to restricted airspace, including reviewing new and existing FAA NOTAMs that impact their flight plans and activities. Adhering to FAA restricted airspace protocols is mandatory, regardless of geographical region, airframe, or aircrew.""

The FAA did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Maryland officials from Prince George's County have pledged to fight the Trump administration's decision to keep the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.

The FBI announced its new headquarters will be moved to the Ronald Reagan Building complex in Washington, D.C., in a press release on July 1. The headquarters had planned to move to Greenbelt, Maryland, where a building was going to be constructed specially for it.

However, President Donald Trump vetoed the order issued by the Biden administration in 2023, citing the high costs of the construction project that would fall on taxpayers. Maryland leaders objected to the move, claiming the new headquarters in Maryland would have helped the area and its local businesses.

“We won it fair and square,” said Prince George's County Executive Aisha Braveboy, reported by NBC4 Washington. “We intend to use every resource and strategy in order to continue to advocate for the headquarters moving here to Prince George's County.”

Leaders' frustration can also be attributed to their more than decade-long effort to see the headquarters relocated to Maryland, as well as having to put other projects on hold in anticipation of the relocation.

“Why even have a process if it can be blown up at the last minute and somebody else can arbitrarily assign it another site?” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) to NBC4 Washington. 

The Trump administration stands by its decision, as does FBI Director Kash Patel. “Moving to the Ronald Reagan Building is the most cost effective and resource efficient way to carry out our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution,” said Patel in the press release.

Stephen Ehikian, acting Administrator for the General Services Administration, also endorses the move to the Reagan building. “I am proud of the GSA's commitment to working with Director Patel and his FBI team to find a building that best supports their mission and their people,” he said.

In the meantime, Maryland leaders plan to do everything they can to stop the relocation to the Reagan building, arguing that Congress still needs to approve the move.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Rampant court shopping against Trump gets reprieve with Supreme Court decision","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3452826/court-shopping-trump-reprieve-supreme-court-decision/","Sun, 06 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

President Donald Trump has faced various legal setbacks early in his second term which have been exacerbated through court shopping by his opponents, but a recent Supreme Court decision could help offer some relief.

Court shopping, also known as forum shopping or judge shopping, has been a frequently used tactic by opponents of the Trump administration seeking favorable rulings and quick blocks of key parts of Trump's agenda. 

The tactic involves parties suing the administration to file their lawsuits in a federal judicial district with a heavily liberal bench of judges. Because the federal government has jurisdiction over the entire country, groups can file lawsuits against the government in a wider array of districts than in typical cases.

Lawsuits challenging Trump executive orders and actions have been filed in federal districts across the country, but several courts have been frequent venues for the opponents of Trump's agenda to file against the administration.

The U.S. District Courts for the District of Columbia, the District of Massachusetts, the Northern District of California, the District of Maryland, and the Southern District of New York, have popped up as the most common venues for legal challenges against the Trump administration, they also happen to be courts where a Democrat appointee is more likely to preside.

In the District of Columbia, there are only four Trump-appointed judges, while the rest of the bench is dominated by appointees of former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Bill Clinton, while the District of Maryland only has one Trump appointee and a bench similarly stacked with Democrat-appointed judges. The Southern District of New York also only has four Trump appointees, while the District of Massachusetts and the Northern District of California have no Trump-appointed judges on the bench.

Zack Smith, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Florida and Senior Legal Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, believes liberal groups and opponents suing Trump have been “strategic in where they filed their lawsuits.”

“Many of these lawsuits are being filed in places like California, Washington State, New York, Boston, other courts around the country where I suspect litigants are more likely to get a favorable with those challenging these policies, expect to get a more favorable judge who might be more inclined to rule in their favor,” Smith told the Washington Examiner.

When Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) launched a lawsuit against Trump's deployment of the National Gaurd to Los Angeles, he and other state officials filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The state officials filed in that court rather than the eastern district of California, where the state capital of Sacramento is located, or in the central district of California, where Los Angeles is located.

The Justice Department argued in a court filing that the state had “engaged in forum shopping in making San Francisco the venue for their lawsuit about Los Angeles,” requesting discovery in the case be conducted in the Central District of California.

“Nearly every fact relevant to this dispute occurred in the Central District of California, and the consequences of the final judgment entered in this case will be felt by those who live in that district. But Plaintiffs nonetheless chose to sue in San Francisco, which has emerged as a favorite forum for those challenging this administration's policies,” the DOJ argued in a June 25 filing.

“Their gamesmanship at the expense of citizens impacted by the case and witnesses should not be permitted,” the filing continued.

Judge Charles Breyer, a Clinton appointee, rejected the bid to transfer the discovery to the other court, noting it would force the other court to quickly get up to speed on the case and called the DOJ's accusation of court shopping “conclusory.”

A major issue with court shopping is that groups and persons bringing lawsuits are inclined to bring them in venues they believe can hear the case and may be favorable for their desired outcome.

“I think litigants are always going to seek to find the most favorable form they can to bring their claims in their claims that this was part and parcel of litigation process,” Smith said.

While conservatives and Trump allies have raged over court shopping early into his term, as John Shu, a constitutional law scholar who served in both Bush administrations, noted to the Washington Examiner, that “sometimes, but not as often, conservatives are guilty of the same” tactics.

“There's plenty of hypocrisy to go around on both sides,” Shu said. “I think this court shopping business is really terrible.”

During the Biden administration, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas became a popular place for conservative groups to file lawsuits, hoping to have Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, assigned to their case.

Kacsmaryk granted legal wins and universal injunctions to conservative groups in several key cases during the Biden administration, including maintaining the “remain in Mexico” policy from Trump's first term and halting the FDA approval of the popular abortion pill mifepristone.

“He's pretty conservative, and before he became a judge, when he was an advocate, he had written plenty of articles about being pro-life,” Shu said.

“So [the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine] sued there, and obviously they got their nationwide injunction on mifepristone. They eventually lost at the Supreme Court on standing, but they still managed to get their district court nationwide injunction,” Shu added. “When they did that all the liberals were upset about nationwide injunctions.”

During the Biden administration, left-leaning law professors, scholars, and politicians raged against the tactic. Georgetown University Law professor Stephen Vladeck, writing for the New York Times in 2023, that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had “made the loophole into an art form” with getting his cases before Kacsmaryk.

Justice Elena Kagan, a part of the liberal wing of the high court, expressed her concern over forum shopping and district courts issuing universal injunctions to halt presidential or congressional actions during a talk at Northwestern University's law school in 2022.

“It just can't be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks, and leave it stopped for the years that it takes to go through normal process,” Kagan said, lamenting how people “forum shop” which district court they file in.

When Trump returned to power in January, and the flurry of cases were filed against Trump in liberal judicial districts, much of the uproar from the legal left-wing over forum shopping has quitted, as some legal scholars argue it has become a more prevalent problem in the past 6 months.

“There's a particular focus on several lawsuits that were filed during the Biden administration in Texas, in front of Judge Kacsmaryk, there's a lot of anger and frustration expressed by many on the left because of that,” Smith said, while noting where liberal groups have filed lawsuits during the second Trump term.

“It looks like the left has engaged in those same types of strategic decisions, trying to find the friendliest forum to follow their cases in, and yet, you haven't heard the same type of outcry that you heard from many of the commentators that commented on this during the Biden administration,” he added.

Shu noted how liberal groups are more aggressive with the tactic of court shopping, but that the significant number of liberal courts where those groups can file also exacerbates it.

“It's really out of hand, and in the past, both conservative and liberals have gone forum shopping, court shopping, but the liberals are super aggressive about it, and I think it's because they have more judges,” Shu told the Washington Examiner. “They have more jurisdictions where they can file to get the results they want.”

While there are no firm ways to end the abuse of forum shopping, the Supreme Court's decision last month limiting the use of nationwide injunctions is an “important win” in curbing the practice, Smith told the Washington Examiner.

The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in Trump v. CASA that universal injunctions, blocking laws or policies from being enforced against anyone, “likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to federal courts.” The ruling, in a case which originated out of a trio of universal injunctions against Trump's birthright citizenship order, has taken a key power out of district courts' hands.

Smith said he hopes the high court's ruling will “ameliorate some of the concerns about judge shopping or foreign shopping” by providing the death knell to universal injunctions. He is optimistic it will lower the stakes of which forum a case is heard in.

“The stakes are much higher if you can get a single federal district court judge from anywhere in the country to issue a nationwide injunction, and so if that tool is taken away, hopefully that might lower the temperature, lower the stakes around some of the forum selection that we've seen so far,” Smith said.

SUPREME COURT'S DEATH KNELL TO UNIVERSAL INJUNCTIONS CHANGES TRUMP LEGAL LANDSCAPE

Shu also agreed that the decision in Trump v. CASA is a positive development, but with other avenues for sweeping relief, including class action lawsuits, court shopping may still persist in the legal battles against the Trump administration.

“I think it's a good thing that the Supreme Court ruled the way it did on nationwide injunctions, and I hope we will see a reduction in forum shopping and court shopping,” Shu said.  

“Only time will tell,” Shu added, “but I certainly hope it happens.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Trump administration deported eight migrants convicted of various crimes to South Sudan after weeks of legal back-and-forth between district courts, the Justice Department, and ultimately the Supreme Court, which twice ruled the deportations could take place.

At around 8:30 p.m. Eastern time on July 4, a military plane carrying the eight migrants departed the U.S. military base in Djibouti, where they were held as the deportation effort was delayed by lower court stays and injunctions. The plane arrived in South Sudan less than four hours later, shortly before midnight on Friday, according to CBS News.

A photo later shared by the Department of Homeland Security showed the migrants, all handcuffed, aboard the plane and surrounded by military officials.

The migrants' arrival in South Sudan came mere hours after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., issued an administrative stay on the deportation effort, barring DHS from “moving, transferring, or removing” the eight men while the court considered a new constitutional challenge to their removal.

That new challenge was an emergency habeas petition, which argued that sending the men to the war-torn African nation would amount to unlawful punishment in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth amendments.

Following his stay on the deportation effort, however, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss moved the case to Massachusetts, where U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy reportedly had the final word before the scheduled deportation flight and a threat of another appeal to the Supreme Court by the DOJ if it was blocked again.

Murphy ultimately denied the migrants' attorney's request for a temporary restraining order on their deportations to South Sudan, citing an earlier Supreme Court ruling.

“This Court interprets these Supreme Court orders as binding on this new petition, as Petitioners are now raising substantially similar claims, and therefore Petitioners motion is denied,” Murphy said in the ruling.

Murphy's ruling paved the way for the migrants' removal to the East African Country, which the Supreme Court had already greenlit in two separate rulings.

Both of those orders from the high court involved previous rulings from Murphy.

In late June, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to resume deporting criminal migrants to “third countries,” or places where they did not originate, including South Sudan. That included granting an emergency request from the DOJ to block a lower court ruling from Murphy that required the administration to give deportees a “meaningful opportunity” to raise fear-based claims before being sent to countries where they face torture or death.

JUDGE TEMPORARILY HALTS SOUTH SUDAN DEPORTATIONS DESPITE TRUMP WINS AT SUPREME COURT

In the second ruling, the Supreme Court ruled late this week that Murphy overstepped by trying to block the South Sudan deportations despite the previous order.

All of the eight migrants deported to South Sudan have been convicted of serious crimes in the United States. Only one of them is from South Sudan, while the others are from Vietnam, Mexico, Laos, Cuba, and Myanmar.

Iran and Israel came to blows, and Beijing mostly ducked.

China isn't ready to be the world's next superpower: That's one thing the exchange of fire between Israel and Iran in June made abundantly clear.

The country that was perhaps Tehran's most important diplomatic and economic partner wound up playing virtually no role when Iran and Israel came to blows. This, despite the fact that Beijing has actively sought stronger relations with many countries in the Middle East—not just Iran but also Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—and despite China's evident stake in promoting stability in a region that supplies more than half of its oil imports.

So why didn't China step up?

Beijing did make some effort to assert its influence. In mid-June, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed a four-point plan, calling for a cease-fire and negotiations to contend with Iran's nuclear program, and offering to play a “constructive role” in restoring peace. But Xi's proposal went nowhere. He couldn't bring the belligerents to the table—especially not Israel.

Read: The Iran-China-Russia axis crumbles when it matters

The two countries have never been particularly close, and Beijing deeply offended the Israeli leadership by taking a pro-Hamas position after the group's October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israeli civilians. But amid Israel's recent military successes, Beijing has tried to soften its approach. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has opened a dialogue with his Israeli counterparts and in a phone call in October stated that China “is ready to resume exchanges in all aspects as soon as possible,” according to an official summary of his comments.

But Israel's leaders are likely to remain cautious, given China's relationship with Tehran. In the recent past, Beijing has helped the Iranians circumvent Washington-led sanctions and diplomatic pressure. Alongside Russia and India, China has welcomed Iran into two important forums: the BRICS group of emerging economies and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, an association of countries connected to Central Asia. And China purchases nearly all of Iran's oil exports, providing vital resources to its moribund economy.

Given these links, Chinese leaders might be expected to wield influence over Tehran. They've done so in the past: In 2015, China encouraged Iran's leadership to join the Obama administration's nuclear deal, and in 2023, it brokered a détente between Tehran and its regional rival, Saudi Arabia. But if China and Iran are too close for Israel's comfort, they are still not as close as they appear to be.

Iran certainly has reason to question whether China is fully committed to the relationship. In 2021, China promised to invest $400 billion in Iran over 25 years as part of an enhanced strategic partnership, but progress toward that goal has been slow. Chinese cumulative direct investment in Iran reached only $3.9 billion at the end of 2023. And Chinese companies have been wary of doing business with Iran due to U.S. sanctions—a risk made clear when Meng Wanzhou, now deputy chair of the telecom giant Huawei, was detained in Canada in 2018 at Washington's request on sanctions-related charges. China also takes advantage of Iran's vulnerability by purchasing its oil at steep discounts. As a result, Tehran has tried to balance Chinese influence by maintaining strong ties to India, Beijing's chief rival within the developing world.

The Iranians also undoubtedly know that China can't ultimately protect them from the United States and Israel. Trade with China cannot fully substitute for real relief from Western sanctions. Beijing isn't likely to pressure Washington into lifting them, either. And although China has been steadily upgrading its armed forces, it still can't project military power all the way to the Middle East. Beijing probably wouldn't want to do so anyway: It tends to eschew the sorts of close alliances and mutual-defense arrangements that Washington routinely forges with other governments. “China is not trying to be the security provider in the Middle East, and honestly, no one has asked China to,” Yun Sun, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center who specializes in Chinese foreign policy, told me.

Read: Why isn't Russia defending Iran?

Beijing's response to the Israel-Iran conflict reflected all of these limitations. Foreign Minister Wang Yi has offered his Iranian counterpart little beyond diplomatic support. “As a security partner, China is not there” for Iran, Mohammed Baharoon, the director general of the Dubai Public Policy Research Center, told me. “If we are talking about a security situation, like the war, Russia has a closer relationship with Iran than China.”

For many in the Middle East, China's standoffishness doesn't seem like the worst thing: Beijing isn't doing anything to escalate the Israel-Iran conflict, either. But then, China is also in no position to challenge or provide a counterweight to the United States in the region. The Gulf states have cultivated ever more trade and investment with China—but they still crave close diplomatic and economic relations with Washington above all. President Donald Trump's May visit, during which the Gulf royals lavishly feted him,“is proof that the U.S. is the most important partner for these countries,” Jonathan Fulton, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who monitors Chinese policy in the Middle East from Abu Dhabi, told me. Within the region, China is not seen as “leading political, strategic, diplomatic, and economic issues. Right now, there is really only one country that does all of that, and that's the U.S.”

The same is true on a global scale. Xi attempted to mediate between Russia and Ukraine, and to promote his own peace proposal, after Moscow's invasion in 2022. But his all-too-obvious favor for Russia undercut his credibility as a broker. Efforts to intervene in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza in 2023 fell flat due to Beijing's overt pro-Palestinian bias. Wang Yi repeatedly called for a cease-fire, but the U.S. engaged in the consistent diplomacy that eventually produced one. In both cases, Xi exploited the crises to further Chinese interests—deepening ties to a desperate and isolated Russian President Vladimir Putin, and scoring propaganda points in the global South by criticizing Washington's support for Israel.

China's actions in these crises are indicative of its true role in global affairs. The so-called axis of authoritarianism—China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea—is not a tightly coordinated cabal. And China's economic heft is not translating into political and military power as quickly as it could be. Chinese leaders just haven't marshaled the diplomatic and military muscle—still less the political will—to usurp America's position as the world's premier power. To get there, Chinese leaders will need not just more resources and experience but also a new vision for their role in the world.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

A religious movement that has so often taken public stands has been unusually quiet since Trump gutted the program to combat AIDS in Africa.

I

n 2006, Ambassador Mark Dybul, then the United States global AIDS coordinator, visited an orphanage run by the Daughters of Charity in Ethiopia. It was a sanctuary for more than 400 HIV-positive babies and young children found in garbage heaps, abandoned on the roadside, or left at the orphanage door. As Dybul and Michael Gerson, then a senior policy adviser to President George W. Bush, walked through the massive campus, they came to the dining hall, where they saw a mural of Jesus surrounded by a group of children. The sisters told them that the mural featured portraits of children who had died of HIV at the orphanage, and that the children came there to talk to and play with their friends on the wall.

The epidemic was hardly confined to Ethiopia. It was ravaging sub-Saharan Africa. Two-thirds of the 40 million people in the world infected with HIV lived in that region. More than 12 million children had been orphaned by AIDS.

“We really are in a national crisis,” the president of Botswana, Festus Mogae, said in 2000. “We are threatened with extinction. People are dying in chillingly high numbers. We are losing the best of young people. It is a crisis of the first magnitude.”

In parts of Botswana, 75 percent of pregnant women had HIV. Most diseases kill the very old and the very young, “but this disease was killing the most productive and reproductive parts of society,” Dybul recalled in 2018. “So not only were many households run by orphans, but entire villages were run by orphans, because everyone else was dead.”

Then came PEPFAR.

The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, first authorized by Bush in 2003, was the largest commitment made by any nation to address a single disease. It was, the president said, “a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of Africa.” PEPFAR, which received strong bipartisan support, is credited with saving 26 million lives and enabling almost 8 million babies to be born without HIV. It transformed the landscape of the HIV epidemic and helped stabilize the African continent. Not only is PEPFAR the single most successful policy to date in U.S.-Africa relations; it is “also one of the most successful foreign policy programs in U.S. history,” as Belinda Archibong, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote last year.

During his 2006 trip to Ethiopia, Dybul visited a rural village near Axum. “At dawn, with the mist over the town, it looked as it might have centuries ago,” Dybul told me. “Local farmers winding through the streets with donkey-drawn wagons, the spires of the churches peeking through the haze, bells ringing to call all to prayers and the market. At a visit to the local clinic, the director—who was also a town elder and leader in the community—kept referring to PEPFAR. I asked him what PEPFAR means. His answer knocked me over. ‘PEPFAR means the American people care about us.'”

John Robert Engole arrived at a clinic run by Reach Out Mbuya, a faith-based NGO, in the suburbs of Kampala, Uganda, in 2004. He was very weak, having contracted severe tuberculosis, and his immune system was collapsing. He was suffering from late-stage HIV. But as Esther Nakkazi wrote in Harvard Public Health, Engole became the first person treated as a result of PEPFAR. “The dying stopped after PEPFAR,” Margrethe Juncker, a Danish doctor who cared for urban slum dwellers living with HIV/AIDS in Uganda and who treated Engole, told Nakkazi. She called the program a “miracle.”

Then came Donald Trump.

On the first day of his second term, Trump issued Executive Order 14169, calling for a 90-day pause on all foreign-development and assistance programs pending further review. A subsequent stop-work order froze payments and work already under way, hobbling programs worldwide. The administration dissolved USAID, the main U.S. organization that provides humanitarian aid and the primary implementing agency for PEPFAR.

The stop-work order initially froze all PEPFAR programming and services, halting work in the field, including the provision of antiretroviral therapy. And although PEPFAR—which accounts for 0.08 percent of the federal budget and has been consistently judged to be a highly effective and accountable program—received a limited waiver in February allowing it to continue “life-saving HIV services,” the actual implementation of that waiver has been delayed, fragmented, and chaotic. Supply chains have been disrupted; so have diagnostic and treatment services. There have been mass layoffs of staff. Clinics have been shut down. “The result was unprecedented operational chaos, funding lapses, the collapse of implementation partnerships, and, in many cases, clinic closures,” according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Those on the ground report widespread disruption of HIV services and devastating consequences for PEPFAR beneficiaries; the infrastructure that took years to build has been decimated. That will remain true even if the Trump administration were to reactivate PEPFAR tomorrow.

More than 75,000 adults and children are now estimated to have died because of the effective shutdown of PEPFAR that began less than six months ago. Another adult life is being lost every three minutes; a child dies every 31 minutes. Ending PEPFAR could result in as many as 11 million additional new HIV infections and nearly 3 million additional AIDS-related deaths by the end of the decade.

O

nce PEPFAR was announced, a number of evangelical groups and individuals played an important role in supporting it. They understood their faith to call them to care for the sick and the poor, to advocate for the oppressed, and to demonstrate their commitment to the sanctity of life. But as this human catastrophe unfolds, few American evangelical pastors, churches, denominations, or para-church organizations have spoken out against the destruction of PEPFAR. Nor, from what I can tell, do they seem inclined to do so.

Why have so many evangelicals remained silent? Is it mostly explained by ignorance or indifference? Compassion fatigue? Or perhaps fealty to Trump? Is the silence among ministers explained by fear of upsetting congregants? A desire to keep their ministry separate from politics? Other ministry commitments? I put these questions to more than two dozen individuals, mostly pastors, past and present, some of whom were willing to speak on the record and others who requested anonymity in order to speak candidly. The story they tell is a complicated one.

Peter Wehner: The evangelical church is breaking apart

Several said that most Christians, and most pastors, simply aren't aware of PEPFAR. “It's done extraordinary good, and yet it's virtually invisible to most,” James Forsyth, of Cedar Springs Presbyterian Church in Knoxville, Tennessee, told me. “That's a huge part of the problem. Think about walking along the pew in the average congregation, or down the street in the average town: My bet is that the vast majority of people couldn't tell you what PEPFAR is, what it's achieved, that it's under threat, or why that matters.”

Chris Davis, of Groveton Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, and a strong supporter of PEPFAR, told me that for many, the issue seems distant. “Very few evangelicals have walked down Coffin Row in Malawi or know anyone who has,” he said. (Prior to PEPFAR, so many carpenters switched to making coffins in Lilongwe, the capital of Malawi, that their workshops along Kenyatta Drive acquired a new, macabre name.) “So it can be much more theoretical than personal when this is not addressing an issue that your friend, neighbor, or even extended family member is facing, like, cancer or type 2 diabetes.”

A lot of churches really are caring for “the least of these,” to use a phrase from Jesus, and braiding their faith with a social conscience. But they do so on issues other than PEPFAR.

Scott Dudley, of Bellevue Presbyterian Church in Bellevue, Washington, believes the destruction of PEPFAR is a tragedy, but his church is preoccupied with other unfolding changes. “The main reason we haven't addressed PEPFAR,” he told me, “is because we are more involved with issues around refugees, asylum seekers, and immigration. Our partners in this are Christian nonprofits who lost huge amounts of money in the cuts to USAID.” Congregants, he said, risk being overwhelmed and exhausted, and so he encourages them to focus on the arenas in which they are already most involved. Another person who was involved in church ministry put it to me this way: “We are finite creatures, each called to particular causes. The Church should respond to injustice, but it can't respond to every injustice all the time.”

Some ministers, instead, cited an aversion to becoming involved in politics, especially politics that might roil a congregation. Many Christians believe that church is meant for worship, not for guidance on policy, even on pressing humanitarian issues. One person told me that the pastor's responsibility is “to preach the word in season and out and pray that his people grow in Christ enough to change the world in their spheres of influence. On extremely rare occasions—i.e., declaring war on another country—it might be right to preach from the pulpit about an overtly political cause. But in general I think it will only polarize and fragment the church further.”

A principled aversion to politicizing the pulpit was sometimes difficult to distinguish from a very human fear of speaking out on issues that might trigger an angry response from Trump supporters in the pews. Even pastors whose moral conscience might make them inclined to speak out against the decimation of PEPFAR think twice about doing so, because they don't want to become the target of attacks by members of their own congregation. One conservative-leaning pastor confided to me, “Sometimes I wish I weren't a pastor so I could speak up more loudly and more clearly.”

A pastor in the Presbyterian Church in America—a conservative denomination—put it to me this way: “There are pastors who act like gatekeepers and spend an inordinate amount of time publicly shaming those whom they politically disagree with on social media, putting pressure on them to respond or even call for resignations.” He worried that the attacks would distract him from his responsibilities to his local congregation. “I wonder what public statements would even accomplish in such a polarized environment, other than to bring grief on my family and church,” he said.

He's hardly alone. “Any pastor who has ever ventured to speak out on a controversial ‘political' issue, whether it's a moral issue or not, knows that he will get tremendous, angry feedback from some of his people,” a man who had pastored an influential evangelical church in Northern Virginia told me. “This causes him to hesitate. He wonders if addressing this issue to his little flock will really be helpful to anyone.” (This individual told me that if he were still pastoring his church, he hopes he would speak out, even if he would do so reluctantly, because “a pastor must also warn his sheep of the dangers around them.”)

Some people in the Christian relief and development community are remaining silent because the administration has proved both capricious and volatile. They still hope to change its course but fear that public criticism could lead it to dig in. Others pointed to the deep distrust of government that runs through many conservative churches. Since the evangelical move into right-wing politics in the late 1970s, one pastor told me, evangelicals have held as axiomatic the words of Ronald Reagan in his 1981 inaugural address: “Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” His church supports medical missionaries and nonprofits that work on health issues overseas, but that doesn't necessarily translate to support for PEPFAR. “There is a general suspicion of government programs and an assumption that anything run by the government is characterized by inefficiencies and graft,” he told me. “So the slashing of governmental programs rarely causes an outcry among evangelicals.”

A person who was once involved in ministry described the mindset this way: “The government shouldn't be doing this. Even if PEPFAR is a great program and saves millions of lives, it's not the role of the U.S. government to spend the money obtained from the forcible confiscation of citizens' property for the benefit of non-Americans. Reduce taxes, highlight the issue, and encourage Americans to set up and charitably give to NGOs that perform the same function.”

A minister in a church in Memphis told me it's important to “recall that most evangelicals also originally viewed the HIV/AIDS issue as a result of sexual promiscuity, and gay promiscuity especially. So I suspect too many of them regard the HIV/AIDS crisis as a self-inflicted contagion. I can imagine the moralists saying, ‘They brought this on themselves. It's God's judgment on them for their sexual sin. And they shouldn't expect me to pay for their meds.'”

Some of the opposition has very different roots. Tim Dearborn helped lead World Vision—an interdenominational Christian humanitarian aid, development, and advocacy organization—during the years PEPFAR was introduced. World Vision, along with the National Association of Evangelicals; Samaritan's Purse; a handful of other Christian groups; the rock star Bono, who in 2004 co-founded the ONE Campaign, an advocacy organization focused on fighting extreme poverty and preventable diseases, particularly in Africa; and the preacher Rick Warren and his wife, Kay, co-founders of Saddleback Church, worked tirelessly to convince evangelicals that AIDS was an issue about which they should care. But World Vision also encountered pushback. “The judgment that it was either a gay disease or the result of extramarital promiscuity fed evangelicals' resistance and disinterest,” Dearborn told me. Despite its efforts to focus evangelicals on saving millions in Africa from dying of AIDS, World Vision had difficulty making inroads. “It's never been a priority, even though women and children are often innocent victims who suffer and die from the disease,” he said.

Ken Casey worked at World Vision for more than 20 years. From 2001 to 2007, he led its global response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. He pointed to more theological explanations. “Evangelicals tend to prioritize getting people to make a (one-time) decision to have faith in Jesus without giving sufficient attention to following Jesus' commands to love God and our neighbors,” he told me in an email.

So there are plenty of explanations for why evangelicals have not spoken out against what is happening to PEPFAR, some of them far more understandable than others. But it's still hard to ignore this fact: White evangelicals voted in overwhelming numbers to put into office a president who has, for now, decimated a program that qualifies as among the greatest health interventions in the history of medicine and one of the most humanitarian acts in the history of America. Millions may die as a result. And a religious movement that proudly advertises itself as pro-life, and which over the years has taken public stands on issues including abortion, same-sex marriage, pornography, critical race theory, the role of women in combat, school curriculum, and sports betting and gambling in all forms, has, with rare exceptions, said nothing about it.

A pastor of a conservative evangelical church told me he's grieved by this. “I got exhausted by the sympathetic inaction,” he told me. “If a Democratic administration were doing this—callously, illegally, and completely unnecessarily destroying a cause prayed for, advocated for, designed by, and in many cases carried out by evangelical believers—I struggle to believe that the response would be any less immediate and strident than if they were to mandate states to permit abortion.” He added, “The gleeful destruction of USAID and careless discarding of lives, and the associated lies, are such obvious crossings of red lines, such blatant violations of a basic Christian posture in the world, that acting as though they are politics as usual actively deceives and disempowers our people, and we will have to deal with the cost of inaction as the projections become historical fact.”

Mark Labberton, the former president of Fuller Theological Seminary, has found in his work that many white pastors around the country see far fewer red lines in this moment than do pastors serving communities of color. “White churches and congregations seem tone-deaf to the raw pain and suffering so many are experiencing,” he told me. “When the social location of our gospel allows us to not see, to not hear, or to not care for vulnerable people, we fail the way of Jesus.” What gospel, he asked, are we prepared to live?

When Labberton became a Christian in the 1970s, he realized that his new faith wasn't meant to be merely an add-on to his life, but instead, a faith that should reframe everything. That vision—in which hearts of flesh would replace hearts of stone, in the words of Ezekiel—seems at odds with the reaction of the evangelical world to the end of PEPFAR.

That PEPFAR should appeal to pro-life Christians feels like an obvious truth to those who know what it has accomplished. The award-winning Christian singer-songwriter Amy Grant performed last month along with fellow evangelical musicians at a church in Brentwood, Tennessee, to raise awareness of and support for PEPFAR. “I look at the conservative faith community and the word pro-life is said many times, and I go, ‘Whoa, there's not much more of a pro-life effort than combatting HIV/AIDS worldwide,'” Grant said.

She was joined by Russell Moore, the editor in chief of Christianity Today. “PEPFAR should be an easy call for evangelical Christians,” Moore told me. “It affirms human dignity and the sanctity of life in ways easily within the reach and responsibility of our country. It is hard to know whether the glee for destroying one of the most effective and successful moral reforms American evangelicals have ever supported is more sadism, cruelty for cruelty's sake, or masochism.”

President Bush, himself a Christian and self-described “compassionate conservative” who in 2003 explained that the moral foundation for PEPFAR was the belief that “everybody has worth, everybody matters, everybody was created by the Almighty,” put it this way a few days ago in a video praising the outgoing staff of USAID: “Is it in our interest that 25 million people who would have died now live? I think it is.”

“My longing is that my fellow evangelicals would sit down with the sheer, disproportionate statistics of the closing of PEPFAR,” Chris Davis of Groveton Baptist told me. “The cost is a minuscule sliver of federal spending that has saved more than 25 million lives to date. The lives that could be lost by shuttering the program exceeds the amount of lives lost to abortion each year in our country. If we could end abortion deaths in America for 0.08 percent of the federal budget, evangelicals would support it in a heartbeat.”

Davis is grieved by the sheer cruelty of abandoning PEPFAR. “It does almost nothing to address our national debt, it does nothing to transfer these lifesaving programs to other funding sources, and costs a potential of millions of lives per year,” he said. “To what end? For what great cause? This is the exact disregard for human life that animates our anger against abortion. So why are we not furious at this catastrophic loss of life?”

Answering that piercing question requires understanding the cultural politics that have shaped American evangelicalism over the past half century. There is a “cultural lens that people have that sits atop evangelical theology,” Michael Keller, a pastor at Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, told me. It's not the theology that explains the silence on PEPFAR; it's “the cultural lens we're using to parse how we engage,” according to Keller.

The problem is that in too many cases, that cultural lens has very little to do with the priorities of Jesus. People who have become “culture warriors” in the name of Jesus often validate their cultural politics by proof-texting the Bible. But proof-texting the Bible can lead to some very bad places, as we've seen throughout Christian history, when verses from the Bible were used to justify everything from genocide to wars, from anti-Semitism to slavery and segregation, from geo-centrism to attacks on evolution. In Luke 4, we're told that Satan used the Bible—Psalm 91—to tempt Jesus, in what is surely the most prominent of the great proof-texting wars.

In 2014, World Vision announced that it was willing to hire Christians in same-sex marriages in the United States. The reaction was instantaneous, overwhelming, and ferocious. Prominent evangelicals and organizations denounced the Christian humanitarian organization for deviating from traditional Christian values. The charity lost more than 3,000 sponsors for needy children. Evangelical groups across the country called for a boycott. Prominent evangelicals such as Franklin Graham and Al Mohler attacked World Vision; Mohler referred to its decision as “a grave and tragic act.” Evangelical scholars called it a “betrayal.” The extraordinary humanitarian work of World Vision didn't seem to matter; prosecuting the culture war did, even if innocent children were the collateral damage. Within two days, World Vision reversed its decision.

It's a revealing comparison: A decision by a venerated Christian relief agency to hire Christians in same-sex relationships caused an immediate, angry, and explosive reaction across the evangelical world, while the decision to effectively end a program that has saved more than 25 million lives on the African continent barely registers. Few of those who are aware of what's happening have anything to say about it. And many who are inclined to say something pull back, fearful of the consequences.

Because of the brazen cruelty of the Trump administration, we can expect there to be new murals of Jesus surrounded by children who died of AIDS in Ethiopia, new “Coffin Rows” in countries like Malawi, and fewer miracles like the one that saved the life of John Robert Engole. Evangelicals in America—for a dozen different reasons—have mostly turned their eyes away from what is happening on the African continent. They have other things to do. They have culture wars to fight.

Jesus knew such people in his time. They were religious figures who, when they saw that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho, passed to the other side.

The health secretary's approach to the condition gives the impression that two decades of research simply never happened.

The annual meeting of the International Society for Autism Research is the closest autism science gets to having an Oscars moment of its own. When 2,200 experts from more than 50 countries meet up in one place—as they did this spring in Seattle—a kind of brainy excitement pervades, not just because of the awards given out (yes, awards are given out) or the chance for up-and-comers to network with top names in autism research, but also because there's always something to celebrate in the science itself. For two decades, studies presented at INSAR have shaped the world's understanding of autism. The buzz at the conference comes from the conviction that the work matters and that progress continues, sustained by an optimism that no nonscientist could undo.

With one possible exception: U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

In April, shortly before the conference, Kennedy announced a major research undertaking. He promised that his agency would determine the cause of autism—or, at least, have “some of the answers”—by September. (He soon extended the timeline into next year.) The effort, he pledged, would employ “the most credible scientists from all over the world.”

Now here those scientists were, all in one place. But none of those we spoke with had received the call to help, nor did they expect to. In speeches and interviews as health secretary, Kennedy has made clear his disdain for mainstream autism research, brushing aside the insights gained for this tremendously complex condition through years of research. Instead, backed by the enormous power of his federal office, Kennedy now appears determined to pursue his own long-held set of theories about autism: first, that we are in the midst of an autism epidemic (which is, in fact, highly debatable); second, that autism is caused by one or more “environmental toxins” (which incorrectly suggests that environmental factors have not been explored); and third, that powerful interests want this information covered up (a conspiracy-esque viewpoint that lacks evidence).

“The way the secretary characterizes autism research,” David Amaral, the research director at the MIND Institute at UC Davis and one of INSAR's co-founders, told us, “it's as if nobody's been doing anything for the last 30 years.” Amaral was one of more than a dozen veteran researchers we met with over the four-day conference, whose faces all went dark anytime we asked about the impact of Kennedy's muscling into their domain. They have been witnessing the health secretary bend the narrative of autism science in America. Their shared assessment: What he's doing is not good.

The problem begins, in the researchers' view, with Kennedy's grasp of the science, which they say he either doesn't understand or refuses to acknowledge. For instance, Kennedy has complained that too much money has been spent studying genetic causes of autism, describing this avenue as “a dead end.” Between sessions at the conference, the geneticist Joseph Buxbaum sat with us in an empty meeting room and sketched out on a piece of cardboard the numbers and timeline that demonstrate all that's wrong with this viewpoint. Autism's genetic underpinnings were first uncovered through studies of twins in the 1970s. Access to the human genome has now revealed that about 80 percent of the odds of being autistic are rooted in heritability. At INSAR this year, one of the most optimistic presentations focused on the progress being made toward genetics-based treatments. “It is shocking,” Buxbaum said of Kennedy's apparent disregard for experts' input.

Compounding the situation are the Trump administration's blitz of DEI-focused executive orders and DOGE cuts, which are undermining autism research. The Autism Science Foundation has been circulating a questionnaire asking researchers to report funding lost this year. Dozens of responses have been received, so far adding up to more than $80 million worth of halted research and pending grants that now will not come through. Jobs have been lost. Future discoveries have been postponed, possibly for good.

Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for HHS, told us in an email that Kennedy's team is “fully committed to leaving no stone unturned in confronting this catastrophic epidemic—employing only gold-standard, evidence-based science.” It's unclear just whom Kennedy is relying on for scientific expertise; Hilliard did not address a request for more information about the scientists involved in the health secretary's initiatives. But Kennedy's singular view on the actual expert consensus seems driven by a personal goal: to implicate vaccines as the cause of autism. He now has reshuffled the ranks of the CDC's vaccine-advisory committee to include scientists who lack expertise on vaccines and have shared anti-vaccine views, and he has reportedly appointed the son and frequent collaborator of an anti-vaccine activist—one who long promoted false ties between vaccines and autism—to begin examining federal databases for evidence of such a link.

Kennedy has long been a prominent advocate of this false conviction. A quarter century ago, the now-discredited British researcher Andrew Wakefield claimed to have discovered a temporal association between administration of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and the onset of autistic symptoms in young children. Thus began a self-perpetuating cycle. The greater the number of parents who decided to refuse the MMR vaccine, the more the news media saw a valid trend story. Only four months after Wakefield published in The Lancet, MMR vaccinations had dropped almost 14 percent in South Wales. The fear soon crossed the Atlantic, and Kennedy himself brought further mainstream attention to the issue in “Deadly Immunity,” a 2005 article for Rolling Stone and Salon. (Both publications later retracted the story.) Books were written about the supposed danger. Documentaries were made. Protests were held.

It's hard to remember now, but up until that time, most people had never heard of autism. Almost overnight, parents everywhere became scared of the word, and scared of what a doctor's needle might mean for their child. This fear had obvious downsides—the stigmatization of autistic people as being “damaged,” a drop in vaccine uptake broadly, a loss of faith in science, and a sense that something dangerous had been let loose upon the population and especially children. But something constructive came from all the attention to the issue as well. Parent activists jumped on it to pressure Congress to start funding autism research. The money began flowing in earnest in 2006, with a five-year $945 million allocation, and has since reached a total so far of roughly $5 billion, funding university labs and research centers around the U.S. The investment paid off: Autism became better understood. The vaccine question was a top priority out of the gate, and epidemiological research found repeatedly, exhaustively, and emphatically that vaccines do not cause autism.

Clearly, however, RFK Jr. is not satisfied.

When Kennedy speaks today about autism, it's as though the past 20 years never happened. It's not just about the canard that is being resuscitated. It's the language he uses to talk about what he thinks being autistic means. At a press conference in April, he set off a firestorm in autism communities when he described children with autism as “kids who will never pay taxes. They'll never hold a job; they'll never play baseball; they'll never write a poem; they'll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”

Tragedy framing, sorrow inducing—this echoes the 20th-century take on autism, when people with the diagnosis were too often treated as not fully human. Many were subjected to abuse and isolation (often by being institutionalized). After Kennedy received some blowback for his comments, he clarified that he was talking specifically about children on the severest end of the spectrum. Hilliard, the HHS spokesperson, told us that Kennedy “remains committed to working toward a society where people with autism have access to meaningful opportunities, appropriate supports and the full respect and recognition they deserve.” She said his statements aimed to emphasize “the need for increased research into environmental factors contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses, not to stigmatize individuals with autism or their families.”

Nevertheless, the damage was done. Regardless of his intention, the ways Kennedy speaks about autism seem to miss how, for many, the prevailing narrative has moved on to more human framing, in which autism is not a disease or a tragedy but a difference meriting acceptance and support. His bleak terminology—autism is “a disease”; it “destroys families”; “we need to put an end to it”—has left a mark. Amy Gravino, who is autistic and specializes in sexuality and relationship coaching, told us she felt shattered by Kennedy's comments. “For the last 20 years, we as a community have fought against the rhetoric that RFK is now spouting,” she said. “Everything we have tried to do to humanize autistic people has been potentially wiped away in one fell swoop.”

Many parents, too, took offense at RFK's flattened portrait of their autistic children as a collection of problems and nothing more. The depiction leaves out everything about these children's worth as people: their capacity for joy, love, and creativity; their inherent dignity. “If the world uses a lens that is only based on deficits and struggle rather than the complexity and nuance that is a part of any human being, including and especially autistic people, that makes true belonging really hard,” Sara Swoboda, a pediatrician in Boise, Idaho, whose daughter has an autism diagnosis, told us over email.

At the INSAR conference, a pediatrician alerted us to concerns spreading among parents about Kennedy's plans to create a “data platform” for autism. So far, the National Institutes of Health, the agency overseeing the platform, has outlined this project only vaguely, including that it would involve scraping data from all over the digital landscape—from Medicaid claims, private-sector health records, pharmacy chains, insurance billings, and even smartwatches and fitness trackers. It has not gone over well. The pediatrician shared some of the texts she has been getting from contacts around the country reporting that parents of autistic children were calling their health-care providers and pleading with them to scrub references to autism from their kids' medical records. Other parents waiting for assessments for autism were calling in to cancel.

When we contacted nearly a dozen doctors and advocates about this matter, they confirmed getting similar requests from parents in their practices and communities. “People are freaking out, and I don't blame them,” Alycia Halladay, the chief science officer for the Autism Science Foundation, told us. “For the government to come in with no transparency and say we have the authority to take this data, that is scary to people.” They're scared of lost privacy, of seeing their kids stigmatized, of consequences related to insurance and job discrimination. But in a bigger sense, they don't want their kids marked, and scared of a comeback for those old attitudes about autism.

Data collection in itself need not be a source of panic. It is, after all, the currency of epidemiology. It's how the vaccine theory was debunked and how the CDC determines prevalence rates. Usually, methods are put in place to ensure anonymity and ethical disbursement of the data. Hilliard told us that “all NIH-managed databases follow the highest standards of security and privacy, with the protection of personal health information as a top priority.” Even if there's nothing to fear about this new database, however, good results in science depend on trust. That trust now appears to be at risk.



Not everyone thinks Kennedy is getting every part of the story wrong. His clumsily calibrated messaging, though offensive to many, was appreciated by some families who feel seen by the secretary for addressing a segment of the autistic population that still gets minimal attention. These are people whose challenges range from moderate to severe and who, as Kennedy acknowledges, will never achieve real independence. The most challenged—assessed at roughly 27 percent of the autistic population in a 2023 study—are people with IQs below 50 or whose ability in the use of spoken language is minimal to none. Some in this group can also be violent toward themselves, and their inability to understand danger has resulted in their deaths with shocking frequency. They are people who require round-the-clock supervision,

Especially for the families of such individuals, there is a deep frustration that most people no longer associate autism with individuals like their kids. Theirs is not the popular autism story. They get little interest from Hollywood, which best likes narratives about autistic people as fundamentally quirky or brilliant. Science hasn't shown much interest either, especially social science, whose practitioners find it easier to study people who can hold a conversation and complete a questionnaire. Additionally, parents who risk sharing details of the struggles at home can end up feeling like they've violated some sort of taboo, facing social-media pile-ons in which they're accused of dehumanizing their children by being explicit about autism's downsides.

Kennedy was explicit about the downsides. In response, Amy Lutz, a medical historian and the vice president of the National Council on Severe Autism, wrote an article titled “RFK Was Right: Severe Autism Can Be Devastating.” Lutz is the mother of an adult autistic man. She argues that Kennedy definitely gets a lot wrong about autism (for example, vaccines), but at least he is “shining a light on the segment of the autism spectrum that has been increasingly marginalized by a focus on the most capable.”

During our last full day at INSAR, we attended a luncheon sponsored by an advocacy organization called Profound Autism Alliance. Seated around three long tables was a group of psychiatrists, psychologists, pediatricians, and educators all involved in serving the marginalized 27 percent. That morning, they had witnessed a milestone in their field: A presentation at the conference had called for formal recognition and definition of profound autism as a new diagnostic category. (How widely this framing will gain acceptance remains to be seen.) Kennedy had no involvement in the presentation, but we asked the group about the health secretary's role in bringing attention to the profoundly autistic. There was, at best, some grudging acknowledgment that he had done so. But the researchers—whom we agreed not to name so they could speak without fear of professional repercussions—were much more concerned about the harm they feared Kennedy is doing, and will do, by parachuting, uninvited, into their realm. The risk, they said, is not just the harm to science, or potentially to their own work or the careers of those just starting out who may now choose something “not autism” to work on. All of that, they told us, is secondary to the potential harm to autistic people and to those who know and love them.

If faulty science takes charge and finds a cause that isn't a cause—such as vaccines—it will imply that the easy next step is finding the antidote to the cause. That is a seriously problematic proposition. For one thing, many diagnosed people say they have no interest in becoming unautistic. For another, a one-and-done remedy for the condition's most debilitating manifestations is, quite simply, a phantom goal. As anyone who has seriously studied autism will tell you, the condition is too complex. As one pediatric neurologist at the profound-autism luncheon put it, “If I had that magic pill, don't you think I would give it to you?” There is no magic in science, which is why so many researchers think Kennedy's approach is an exercise in false hope. One thing the neurologist knows after years of treating children herself, she told us, is “there's nothing worse for a family than to be given false hope.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Culture and entertainment musts from Ashley Parker

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Welcome back to The Daily's Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer or editor reveals what's keeping them entertained. Today's special guest is Ashley Parker, a staff writer who has covered the decline and fall of Elon Musk, interviewed President Donald Trump for The Atlantic's June cover story, and written about miscarriage and motherhood.

Ashley is a fan of anything by Ann Patchett, recommends watching The Studio for a comedy break, and considers Wonder Boys the rare movie that surpasses the book.

The Culture Survey: Ashley Parker

An author I will read anything by: Ann Patchett. I came to her late, and the first book I read was Bel Canto, but then I was hooked. I went back and read everything else she'd written, and I now read everything she writes, as soon as it comes out. My dirty secret is that I'm basically a modern-fiction speed-reader and very little I read stays with me, but Patchett has a way of creating entire worlds and characters that linger. (I actually met her at the Martha's Vineyard Book Festival a few years ago, when we were both panelists, though it was far more exciting for me than it was for her, alas.) For literary mysteries, I am also obsessed with Tana French, and because I have to wait for each new book to come out, I have since discovered the Maeve Kerrigan series, by Jane Casey.

The television show I'm most enjoying right now: My husband and I just binged The Survivors in a single night—me because I found it addictive, and him because he claims he wanted to “get it over with.” We've since moved on to The Studio with Seth Rogen, which is consistently funny and well done.

My favorite art movie: Wonder Boys. And this is not a question you asked, but I'm going to offer up anyhow that this is the rare—perhaps only!—instance where the movie is better than the book. (No offense, Michael Chabon.) It's got an amazing cast (Michael Douglas, Robert Downey Jr., Frances McDormand, plus Katie Holmes in red cowboy boots) and an age-appropriate, middle-age romance. Enough said.

An actor I would watch in anything: Michael Cera and Jesse Eisenberg—their essences are somehow endearingly familiar to me. Specifically: They both remind me of my dorky high-school guy friends, and I've always loved the movies they end up choosing. I recently watched Eisenberg's A Real Pain, which did not disappoint. And though I feel like I'm familiar even with Cera's more obscure work (see: Paper Heart), my all-time-favorite movie of his is probably Juno.

Best work of nonfiction I've recently read: Invisible Child, by Andrea Elliott. On principle, I read almost zero nonfiction unless I have to for work, but I loved her series of stories for The New York Times on Dasani Coates, a young girl who comes of age in Brooklyn's homeless shelters. The book is similarly cinematic, and absolutely gripping.

Also, for work—because I am interviewing the authors (separately) at Politics and Prose this month—I just read Empire of the Elite, by Michael Grynbaum, and 2024, by Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf. They are very different books: Grynbaum's is an inside look at the golden years of Condé Nast and how it shaped our culture, and 2024 is an inside account of Donald Trump's, Joe Biden's, and Kamala Harris's 2024 campaigns. But they're both engaging, fantastic reads, and I'm glad I had an excuse to get early copies and violate my no-nonfiction rule.

And on the topic of campaign books: I am wildly biased, but I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention my husband's 2020-Trump-campaign book, Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost, which I read a bajillion times—chapter by chapter, often out of order—as he was writing it. It remains the best Trump-campaign book I've read, in part because, in addition to having a slew of scoops, it explains the Trump phenomenon and what motivates the MAGA base, including Trump's now-famous “Front Row Joe” uber-loyalists.

A musical artist who means a lot to me: Billy Joel. Long story, but the first cassette tape I ever discovered was my dad's copy of Billy Joel's Greatest Hits—Volume I & Volume II, and for a year or two in elementary school, I absolutely refused to listen to anything else—or to allow my family to listen to anything else.

The last museum or gallery show that I loved: Yayoi Kusama's “Infinity Mirrors,” when it came to the Hirshhorn a few years ago. I like that she's basically a hipster nonagenarian, and that her work is very accessible and fun, because I'm a philistine. Visiting the exhibit was also one of the first dates my now-husband and I went on, and on our honeymoon in Japan, we ended up seeing more of her work, so her show has a nice full-circle quality for me.

Something I recently revisited: I keep meaning to reread The Secret History, by Donna Tartt, which my first boss, Maureen Dowd, introduced to me one day in an airport bookstore and correctly predicted that I'd love.

A favorite story I've read in The Atlantic: I will read anything by Caitlin Flanagan; in fact, she is the reason I finally subscribed to The Atlantic several years ago. But the specific article that still stays with me, now more than a decade later, is Scott Stossel's “Surviving Anxiety.” The writing is so vivid and honest, and as someone who has dealt with various phobias of my own, I found it imminently relatable.

Something delightful introduced to me by a kid in my life: Kuk Sool Won, a Korean form of martial arts that my 6-year-old is currently obsessed with. We discovered it randomly, when I signed her up for a Kuk Sool after-care club, and she instantly fell in love. She is now a yellow-striped belt and takes it so seriously. Nothing brings me more joy than watching her bark out Korean words I don't understand and practice her various “forms,” her mouth set in a line of grim determination.

A poem, or line of poetry, that I return to: These words, from Joan Didion's The Year of Magical Thinking, aren't technically poetry, but they might as well be. Now that I'm a mom and in my 40s, I find them regularly drifting through my thoughts, unbidden:

“Life changes in the instant. The ordinary instant.”

Here are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic:

The Week Ahead

Essay

The Christian Rocker at the Center of MAGA

By Ali Breland

After wildfires erupted in Los Angeles County earlier this year, a team from the Department of Housing and Urban Development descended on the wreckage. Led by HUD Secretary Scott Turner, the entourage walked through the rubble in Altadena, reassuring victims that the Trump administration had their back. At Turner's request, a Christian-nationalist musician named Sean Feucht tagged along. “I can't overemphasize how amazing this opportunity is,” Feucht had posted on Instagram the day before. “I'm bringing my guitar. We're going to worship. We're going to pray.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Trump's Only-Okay Economy","https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/07/trumps-only-okay-economy/683421/","Sun, 06 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

He hasn't crashed it, but he hasn't made it great either. That's a problem.

If you've been listening to Donald Trump and his critics over the past six months, they have found one thing they can agree on: Trump's presidency would have a dramatic impact on the U.S. economy. Elected in part because of voters' anger over high prices, Trump promised that he would “immediately bring prices down, starting on Day One.” He said that his deregulatory policies would encourage domestic oil producers to “drill, baby, drill,” and that lower energy prices would “bring down” the “prices of everything.” His tariffs, he said, would make the United States “rich as hell,” and “bring our country's businesses back that left us,” boosting investment and employment. And his campaign of deporting undocumented immigrants would, he claimed, cut the price of housing and create new job opportunities for native-born Americans. A statement from the White House on the day Trump was inaugurated summed up his hyperbolic vision of future prosperity: “This will truly be the golden age of America.”

The rhetoric of Trump's critics, particularly following his imposition of outrageously high global tariff rates on what he called “Liberation Day,” has matched his hyperbole—in the opposite direction. Trump's tariffs were going to lead to “inevitable disaster” and “an economic catastrophe.” They were upending the global trading order and causing “an economic emergency.”

Five months into Trump's presidency, though, something interesting has happened: nothing much. The economy has changed remarkably little. Unemployment is at 4.2 percent, right around where it's been for the past year. Inflation has fallen mildly since Trump took office, but at 2.4 percent, it's exactly where it was last September. The economy did shrink slightly in the first quarter of this year, but estimates suggest that it grew at an annualized rate of about 2.5 percent in the second quarter, which would put aggregate growth for the first half of the year in the 1 to 2 percent range, forecast to even out at roughly 1.4 percent for the year. That's slower than last year's 2.8 percent GDP-growth rate, but again, not a radical shift. Real wages and household income are both up year on year, at a slightly slower clip. And although the stock market has seen some sharp gyrations—booming over the past two months, after its post–Liberation Day plunge—it is now posting a modest rise of a little more than 1 percent since Inauguration Day.

In sum, the U.S. economy today looks pretty much like the one we had before Trump took over. He has brought more uncertainty and generated less trade—Trump's tariffs, and other countries' response to them, have reduced U.S. imports and exports—but the differences are not that dramatic. The economy as a whole is growing more slowly than it did last year, but seems to be chugging along at an adequate pace. Things are neither great nor terrible. The Trump economy is just okay—in large part because, in the short term, American businesses and consumers have simply kept doing what they were doing, even in the face of enormous uncertainty.

David A. Graham: The TACO presidency

One reason why Trump's reelection has made so little difference is that his promises of ushering in a golden age never made much sense. The room for juicing the economy with a “drill, baby, drill” policy was strictly limited: U.S. energy production was already at an all-time high in 2024, and the price of oil can only drop so far before American fracking becomes unprofitable—which would reduce production and send oil prices back up. Although energy prices do matter to the economy, they're far from the only driver—and Trump's pledge to lower prices generally was always a fantasy. Presidents have little control over prices, which in any case almost never fall except during a recession. And Trump's favorite policies—imposing tariffs and deporting undocumented immigrants—would be expected to drive prices up, not down. As for the rest of Trump's economic agenda—extending his 2017 tax cuts, making various deregulatory moves, and cutting disfavored government programs such as USAID—none of it is likely to move the economic needle in any major way.

But if no golden age, why no catastrophe either? Trump's tariff policies have not resulted in the economic disaster that so many pundits—myself included—expected, for the relatively straightforward reason that Trump backed off on his exorbitant rates on most of the world almost immediately. (He rolled most of them back to the universal 10 percent rate that he's always wanted to charge.) He did keep a trade war with China going for almost six weeks but eventually moderated on that too, settling for a 30 percent increase on existing tariffs with China (down from his peak proclaimed rate of 145 percent). That trade barrier is not trivial—especially for American businesses that are dependent on Chinese imports—but it's also not big enough to crash the U.S. economy.

Whether the Trump economy will stay okay is harder to divine, given that economic policy in this administration is determined by his whim. The Liberation Day tariff pause is scheduled to expire on Tuesday, which was supposedly the deadline for concluding 90 trade deals in 90 days (so far a grand total of two have been agreed, and one other “framework” has been announced), and Trump has made noises about potentially reverting back to the original sky-high tariffs for some countries. That would certainly be bad for the economy. But Trump has also suggested that he might merely extend the pause. So we could end up just muddling through.

James Surowiecki: Wall Street blew it

The administration is cranking up its sales pitch on the budget bill now before Congress, arguing that it will “supercharge” the economy. Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, for instance, recently issued a report claiming that the bill—which will extend the 2017 tax cuts, eliminate most taxes on overtime and tips, and change accounting rules for business investment to make it easier for companies to write off investments—will boost economic growth by an extra 1 percent annually for the next four years and increase take-home pay for the average American household by as much as $13,300 over the long run. Those increases would be a dramatic improvement—but the chance that they happen is minimal. For all of the hype, the budget bill mostly keeps things as they are from a macroeconomic perspective. (The provisions that have gotten the most attention, such as cutting Medicaid, will have a big impact on individuals, but probably not a huge effect on the economy.)

Trump's tax cuts—and the change in the expensing of investments—should help the economy grow marginally faster. But on the flip side, the budget bill is phasing out a host of tax credits and subsidies for renewable energy, which will slow investment in the sector and probably raise energy prices. And the Council of Economic Advisers' forecast is, in any case, very much an outlier; the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will boost GDP economic growth by a total of 0.5 percent over a decade, whereas the Yale Budget Lab sees a boost of just 0.2 percent that it estimates will last only three years. Meanwhile, Trump's tariffs will be a slow but steady drag on the economy, by raising prices on imported goods. The effect of the administration's policies also means that tourism is likely to take a significant hit.

What this adds up to is an economy that's likely to be worse than it was (one reason Trump is agitating so fiercely for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates) but not in an especially dramatic way. Trump's policies—including his tariffs, his slashing of funding for scientific and medical research, and his war on renewable energy—will be bad for the fundamentals of the U.S. economy in the long term. But in the short term, it won't be surprising if the economy remains … okay.

The problem for Trump is that just “okay” is not good enough for American voters, who were deeply unhappy with the state of the economy last year and are actually unhappier with it today. Consumer sentiment, as measured by both the University of Michigan and the Conference Board, is significantly more depressed than it was a year ago. Most Americans think a recession is somewhat or very likely to occur in the next year. And they're unhappy with Trump as a result: Quinnipiac Poll found that only 40 percent of those surveyed approved of his handling of the economy. For Republicans in Congress looking toward the midterm elections in 2026, the prospect of being dragged down by their leader's low approvals could become alarming.

“Things are fine” didn't work as a message for Joe Biden. It isn't likely to work for Trump either.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Pro-wrestling—and America?—were never the same.

Listen to more stories on hark

Here's how I know I'm not a real fan of professional wrestling.

Because every now and again, when I'm at a wrestling show in Massachusetts, where I live—whether it's a World Wrestling Entertainment event at the TD Garden, in Boston (19,000 people), or a Rad Pro Rasslin' event at the Elks Lodge in Newburyport (78-ish people)—and I'm watching the wrestlers strut and grimace and go flying, and wedge themselves, red-faced, into a wrangle of limbs, and grab the mic and make their speeches, aggrieved or blustering or ramblingly odd, I'll find myself thinking: Uh, couldn't this, shouldn't this, all be just a little bit, you know, better?

This thought would never occur to a real fan of pro wrestling.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

But I'm sensing a furrow in the readerly brow: Pro wrestling ? Isn't that the fake stuff? Rigged battles, hollow contests, the wrestlers cartoonishly lumbering and bellowing, the crowd in a low-rent delirium of suspended disbelief or hypertrophied half-belief or something? The tights, the glitz, the nonsense? Yes, it is; yes, it is. It's also an extraordinary, and extraordinarily vital, cultural form: essentially American in its clanking, fantastical performance of Self, but also pre-American, reaching back into carnival, burlesque, masks, magic, the dark roots of theater itself. Which is why I love it.

Let me explain.

Pro wrestling is storytelling. It has good guys (babyfaces) and bad guys (heels) and in-between guys (most wrestlers). It has archetypally compelling scenarios: little man fights big man; battered underdog finds wild reserve of pugnacity; old-timer staggers out for one last contest; preening overlord humiliates all, et cetera. The action is fictional, in the sense that the outcomes are prearranged—agreed upon by the promoters, the wrestlers, and their writers or “bookers” (if they have them)—and many of the moves are choreographed, but it's also real. Those crashings, those sounds of impact cannot be counterfeited; those wrestlers, night after night, are “taking their bumps,” their real-time, real-pain, real-surgery-will-be-necessary-one-day lumps. The ring itself has a double nature: Made momentarily weightless, twanged skyward by the angelic tension of the ropes, the wrestlers thunder to Earth as they land on the canvas. (Or on the flooring around the ring. Or on the ringside table of the commentary team, scattering the mics.) No repeal of gravity.

Read: How wrestling explains America

Huge, artificial characters, stalking around within touching distance (don't touch the wrestlers!), within smelling distance (inhale the wrestlers!), getting shouted at, shouting back; an audience primed for disorientation, ready to be taken almost anywhere; the entire space activated, energized, hummingly theatricalized. That pro wrestling so often seems—to me—to be underachieving, allowing its almost unlimited artistic-dramatic potential to dissipate in lame bombast and puffery and stomping-about, is part of its endless fascination.

This, as I say, is not how a real wrestling fan thinks. My friend Lexi, with whom I go to all the wrestling shows—she has been my Virgil in this noisy, gaudy underworld—she's a real wrestling fan, from childhood. She is a connoisseur of both the theatrical and the technical elements of pro wrestling. All the characters, all the moves. Her sense of irony is acute. But with Lexi—as with every real wrestling fan—there's a mysterious, enchanted approach to the whole wrestling gestalt going on. A primordial buy-in, before the thinking starts: the Wrestling Mind.

Imagine a place where you don't have to choose between the real and the unreal—a place, in fact, where the nonstop oscillation between real and unreal is ritualized and crudely yet brilliantly dramatized. But to truly get there, to truly dig it, you need to enter the Wrestling Mind. And for a finicky aesthete like me, that's a problem. Drinking certainly helps. (Nothing drastic: A couple of nice Bud Lights will do. I'm a cheap date.) Still, while all around me the real wrestling fans are whooping and roaring and cracking mean, hilarious jokes, throned high and superb in the Wrestling Mind, I'll be levels below, fussing around with my critical misgivings.

Such as: This wrestler's monologue, in which he's vowing loud vengeance upon his current nemesis—why is it so clunky, so verbally stale? He's seized the mic; he has our attention. There might be 10,000 people listening intently. Why isn't it funnier? Why isn't it sharper? Why isn't it more insane? Why isn't it an Elizabethan diatribe, full of strange and bloody imaginings? Why isn't it better written?

Or: How come there's always this air pocket of anticlimax after the wrestler's entrance music stops? Especially at the big shows, in the arenas. Cody Rhodes walks out, peroxide stare, looking like the security detail for an alien emperor, and the whole place rattles in an ecstasy of concrete and heads-thrown-back to his heavy-metal anthem, “Kingdom”: “Out the curtain, lights go up, I'm home. Whooa-ooa! ” But then the wrestler reaches the ring, the song ends, and—whoosh—the voltage drops … bathos dilates … desultory crowd-buzz … Here we are now, entertain us … It feels like a failure of dramaturgy. Seriously: Shouldn't somebody fix this?

Considered as spectacle, pro wrestling—especially at the local level—fits almost perfectly the description of “Rough Theatre” given to us by the English director and radical Shakespearean Peter Brook in his book The Empty Space. (The fact that he doesn't mention wrestling once makes it even better.) “Salt, sweat, noise, smell,” Brook writes, “the theatre that's not in a theatre, the theatre on carts, on wagons, on trestles, audiences standing, drinking, sitting round tables, audiences joining in, answering back.”

Pleased by the show, spectators will chant This-is-awe-some! or Ho-ly-shit! and the wrestlers will throb happily and seem to float. But a match that leaves the crowd cold will congeal before your eyes. It's alarming to watch: The wrestlers are huffing and puffing and sweating like fiends to “get over” (elicit a reaction)—but apparently someone has installed an evil energy-draining, drama-draining magnet under the ring. Nothing works. Nothing can work while this terrible magnet is operative. They heave, they thrash, they pound the canvas with their palms. Nothing. The crowd will not engage, insisting rather on exercising its fatal mandate of indifference. Such loneliness in the ring! This is the despair of wrestlers: unredeemed perspiration, useless bruises.

So for all the scriptedness, the “fakeness,” there's an unpredictability. An air of reckless improv. Of hazard and mood swing. One take, no do-overs. Brook again: “The Rough Theatre doesn't pick and choose: If the audience is restive, then it is obviously more important to holler at the trouble makers—or improvise a gag—than to try to preserve the unity of style of the scene.” In my mind's eye now is the wrestler Dj Powers, expert purveyor of oiled-up heel attitude, at an event in a bar called Electric Haze in Worcester: Heckled from all sides, fuming on a pyre of abuse, Powers is screaming, “Shut up! You love me! ” as he launches himself from the top rope.

Narrative breakout, narrative fire: That's the goal. Your storyline catches on; it keeps the people coming back. For all concerned, this is the ultimate pro-wrestling high. If it happens, then you're on a “run”—a gorgeous (and very profitable) slalom through the Wrestling Mind, fed into, collaborated with, psychically crowdfunded by the fans. It can last six months, a year, two years even, depending on how skillfully it's handled. Most of the time it doesn't happen. But sometimes it really, really does.

In Say Hello to the Bad Guys: How Professional Wrestling's New World Order Changed America, the ESPN reporter Marc Raimondi chronicles one of those times. His book is sort of a cultural study, sort of a business story, but primarily it expounds upon a very powerful moment in wrestling storytelling: when Hulk Hogan turned heel.

July 7, 1996, Daytona Beach, Florida. The event is the “Bash at the Beach,” a televised showcase for the Ted Turner–owned World Championship Wrestling, rival to Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation. In the ring, two flaming heels, two bullyboys—Scott Hall and Kevin Nash—are brawling with, and somewhat getting the better of, a three-man tag team: Sting, Lex Luger, and “Macho Man” Randy Savage. Nash has already kicked Savage in the gut—the cheap shot, the low blow!—thus guaranteeing the odium of the arena, and Luger has been knocked out cold (really? fakely? unclear!) and gurneyed away.

So now it's two on two, Hall and Nash versus Savage and Sting, and we're in the wallowing, slo-mo, death-blow phase of the match, the moves heavier and more reverberative, the wrestlers shining with exhaustion. Soon all four wrestlers are prone on the canvas, stunned, rolling feebly. (This is a standard tableau in pro wrestling, its version of the last scene of Hamlet : bodies everywhere.)

But wait! Someone is storming toward the ring. Who, what? “Hulkamania!  Hulk Hogan is here! Hulk Hogan is here!” scream the announcers, their voices blending in frenzy. “Go get 'em, Hulkster!”

Okay: pause. Rewind. A little context here. At this point, Hulk Hogan—real name Terry Gene Bollea—has been on the WCW roster for roughly two years. Prior to that, he wrestled for Vince McMahon in the WWF, where he and McMahon created the extraordinarily successful Hulk Hogan character: a babyface all the way, an all-American hero, beloved of children (his little Hulkamaniacs), clad in bright reds and yellows like a beautifully muscled crayon or piece of candy. A hunk with platinum hair, platinum mustache; friendly, bald crown; kind, droopy eyes; and a patriotic, virtue-promoting line in big-man patter—“Train. Say your prayers. Eat your vitamins. Be true to yourself, true to your country. Be a real American. Ooof!”

So the expectation, as Hogan makes his way toward the ring, is that he's going to lay the heels—Hall and Nash—low. Hogan climbs into the ring; he tears off his SpongeBob-yellow tank top; he dazzles the terraced fans with the gleaming caramel planes of his torso. And then he bounces once off the ropes and does a leg drop—not on Hall or Nash, but on “Macho Man” Randy Savage. Treachery! After which he stands up and gloatingly high-fives the two heels.

In the arena, joy's fuse is quenched. Stillness. Sour, scattered sounds of outrage. The commentary team is apoplectic with despair: “What the hell is going on? Oh my God! Are you kidding me?!” The announcers' horror rises. “A career of a lifetime right down the drain, kid.” A hail of fast-food wrappers and paper cups starts falling in the ring. “He has slept with the devil!”

There had been heel turns before, and there have been heel turns since—but this one was a doozy. Who gets the credit here, the writer's credit? That would be Eric Bischoff, WCW senior vice president. Having lured Hogan over from the WWF, Bischoff had noted a gradual ebbing in the current of Hulkamania. “After the new car smell went away,” he told Raimondi, “it was kind of like a ‘seen that, done that, been there, what's next' kind of thing.” Bischoff was also in the mood for some sensational, reality-busting storytelling. “When you see things you've never seen before, your brain automatically shifts into ‘Oh my God, I've never seen this before—it must be real.' ” He pitched it to Hogan in 1995: What if he became a bad guy? Hogan threw him out of his house.

A year later, he was ready for it—although not without his doubts, as he told Raimondi. “I went, ‘Oh boy, when I turn heel, this is going to either destroy my career or this is going to be the greatest thing that ever happened in wrestling.' ” At Daytona Beach, the Hulkster went on to announce that he, Nash, and Hall were now a team: a heel trinity called the New World Order, which was soon the hottest thing in pro wrestling. Hall, Nash, and Hogan—now wearing black and cultivating vicious dark stubble around his platinum mustache—were stylish meanies. They were stylish meta-meanies: Nash and Hall broke into the control room during WCW's show Monday Nitro and pushed the producers around—wrestling as reality TV.

By now it will be clear that the real world, where most of us spend at least a couple of hours every day, is basically a footnote to pro wrestling. But it does exist, so it is necessary to recall the image of Hogan ranting at the 2024 Republican National Convention. “Let Trumpamania run wild, brother! Let Trumpamania rule again!” Wrestling as politics, politics as wrestling: Many have pondered the connection. Did the success of the New World Order seed the culture with a virus of heeldom triumphant, which would eventually flare up and flourish in the gleeful malevolence of Trumpism? Did Bischoff's bravura storytelling end up breaking off another chunk of consensus reality, like ice from a melting glacier? Raimondi hauls in some sociology professors at the end of his book, for intellectual heft, but his case is already made: The ones least caught out by the rise of Donald Trump were the real wrestling fans. To them, it was all very familiar.

Pro wrestling happens (mainly) in the ring; it also happens in the imagination. Those booming, rattling arenas, and those riotous little halls, are imaginary spaces. Sometimes the action is rough theater; sometimes it's opera buffa; sometimes it's sheer absurdity; sometimes it's close to tragedy. Could it be better? Better written, better organized, a more efficient vehicle for whatever it is in the moment? No doubt it could. But if it was better, it would be worse.

Besides—and let's all hang on to this idea, right now—there's always another twist coming.

What's happening in the Democratic Party? A Vox reporter explains.

Last weekend, my colleague Christian Paz wrote about how the Democratic Party could be on the brink of a grassroots takeover, similar to what the GOP experienced with the Tea Party movement. It's a fascinating piece that could have huge ramifications for Democratic politics, so I sat down with him to chat about his reporting for Vox's daily newsletter, Today, Explained.

Our conversation is below, and you can sign up for the newsletter here for more conversations like this.

Hey, Christian, how are you? Remind us what the original Tea Party was. What is this movement we're talking about?

The movement that I'm talking about started before Obama was elected. It was a mostly libertarian, grassroots, localized, not-that-big movement — a reaction to the bailouts at the end of the Bush administration. The idea being there's too much deficit spending and government is becoming way too big and becoming unmoored from constitutional limited-government principles.

It evolved when Obama was elected into a broader anti-Obama backlash and then a major explosion because of the Affordable Care Act fights. It basically turned into an effort to primary incumbent Republicans, an effort to move the party more toward this wing and eventually try to win back control of Congress.

After it took off, what happened to the GOP?

They were able to win, I believe, five out of the 10 Senate seats that they were challenging. Something like 40 members of Congress were Tea Party-affiliated.

The primary thing was that they were successful in massively mobilizing Republican voters and getting people to turn out in the 2010 midterms, which turned out to be one of the biggest “shellackings,” as Obama called it, that Democrats or that any incumbent president and their party had sustained. Democrats lost control of the House and lost seats in the Senate, and that was a massive setback.

From then on, what happened was a successful move by more conservative primary challengers in future elections, the most iconic one being in 2014 — the primary that ousted Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, in favor of a Tea Party activist. It also forced the party as a whole to move to the right, making it more combative, more extreme, and more captive to a more ideological part of the Republican base.

Why are we hearing about this now with the Democratic Party?

The underlying idea is that there's a divide between the establishment Democrats and populist-minded progressive Democratic candidates. And that's part of the reason why we're hearing this now, because there was a victory in New York City's mayoral primary by Zohran Mamdani, a candidate who is fully in that latter category — a self-described democratic socialist appealing to this idea of bringing out new parts of the electorate, mobilizing people with populist appeal, with targeted, non-polished messaging, and taking more left-leaning positions on policy.

The big thing fueling talk about this Tea Party moment for Democrats is that the base has never really been as angry as it is right now. What we're seeing is a combination of anti-Trump anger, wanting a change in direction, wanting a change in leadership, and also some folks who are like, Maybe we should become more progressive as a party.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

So tell me about that. A change in leadership, a change in the establishment — what does this movement actually want?

It's interesting. Because at least back with the original Tea Party movement, you could point to a core list of priorities there were about repealing Obamacare, about never repeating a bailout, about limiting the federal government's ability to spend.

Something like that doesn't exist right now, because it is a pretty disparate energy. The core thing is Democratic voters do not want the current leadership in Congress. They don't like Hakeem Jeffries's style of leadership in the House. They don't like Chuck Schumer's style of leadership in the Senate. There's frustration at older members of Congress being in Congress and serving in leadership capacity right now.

In the polling, over and over again, we see, Democrats should be focused on providing a working-class vision for Americans. They should be more focused on kitchen table affordability issues. And that is the thing that most Democratic voters can actually agree on, and basically saying that that's not what they think their current leadership is focused on.

What would it look like for the Democratic Party if this actually happens?

There are some strategists and activists who are drawing up lists of potential candidates to primary. There are already some challenges underway. I'm thinking of some House seats in Arizona, House seats in Illinois. There's talk, especially after this New York City mayoral contest, about primarying Kirsten Gillibrand or Chuck Schumer and finding challengers to some more moderate House members in the New York area.

I'd be looking to see if there actually are younger people launching primary campaigns targeting older or centrist Democratic members of Congress. Once we get to primary season next year, how successful in fundraising are these candidates? Is there an actual effort by some established progressive members of the House to try to support some of these younger candidates?

Basically, just seeing if there's money there, if there's actual interest there in supporting these candidates, and whether we do see primary challenges in New York, in Massachusetts, be successful.

July Fourth isn't as simple as celebrating the red, white, and blue.

Imagine your average Fourth of July party. There are probably hot dogs on the grill, everyone is clad in red, white, and blue, and it culminates in a fireworks show. It may sound like a lovely way to spend a day off. But for a lot of Americans, the celebration, and the flag itself, are more complicated than that. 

That's the question that Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in show, is setting out to tackle this holiday weekend: What's the relationship like between Black people and the American flag? 

Specifically, one listener wanted to know, in the wake of the red-white-and-blue spectacle of Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter and Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl halftime show, how that conversation has evolved over time.

This is something Ted Johnson thinks a lot about. Johnson, who is Black, is an adviser at the liberal think tank New America, a columnist at the Washington Post, and a retired US Navy commander. “The flag has sort of been hijacked by nationalists — folks who believe either America is perfect and exceptional, or at the very least, anything that it's done wrong in the past should be excused by all the things that it's done well,” Johnson told Vox. “And that is not my relationship with the flag. It's much more complicated because there has been tons of harm done under that flag.”

How do Black Americans square that harm and that pride? And how has that relationship changed through the years? Below is an excerpt of the conversation with Johnson, edited for length and clarity.

You can listen to Explain It to Me on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

One way to tease out this relationship between Black Americans and the flag is to talk about the experience of Black service members. What's that history?

One of the earliest instances is the story of an enslaved man named Jehu Grant in Rhode Island during the Revolutionary War. The man that owned him was a loyalist to the Brits. Grant was afraid that he was going to be shipped off and sold to the Brits to fight for them. So he runs away, joins Washington's army and fights in the Continental Army, and then his master shows up and says, “You've got my property, and I want it back.” And the Army turns him back over to the guy that owns him, where he serves for many years and eventually buys his freedom. 

When Andrew Jackson becomes president in the 1820s, he makes it policy to provide pensions for those Revolutionary War folks still alive. And so Grant applies for his pension and is denied. The government says that services rendered while a fugitive from your master are not recognized. 

That is the relationship of Black service members to the flag. It represents a set of principles that many would be willing to die for and also a way of life that intentionally excluded Black folks for no other reason than race and status of their servitude. And so if you look at any war, you will find Black folks in uniform who have both been oppressed in the country they represent, and are willing to die for that country because of the values it stands for and for their right to be able to serve and benefit from the programs that the military has made available to folks.

My grandfather served in the military and I never got the chance to really talk with him about that experience. But I'm curious if you can speak to the motivations of Black Americans who continue serving, especially during the Jim Crow era.

Pre-Civil War, a lot of enslaved Black folks that decided to fight did so because they believed their chances at liberty, emancipation, and freedom were connected to their willingness to serve the country. Then we get the draft and a lot of the Black folks that served in the early part of the 20th century were drafted into service. They weren't eager volunteers lining up as a way of earning their citizenship, but the fact that the vast majority of them honored that draft notice even though they were treated as second-class citizens was a sort of implicit demand for access to the full rights of the Constitution.

“There is a belief that the United States is ours as well. We have a claim of ownership. And to claim ownership also means you must sort of participate in the sacrifice.”

I'd be remiss if I say that folks joining today, for example, are doing so because they love the flag. The military has a great pension program. The military offers great programs if you want to buy a home or if you want to get an education. So there's a sort of socioeconomic attractiveness to the military that I think explains why Black folks continue to join the military post-draft.

But it is also because there is a belief that the United States is ours as well. We have a claim of ownership. And to claim ownership also means you must sort of participate in the sacrifice.

When a lot of those service members came back from war, they were met with systemic institutionalized racism. How were people continuing to foster that sense of patriotism despite all that?

When Black folks were coming home from World War I and II, many were lynched in uniform.They weren't even excused from the racial dynamics by being willing to die for the country. 

One of the most famous genres of music in this period was called coon music. One of the songs was about Black people not having a flag. They talked about how white folks in the Northeast could fly flags from Italy, Ireland, wherever they're from. And white people in the States could just fly the American flag. Black people could fly none of those because we didn't know where we were from and the United States is not ours. And so in this song, they say the Black flag is basically two possums shooting dice and that would be an accurate representation.

Wow. That is some classic old-school racism. 

Yeah, the song is called “Every Race Has a Flag, but the Coon.” And so we are very familiar with the red, black, and green pan-African flag. This was Marcus Garvey's response to this coon genre of music. 

There's this idea among Black Americans of, We built this. Of course I'm going to reclaim this. Of course I'm going to have pride in it because I built it. I think that's what we're seeing with a lot of the imagery now. 

But what about Black artists and also Black people in general who say, Our ancestors may have done all this work, but there really is no way to be a part of this and maybe we should not be trying to be a part of this?

If you take pride in the flag because you believe America is exceptional, you're going to find a lot fewer subscribers to that belief system than one where your pride in the country means being proud of the people you come from and proud of the arc of your people's story in this country. 

On the latter, you will find people who are very proud of what Black people have accomplished in this country. For me, patriotism means honoring those sacrifices, those people that came before us. It does not mean excusing the United States from its racism, from its perpetuated inequality, or for putting its national interests ahead of the people that it's supposed to serve. So it is very complicated, and there's no easy way through it.

I will say that I think part of the reason we're seeing more folks willing to sort of reclaim the flag for their own is because of Gen X. My generation was the first one born post-Civil Rights Act of 1964, so Jim Crow was the experience of our parents. Those experiences connected to the hijacking of the flag to connect it to explicit statutory racism feels generations removed from folks who have grown up in America where opportunity is more available, where the Jim Crow kind of racism is not as permitted. And while the country is not even close to being the kind of equal nation it says it was founded to be, it's made progress. 

I think a reclamation of that flag by Beyoncé and others is a sort of signal that yes, we built it. Yes, we've progressed here. And no, we're not leaving. There's no “go back to Africa.” This is home. And if this is home, I'm going to fly the flag of my country. There's lots to be proud of about what the country has achieved and by Black Americans in particular. And for me, that is all the things that patriotism represents, not the more narrow exclusive version that tends to get more daylight.

I think one thing we need to discuss is the definition of Black we're using here. I am what they would call Black American. My ancestors are from Alabama and Arkansas. They were formerly enslaved. 

But Blackness in America now has a much wider net. I have so many friends whose parents are immigrants from the Caribbean or Africa. And it's interesting in this moment where there are lots of conversations about what it means to be Black, and who gets to claim it, we're also seeing this flag resurgence.

I think probably true that there are more Black people who are first-generation Americans today than there have been since they started erasing our nations of origin during slavery. That means Black American doesn't just mean people who descended from slaves. It means Black people of all kinds.

When we talk about Black politics, we don't consider the Black immigrant experience. When we talk about Black Americanism or Black patriotism, we often don't account for the Black immigrant experience, except to the extent that that experience is shed and the American one is adopted. Those views sort of get thrown into this pot of Blackness instead of disaggregated to show how Black folks from other places who become Americans have a distinct relationship with the country that also affects their relationship with the iconography of the country like the flag, the national anthem, and this reclamation of red, white, and blue.

There may be some Black artists — I think of Beyoncé — who are reclaiming this imagery, but we also can't ignore who has a majority stake in it. When people think of the flag, they think of white people. Is that changing?

It is, but slowly. If you ask people from around the world to picture a stereotypical American, they're not picturing LeBron James, despite the medals he's won at the Olympics. They're probably picturing a white man from the Midwest. 

The fact that so much of our nation's history is racialized means that many of the nation's symbols are also racialized. And to deracialize the things that were created in its origin is a long-term process. I do think it's beginning to happen. I think it's going to be some time before we get to a de-racialized conception of the United States.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Elon Musk says he's formed the 'America Party.' Mark Cuban and Anthony Scaramucci are interested.","https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-america-party-2025-7","Sun, 06 Jul 2025 13:40:00 GMT","

Elon Musk declared on X the formation of a new political party amid his ongoing feud with President Donald Trump over the ""Big Beautiful Bill.""

""Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom,"" Musk wrote in an X post on Saturday afternoon.

The Tesla CEO had said Friday on his social media platform that one way the new party could work is to focus on winning just a handful of Senate seats and House districts that could serve as the ""deciding vote"" on ""contentious laws,"" given the ""razor-thin legislative margins"" in Congress.

When asked for comment on Musk's new party, the White House said Trump had ""unified"" the Republican Party.

""Having earned the largest share of votes for a Republican presidential nominee and secured majorities in the House and Senate, and with his historic domestic policy agenda swiftly and successfully passed through One Big Beautiful Bill with resounding GOP support, the party is stronger than ever and in lockstep with the Trump agenda,"" Harrison Fields, the principal White House deputy press secretary, told BI over email.

Fellow billionaire Mark Cuban, meanwhile, appeared — not for the first time — to support the idea of a new party, replying to Musk's Saturday announcement with a series of fireworks and fire emojis.

""I work with @voterchoice. They will help you get on ballots. That is their mission,"" Cuban wrote in another post.

SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House communications director under Trump in 2017, also appeared interested.

""I would like to meet to discuss. My DMs are open,"" he replied to Musk.

Musk's ""America Party"" announcement came after he conducted a July 4 poll, asking X users if they want ""independence"" from the two-party system. About 65% of the 1.25 million participants voted ""Yes.""

Musk, who was a staunch supporter of Trump's 2024 reelection bid, has been publicly critical of the president's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" a sweeping domestic policy bill that includes extensive tax cuts and could add more than $3 trillion to the national debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Musk has characterized the bill on X as a form of ""debt slavery.""

Just days after stepping away from his work at the White House DOGE Office, which was tasked with cutting spending and reducing the deficit, Musk in June called the legislation a ""massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill.""

Musk then proposed the idea of forming a new political party that represents the ""80% in the middle.""

Musk's repeated attacks on the bill led to a spectacular public fallout between him and the president. Trump even suggested that his office would look into possibly deporting Musk, a South African immigrant.

Musk's July 4 poll on X came the same day Trump signed the bill into law.

Musk and a White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

Musk's back-and-forth regarding his involvement in political affairs has been followed by volatile times for the CEO of Tesla, his EV company.

Wall Street analysts, including Tesla bull Dan Ives, have said that Musk's politics could lead the company astray if the chief executive doesn't snap back into focus.

Earlier in June, Baird analysts downgraded the Tesla stock, noting that the Musk-Trump spat adds ""uncertainty to TSLA's outlook.

On what should have been a festive Fourth of July, disaster struck in Central Texas.

Flash flooding left at least 59 dead in Kerr County, including 21 children. About a dozen children are still missing from Camp Mystic, a Christian camp for girls along the Guadalupe River, official said on Sunday.

Gov. Greg Abbott on Saturday signed a federal disaster declaration, which Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said President Donald Trump would ""honor.""

""I've visited with the president already about this federal disaster declaration that the governor was going to sign here this morning, and he has indicated that he will honor that and that he will accept that, so that response and that relief will be coming,"" Noem said.

Abbott also issued a disaster declaration for six Texas counties in addition to the 15 he identified on Friday, when heavy rains first caused the flooding.

On Truth Social, Trump said his administration was working with state and local officials to respond to the flooding.

""Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy,"" Trump wrote on Saturday. ""Our Brave First Responders are on site doing what they do best. GOD BLESS THE FAMILIES, AND GOD BLESS TEXAS!""

The X account for Elon Musk's Starlink, SpaceX's satellite internet system, is offering support to affected residents. Musk has a strong presence in Texas through his companies Tesla, X, and SpaceX.

""In support of those impacted by flooding in Texas, Starlink is providing Mini kits for search and rescue efforts — ensuring connectivity even in dead zones — and one month of free service for thousands of customers in the region, including those who paused service so they can reactivate Starlink during this time,"" the post said.

Officials said as much as 12 inches of rain fell in the county on Friday, and additional rainfall is expected over the weekend. The National Weather Service first issued a flash flood warning at 4 a.m. on Friday.

A desperate search is underway for survivors. Officials did not say how many might still be missing, outside the group staying at Camp Mystic. Located in Hunt, the summer camp has about 750 campers.

""That does not mean they've been lost,"" Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said at a press conference Friday afternoon. ""They could be in a tree. They could be out of communication. We're praying for all those missing to be found alive.""

In a statement posted to its website, the Heart O' the Hills, another girls' camp based in Hunt, said its director, Jane Ragsdale, had died in the floods.

""We have received word that Jane Ragsdale did not make it,"" it said. ""We are mourning the loss of a woman who influenced countless lives and was the definition of strong and powerful.""

It added that the camp was not in session as the flooding hit, and that ""most of those who were on camp at the time have been accounted for and are on high ground.""

Patrick said during the afternoon press conference that the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in 45 minutes.

On Facebook, parents and community members have circulated flyers with contact numbers, urging the public to help locate the missing children.

Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said at a press conference on Saturday morning that he expected the death toll to rise.

Kerr County has an estimated population of about 53,900, according to a 2024 count by the US Census Bureau. The county sits in the Hill Country region of Central Texas, which includes cities like San Antonio and Austin. Beyond the Guadalupe River, the region is home to several others, including the Colorado, Concho, and Blanco Rivers.

With the county focused on locating the missing, several local cities have canceled Independence Day events.

Trump's Tariffs:

Thailand is pushing for a best-case rate of 10%.

Thailand is making a last-ditch effort to avert a punitive 36% export levy threatened by the Trump administration with offers of greater market access for US farm and industrial goods, along with increased purchases of energy and Boeing jets. 

Bangkok's latest proposal aims to boost bilateral trade volume and reduce Thailand's $46 billion trade surplus with the US by 70% within five years, reaching balance in seven to eight years, Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira told Bloomberg News in an interview late Sunday. That's quicker than the pledge to wipe the gap in a decade under an earlier proposal submitted by Thailand.  ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Saudi Arabia raised prices for its main crude grade for buyers in Asia next month by more than its customers had been expecting, a sign Riyadh is confident the market is strong enough to withstand extra supplies that OPEC+ is adding.

State producer Aramco will raise the price for Arab Light crude, its flagship grade, by $1 a barrel to $2.20 a barrel more than the regional benchmark for Asian customers in August, according to a price sheet from the company seen by Bloomberg. Three refinery officials in Asia expressed their surprise at the size of the increase. Aramco was expected to raise Arab Light by 65 cents a barrel, according to a survey of traders and refiners.

Latin American economies have handed investors some of their best returns, with Mexico's local bonds, known as Mbonos, generating a gain of 22%.

US policy volatility has sent money managers scouring the world for alternatives, propelling local bonds from emerging-market countries to their best first half in 16 years.

The surge in demand for fixed-income assets in EM currencies is largely the flip side of sinking confidence in the US dollar, which has tumbled almost 11% this year, in part because of President Donald Trump's trade war and push for tax cuts despite a swelling budget deficit.

The GOP tax bill gives Trump far too much money — and authority — to rescue his failing immigration crackdown. 

A preview of what's to come.

One of the biggest spending items in the Republican budget bill has hardly gotten any attention: $170 billion for an unprecedented crackdown on immigration. By some calculations, it would make the annual budget of Immigration and Customs Enforcement larger than Israel's entire defense budget.

The supplemental funds — to be spent over the next four years — would leave vital aspects of immigration reform unaddressed. But the funding is essential to President Donald Trump's mass deportation plans. Vice President JD Vance left little doubt of that when he posted on social media, “Everything else — the [Congressional Budget Office] score, the proper baseline, the minutiae of the Medicaid policy — is immaterial compared to the ICE money and immigration enforcement provisions.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

At least 70 people have died and many children are missing in the Texas Hill Country after catastrophic flooding that left officials struggling to explain whether they did enough to warn people of the fast-rising waters.

Eleven campers and a counselor from Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, remain unaccounted for, Sheriff Larry Leitha told reporters Sunday. The death toll rose to 38 adults and 21 children, he said. At least 11 others have died in nearby counties.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

South Korean and US trade officials have discussed extending the July 9 deadline for trade deals in a last-minute bid to avert sweeping tariffs from President Donald Trump.

In this article

President Donald Trump's announcement of a U.S.-Vietnam trade deal and a solid June jobs report lifted stocks last week, but investors can still find plenty of opportunities to snap up names at attractive levels.

The recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help inform investors as they search for the stocks of companies with strong fundamentals and solid growth opportunities.  

Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

This week's first stock pick is Dell Technologies (DELL), a provider of IT hardware, software, and services.

Following meetings with management, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated a buy rating on Dell with a price target of $150. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on DELL with a price target of $128.

Notably, Daryanani stated that he came away from the meetings incrementally positive about Dell's ability to deliver high-single-digit revenue growth and a double-digit increase in earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow (FCF). His optimism is backed by the initiatives taken by the company over the past two years to optimize its cost structure and tailwinds from key AI (artificial intelligence) investments.

Among the key takeaways from the meetings, the analyst highlighted that the AI server margins are turning out to be better than initially expected, with Dell earning a premium compared to rivals while delivering impressive growth. He also pointed out the company's innovations in its infrastructure offerings, with its internal liquid cooling capabilities becoming a more vital part of its strategy.

Daryanani added that Dell expects to benefit from acceleration in enterprise AI adoption over the next five to seven years. In fact, the company believes that higher-margin enterprise customers could account for the vast majority of AI server sales over time. Daryanani also noted Dell's confidence about navigating tariff woes, given that it ""believes its diversified and global footprint is an advantage over its competitors.""

Daryanani ranks No. 187 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.8%. See Dell Technologies Stock News and Insights on TipRanks.

We move to Trade Desk (TTD), a cloud-based advertising platform that providers advertisers with cutting-edge technology to find new audiences and grow their brands.

Recently, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney upgraded Trade Desk stock to Buy from Hold with a price forecast of $90. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on TTD stock, but with a lower price target of $83. Mahaney views the pullback in TTD stock as an attractive buying opportunity ""to get involved again in what has proved over time to be one of the highest quality and most consistent performers across the Internet landscape.""

Explaining his bullish stance, Mahaney stated that recent checks have indicated that online ad demand sentiment has clearly improved since April/May, though uncertainty about the second half of the year remains significant. He added that the checks reflect a clear improvement in Trade Desk's execution. Also, solid product announcements, like that of Deal Desk, helped address some concerns about the transition from the company's legacy platform Solimar to the AI-powered Kokai platform.

Mahaney mentioned that checks indicated a clear improvement in the company's execution, both on product and go-to-market strategy. While the analyst acknowledged increasing competition from Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP), he highlighted that Google's DV360 and not Trade Desk is more likely to be impacted due to its overlap with the areas where AMZN is strong.   

Finally, Mahaney thinks that Trade Desk's set-ups for the remainder of fiscal 2025 look quite achievable, with his billings analysis suggesting that the company is very likely to exit 2025 at premium growth levels (excluding political spend). He sees significant catalysts for 2026 such as the World Cup, the Winter Olympics and the full-year Kokai impact.

Mahaney ranks No. 214 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 60% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.0%. See Trade Desk Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

This week's third pick is e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN). In a research note dated July 1, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reaffirmed a buy rating and increased the Amazon stock price forecast to $255 from $250. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI analyst has assigned an ""outperform"" rating on AMZN stock with a price target of $233.

Thill raised his price target after Jefferies' proprietary survey of nearly 700 U.S. consumers in mid-/late June indicated that Amazon ""remains resilient despite price increases related to tariffs, with stable spend levels and upside if pricing on other websites becomes more expensive.""

The analyst noted that although 80% of the respondents are concerned about prices, the survey reflected a stable spending pattern by most Amazon shoppers (62% spent the same or more in the past three months). However, the survey noted some cost-conscious behavior, as 31% spent less in the past three months.

Thill highlighted that the survey also reflected that Amazon Prime remains the most popular membership and a major loyalty driver for the company. Notably, 73% of respondents reported having a Prime membership, compared to 26% for rival Walmart. He also noted Amazon's superior positioning on fast and free shipping, selection, and low prices.

The analyst said that given the heightened focus on prices, Amazon's Prime Day event could turn out to be more popular and impactful by running for four days instead of two (from July 8 to July 11 vs. July 16 to July 17 in 2024) across 20 countries. He expects the event to result in incremental Prime memberships, particularly among students and young adults ages 18 to 24 via six-month extended free trials.

Thill ranks No. 109 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 15.2%. See Amazon Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

China's finance ministry said on Sunday it was restricting government purchases of medical devices from the European Union that exceed 45 million yuan ($6.3 million) in value, in retaliation to Brussels' own curbs last month.

Tensions between Beijing and Brussels have been rising, with the European Union imposing tariffs on China-built electric vehicles and Beijing slapping duties on imported brandy from the bloc.

The European Union said last month it was barring Chinese companies from participating in EU public tenders for medical devices worth 60 billion euros ($70 billion) or more per year after concluding that EU firms were not given fair access in China.

The measure announced by the European Commission was the first under the EU's International Procurement Instrument, which entered into force in 2022 and is designed to ensure reciprocal market access.

China's countermeasures were expected after its commerce ministry flagged ""necessary steps"" against the EU move late last month.

""Regrettably, despite China's goodwill and sincerity, the EU has insisted on going its own way, taking restrictive measures and building new protectionist barriers,"" the commerce ministry said in a separate statement on Sunday.

""Therefore, China has no choice but to adopt reciprocal restrictive measures.""

The EU delegation office in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

China will also restrict imports of medical devices from other countries that contain EU-made components worth more than 50% of the contract value, the finance ministry said. The measures come into force on Sunday.

The commerce ministry said products from European companies in China were not affected.

The world's second- and third-largest economies are due to hold a leaders' summit in China later in July.

On Friday, China also announced duties of up to 34.9% for five years on brandy originating in the European Union, most of it cognac from France, after concluding an investigation largely believed to be a response to Europe's EV tariffs.

Major cognac producers Pernod Ricard, LVMH and Remy Cointreau were spared from the levies, however, provided they sell at a minimum price, which China has not disclosed.

You've probably worked hard to build positive relationships. But what if, despite your best intentions, your communication is coming off as judgmental?

As the author of ""Managing Up,"" an executive coach to top performers at the world's biggest companies, and a professor of human behavior, I've seen how certain phrases — even ones that sound perfectly reasonable in your head — can chip away at trust.

People may hesitate to share ideas or information with you. You may stop getting invited to meetings or to social events. And before you know it, you're being labeled as resistant or not a team player. 

Here are five common phrases that can make you sound judgmental, even when you don't mean to be, and what to say instead. 

You may say this when someone brings up a problem that seems to have a straightforward solution. Maybe your friend is stressed about their inbox, and you mention, ""Why don't you just set up filters?"" Or your direct report is struggling to get buy-in on a decision, and you jump straight to, ""Why don't you just schedule one-on-ones?""

You think you're helping, but what the other person hears is: ""The answer is obvious, so why haven't you figured it out?"" They may need empathy before they're ready to problem-solve.

Get curious before offering solutions. For example: 

Once you understand the situation better, you can then suggest ideas with phrases like: 

At a family gathering, someone mentions, ""Grandma grew up in Ohio,"" and you jump in to clarify, ""Actually, it was Michigan."" Even small corrections like, ""Actually, the deadline is Friday,"" can come off harsher than intended.

Prefacing statements with ""actually"" can seem to imply, ""You're wrong and I'm right,"" or, ""You're not paying attention,"" and come off as condescending. 

Embrace ""yes, and..."" improv energy to build on others' ideas, not tear them down. Try: 

Signal humility with wording like: 

Over dinner you comment to your partner, ""If I'm being honest, I had more fun at the show than I thought I would."" Or you might use it to express feedback, like: ""Honestly, we should consider other options."" 

You're trying to be transparent. But saying ""to be honest…"" can subtly imply everything you said before wasn't truthful. Worse, it often signals criticism is coming, so people might get defensive before you've even made your point.

Drop the preamble and lead with the positive experience:  

If you're offering input, position your opinion as one possible perspective, not the only truth. For example: 

You can also use words that invite open-mindedness like: 

You might say this when someone's explanation or idea doesn't line up with your thinking or experience. For example, maybe a teammate says they're prioritizing a smaller client over a bigger one.

What you mean is, ""I don't understand your reasoning,"" but the subtext can be perceived as, ""Your logic is flawed."" Even if you're truly confused, this phrase puts the other person in the position of having to defend their intelligence. 

Acknowledge what you do understand or paraphrase what you've heard first. Try: 

You might genuinely be caught off guard when someone isn't aware of information that seems fundamental or well-known to you. Sometimes it's even a nervous reflex if you feel awkward for not catching an oversight sooner. 

By expressing ""surprise,"" you're inadvertently suggesting their lack of knowledge is unexpected and perhaps inappropriate for someone in their role.

Focus on being helpful rather than highlighting their unfamiliarity. Try: 

These phrases aren't always judgmental. Tone and timing matter, too. Be aware of both your intention and your impact and you can become the type of person others trust, respect, and want to invest in.

抱歉，發生錯誤

A Reddit post struck a nerve in the crypto community, sparking heated debate over one of investing's most painful questions: When do you take profits?

The post's central thesis is brutally simple: Despite what keyboard warriors claim today, virtually everyone who bought Bitcoin in its early days would have sold long before it reached current prices. And according to the poster—and basic investment principles—they would have been right to do so.

Don't Miss:

Trade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses — no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies.

The Reddit discussion reveals a fundamental tension between investment theory and human psychology. As one commenter noted, “If you 500x an investment yeah you sold lol.”

The math is compelling: If you bought Bitcoin at $1 and watched it climb to $100, you'd have made a 10,000% return. Taking profits at that point wasn't paper hands—it was prudent risk management. The fact that Bitcoin later reached $60,000+ doesn't retroactively make selling at $100 a mistake.

“Nothing is guaranteed in investing,” the original poster emphasized. “Anyone who saw their investment multiply by 1000x and didn't cash out was essentially gambling.”

One of the most insightful comments came from a user who highlighted how net worth influences selling decisions. A college student watching $500 turn into $10,000 faces a completely different calculus than a wealthy investor seeing the same percentage gain on a larger portfolio.

For the student, that $10,000 could mean a reliable car, reduced student debt, or a house down payment. For someone with substantial assets, letting it ride might make more sense as “play money.”

This observation cuts to the heart of position sizing and risk management—concepts that crypto's “diamond hands” culture often overlooks.

Trending: New to crypto? Get up to $400 in rewards for successfully completing short educational courses and making your first qualifying trade on Coinbase.

Not everyone agreed with the “everyone would have sold” narrative. Several commenters claimed to have held through massive gains, with one user reporting 300x returns while vowing to “never sell Bitcoin even at x3000.”

These holders share a common belief: Bitcoin represents a fundamental shift away from traditional currency, making it a “once in a lifetime” investment opportunity. As one put it, “Bitcoin's price is only expected to rise and fiat is only expected to plummet.”

But even among the diamond hands crowd, practical challenges emerged. One commenter admitted, “I've been holding BTC because I don't know where to sell it,” highlighting the gap between investment philosophy and execution.

The discussion wasn't without cautionary tales. One user shared how they lost 80% of their crypto holdings when the Voyager exchange collapsed, watching their “6 figure net worth reduced to 4 figure inside a week.”

This story underscores a critical point often lost in crypto success stories: unrealized gains aren't real until they're realized. The most perfect diamond hands strategy fails if you can't access your assets when you need them.

Some users proposed middle-ground strategies. One suggested time-locking Bitcoin to enforce long-term holding while still allowing eventual profit-taking—releasing a set amount each year over a decade, for instance.

This approach acknowledges both the potential for long-term growth and the human need to realize gains. It's a recognition that perfect market timing is impossible, but systematic profit-taking can work.

The Reddit thread's most valuable insight isn't about crypto specifically—it's about the nature of investing decisions. As one commenter noted, “Hindsight is a b*tch.”

Every investment decision must be made with incomplete information and uncertain outcomes. The person who sold Bitcoin at $100 made a rational decision based on the information available at the time. The fact that it continued rising doesn't invalidate that logic.

Start with position sizing: Never invest more than you can afford to lose completely. This makes holding through volatility psychologically easier.

Consider your circumstances: Your age, net worth, and financial obligations should influence your profit-taking strategy. What works for a 25-year-old may not work for a 45-year-old with a mortgage and kids.

Plan your exits: Before making any investment, decide at what point you'll take profits. Having a plan removes emotion from the decision.

Don't let perfect be the enemy of good: Taking some profits after significant gains isn't “paper hands”—it's risk management.

Remember the risks: Unrealized gains can disappear quickly. Exchange failures, regulatory changes, and market crashes are all real possibilities.

The Reddit discussion reveals an uncomfortable truth: Most successful long-term crypto holders succeeded despite their strategy, not because of it. The difference between conviction and stubbornness is often just luck.

For retail investors, the lesson isn't to abandon long-term thinking—it's to balance conviction with prudence. Take some profits along the way. You might miss some upside, but you'll sleep better at night.

And if you're beating yourself up for selling an investment “too early,” remember: You made a rational decision with the information you had. That's not failure—that's investing.

Major cryptocurrencies rose Sunday morning as the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at upcoming trade deals before the July 9 Liberation Day tariff deadline.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, gained over 1%, briefly topping $109,000. Payments-focused XRP and Solana's SOL token gained over 2% each, with meme token dogecoin DOGE$0.1707 rising 3%, according to data source CoinDesk. Ethereum's ether, the second-largest token, rose 1.5% to $2,550.

In an interview with CNN, Bessent stated that the U.S. is close to finalizing several trade deals ahead of the July 9 deadline, when the temporary pause in higher tariffs initially announced on April 2 is set to expire.

""President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,"" Bessent said, per Reuters.

Bessent explained that July 9 remains the deadline for negotiations, failing which higher tariffs, announced in early April, will take effect from Aug. 1.

""We are saying this is when it's happening. If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that's your choice,"" Bessent told CNN, adding that some countries were 'foot-dragging' on getting to deals.

Since taking office early this year, President Donald Trump has been focused on making the U.S. wealthy again by imposing tariffs on goods imported from other countries, a coercive tactic aimed at rebalancing trade relations and reducing the U.S. trade deficit.

Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, starting with a 10% base tax on all trading partners and additional amounts on many countries, with some ranging as high as 50%. The so-called Liberation Day announcement triggered a sell-off in financial markets, with U.S. stocks taking a significant hit alongside a sharp decline in bitcoin, which fell to $75,000.

The panic likely prompted the Trump administration to announce a 90-day pause a week later.

Since then, the so-called U.S. exceptionalism has resurfaced in financial markets, lifting major U.S. equity indices to record highs. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have outperformed their global peers, with BTC rallying to trade above $100,000.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Vitalik proposes gas cap to enhance Ethereum security, stability","https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-ethereum-gas-cap-eip-7983","Sun, 06 Jul 2025 12:56:10 GMT","

 Vitalik Buterin proposes EIP-7983 to cap transaction gas at 16.77 million, aiming to boost Ethereum security, stability, and zkVM compatibility. 

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and researcher Toni Wahrstätter have put forward EIP-7983, which aims to introduce a protocol-level cap on transaction gas usage to increase network security and performance.

The proposal sets a maximum gas limit of 16.77 million (2²⁴) for individual transactions. “By implementing this limit, Ethereum can enhance its resilience against certain DoS vectors, improve network stability, and provide more predictability to transaction processing costs,” the proposal reads.

Under the current Ethereum (ETH) architecture, a single transaction can theoretically consume the entire block's gas limit, posing a risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and leading to unpredictable network behavior.

By capping individual transactions, EIP-7983 seeks to distribute gas consumption more evenly, reducing the chance of single transactions overwhelming block capacity.

Related: Vitalik Buterin's vision for Ethereum: Pectra, Glamsterdam and beyond

The proposed cap is also designed to improve compatibility with zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs) by encouraging large transactions to be split into smaller chunks.

According to the draft, transactions specifying gas limits beyond 16.77 million would be rejected during block validation, ensuring they cannot enter the network or be included in new blocks. The cap is independent of the overall block gas limit, which miners and validators can still adjust within existing consensus rules.

Buterin and Wahrstätter chose 16.77 million as the cap to balance complexity and performance, arguing it accommodates current advanced DeFi use cases and contract deployments without introducing unnecessary risks.

“This value enables most current use cases including contract deployments and advanced DeFi interactions while ensuring consistent performance characteristics,” the proposal reads.

While the proposal isn't backward-compatible for transactions exceeding the new limit, the authors noted that most existing transactions fall well below the cap, minimizing the impact on users and developers.

EIP-7983 builds on prior efforts, like EIP-7825, to improve predictability in transaction execution.

Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling

In May, Buterin called for simplifying the Ethereum network's base protocol to boost efficiency, security, and accessibility, inspired by Bitcoin's minimalist approach.

At the time, he proposed restructuring Ethereum's architecture across consensus, execution, and shared components to achieve a leaner design within five years. Buterin argued that Ethereum's growing complexity has led to longer development times, higher costs, and increased security risks.

More recently, the Ethereum mastermind introduced a new kind of digital identity system dubbed “pluralistic identity,” arguing it could protect privacy while enabling fair participation in digital life.

While MicroStrategy popularized bitcoin as a store of value, SharpLink Gaming is revolutionizing the approach with Ethereum. The company holds 500 million dollars in ETH, which it presents as the “foundational layer of global finance.” A strategy that goes beyond a simple store of value.

On July 4, 2025, SharpLink Gaming marked a historic turning point. This Nasdaq-listed company, specializing in marketing for online sports betting, became the first public company to adopt Ethereum (ETH) as its primary treasury reserve asset.

This decision is based on a 425 million dollar private placement conducted at the end of May by Consensys, a giant in the Ethereum ecosystem. To seal this strategic commitment, Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Consensys, joined SharpLink's board as chairman.

SharpLink's ETH accumulation took place in several stages. Between late May and mid-June, the company acquired 176,271 ETH for a total of 463 million dollars, at an average price of 2,626 dollars per unit.

A few days later, it added an additional 12,207 ETH for 30.7 million dollars, partly financed by “At-The-Market” (ATM) stock sales.

As of July 1, the total treasury reached 198,478 ETH. Even more impressive: 100% of these assets are deployed in staking solutions, already generating more than 540,000 dollars in rewards since the launch of the strategy.

For SharpLink, Ethereum is not just an investment asset. The company considers it “the foundational layer of global finance,” an infrastructure capable of deeply transforming capital management.

Its conviction rests on three essential pillars:

Rob Phythian, CEO of SharpLink, perfectly summarizes this vision:

Ethereum is much more than a treasury asset. It is, in our view, the foundation of the next generation of financial infrastructures.

This strategy clearly differs from that of players like Strategy, whose approach is based on bitcoin as a pure store of value. Ethereum, on the other hand, offers a productive, programmable asset integrated into a rapidly expanding digital economy.

On the market side, ETH shows stability around 2,505 $, with a modest 0.56% increase in 24 hours. While the immediate impact remains limited, this technical resilience reflects growing institutional interest.

By betting heavily on ETH, SharpLink is not trying to follow a trend but to build a new standard. A standard where decentralized finance (DeFi) becomes a lasting part of the balance sheets of publicly traded companies.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Ethereum and Bitcoin are currently at the center of attention in the cryptocurrency community, with critical technical levels and ETF-driven moves shaping market dynamics in July 2025. The focus on these two major cryptocurrencies is pivotal for market participants, as it influences price actions and guides strategic investments.

Ethereum is currently consolidating above critical levels, with price analysis indicating indecision between crucial Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). This consolidation phase is crucial as it determines the direction of Ethereum's price movement. The ETH/BTC pair has found support near the 0.023 BTC level, suggesting a potential bottom for Ethereum, which has been trading just above the $2,500 mark. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 51.89 indicates that Ethereum could climb to the June high of $2,879 before entering overbought territory, which is defined by an RSI above 70. The ETH/BTC ratio remains a crucial chart for traders to monitor, as its dip to a low of 0.02307 before a slight recovery indicates Ethereum's underperformance relative to Bitcoin. This underperformance is consistent with the lag observed in Ethereum's reaction to Bitcoin flows, as shown in the ETF flow chart. Ethereum reacts late and weakly to surges in Bitcoin flows, which has been a recurring pattern.

Bitcoin's position strengthens with heightened ETF flow dynamics leading to increased institutional interest. The movement in Ethereum's price demonstrates markets' sensitivity to technical thresholds. Stakeholders closely monitor potential bullish or bearish breakouts. Increased Ethereum and Bitcoin attention influences strategic investment decisions across sectors, supported by data trends from ETF providers and on-chain analytics. Similar technical setups have driven substantial rallies post-Ethereum's updates. Historic breakouts were critical in altering market dynamics and trader sentiment. Data-driven expectations suggest consistent patterns may lead to renewed volatility. Key observations are informed by past price actions and market structure influences.

Ethereum's options market reveals a more bullish shift, with nearly 80% of July call open interest indicating a positive outlook for the asset. This bullish sentiment is further supported by the fact that Ethereum is holding above the $2,200 support level. The monthly chart for Ethereum is considered ""really nice,"" suggesting that the asset has the potential for further gains in the coming months. Bitcoin and Ethereum have also begun to respond to economic news in ways that mirror traditional assets. Reports on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), inflation, and interest rates have been shown to move prices for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. This correlation with traditional assets suggests that the crypto market is becoming more integrated with the broader financial system, and that economic indicators will continue to play a significant role in price movements for both assets.

In summary, Ethereum has shown signs of stabilization and potential for further gains, with a bullish shift in the options market and a more integrated response to economic news. The ETH/BTC ratio remains a crucial chart for traders to monitor, as it indicates Ethereum's underperformance relative to Bitcoin. However, the potential for further gains in Ethereum is supported by the asset's ability to hold above key support levels and the bullish sentiment in the options market. The Polygon network has also seen significant process success, with the Aggregate Layer v0.2 testnet live and more developers building on Polygon, indicating progress towards full cross-chain composability. The cryptocurrency community is closely watching these developments, as they could reshape expectations and drive renewed volatility in the market.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum's Resurgence: The Future of Crypto Payroll?","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/ethereum-on-chain-activity-crypto-payroll-integration","Sun, 06 Jul 2025 10:55:16 GMT","

Ethereum's recent rise in unique active addresses is more than just numbers on a screen; it's a signal that the network's clout in the decentralized finance (DeFi) arena is growing. As startups look toward crypto banking for startups, understanding Ethereum's role and its implications for regulatory compliance is essential. Let's unpack how Ethereum's bustling on-chain activity is paving the way for crypto payroll integration, the hurdles facing SMEs, and what this means for the financial landscape.

In the past week alone, Ethereum's active addresses surged to a staggering 13.2 million. This uptick hints at a fresh wave of interest in Ethereum's applications—particularly in DeFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Layer 2 solutions. An increase in active addresses suggests that users are actively exploring what the network has to offer, including options for crypto payroll for startups.

Ethereum's dominance in the DeFi space isn't just luck; it has a massive ecosystem backing it with over 165 DeFi projects. This extensive network could be a boon for startups seeking crypto payroll solutions. Smart contracts could streamline payroll processing and potentially reduce costs through blockchain payments, making Ethereum appealing to fintech startups, especially in Asia.

Ethereum's position as the primary platform for stablecoins also supports its viability for crypto payroll. Startups may utilize stablecoins to buffer against Ethereum's price volatility, ensuring employees receive stable compensation, without sacrificing the perks that blockchain technology brings.

But let's not forget scalability. As Ethereum's user base grows, the need for scalability becomes even more pressing. Ongoing development of Layer 2 solutions aims to ease congestion and lower gas fees, both of which are critical for user experience. This is crucial for Ethereum to remain competitive in the crypto banking arena, allowing startups to seamlessly adopt payroll solutions.

The Layer 2 multiplier is currently sitting at 5.04x, showing that there's substantial participation in the ecosystem. This scalability doesn't just bring new users in; it encourages them to stick around and dive deeper into what Ethereum has to offer, which could be pivotal for its long-term strength and market position.

That said, European SMEs integrating Ethereum-based solutions into their financial systems will likely face a host of regulatory hurdles. Compliance with the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework means tighter transparency and disclosure requirements, which are often daunting for smaller firms with limited resources.

On top of that, the fragmented regulatory landscape among EU member states complicates the adoption of crypto payroll solutions. Startups will need to navigate a maze of regulations, raising operational complexity and legal risks. As the regulatory landscape shifts, startups must invest in compliance measures to successfully utilize Ethereum technology.

With the recent surge in unique active addresses and the upbeat market sentiment reflected in rising open interest and funding rates, the outlook for Ethereum appears bullish. As Ethereum's price fluctuates above $2,510, traders are tuned into market fundamentals and on-chain data for more clues.

Given this interest, along with Ethereum's robust ecosystem and ongoing scalability improvements, it seems poised to maintain its position as a leader against upcoming blockchain technologies in the DeFi space. Startups eyeing crypto payroll solutions can tap into Ethereum's established infrastructure and engaged user base, marking a pathway for innovative financial solutions.

In short, Ethereum's growing user base, strong DeFi ecosystem, and scalability improvements make it an enticing option for crypto payroll integration. While regulatory challenges loom, the potential for innovation in payroll solutions is significant. As the crypto banking landscape evolves, Ethereum's on-chain activity will be key in shaping the future of financial operations for businesses around the globe.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Top analyst Michaël van de Poppe has asserted that the altcoin market is poised for a significant breakout, driven by widening undervaluation gaps across key cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Chainlink, and various DeFi blue chips. Van de Poppe, the CIO and founder of MN Trading, believes that the severe underperformance of altcoins over the past four years has created a massive opportunity for patient investors.

Van de Poppe's analysis highlights the disconnect between developer activity and falling prices, suggesting that altcoins are severely mispriced. He argues that the emotional nature of crypto markets leads to price inefficiencies, particularly in volatile assets like altcoins. These inefficiencies often result in major drawdowns followed by explosive recoveries, similar to arbitrage opportunities in traditional financial markets.

Projects like Chainlink and Wormhole illustrate this disconnect. Despite a 60% drop in Chainlink's price over the past six months, the project secured a major partnership with Mastercard, yet this news had little to no effect on its market value. Similarly, Wormhole is down 85% from its 2024 peak, even as it partners with major institutions like Ripple and BlackRock. The DeFi sector also shows substantial divergence between fundamental growth and token prices, with the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance peaking at $131 billion at the end of 2024, but key DeFi assets like Aave are down over 30–40% in value during the same period.

Ethereum is another prime example of this mispricing. Over $1 billion flowed into the Ethereum ETF in recent weeks, driven in part by expectations of staking rewards. The amount of staked ETH hit a new all-time high of 35 million, up 20% from earlier in 2024. Still, ETH's price remains 40% lower than late last year, signaling a substantial undervaluation gap. Layer-2s, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, also exhibit mispricing, with Optimism down to $0.53 from its $2 high in December, despite maintaining its position as Ethereum's leading L2. Arbitrum's TVL continues to rise even as its token slides.

Van de Poppe asserts that the ongoing mispricing in the market, caused by fear and negative sentiment, presents a strategic buying opportunity. While not all altcoins will recover, he sees clear upside in high-quality projects like Ethereum and Aave. With supply tightening, staking rewards rising, and institutional money flowing in, the stage is set for an altcoin bull run. According to Van de Poppe, the return to fair value is inevitable, and when sentiment flips, markets often overshoot to the upside. The time to build, he suggests, is now.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","‘The world supercomputer': Nexus activates final testnet for AI-ready blockchain","https://blockworks.co/news/nexus-activates-final-testnet-ai-blockchain","Sun, 06 Jul 2025 10:01:59 GMT","

Buzzwords include: succinct universal proofs, zkVM, incrementally verifiable computation, distributed supercomputer and agentic AI

Nexus modified by Blockworks

This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe.

Nexus is billing itself as “the world supercomputer.” The L1's ambitions are on full display as it churns through its final testnet ahead of mainnet launch, slated for later this year.

Anyone can join the network in a few clicks from any device, contributing compute power to help build what Nexus calls “a verifiable world.”

What is a “world supercomputer,” you might ask? It's a novel approach, according to CEO and founder Daniel Marin:

“The goal there is to build the largest distributed computer system ever, and part of the reason we're doing that is because we're trying to aggregate computing power to build a blockchain with a new architecture,” Marin told Blockworks.

Nexus combines familiar ideas from other cutting-edge chains but integrates them into a single, opinionated layer-1.

Like Mina Protocol, Nexus aims to condense all blockchain states into a single succinct proof — but while Mina uses recursive SNARKs for constant-size proofs, Nexus relies on its RISC-V-based zkVM to handle vastly more complex workloads, including AI inference. Its choice of a RISC-V zkVM is reminiscent of RISC Zero, enabling general-purpose Rust code to be proven verifiably, but Nexus makes this VM a native part of its chain, not just a service layer. Ethereum itself may eventually go in this direction.

For data availability, Nexus' planned sampling approach echoes Celestia's modular DA model, while its consensus will evolve from the current and commonly used CometBFT (formerly Tendermint) toward HotStuff-2, making it similar to Aptos or Sui. These consensus protocols provide fast finality — in Nexus' case, coordinating globally distributed proving tasks.

Nexus then bakes in a decentralized compute cloud directly into its L1, turning every connected device into part of a single, verifiable computer built around an Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC) machine. The VM generates succinct proofs for every computation step, integrates those proofs via DAG-style propagation, and aggregates them into a single Universal Proof. Nexus uses the Stwo (Circle STARK) prover.

That's a lot of buzzwords, but the TL;DR is this architecture theoretically enables horizontal scalability — each added node increases network throughput.

On the cryptography front, Nexus touts the involvement of heavyweight figures like Jens Groth and Michel Abdalla, fortifying its credentials in zero‑knowledge and blockchain research.

And it's not all theory. Last week, Nexus activated its third and final testnet, and its mainnet is targeted for Q3.

Nexus claims over 2.1 million unique users across its various testnets, backed up by Sybil detection. About 4,000 accounts are active today, Nexus' block explorer shows.

For Marin, Nexus exists to break out of blockchains' limitations “because it's impossible to build any meaningful application today.”

Marin said: “Our hypothesis from the very start of the company is that coding on a blockchain or coding on a zkVM should feel indistinguishable from coding on your own computer.” 

The protocol is optimizing for speed, not decentralization.

“We want to be decentralized in the long term, [but] we don't want to be decentralized right now at all, and in fact, pretty much the opposite,” Marin continued. “So it's a little bit of a philosophical take that will piss off some people.”

In the near term, the Nexus team is targeting quarterly releases, gunning for the trendy objective of being infrastructure for the AI era.

“We want users to feel like, ‘Wow, we're building the future. We're part of a community and a network, I can see other apps in the ecosystem, I can do quests and have fun,'” Marin said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","From being bedridden to Mohali blockchain boss","https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/bedridden-mohali-blockchain-boss-10110171/","Sun, 06 Jul 2025 15:22:32 GMT","

In 2004, while bedridden with cervical spondylitis, a young man from Mohali began what would become one of India's most resilient and future-forward tech stories. “It was an accidental startup, more of a circumstantial one,” recalls Vikram Singh, now founder and CEO of Antier Solutions, a leading blockchain company.

Singh was just 27, had no full-time college education, and a few resources to lean on. But adversity sparked entrepreneurship. The initial years were hard, he says. “The first three–five years were quite lean — but in 2009, with a core five-member team and just a month's financial back-up, the company found new momentum. Today, Antier Solutions is a 700-member strong organisation, with all operations under one roof in Mohali.”

The company's defining pivot came in 2017. “We were looking for our next growth driver. Crypto was making a lot of noise, and I was completely sold out on the secret vision behind its launch,” Singh says. That year, Antier acquired a two-kanal building and directed its entire focus towards blockchain technology.

But scaling in a Tier-2 city was far from easy. “You could not get the kind of talent you need,” Singh explains. “Even today, there's a huge void in profiles that combine Web3 with business and functional understanding. These are rare in this region, unlike Bangalore or Hyderabad.”

Instead of moving to a metro, Singh decided to build from within. Antier launched an in-house Learning & Development (L&D) division to train recruits in blockchain technology. “Ninety-five per cent of our team learned blockchain after joining us,” he says. That unit later grew into a separate entity, ASB Academy (Antier School of Blockchain), which now partners with local colleges and universities to offer blockchain education.

Singh's own journey with learning is equally unique. Born in Amritsar and raised in Mohali, he studied at a government school in Phase 3B1. He completed Class 12, followed by distance diplomas in computer applications (Kurukshetra University) and journalism (Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan). “I never went to college full-time,” he says. Yet, his belief in self-education is unshakeable.
“I've learned everything from reading,” he adds, noting he has read more than 800 books so far. “Books never have self-interest, unlike mentors sometimes.”

What sets Antier apart is that it has grown entirely organically —without venture capital or private equity. “We never had a single penny from outside investment. Banks here demand property as collateral. Investors want a major chunk of your business. The support systems just aren't there,” Singh says.

Yet he remains deeply committed to his roots. “Even today, we believe that after donating an organ, the biggest donation is the donation of a skill,” he says. The company has signed over 20 MoUs with local academic institutions and even attracts graduates from IITs and NITs, all of whom undergo blockchain training as part of their roles—technical or otherwise.

Singh is not content with just running a company. He wants to build an ecosystem. “When most entrepreneurs are done with their home, office or car, they stop. Very few try to create more leaders. But leaders aren't born — they're created through learning and conditioning.”

He's candid about the cultural gap. “Cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad had government support. We didn't. The focus here must be on upskilling local graduates. That's what we're trying to do —- make this region the blockchain capital of India.”

For Singh, success is built on a quiet but unbreakable routine. He finds peace in long walks and cycling, often with a book in hand. “That's my only companion,” he says with a smile.

Asked about stress, he replies without pause: “There's no such word in my dictionary. Depression is worrying about the past. Anxiety is worrying about the future. I believe in living in the present. If I face a problem I can't solve, I go back to books.”

He often turns to scriotures l for wisdom. He recalls five golden rules from a katha by Bhai Ram Singh: keep moving forward, expect many turns, understand the signs, carry the essentials, and never turn back. For Singh, those are as much rules for entrepreneurship as they are for life.

Reflecting on his journey, Singh says: “When you grow up somewhere, you fall in love with the place. We've seen the city grow—everything came up in front of our eyes.”
From a modest house in Mohali to leading one of the country's top blockchain firms, Vikram Singh's journey is not just a success story—it's a playbook in grit, giving back, and growing on your own terms.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Are Blockchain Residency Programs the Future of Immigration?","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/blockchain-residency-programs-global-investment","Sun, 06 Jul 2025 08:50:05 GMT","

Are Blockchain residency programs the next big thing in immigration? The concept is quite fascinating. They allow individuals to gain residency in various countries through cryptocurrency investments. This is no longer a mere concept but a tangible offering from countries looking to attract tech-savvy investors. 

What's the essence of these programs? Well, they utilize blockchain technology not just to make the application process easier, but also to enhance security and transparency. If you're into cryptocurrencies, this could be the golden ticket to your dream destination.

So how does it all come together? Generally speaking, applicants are required to stake a specific amount of cryptocurrency, often locked in a smart contract. This means that the funds are technically still under the control of the investor. For example, the Toncoin Golden Visa program in the UAE lets you secure a 10-year residency by staking $100,000 in Toncoin for three years. It's an interesting twist that might also yield annualized returns estimated between 3% and 4%. This could be a win-win situation, right?

What's in it for you? Here are some advantages that come to mind. First, the capital requirements are often lower than traditional residency-by-investment programs, which usually require hefty investments in real estate or fixed deposits. Second, since everything's on the blockchain, the processing times can be incredibly fast. For instance, the Toncoin program can finalize applications in under seven weeks, while traditional methods take three to six months. Third, you retain liquidity with your staked assets, which is a significant advantage. Traditional investments often lock your money in illiquid assets.

Finally, the programm is appealing as it doesn't require you to buy real estate or prove a minimum income to qualify. That opens the door for a more diverse pool of investors.

However, it's not all roses. What are the risks involved? The legal recognition of crypto as a valid form of investment for residency applications is still murky in many countries. This often forces applicants to convert their crypto into fiat, complicating matters. Plus, complying with AML and KYC regulations isn't always straightforward, as they require you to prove where your funds come from. This can slow down the application process.

Additionally, the lack of a consistent regulatory framework adds a layer of uncertainty for both applicants and intermediaries handling these investments. And let's not forget the classic dilemma between privacy and transparency that blockchain technology presents.

How do these programs affect traditional models? They are a clear disruptor, introducing new pathways to residency that don't require real estate investments. It lowers the entry barriers significantly. And as countries like the UAE position themselves as crypto hubs, it could very well reshape the financial landscape.

What can we learn from global examples? Vanuatu and Grenada are noteworthy, as they accept cryptocurrency as proof of income, converting it into fiat currency in the process. Switzerland and Liechtenstein have clear legal frameworks for crypto, making them attractive options. El Salvador's experiment shows that adopting crypto as legal tender is not a panacea; it requires societal trust too. 

Countries like Singapore and Estonia integrate blockchain into broader economic frameworks, which could set the stage for future developments.

If you're an investor, how can you get ready? It would be wise to enhance your digital literacy. Understanding the nuances of blockchain and cryptocurrency is crucial. Researching regulatory environments will also help you navigate potential pitfalls. Assessing the risks and returns associated with staking cryptocurrencies is another piece of the puzzle.

Finally, staying informed about developments in blockchain and residency programs will keep you ahead of the curve. It appears that blockchain residency programs are not just a flash in the pan; they might very well be the future. But do tread carefully.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Wall Street firms are increasingly investing in blockchain technology through Digital Asset, a leading institutional blockchain platform. This trend is evident in the recent investment by YZi Labs, a venture capital firm founded by former Binance CEO Changpeng (CZ) Zhao, which has invested in Digital Asset. This investment is part of a $135 million Series E funding round that includes participation from major financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs and Citadel Securities. The funding round underscores the growing interest of traditional financial firms in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize the financial industry.

The investment by YZi Labs in Digital Asset is significant as it highlights the convergence of Wall Street and blockchain technology. Digital Asset's Canton Network, a blockchain platform designed for institutional use, is at the forefront of this convergence. The platform aims to provide a secure and efficient infrastructure for financial institutions to leverage blockchain technology, enabling them to tokenize assets and streamline their operations.

The tokenization of assets is seen as a key application of blockchain technology in the financial industry. Tokenization involves using digital assets on a blockchain to represent ownership of physical property or other digital assets. This process can enhance transparency, security, and efficiency in financial transactions. By investing in Digital Asset, Wall Street firms are positioning themselves to capitalize on the benefits of tokenization and stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving financial landscape.

The investment by Wall Street firms in Digital Asset also reflects a broader trend of traditional financial institutions embracing blockchain technology. This trend is driven by the recognition that blockchain can offer significant advantages in terms of security, transparency, and efficiency. By investing in Digital Asset, these firms are not only supporting the development of blockchain technology but also ensuring that they have a stake in its future growth and success.

Changpeng Zhao has pivoted from Binance to lead YZi Labs, focusing on Web3 investments. Digital Asset, backed by firms like Goldman Sachs and Citadel, raised $135 million for the Canton Network, progressing blockchain adoption further. The integration of blockchain could enhance financial transaction transparency and efficiency. Firms may benefit from reduced costs and improved compliance through innovative asset tokenization methods.

Historical precedents, like JPMorgan's blockchain ventures, show regulated assets can indeed transition to blockchain, though challenges remain. The Canton Network may set the tone for future blockchain finance collaborations. Insights suggest continued cross-industry collaborations may drive blockchain to mainstream financial operations, fostering innovation in asset management and improving regulatory mechanisms.

The investment by YZi Labs and other Wall Street firms in Digital Asset is a clear indication of the growing interest in blockchain technology among traditional financial institutions. This trend is likely to continue as more firms recognize the potential of blockchain to transform the financial industry. The investment in Digital Asset by YZi Labs and other major financial institutions is a significant step towards the integration of blockchain technology into the mainstream financial system.

What are the latest happenings in the NFT market?

Recently, the non-fungible token (NFT) market has witnessed significant transformations with a substantial comeback. Last week's global NFT sales volume reached $128 million, an increase of 1.84% from the previous week. The statistics also show that more buyers have entered the market, along with more sellers and transactions. These trends imply a much-needed recovery of the NFT market and regained interest in this once-buzzing sector.

The data reveals that $125 million was raised globally, indicating a 10% uptick week-over-week. This upsurge exemplifies how the NFT landscape is evolving into other sectors like finance and digital ownership.

Which blockchain networks are making their mark on the NFT space?

Several blockchain networks have distinguished themselves in the current NFT market. Of these, Immutable, a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has emerged as the most-traded blockchain, with a trading sales volume totaling $36 million in the past week. Despite a 13% drop from the week before, it maintains its lead.

Next in line is Polygon, which reported a remarkable 47% increase in its sales volume to $24 million. This development notably marks a shift as Polygon has surpassed Ethereum, which in the past has reigned supreme in the NFT market. Ethereum's performance has diminished as well, with $21 million raised down 14% from last week.

Additionally, Mythos Chain saw $14 million in sales, while Bitcoin registered $11 million, a substantial 35% gain. This information showcases an evolving competition among blockchain networks in the NFT domain.

Which NFT collections are trending this week?

This week has brought significant performance from various NFT collections as well. The Guild of Guardians Heroes NFT collection has maintained its lead with $21 million in trading sales volume, despite witnessing a 10.75% decline compared to the previous week. Hot on its heels is the Courtyard NFT Collection, experiencing a 17% surge to reach $18 million. 

In addition, the DMarket NFT Collection, which comprises virtual in-game items, raised $9.1 million, while the Guild of Guardians Avatar collection raised $8.5 million, down 13%. The Gods Unchained collection, a popular trading card game, has raised $5.9 million, a 23% drop from last week. These statistics demonstrate the varied interests and trends shaping the NFT landscape.

How do rising NFT sales affect the employment sector?

The surge in NFT sales is having a major impact on fintech startups, especially in Asia, inducing them to adopt crypto payroll methods. Growing NFT sales are allowing people to become familiar with and trust digital assets, particularly in countries where the NFT market is experiencing a boom.

These financial startups are adopting crypto salary methods with systems and mechanisms for instant conversion of salary into stablecoins or regular currency. This method offers a safety net against sudden value drops while allowing employees to be compensated in cryptocurrencies.

The advent of NFTs is attracting skilled personnel valuing crypto salary options. With the growing user base of NFT enthusiasts, it becomes increasingly feasible for crypto payroll solutions to gain traction, solidifying the position of digital currencies in mainstream transactions.

What challenges do managers encounter in the NFT finance space?

Financial managers are grappling with multiple challenges when it comes to merging NFT sales figures into traditional systems of crypto accounting. One issue they regularly face is the absence of devising accounting frameworks specifically for NFTs, leading to a lack of clarity around classification and reporting. 

Additionally, the fluctuating prices of NFTs create challenges for assigning a solid base cost or fair value, complicating alignment with established accounting standards like US GAAP and IFRS.

Furthermore, the complex nature of NFT transactions creates hurdles for financial managers regarding revenue recognition and tax treatment. As regulations vary by country, adhering to tax compliance and reporting obligations becomes essential. 

The fragmented nature of wallet and exchange data promotes a lack of transaction history and cost basis tracking, necessitating specialized tools while also posing security and liquidity risks.

What do layer-2 solutions mean for businesses?

Layer-2 solutions are on the brink of converting crypto transactions for SMEs in Europe. These solutions enhance transaction speed and scalability, which is vital for enabling faster and more frequent transactions without gridlock.

Moreover, these solutions decrease transaction fees in comparison to established blockchains. The security and privacy features they offer attract enterprising companies needing to engage in sensitive transactions on blockchain networks.

Layer-2 solutions also make blockchain more engaging for business owners who aren't involved in blockchain operations, thereby helping firms enter the European markets. 

How are NFT marketplaces impacting regulatory procedures?

The advent of NFT marketplaces compels crypto companies to rethink their regulatory compliance frameworks, especially in the UAE. This nation is proactively establishing governance for digital assets like NFTs, which places added pressure on the firms to adopt VARA standards. 

However, the regulatory position around NFTs is context-dependent, as some NFTs are classified as securities based on profit generation, triggering stricter compliance protocols.

Different free zones in the UAE have competing guidelines and more stringent actions targeting these companies, forcing them to adapt their compliance approaches accordingly. 

Adaptation is key since regulatory changes are inevitable, notably driving enhanced compliance strategies that improve the security and integrity of the crypto market.

	You are here:
Influencer Marketing Hub » Influencer Marketing » NFT Campaign Metrics: How to Measure Success Beyond Floor Price

What if your NFT campaign's true performance lay not in transient floor-price movements but in the depth of community engagement and utility activation? Across our NFT drop analysis, two clear patterns emerge: brands that embed tangible perks—exclusive access, gamified experiences, and real-world events—outperform mere JPEG launches, and influencer-driven activations orchestrated around key liquidity windows sustain higher trading volumes and royalty streams.

With that in mind, marketers are asking:

This article unpacks a holistic, data-driven framework—spanning primary sale, secondary market, and community engagement—that empowers agencies and brands to measure success beyond floor price.

By aligning each KPI with targeted influencer workflows, you'll convert raw blockchain data into repeatable, scalable growth engines that drive both financial and brand-equity returns.




In influencer-powered NFT activations, ROI must be framed around three campaign stages

Each is driven by tailored influencer briefs and KPIs.

Awareness Seeding leverages tiered influencer tiers (macro, mid-tier, micro) with UTM-tagged drop links to quantify lift in mint conversion. Utility Activation tracks influencer-led redemption behaviors (e.g., token-gated event RSVPs), while Community Amplification measures how influencer-sourced audiences engage with Discord, Twitter Spaces, and secondary-market buzz.

 

Check out the How to Build Sustainable NFT Campaigns with Micro-Influencers

This tripartite framework ensures every collaboration phase—invitation, engagement, and advocacy—maps directly to measurable financial, engagement, and brand-lift outcomes, transforming nebulous floor-price chatter into structured performance insights.

In NFT campaigns, true ROI transcends mere price appreciation and encompasses a multidimensional performance matrix that aligns with broader marketing objectives. Financial ROI must integrate both primary sale proceeds and ongoing royalty revenue, ensuring that initial mint revenue is augmented by cumulative secondary-market royalties without overlooking gas-fee friction.

Equally critical is brand ROI: the degree to which NFT initiatives bolster brand equity, enhance share of voice, and generate incremental customer acquisition. Traditional floor-price fixation obscures these dimensions, incentivizing speculative trading over strategic utility.

From a marketer's perspective, utility adoption rates serve as a leading success indicator. Track the percentage of holders who redeem on-chain perks—such as access to invite-only Discord channels or token-gated virtual events—to measure the depth of engagement and predict long-tail revenue potential.

A high redemption rate often correlates with stronger community advocacy, as network participants convert digital ownership into active brand ambassadorship.

Community ROI must quantify both quantitative growth and qualitative sentiment. Leverage social-listening platforms to monitor the trajectory of Discord member counts, daily active users, and sentiment polarity.

A sustained upward trend in positive sentiment—driven by transparent roadmap updates, surprise airdrops, or organic UGC—signals robust community health and mitigates churn risk. Conversely, spikes in negative sentiment around perceived “rug pulls” or utility misfires demand rapid response via targeted AMAs or compensation strategies.

Channel ROI evaluation demands integration of on-chain analytics with off-chain engagement data. Correlate web-traffic lift from paid social ads promoting your NFT drop with on-chain mint conversion funnels. Analyze click-through rates on email blasts announcing whitelist openings, then map those clicks to mint transactions.

This convergence of Google Analytics and blockchain explorer data illuminates drop-week performance drivers and optimizes budget allocation across channels.

Brand-lift measurement rounds out the ROI framework. Conduct pre- and post-campaign brand-lift studies to assess shifts in unaided awareness, purchase intent among target segments, and net promoter score changes attributable to NFT activations. If 20% of surveyed holders report increased intent to purchase core products after minting, that uplift represents a quantifiable brand-equity gain.

By deploying this influencer-aligned ROI framework, marketers can craft briefs that specify not only aesthetic deliverables but also precise performance goals—mint targets, utility redemptions, and community-growth benchmarks—for each influencer tier.

Agencies and in-house teams gain the ability to forecast revenue from royalty streams, optimize media budgets toward channels driving on-chain actions, and present executive stakeholders with a unified dashboard that ties influencer fees directly to financial, engagement, and brand-lift KPIs.

Ultimately, this level of strategic clarity transforms NFT launches from speculative gambles into scalable, repeatable activations that reinforce long-term brand equity across emerging digital touchpoints.

 

Check out the How Influencers Are Monetizing NFTs Without Launching Their Own Collection

Successful influencer-driven mint phases require a precise “Seed & Scale” playbook. During the Seed phase, allocate 10-15% of the total supply to tiered influencer cohorts—macro influencers receive bespoke promo codes, mid-tiers share UTMs in carousel posts, and micro influencers drive community sign-ups via Discord invites.

Scale phase then unleashes broad influencer sweeps synchronized across channels, capitalizing on FOMO and social proof. To track these cohorts, leverage an influencer CRM with on-chain attribution plug-ins.

Primary sale metrics are the cornerstone of evaluating NFT campaign success, capturing the efficacy of pre-launch demand generation, mint execution, and initial revenue realization.

The first critical KPI is mint conversion rate, defined as the ratio of unique wallet visits to actual mint transactions. High conversion rates reflect seamless UX, compelling utility propositions, and well-targeted demand channels. To calculate this, integrate on-chain mint logs with front-end analytics: divide total mints by unique visits to your mint landing page.

Next, the average mint price reveals revenue optimization for tiered-utility drops. If early-bird tiers sell out within minutes at a premium price point, it demonstrates both scarcity-driven demand and willingness to pay.

Monitor how each tier performs—gold, platinum, and ultra-elite—in real time, using smart-contract event listeners. Variance in sell-out velocity across tiers helps refine future pricing structures and scarcity controls.

Sell-through rate is another indispensable metric: the percentage of total supply sold in the initial window (e.g., first 24 hours). A suboptimal sell-through signals demand fatigue or insufficient pre-drop engagement, warranting adjustments to whitelist volume, influencer seeding, or utility roadmap clarity. Brands should aim for at least 70–80% sell-through within the first 24 hours to maximize hype momentum and social proof.

Whitelist-to-mint ratio tracks the efficiency of your whitelist strategy. A high ratio means whitelist members are genuinely interested, not just chasing free spots. Low ratios may indicate over-saturation or misaligned targeting. Refining criteria—such as requiring social-proof tasks or micro-influencer referrals—can improve whitelist quality.

Gas cost optimization also impacts primary sale ROI. Monitor average gas fees paid by users during mint versus market medians. Excessive gas costs can deter conversions; consider implementing gas-station tools or layer-2 solutions to minimize friction.

Finally, capture instant secondary interest by measuring post-mint listing activity. If a significant share of newly minted NFTs are immediately relisted, that may signal short-term flips rather than long-term holder intent. While secondary flips aren't inherently negative, a balanced ratio—say, 20–30% instant relisting—indicates both liquidity provision and holder conviction.

To operationalize influencer mint referrals at scale, integrate a dedicated Influencer-Mint Module so every promo code and UTM link auto-syncs with on-chain events. Pair this with Discord Bot automations (e.g., Collab.Land) to automate whitelist allocation and real-time badge assignment for successful referrals.

For post-launch analysis, employ a unified dashboard—built in tools like Tableau or Dune Analytics—that ingests influencer cohort data, on-chain mint logs, and front-end clickstreams. This setup empowers campaign managers to identify top-performing collaborators, reallocate budget mid-campaign, and refine brief templates for future drops, closing the loop between influencer effort and primary sale performance without manual data stitching.

Secondary-market metrics are not just passive reflections of drop performance—they are actionable signals that should directly inform your influencer campaign lifecycle.

By aligning post-mint influencer activations with secondary liquidity waves, you can convert transient hype into sustained engagement and royalty revenue. This strategic alignment requires marketers to choreograph influencer content calendars—scheduling price-check videos, unboxing streams, and exclusive secondary-market AMAs—precisely when the bid–ask spread is narrowing and trading volume is poised to spike.

Embedding these activities into influencer briefs transforms secondary-market data from retrospective KPIs into forward-looking levers for budget reallocation, collaborator tiering, and real-time creative adaptation.

Measures aggregate trade value across secondary marketplaces within defined intervals (e.g., 24-, 72-, and 168-hour windows). Segment volume spikes by influencer cohort using hashed referral links embedded in secondary-listing alerts.

For example, the Nikeverse NFT collection has, at the time of writing, a +503% 24-hour trading volume on secondary marketplaces like JPG. Store (exclusive for the Cardano network). This signals a strong interest in the collection. In comparison, the AIBending NFT collection has a -50% 24-hour trading volume, signaling a decrease in interest in the collection.

Source: JPG.Store

Track net-new addresses interacting with your collection post-launch; correlate influxes with specific influencer activations (e.g., mid-tier influencer drops of unboxing clips). A rising unique-trader count indicates broadened market appeal instigated by influencer audiences.

Aggregate smart-contract royalty events to quantify revenue streams accruing to the brand or artist. Drill down royalties by marketplace (OpenSea, LooksRare) and overlay influencer-promotion timelines to identify which collaborators drive the highest royalty yield.

Monitor the divergence between low‐end listings and bid prices to evaluate market depth. Encourage influencers to publish “price-check” content during low-spread periods, incentivizing audience bids and narrowing the bid–ask gap for improved price stability.

By embedding secondary-market insights into your influencer campaign feedback loop, you gain real-time visibility into which creators catalyze the most impactful liquidity surges and royalty accruals.

This intelligence enables marketers to dynamically reallocate budgets, escalating high-performing influencers for subsequent phases, scheduling targeted “liquidity boosts,” and refining brief templates to emphasize content formats that historically drive secondary volume and stable floor prices.

Over time, this iterative approach composes a playbook of best-in-class influencer activations, ensuring that each cohort's creative output directly correlates with measurable financial and engagement outcomes, securing sustainable ROI for both primary and secondary-market performance.

In NFT campaigns powered by influencers, community engagement is the nucleus that binds holders, fuels UGC amplification, and underwrites long-term value creation. Influencer briefs must therefore go beyond transactional promotion, tasking creators with seeding tactical touchpoints like Discord deep dives, co-hosted Twitter Spaces, and UGC challenges that spotlight token utilities.

By weaving community-focused deliverables into every brief—complete with quantifiable goals and content frameworks—you ensure that each influencer activation not only broadcasts your drop but cultivates the sustained human connections critical for retention, advocacy, and secondary-market vibrancy.

Monitor growth in target channels—Discord, Telegram, Twitter Spaces—attributable to influencer referrals. Use invite-specific links or Discord bots that track sign-ups by collaborator. A vibrant, expanding community indicates successful influencer conversion of audiences into engaged holders.

Calculate the ratio of returning participants to new joiners in your primary community channels over 7- and 14-day cohorts. Overlay these cohorts with influencer activation dates to determine which creators foster stickiness and drive repeat interactions (polls, drop predictions, utility redemptions).

Assess participation in token-gated events—both virtual and IRL—by measuring RSVP-to-attendance ratios and post-event feedback volumes. Leverage on-chain proof-of-attendance to quantify how many holders (sourced via influencer campaigns) engage with branded experiences, reinforcing utility as a retention lever.

When community metrics are surfaced alongside influencer performance data in a centralized dashboard, marketers can precisely identify which creators excel at community stimulation, whether through high RSVP conversion, peak AMA engagement, or superior retention cohorts.

This clarity allows you to iterate on brief structures—reallocating resources to influencers whose content fosters the deepest connections, co-developing new utility-driven UGC campaigns, and designing phased activations that build progressively richer community experiences.

Ultimately, this data-informed approach transforms community engagement from a soft metric into a strategic asset, driving higher mint conversions, increased royalty streams, and enduring brand loyalty within your NFT ecosystem.

On-site and off-chain engagement metrics illuminate the precise touchpoints where creator audiences interact with brand assets, bridging the gap between social buzz and on-chain action.

By integrating UTM-tracked links in influencer content, marketers can dissect every stage of the conversion funnel: from click-through on a mint announcement, through exploratory roadmap page visits, to wallet-connect attempts.

Concurrently, off-chain signals—email open rates, site dwell time, and social share velocity—serve as early-warning indicators of friction or hype fatigue. Embedding these metrics into influencer briefs empowers teams to optimize content timing, refine targeting layers, and allocate media dollars toward channels that demonstrably drive on-chain conversions.

Deploy granular UTM parameters in every influencer asset—story swipe-ups, link-in-bio posts, and affiliate deposit prompts—to map conversion paths from specific creators to mint page visits. Combine these with real-time dashboards (e.g., Segment + Dune integration) to attribute mint transactions back to influencer cohorts and adjust brief tactics mid-campaign.

Monitor key behavioral metrics on your mint landing page: time on page, scroll depth (e.g., roadmap engagement), and click-map heat zones. Influencer briefs should include A/B testing of hero creative and utility explainer placement, with predetermined thresholds (e.g., 60% scroll depth) that trigger rapid creative swaps or link refinements.

Embed influencer-exclusive promo codes in drip sequences sent to pre-signup audiences. Track open rates, click-through rates, and subsequent wallet connections to gauge influencer content resonance. High open-to-mint conversion signals that creator messaging aligns with audience intent, informing future brief messaging hierarchies.

Use social listening tools (Brandwatch, Sprout Social) to quantify share counts, hashtag mentions, and engagement velocity for influencer-generated content. Correlate peaks in virality velocity with on-site conversion spikes to identify which narrative angles—utility demos, unboxings, AMAs—best drive cross-channel amplification.

By systematically linking UTM-tagged influencer posts, on-site behavioral analytics, and off-chain engagement signals to on-chain mint actions, marketers gain a closed-loop view of campaign performance.

This empowers rapid iteration of influencer briefs—shifting focus to top-performing content formats, optimizing call-to-action placement, and reallocating budget to creators whose audiences demonstrate the strongest funnel progression.

Over successive drops, this data-driven methodology delivers compounding ROI by fine-tuning targeting precision, creative sequencing, and cross-channel amplification tactics—transforming ephemeral hype into a sustainable growth engine.

NFT drop success demands more than fleeting floor-price spikes. By integrating primary-sale, secondary-market, community, on-site/off-chain, and brand-lift metrics into a unified framework, marketers convert raw data into strategic insights.

Each KPI—mint conversion rate, royalty yield, Discord retention, UTM attribution, and sentiment lift—serves as a directional beacon for refining influencer briefs, reallocating budgets, and optimizing creative cadences. This closed-loop methodology transforms your creator network into a living growth engine, capable of sustaining engagement, amplifying brand equity, and unlocking ongoing revenue streams.

As you iterate, the playbook of best-in-class activations emerges: tiered collaborator models, timed content surges, and utility-driven UGC challenges. Ultimately, this disciplined, data-driven approach elevates NFT campaigns from speculative drops to repeatable, scalable marketing vehicles—bridging emerging Web3 channels with proven influencer-marketing rigor and delivering measurable ROI for agencies and brands alike.

Consider a turnkey solution like the NFT Makers suite, which offers built-in analytics for mint conversion rate, gas-fee tracking, and UTM-tag integration—letting you attribute primary-sale performance directly to specific influencer cohorts.

Leverage analytics from leading Sport NFT Marketplaces that report trading volume by team or player collection, enabling you to correlate post-mint influencer activations with spikes in bid–ask spread and total trade value.

Platforms like the NFT Marketplace guide highlight marketplaces—OpenSea, Rarible, LooksRare—with on-chain dashboards and webhook integrations to feed your BI tools and track both primary and secondary KPIs in real time.

Integrating NFT Domains into your campaign—by issuing token-gated subdomains for whitelist access—lets you track unique visits, badge redemptions, and utility activation tied to each influencer's referral link.

Using an NFT Collection Generator accelerates batch mint workflows and standardizes metadata, while built-in CSV export of token IDs lets you map mints back to specific influencer promo codes for cohort-level conversion analysis.

Real-estate NFT Companies often include on-chain deeds or virtual walkthrough access; you track RSVP-to-attendance ratios and token-gated property views as utility redemption rates—providing deeper holder-engagement insights than pure token transfers.

On NFT Games, measure in-game asset usage, level-completion rates, and secondary trades of game NFTs—then align those with influencer UGC streams to identify which creators drive the highest play-to-earn conversion.

Platforms like the Music NFT Marketplace provide royalty-split reports and listener engagement stats, enabling you to correlate influencer-led drop announcements with spikes in play counts, secondary sales, and resulting royalty income.

Influencer Marketing Hub » Influencer Marketing » How Influencers Are Driving NFT FOMO—and When It Backfires

TikTok's fast-paced environment has become the epicenter for NFT hype, but with skyrocketing floor prices and “to the moon” mantras come critical questions:

Recent patterns reveal a two-pronged trend—short-form creators weaponize real-time price alerts and third-party sentiment indices to fuel instant mint velocity, while gated Discord and Telegram channels create an echo chamber that amplifies scarcity signals.

As marketers at agencies and in-house teams map out influencer collaboration blueprints, understanding these mechanics—and the precise failure modes—becomes essential.

This article dissects the strategic levers behind TikTok-driven NFT FOMO, exposes the cracks where campaigns backfire, and equips you with the operational frameworks to convert fleeting hype into resilient brand advocacy.




Marketers must recognize that FOMO is not a byproduct of hype alone but the calculated result of layered emotional triggers and algorithmic reinforcement. At its core, FOMO exploits the scarcity principle: limited-time drops and capped NFT mint supplies signal exclusivity, causing audiences to assign disproportionate value to what feels rare.

What does #FOMO mean? 👀 Let's find out together! 🚀 #glossary #glossarytok #web3crypto #web3game #nftita #nftitalia #foryou #fy #fyp #perte #neiperte #fypage #fynft #nft #blockchain #web3 #crypto #cryptocurrency #cryptok #edutok #education #edutokmotivation #edutech #tech #techtok #nftcommunity #nftgame #nfttok

Psychological studies show that consumers confronted with scarcity perceive items as more desirable, and TikTok influencers lean into this by emphasizing countdowns and highlighting surges in search and sentiment metrics.

On TikTok, the recommendation engine amplifies FOMO by promoting content with high engagement velocity. Videos tagged with trending sounds or NFT-related hashtags rapidly accumulate views, creating the optical illusion of mass participation. For agency marketers, this means that organic reach becomes a metric not just of content quality but of perceived urgency—videos that show wallets minting NFTs in real time or price charts ticking upward can trigger algorithmic boosts.

Understanding each video's “For You” performance curve allows planners to schedule teaser drops at peak times, ensuring each clip lands when audience attention and platform weighting align.

Beyond the platform mechanics, FOMO is amplified by referencing third-party sentiment indicators. The “Fear & Greed Index,” for instance, is repeatedly cited by influencers as a proxy for market sentiment—when the index creeps into “greed” territory, influencers frame it as both a signal to buy and a warning to act quickly.

This Fear and Greed Index has been incredibly correlated with market tops and bottoms going back to 2021. I break it down in this video! #fearandgreed #crypto #fyp

For brands, integrating live updates of such indices into campaign dashboards can inform split-second decisions on content pacing, ad spend ramp-ups, or influencer prompts. Meanwhile, monitoring real-time search volume spikes across TikTok, Google Trends, and on-chain analytics can validate whether the community is in a fear-driven accumulation phase or at risk of a peak-induced sell-off.

Finally, FOMO thrives in environments where ambiguity and uncertainty prevail. TikTok's short-form video format limits explanation depth, so influencers deploy cognitive shortcuts—like “ape in” language or “to the moon” slogans—that resonate emotionally.

Marketers should counterbalance these shortcuts with clear, concise risk disclosures embedded within captions or in-video text overlays. By combining urgency cues (e.g., “Mint window closes in 2 hours”) with brief reminders of price volatility, brands can harness FOMO-driven volume surges without eroding long-term brand credibility.

To operationalize these insights, integrate a “FOMO Metrics” module into every influencer brief, defining target triggers (e.g., Fear & Greed Index threshold, engagement velocity benchmarks, mint countdown milestones) and mapping them to content deliverables and paid media boosts.

Use tools like CreatorIQ or Tagger to automate sentiment tracking and tie real‐time FOMO signals back into your campaign dashboard. This ensures that both creative assets and activation schedules are dynamically aligned to market sentiment, maximizing both reach and conversion while safeguarding brand credibility under peak hype conditions.

Leading TikTok creators deploy a tactical playbook to ignite FOMO: from real-time price alerts to gated community invitations and IRL activations.

Influencers will spotlight intraday NFT floor-price jumps—sometimes overlaying live on-screen charts—to create social proof at scale. These clips often include direct CTAs (“link in bio to mint before it pumps 20% more”), turning engagement into immediate action.

Agency teams should track which content angles (e.g., technical analysis vs. drop countdowns) yield the highest conversion rates, then replicate those templates across both paid partnerships and owned channels.

Our data analysis highlights Discord and Telegram as the go-to channels for peer validation. By positioning these servers as “free feedback loops” where high-intensity discussions happen, influencers reinforce that missing access equates to missed alpha.

Agencies can collaborate with influencers to embed co-branded welcome sequences in these chats—automated drip messages that feed users exclusive sneak peeks or early whitelist codes. This creates a layered funnel: TikTok video → gated chat → high-intent mint page.

The Board 8 anecdote illustrates how simple “real-world” activations could have ameliorated reputational backlash. Brands should follow up digital drops with localized, low-barrier experiences—pop-up art shows, café meet-ups, or co-branded lounges—where holders can tangibly interact.

Even small-scale activations work: photo-op NFT art walls, limited-edition merchandise handouts, or expert AMA panels. When executed flawlessly, these events transform passive holders into vocal advocates, amplifying FOMO within their own networks.

Influencers often pivot to “troll tokens” or one-day meme drops, creating a sense of “must-ape” immediacy. Brands must resist purely speculative angles but can replicate the momentum by commissioning limited-run utility tokens—coupled with product discounts or loyalty perks—that align with brand value.

By structuring these drops around well-defined utility (e.g., VIP webinar access, future airdrops) rather than pure price speculation, marketers can harness meme-driven energy without succumbing to pump-and-dump stigma.

To cement these tactics into a replicable campaign blueprint, update your influencer brief template with dedicated sections for “Community Activation,” “IRL Engagement,” and “Meme-Drop Utility.”

Specify clear KPIs—such as Discord-to-Mint conversion rates, event RSVP vs. attendance metrics, and token utility redemption figures—and assign tracking responsibilities (e.g., campaign manager, social analyst).

Utilize project management tools like Asana or Trello with these sections pre-populated, ensuring each influencer's collaboration adheres to the same rigorous operational standards. This structured approach not only amplifies short-term mint velocity but also builds lasting community trust, driving both immediate FOMO and sustained brand advocacy.

FOMO campaigns without guardrails can trigger swift community backlash and reputational harm:

To preempt and manage FOMO-driven backlash, integrate a “Backlash Response Protocol” into your influencer campaign operations.

This proactive structure not only mitigates fallout but also frames transparent responses as trust-building moments, converting potential backlash into community advocacy.

Brands must evolve beyond pure hype to construct FOMO-driven campaigns underpinned by clear guardrails and educational value.

In practical terms, update your influencer brief template with a “Responsible FOMO Checklist” sidebar featuring five action items:

Leverage project management platforms like Notion or Airtable to automate these checklist items as toggles that lock deliverables until approved. This surgical integration ensures that every influencer collaboration—from micro-creators to high-profile partners—is both high-impact and high-integrity, safeguarding brand equity while maximizing FOMO-driven engagement.

Begin with a 3-phase creative brief:

In “Narrative Hook,” specify targeted emotional triggers-scarcity (“Only 500 mint slots”), urgency (“24-hour window”)—and require influencers to script a 5-second teaser emphasizing these levers.

In “Value Justification,” define educational micro-moments: ask creators to cite live sentiment indices or historical floor-price inflection points, adding credibility.

In “Risk Boundary,” include a bulletized glossary of key terms (e.g., “floor price,” “whitelist,” “greed index”) and a call-out to a hosted explainer video, ensuring audiences gain context alongside excitement.

Deploy a Launch Sequence Grid mapping 6-8 influencer posts across T-minus 48h to T-plus 72h. Tier access by wallet loyalty: early-access holders receive an exclusive mint code 12 hours before public drop; secondary holders gain social-only perks.

Integrate a Community Moderation Roster into briefs, assigning each influencer two vetted Discord moderators who follow a standardized engagement script—answering FAQs, cross-posting highlights to a central “Hype Tracker” channel, and escalating red-flag sentiment to brand teams.

After the mint window, guide influencers to host “Utility Unlocked” livestreams, demonstrating secondary-market features, governance proposals, or roadmap milestones. Each post-launch brief should include instructions for a Holder Satisfaction Survey built in Typeform, with live results feeding back into a shared analytics dashboard.

Schedule a “Month-End Performance Sync” where influencer partners review 4 KPIs—secondary-market volume, sentiment delta, event attendance, and Discord retention—aligning next-cycle objectives.

To operationalize these steps, incorporate a three-tab Airtable base linked directly in every influencer brief:

Grant view-only access to creator partners for transparency, and assign brand and agency teams edit permissions. This centralized documentation ensures that strategic phases—Pre-Launch Teasers, Launch Execution, and Post-Launch Optimization—are visible, measurable, and easily iterated upon for future NFT campaigns.

By weaving urgency with clear guardrails and strategic follow-through, brands can harness TikTok-driven FOMO to deliver both explosive mint velocity and durable community loyalty. A robust influencer brief—complete with FOMO metrics modules, responsible disclosure checklists, and post-launch feedback loops—ensures every creator collaboration balances excitement with education.

Real-time sentiment monitoring and rapid response playbooks prevent hype from spiraling into backlash, while tiered utility events and holder surveys transform one-off buyers into vocal advocates. Ultimately, FOMO campaigns that embed transparency, risk-mitigation, and structured debriefs not only maximize short-term conversions but also build sustainable ecosystems around your NFT drops.

For agency strategists and in-house marketers alike, this integrated approach is the blueprint for converting fleeting hype into long-term brand equity—and turning every moment of fear of missing out into an opportunity for deeper customer advocacy.

Many marketers turn to turnkey solutions like the NFT collection generator to launch cohesive drops without deep technical resources, or they partner with specialized NFT marketplaces that handle minting and secondary-market listing.

Music creators amplify scarcity by releasing limited-edition tokenized tracks on a music NFT marketplace, then use TikTok teasers to drive anticipation and redirect fans to whitelist opportunities.

Top adopters include both crypto-native creators and mainstream voices; consulting a list of top NFT creators helps brands identify influencers whose audiences already engage with digital collectibles.

Securing NFT domains lets brands build on-chain landing pages (e.g., “yourbrand.eth”) that creators can link in TikTok bios, reinforcing authenticity and driving direct traffic.

Clubs release tokenized collectibles—player cards or match highlights—via a dedicated sport NFT marketplace and enlist TikTok creators to debut “first-look” unboxing videos that spike mint demand.

If design flexibility and rapid iteration are priorities, in-house teams can spin up assets with an NFT maker tool; otherwise, co-branding with established marketplaces accelerates launch timelines.

By integrating utility—such as in-game assets redeemable in popular NFT games—and collaborating with gaming influencers who showcase true gameplay value, marketers balance hype with substance.

Real-estate platforms now tokenize metaverse parcels through NFT real estate companies, enabling brands to host immersive events that influencers can preview, driving FOMO for virtual attendance passes.

Brands seeking tight creative control and unique art drops often partner with an NFT collection generator to tailor attributes, while companies focused on speed-to-market may opt for existing marketplace templates.

Influencer Marketing Hub » Creator Economy » Influencer Marketing for Generative Art NFTs: What Makes It Work

As generative art moves from niche experimentation to mainstream NFT marketplaces, two questions dominate brand strategy:

Recent trends reveal that top creators lead with educational, tutorial-style walkthroughs—demystifying blockchain-embedded scripts—while orchestrating live minting countdowns that drive FOMO and real-time participation. We're also seeing a pattern of co-creation partnerships, where influencers contribute palette or parameter inputs, and robust compliance playbooks that safeguard brand trust across sponsored content.

Data-integrated media kits and real-time dashboards round out the playbook, enabling rapid performance pivots based on on-chain and social metrics.

This article unpacks the operational frameworks, phased tactics, and measurement protocols that empower agencies and in-house teams to turn generative art drops into replicable, high-velocity activations—delivering sustainable community growth and repeatable ROI.




To leverage generative art NFTs in influencer-driven campaigns, marketing teams must align technical pillars with clear operational frameworks. Integrating immutable scripts and unpredictable reveal mechanics into structured influencer briefs enables agencies to translate algorithmic novelty into campaign milestones—mint windows, community engagement triggers, and tiered reward systems.

This orientation bridges art mechanics with the tactical playbooks influencers need to execute high-impact drops.

From a marketing perspective, this automated unpredictability is a powerful narrative lever. When agencies craft briefs for generative art campaigns, they must foreground the provable uniqueness of each mint.

The blockchain-embedded script—immutable by design—serves as both proof of authenticity and a guaranteed audit trail, addressing collector concerns around provenance. By emphasizing that “the script itself cannot be altered post-deployment,” brands reinforce trust, tapping into the same psychological drivers that underpin luxury authentication (e.g., serial-numbered production runs).

Moreover, the minting interaction becomes an engagement touchpoint. Because no party knows the final image until the transaction confirms, each collector experiences a “reveal moment” that mirrors unboxing experiences in direct-to-consumer campaigns.

Marketers should treat mint events like product launches, with countdown sequences, teaser visuals of algorithm parameters, and post-mint showcases of rare traits. Highlighting “flow field algorithms producing organic curves” and “probability-based variations in color palette, scale, and margins” enriches positioning, aligning technical details with the audience's fascination for algorithmic art.

From an agency standpoint, aligning generative art drops with broader social initiatives or brand narratives requires intact technical fidelity. Every marketing asset—from one-pagers to media kits—should include clear diagrams of the generative process, screenshots of script snippets, and non-technical summaries of how blockchain immutability guarantees authenticity.

This level of transparency not only satisfies due diligence but also empowers brand stakeholders to approve campaigns with confidence.

Lastly, generative art's inherent diversity of outputs demands a community-centric rollout. Marketers must plan for secondary-market communication, tracking which algorithmic variants resonate most, and resharing collector-generated content.

By integrating NFT mint analytics into CRM systems and retargeting ads to collectors who minted specific trait combinations, agencies can sustain post-launch momentum and iterate on future generative parameters.

By embedding these technical insights into influencer briefs, agencies can calibrate campaign phases around mint milestones—triggering teaser posts at T-minus 48 hours, deploying trait-spotlight content mid-launch, and orchestrating live recap streams post-mint. This framework secures consistent engagement velocity and optimizes conversion funnels.

Moreover, influencer performance metrics (e.g., mint-link click-through, Discord join rate) feed back into real-time dashboards, enabling rapid amplification or course correction. Integrating generative mechanics with structured campaign operations ensures that every influencer touchpoint—from unboxing-style reveal videos to rarity-spotlight threads—delivers measurable ROI against clearly defined KPIs.

Influencers serve as indispensable intermediaries between abstract generative art projects and target audiences, translating code complexity into compelling narratives that drive collector action.

When marketing teams for agencies brief influencers on a generative art drop, they must recognize three core influencer functions: educator, community architect, and authenticity beacon.

To operationalize these roles, agencies should construct an Influencer Brief Framework comprising three layers:

This layered brief ensures that influencers are equipped with precise campaign mechanics, clear creative boundaries, and quantifiable KPIs—transforming abstract art drops into coordinated, data-driven influencer activations.

An influencer's ability to translate technical jargon into accessible insights directly impacts campaign reach. By opening with “If you're unfamiliar with generative art, this TikTok is for you,” creators establish broad-based appeal, onboarding novices without alienating enthusiasts.

Marketers should empower influencers with concise talking points—e.g., “immutable script on-chain” or “probability-weighted trait generation”—paired with simple analogies (like unboxing). This dual strategy elevates perceived value while minimizing drop-off in comprehension.

Generative drops thrive on network effects. Influencers leverage Discord servers, Twitter Spaces, and TikTok comment threads to coalesce collectors around shared excitement. By inviting audience input—Q&A sessions on algorithm parameters or polls on preferred color palettes—influencers transform passive viewers into active stakeholders.

Agencies should design influencer toolkits that include community engagement playbooks: scheduled AMA slots, branded channel graphics, and templated “mint milestone” announcements to sustain momentum before, during, and after launch.

In saturated NFT markets, authenticity is a differentiator. Influencers succeed when they model genuine vulnerability—sharing their creative journey, challenges, and personal takeaways. Brands must resist scripting overly polished influencer content; instead, provide framework briefs that highlight key messages (e.g., algorithm novelty, scarcity parameters) but allow influencers to weave in their own experiences with generative art.

This humanizes abstract drops and fosters trust, which is critical for higher funnel engagement and conversion.

Embedding this structured brief framework accelerates campaign consistency and scale: influencer onboarding time shrinks, content approval cycles drop, and mint velocity peaks. This precision ensures that every influencer post aligns with on-chain momentum, fueling higher floor price stabilization and stronger secondary-trade activity.

Marketers can duplicate the framework across multiple drops, evolving parameters based on real-time analytics and feedback, ultimately establishing a repeatable engine for generative art NFT success.

To maximize collector activation at every stage, align each tactic with distinct campaign phases:

Integrate these formats directly into influencer briefs with clear timing triggers and performance benchmarks. A phase-based playbook ensures that countdown mechanics feed mint-day urgency, tutorial content educates during peak interest, affiliate guides extend conversion windows, and co-creation campaigns sustain momentum.

By embedding this sequencing into briefs, agencies deliver influencers a structured roadmap—complete with calendar slots, asset templates, and KPI targets—turning ad-hoc content into a cohesive, high-velocity launch engine.

Structuring a live mint event transforms passive drops into interactive launches. Agencies should integrate influencer-driven countdown assets—customized timers in Instagram Stories or TikTok Lives that synchronize across all creator channels.

Embed a dynamic mint-widget overlay (via the Art Blocks or OpenSea drop API) so influencers can stream real-time transaction feeds, showcasing mint velocity and rare trait revelations as they occur. This tactic creates FOMO-driven urgency and amplifies shareability: each on-chain milestone triggers an automated social push (Discord webhook → influencer ping → 30-second celebratory clip).

Deep-dive walkthroughs anchor technical intricacies in digestible formats. Equip influencers with a “feature matrix” slide deck that highlights rarity tiers, color-code trait probabilities, and shows behind-the-scenes code snippet screenshots.

They can repurpose these into bite-sized vertical videos: a step-by-step mint tutorial, an algorithm explainer, or a “rare trait hunting” unboxing. Use Stories polls (“Which trait is rarest?”) and live Q&A sessions to drive two-way dialogue. Embedding short UTM-tagged links within tutorial captions enables precise tracking of conversion lift per content segment.

Agencies can monetize influencer activations via affiliate referral codes—ideally managed through programmable marketplaces like Impact.com or PartnerStack. Influencers deploy unique mint-link parameters; dashboards automatically attribute on-chain purchases to each creator. Complement this with a co-branded “Generative Art NFT Resource Guide” PDF (hosted on Google Drive or Discord), featuring step-by-step setup, glossary of terms, and direct referral links to mint platforms.

This resource anchors post-launch engagement, extending the touchpoint lifecycle and generating warmed-up leads for subsequent drops.

Elevate NFT influencer partnerships by embedding creators into the generative process itself. Agencies can allocate “influencer algorithm slots” where top-tier creators supply input on palette ranges or parameter constraints. This co-creation narrative—“co-designed by X influencer”—becomes a promotional pillar, amplifying personal stake and community advocacy.

To operationalize, include “parameter contribution” milestones in the brief, co-host ideation sessions via Zoom, and document the storyboard in a shared Miro board. Post-launch, release a limited batch of “influencer-curated” NFTs at a premium tier, rewarding both influencer audiences and early-adopter collectors.

When these tactics are sequenced against a detailed campaign calendar and embedded within influencer briefs, marketing teams achieve synchronized content velocity and measurable lift at each phase.

Effective authenticity and compliance rest on a three-tiered framework embedded directly into influencer briefs:

By operationalizing compliance through these tiers, agencies prevent costly post-launch corrections, protect brand equity, and maintain seamless collaboration with influencers.

Non-negotiable compliance begins with transparent disclosures. Influencers must use clear, unambiguous disclosures (“#Ad,” “Sponsored”) at the start of every mint-promotion post—whether in TikTok captions or YouTube descriptions—to adhere to the FTC's real-time endorsement rule.

Agencies should integrate a compliance checklist into every influencer contract: required hashtag placements, call-out font size minimums for Instagram Stories (per Nielsen media-compliance standards), and logging timestamps of live endorsements. Utilize automated compliance monitoring tools (e.g., ComplyAdvantage's Social Media Monitor) to flag missing disclosures pre-publish.

Recently, the FTC updated the guidelines for content creators and influencers about how they are legally obligated to disclose partnerships - And they kinda didn't really tell anyone 😂 Our friend Lindsey Gamble gave us the tea on his blog (ascreenshotted here). Here's the video I was referring to: #contentcreators2023 #brandpartnershiptips #brandcollabtips

Overpromising damages long-term credibility and undermines collector trust. Structured brief language should mandate “focus on educational takeaways” over unsubstantiated performance claims.

Instead of “this will be the next multi-million-dollar drop,” influencers emphasize “this algorithmic reveal process creates verifiable scarcity.” Agencies can enforce a “claim-review” workflow using Google Forms: every headline or on-cam claim is submitted to legal and data teams for factual validation before go-live.

This ensures hype remains grounded in verifiable mechanics, protecting brand equity and preventing post-launch backlash.

 

Check out the Legal Must-Haves for Influencer Briefs from Usage Rights to FTC Lines

Leverage verifiable on-chain metrics to bolster authenticity. When an influencer highlights “only 999 outputs minted on Art Blocks,” include a clickable verification link to the smart contract on Etherscan.

Embedding these live-data trust signals within influencer content not only educates but also demonstrates brand transparency. Agencies should create a standardized “Trust Signal Kit”—consisting of pre-formatted contract links, rarity dashboards, and live price-tracker widgets—that influencers can drop into posts or Stories with one-click ease.

Authenticity extends beyond launch day. Set up automated sentiment analysis on influencer channels and NFT marketplaces (using tools like Brandwatch or Sprout Social) to surface negative feedback, be it confusion around mint mechanics or disclosure oversights.

When issues arise, orchestrate coordinated influencer responses: template apology/disclaimer scripts in brief; a follow-up educational livestream; and a pinned FAQ in Discord. This real-time corrective playbook ensures brand and influencer reputations remain aligned and resilient.

Embedding this compliance framework into every influencer brief not only safeguards brands from regulatory penalties but also amplifies campaign effectiveness. Ultimately, compliance-driven authenticity is not just a legal necessity—it's a competitive advantage that fortifies brand trust, maximizes influencer ROI, and underpins sustainable community growth.

To transform generative art NFT activations into scalable influencer-led programs, teams must embed measurement and media-kit deliverables directly into influencer briefs and governance workflows.

Establish a centralized campaign dashboard that aggregates on-chain events, social performance, and creative asset status, updating via API connectors to Looker Studio or Supermetrics.

Specify in every brief the required data hooks (e.g., UTM parameters, webhook endpoints, contract addresses) and designate cadence-call checkpoints for performance reviews. This ensures real-time visibility across stakeholders—creative, media, legal—and aligns every phase of the campaign with actionable insights.

Every influencer collaboration requires a cohesive media kit that blends brand narrative with on-chain data:

Integrate an influencer management platform (e.g., Upfluence or GRIN) with blockchain event APIs to automate attribution: each minted NFT is tagged to an influencer's referral code, feeding directly into a centralized reporting dashboard. This real-time visibility allows teams to reallocate paid budget toward top-performing creators within minutes of launch.

Embedding quantitative benchmarks into media kits—and reviewing them in cadence calls—ensures campaigns deliver predictable ROI. For example, establish a “5% mint-link CTR threshold” for influencer content; if underperforming, deploy an experimental tutorial push or additional countdown Live session.

This closed-loop measurement transforms generative art drops from speculative activations into data-driven growth engines.

Bridging the gap between algorithmic innovation and human connection is essential for generative art NFT campaign success. By embedding clear measurement frameworks, phase-aligned tactics, and robust compliance protocols into influencer briefs, agencies can transform every influencer touchpoint into a data-driven activation.

Dynamic media kits and real-time dashboards ensure stakeholders stay aligned, while outcome-driven playbooks enable rapid optimization based on on-chain and social signals. This structured approach not only amplifies mint-day momentum but also cultivates long-term community engagement and secondary-market resilience.

As generative art NFTs evolve, the most successful brands will be those that marry technical authenticity with strategic influencer operations, turning each drop into a high-velocity growth engine and a replicable playbook for future activations. By operationalizing these core pillars, marketers unlock sustainable ROI and position their brands at the forefront of the next wave in digital art innovation.

Many creators start with no-code solutions like NFT Makers to automate minting processes and integrate metadata schemas, allowing influencers to focus on storytelling rather than technical setup.

Partnering with a dedicated sport NFT marketplace lets influencers leverage fandom-driven engagement—sharing drop calendars and behind-the-scenes athlete content to ignite pre-mint excitement.

Owning a branded NFT domain enables influencers to host drop previews and giveaways on a memorable URL, boosting click-through rates and reinforcing brand authority.

Yes—by showcasing property concepts as part of a limited NFT real estate companies drop, influencers can drive lead capture through exclusive virtual tours embedded in token metadata.

Using an NFT collection generator lets agencies automate attribute rarity and batch-upload visuals, freeing influencers to create promotional content instead of manual uploads.

Integrating with NFT games allows influencers to livestream mint-to-play experiences, turning passive viewers into active participants within a branded metaverse.

On a music NFT marketplace, influencers can co-host virtual listening parties tied to token drops, driving both secondary-market trading and fan loyalty.

Creating dedicated NFT Telegram groups enables influencers to share real-time mint alerts and gated airdrop links, fostering high-intent engagement ahead of public launches.

Oops, something went wrong

A simple question posted on Reddit recently sparked one of the most revealing debates about Bitcoin's future: “If only 5% of the population owns BTC, what is the use case?” The post, which garnered hundreds of responses, exposed a fundamental tension that's been brewing in the crypto space for years.

The original poster laid out the problem starkly: “So, if 19 million bitcoin are presently ‘minted' and only 4% of the population are holders... What good is a ‘currency' that only 5% of the population owns???”

It's a fair question that cuts to the heart of Bitcoin's identity crisis—and the answer reveals why Bitcoin might be succeeding precisely because it's failing as a traditional currency.

The debate immediately split into two camps, each with a fundamentally different vision of what Bitcoin should be.

The “Electronic Cash” Purists point to Satoshi Nakamoto's original white paper, titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” As one commenter put it: “Bitcoin is explicitly designed to function as peer-to-peer electronic cash. That's literally the title.”

The “Digital Gold” Advocates argue that Bitcoin has evolved beyond its original purpose. “Bitcoin is NOT a currency,” wrote one user. “It is not designed to be used as a payment vehicle... It is designed to be a safe harbor for your money while your government ruins your fiat.”

This isn't just an academic debate—it reveals a profound shift in how Bitcoin is being positioned and used in the real world.

The most compelling counterargument to the “5% problem” comes from an unexpected source: precious metals.

“What percentage of the population owns gold?” multiple commenters asked. The comparison is illuminating. Gold isn't widely used for daily transactions, yet it maintains value as a store of wealth. Similarly, Bitcoin supporters argue that widespread ownership isn't necessary for utility.

“I don't own gold so that I can take it to Walmart to buy a TV,” one user explained. “I own gold because its supply cannot be inflated like fiat currency, therefore its value will increase.”

But critics push back on this analogy. Gold has industrial uses, cultural significance, and thousands of years of history. Bitcoin has... math.

Perhaps the most telling response to the adoption question was the collective refrain: “We're early.”

This phrase, repeated throughout the thread, represents more than just optimism—it's a fundamental belief that Bitcoin adoption follows a different trajectory than traditional currencies or payment systems.

“Adoption isn't linear, it's exponential!” one commenter declared. “We're still early. And early always looks confusing. Until it's obvious.”

The “early” narrative draws parallels to the internet's adoption curve, credit card acceptance, or even gold's historical role. Supporters argue that Bitcoin's current 5% ownership rate is actually impressive for a 15-year-old technology challenging millennia-old monetary systems.

The most damning criticism in the thread came from users who see Bitcoin as pure speculation.

“Bitcoin, like all cryptocurrencies, is best understood as a collectible asset,” wrote one skeptic. “Its value is not tied to any underlying cash flows... What gives it value is belief and shared conviction that it's scarce, desirable, and that someone else in the future will likely pay more for it.”

This perspective frames Bitcoin not as a currency or even a store of value, but as a digital collectible whose worth depends entirely on the greater fool theory—the hope that someone else will pay more for it later.

Even some Bitcoin supporters acknowledged this tension. “I still have yet to meet or see someone pay with bitcoin. It's always from an investment perspective,” one user admitted.

The discussion revealed an uncomfortable truth: Bitcoin's current infrastructure doesn't support widespread adoption as a currency. At roughly 3 transactions per second, the network would allow each person on Earth to make one Bitcoin transaction every 3.5 years.

“In its current state, everyday purchases with bitcoin is akin to going to a secure bank vault just to withdraw 5 dollars for a coffee,” one user noted.

Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network are supposed to address these scaling issues, but they remain largely theoretical for most users.

The Reddit debate reveals three key insights for anyone considering Bitcoin:

1. Bitcoin's Value Proposition Is Evolving Whether you see this as a natural evolution or a betrayal of Bitcoin's original vision depends on your perspective. But the market has clearly spoken: Bitcoin's store-of-value narrative has driven more adoption than its payment utility.

2. The 5% Problem Might Be the Point If Bitcoin succeeds as “digital gold,” it doesn't need universal adoption. Gold's monetary role historically came from scarcity, not ubiquity. The same logic could apply to Bitcoin.

3. The Speculation vs. Utility Debate Isn't Settled Bitcoin's future depends on whether it can develop genuine utility beyond speculation. The next few years will determine whether Bitcoin becomes a lasting store of value or just an expensive lesson in collective delusion.

The “5% problem” isn't actually a problem—it's a feature. Bitcoin's limited adoption might be exactly what gives it value in a world of infinite money printing.

But that doesn't mean Bitcoin is risk-free. As one commenter noted: “Its value is 95% speculation so 5% seems about right.”

For investors, the question isn't whether Bitcoin will achieve universal adoption as a currency. The question is whether 5% of the population believing in Bitcoin's scarcity narrative is enough to sustain and grow its value over time.

The Reddit debate suggests that for now, the answer is yes. Whether that remains true as central banks develop digital currencies and traditional financial systems adapt remains to be seen.

While the rest of the world rushes headlong into crypto experimentation, Hong Kong has taken a different route – less Silicon Valley, more central bank.

Its licensing regime for stablecoin issuers, which took effect in 2024, isn't designed to foster hype or speed. Instead, it's a filter: fully backed reserves, high liquidity, zero tolerance for algorithmic or partially collateralized models.

In short – no Terra, no Tether, no nonsense. This isn't reluctance. It's design. A financial ecosystem still healing from trust erosion, Hong Kong is playing the long game.

Hong Kong Monetary Authority CEO Eddie Yue made it plain: Participating in the sandbox doesn't guarantee a license. The message to global fintechs is sharp: Test freely, but you'll only graduate if you prove resilient. Stability isn't an aspiration – it's a requirement.

The framework echoes traditional banking safeguards, translated into a digital idiom. If crypto wants to grow up, it'll have to wear a suit – and in Hong Kong, the tailor is unforgiving.

While Western regulators are bogged down in fragmented crypto debates, Hong Kong is executing a calibrated pivot: integrating stablecoin infrastructure with trade platforms such as CargoX and the Commercial Data Interchange (CDI). This isn't just about currency – it's about programmable logistics.

By aligning stablecoins with trade digitization, Hong Kong is quietly writing the playbook for how digital assets can be embedded in global commerce – not as speculation, but as infrastructure.

“The global expansion of US dollar stablecoins is posing fresh challenges to yuan internationalization,” said Wang Yongli, a former Bank of China vice president who is now co-chairman of Digital China Information Service Group. “It would be a strategic risk if cross-border yuan payment is not as efficient as dollar stablecoins.”

Hong Kong's model walks a tightrope between proximity and autonomy. It does not allow stablecoins to peg to the RMB unless explicitly authorized, preserving China's monetary sovereignty while creating a sandbox-with-bounds.

This makes Hong Kong an ideal buffer zone for digital currency innovation – close enough to Beijing to remain aligned, yet distinct enough to pilot what the Mainland cannot.

The success of Hong Kong's stablecoin framework undoubtedly can serve as a practical reference and valuable experience for a future RMB stablecoin, contributing to a strategic deployment aimed at enhancing cross-border payment efficiency.

The IMF recently praised key pillars such as strong reserve management and redemption guarantees – without naming names. But the subtext is clear: Hong Kong's architecture checks the boxes. Should a Basel-like global standard emerge for stablecoins, Hong Kong might already be the reference draft.

The greatest risk? That the same walls built to guard against collapse may also keep out genuine innovators. Startups might balk at licensing thresholds, leaving the field to banks and legacy players – hardly the vanguard of Web3. Yet Hong Kong appears willing to accept this. It would rather miss the next Tether than host the next Terra.

This city is building a regulatory citadel. It isn't chasing unicorns – it's engineering longevity. In an industry plagued by whiplash regulation and overnight implosions, Hong Kong's sober, measured, almost boring approach may become its greatest competitive edge.

Because, when the music stops, the city with a seatbelt – and not just a seat – will be the one still standing.

Not sure I'm going to put too much weight in this article considering the author has a stake in what he's selling.

Br0wnn0sing is the loss of self-confidence or a trait of a wimp. Even a child knows that “money is power,” and Mr. Sze (weird name 😉 ) doesn't seem to know this, kneeling to br0wnn0s the Chinese “nomenklatura.”
In a totalitarian regime like China's, the yuan is the lifeblood of the CCP, and of course, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority must follow the CCP's instructions. Nothing to do with wisdom or prudence. Cryptocurrencies are, so to speak, a rebellion against the establishment.
Even Golem Donut Trumpet would like to become president for life in the US. The US regime isn't totalitarian, but perhaps somewhat authoritarian because of this Golem. Therefore, cryptocurrency is traded freely in the West, and the Chinese are exploiting this freedom and are at the forefront of this volatile and fraudulent market. For example, wired.com:
– “Telegram cleaned up Chinese crypto fraud markets—and then watched them rebuild.”
– “An $8.4 billion Chinese crypto crime hub is being established in Colorado.”

HK is making good progress. BRICS should focus on CBDCs, this will be the future ecosystem that neuters sanctions and weaponization schemes of the West. CBDCs will connect disparate economies and banking systems through central banks and blockchain. The West on the other hand, does not do CBDCs because they already manipulate the existing system. In fact, to the crypto community's detriment, the US under Trump will be offloading USD Treasuries to stablecoin issuers, effectively rendering them ‘bagholders' to toxic fiat products. We all know the US is heading for bankruptcy. What a great idea for Trump it must be to exploit the crypto community this way.  For the rest of BRICS, keep focusing on CBDCs – the time for moving on from America is now upon us.

Fat Kim, bosom friend of Vampir Poo-tin, needs such fraudenlent market for the sur.vival of his dynasty. According to Fintechweekly.com:  N Korea's total Bitcoin holdings to 13,562 BTC, valued at approximately $1.14 billion.

Bitcoin nowadays is one of the most popular, with the highest corporate, public, and institutional adoption, and with time, its usage and presence have gained significant traction. But after this trend in BTC buying, a new trend has been evolving in the market which further treasures companies from Bitcoin to Ethereum, Solana, BNB, and Hyperliquid.

After a injection of million of dollars to expand their invested treasury beyond Bitcoin to Ethereum, Solana, BNB, and Hyperliquid a sudden change in prices of these cryptos has been seen, with major chance and development noted in circulating supply, volume, market capitalization and others which has now a question for discussion that will these blockchain-based currencies follow the same positive that Bitcoin did.

In today's informative piece, we will dive deep to understand how these skyrocketing purchases of Ethereum, Solana, BNB, and Hyperliquid will shape their future, or will reverse the hype.Companies seeking diverse digital assets adoption 

The investment landscape for digital assets is undergoing a rapid transformation extending far beyond the initial focus on Bitcoin, dozens of publicly listed companies and institutional investors are now actively exploring a broader spectrum of cryptocurrencies commonly known as altcoins. 

Following the evolution of Bitcoin from a bogus cryptocurrency to recognized institutional assets, several factors have contributed to this image change, including regulatory clarity, broader utility and use cases, institutional product availability, market maturity and liquidity, and acceptance as a legitimate asset class.

A defining characteristic of Bitcoin institutional integration has been its adoption as a corporate treasury asset by publicly listed companies. Strategy under the chairmanship of Michael Saylor, pioneered this strategy, commencing significant acquisitions in 2020.

Regulatory clarity is paramount for attracting traditional financial institutions, serving as the foundational bedrock for confidence and participation in new asset classes. 

A pivotal moment in Bitcoin's institutional journey was the approval of the 11-spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. SEC in January 2024. This historic decision provided a regulated and accessible avenue for institutions to offer crypto products to their clients, aligning digital assets with the existing financial framework and significantly boosting investors' confidence.

Bitcoin's narrative as “ digital gold” has been a powerful driver of institutional adoption. This comparison stems from its inherent scarcity with a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, which proponents argue protects it from the inflationary pressure associated with unlimited fiat currency printing.

Its decentralized nature, operating independently of central banks and governments, further strengthens this “digital gold” appeal, positioning it as a hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainties.

Ethereum buying on the peak, know why? 

 Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, has consistently attracted significant institutional interest due to its pioneering smart contracts capabilities and vast ecosystem.

Its journey towards institutional ‘diversity' has followed a distinct path, marked by evolving regulatory clarity, robust ecosystem development, and a unique value proposition.

Publicly traded companies are increasingly integrating Ethereum into their treasury strategies, mirroring the corporate adoption seen with Bitcoin.

Sharplink Gaming has notably positioned itself as the world's largest publicly traded ETH holder, with its treasury expanding to 198,167 Ethereum as of June 2025.

Other publicly listed companies, Bit Digital, Galaxy Digital, and DeFi Development, are also active in holding and staking Ethereum. 

Finoan operates 8,500 ETH validators with strategic importance of staking yield-seeking mandates, moving Ethereum beyond pure speculative investment to yield-generating assets within a regulated framework.

Buying Solana has grown, why? 

Solana has rapidly emerged as a significant contender in the blockchain ecosystem, positioning itself as a high-performance alternative to Ethereum. Institutional interest in Solana has been steadily increasing, driven by its robust ecosystem and promises of scalability.

Publicly listed companies are beginning to incorporate Solana into their treasury strategies, signaling a broader acceptance of altcoins beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. A prominent example is DeFi Development Corp., which has adopted a treasury policy primarily focused on Solana.

Neptune Digital Assets and Sol Strategies are also actively investing in Solana-based projects and staking, further indicating a diversifying corporate treasury landscape.

The increasing institutional demand for Solana is rooted in the need for rapid and cost-effective blockchain solutions.

Solana's regulatory classification in the United States has presented a notable challenge. While it has gained significant institutional popularity, it has faced classification hurdles from past SEC language labeling it a security.

The Securities and Exchange Commission of the U.S. has formally acknowledged Grayscale's spot Solana ETF filing, with a filing decision anticipated by October this year. Odds are favoring the approval of the SOL spot ETF before the year's end.

Binance Coinbase (BNB) buying is spiking, why? 

Binance coin holds a unique position in the digital asset market, deeply intertwined with the vast Binance ecosystem, while it has achieved significant market capitalization and attracted corporate interest, its path to broader institutional diversity is notably distinct from Bitcoin and Ethereum.

BNB has gained traction from publicly listed companies seeking to diversify their digital asset holdings. Most recently, Nano Labs Ltd has embraced BNB with the announcement to acquire Binance coin worth $1 billion. 

An initial purchase of $50 million in July 2025, this strategic move aims to enhance their digital currency reserves, which also include Bitcoin, and ultimately hold between 5% to 10% of the total circulation of BNB. 

The primary utility of BNB is deeply embedded within the Binance ecosystem, which includes the Binance exchange, Binance Chain, Binance Smart Chain, Binance Academy, and Trust Wallet.

BNB serves multiple functions: it acts as a utility token for discounted trading fees on the Binance exchange, functions as gas to pay for transaction fees on the BNB Chain, and grants holders governance rights on the BNB Beacon Chain. It's integration into decentralized finance applications on the BNB Chain.

Conclusion 

The evolving crypto investment strategies of public companies reflect a significant shift from Bitcoin-only treasuries to diversified digital asset portfolios. Ethereum, Solana, BNB, and Hyperliquid are no longer seen as secondary options but as valuable assets with distinct utilities, growing ecosystems, and yield-generating potential. This diversification signals confidence in the long-term viability of the broader blockchain landscape.

While Bitcoin remains the gold standard of institutional crypto adoption, the rising inclusion of Ethereum for its staking capabilities, Solana for its scalability, BNB for its ecosystem utility, and Hyperliquid for its emerging potential points toward a maturing market. However, regulatory clarity will continue to play a critical role in defining the pace and scale of institutional adoption. © Todayq News

The debate about the longevity of Bitcoin has been ongoing for years. Most people would say that Bitcoin will end because of quantum technology, however, I believe there's another answer. 

Ever since Bitcoin debuted in 2009, people have speculated about the survival of this digital currency. Many people believed that it would go to zero, but 16 years later, governments are recognizing its potential as gold 2.0. 

Let's be real. Bitcoin has proven its reliability as an asset after reaching almost $112,000 per coin. The total market cap of cryptocurrencies hit an all-time high of $3.91 trillion, and most of this money was in Bitcoin. At the peak, BTC had a market cap of $2.227 trillion, while the remaining $1.68 trillion was in the 17,000-ish altcoins. 

Bitcoin is an asset class—other altcoins aren't included in this category. This is because BTC is among the top 10 assets ranked by market cap according to data from Infinite Market Cap.

Despite the massive success of Bitcoin, there's a technological phenomenon I believe that would kill the crypto king. 

Quantum computing is considered a major threat to Bitcoin. More specifically, quantum computers could break the complex mathematical algorithms that support modern cryptography. It could also make it possible to access dormant wallets and spend any Bitcoins from the Satoshi era. 

Quantum computing originates from two fields: quantum mechanics and computer science. 

Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics. It examines the physics of energy and matter at the atomic and subatomic levels. The behavior of atoms and subatomic particles is unique and classical physics laws like Newton's laws can't fully explain it. There are specific principles and phenomena that explain quantum mechanics such as superposition, quantization, etc.

Computer science is the study of computational systems and it includes algorithms, data structure, programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, etc. 

Quantum computing takes principles from quantum mechanics and applies them to computing for superior processing power.

But how could quantum computing crack the Bitcoin algorithm? Could it really make it possible to access dormant BTC coins?

Theoretically, if someone builds a powerful quantum computer and obtains your public key, they could derive your private key, forge a valid signature, and spend your BTC. 

This scenario depends on the type of wallet address used, whether the public key has been revealed, and the processing speed of the quantum computer.

All BTC in pay-to-public-key (p2pk) addresses and reused pay-to-public-key-hash (p2pkh) addresses are vulnerable to a quantum computer attack. In a p2pk address, the public key is exposed on the blockchain by default, even before any coins are spent. In a p2pkh address, the public key is not revealed until the coins are spent.

P2pk and p2pkh addresses were dominant in the early days of Bitcoin. The BTC mined by Satoshi Nakamoto are stored in p2pk addresses. 

In 2020, the number of Bitcoins in p2pk addresses was around 2 million coins, while p2pkh addresses had 2.5 million coins. A total of 4.5 million Bitcoins is equivalent to around $490 billion. 

In terms of processing speed, a quantum computer must derive the private key and broadcast a competing transaction before the next block is mined, typically within 10 minutes. 

So if a quantum computer takes two hours to derive a private key from a publicly available public key, it won't be able to spend the Bitcoins—because transactions are typically confirmed within 10 minutes. However, if the address is reused and receives new coins after the public key has already been revealed, those new funds become vulnerable, and the quantum computer could potentially spend them.

NEMP stands for nuclear electromagnetic pulse. It's considered both a technological phenomenon and a weapon. 

As the name indicates, an NEMP generates a pulse of electromagnetic radiation from a nuclear explosion, especially one detonated at high altitude. Instead of causing physical damage, an NEMP is intentionally detonated to generate an intense electromagnetic pulse. 

This results in an extremely high voltage and current surges into anything that conducts electricity — wires, antennas, power lines, computers, electronics etc. In other words, an NEMP will fry every electrical and electronic equipment and device. 

Because of the high altitude, an NEMP explosion can affect thousands of kilometers and impact an entire country or even continent. This means servers, data centers and Bitcoin mining farms are gone in a fraction of a second.

According to a YouGov poll, around 68 to 76% of Europeans and Americans believe that nuclear arms will be used in World War III. Analysts also point to growing tensions between major nuclear powers, including Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and the US. The recent Israel–Iran conflict, along with US-supported strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, is the closest the world has come to a nuclear war in recent years.

The debate about the longevity of Bitcoin has been ongoing for years. Most people would say that Bitcoin will end because of quantum technology, however, I believe there's another answer. 

Ever since Bitcoin debuted in 2009, people have speculated about the survival of this digital currency. Many people believed that it would go to zero, but 16 years later, governments are recognizing its potential as gold 2.0. 

Let's be real. Bitcoin has proven its reliability as an asset after reaching almost $112,000 per coin. The total market cap of cryptocurrencies hit an all-time high of $3.91 trillion, and most of this money was in Bitcoin. At the peak, BTC had a market cap of $2.227 trillion, while the remaining $1.68 trillion was in the 17,000-ish altcoins. 

Bitcoin is an asset class—other altcoins aren't included in this category. This is because BTC is among the top 10 assets ranked by market cap according to data from Infinite Market Cap.

Despite the massive success of Bitcoin, there's a technological phenomenon I believe that would kill the crypto king. 

Quantum computing is considered a major threat to Bitcoin. More specifically, quantum computers could break the complex mathematical algorithms that support modern cryptography. It could also make it possible to access dormant wallets and spend any Bitcoins from the Satoshi era. 

Quantum computing originates from two fields: quantum mechanics and computer science. 

Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics. It examines the physics of energy and matter at the atomic and subatomic levels. The behavior of atoms and subatomic particles is unique and classical physics laws like Newton's laws can't fully explain it. There are specific principles and phenomena that explain quantum mechanics such as superposition, quantization, etc.

Computer science is the study of computational systems and it includes algorithms, data structure, programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, etc. 

Quantum computing takes principles from quantum mechanics and applies them to computing for superior processing power.

But how could quantum computing crack the Bitcoin algorithm? Could it really make it possible to access dormant BTC coins?

Theoretically, if someone builds a powerful quantum computer and obtains your public key, they could derive your private key, forge a valid signature, and spend your BTC. 

This scenario depends on the type of wallet address used, whether the public key has been revealed, and the processing speed of the quantum computer.

All BTC in pay-to-public-key (p2pk) addresses and reused pay-to-public-key-hash (p2pkh) addresses are vulnerable to a quantum computer attack. In a p2pk address, the public key is exposed on the blockchain by default, even before any coins are spent. In a p2pkh address, the public key is not revealed until the coins are spent.

P2pk and p2pkh addresses were dominant in the early days of Bitcoin. The BTC mined by Satoshi Nakamoto are stored in p2pk addresses. 

In 2020, the number of Bitcoins in p2pk addresses was around 2 million coins, while p2pkh addresses had 2.5 million coins. A total of 4.5 million Bitcoins is equivalent to around $490 billion. 

In terms of processing speed, a quantum computer must derive the private key and broadcast a competing transaction before the next block is mined, typically within 10 minutes. 

So if a quantum computer takes two hours to derive a private key from a publicly available public key, it won't be able to spend the Bitcoins—because transactions are typically confirmed within 10 minutes. However, if the address is reused and receives new coins after the public key has already been revealed, those new funds become vulnerable, and the quantum computer could potentially spend them.

NEMP stands for nuclear electromagnetic pulse. It's considered both a technological phenomenon and a weapon. 

As the name indicates, an NEMP generates a pulse of electromagnetic radiation from a nuclear explosion, especially one detonated at high altitude. Instead of causing physical damage, an NEMP is intentionally detonated to generate an intense electromagnetic pulse. 

This results in an extremely high voltage and current surges into anything that conducts electricity — wires, antennas, power lines, computers, electronics etc. In other words, an NEMP will fry every electrical and electronic equipment and device. 

Because of the high altitude, an NEMP explosion can affect thousands of kilometers and impact an entire country or even continent. This means servers, data centers and Bitcoin mining farms are gone in a fraction of a second.

According to a YouGov poll, around 68 to 76% of Europeans and Americans believe that nuclear arms will be used in World War III. Analysts also point to growing tensions between major nuclear powers, including Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and the US. The recent Israel–Iran conflict, along with US-supported strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, is the closest the world has come to a nuclear war in recent years.  



If a global-scale NEMP attack happens, it could wipe out Bitcoin mining equipment, nodes, internet infrastructure and modern technology as we know it today. In 1949 Albert Einstein said “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.”

""Wall Street is coming for bitcoin.""

That phrase used to spark both hope and fear across crypto circles. Today, it's no longer a future threat or a bullish promise—it's just reality. 

The original premise of bitcoin (or crypto in general)—an asset that is censorship-resistant and doesn't answer to any traditional financial institution or government—is fading fast as Wall Street giants (as well as powerful political figures) continue to establish their strong foothold in the digital assets space. 

During the early years of the digital assets revolution, bitcoin was celebrated as uncorrelated and unapologetically anti-establishment. TradFi asset classes like S&P 500 would rise and fall—bitcoin didn't care. 

What bitcoin did care about were the flaws in the traditional financial system, which are still here to this day. 

A major example in BTC's history that's not-so-talked about anymore is the 2013 Cyprus banking crisis.

The crisis, which occurred due to overexposure of banks to overleveraged local property companies and amid Europe's debt crisis, saw deposits above 100,000 euros get a substantial haircut.

In fact, 47.5% of uninsured deposits were seized. Bitcoin's response was to move sharply upward to, for the first time in its history, cross the $1,000 threshold.

After a prolonged bear market over the collapse of Mt. Gox, the idea of mass adoption grew, with Wall Street's entry into the sector seen as a stamp of validation for bitcoin as it meant more liquidity, mass adoption and price maturity.  

That changed everything. 

The price might have matured, as evidenced by waning volatility. But let's face it—bitcoin is now just another macro-driven risk asset.

""Bitcoin, once celebrated for its low correlation to mainstream financial assets, has increasingly exhibited sensitivity to the same variables that drive equity markets over short time frames,"" said NYDIC Research in a report. 

In fact, the correlation is now hovering near the higher end of the historical range, according to NYDIG's calculations. ""Bitcoin's correlation with U.S. equities remained elevated through the end of the quarter, closing at 0.48, a level near the higher end of its historical range.""

Simply put, when there is blood on the street (Wall Street that is), bitcoin bleeds too. When Wall Street sneezes, bitcoin catches a cold.

Even bitcoin's “digital gold” moniker is under pressure. 

NYDIG notes that bitcoin's correlation to physical gold and the U.S. dollar is near zero. So much for the “hedge” argument—at least for now.

So why the shift? 

The answer is simple: to Wall Street, bitcoin is just another risk asset, not digital gold, which is synonymous with ""safe haven.""

Investors are repricing everything from central bank policy whiplash to geopolitical tension—digital assets included.

""This persistent correlation strength with U.S. equities can largely be attributed to a series of macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, the tariff turmoil and the rising number of global conflicts, which significantly influenced investor sentiment and asset repricing across markets,"" said NYDIG.

And like it or not, this is here to stay—at least for a short to medium-term. 

As long as central bank policy, macro, and war-linked red headlines hit the tape, bitcoin will likely move in tandem with equities.  

""The current correlation regime may persist as long as global risk sentiment, central bank policy, and geopolitical flashpoints remain dominant market narratives,"" NYDIG's report said. 

For the maxis and long-term holders, the original vision hasn't changed. Bitcoin's limited supply, borderless access, and decentralized nature remain untouched. Just don't expect them to impact price action just yet. 

For now, the market sees bitcoin as just another stock ticker. Just balance your trade strategies accordingly.

Major cryptocurrencies rose Sunday morning as the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at upcoming trade deals before the July 9 Liberation Day tariff deadline.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, gained over 1%, briefly topping $109,000. Payments-focused XRP and Solana's SOL token gained over 2% each, with meme token dogecoin DOGE$0.1706 rising 3%, according to data source CoinDesk. Ethereum's ether, the second-largest token, rose 1.5% to $2,550.

In an interview with CNN, Bessent stated that the U.S. is close to finalizing several trade deals ahead of the July 9 deadline, when the temporary pause in higher tariffs initially announced on April 2 is set to expire.

""President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,"" Bessent said, per Reuters.

Bessent explained that July 9 remains the deadline for negotiations, failing which higher tariffs, announced in early April, will take effect from Aug. 1.

""We are saying this is when it's happening. If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that's your choice,"" Bessent told CNN, adding that some countries were 'foot-dragging' on getting to deals.

Since taking office early this year, President Donald Trump has been focused on making the U.S. wealthy again by imposing tariffs on goods imported from other countries, a coercive tactic aimed at rebalancing trade relations and reducing the U.S. trade deficit.

Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, starting with a 10% base tax on all trading partners and additional amounts on many countries, with some ranging as high as 50%. The so-called Liberation Day announcement triggered a sell-off in financial markets, with U.S. stocks taking a significant hit alongside a sharp decline in bitcoin, which fell to $75,000.

The panic likely prompted the Trump administration to announce a 90-day pause a week later.

Since then, the so-called U.S. exceptionalism has resurfaced in financial markets, lifting major U.S. equity indices to record highs. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have outperformed their global peers, with BTC rallying to trade above $100,000.

The Bitcoin blockchain lacks meaningful on-chain activity, even as its native token, bitcoin BTC$108,883.22, trades near a record per-unit price. That's according to mempool – a holding area for unconfirmed blockchain transactions waiting to be included in a block by miners.

On Satuday, the mempool had just 5,000 odd transactions awaiting inclusion, with the tally rising to 15,000 at press time, still a far cry from 150,000 when BTC's price first rose above $100,000 in late 2024, according to data source Blockchain.com.

Since March this year, the tally has oscillated between $3,000 and $30,000, indicating anaemic demand for the network despite BTC establishing a foothold above $100,000.

""Bitcoin's mempool (queue of transactions waiting to be processed) is almost completely empty. The percentage of miner revenue coming from fees (instead of inflation) is down to a fraction of a percent,"" Joël Valenzuela, director of marketing and business development, said on X.

""Simply put, almost all of Bitcoin's actual users have gone away. At all-time price highs, too!"" Valenzuela added, calling the situation a major crisis where the network goes bankrupt or becomes ""completely custodial asset run by governments and institutions.""

According to Joao Wedson, CEO and founder of crypto data analysis platform Alphractal, the idle mempool is a sign of missing retail participation in the market.

""When Mempool transactions begin to rise again, it's a clear sign that retail is back — because the growing backlog reflects increased demand for using the network,"" Wedson said.

 Secret Service quietly amasses one of the world's largest crypto cold wallets with $400 million seized, exposing scams through blockchain sleuthing and VPN missteps. 

The US Secret Service has quietly seized nearly $400 million in digital assets over the past decade, amassing one of the world's largest crypto cold wallets, Bloomberg reported Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The agency's Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) has tracked funds through open-source tools, blockchain analysis, and patience, Jamie Lam, an investigative analyst with the US Secret Service, reportedly told law enforcement officials in Bermuda last month.

The agency's crypto trove, much of which sits in a single cold-storage wallet, results from a string of investigations into scams. Scammers lure targets into seemingly legitimate crypto investment platforms in one typical scheme. Victims often see initial profits before the sites vanish with their deposits.

“That's how they do it,” Lam said. “They'll send you a photo of a really good-looking guy or girl. But it's probably some old guy in Russia.”

Lam's team uses domain records, blockchain transactions, and VPN slip-ups to identify fraudsters. In one case, a cryptocurrency payment led investigators to another wallet. In another one, a brief VPN failure exposed an IP address, helping agents piece together the scam's digital trail.

At the helm of the Secret Service's crypto strategy is Kali Smith, who directs a team that has trained officials in over 60 countries to unmask online financial crimes.

The agency has focused on jurisdictions with weak oversight or programs selling residency to foreign nationals. “Sometimes after just a week-long training, they can be like, ‘Wow, we didn't even realize that this is occurring in our country,'” Smith said.

The Secret Service's work has uncovered scams ranging from romance-investment schemes to sextortion cases. One investigation involved an Idaho teenager who sent a nude photo to an online stranger. The scammer extorted $300 twice before the teen went to the police.

Analysts traced the payments through another coerced teenager acting as a money mule, leading to an account tied to nearly $4.1 million in transactions under a Nigerian passport. British police arrested the suspected extortionist when he arrived in Guildford, England, where he remains in custody pending extradition.

Crypto-related scams have become the top driver of US internet crime losses. Americans reported $9.3 billion stolen in crypto fraud in 2024, more than half of the $16.6 billion in total internet crime losses that year, FBI data show.

Meanwhile, the first half of 2025 has seen more than $2.47 billion in losses due to hacks, scams and exploits, representing a nearly 3% increase compared to the $2.4 billion stolen in 2024.

Recovering stolen crypto often depends on cooperation from industry players. Coinbase and Tether have acknowledged assisting in high-profile cases by analyzing transactions and freezing wallets. One of the largest single recoveries involved $225 million in USDt (USDT) linked to romance scams.

 Arkham says the massive Bitcoin whale transfer might be due to a wallet upgrade, but others in the industry have their own theories. 

Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham says the recent $8.6 billion in Bitcoin that was moved on Thursday for the first time in over 14 years doesn't appear to be heading for a sell-off.

“There are no indications that this whale is selling Bitcoin,” Arkham said in an X post on Friday. Arkham added that the eight transfers — which moved 10,000 Bitcoin (BTC) at a time from eight wallets that were untouched for over 14 years — may be possibly due to the owner upgrading from the original legacy wallet to a Native SegWit address, which is said to have improved security and lower fees.

“Yesterday's $8 billion transfers were possibly related to address upgrades, moving from 1-addresses to bc1q-addresses,” Arkham said.

Arkham said earlier on Friday that all the Bitcoin was originally deposited into the wallets on April 2 or May 4, 2011, and remained untouched for more than 14 years. The firm added that the Bitcoin is now stored in eight new wallets and hasn't been moved since.

In a post on the same day, blockchain research firm 10x Research said that while there's no clear evidence a large amount of Bitcoin is being prepared for sale, its analysis has “long suggested that early holders are gradually offloading into ETF and corporate treasury demand.” 

Only in February, prominent Bitcoiner PlanB revealed that he converted all of his Bitcoin holdings to spot Bitcoin ETFs. “Not having to hassle with keys gives me peace of mind. I guess I am not a maxi anymore,” PlanB said in a Feb. 15 X post.

Meanwhile, Coinbase's head of product, Conor Grogan, raised a more alarming possibility.

Grogan said there's a slight chance a hack caused the $8.6 billion Bitcoin transfer, and if so, it could be the largest robbery ever.

Related:  Bitcoin miners gambled on AI last year, and it paid off

“If true (again, I'm speculating on straws here), this would be by far the largest heist in human history,” Grogan said in an X post on Friday,

The transfers caught the attention of the broader crypto industry, with some taking a light-hearted approach. Binance former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said, “I got into crypto too late.”

“After seeing the 2011 whales casually moving crypto they got for $0.1,” Zhao added.

 Fund manager Bill Miller IV says the government shouldn't be able to tax Bitcoin because it requires no work on their end. 

Governments have no right to tax Bitcoin because managing ownership rights requires no administrative efforts, says Miller Value Partners chief investment officer Bill Miller IV.

“For them to reach their hand in there doesn't make a ton of sense,” Miller told Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast on Wednesday.

Miller, known for his early Bitcoin (BTC) advocacy, said Bitcoin doesn't rely on government infrastructure to verify or enforce property rights, unlike traditional assets such as real estate.

“When you buy or sell a house, all that recordation tax, all those taxes go toward keeping track of who owns what,” Miller said.

“The reality is if you think about why you pay taxes in society, it is to enforce property rights,” he added.

Miller said this is not necessary with Bitcoin. “The government didn't create Bitcoin, so that is an important point to keep in mind,” he said, adding:

Earlier this year, rumors circulated that US President Donald Trump's son, Eric Trump, proposed eliminating capital gains taxes on certain US-based cryptocurrencies. Regarding the possibility of Bitcoin being exempt from capital gains tax, Miller said, “Whether that ultimately happens or not, who knows but it is very cool that there is no wash sale rule on Bitcoin.”

When asked if he sees Bitcoin ever having a property tax, similar to how properties are taxed in the US annually based on the market value, he says he isn't sure, but “there is a good argument for it not to.”

Meanwhile, Miller said traditional asset managers still face hurdles when buying Bitcoin, primarily because of uncertainty around taxation.

“Even as fund managers, we still have huge impediments to actually buying it because taxation rules around bad income if we buy ETFs and sell them at the wrong time, so that all needs to be worked out,” he said.

“That's why I continue to say it is still early because the taxation rules around it are really interesting,” he added.

Bill Miller IV is the son of legendary investor Bill Miller III, a fund manager known for beating the S&P 500 for 15 consecutive years at investment giant Legg Mason.

In a January 2022 interview, Miller III said he holds 50% of his net worth in Bitcoin and related investments in major industry firms like Michael Saylor's Strategy and BTC mining firm Stronghold Digital Mining.

This Block-Stacking Math Problem Has a Preposterous Solution You Need to See to Believe

In principle, this impossible math allows for a glue-free bridge of stacked blocks that can stretch across the Grand Canyon—and into infinity

By Jack Murtagh edited by Jeanna Bryner

Amanda Montañez

Here's a mind-blowing experiment that you can try at home: Gather some children's blocks and place them on a table. Take one block and slowly push it over the table's edge, inch by inch, until it's on the brink of falling. If you possess patience and a steady hand, you should be able to balance it so that exactly half of it hangs off the edge. Nudge it any farther, and gravity wins. Now take two blocks and start over. Stacking one on top of the other, how far can you get the end of the top block to poke over the table's edge?

Amanda Montañez

Keep going. Stacking as many blocks as you can, what is the farthest overhang you can achieve before the whole structure topples? Is it possible for the tower to extend a full block length beyond the lip of the table? Does physics permit two block lengths? The stunning answer is that the stacked bridge can stretch forever. In principle, a freestanding stack of blocks can span the Grand Canyon, no glue required.

Don't click “checkout” on an infinite pack of Jenga blocks just yet. Real-world practicalities such as irregular block shapes, air currents and the crushing weight of an endless edifice may hamper your engineering aspirations. Still, understanding why the overhang has no limit in an ideal mathematical world is enlightening. The explanation hinges on math's harmonic series and the physics concept of center of mass, two seemingly simple ideas with outsize power. [For more fun, check out: How Tall Can You Build a Tower without It Toppling?]

Your intuition might tell you that a single block can hang half of its mass beyond the table's edge before tipping. But why is that so? Every object has a center of mass—a single point at which we can imagine the entire object's weight to be concentrated when we're thinking about balance. As long as the center of mass sits above the table, the object stays put. The moment that center of mass passes over an edge, however, gravity will pull the whole thing over. In the case of a spoon, an item with irregular weight distribution, we can hang more than half of the utensil's handle over an edge before it tips because the center of mass lies closer to its head, where more of the weight resides. For our stacked bridge, we assume that our blocks are all identical, with a uniform density (that is, they're not denser in some parts than others), so each one's center of mass sits at the middle point.

When we add more blocks, we must account for the center of mass of the entire tower. Consider the case of two blocks. We know the top block can extend half of its mass beyond the one below it. But after doing that, how far can we push out the bottom block?

Amanda Montañez

For simplicity, let's say each block has a length of 1 and a mass of 1. You'll find the bottom block can poke out only a quarter of the way (compared with having half its length over the edge when it was alone). At that point, the center of mass of the top block and the center of mass of the bottom block are equidistant from the edge of the table (the top block's center of mass sits one quarter to the right of the edge, and the bottom block's center of mass sits one quarter to the left of the edge). So the combined center of mass of the two-block system rests perfectly balanced above the edge of the table.

A pattern emerges as we continue to add blocks to the structure. The top block extends 1⁄2 beyond the one below it, the second block extends 1⁄4 beyond the block below it, the third extends 1⁄6, the fourth extends 1⁄8, then subsequent blocks extend 1⁄10, 1⁄12, and so on. To see why, let's look at another example. Suppose we have a stable tower that contains five blocks, and we want to add a sixth block below it and then slide the whole structure out as far as we can. It's helpful to conceptualize this picture as only two blocks: one with a mass of 5 atop a single block with a mass of 1. We'll first scoot the heavy block as far as it will go so that its center of mass sits right above the bottom block's edge. We can then push the bottom block exactly 1⁄12 of a unit beyond the table's edge. How do we know that?

Amanda Montañez

Again, the answer comes down to balancing out the centers of mass of the two blocks, only this time, because the bottom block is five times lighter, its center of mass must end up five times farther on the tabletop to counteract the weight of the heavier block. This is known as the law of the lever—think about how a book feels heavier in your palm the farther you move it away from your body, so a paperback in a fully extended arm might feel equivalent to a textbook held close to your torso. The distance between the center of mass of the top block and the table's edge is 1⁄12, and the distance for the bottom block is 1⁄2 – 1⁄12 = 5⁄12, or five times more. A similar calculation reveals the correct overhang at every level of the tower.

Amanda Montañez

Answering our opening question (how far out can the tower extend?) amounts to adding up all of these successive overhangs. If you have 10 blocks, they can extend to 1⁄2 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄6 + 1⁄8 + 1⁄10 + 1⁄12 + 1⁄14 + 1⁄16 + 1⁄18 + 1⁄20, which adds up to about 1.464 block lengths beyond the edge. But what is the limit to how far we can stack blocks? For that, we must add infinitely many of these shrinking terms. The resulting pattern bears a striking resemblance to one of the most famous infinite sums in math, the harmonic series, which takes the reciprocal of every counting number (that is, 1 divided by every positive integer) and sums them all:

1 + 1⁄2 + 1⁄3 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄5 + ..., and so on forever.

If you look closely, you might notice that the overhangs from the block-stacking problem are exactly half of each of these terms: 1⁄2 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄6 + 1⁄8 + 1⁄10 + ...

Calculus, the branch of math that digs into how things change, teaches us that even when adding up infinitely many shrinking terms, sometimes the sum converges on a finite value and sometimes it diverges to infinity. The total of the harmonic series grows incredibly slowly. The first 100,000 terms add up to about 12.1 while the first million terms only equal around 14.4. Still, at a relentless snail's pace, the harmonic series grows forever.

Each individual overhang in the block-stacking problem equals half of a term in the harmonic series. Because half of infinity is still infinity, the tower's potential overhang also has no bound.

Of course, translating pure math into practice always comes with hurdles, but the block-stacking problem offers an amusing dexterity challenge. With only four blocks, you should be able to extend the top one a full block length past the edge (1⁄2 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄6 + 1⁄8 = ~1.042). To fulfill my journalistic due diligence, I tried this at home with playing cards on my coffee table. After a few minutes of patient tinkering, I managed to balance the top card just beyond the edge, with it hanging entirely off the table, and I felt like a magician.

Two full block lengths beyond any surface would require 31 pieces. Meanwhile100 million pieces wouldn't even get you a full 10 block lengths of overhang because the sum of the first 100 million terms in the harmonic series all divided by 2 equals about 9.5. So it will take some grit to span the Grand Canyon. At huge scales, physics kicks in to topple mathematicians' fun. But in idealized conditions where center of mass and the harmonic series alone rule the roost, the possibilities are literally endless.

Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), are essential for regulating movement, emotion, and reward processing. Dysfunction of DA neurons in the SNc has been linked to the Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous research mostly focuses on the functions of DA neurons in mood regulation and reward mechanisms. Their role in more subtle and spontaneous behaviors remains poorly understood.

In a study published in Translational Psychiatry, a team led by Prof. Xuemei Liu and Prof. Pengfei Wei from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered that behaviors such as rearing, walking, and hunching are associated with the loss of SNc DA neurons, but not VTA DA neurons. These subtle features serve as key behavioral biomarkers of SNc DA neuron loss, enhancing the translational value of PD models.

Using a machine learning-enhanced three-dimensional spontaneous behavior analysis system, researchers examined the detailed motor behaviors in two mouse models of dopamine neuron depletion: a subacute MPTP-induced PD model and an AAV-mediated DA neuron loss model. This approach enabled the capture of detailed and nuanced behavioral features that traditional two-dimensional methods may overlook.

Researchers observed reductions in rearing and hunching behavior in the PD model, which correlates directly with the loss of DA neurons in the SNc but not the VTA. Although overall motor deficits were not significant, notable behavioral lateralization was revealed in the PD mice.

Moreover, using the AAV-induced ablation model, researchers confirmed that climbing, a behavior similar to rearing, was also strongly correlated with the loss of DA neurons in the SNc, and the damage to SNc neurons significantly reduced motor function and influenced the lateralization of movement.

These findings highlight the significance of rearing behavior and behavioral lateralization as potential behavioral markers for tracking the progression of PD. ""Connecting behavioral changes with targeted neural damage advances the understanding of PD progression and offers valuable insights into improving treatment strategies,"" said Prof. Liu.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New tech tracks blood sodium without a single needle","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250705084253.htm","Sun, 06 Jul 2025 08:41:04 GMT","

In a new study, researchers demonstrated long-term, non-invasive monitoring of blood sodium levels using a system that combines optoacoustic detection with terahertz spectroscopy. Accurate measurement of blood sodium is essential for diagnosing and managing conditions such as dehydration, kidney disease and certain neurological and endocrine disorders.

Terahertz radiation, which falls between microwaves and the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, is ideal for biological applications because it is low-energy and non-harmful to tissues, scatters less than near-infrared and visible light and is sensitive to structural and functional biological changes.

""For biomedical applications, terahertz spectroscopy still faces two key challenges: detecting molecules other than water in complex biological samples and penetrating thick tissue layers to enable detection inside the body,"" said research team leader Zhen Tian from Tianjin University in China. ""By adding optoacoustic detection, we were able to overcome these challenges and demonstrate the first in vivo detection of ions using terahertz waves. This is an important step toward making terahertz-based techniques practical for clinical use.""

In Optica, Optica Publishing Group's flagship journal for high-impact research, the researchers describe their new multispectral terahertz optoacoustic system and show that it can be used for noninvasive, long-term monitoring of sodium concentration in live mice without the need for any labels. Preliminary tests performed with human volunteers were also promising.

""With further development, this technology could be used to monitor sodium levels in patients without the need for blood draws,"" said Tian. ""The real-time sodium measurements could be used to safely correct imbalances in critical patients while avoiding dangerous neurological complications that can occur when sodium levels rapidly change.""

Using sound to cut the noise

The new work is part of a larger project aimed at advancing and implementing terahertz technology in the biomedical field using terahertz optoacoustic techniques. One key aim of the project is to reduce signal interference caused by water, which strongly absorbs terahertz radiation.

To overcome this interference, the researchers developed a modular system that irradiates the sample with terahertz waves. As the sample absorbs these waves, it vibrates the sodium ions connected to water molecules in the blood, creating ultrasound waves that are detected with an ultrasonic transducer. This technique, known as optoacoustic detection, converts the absorbed terahertz energy into sound waves for measurement.

""Terahertz optoacoustic technology represents a groundbreaking advancement for biomedical applications by effectively overcoming the water absorption barrier that has historically limited these applications,"" said Tian. ""The broader significance of this work extends far beyond blood sodium detection. This technology has the capability to identify various biomolecules -- including sugars, proteins, and enzymes -- by recognizing their unique terahertz absorption signatures.""

Tracking sodium without needles

To test their new system, the researchers showed that it could measure increases in blood sodium levels in blood vessels under the skin of living mice on the millisecond timescale for over 30 minutes. These measurements were taken from the ear, with the skin surface cooled to 8 °C to dampen the background optoacoustic signal from water.

The researchers also demonstrated that the terahertz optoacoustic system could quickly distinguish between high and low sodium levels in human blood samples. Finally, they noninvasively measured sodium ion levels in the blood vessels of the hands of healthy volunteers. They found that the detected optoacoustic signal from sodium was proportional to the amount of blood flow under the skin surface, even though measurements were collected without any skin cooling. While more work is needed, these results suggest that the system could be useful for non-invasive real-time monitoring.

The researchers say that adapting the system for human use will require identifying suitable detection sites on the human body -- such as inside of the mouth -- that can tolerate rapid cooling and allow strong signal detection with minimal water background noise. They are also exploring alternative signal processing methods that might make it possible to suppress water interference without the need for cooling, making the approach more practical for clinical diagnostics.

The Mamyshev oscillator (MO) is a type of fiber laser capable of producing high-energy laser pulses at a tunable repetition rate. It is a mode-locked laser which uses light travelling within a closed-loop cavity to produce laser emission. Harmonic mode-locking (HML) is an advanced form of mode-locking process where multiple laser pulses are produced within one round trip of light. MOs employing HML are used for several advanced applications such as optical communication, frequency metrology, and micromachining.

Despite increasing applications of HML MOs, understanding the light buildup dynamics of HML within these lasers is experimentally challenging. In a recent study published in Journal of Lightwave Technology, researchers from Hunan University, China have uncovered the buildup dynamics of HML in an all-fiberized erbium-doped MO. They successfully obtained HML pulse outputs of different orders. In these results, the signal-to-noise ratio of all harmonic pulse trains from the all-fiber MO exceeded 80 dB, demonstrating the high stability of the output. Moreover, they investigated the transient dynamics during the startup process of HML in the MO.

""The starting dynamics of HML in the MO, characterized by the time-stretch dispersive Fourier transform technique (TS-DFT) revealed that the generation of HML is not dominated by the splitting effect of the single pulse but the amplification of the multiple seeding pulses in the oscillator,"" explains author Dr. Ning Li.

Using carefully designed experiments, the researchers identified five distinct ultrafast phases that occur between the injection of seed pulses into the laser cavity and the stable emission of HML pulses from the MO. These phases include relaxation oscillation, multi-pulses operation, pulse collapse reconstruction, unstable HML, and a stable HML state. Notably, the identified process of stable HML generation was different from the conventional pulse splitting effect thought to result in laser emission dynamics in MOs. The experimental findings were further supported using numerical simulations.

Using the TS-DFT technique, they monitored the spectra evolution within the MO cavity in real-time and performed a detailed analysis of the dynamic process during HML initiation. Observations revealed that the generation of HML in the MO was not dominated by the conventional single pulse splitting effect but rather by the amplification of multiple seeding pulses within the oscillator.

""Our experimental and simulation results showed that under these conditions, the initial seed pulses within the cavity evolve into stable independent pulses through processes such as gain amplification and energy redistribution, eventually leading to a stable HML state within the resonator,"" observes Dr. Li. ""Results from our study can deepen the understanding of HML operation in MOs, and may provide an active way to control the transient pulse dynamics in the high-performance ultrafast laser systems,"" he adds.

Overall, this study has extended our understanding of light buildup dynamics in MOs, specifically for advanced lasers using HML. Furthermore, the study challenges the conventional understanding of the light buildup and emission process in MOs.

Besides clarifying the underlying physics, the insights offered by the study may lead to improved designs of MOs - advancing their use across several fields.

Natural crystals fascinate with their vibrant colors, their nearly flawless appearance and their manifold symmetrical forms. But researchers are interested in them for quite different reasons: among the countless minerals already known, they always discover some materials with unusual magnetic properties. One of these is atacamite, which exhibits magnetocaloric behavior at low temperatures - that is, the material's temperature changes significantly when it is subjected to a magnetic field. A team headed by TU Braunschweig and the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) has now investigated this rare property (DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.216701). In the long term, the results could help to develop new materials for energy-efficient magnetic cooling.

The emerald-green mineral atacamite, named for the place it was first found, the Atacama Desert in Chile, gets its characteristic coloring from the copper ions it contains. These ions also determine the material's magnetic properties: they each have an unpaired electron whose spin gives the ion a magnetic moment - comparable to a tiny needle on a compass. ""The distinct feature of atacamite is the arrangement of the copper ions,"" explains Dr. Leonie Heinze of Jülich Centre for Neutron Science (JCNS). ""They form long chains of small, linked triangles known as sawtooth chains."" This geometric structure has consequences: although the copper ions' spins always want to align themselves antiparallel to one another, the triangular arrangement makes this geometrically impossible to achieve completely. ""We refer to this as magnetic frustration,"" continues Heinze. As result of this frustration, the spins in atacamite only arrange themselves at very low temperatures - under 9 Kelvin (−264°C) - in a static alternating structure.

When the researchers examined atacamite under the extremely high magnetic fields at HZDR's High Magnetic Field Laboratory (HLD), something surprising emerged: the material exhibited a noticeable cooling in the pulsed magnetic fields - and not just a slight one, but a drop to almost half of the original temperature. This unusually strong cooling effect particularly fascinated the researchers, as the behavior of magnetically frustrated materials in this context has scarcely been studied. However, magnetocaloric materials are considered a promising alternative to conventional cooling technologies, for example for energy-efficient cooling or the liquefaction of gases. This is because, instead of compressing and expanding a coolant - a process that takes place in every refrigerator - they can be used to change the temperature by applying a magnetic field in an environmentally friendly and potentially low-loss approach.

What is the origin of this strong magnetocaloric effect?

Additional studies at various labs of the European Magnetic Field Laboratory (EMFL) provided more in-depth insights. ""By using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we were clearly able to demonstrate that the magnetic order of atacamite is destroyed when a magnetic field is applied,"" explains Dr. Tommy Kotte, a scientist at HLD. ""This is unusual as the magnetic fields in many magnetically frustrated materials usually counteract the frustration and even encourage ordered magnetic states.""

The team found the explanation for the mineral's unexpected behavior in complex numerical simulations of its magnetic structure: while the magnetic field aligns the copper ions' magnetic moments on the tips of the sawtooth chains along the field and thus reduces the frustration as expected, it is precisely these magnetic moments that mediate a weak coupling to neighboring chains. When this is removed, a long-range magnetic order can no longer exist. This also provided the team with an explanation for the particularly strong magnetocaloric effect: it always occurs when a magnetic field influences the disorder - or more precisely, the magnetic entropy - of a system. In order to compensate for this rapid change in entropy, the material has to adjust its temperature accordingly. This is the very mechanism the researchers have now managed to demonstrate in atacamite.

""Of course, we do not expect atacamite to be extensively mined in the future for use in new cooling systems,"" says Dr. Tommy Kotte, ""but the physical mechanism we have investigated is fundamentally new and the magnetocaloric effect we observed is surprisingly strong."" The team hopes their work will inspire further research, especially a targeted search for innovative magnetocaloric materials within the extensive class of magnetically frustrated systems.

Dementia poses a major health challenge with no safe, affordable treatments to slow its progression.

Researchers at Lawson Research Institute (Lawson), the research arm of St. Joseph's Health Care London, are investigating whether Ambroxol -- a cough medicine used safely for decades in Europe -- can slow dementia in people with Parkinson's disease.

Published on June 30 in the prestigious JAMA Neurology, this 12-month clinical trial involving 55 participants with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) monitored memory, psychiatric symptoms and GFAP, a blood marker linked to brain damage. Parkinson's disease dementia causes memory loss, confusion, hallucinations and mood changes. About half of those diagnosed with Parkinson's develop dementia within 10 years, profoundly affecting patients, families and the health care system.

Led by Cognitive Neurologist Dr. Stephen Pasternak, the study gave one group daily Ambroxol while the other group received a placebo. ""Our goal was to change the course of Parkinson's dementia,"" says Pasternak. ""This early trial offers hope and provides a strong foundation for larger studies.""

Key findings from the clinical trial include:

Although Ambroxol is approved in Europe for treating respiratory conditions and has a long-standing safety record -- including use at high doses and during pregnancy -- it is not approved for any use in Canada or the U.S.

""Current therapies for Parkinson's disease and dementia address symptoms but do not stop the underlying disease,"" explains Pasternak. ""These findings suggest Ambroxol may protect brain function, especially in those genetically at risk. It offers a promising new treatment avenue where few currently exist.""

Ambroxol supports a key enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which is produced by the GBA1 gene. In people with Parkinson's disease, GCase levels are often low. When this enzyme doesn't work properly, waste builds up in brain cells, leading to damage. Pasternak learned about Ambroxol during a fellowship at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto, where it was identified as a treatment for Gaucher disease -- a rare genetic disorder in children caused by a deficiency of GCase.

He is now applying that research to explore whether boosting GCase with Ambroxol could help protect the brain in Parkinson's-related diseases. ""This research is vital because Parkinson's dementia profoundly affects patients and families,"" says Pasternak. ""If a drug like Ambroxol can help, it could offer real hope and improve lives.""

Funded by the Weston Foundation, this study is an important step toward developing new treatments for Parkinson's disease and other cognitive disorders, including dementia with Lewy bodies. Pasternak and his team plan to start a follow-up clinical trial focused specifically on cognition later this year.

In Japan, Shinrin Yoku or forest bathing has already been used for therapeutic applications, for instance, to lower blood pressure and stress levels. For their study, the researchers wanted to find out whether forest bathing - consciously immersing oneself in nature - can also be effective when done virtually, and focused on whether the positive effect is stronger when several senses are addressed simultaneously.

For the project, a high-quality 360° VR video was produced in Europe's largest Douglas fir forest, the Sonnenberg nature reserve near Parchim - complete with original sounds and the scent of essential oils from the Douglas fir. The participants experienced the virtual forest scenery either as a full sensory experience (with images, sound and scent) or in a reduced form whereby forest stimuli appealing to just a single sense - visual, auditory or olfactory - were used. In variants where only hearing or scent was activated, participants were placed in a neutral virtual environment to minimize visual stimuli and the influence of VR technology.

Significantly better effect with sensory combination 

More than 130 participants were first put into an acute stress situation using stress-inducing images. Then, equipped with VR glasses, they experienced one of the four forest stimulation/ bathing variants. The results show that the combination of all three sensory stimuli led to a significantly greater improvement in mood and a stronger feeling of connection with nature compared to when individual sensory stimuli were presented. In addition to positive effects on mood, there were also limited improvements in working memory - the cognitive function that enables us to store, process and retrieve information in the short term.

However, the researchers point out that the effects are area-specific and cannot yet be considered universally valid. Further studies with larger samples are needed to confirm the results and provide a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the restorative effects of virtual nature experiences.

""We can already say that digital nature experiences can absolutely produce an emotional effect - even if they don't replace actual nature,"" reports Leonie Ascone, lead author of the study and researcher in the Neuronal Plasticity working group at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).

Potential for clinics, waiting rooms and urban spaces 

Simone Kühn, head of the study and Director of the Center for Environmental Neuroscience at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, adds: ""Especially in places with limited access to nature - such as clinics, waiting areas or urban interiors - multisensory VR applications or targeted nature staging could support mental well-being. The images, sounds and scents of nature offer previously underestimated potential for improving mood and mental performance in everyday situations."" Kühn conducts intensive research into the effects of the environment on the human brain and, together with colleagues from universities in Vienna, Exeter and Birmingham, was recently able to prove that just from watching nature videos, patients perceive physical pain as less intense (Steininger et al., 2025).

Groundbreaking research by the University of Sydney has identified a new brain protein involved in the development of Parkinson's disease and a way to modify it, paving the way for future treatments for the disease.

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurological condition after dementia, with over 150,000 people in Australia living with the condition.

The research team, led by Professor Kay Double from the Brain and Mind Centre, has spent more than a decade studying the biological mechanisms underpinning the condition, with the aim of finding new treatments to slow or stop its progression.

In 2017, the team published a paper in Acta Neuropathologica, identifying for the first time the presence of an abnormal form of a protein - called SOD1 - in the brains of patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

Normally, the SOD1 protein provides protective benefits to the brain but, in Parkinson's patients, it becomes faulty, causing the protein to clump and damage brain cells.

The newest study by the same University of Sydney team, published in Acta Neuropathologica Communications,builds on this research. It found that targeting the faulty SOD1 protein with a drug treatment improved the motor function in mice bred to have Parkinson-like symptoms.

Professor Double said: ""All the mice we treated saw a dramatic improvement in their motor skills which is a really promising sign it could be effective in treating people who have Parkinson disease too.

""We hoped that by treating this malfunctioning protein, we might be able to improve the Parkinson-like symptoms in the mice we were treating - but even we were astonished by the success of the intervention.""

Methodology 

The study involved two groups of mice bred to have Parkinson-like symptoms. One group of mice was treated with a special copper supplement for three months, while the other received a placebo.

Throughout the study, the mice receiving the placebo saw a decline in their motor symptoms. The mice receiving the special copper supplement, however, did not develop movement problems.

Professor Double said: ""The results were beyond our expectations and suggest, once further studies are carried out, this treatment approach could slow the progression of Parkinson's disease in humans.""

What is Parkinson's disease?

Parkinson's disease is a degenerative neurological disorder in which dopamine-producing cells in the brain die, leading to a range of symptoms including tremors, muscle stiffness, slow movement and impaired balance.

At present there is no known cure and only limited treatments, although researchers hope understanding the causes of the disease will lead to improved treatments.

Professor Double said: ""As our understanding of Parkinson's disease grows, we are finding that there are many factors contributing to its development and progression in humans - and faulty forms of the SOD1 protein is likely one of them.

""Just as researchers found with HIV, Parkinson's disease is a complex condition that likely requires multiple interventions. A single treatment may have a small effect when used alone but, when combined with other interventions, contributes to a significant overall improvement in health.""

The researchers' next step is to identify the best approach to targeting the faulty SOD1 protein in a clinical trial, which could be the start of a new therapy to slow the development of Parkinson's disease.

With the rise of AI assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Gemini, we're all now well used to talking to our gadgets. But what you might not realize is that you can actually talk to type anywhere that a text-input box pops up.

This can come in handy in a variety of situations—perhaps you've got your hands full of groceries, or you're holding onto a subway rail. Maybe your phone is out of reach, or the screen's cracked and keyboard doesn't work as well as it should. Or maybe being hunched over a tiny screen to compose a message is just not your idea of fun. That is where voice typing can help.

It's not an either-or situation either: you can switch between typing and talking as you need. Here's how to do it on Android and iOS, any time the keyboard pops up—whether it's your email app or a web form.

On Pixel phones and many other Android handsets, the default keyboard is Gboard. When it pops up on screen, tap the mic icon (far right) to enable voice typing, and you can start talking. For more screen real estate, tap the downward arrow to the left of the mic icon.

What you say next is going to depend on which app you're in and what you're doing. You can use “delete” to erase the last word and “clear all” to wipe the input box fully. The “next” and “previous” commands will move you between text fields, while emojis can be spoken out as well (like “thumbs up emoji”).

When your text looks good, you'll be prompted what to say next: Keep an eye on the suggestions under the input box. If you're in a messaging app then you'll typically be prompted to say “send,” whereas if you're looking through a batch of photos for something you might have to say “search.”

Voice typing in action on Android.

Tap the small “i” icon on the left of the toolbar if you need more prompts about the voice commands you can use. If you want to keep on using voice typing in other input boxes and across other apps until you turn it off, double-tap the mic icon.

If voice typing doesn't work, check that it's enabled (it should be, by default): From Settings on Android, pick System > Keyboard > On-screen keyboard > Gboard > Voice typing. The same screen lets you enable offline access for the feature, and enable or disable automatic punctuation breaks as you talk.

The voice typing process is similar on other types of Android handset, though it might not be identical. On Galaxy phones, the Samsung Keyboard is the default, and with this keyboard the mic icon you need to tap is down in the lower left corner. To make sure voice typing is an option, from Settings choose General management > Samsung keyboard > Voice input.

Over on the iPhone, you've also got access to voice typing wherever you need it. The default keyboard is the one supplied by Apple, though you can also use alternatives such as Gboard if you wish. The keyboard shows up whenever text needs to be entered, and you can tap the mic button (bottom right) to start talking instead of typing.

You can use a variety of commands while you're talking. Just name an emoji (like “heart emoji”) or say the name of a punctuation symbol (such as “exclamation mark”) to insert the character at the current cursor position.

It's possible to split text into blocks using the “new line” and “new paragraph” commands, which is handy if you're composing a long message. You can also say “undo” or “redo” to go backwards or forwards in terms of the words you've dictated.

The cursor shows a blue mic on iOS when you're dictating.

Your iPhone also lets you use commands like “select sentence” and “delete paragraph” to give you more control over the blocks of text you're working with. Sometimes the precision isn't as good as it could be, but you should be able to compose a large part of most of your messages through this method.

However, the iPhone doesn't give you an easy way to submit the text you've entered, like Android does with the “send” or “search” commands—though in some cases searches will be automatically triggered once you stop talking. Generally, you need to stop voice dictation (by tapping the mic button or saying “stop dictation”), and then tap on the button for sending or submitting your text.

This should be set up by default with iOS, but if it's not working, open up General > Keyboard from iOS Settings, and make sure the Enable Dictation toggle switch is turned on. The other options here, such as automatic punctuation, are applied whether you're speaking out or typing your text.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

When Todd Sacktor was about to turn 3, his 4-year-old sister died of leukemia. “An empty bedroom next to mine. A swing set with two seats instead of one,” he said, recalling the lingering traces of her presence in the house. “There was this missing person—never spoken of—for which I had only one memory.” That memory, faint but enduring, was set in the downstairs den of their home. A young Sacktor asked his sister to read him a book, and she brushed him off: “Go ask your mother.” Sacktor glumly trudged up the stairs to the kitchen.

It's remarkable that, more than 60 years later, Sacktor remembers this fleeting childhood moment at all. The astonishing nature of memory is that every recollection is a physical trace, imprinted into brain tissue by the molecular machinery of neurons. How the essence of a lived moment is encoded and later retrieved remains one of the central unanswered questions in neuroscience.

Sacktor became a neuroscientist in pursuit of an answer. At the State University of New York Downstate in Brooklyn, he studies the molecules involved in maintaining the neuronal connections underlying memory. The question that has always held his attention was first articulated in 1984 by the famed biologist Francis Crick: How can memories persist for years, even decades, when the body's molecules degrade and are replaced in a matter of days, weeks or, at most, months?

In 2024, working alongside a team that included his longtime collaborator André Fenton, a neuroscientist at New York University, Sacktor offered a potential explanation in a paper published in Science Advances. The researchers discovered that a persistent bond between two proteins is associated with the strengthening of synapses, which are the connections between neurons. Synaptic strengthening is thought to be fundamental to memory formation. As these proteins degrade, new ones take their place in a connected molecular swap that maintains the bond's integrity and, therefore, the memory.

In 1984, Francis Crick described a biological conundrum: Memories last years, while most molecules degrade in days or weeks. “How then is memory stored in the brain so that its trace is relatively immune to molecular turnover?” he wrote in Nature.

The researchers present “a very convincing case” that “the interaction between these two molecules is needed for memory storage,” said Karl Peter Giese, a neurobiologist at King's College London who was not involved with the work. The findings offer a compelling response to Crick's dilemma, reconciling the discordant timescales to explain how ephemeral molecules maintain memories that last a lifetime.

Early in his career, Sacktor made a discovery that would shape the rest of his life. After studying under the molecular memory pioneer James Schwartz at Columbia University, he opened his own lab at SUNY Downstate to search for a molecule that might help explain how long-term memories persist.

The molecule he was looking for would be in the brain's synapses. In 1949, the psychologist Donald Hebb proposed that repeatedly activating neurons strengthens the connections between them, or, as the neurobiologist Carla Shatz later put it: “Cells that fire together, wire together.” In the decades since, many studies have suggested that the stronger the connection between neurons that hold memories, the better the memories persist.

In the early 1990s, in a dish in his lab, Sacktor stimulated a slice of a rat's hippocampus—a small region of the brain linked to memories of events and places, such as the interaction Sacktor had with his sister in the den—to activate neural pathways in a way that mimicked memory encoding and storage. Then he searched for any molecular changes that had taken place. Every time he repeated the experiment, he saw elevated levels of a certain protein within the synapses. “By the fourth time, I was like, this is it,” he said.

It was protein kinase M zeta, or PKMζ for short. As the rats' hippocampal tissue was stimulated, synaptic connections strengthened and levels of PKMζ increased. By the time he published his findings in 1993, he was convinced that PKMζ was crucial for memory.

Todd Sacktor has devoted his career to pursuing the molecular nature of memory.

Over the next two decades, he would go on to build a body of work showing that PKMζ's presence helps maintain memories long after their initial formation. When Sacktor blocked the molecule's activity an hour after a memory was formed, he saw that synaptic strengthening was reversed. This discovery suggested that PKMζ was “necessary and sufficient” to preserve a memory over time, he wrote in Nature Neuroscience in 2002. In contrast, hundreds of other localized molecules impacted synaptic strengthening only if disrupted within a few minutes of a memory's formation. It appeared to be a singular molecular key to long-term memory.

To test his hypothesis in live animals, he teamed up with Fenton, who worked at SUNY Downstate at the time and had experience training lab animals and running behavioral experiments. In 2006, the duo published their first paper showing that blocking PKMζ could erase rats' memories a day or a month after they had formed. This suggested that the persistent activity of PKMζ is required to maintain a memory.

The paper was a bombshell. Sacktor and Fenton's star protein PKMζ gained widespread attention, and labs around the world found that blocking it could erase various types of memories, including those related to fear and taste. PKMζ seemed like a sweeping explanation for how memories form and are maintained at the molecular level. But then their hypothesis lost momentum. Other researchers genetically engineered mice to lack PKMζ, and in 2013, two independent studies showed that these mice could still form memories. This cast doubt on the protein's role and brought much of the ongoing research to a halt.

Sacktor and Fenton were undeterred. “We knew we had to figure it out,” Sacktor said. In 2016, they published a rebuttal, demonstrating that in the absence of PKMζ, mice recruit a backup mechanism, involving another molecule, to strengthen synapses.

The existence of a compensatory molecule wasn't a surprise. “The biological system is not such that you lose one molecule and everything goes. That's very rare,” Giese said. But identifying this compensatory molecule prompted a new question: How did it know where to go to replace PKMζ? It would take Sacktor and Fenton nearly another decade to find out.

A classic test of a molecule's importance is to block it and see what breaks. Determined to pin down PKMζ's role once and for all, Sacktor and Fenton set out to design a way to disrupt it more precisely than ever before. They developed a new molecule to inhibit the activity of PKMζ. It “worked beautifully,” Sacktor said. But it wasn't clear how.

One day in 2020, Matteo Bernabo, a graduate student from a collaborating lab at McGill University, was presenting findings related to the PKMζ inhibitor when a clue emerged from the audience. “I suggested that it worked by blocking the PKMζ's interaction with KIBRA,” recalled Wayne Sossin, a neuroscientist at McGill.

KIBRA is a scaffolding protein. Like an anchor, it holds other proteins in place inside a synapse. In the brain, it is abundant in regions associated with learning and memory. “It's not a protein that a lot of people work on,” Sossin said, but there is considerable “independent evidence that KIBRA has something to do with memory”—and even that it is associated with PKMζ. Most research has focused on KIBRA's role in cancer. “In the nervous system,” he said, “there are only three or four of us [studying it].” Sacktor and Fenton joined them.

André Fenton and his team found that an interaction between two proteins is key to keeping memory intact over time.

To find out if KIBRA and PKMζ work together in response to synaptic activity, the researchers used a technique that makes interacting proteins glow. When they applied electrical pulses to hippocampal slices, glowing dots of evidence appeared: Following bursts of synaptic activity that produced long-term synaptic strengthening, a multitude of KIBRA-PKMζ complexes formed, and they were persistent.

Then the team tested the bond during real memory formation by giving mice a drug to disrupt the formation of these complexes. They saw that the mice's synaptic strength and task memory were lost—and that once the drug wore off, the erased memory did not return, but the mice could acquire and remember new memories once again.

But are the KIBRA-PKMζ complexes needed to maintain memory over the long term? To find out, the researchers disrupted the complex four weeks after a memory was formed. Doing so did indeed wipe out the memory. This suggested that the interaction between KIBRA and PKMζ is crucial not only for forming memories, but also for keeping them intact over time.

“It's the persistent association between two proteins that maintains the memory, rather than a protein that lasts by itself for the lifetime of the memory,” said Panayiotis Tsokas, a neuroscientist working with Sacktor and lead author on the new Science Advances paper.

The KIBRA and PKMζ proteins stabilize each other by forming a bond. That way, when a protein degrades and needs to be replaced, the other remains in place. The bond itself and its location at the specific synapses that were activated during learning are preserved, allowing a new partner to slot itself in, perpetuating the alliance over time. Individually, PKMζ and KIBRA don't last a lifetime—but by binding to each other, they help ensure your memories might.

The discovery addresses the conundrum first identified by Crick, namely how memories persist despite the relatively short lifetimes of all biological molecules. “There had to be a very, very interesting answer, an elegant answer, for how this could come about,” Fenton said. “And that elegant answer is the KIBRA-PKMζ interacting story.”

This work also answers a question that researchers had put on the shelf. Sacktor's earlier study showed that increasing levels of PKMζ strengthened synapses and memories. But how did the molecule know where to go within the neuron? “We figured, well, one day, maybe we'll understand that,” Sacktor said. Now, the researchers think that KIBRA acts as a synaptic tag that guides PKMζ. If true, this would help explain how only the specific synapses involved in a particular physical memory trace are strengthened, when a neuron may have thousands of synapses that connect it to various other cells.

“These experiments very nicely show that KIBRA is necessary for maintaining the activity of PKMζ at the synapse,” said David Glanzman, a neurobiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the study. However, he cautioned that this doesn't necessarily translate to maintaining memory because synaptic strengthening is not the only model for how memory works.

Glanzman's own past research on sea slugs at first appeared to show that disrupting a molecule analogous to PKMζ erases memory. “Originally, I said it was erased,” Glanzman said, “but later experiments showed we could bring the memory back.” These findings prompted him to reconsider whether memory is truly stored as changes in the strength of synaptic connections. Glanzman, who has worked for 40 years under the synaptic model, is a recent proponent of an alternative view called the molecular-encoding model, which posits that molecules inside a neuron store memories.

While he has no doubt that synaptic strengthening follows memory formation, and that PKMζ plays a major role in this process, he remains unsure if the molecule also stores the memory itself. Still, Glanzman emphasized that this study addresses some of the challenges of the synaptic model, such as molecular turnover and synapse targeting, by “providing evidence that KIBRA and PKMζ form a complex that is synapse-specific and persists longer than either individual molecule.”

Although Sacktor and Fenton believe that this protein pair is fundamental to memory, they know that there may be other factors yet to be discovered that help memories persist. Just as PKMζ led them to KIBRA, the complex might lead them further still.

Companies have struggled to adopt the right AI tools as the technology evolves at a far faster pace than their slow sales cycles. 

Corporate credit card company Brex is no different. The startup found itself facing the same issue as its enterprise counterparts. The upshot: Brex completely changed its approach to software procurement to ensure they wouldn't get left behind.

Brex CTO James Reggio told TechCrunch, at the HumanX AI conference in March, the company initially tried to assess these software tools through their usual procurement strategy. The startup quickly discovered its months-long piloting process was just not going to work.

“In the first year following ChatGPT, when all these new tools were coming on the scene, the process itself of procuring would actually run so long that the teams that were asking to procure a tool lost interest in the tool by the time that we actually got through all of the necessary internal controls,” Reggio said.

That's when Brex realized had to completely rethink its procurement process.

The company started by coming up with a new framework for data processing agreements and legal validations for bringing on AI tools, Reggio said. This allowed Brex to vet potential AI tools quicker and get them into the hands of testers faster.

Reggio said the company uses a “superhuman product-market-fit test” to figure out what tools are worth investing in beyond the pilot program. This approach gives employees a much larger role in deciding what tools the company should adopt based on where they are finding value, he added.

“We go deep with the folks who are getting the most value out of the tool to figure out whether it is actually unique enough to retain,” Reggio said. “We're basically, I would say, about two years into this new era where there's 1,000 AI tools within our company. And we've definitely canceled and not renewed on maybe five to 10 different larger deployments.”

Brex gives its engineers a monthly budget of $50 to license whichever software tools they want from an approved list.

“By delegating that spending authority to the individuals who are going to be leveraging this, they make the optimal decisions for optimizing their workflows,” Reggio said. “It's actually really interesting and we haven't seen a convergence. I think that that has also validated the decision to make it easy to try a bunch of different tools, is that we haven't seen everybody just rush in and say, ‘I want Cursor.'”

This approach has helped the company figure out where it needs broader licensing deals for software too based on a more accurate headcount of how many engineers are using what.

Overall, Reggio said the best way for enterprises to approach the current AI innovation cycle, in his opinion, is to “embrace the messiness” and know that figuring out which tools to adopt will be a bumpy process and that's okay.

“Knowing that you're not going to always make the right decision out of the gate is just like paramount to making sure that you don't get left behind,” Reggio said. “I think that the one mistake that we could make is to overthink this and spend six to nine months evaluating everything very carefully before we deploy it. And you don't know what the world is going to look like nine months from now.”

In a delicious turn of events, scientists succeeded in taking the optics of olive oil to create the first-ever microlaser made entirely from edible materials. If commercialized, they could offer an easy and safe way to monitor food or medications from inside your body.

The technology, introduced earlier this month in the journal Advanced Optical Materials, exploits an interesting tendency for droplets of common cooking oils, which emit a photon of light when subjected to a certain amount of energy. Arrange multiple droplets in a room full of mirrors, and together they shine more brightly—like a concentrated beam of light. 

The researchers tested more than a dozen different types of materials—sunflower oil, cooked butter, plain water, and more—to see which would generate the cleanest laser. And the winner was olive oil. 

One prominent component of olive oil is chlorophyll, the molecule most commonly known to make plants green. In this case, the chlorophyll molecules, trapped in the sticky surface of olive oils, generated photons in a chain reaction of sorts, transforming the droplet of olive oil into a laser. 

The brightness of the chlorophyll changes in accordance with the size and density of the oil droplets, making the laser highly sensitive to environmental conditions, according to the study. For example, adding it to different dishes of food and observing changes in the  laser allowed the researchers to measure things such as sugar concentration or acidity

What's more, the researchers were able to encode data within the droplets akin to the lines of a barcode, into a peach compote. Surprisingly, the data—the specific date of April 26, 2017, which happens to be the first international Stop Food Waste Date—remained intact for over a year, demonstrating the microlaser's potential to safely carry information, such as the identity of a manufacturer or an expiration date. 

“Since this is the first such study, there are many possibilities for developing various edible lasers and their applications, which could ultimately find their way to everyday use,” the study authors concluded.

Amazon rolled out its initial Prime Day offers this weekend, in the form of the Prime Early Deal event. You have to be a Prime member to qualify for these exclusive offers but if you are not a member, Amazon offers a free 30-day trial so you can take advantage of all the Prime Day sales.

Among many active noise cancelation headphones out there, Sony remains in the top brands and its WH-1000XM4 model is as mature as the newest version. Thanks to the Prime Day sale, you can have the WH-1000XM4 for nearly three times less than the new one, and it's an all-time low.

Right now, the Sony 1000XM4 headphones are available for just $185 on Amazon, down from the original $348 list price. That's a huge 47% discount which makes this the perfect time to invest in premium audio gear.

The WH-1000XM4 offers a great listening experience and it is powered by industry-leading active noise cancellation with dual noise sensor technology. Commuting, working in an open office space, or at home: these headphones cancel distractions and let you stay on your music or calls. The adaptive sound control system automatically adjusts the noise cancellation based on your environment and activities and offers you a tailor-made audio experience with each use.

Battery life is also really impressive if you go for thus one: You get 30 hours of playback from a single charge, and in case you run late, a 10-minute charge can give you a maximum of five hours of music time. USB Type-C is employed here for charging the headphones which is handy because you can use the same cable to charge a lot of modern devices.

You'll simply control your music and calls with touch sensor controls on the earcups: Play, pause, skip songs, adjust the volume, activate your voice assistant, and answer a call with a touch or swipe. The speak-to-chat feature is also a pleasant touch and automatically lowers volume as you start talking so you don't have to navigate through controls.

Music lovers will love the DSEE Extreme engine co-developed with Sony Music Studios Tokyo, which upscales compressed digital music files in real time for richer, more detailed sound.

Keep in mind that at $185 during Prime Day, it's an offer that you shouldn't resist.

A troubling new trend is crystallizing in the tech industry. A company at the forefront of AI development lays off thousands of its human employees, then encourages them to seek comfort from the very technology supplanting them. It's the automation of suffering, and it's happening now.

This week, Matt Turnbull, an Executive Producer at Xbox Game Studios Publishing, became a case study. Following Microsoft's decision to cut thousands jobs from its gaming division, Turnbull took to LinkedIn. With what seems like good intentions, he encouraged former employees to turn to AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot to manage the emotional and logistical fallout.

“These are really challenging times, and if you're navigating a layoff or even quietly preparing for one, you're not alone and you don't have to go it alone,” his post began. “I know these types of tools engender strong feelings in people, but I'd be remiss in not trying to offer the best advice I can under the circumstances.”

He continued: “I've been experimenting with ways to use LLM AI tools (like ChatGPT or Copilot) to help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.”

AI Is Not in the Memo, but It Haunts Every Layoff at Xbox

The message landed with a surreal thud. Microsoft, which just ended your employment, was now outsourcing your emotional support to a bot. The  July layoffs hit Xbox Game Studios. Alongside the job cuts, Microsoft announced that ambitious titles like Perfect Dark and Everwild are being canceled, and at least one studio, The Initiative, one of Microsoft's newer, high-profile studios, is being closed entirely. In his now deleted post captured by Aftermath, Turnbull even offered prompt templates to help the newly unemployed start their conversations with the AI.

These folks are absolute sociopaths. pic.twitter.com/TSoqUvBnlH

— Julien Eveillé – THRESHOLD 30% OFF (@PATALOON) July 4, 2025



 

He categorized the prompts like a self help guide for the digital age:

Career Planning

Resume & LinkedIn Help

Networking & Outreach

Emotional Clarity & Confidence

The message is clear: AI is your new therapist and outplacement service, rolled into one. Where a hefty severance package from a large corporation once included connections to human career coaches, AI now appears to be the cheaper, more scalable solution.

While the prompts themselves may be useful, the gesture feels hollow coming from a leader at the company responsible for the layoffs. This is a stark redefinition of corporate care: outsourced, AI assisted, and quietly depersonalized. It's a chilling reframing of the social contract, where even empathy is routed through software.

This is the tech world's cynical feedback loop. The same industry obsessed with automating jobs is now positioning its products as the cure for the emotional damage it inflicts. Microsoft, which has invested over $13 billion into OpenAI, has a direct financial stake in this solution. When an executive at a Microsoft owned studio promotes ChatGPT or its own Copilot as the first resource for the unemployed, it blurs the line between genuine concern and brand alignment.

Empathy becomes a use case. Trauma becomes another customer journey.

Traditionally, outplacement services offered a human touch. As LLMs become more powerful, the corporate pressure to automate post layoff support will only grow. A chatbot can rewrite your resume, coach you for interviews, and talk you down from a mental spiral, at least in theory.

But what gets lost in that shift? What happens to the human dignity of grief, reflection, and real connection during a time of professional crisis?

Even Turnbull acknowledged the tension in his post: “No AI tool is a replacement for your voice or your lived experience. But at a time when mental energy is scarce, these tools can help get you unstuck faster, calmer, and with more clarity.”

Turnbull's post isn't an isolated incident; it's a flare signaling a major cultural shift in tech, where recovery is being privatized, individualized, and automated. There's a strange, unnerving optimism embedded in all this: the belief that you can prompt your way out of pain.

But pain isn't a productivity issue. And a layoff isn't a user experience problem. If the only support a worker receives is from a chatbot trained on the internet's vast archive of trauma, we are witnessing the dawn of something much darker than a downturn. We are seeing the first wave of algorithmic grief management, sanctioned by the very forces that deemed human workers disposable in the first place.

You'd better get the Switch 2 console before tariffs strike.

President Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam, which puts a 20% tariff on all goods originating from the country. This might seem like a good deal, especially as the latter originally had a 46% tariff before Trump paused the tariffs he put on all the U.S.'s trade partners for 90 days, dropping down the numbers to just 10%. Unfortunately, Nintendo, which manufactures the Switch 2 consoles in Vietnam, used the 10% tariff amount for its earnings forecast, according to PCMag. This means that the tariff change may throw a wrench into its plans.

The Nintendo Switch 2 launch has been relatively successful, with the company selling 3.5 million units on the opening weekend and obliterating the record of the original Switch by a full million. But despite seemingly arriving in good numbers in the U.S. and the U.K., customers from other countries have complained of shortages, with its president, Shuntaro Furukawa, apologizing to shareholders for failing to anticipate the massive demand.

It has also been a victim of geopolitics, with the console revealed to the world on April 2, 2025 — the same day that Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs, which imposed massive taxes on Vietnamese goods. This meant that the $449 launch price of the console might no longer be viable and could force Nintendo and its retailers to hike up their prices. This led to a delay in pre-orders, as the company was probably considering its next moves. Thankfully, these massive tariffs were suspended for 90 days starting April 9, even though a base 10% tariff remained. Despite that, Nintendo was able to retain the original launch price console and had pre-orders starting on April 24 — accessories saw modest price increases, though.

One thing that the company counted on was that the tariffs for Vietnamese goods would remain at 10%. However, this is not the case, and the recent tariff increase might be too much for the company to absorb the changes. As of now, there is no finalized official document, yet, that confirms these changes, so we don't know if and when this will take effect. Nintendo is likely holding its breath until everything is finalized before making an announcement. But if the 20% tariff is implemented, we might see the price of the Switch 2 jump from $450 to $500.

COD's anti-cheat proves no match for hackers.

Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2023 promised to usher in a new era of harmony between PC and console. As such, Activision's marquee title, Call of Duty, has been slowly making its way over to Xbox and PC Game Pass. Now backed by an unfaltering tech giant, Call of Duty has maintained the servers for their older live-service games despite the franchise's annual release cadence. One of these games is Call of Duty: WWII, released in 2017 and still going strong in 2025... up until it was hacked to oblivion over the weekend.

COD: WW2 landed on Game Pass a few days ago, enabling millions to try the game for the first time, and while everything was going smooth over on the console side, mayhem ensued across the PC sector. According to various reports online, hackers have apparently taken over the game with the help of RCE exploits, leading to some relentless trolling.

Gamers are going ballisticCall of Duty WWII, available on Xbox PC Game Pass, contains an unpatched RCE exploitSomeone is trolling gamers with Notepad pop ups, PC shutdowns, and gay pornography pic.twitter.com/FLNzRbLt1sJuly 3, 2025

For context, RCE stands for remote code execution and is a way of running malicious code on a computer without actually needing to be there in person. The bad actor gets access to your computer through loopholes in the security system, then injects a payload containing said malicious code that can wreak havoc on your computer. So far, there have been no reports of any serious harm done to COD: WWII players, but this is a dangerous tactic, nonetheless.

It's important to note that such exploits can only really work on PC since consoles do not provide the level of code execution freedom a conventional computer does, in order to pursue these shenanigans. Obviously, consoles do get hacked, but this particular issue is exclusive to PC and, unfortunately, has been a common occurrence with older COD titles for a long time.

Activision introduced its ""Ricochet"" anti-cheat system in 2019—with COD: Modern Warfare—to combat things like this. Since then, the publisher has iterated on the tech with Ricochet 2, making its anti-cheat harder and harder to crack. Therefore, without the level of protection needed against malicious operators, COD: WWII, which came out two years prior to Ricochet's introduction, is apparently fair game for hacking.

Moreover, COD: WWII still relies on P2P matchmaking, an archaic way of connecting two players (and their computers) together in order to enable multiplayer. This method has been succeeded with a dedicated server model in which all players connect to the server, which receives their input and sends it back and forth in real-time. As you could probably guess, directly connecting two players to each other leaves a lot of vulnerability on the table, which hackers exploited in the case of COD: WWII.

In response to this, Activision has since taken the game offline from the Microsoft Store, for some reason, despite the game still being available on Steam and PC Game Pass. It doesn't matter where you get the game from, the entirety of the PC platform is affected by this, so please avoid playing Call of Duty: WWII until this matter is resolved.

📢 Call of Duty: WWIICall of Duty: WWII on PC Microsoft Store was brought offline while we investigate reports of an issueJuly 5, 2025

The damage, however, has already been done with several users being hacked over the weekend. In one video uploaded to X, a streamer got hacked while they were live and their desktop wallpaper was quickly changed to show an Activision lawyer. More interestingly, though, @LasagneManne revealed what looks like the exact tool these hackers are using to pull off their exploits. It includes standard options like kicking players off the server or enabling things like ""God Mode,"" alongside the RCE button. Let's hope Activision has a patch ready to address this unfettered access soon enough.

U.S. Men's National Team head coach Mauricio Pochettino addressed the team and staff ahead of the Concacaf Gold Cup Final. He thanked the players for making it to this point and the staff for supporting the team along the way. Pochettino also shared a dream he had.

“It was about winning and lifting the trophy,” midfielder Malik Tillman said. “So, if you believe in that [dream], I think we have a good chance to do this.”

Pochettino looks to earn his first title at the helm of the USMNT after he was hired less than a year ago.

Before the USA fulfills the dream, the Americans will have to go through their biggest rival, Mexico. The match kicks off from NRG Stadium in Houston on Sunday at 7 p.m. ET.

Here are five things to know for the Gold Cup Final: 

When one thinks of soccer rivalries, the first image to pop up is more than likely USMNT vs. Mexico. The two teams have sparred 78 times, the most of any USA opponent.

El Tri holds a 37-24-17 record over the USA. They've met in the Gold Cup eight times, seven in the final. The USMNT won the most recent matchup between the two teams in 2021 after Miles Robinson scored the game-winner in extra time. However, Mexico has won five of those seven finals. The other USA win came in 2007.

Mexico holds the most Gold Cup titles with nine, as the USA looks to earn its eighth. These two nations have dominated Concacaf's premier tournament, with only one of the 18 total finals not featuring at least one of the squads.

The USA, thanks to midfielder Diego Luna, got off to a lightning-fast start in the quarterfinal versus Mexico. Luna scored in the fourth minute, then he capped off a brace in the 15th minute, putting the United States in position to win 2-1.

Eight of the last 10 finals — both Gold Cup and Nations League — between the USMNT and Mexico have been won by the team that scored first. However, if there should be a comeback, it's happened twice in history, both times coming from the USA side in the 2021 Nations League and the 2007 Gold Cup.

Starting fast is always the objective, but it may be even more important in this one to swing momentum toward the USA. In the quarterfinal, Luna's two goals quieted the many Guatemala supporters in the crowd. It will likely be a similar situation at NRG Stadium with Mexico fans.



It's been the first Gold Cup for several young players, but it also could be the last for a USMNT stalwart. Tim Ream, 37, has captained this squad for every match of this tournament, and he's looking to finish it by lifting the trophy.

“I've been in this program for 15 years,” Ream said. “It's my fourth Gold Cup. I've not won one, and this more than likely is my last Gold Cup. So, to be able to win one, have it be my last,I'm excited.”

Ream has been to two Gold Cup Finals in 2011 and 2019. Both were losses to Mexico.

For the first time in this tournament, the USMNT enter a match as underdogs with the majority picking the reigning Gold Cup and Nations League champions, Mexico, to win. But the USA is comfortable with that. Many weren't sure the U.S., with a relatively inexperienced team with several young players, would even make it this far.

However, that's not what's motivating the U.S. As players spoke to the media Saturday, the large gold trophy sat on a podium off to the side, and that is what's fueling them to come out with a win.

“It's one game to lift a trophy,” Ream said. “It doesn't matter if you're the underdog or you're the favorite. You still have to go out there and play at least 90 minutes to finish a game. And for us, that's all the motivation we need — is that that trophy right there.

The USMNT got to the final through Group D, beating Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti to finish the group matches with nine points. Then, the USA knocked out Costa Rica in an epic penalty shootout in the quarterfinal and defeated Guatemala 2-1 in the semifinal.

Mexico finished No. 1 in Group A, defeating the Dominican Republic, Suriname and drawing with Costa Rica. Mexico won the group's tiebreaker over Costa Rica by scoring one more goal in the group stage. Then,El Tri outlasted Panama in penalties in the quarterfinal and took down Honduras 1-0 in the semis.

Luna and midfielder Malik Tillman lead the USA in scoring so far this tournament with three goals apiece. They both added two assists as well, which is tied for second in the tournament. Defender Max Arfsten leads the category with three assists.

Defender César Montes, with three goals, leads the way for Mexico's squad. Forward Raúl Jiménez has added two, including the go-ahead score in the semifinal.

It all comes down to this.

It's the United States Men's National Team versus Mexico in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup Final.

The USMNT took care of business with a 2-1 win over Guatemala in the semifinals, with midfielder Diego Luna scoring two goals in the opening 15 minutes of the game on Wednesday night.

In the other semifinal, Mexico forward Raul Jimenez scored the lone goal in the 50th minute in a 1-0 win over Honduras to advance to the title game.

This is the first meeting between the two bordering countries since Oct. 15, 2024, when Mexico defeated the United States 2-0 in an international friendly It was the USMNT's first loss against Mexico since 2019.

There should be no surprise here that it'll either be the United States or Mexico crowned as champions.

Since the Concacaf Gold Cup was established in 1991, either the U.S. or Mexico has won 16 of the 17 bi-annual tournaments. The lone exception was Canada in 2000.

Will USMNT claim their first Gold Cup trophy since 2021 or will Mexico win the tournament for a second consecutive time?

This particular Gold Cup roster came into camp with just an average of 16 caps. There were a lot of question marks entering the tournament as to whether this rather inexperienced USMNT squad was talented and capable enough to lift the Concacaf trophy in July.

Several USMNT mainstays missed the Gold Cup due to injury, the FIFA Club World Cup or personal reasons, but the players on the roster saw it as an opportunity to tune out the noise and write their own story.

“We've dealt with a lot of adversity, but we've done it with a lot of heart,” defender Chris Richards said. “I think that's been the big thing this summer.”

The summer didn't start easily with two losses to UEFA teams, Türkiye and Switzerland, in international friendlies in early June. However, the USA quickly turned the page in the Gold Cup and didn't look back. The Americans came out of Group D on top, winning all three group matches. Then they knocked out Costa Rica and Guatemala in the quarter and semifinals, respectively.

“We're all eyes on Houston, and we want to win a whole trophy,” Richards said.

The USA will face Mexico in the Gold Cup Final at NRG Stadium on July 6 (7 p.m. ET on FOX).

Fellow center back and veteran leader Tim Ream said that this opportunity wasn't just happenstance. It was an intentional effort to develop chemistry on and off the field.

“What happens on the field doesn't just magically appear,” Ream said. “It takes time, and it's something that we've cultivated throughout these last four weeks. Without all the togetherness, without fighting for each other, without standing shoulder to shoulder, without having each other's backs, we don't get to this point to be able to fight for that.”

The knockout round proved to be the biggest catalyst in bringing the team together— a penalty shootout in the quarterfinal and a physical, competitive semifinal.

Now, the USMNT will face its biggest rival El Tri, for the eighth time in a Gold Cup Final. Its southern neighbor is favored over the Americans, and for the first time this tournament the U.S. enters a match as the underdog.

This isn't anything new for this group. They came into the tournament feeling overlooked, and now hope to finish as champions.

“It's something as players, you always want to be able to do,” Ream said. “You want to be able to play for trophies, you want to win trophies. And so, now here we are.”

...

HOUSTON — The Luna family would gather whenever fútbol called them, but especially, invariably, for occasions like this one. Roughly once per year, parents, siblings and others would assemble around a TV for a soccer game that, as the youngest son now says, is “in my blood.” The U.S. and Mexico men's national teams would meet in Ohio or Mexico City, in Chicago or Pasadena. And back in Sunnyvale, California, the Lunas, like thousands of Mexican American families, would cook up hamburgers or enchiladas; don their favorite jerseys; and cheer or cry through a rivalry that divides and unites.

So they would surely gather again on Sunday (7 p.m. ET, Fox/Univision), for the eighth Gold Cup final between the two North American neighbors if not for an extraordinary twist: That youngest son, Diego Luna, will be playing.

Diego, 21, has clawed his way toward the core of the USMNT. With nose fractured or intact, with hair bleached blonde or hat backward, he has become the humble, gritty, tattooed, mustachioed face of the national team's rebuild. He soared into a new stratosphere of fame with two goals in a semifinal win over Guatemala. Now, he is “super excited” to walk into NRG Stadium and “play a game that I've dreamt of as a little kid.”

And he's emotional.

“That's just part of being human, right?” he said Saturday. “You're gonna have these emotions. It's how you grew up. It's part of your family. It's in your blood.”

But no, he is not conflicted. Many immigrants and children of immigrants feel attached to both teams when their adoptive country and their family's country meet in a soccer match. Diego never was.

His parents, who emigrated from Michoacán, Mexico, would celebrate El Tri goals. Little Diego would throw fits. “Half the family would be rooting for Mexico, half the family would be for USA,” he recalled. That led to “little comments” and intra-family “beef.”

Over time, he grew proud of his heritage. “I love being Mexican,” he told American Soccer Now in 2022. “But I grew up in the United States.” He could've represented either nation's soccer team. “It's only right to play for the country that raised me to who I am,” he said.

His commitment never seemed to waver, even when U.S. Olympic coaches snubbed him last summer. And even when, 15 minutes into his first start under USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino, a Costa Rican elbow broke his nose and bloodied him. Luna pleaded with coaches and doctors: Let me stay in. Mere moments after returning to the field, with his nostrils plugged, he delivered an assist.

""He showed great character,” Pochettino said afterward — and “big balls.” But it was more than just a viral moment. “That is what I want,” Pochettino said more recently. It's the “attitude, hunger, desire” that the head coach has begged for. And just as other, more prominent players seemed to lack those attributes, Luna showed, as Pochettino said, that “he is desperate to play for this shirt, for the national team.

“And that is why, now, he's [at] the level that he's showing.”

That, in many ways, is why Diego Luna is a professional soccer player at all. Born in the Bay Area and raised by a family that “[wasn't] the wealthiest,” he trekked down a circuitous path that, at times, he forged himself. He began under the tutelage of his father and older brother, with a ball at his feet five hours per day, often playing against boys who were two or three years older — and “bigger, faster, stronger.” Then, at 15, he left home.

He'd been feeling stuck at the San Jose Earthquakes academy. And school wasn't his thing. So he moved to Casa Grande, Arizona, where the Barça Residency Academy lives on a megacomplex of dorms, classrooms and fields in the middle of the desert. At first, he felt homesick. But he committed to the grind, and over time, his legend grew. His relentless creativity endeared him to peers. Youth national teams took notice.

Some scouts, though, were skeptical. They saw a positionless attacker with an atypically stocky, barrel-chested build. “There were a lot of doubters for Diego,” one of his youth coaches, Ged Quinn, told Backheeled. A torn meniscus also halted his progress. As his 18th birthday approached, many wondered whether he'd ever succeed against adults.

So, at 17, he set out to prove he could. He signed with the El Paso Locomotive, a second-tier club in the USL Championship. He recently explained the decision to Unfiltered Soccer: “When you go to MLS Next Pro [Major League Soccer's reserve division], you're gonna be playing against academy players, or guys that are young kids. When you go into USL Championship, that's a division of grown men. … Going into that environment, you're still competing against faster, stronger guys, and you're proving yourself.”

El Paso assumed he'd need time to adjust. Instead, within a couple months, Luna was starting. A year later, he was off to Real Salt Lake in MLS. That's where he pledged to become a two-way player; and developed into a senior national team prospect; and, perhaps most importantly, became a more well-rounded person.

Soon after moving to Utah, Luna crafted an old-school résumé, sent it to a local coffee shop, and interviewed for a position as … a barista. He'd go work his second job after training, less to make money, more to improve his interpersonal skills, which were lacking. He'd spent so much of his adolescence with his head down on soccer. He'd built a lifelong connection with the ball; he needed to learn how to build connections with people, via things like eye contact and conversation.

He also struggled mentally in his early years as a pro. And that, in 2024, is what led him to seek out a therapist. There was a lot going on in his life. (In addition to the demands of pro soccer and young adulthood, in September 2023, he became a father.) With the therapist, he worked on clearing his head — on “affirmations, breathing exercises, power poses … mindfulness, being present.” It was something “I struggled with a lot,” he told Apple TV. He wrote the affirmations and jotted down lessons in a notebook, which he could refer back to before games.

Less than a week after he started therapy, he scored his first goal of the 2024 season. Seven months later, he was MLS Young Player of the Year. Two months after that, he was in USMNT camp.

And in an otherwise meaningless B-team friendly against Costa Rica, he had a choice.

His nose was busted, and he “could take the easy way, and hop off.” Or, as he told Unfiltered Soccer, he could “grab [his] chance and go for it.”

Pochettino, Luna recently recounted, told him: “It's OK, you don't have to rush it, it's preseason.”

Luna asked for a chance to at least see out the first half. And he seized it.

He eventually departed at halftime, went to a hospital and underwent surgery. By the time he awoke, his family and agent were calling him “Big Balls,” and, still woozy, he initially panicked: Is my hospital gown loose? Then he learned of Pochettino's comment, and the meaning behind it. He later realized: Playing through the broken nose “might've been the best decision of my life.”

The entire experience, Luna said last month, “was life-changing.” It earned him an A-team call-up in March. And as the USMNT's stars slumped to two defeats, Luna was the one player Pochettino singled out in a positive light. “The desire and the hunger that he showed is what we want,” Pochettino said after a 2-1 loss to Canada. “When I told [him] today, ‘You are going to play,' he was red. … That is the example, for me, that we need to take.”

A couple months later, Luna was named to this Gold Cup roster. Reflecting on the January episode, he said: “I think it added an opportunity for me to come back into more camps and show the type of grit and the hunger that I have to play and represent for my country. Mauricio really liked that about me, and really liked the fight that I had. And I think that shows other players that that's what's needed in this team, to fight through everything.”

Whether that message has been received, Luna has continued fighting and sending it.

Playing as a left-sided attacking midfielder, with “confidence” and “comfort” and the freedom “to express myself,” he scored in a quarterfinal against Costa Rica, then twice in the semi against Guatemala. Afterward, Pochettino again raved: “Diego — that is all that we expect from a player.”

Luna himself spoke about “the grit” and “determination we've been lacking. … It's fighting to the end, every ball, every moment.” He spoke about the “honor” and “privilege” of playing in these games for the USMNT. He spoke about going into them “free,” with “mental space” and “mental clearness.”

And whereas some teammates struggled in a cauldron of Guatemalan noise, shook by the intensity of the crowd and semifinal opponent, Luna said: “I loved it. It was awesome, man. That's what every game should be like.”

He knows that the next one, Sunday's final, will be even more “hostile.” He also knows it will unearth emotions, “a lot of emotions” — emotions that, as the current U.S. roster's only Mexican American, will be unique to him.

He felt them Saturday. He assumes he'll feel them Sunday. But come midday, he said, “it's about locking in.” It is a massive occasion, personally and professionally, perhaps the biggest moment of his young career. But when clocks here in Houston strike 6:06 p.m., and 70,000 people roar, he will simply have to do what he always does: “I'm gonna give 100% for the jersey that I'm wearing.”","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

HOUSTON — Asked what it would mean to win the Gold Cup in what would be his “last chance,” to lift the trophy, U.S. men's national team veteran Tim Ream's first response was to go with a joke.

“My last chance?” he responded, with a smirk. “Maybe. They've been telling me that for a long time.”

Ream has had a resurgence as a U.S. stalwart since being named to the World Cup roster in 2022. Now, the 37-year-old is the old man on a young U.S. team. As he turned back toward the microphone to finish his answer, Ream couldn't help but glance multiple times over at the trophy that was sitting to his right.

“We're excited. I'm excited,” he said. “I've been in this program for 15 years. It's my fourth Gold Cup. I've not won one yet, and as you said, this more than likely is my last Gold Cup. So, to be able to win one, have it be my last, I'm excited. I'm excited that we have an opportunity to play in a final and an opportunity to lift a trophy. And that's something that I think all of the guys are really looking forward to.”

Ream's words served as an important reminder of a common theme from Saturday's press conference, which featured five U.S. players as well as coach Mauricio Pochettino. The expectation repeated over and over again by the American contingent was that the U.S. aims to lift the trophy.

Yes, Mexico is the favorite. Yes, this U.S. group is missing several top players. That doesn't matter. They want to win.

“Because who is going to be in the memory of the people is who will win tomorrow and lift the trophy,” Pochettino said. “And the second(-place team), no one is going to remember.”

With his answer, Ream laid out that winning a trophy shouldn't be taken for granted. He's been chasing his for 15 years.

“It's one game to lift a trophy,” Ream said. “Doesn't matter if you're the underdog or you're the favorite, you still have to go out there and play at least 90 minutes to finish a game. And for us, that's all the motivation we need, is that trophy right there.”

For this group, the Gold Cup final holds an extra bit of importance beyond lifting the cup.

The U.S. lost four consecutive games going into the tournament. This specific group dropped two friendlies to talented European sides before the Concacaf tournament started. A 4-0 defeat to Switzerland was especially deflating — and concerning. Five wins over opponents that they were expected to beat — Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia, Haiti, Costa Rica and Guatemala — would feel far more substantial if the U.S. could cap the run with a win over Mexico.

The Americans will have to do so before a crowd that is likely to be heavily partisan in Mexico's favor. The U.S. was able to beat Guatemala in front of a stadium in St. Louis that felt more like a home game in Guatemala City. Mexico's advantage will be on a grander scale.

For many of the players on the team, it will be their first time playing on such a stage. It is a critical test as Pochettino weighs how this group will factor into the World Cup picture when his full pool is available for selection.

“It's good for us because I think it's going to be maybe the last game that we are going to play under pressure, and to play under pressure is what we need, the team needs, because we already qualified for the World Cup,” Pochettino said. “The games we play after are going to be friendly games. It's important that we have that difficult scenario to feel the pressure, to feel the stress. Because the World Cup is going to be about feeling the pressure and feeling the stress. It's great to have this opportunity.”

Mexico also faces pressure to win, and not just because it's facing what is largely viewed as a “B” team for the U.S.

Asked whether the current political climate for Mexicans in the U.S. created extra emotion or a further “obligation” to win, goalkeeper Luis Ángel Malagón, who has spoken of having family in the U.S., said it absolutely factors into how the team looks at the final.

“Yes, it's always going to be a challenge to win, more because of what I believe Mexico represents,” Malagón said. “At the end of the day, we're aware of what's happening outside of football, and on the field we try to give our all and do our best to bring satisfaction to those people who, as I mentioned in an earlier answer, we don't know what they might have to go through. So for us, yes, it's a topic that sometimes comes up at the table among the different points we discuss, and we're aware of it, it motivates us, it pushes us, and above all it gives us that responsibility to go for the title, which would be a satisfaction for everyone.”

Mauricio Pochettino has lost five of his 15 games in charge of the US

Mauricio Pochettino's start to life as head coach of the United States men's national team has not been as convincing as he and the fans would have liked, but a promising run in this summer's Gold Cup might have begun to turn things around.

A win against Mexico in Sunday's final would deliver a trophy and start the process of instilling some much-needed belief.

It's a victory that Pochettino and his players need if they are to demonstrate that things are moving in the right direction before a World Cup on home soil next summer.

By now, the US should have some clarity in their preparations for the 2026 tournament, but there remains an unfinished, rocky feel to the foundations they have been laying since Pochettino took over in September 2024.

Questions were being asked of the former Tottenham Hotspur and Paris St-Germain boss following consecutive defeats by Panama and Canada in the Nations League finals, and Turkey and Switzerland in Gold Cup warm-up games.

Though they were only friendlies, those last two losses had USMNT (United States Men's National Team) fans worried.

These games, more so than those against regional opponents, are seen as the type of test they will face in the World Cup - and they failed both.

With the big tournament less than a year away and only one more competitive game to play, it can be easy to slip into a last-minute panic.

There has been a lack of consistency in both personnel and results. The squad appears unresolved, with the group of players called up differing for each camp, something that has mostly been beyond Pochettino's control.

Fifty-five players have made appearances for the USA under the Argentine since he was appointed 10 months ago, making it difficult to build momentum and togetherness.

Mixed results across those 15 matches have reflected this inconsistency and during this time, they are yet to claim victory against a team in the top 30 of Fifa's rankings.

Goalkeeper Matt Freese and forward Malik Tillman have impressed during the United States' run to the final

The Gold Cup is Concacaf's Euros and Copa America equivalent. Sunday's final against Mexico is the United States' last competitive match before the World Cup, which explains the sense of urgency going into it.

Pochettino's side have experienced a promising campaign despite missing some key players. Their presence in the final reflects that progress.

It has been a bonding experience for the players involved, but it's likely the XI that starts their first World Cup game in Inglewood next June will look significantly different.

Due to a combination of injury, the Club World Cup and fatigue, this current squad is without familiar names such as Fulham's Antonee Robinson, Juventus pair Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah, AC Milan duo Yunus Musah and Christian Pulisic and Monaco striker Folarin Balogun.

Star man Pulisic's decision to rest this summer rather than take part in the Gold Cup was particularly controversial given the context of building for next year's home World Cup.

The players Pochettino has been able to call upon have developed into a useful unit as the tournament has progressed and it's the most together and determined a US group has looked since he took over.

He might wish this togetherness could have been created with his first-choice group but, on the other hand, it has given him a good chance to test fringe players in a competitive, high-pressure environment with a trophy on the line.

Some of this contingent have made a good case for inclusion in next summer's 26-man squad.

Diego Luna has long been touted as a player with the potential to offer the United States something they've been missing. The 21-year-old energetic playmaker, who plays his club football for Real Salt Lake in MLS, has come into his own in the Gold Cup as one of this team's star players.

In goal, Matt Freese, of Manchester City's US relative New York City, has been given the nod ahead of Nottingham Forest's Matt Turner all tournament and, bar one mistake against Haiti, has pushed for inclusion at the World Cup.

Freese's penalty shootout heroics in the quarter-final against Costa Rica gave him a tournament highlight, doing his chances of a 2026 call-up no harm at all.

Elsewhere, midfielder Jack McGlynn, who was also eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland, has showcased his talent on the international stage, Bayer Leverkusen-linked Malik Tillman has impressed in a role just off the striker, and Crystal Palace defender Chris Richards has strengthened his claim for a starting centre-back role.

Regardless of what happens against Mexico, this Gold Cup has been a useful experience and a productive exercise - but there's an argument it needed to be more.

Sooner rather than later, Pochettino needs to turn this work in progress into a fully prepared first-choice team.

If the Club World Cup is a World Cup warm-up for the US in an organisational sense, the Gold Cup is a warm-up for what they will look like as a host nation in terms of how its team plays and how it is supported.

Research from renowned US outlet Soccer America revealed that group-stage attendances have dropped compared to recent editions but, though disappointing, this isn't necessarily a sign of things to come at the World Cup.

The clash with the Club World Cup, the absence of familiar stars and ticket pricing issues across the game will have affected turnout but the semi-final in St Louis against Guatemala was sold out.

Guatemala had plenty of support too and at times it felt like it was their home game. Pochettino, 53, believes they can serve as an example for US fans.

""[That] connection between the fans and the team, that is the connection that we'd like to see in the World Cup,"" he said. ""That connection that makes you fly.""

The United States doing well and encouraging sports fans to connect with its men's team during 2026 feels more important for US soccer than merely hosting the World Cup.

The Gold Cup has been something of a tonic for Pochettino and the USMNT but the Mexico game is a similar test to those they failed to pass against Turkey and Switzerland.

This moment cares not for the profile of the competition nor the strength of the squad available to Pochettino. It cares about lifting the trophy.

Win, and they'll have met expectations in an impressively resolute fashion while missing some familiar stars. Lose, and the pre-World Cup panic will return.

FIFA Club World Cup

If the starting line-ups contain names such as Michael Olise, Jamal Musiala and Kingsley Coman on one side, with Bradley Barcola, Desire Doue and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia on the other, there is a high probability of entertainment.

Yet how both teams approach the game factors in whether we see the individual flair or not.

Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich didn't disappoint the audience on Saturday, with their proactive and positive approaches resulting in a thrilling match where Luis Enrique's side came out victorious.

PSG and Bayern played to the strengths of their forwards, focusing on isolating their wingers to get the best of their dribbling abilities. However, different methods were used to reach that target.

Luis Enrique's team wanted to shift Bayern's block towards one side of the pitch, by overloading that area, before switching the play quickly to put Barcola or Kvaratskhelia in an isolated situation.



In this example, Vitinha and Joao Neves are overloading the right side, which drags Joshua Kimmich and Aleksandar Pavlovic towards the touchline, with Bayern's right-back, Konrad Laimer, moving inside to mark Fabian Ruiz.

As Vitinha plays the ball to Fabian, Barcola attacks the space inside the pitch…



… and combines with the Spain midfielder, with Laimer completely out of position.

On the other side, Kvaratskhelia is free and calling for the pass…



… which Fabian plays in the space vacated by Laimer.

Meanwhile, Olise drops to cover for his right-back and intercepts the pass…



… but Kvaratskhelia wins the ball back. Doue then picks up the loose ball, but his shot misses the target.





Laimer's pressing role meant that if PSG could drag him out of position and switch the play in time, Kvaratskhelia would be in a one-versus-one situation against Dayot Upamecano.

Here, PSG are shifting the ball from the left side to the right to move Bayern's block, and Laimer is moving towards Fabian as Kimmich and Pavlovic are keeping an eye on Vitinha and Neves.



With Kimmich and Pavlovic in advanced positions, Achraf Hakimi plays the ball inside the pitch to find Barcola's run behind the midfield duo.



Once PSG penetrate Bayern's block, Laimer's pressing role becomes a liability because as he is marking Fabian in the centre of the pitch, Kvaratskhelia (out of shot) is in acres of space down the wing.

After Barcola receives Hakimi's pass, he dribbles inside…



… and switches the play to put Kvaratskhelia in a one-versus-one situation.



The Georgian dribbles past Upamecano with ease…



… but he is denied by a brilliant save from Manuel Neuer.



In another example, Vitinha, Neves and Fabian are near the left side of the pitch, and Willian Pacho immediately switches the play towards the right wing.



Barcola's immaculate first touch creates an isolated situation against Bayern's left-back, Josip Stanisic, because it allows him to control the ball before Kimmich and Pavlovic can shift across.



The right-winger then dribbles inside the pitch and drags Stanisic out of position, which allows PSG to combine and find Hakimi's third-man run.



The Morocco full-back then plays a low-curling ball across goal…



… but Kvaratskhelia only manages to hit the side-netting.



After the first-half cooling break, Vincent Kompany altered his side's pressing scheme by leaving the role of marking Fabian to Bayern's centre-backs, or Olise when PSG were building the attack on the other side.

By adjusting their pressing, Bayern stifled PSG's possession game and were able to have more time on the ball for the remaining hour.

Bayern's isolation method revolved around putting their full-backs in the half-spaces to create a direct passing lane into their wingers and prevent PSG from doubling up against them.



In this example, Laimer, who moved to left-back after Sacha Boey replaced Stanisic, plays the ball to Coman and attacks the space between Hakimi and Marquinhos.



Laimer's movement occupies Hakimi and creates a one-versus-one scenario for Coman, who dribbles past Neves twice…



… forcing PSG's right-back to change his focus and leave Laimer to Marquinhos.

This sequence of events means that Harry Kane has a bigger space to attack inside the penalty area if Bayern can find him with a cross. This happens when Coman dribbles past Neves again…



… and puts in a left-footed cross that the England striker heads over the bar.





In another example, Boey dashes forward in the right half-space to prevent Fabian from doubling up against Olise.



In the one-v-one, Olise wrong-foots Nuno Mendes and dribbles inside the pitch…



… but his shot is saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma.



Despite Bayern's control in the second half, PSG managed to take the lead through Doue in a transitional moment after Neves won the ball back in midfield.

Later in the game, Ousmane Dembele scored on another transition to make it 2-0 and seal PSG's place in the semi-finals of the Club World Cup.

PSG's goals reflected another part of the game that made it more exciting. Both teams were willing to press high up the pitch, counter-press when they lost possession and hit on the counter whenever there was an opportunity — all of this suited the match's most skilful players.

We are edging towards the conclusion of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, with just four sides remaining in the revamped 32-team tournament. 

The quarterfinals produced a staggering amount of drama, especially on the right side of the draw as Paris Saint-Germain faced Bayern Munich and Real Madrid dueled Borussia Dortmund in repeats of recent UEFA Champions League finals. It was the French and Spanish giants who triumphed over their German opponents. 

They have earned their place in the semifinal, as have Chelsea after their victory over Palmeiras. The Blues are on the easier side of the draw and will have to overcome Brazilian adversaries again in the last four as they prepare for a mighty battle with Fluminense. 

Here's a look at the FIFA Club World Cup bracket ahead of the semifinals.

Real Madrid's Trent Alexander-Arnold speaking to Dazn about his former Liverpool team-mate Diogo Jota, who died aged 28 in a car crash on Thursday: ""He was a great friend of mine. It's been extremely difficult for me personally and also to everyone who knew him - not just his team-mates, friends or family, but everyone in the world of football. It's been very emotional and heart-warming to see the footballing world united and come together to show their love and support for him and his family and his brother as well.

""Although it's been difficult, it's also been a nice gesture from everyone. People united and showing love and support for what must be a mind-blowingly hard time for his family. I've been around him, his brother, his family, his amazing wife, his amazing parents and his amazing children. It's truly, truly heart-breaking to wake up to news like that. It's something you never expect.

""He was a very close friend, someone who lit up the room when he was in it. I shared the dressing room with him for five years. Amazing memories on and off the pitch. It goes without saying he will never be forgotten by anyone. He will live long in all our memories for the amazing man and the player he was.""

Nizaar KinsellaBBC Sport football news reporter at MetLife Stadium

Real Madrid survived a dramatic added-time period, which featured three goals and a red card, to hold off Borussia Dortmund and qualify for the semi-final of the Club World Cup.

Gonzalo Garcia added his fourth goal in five matches after volleying in Arda Guler's pass in the 10th minute and Fran Garcia made it 2-0, tapping in Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross 10 minutes later.

Madrid were coasting to victory but substitute Maximilian Beier hit the first for Dortmund, sparking a frantic end to the game.

Substitute Kylian Mbappe scored an acrobatic volley shortly afterwards but defender Dean Huijsen was sent off for giving away a penalty just seconds later, after pulling back striker Serhou Guirassy, who then converted from the spot.

It was too late to change the outcome and the competition's breakout attacker Garcia put himself in pole position to win the Golden Boot at the Club World Cup.

He is level on four goals with Benfica's Angel di Maria and Al-Hilal's Marcos Leonardo, who have both now been eliminated from the competition.

Madrid next face Paris St-Germain at the same stadium on Wednesday (20:00 BST).

Borussia Dortmund

Borussia Dortmund head coach Niko Kovac speaking to DAZN: ""Football sometimes is strange. In the first half, we didn't play well. We were passive. We were just waiting and not being aggressive enough. The second half was better from us but the save in the final minute was incredible. [Thibaut] Courtois is a world-class goalkeeper. 

""Real Madrid were so quick in attack. If you are too deep and you are too deep and you are too passive, this is not the best thing. We lost the game in the first half, not the second."" 

On their Club World Cup campaign: ""Overall, we achieved more than we expected. We played the quarter-final against Real Madrid and it's not a problem to lose against them. They are a world-class team. Now we go for the holidays - two or three weeks and then we start our engines again to prepare for the Bundesliga.""

Andros TownsendFormer Tottenham midfielder on Dazn

I love Gonzalo Garcia's finish where he opens up his foot to put it in the
far post as opposed to putting it back to the near post. 

As he opens his foot,
he takes it away from the goalkeeper. It really is an expert finish. 

The fact
that at the last minute he has opened up his foot, he gave the keeper no chance.

Callum WilsonNewcastle striker speaking on Dazn

We aren't talking about him [Gonzalo Garcia] stepping in for one game and
turning up. He has done it game after game throughout the tournament. He is
nearly the top scorer in the tournament. 

It's not just goals he is bringing, he
is bringing work-rate, and he is helping them press. He deserves the respect
now.

Obviously Kylian Mbappe is a superstar but also, they may have a star in
the making. He just has to make sure he keeps getting opportunities and when he
does, he has to take them like he has.

nothing went through.

“Overall, a good 80 minutes and the last 10 minutes we need

On Gonzalo Garcia: “He's doing great work for the team. He's
in the right positions in the box. He's a proper number nine and I'm pleased he's doing
that well.”

for us, but let's take the positives from today.”

Rob GreenFormer England goalkeeper on Dazn

He has won the game for Real Madrid from nothing, Thibaut Courtois. He has barely touched the ball today. 

Niko Kovac can't believe it. Borussia Dortmund can't believe it. They were dead and buried minutes ago. But what a finale we have had here. 

Real Madrid 3-2 Borussia Dortmund

It is Paris St-Germain versus Real Madrid in a mouth-watering semi-final.

Real had looked in complete control at 2-0 up with goals from Gonzalo Garcia and Fran Garcia.

Maximilian Beier made it 2-1 in the second minute of injury-time, only for Kylian Mbappe to acrobatically volley in a third for Real.

But, in a frantic few moments, Dean Huijsen was sent off for Real when conceding a penalty, which Serhou Guirassy converted.

Dortmund almost snatched an equaliser in the 10th minute of added time through Marcel Sabitzer's shot on the turn, but Thibaut Courtois denied them.

Out of nowhere, Borussia Dortmund almost force extra-time. A shot on the turn comes in from Marcel Sabitzer and Thibaut Courtois gets his hand to it to stop it nestling in the bottom corner.

Real Madrid were cruising to a comfortable victory. But we have had everything in this injury time. 

Serhou Guirassy barely had a kick in the game but I am not sure how much time Dortmund will have to get back in it.

Dean Huijsen, who moved from Bournemouth last month, is deemed the last man and deemed to have not tried to play the ball. He walks and would miss a potential semi-final against Paris St-Germain.

Rob GreenFormer England goalkeeper on Dazn

Kylian Mbappe steals the show. He is one of the stars of this Real Madrid team in this tournament. 

It's a spectacular one from Mbappe. He had to wait just long enough and he knew exactly how to finish it. 

Dortmund asked a question and Real Madrid very quickly and firmly came with an answer. 

Garcia has been Real Madrid's breakout star at the Club World Cup having only played six games for the club before the competition

Real Madrid survived a dramatic period of injury time featuring three goals and a red card to beat Borussia Dortmund and reach the Club World Cup semi-finals.

The Spanish side looked to be heading towards a comfortable victory as they led 2-0 as the match reached 90 minutes.

Gonzalo Garcia had volleyed home his fourth goal in five matches on 10 minutes before Fran Garcia tapped in Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross 10 minutes later.

But substitute Maximilian Beier pulled a goal back in the second minute of injury time to spark an incredible end to the match.

Substitute Kylian Mbappe scored an acrobatic volley to re-establish Real's two-goal lead, but defender Dean Huijsen was then sent off for pulling down striker Serhou Guirassy, who converted from the penalty spot.

The late drama did not change the outcome, with Real reaching the semi-finals, where they will face Paris St-Germain on Wednesday.

Gonzalo Garcia will go into that game tied at the top of the golden boot standings with Angel di Maria and Marcos Leonardo - both of whom have been eliminated.

Garcia had only played six times for Real before this competition and scored just once.

But he has taken his chance in front of new manager Xabi Alonso, and started ahead of superstar Mbappe here.

Of course, Alonso may well have been rotating his team but Garcia has been involved in every match in the United States and is making his case to stay in the squad next season.

Garcia certainly stood out with his industry up front, chasing lost causes, linking well and taking his chances.

New signing Huijsen was assured at the back until his sending-off while Thibaut Courtois sensationally saved Marcel Sabitzer's volley, which was the last kick of the match.

Dortmund were largely outclassed but Julian Brandt was a threat both in terms of almost scoring himself and in trying to create for others.

Madrid qualify for the Club World Cup semi-final and will face Paris St-Germain at MetLife Stadium on Wednesday (20:00 BST). 

Dortmund restart their domestic football in mid-August with a game against Essen.

...

Rúben Neves and João Cancelo flew to Portugal following Al Hilal's 2-1 defeat to Fluminense in the Club World Cup quarterfinals for the funeral of former teammate Diogo Jota. Neves served as a pallbearer for his close friend who died in a car crash with his brother André Silva in Spain on Thursday.

Jota was 28 years old, Silva was 26.

Prior to the match with Fluminense, Neves posted a tribute to Jota on social media.

""Wherever you are, I know you're going to read this, we've never been one for this sort of thing and maybe now I'll regret it a little,"" Neves wrote on an Instagram post. ""But you know what you mean to me just as much as I know what I am to you.""

""When I go to the national team, you'll still be by my side at the dinner table, on the bus, on the plane... you'll always be there with me, as usual,"" he continued. ""We'll keep laughing, making plans, sharing our lives with each other. I'll make sure you're always there and I'll make sure your family never lacks anything while you're there, far away but thinking of us, waiting for us...""

During a moment of silence before the Club World Cup match began, Neves and Cancelo broke down with emotion for their former teammate.

Players and staff from Liverpool, for whom Jota played in the Premier League, also traveled to Portugal for the funeral. Among those in attendance were captain Virgil van Dijk and manager Arne Slot.

Jota originally joined Liverpool in 2020, scoring 47 goals with 15 assists in his 79 starts with the team, which won the Premier League title for the 2024-25 season.

Jota's death inspired tributes throughout the world on Friday. During Chelsea's Club World Cup match with Palmeiras, Jota's Portugal teammate Pedro Neto brought a jersey with the names Diogo and André onto the pitch.

Portuguese tennis players Nuno Borges and Francisco Cabral wore black ribbons during their matches at Wimbledon on Friday, as the All-England Club relaxed its all-white dress code to allow the players to pay tribute.

At the first show of their reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales, the rock band Oasis had an image of Jota in his Liverpool jersey projected behind the stage.

The cause of the crash that killed Jota and Silva is still ongoing. Police do not know who was driving the car and whether or not a blown tire caused the crash. The vehicle, a Lamborghini, was in flames when firefighters arrived on the scene.

The Spanish Civil Guard later confirmed to the Associated Press that Jota and Silva were killed in the crash, and their bodies were returned to Portugal for the funeral.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

How much can be taken from the hot streak that Gonzalo Garcia is on in the Club World Cup for Real Madrid. (1:47)

Real Madrid forward Gonzalo García said he is a living a ""dream"" at the FIFA Club World Cup after earning comparisons to the club's legendary former striker, Raúl, with four goals in five games for Los Blancos.

Gonzalo, 21, is tied with Al Hilal's Marcos Leonardo and Benfica winger Ángel Di María in the race for the Club World Cup Golden Boot after his first-half goal in Saturday's 3-2 quarterfinal win against Borussia Dortmund set up a semifinal clash against Paris Saint-Germain.

Madrid have struggled to develop a homegrown goalscorer since Raúl emerged in the 1990s before scoring 323 goals in 741 games -- a club record until his tally was surpassed by Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema.

Gonzalo a prolific scorer with Madrid's B team Castilla, said he is now determined to justify the Raúl comparisons with more goals for Xabi Alonso's team.

""They [fans] are comparing me with Raúl, a legend,"" Gonzalo told reporters. ""If I can do half of what he did in this shirt then it will be more than a dream.

""I have been working, waiting for a chance, but not in my dreams would I have thought of this.

""I don't feel a lot of pressure. I have been working and waiting for this moment.

""The coach, the players, the staff all give me a lot of confidence. Kylian [Mbappé] is... almost ... let's say the best player in the world. I feel so lucky to share a pitch and training with him, to learn from him.""

Madrid face PSG in Wednesday's semifinal in New Jersey having been replaced as European champions by the Champions League winners.

Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said the team must be better prepared to face the French team after conceding two late goals in the quarterfinal win against Dortmund.

""We have to analyse our game and then we will work for the next game,"" he said. ""PSG are a great opponent, current Champions League winners and they had a great season.

""It will be a hard game, they like possession and they press well, so we will have to be prepared.

""The team is doing well. We press well, defend well, attack well. Sometimes we need more possession to kill the game. That is what we have to do better.

""We are getting better every game, learning more from the coach, putting what he wants in the game. It doesn't always happen, but we are getting better.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Bayern Munich's 22-year-old young superstar Jamal Musiala suffered a horrific leg injury at the end of the first half of the team's 2-0 Club World Cup quarterfinal loss to PSG Saturday in Atlanta. The Germany international, one of the most technical and prolific midfielders in the sport, went after a loose ball in the attacking box just as PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma committed to playing it. The Italian goalkeeper dove for the ball and landed on Musiala's left leg. When the play cleared up, his left ankle could be clearly seen dangling to the side. 

Bayern players quickly alerted the goalkeeper to stop playing so that the player could be tended to. Numerous teammates surrounded him and put their hands over their heads in disbelief at the severity of the injury. The referee quickly signaled for the medical team to bring a stretcher out on the field as the teams went into the tunnel for halftime and Musiala received medical treatment.

Musiala was taken to the hospital.

""For me, this isn't a result of constant playing,"" Bayern sporting director Max Eberl said after the game, according to ESPN. ""It is more of an accident, it happened, and this is obviously bad for us.""

""It didn't look good,"" Bayern head coach Vincent Kompany said. ""If I'm just watching the images, it looked like an ankle injury of some kind, but I'm not going to make a diagnosis here.""

On Monday Bayern confirmed that their attacker had broken his fibula.

Jamal Musiala suffered a fibula fracture and an ankle dislocation and will be sidelined for a long period of time. 💔We are with you every step of the way, Jamal! 🙏 pic.twitter.com/851vHUBeqv

PSG managed to get the winning goal in the 78th minute via a low shot from Desire Doue, yet it was far from smooth sailing the rest of the way. PSG got two red cards, with Willian Pacho (bad tackle) and Lucas Hernandez (elbow to face) both being booted from the match. Despite the two-man advantage, Bayern could not find the equalizer as Ousmane Dembele put home PSG's second in the sixth minute of added time. 

With the win, PSG will face Real Madrid in the semifinals next week. 

Musiala was the Germany national team player of the year last year. He debuted for Bayen at age 17 and became the first teenage to play for Germany at the World Cup since 1958. He's widely expected to become one of the world's very best players in the coming years.

Mauricio Pochettino has lost five of his 15 games in charge of the US

Mauricio Pochettino's start to life as head coach of the United States men's national team has not been as convincing as he and the fans would have liked, but a promising run in this summer's Gold Cup might have begun to turn things around.

A win against Mexico in Sunday's final would deliver a trophy and start the process of instilling some much-needed belief.

It's a victory that Pochettino and his players need if they are to demonstrate that things are moving in the right direction before a World Cup on home soil next summer.

By now, the US should have some clarity in their preparations for the 2026 tournament, but there remains an unfinished, rocky feel to the foundations they have been laying since Pochettino took over in September 2024.

Questions were being asked of the former Tottenham Hotspur and Paris St-Germain boss following consecutive defeats by Panama and Canada in the Nations League finals, and Turkey and Switzerland in Gold Cup warm-up games.

Though they were only friendlies, those last two losses had USMNT (United States Men's National Team) fans worried.

These games, more so than those against regional opponents, are seen as the type of test they will face in the World Cup - and they failed both.

With the big tournament less than a year away and only one more competitive game to play, it can be easy to slip into a last-minute panic.

There has been a lack of consistency in both personnel and results. The squad appears unresolved, with the group of players called up differing for each camp, something that has mostly been beyond Pochettino's control.

Fifty-five players have made appearances for the USA under the Argentine since he was appointed 10 months ago, making it difficult to build momentum and togetherness.

Mixed results across those 15 matches have reflected this inconsistency and during this time, they are yet to claim victory against a team in the top 30 of Fifa's rankings.

Goalkeeper Matt Freese and forward Malik Tillman have impressed during the United States' run to the final

The Gold Cup is Concacaf's Euros and Copa America equivalent. Sunday's final against Mexico is the United States' last competitive match before the World Cup, which explains the sense of urgency going into it.

Pochettino's side have experienced a promising campaign despite missing some key players. Their presence in the final reflects that progress.

It has been a bonding experience for the players involved, but it's likely the XI that starts their first World Cup game in Inglewood next June will look significantly different.

Due to a combination of injury, the Club World Cup and fatigue, this current squad is without familiar names such as Fulham's Antonee Robinson, Juventus pair Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah, AC Milan duo Yunus Musah and Christian Pulisic and Monaco striker Folarin Balogun.

Star man Pulisic's decision to rest this summer rather than take part in the Gold Cup was particularly controversial given the context of building for next year's home World Cup.

The players Pochettino has been able to call upon have developed into a useful unit as the tournament has progressed and it's the most together and determined a US group has looked since he took over.

He might wish this togetherness could have been created with his first-choice group but, on the other hand, it has given him a good chance to test fringe players in a competitive, high-pressure environment with a trophy on the line.

Some of this contingent have made a good case for inclusion in next summer's 26-man squad.

Diego Luna has long been touted as a player with the potential to offer the United States something they've been missing. The 21-year-old energetic playmaker, who plays his club football for Real Salt Lake in MLS, has come into his own in the Gold Cup as one of this team's star players.

In goal, Matt Freese, of Manchester City's US relative New York City, has been given the nod ahead of Nottingham Forest's Matt Turner all tournament and, bar one mistake against Haiti, has pushed for inclusion at the World Cup.

Freese's penalty shootout heroics in the quarter-final against Costa Rica gave him a tournament highlight, doing his chances of a 2026 call-up no harm at all.

Elsewhere, midfielder Jack McGlynn, who was also eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland, has showcased his talent on the international stage, Bayer Leverkusen-linked Malik Tillman has impressed in a role just off the striker, and Crystal Palace defender Chris Richards has strengthened his claim for a starting centre-back role.

Regardless of what happens against Mexico, this Gold Cup has been a useful experience and a productive exercise - but there's an argument it needed to be more.

Sooner rather than later, Pochettino needs to turn this work in progress into a fully prepared first-choice team.

If the Club World Cup is a World Cup warm-up for the US in an organisational sense, the Gold Cup is a warm-up for what they will look like as a host nation in terms of how its team plays and how it is supported.

Research from renowned US outlet Soccer America revealed that group-stage attendances have dropped compared to recent editions but, though disappointing, this isn't necessarily a sign of things to come at the World Cup.

The clash with the Club World Cup, the absence of familiar stars and ticket pricing issues across the game will have affected turnout but the semi-final in St Louis against Guatemala was sold out.

Guatemala had plenty of support too and at times it felt like it was their home game. Pochettino, 53, believes they can serve as an example for US fans.

""[That] connection between the fans and the team, that is the connection that we'd like to see in the World Cup,"" he said. ""That connection that makes you fly.""

The United States doing well and encouraging sports fans to connect with its men's team during 2026 feels more important for US soccer than merely hosting the World Cup.

The Gold Cup has been something of a tonic for Pochettino and the USMNT but the Mexico game is a similar test to those they failed to pass against Turkey and Switzerland.

This moment cares not for the profile of the competition nor the strength of the squad available to Pochettino. It cares about lifting the trophy.

Win, and they'll have met expectations in an impressively resolute fashion while missing some familiar stars. Lose, and the pre-World Cup panic will return.

As the U.S. national team prepares to vie for a Gold Cup championship without him and several other regulars Sunday night against Mexico, polarizing young American and local product Gio Reyna did not get off the bench again in his supposed homecoming on Saturday. 

The 22-year-old Reyna did not play at all in his Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund's 3-2 knockout loss to La Liga powerhouse Real Madrid in the quarterfinals of the FIFA Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium. 

The talented midfielder logged only 12 minutes in Dortmund's five matches on U.S. soil this summer, and his limited usage could lead to a transfer in the coming months to benefit his development — especially with a crucial World Cup on the horizon in 2026 for the USMNT in North America after the hiring of head coach Mauricio Pochettino last September. 

Reyna's attitude issues and lack of playing time were controversial storylines at the previous World Cup in Qatar in 2022 under since-fired coach Gregg Berhalter, who publicly clashed with the young player's parents, including former national team captain Claudio Reyna. 

With Gio Reyna, Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and others not rostered during this CONCACAF window, the U.S. squad has relied upon and received intriguing production from several emerging players during its Gold Cup run. 

Diego Luna, Malik Tillman and Patrick Agyemang are among those building cases to play themselves into creative roles a year from now. 

Including Saturday's match, Reyna only saw action in Club World Cup play against South Korean club Ulsan Hyundai in the group round. 

Interestingly, Dortmund had used Reyna as part of its marketing campaign for its time in the U.S. 

There had been some thinking that Reyna might get on the pitch Saturday with Jobe Bellingham — whose brother Jude plays for Real Madrid — suspended for the quarters due to yellow-card accumulation. 

But Dortmund manager Niko Kovac did not use Reyna for the fourth time in five games, casting further doubt about his future with the German power. It would make sense for him to seek a transfer if he's not in the plans. 

Earlier this year, Reyna said in an interview with the FIFA website that he was “excited” about the possibility of playing near where he grew up. 

No matter where you are in the world, you can watch the FIFA Club World Cup for free on DAZN. All you need to get started is an email address. No subscription is required, but you will have to make a free account on the streamer to start watching.

DAZN also has premium, paid options available to enhance your viewing experience with HDR picture, Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound, and fewer ads. DAZN Premium plans begin at $19.99/month. 

“It's one of those stadiums that I've watched [games in] so much growing up that it's maybe going to be a little bit strange to actually be on the pitch there,” Reyna said of MetLife Stadium. “I'm very excited for me and, of course, all my family and friends in the area. 

“I'm going to have to get a lot of [tickets]. It should be fun and I'm really looking forward to it.” 

Kovac made three substitutions at the start of the second half, and another later on, but Reyna was not among them. 

“Gio is a player of Dortmund [for] four or five years,” Kovac said earlier in the tournament. “He is a part of my team at the moment. Gio is for sure a player who didn't play so much, but we know exactly his strengths, but we have top players here in the squad. 

“The confidence is very big, so hopefully every player can get minutes, but I can't promise you this is depending also on the results, also injuries, but my ambition is to give every player minutes. But this is always in relation to the results.”

An epic all-European clash and an upstart Brazilian side takes on London's finest in the final four.

Three European teams and one from South America have their sights set on the FIFA Club World Cup (CWC) 2025 trophy as the tournament enters the semifinal stage on Tuesday.

The final two clubs qualified for the final four on Saturday. UEFA Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) spectacularly defeated Bayern Munich 2-0 in the quarterfinals despite being reduced to nine men. Five-time CWC winners Real Madrid played out a five-goal thriller to beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2 to seal their semifinal spot.

Here's how the Club World Cup semifinals line up:

When: Tuesday at 3pm (19:00 GMT)
Where: MetLife Stadium, New Jersey

The opening semifinal pitches Brazil's Fluminense against English Premier League side Chelsea.

Fluminense continue to impress at the CWC with goals from Matheus Martinelli and Hercules securing their place in the last four with a 2-1 win against Al Hilal in Orlando, Florida.

Chelsea scored the go-ahead goal on Malo Gusto's 83rd-minute shot, which went in after a pair of deflections, beating Palmeiras 2-1 on Friday night to secure their spot in the semifinals.

Cole Palmer put Chelsea ahead in the 16th minute, but Estevao, an 18-year-old who will transfer to Chelsea after the CWC, tied the score against his future club in the 53rd. Gusto's match-winning shot after a short corner kick that appeared to deflect off defender Agustin Giay and goalkeeper Weverton sent the Chelsea fans among the 65,782 spectators into a frenzy.

The match will take place at the 88,000-seat MetLife Stadium just outside New York City.

When: Wednesday at 3pm (19:00 GMT)
Where: MetLife Stadium, New Jersey

The second semifinal features a mouthwatering European heavyweight matchup between PSG and Real Madrid.

Nine-man Paris Saint-Germain advanced after defeating Bayern Munich 2-0 with goals from Desire Doue and Ousmane Dembele keeping the French side on track to achieve a historic quadruple of major titles in one season.

Luis Enrique's side needed to dig deep in front of 67,000 fans at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, after late red cards for Willian Pacho and Lucas Hernandez.

Meanwhile, Gonzalo Garcia scored his fourth goal of the Club World Cup and Kylian Mbappe his first as Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2 in the final quarterfinal on Saturday.

Garcia put Madrid ahead from close range early on during a hot afternoon at the MetLife Stadium, and Fran Garcia then doubled their lead before the midway point.

Dortmund never seriously threatened a comeback before a remarkable late flurry of activity with Maximilian Beier pulling one back in the 93rd minute and superstar forward Mbappe registering Madrid's third goal with a stunning overhead kick.

Mbappe, who has battled illness for most of the CWC, will face his previous club PSG for the first time since he departed the Paris-based side for Real Madrid in June 2024.

The final will be played on Sunday at the MetLife Stadium, which will also the venue for the 2026 FIFA World Cup final.

The winning team in the Club World Cup could pocket as much as $125m in prize money.

The Argentine added another memorable goal to his growing MLS highlight reel, scoring an extraordinary solo effort to put his side 4-1 up

Lionel Messi produced a moment of individual brilliance in the 61st minute of Inter Miami's clash with CF Montreal. Receiving the ball just after the halfway line, Messi embarked on a weaving run that saw him evade four Montreal defenders before calmly slotting the ball past the goalkeeper into the net. The goal, which put Miami up 4-1, showcased Messi's trademark close control, acceleration, and clinical finishing.

Messi has now scored 12 goals and seven assists in fourteen MLS appearances this season, leading Miami's attack while forming a devastating partnership with Luis Suárez (five goals and eight assists). His consistent brilliance has made the Herons into legitimate MLS Cup favorites.

Following their 4-1 victory over CF Montreal, Inter Miami will go on the road once again to face the New England Revolution on July 9. They'll then return to Chase Stadium to host Nashville SC on July 12, which they'll follow up with a road trip to face FC Cincinnati on July 16.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Cristiano Ronaldo's sister, Katia Aveiro, has explained why the Portugal captain did not attend Diogo Jota's funeral.

Liverpool forward Jota was laid to rest on Saturday having tragically lost his life in a car accident alongside brother Andre Silva on July 3. The service, which took place near Jota's home town of Porto, was attended by several of the 28-year-old's team-mates and coaches.

Ronaldo, who is now playing his club football in Saudi Arabia for Al-Nassr, was not among those to make the journey back to his homeland. The 40-year-old has faced criticism from some for not making that trip, but said decision was taken as a mark of respect - with Ronaldo concerned that his presence would overshadow proceedings.

Katia wrote in an emotional Instagram story: “When my father died. In addition to the pain of loss we had to deal with a flood of cameras and curious onlookers at the cemetery and everywhere we went. And attention was not what it is today in terms of access... At no time were we (the children) able to leave the chapel; it was only possible at the time of the burial, such was the commotion.

“At the funeral, there were presidents, coaches of the national team at the time, such as Luís Filipe Scolari, etc. I don't remember seeing any of them. And they certainly greeted me. The pain blinded me.

“About pain/family and real support... You will never know what it means until you go through it. If someone sends me a message criticising anything my brother does, I will block it (completely ignore it), that is, they will only do it once.

“It's getting tiring. The fanaticism. The criticism for nothing, I repeat nothing... Sick society... We all have families. It is absurdly shameful to watch TV channels/commentators/social networks emphasising an absence rather than respectfully honouring the pain of a mutilated family destroyed by the loss of two brothers. I am even ashamed to watch. Regrettable.

“And so the world goes... Society and opinion. Today they are worthless. They themselves have become bottomless pits. I feel sorry... And war is also like that. Believe me. Human evil is also a war. And every day we have to fight against it. And so it goes.”

Ronaldo was among those to pay tribute to Jota on social media following confirmation of his passing, writing: “It doesn't make sense. We were just together in the national team, and you had just gotten married. To your family, your wife and your children, I send my condolences and wish them all the strength in the world. I know you will always be with them. Rest in peace, Diogo and Andre. We will all miss you.”

Ronaldo and Jota formed part of the Portugal squad that savoured UEFA Nations League glory on June 8. Jota married childhood sweetheart Rute Cardoso on June 22. Messages of condolence have flooded in from around the world.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Wrexham have reportedly agreed a £5 million ($7m) deal with Nottingham Forest for Lewis O'Brien, but a record-breaking transfer may not happen.

The Red Dragons are looking to add Premier League experience to their ranks in the summer window. Several players that have graced the English top-flight are seeing moves to North Wales speculated on.

Hollywood co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney are helping to make the funds available that allow marquee additions to Phil Parkinson's squad to be sought. O'Brien, who joined Forest following their return to the big time in 2022, is a player in Wrexham's sights.

The former Huddersfield midfielder has impressed at Championship level again when taking in loan spells at Middlesbrough and Swansea. Forest are prepared to let the 26-year-old leave after seeing their asking price met.

The Sun, however, are reporting that Wrexham are “struggling to meet his salary demands” and that a “transfer to Wales is now in doubt”. A compromise will need to be reached during wage discussions in order for a deal to go through.

Wrexham, who have enjoyed a historic run of three successive promotions, have already drafted in Ryan Hardie and Danny Ward this summer. More movement is expected before the 2025-26 campaign gets underway.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly called on Al-Nassr to challenge Arsenal in a summer transfer raid on Real Madrid for Rodrygo.

The Gunners are generating plenty of speculation when it comes to Brazil international wingers. Gabriel Martinelli is seeing a big-money move away from Emirates Stadium speculated on - with Al-Nassr said to have an €85 million (£73m/$100m) bid on the table.

The Gunners are willing to do business there as they need to raise the funds that will allow a formal approach for Samba star Rodrygo to be made. Real Madrid are said to have placed a £70m ($96m) price tag around the South American's neck.

According to Sky Sports, Ronaldo has urged Al-Nassr to shelve interest in Martinelli and join the fight for Rodrygo. He considers the 24-year-old forward to be a better option for the Saudi Pro League outfit.

Portuguese GOAT Ronaldo has signed a new two-year contract with Al-Nassr on record-breaking terms. He wants to see new boss Jorge Jesus bring in players that can help him to win elusive major silverware in the Middle East.

Rodrygo appears likely to leave Madrid during the summer transfer window, having struggled for minutes under Xabi Alonso at the FIFA Club World Cup, but questions are being asked of whether he - like Martinelli - would want to leave Europe for Saudi Arabia at this stage of his career.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

At 18 years of age, England U21 international Nwaneri is considered to be one of the hottest prospects in world football. He recently helped the Young Lions to European Championship glory and took in 37 appearances for the Gunners last season - scoring nine goals.

Arsenal are understandably keen to put a new deal in place with another product of their famed academy system. Nwaneri has entered the final 12 months of his current contract at Emirates Stadium.

The Premier League's youngest debutant, who made his top-flight bow in September 2022 at 15 years of age, is attracting interest from leading clubs across Europe. Chelsea are said to be keeping a close eye on his situation at London rivals.


The Blues are being given hope of potentially pulling off a stunning coup as, according to talkSPORT, Nwaneri is “reluctant to sign a new deal at Arsenal without guaranteed playing time” - with his ongoing development requiring regular outings.

The youngster is currently competing with the likes of Bukayo Saka, Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli for minutes on the flanks, while Arsenal are being linked with a raid on Chelsea for England international Noni Madueke.

Nwaneri has revealed that challenging for the Ballon d'Or forms part of his future plans, and a starting berth will have to be nailed down somewhere if he is to land a Golden Ball. Arsenal need to convince a home-grown star that he can fulfil his ambition on their books.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Bayern Munich suffer huge setback after horror injury at FIFA Club World Cup","https://www.goal.com/en-in/news/how-long-jamal-musiala-out-ankle-break-bayern-munich-setback-injury-fifa-club-world-cup/blt64eb2375cfbc38ac","Sun, 06 Jul 2025 07:26:05 GMT","

Bayern Munich star Jamal Musiala is facing up to several months on the sidelines after breaking his ankle at the FIFA Club World Cup.

The Germany international is reported to have suffered a broken left fibula, with a horror injury being picked up when facing Paris Saint-Germain in the quarter-finals of a global tournament in the United States.

Said contest saw Musiala - who is inheriting the No.10 shirt at Bayern from departing team-mate Leroy Sane - make his first start since April, having recovered from a muscular complaint, but he is back on the treatment table after being taken to hospital in Atlanta.

The 22-year-old competed for a loose ball with PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma late in the first half of a clash at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. His ankle got caught under the Italian goalkeeper, leaving him writhing in agony and requiring immediate medical assistance.

German news outlet BILD claims that Musiala has “damaged several ligaments” and “will likely be out for four to five months”. Bayern's sporting director, Christoph Freund, delivered an “unfortunately it doesn't look good” assessment when asked by DAZN for an update.

Bayern boss Vincent Kompany said his “blood boils” after seeing an integral part of his plans ruled out once again, but did add: “The overwhelming feeling is that I hope it's not as bad as it looks, and that he will get through this one.” Bundesliga champions Bayern suffered a 2-0 defeat to PSG and are now preparing to head home for a short break ahead of the 2025-26 campaign.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Taylor Fritz advanced to the Wimbledon quarter-finals for the third time on Sunday when Australian Jordan Thompson was forced to retire due to injury. The fifth-seeded American led Tompson 6-1, 3-0 when the 31-year-old ended play on No. 1 Court due to back pain.

Fritz arrived in London off the back of a record fourth Eastbourne title last week and was pushed to his limits in his opening two matches at SW19. The No. 5 player in the PIF ATP Rankings rallied from the brink to defeat Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in five sets in the first round and then went the distance against Gabriel Diallo in round two. He downed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in four sets in the third round.

Having spent nine hours and 43 minutes on court through his first three matches, Fritz was on the grass for just 40 minutes against Thompson, who had heavy strapping on his right leg and struggled with a back issue in the pair's third Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

""It is not the way I want to go through,"" Fritz said. ""I was really excited to play Jordan today. I was excited to play some good tennis and it is just sad. He has been battling. He has been playing five setters. He was out playing a long doubles match yesterday, so he has been battling out here and respect to him for coming out. His body is not right, so I feel bad for him and hope he feels better.""

Fritz is through to the quarter-finals of Wimbledon with a 6-1 3-0 lead, as Thompson is forced to retire in the second set… @wimbledon | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/xbq3hdUKld

Fritz is 12th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and will hope to lift himself into the Top 10 with victory in the quarter-finals against Karen Khachanov. Fritz will hope to return to Italy for the prestigious year-end event in 2025, having advanced to the title match at the Nitto ATP Finals last season (l. to Jannik Sinner).

Thompson won five setters in his first two matches and defeated Luciano Darderi in four sets in the third round. Earlier this week the Australian opened up on playing through the pain of injury. The World No. 44 was competing in the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time.



Fritz's next opponent, Khachanov, ended the run of Pole Kamil Majchrzak with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 triumph on No. 2 Court. Khachanov, a quarter-finalist at SW19 in 2021, rallied from 2-5 down against Nuno Borges in the fifth set to advance to the fourth round and backed that up with a comfortable win against Majchrzak.

The seven-time tour-level titlist struck 44 winners to 21 unforced errors and broke Majchrzak's serve six times to advance after one hour and 48 minutes. Khachanov is now 8-2 on grass this year, having reached the semi-finals at the ATP 500 event in Halle.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","'Pain-free' Dimitrov ready for Sinner clash following retirement nightmare","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/dimitrov-wimbledon-2025-feature-sunday","Sun, 06 Jul 2025 15:09:20 GMT","

“We're in the second week of Wimbledon. Let's have fun.”

Grigor Dimitrov delivered the words with a smile and a shrug, the kind of casual confidence that only comes after weathering storms. It was Saturday afternoon at the All England Club and the 34-year-old was speaking to a small circle of reporters, relaxed, reflective and very much still in the tournament.

Just an hour earlier, the 34-year-old had sealed his place in the second week at Wimbledon with a commanding straight-sets win against Sebastian Ofner, finishing the job with an ace on No. 3 Court. For the third year in a row, he's among the last 16 at the grass-court major, but this time, the moment carries a different weight. This run feels earned in a way that goes beyond forehands and footwork.

The past twelve months have tested Dimitrov to the limit. Last year, his Wimbledon campaign ended abruptly with a retirement against Daniil Medvedev in the fourth round. At the US Open, he surged into the quarter-finals, only to be halted mid-match by injury once again, this time against Frances Tiafoe.
The trend continued into 2025, with first-round retirements at both the Australian Open and Roland Garros, marking a grim milestone: four consecutive Grand Slam retirements.
“I think that's why you have everybody around you, all your team, to keep you honest with whatever is going on with your body,” Dimitrov said when asked on how he has coped with his recent struggles. “The amount of scans and MRIs and X-rays, whatever that I've done throughout this amount of time, it confirms where you're at, but ultimately you're the one that gets to that point of thinking or not thinking.
“Some days it's inevitable [that you think about the injury issues] just because you wake up and you feel something. But this is also a place where I'm entering in my career that I have to accept the fact that there's going to be something every single day. So I live with it, and I'm okay with it. As long as I've gone to work, match, tennis tournament, or whatever it is, and I've done 100 per cent of myself, then I've done my duty.”

Dimitrov touched down in London five weeks ago to train and importantly, recover. Fresh off a frustrating retirement at Roland Garros, the Bulgarian set up camp in the capital for rehab, trading court time for careful recovery. A leg injury, lingering for the better part of nine months, had demanded a new approach of fewer practice sessions, more rest and a strict focus on injury prevention.
So far, the strategy has paid off. Dimitrov has looked sharp and composed on the lawns of SW19, dropping just one set en route to the fourth round.
“At the moment I feel great. I'm pain-free,” Dimitrov said with optimism. “I've done quite a sufficient amount of work before the tournament began. Overall, every day has been positive. I feel like I'm building off that, which makes me not only happy but excited for what's to come.”
That excitement shows. After three matches, he's moving freely and striking the ball cleanly. A far cry from the physical uncertainty that's overshadowed much of his past year.
“All I want is to put myself in those type of positions,” Dimitrov added. “To get out there and play against these guys right now. This is in a way the most important thing for me.”

But the challenge gets steeper from here. On Monday, Dimitrov will face the ultimate test when he meets the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Jannik Sinner, who's been near untouchable so far. The Italian has dopped just 17 games in three rounds, tying the Open Era record for fewest games dropped en route to the fourth round at Wimbledon.
Sinner has spent the past 56 weeks atop the PIF ATP Rankings and has won two of the past three majors.
“He's been the best player in the world, especially over the course of the last year and a half, two [years],” Dimitrov said on Sinner. “You can appreciate his consistency, I would say, and the way he is able to execute without a single doubt in his game.”
The numbers favour Sinner, who leads former World No. 3 Dimitrov 4-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. But this will be their first meeting on grass, a surface where Dimitrov, a semi-finalist here in 2014, has always felt at home.

“The grass is very different right now. If you would have asked me a couple of years ago, maybe it was a bit faster and I would think yeah,” Dimitrov said. “At the moment, everybody is playing good on grass, and the grass evens out the game a little bit. I would say this year especially.
“I know what I want to do out there. It's more of the excitement of checking out my capabilities and the work that I've put in, the plays that I've tried, the hours that I spent on the court.”
In a tournament already full of upsets, Dimitrov will be aiming to deliver the most dramatic one yet when he walks onto Centre Court around 6 p.m. BST. But whatever happens, the former World No. 3 is clear-eyed about what matters most.
“I'm very positive at the stage where I'm at,” Dimitrov concluded. “Physically is probably the number one thing that I really need the most, and it's there right now. The rest is having fun.”

By Randy Walker

@TennisPublisher

There has been some hype beyond the happenings at Wimbledon about 59-year-old billionaire and tennis enthusiast Bill Ackman attempting to become the oldest player to earn an ATP ranking point at the Hall of Fame Open Challenger event in Newport, R.I.

The only problem is… he wouldn't be.

According to the ATP, the oldest player to have an ATP ranking was Gardnar Mulloy, whose ranking points in singles and doubles fell off the computer in February of 1978 when he was 64 years old. Mulloy “earned” his ranking point at a Grand Prix event played in North Miami, Florida played at tennis facility called the California Club, where Mulloy was the head teaching pro. In those days of the ATP computer, players earned a ranking point simply by playing in a Grand Prix event and one didn't have to win a match (now, you have to win a match to ear a ranking point) Mulloy only managed to win one game in the first round of singles falling to 23-year-old former NCAA singles champion John Whitlinger 6-0, 6-1

“If it would have been an exhibition match, I would have had a lot more fun with it,” Whitlinger said of the match to the Associated Press at the time. “But when I play tennis, I want to go out there and do the best job I can.”

In doubles at the event, Mulloy partnered with Paul Smith of Australia and lost in the first round to Armistead Neely and Alvaro Fillol 6-2, 6-4.

For those who don't know much of Mulloy, he is a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame who was the runner-up at the U.S. Championships (the modern-day U.S. Open) in 1952 (losing to Frank Sedgman) and who won four U.S. doubles titles and a Wimbledon doubles title in 1957. That title in 1957 made him the oldest player to win a Wimbledon men's doubles title at age 43. That same year, he became the oldest player to play Davis Cup for the United States. Mulloy played competitive tennis into his 90s and won over 100 USTA age group national championships. His last-ever interview on his career, especially his senior tennis career, is featured in the book “Sport of a Lifetime” for sale and download here: https://a.co/d/2G3kghG

Ackman will play doubles in Newport with former Wimbledon and U.S. Open doubles champion Jack Sock, who hasn't played a professional tennis match since losing in the first round of the 2023 U.S. Open, where he announced he was retiring from tennis to play professional pickleball.

Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital Management, said in media interviews that he is playing the best tennis of his life. However, he does not have a Universal Tennis Rating (UTR) and does not even have a profile, which would indicate he has not played any type of “sanctioned” organized tennis for a while. He does annually compete in an event called “The Finance Cup,” among top tennis-playing financers and he reportedly reached the semifinals at the recent event, also held in Newport, alongside former U.S. Open doubles champion Richey Reneberg. (Read of the 2025 Finance Cup in Newport here on Palmer.com here https://palmerpb.com/2025/07/04/wall-street-hits-the-grass-courts-of-newport/) Sock and Ackman only gained entry into the tournament when given a wild card entry from the tournament. Ackman admitted to Front Office Sports last week that he had yet to meet Sock in person.

Ackman wrote on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that Sock was offered the wild card by tournament officials and that he chose to play with him. Earlier this year, Ackman said that he and Nick Kyrgios had discussed playing in a lower-level Challenger or Futures level event together for fun. However, the opportunity has yet to materialize since Kyrgios has been injured.

If Ackman and Sock are able to win a match, Ackman would be the oldest CURRENT ATP-ranked player. The oldest current ATP doubles ranked player is 47-year-old Toshihide Matsui of Japan. The oldest ranked ATP singles player is 44-year-old Ryan Haviland, who re-entered the ATP singles rankings in May, as I discuss in my “TennisPublisher” podcast here: https://www.swellcast.com/t/O1UqB9NxBjx6VDB

Denmark's Lars Elvstrom, incidentally, is the second oldest player to earn an ATP ranking. He “achieved” the feat in doubles at the age of 59 and nine months and the $50,000 Challenger in New Delhi, India in 2008. Elvstrom partnered with the player he was coaching, fellow Dane Kristian Pless, and they advanced into the second round by walkover when Prakash Amritraj and Travis Rettenmaier pulled out of the doubles competition, which strangely only featured 12 teams that entered. Elvstrom, who reached a career-high ranked of No.280 in 1978, and Pless, the former world No. 65, lost in the quarterfinals to Illya Marchenko and Alexander Kudryavtsev 6-2, 6-1.

Ackman, age 59 and nearly two months (born May 11, 1966), would become the second oldest player to earn an ATP ranking if he is able to win a match in Newport as his point(s) would not drop off until after he turns 60.

The list of the oldest players to earn ATP DOUBLES rankings are as follows, as provided by the ATP Tour

The list of oldest players to earn ATP SINGLES rankings are as follows, as provided by the ATP Tour.

Wild card entries into tournaments are at the discretion of the tournament owners. Buying a wild card (providing anything of financial value in exchange for a wild card) is against rules of the International Tennis Integrity Agency and players, tournaments and promoters are subject to severe punishment in the form of fines and suspensions if found to buy a wild card or sell a wild card..

The International Tennis Hall of Fame is hosting a combined men's and women's Challenger level tournament for the first time in 2025, as you can read here https://worldtennismagazine.com/tennis-hall-of-fame-to-host-combined-mens-womens-challenger-starting-in-2025-to-continue-world-class-tennis-legacy/23536. The Challenger, a step-below the ATP and WTA Tours of pro tennis, marks the return of women's pro tennis to Newport since 1990. The event “replaces” the annual ATP Tour stop held in Newport since 1976.

Flavio Cobolli has marched through to the Wimbledon fourth round after dismissing Czechia's Jakub Mensik.

Despite a rain delay postponing the match, Cobolli's momentum was rarely halted on Saturday, with the Italian triumphing 6-1 7-6 6-3 against his opponent – who recently admitted he has barely played on grass.

The Italian, who is a future star on the ATP Tour, has spoken about his tennis influences and idols, including Novak Djokovic.

However, when speaking with the Tennis Channel after Monday's Wimbledon victory, the world number 24 revealed another idol of his.

Cobolli, who admitted he doesn't like to watch tennis, said his idol is ‘one of the most talented players ever.'

Speaking to the Tennis Channel on Monday, Cobolli named a surprise player as ‘one of the most talented players ever.'

The Italian, who has reached his first Grand Slam fourth round, noted the influence of Fabio Fognini on his tennis career.

Cobolli said: “I didn't like watching tennis. I don't want to watch any match. I really don't like, I prefer football. But when Nole and Fabio played this on this year I always watch their matches.

“They're my biggest idols. I started to play tennis because of him (Fognini) in Italy. I think he's one of the most talented players ever and yeah we have a big relationship, we are good friends. I watch the match here he play on Wimbledon. For me he can continue for many years.”

Fognini, who was making his final appearance at SW19 this year and is expected to retire in 2025, produced a valiant performance in the first round against French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz, before losing in five sets.

The ever-lasting figure of Marin Cilic continues to impress on the ATP Tour. The 36-year-old, who knocked out Jack Draper in the second round, beat Spain's Jaume Munar to set up a clash against the 23-year-old Italian.

The Croatian veteran is no stranger to the big stage. He is back in the fourth round of Wimbledon for the first time since 2017, where he made the final before losing to Roger Federer in five sets.

A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)

Cilic, winner of the 2014 US Open, hit 50 unforced errors against Munar. However, he offset this alarming statistic by totalling 47 winners.

Cobolli and Cilic are set to face off on Monday, with the winner to play either Novak Djokovic or Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Goran Ivanisevic says what he finds 'sad' about the state of men's tennis right now as he makes point about Ben Shelton","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/goran-ivanisevic-says-what-he-finds-sad-about-the-state-of-mens-tennis-right-now-as-he-makes-point-about-ben-shelton/","Sun, 06 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Goran Ivanisevic is unafraid to hold back what he really thinks about the current state of the ATP Tour.

Ivanisevic is the current coach of Stefanos Tsitsipas, beginning their partnership for the grass court season.

The Croatian is used to success as a coach, with Ivanisevic previously mentoring Novak Djokovic and Marin Cilic to a combined 10 Grand Slam titles.

However, things have not got off to the best start, with Ivanisevic publicly criticising Tsitsipas after his first round defeat at Wimbledon.

The 2001 Wimbledon champion has not left it there, with Ivanisevic now making some strong comments about the ATP Tour including Ben Shelton.

In an interview with Clay, Ivanisevic was asked many questions including what he thought about the current state of the ATP Tour.

While he heaped praise on world number four Jack Draper, who was beaten by Cilic at Wimbledon this year, Ivanisevic admitted that he found the instability of the ATP Tour ‘sad'.

The 53-year-old went on to claim that Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz were light years above the rest of the field. 

“Honestly, I first saw Draper when Novak played him in the first round here at Wimbledon in 2021,” said Ivanisevic. “I liked him right away — I saw he could definitely be in the top 10. His rise doesn't surprise me. 

“The rest… it's all unstable — one day someone is fifth, the next day they're seventh or eighth. Tommy Paul, Shelton… I can't say they're better players than Tsitsipas. It's actually a bit sad — they all work hard, but they're light years behind Alcaraz and Sinner. 

“And Novak is still there, though at the end of his career. It's tough — you play, you train, and you know you can't win a Slam — either one or the other will beat you.”

Sinner and Alcaraz have shared the last six Grand Slam titles between them, highlighted by the most recent Roland Garros final that has been called one of the best major finals ever.

After his strong claim about the ATP Tour, Ivanisevic was subsequently asked if he thinks anyone can close the gap.

The only player that he suggested can currently challenge Alcaraz and Sinner at a major is Djokovic, who Ivanisevic has made a Wimbledon prediction about.

“At a smaller event — maybe. At a Slam — no,” answered Ivanisevic. “I don't see anyone who can do that — unless someone beats them up the night before (laughter). I don't see how. 

“Look at the Australian Open final — you had [Alexander] Zverev, world No. 3, a phenomenal player, and that final was a joke — Sascha had zero chance. 

“Then you see the Roland Garros final — that was otherworldly tennis. The only one who can come between them is Novak. Maybe I'm a bit emotional, but he's a contender to win.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

No Bull, no Fluff, No Smudges

July 5, 2025 | FlaglerLive | 1 Comment 

By Michael Lewis

WIMBLEDON, England — I was taller than Reilly Opelka when I first met him.

I tell this to people all the time and they either laugh right away or throw an incredulous look at me.

But it's true. I was 5-foot-5 then, in 2009, and I'm still 5-foot-5 (OK fine, since my hair is mostly gone I'm probably 5'4”). He was around 5-3.

Of course, he was also only 11 years old.

In the 16 years I've known the 7-foot professional tennis player and former Indian Trails Middle School student, I've seen him in all kinds of mental states.

I've seen him joyous, such as when he qualified for the U.S. Open Juniors in 2013, as a 15-year-old, and his parents (George and Lynne) and I stood on a walkway inside Arthur Ashe Stadium and looked at each other and said “Can you believe we're actually here?”

Or when he won his first ATP Tour title, on Long Island at the New York Open in 2019. I was fortunate to be in attendance that whole week, and afterwards he couldn't stop grinning as we reminisced about his first coach, former tennis star Tom Gullikson, and their practice sessions at Grand Haven and elsewhere.

I've seen him surprised, and a little shell-shocked, such as when he won the Junior Boys title at Wimbledon in 2015, and he insisted to me on the phone after the match that it wasn't that big a deal, even though it of course very much was.

I've seen him angry, such as when things weren't going his way during his slow and steady climb up the ladder of the ATP Tour. Like all tennis players (except maybe Jannik Sinner, who never seems to get angry), Opelka has sometimes snapped at lines judges and chair umpires, because this tennis thing is a very frustrating sport.

So yeah, I've seen Opelka in just about every mood there is. But Thursday afternoon, in Interview Room 5 in the Media Pavilion here at Wimbledon, I saw a guy who looked defeated.

Depressed, frustrated and at a loss as to what's going on with his career.

Opelka has worked so hard these last few years to come back from injury; he endured a horrific botched wrist surgery, had another operation to fix it, and was off the pro tour for more two years, until returning last July.

When Opelka finally made it back, he was thrilled just to be healthy again, and knew that he'd need a few months to shake the rust off and start moving back up the tennis ladder.

This is a guy who was No. 17 in the world just a few years ago, and on the verge of making a major Grand Slam breakthrough. Many, including John McEnroe, said he'd win Wimbledon one day, what with his rocketship of a serve that goes above 140 miles per hour and zooms past hapless opponents after hitting the perfectly manicured green grass here.

But it's been eight months, and Thursday at Wimbledon brought another second-round loss, this time to American Brandon Nakashima, in four sets.

“I got dominated,” Opelka told me. “It sucks. I lose second round every week, and it sucks. Something has to change.”

The big 28-year-old, who has lost in the second round of his last four events, said his tough defeats lately aren't physical. He said his body feels “really good” after ramping up and playing a regular schedule of tournaments in 2025. He entered Wimbledon ranked No. 70.

The problem, ironically, is his serve. What has long been his most dangerous weapon is betraying him. When things are going well, Opelka gets 70-75 percent of his first serves in play, and wins 90 percent of those points.

These last few months, Opelka said, he's getting 60 percent of his first serves in, and winning only 75 percent of those points.

“Those are the only numbers that matter,” he said. “Right now my serve is just really really bad.”

Denis Kudla, a former pro who's been a traveling coach for Opelka for the past year, is more optimistic about how his player is doing.

“There's a long way to go but he's getting there,” Kudla said. “Sometimes we all want fast results. Reilly understands the process, and he's a professional. Slow and steady, he's getting there.”

Opelka isn't so sure.

“I'll quit,” he said. “You don't make any money losing second round every week. If I keep losing, I'll just wait until my ranking drops to the point where it's really bad, and then I'll quit.”

I hope this was just frustration talking, because after all the work and effort he's put in, I'd hate to see him quit.

Then again, Opelka has always been a different cat, as they say, who was never totally single-minded about tennis. He's a lover of art, going to galleries in all the European cities he's been to while playing, and has struck up friendships with gallery owners like Tim van Laere in Belgium.

Some players, you wonder what they'd do with themselves all day if they didn't have tennis. Opelka isn't like that. He's got plenty of outside interests. He's smart, well-spoken and could be a great broadcaster if he wanted to be.

If he's not happy and struggling with tennis, then maybe it's good he's thinking of leaving. He's still young, after all.

But I hope that's not the case. He deserves to come all the way back and have the kind of success he was having a few years ago, the kind that seemed preordained all those years ago on the courts of the Palm Coast Tennis Center, the courts that now bear his name.

It would only be fitting for the tallest tennis player in history to reach new heights before he's through.



Michael Lewis has covered Reilly Opelka for FlaglerLive since 2013.

Back when the Tennis Center was being expanded Holland-Alfin of 2021, this was a worst case fear I commented about back then, Alfin would sink money into “courts of dreams” as some investment into the community & the star player that it would be named after wouldn't have longevity for the sport of tennis, not achieve the titles. The tennis associations weren't guaranteeing tournaments for a player that lives in South Florida at this point, has been when tennis center expansion was a huge gamble.

And here we are ? Several injuries and he's a long shot to make it past the 2nd round ? If he continues, he might want to only travel USA tournaments, maybe find a men's or mixed doubles partner ? International travel to lose in the 2nd round constantly, like he says, won't be even career earnings for breakeven for those trips to France (French Open), Italy (Italian Open), Spain (Madrid Open) & England (Wimbledon). Australia & other Asian tournaments might be something he has a better shot at. Hope he gets well. But from the reads of injury after injury, athletes that are 7 feet tall, when their body fails them, walking like a mere mortal is challenging enough.

As the United States chase an end to a decade long wait for a Wimbledon singles champion, it hasn't always been that way.

It is nine years since Serena Williams lifted the Venus Rosewater dish in 2016, while for the men it is 25 years since Peter Sampras won the seventh of his titles at the All England Club.

With the Championships in full swing the US are left with two players standing in both the men's and the women's Round of 16 draws.

Ben Shelton, Taylor Fritz, Emma Navarro and Amanda Anisimova will lead US hopes of following Sampras, Andre Agassi, John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert and the Williams sisters.

Back in the early 1900s a little boy named William “Bill” Johnston who immersed himself in tennis after a natural disaster, was unaware just how much of a legacy he would leave on the sport. 

Born in 1894, Johnston would pick up a racket for the very first time in 1906 when he was just 11-years-old. 

That same year, San Francisco - the seventh largest city in the US– suffered a devastating earthquake which sparked uncontrollable fires that lasted for three days.

Several thousands of lives were lost, and approximately half of the city's population were left homeless. 

As a result, schools were closed for months. 

With surplus time on his hands, Johnston took to the tennis courts to combat boredom and simultaneously hone his skills. 

Four years later at the 1910 Bay Counties junior singles competition, a then-15-year-old Johnston won his first tournament.

Fast-forward to 1915, and he won the U.S. National Men's Singles Championship over Maurice McLoughlin, and then defeated superstar Bill Tilden four years after that. 

Nicknamed “Little” Bill due to his 5-foot-8 stature, Johnston later lived in the shadow of 6-foot-2 “Big” Bill for the remainder of his career, with the latter being considered one of the greatest players of all time. 

The two would form a formidable combination, and together, they helped the Americans to win the Davis Cup in seven consecutive years between 1920-26 - a record for the longest run of unbroken success in the competition's history that began in 1900.

In total, at the Davis Cup he had an exceptional 18-3 overall record, 14-3 of which were singles matches. 

Tilden later wrote about his teammate, and biggest rival, in his 1925 book, ‘Match Play and the Spin of the Ball' about how they would go about playing against each other.  

“Johnston and I play each other from the baseline because we each fear the other's ground stroke too much to come to the net indiscriminately,” Tilden wrote. 

“But in every point we are sparring for an opening that will allow us to take the offensive and carry it to the net position.”

Johnston's singles titles at the US Open in 1915 and 1919 aided in him being ranked No. 1 by the United States Lawn Tennis Association.

During those early years, he was also a serial winner in the doubles format. 

Along with doubles partner Clarence Griffin, won three US Open Grand Slam titles in five years, in 1915, 1916, and 1920. 

Furthermore, he also won the US Open in 1921 when he partnered with then-World No. 3 Mary Brown in the mixed doubles format. 

Already with two singles Grand Slam victories to his name, all of which came on US soil, Johnston was seeking another, though it would take him four years. 

Having travelled over the pond, Johnston defeated fellow American Frank Hunter 6-0, 6-3, 6-1 on his way to becoming the Wimbledon Gentlemen's Singles Champion in 1923. 

It would be his final Grand Slam victory, as he would go on to lose his last three US Open Finals to his biggest rival Tilden in 1923, 1924 and 1925. 

Johnston ultimately wound up as the runner-up in six of his nine total Grand Slam finals between 1915 and 1925. 

Known for his topspin forehead-heavy approach, it is believed that Johnston was the first person to introduce the Western grip, something that is still somewhat of a rarity in the modern game.

Big Bill also wrote in his book about Johnston's forehand.

“The forehand drive of William M. Johnston is unquestionably the greatest single tennis shot in the world, bar none,” Tilden said.

“He seems able to use it with every possible degree of speed, with an accuracy that baffles the fastest court covering, and with a steadiness which has discouraged every opponent he has ever faced. 

""No stroke has ever been developed by any other player to equal its efficiency and general dependability.”

Twenty-four-time Grand Slam winner Djokovic, for example, has used a semi-Western grip throughout his career, though his grips are so intense they give off the impression that they are Western. 

Nadal was the same, and he also found huge success leading him to win four US Open titles and 14 French Open titles during his stellar career. 

Due to its advantages on clay and hard courts, modern day specialists on these surfaces are adopting the Western, which has ultimately seen a rise in its prominence. 

For example, current World No. 4 Iga Swiatek uses it and she has already won the US Open and at Roland-Garros before turning 24-years-old. 

Johnston retired from tennis 1927 at the age of 32 due to health issues, and just 19 years later at the age of 51, he would pass away from a bout of Tuberculosis. 

Nonetheless, the legacy Johnston left behind has undoubtedly shaped tennis as the game we know it to be today.

Kartal wins controversial game after electronic line-calling system fails

Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova said a game was 'stolen' from her when Wimbledon's electronic line-calling system failed during her fourth-round match against Britain's Sonay Kartal.

There was no 'out' call when a Kartal backhand went long at 4-4 in the first set, with chair umpire Nico Helwerth halting play.

Russian Pavlyuchenkova had seen the ball was out -  and a TV replay showed that was the case by some distance.

Addressing the crowd, Helwerth said: ""We're just going to check if the system was up and running, because there was no audio call.""

After a telephone call, he announced the electronic system ""was unfortunately unable to track the last point"" and ordered the point to be replayed.

Umpires can decide to make their own call if the system breaks down and are also entitled to replay the point. 

Had the ball been called out, Pavlyuchenkova would have won the point and taken the lead.

Instead, it was replayed, Kartal won the point and went on to break for a 5-4 lead.

The fact Pavlyuchenkova went on to win the match meant the malfunction was not as costly as it could have been, although she still questioned why the umpire did not call it out.

""That's why he's there,"" she said. ""He also saw it out, he told me after the match. 

""I thought he would do that, but he didn't. Instead they just said replay.

""I don't know if it's something to do [with Kartal being] local.

""I think it's also difficult for him. He probably was scared to take such a big decision.""

The electronic line-calling system did not call the shot from Sonay Kartal out

Pavlyuchenkova was clearly frustrated when she returned to her chair at the end of the game.

She told the umpire: ""I don't know if it's in or out. How do I know? How can you prove it? 

""You took the game away from me ... They stole the game from me. They stole it."" 

A spokesperson for the All England Club said: ""Due to operator error the system was deactivated on the point in question.

""The chair umpire followed the established process.""

The automated line-calling system was introduced at Wimbledon for the first time this year.

Debbie Jevans - chair of the All England Club - said on Friday she was confident in its accuracy and the decision to bring it in.

The umpire explained to the players there had been no line call 

Electronic line-calling technology has been under scrutiny this week at Wimbledon, with a number of players saying they do not trust it.

Such an obvious failure on the biggest stage - on Centre Court, in a match featuring a British player - has ensured this topic will not go away.

Britain's Emma Raducanu has been one of those to voice concerns, saying some of the calls had been ""dodgy"", while former Olympic champion Belinda Bencic said the technology was a topic of discussion among players in the locker room.

Bencic said she was usually a fan of the technology but ""it is not correct"" at this tournament.

Line judges have been replaced by technology at many top-level tournaments, including the US Open and Australian Open.

Jevans previously said the technology was brought in because ""the players wanted it"" and some have backed the system, with former world number one Iga Swiatek saying she has had doubts but ""has to trust"" the calls.

'I can't hear it' - Wimbledon's first day of electronic calling

Britain's Billie Jean King Cup captain Anne Keothavong said the error was something the tournament referee and organisers would have to ""reflect on"" and see ""what could have been done better"".

""If there is uncertainty, that creates anxiety,"" she said on BBC TV. ""They [players] just need to feel reassured that the technology is working and the person who is pressing the buttons is doing the job they are meant to do.

""Hopefully we don't see mistakes like this again.""

Former world number one Tracy Austin said the fault had been a ""one-off"".

""An interesting, dramatic situation that I'm sure we will fix in the future but it was tough to watch for those few minutes,"" the American added.

When there were line judges, players could challenge the calls by using an electronic review. There are no challenges under the current system and video replays are not used.

Sonay Kartal hopes to inspire the next generation of athletes when she continues her Wimbledon campaign on Sunday, making her Centre Court debut.

The British No.3 is through to the second week of a Major for the first time in her career and faces former world No.11 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for a spot in the quarters. After learning she would open Centre Court, Kartal, 23, said: “It's a huge honour to play on that court. A court that you dream of. As a kid, you want to play on it.”

Super-strong Kartal, who stands at just 5 ft and 4” tall, is known for her muscular physique. But she wasn't always into fitness.

The Brighton-based star said: “I wasn't always strong. Yeah, I used to hate fitness back in the day. Lockdown happened, I nothing to do, I turned to it as a bit of an escape, as something to do for a bit of fun.

“Yeah, I was speaking to my fitness coach. We were just trying to get creative. I obviously didn't have crazy weights or anything. So it was just for running or trying to do bodyweight stuff and things like that, and it just completely changed the way I viewed it.

I absolutely loved it. I took it as a bit of like an escape, so then when tennis started to kick back in, it was not a chore at all, I loved it and I'd go to the gym and just kind of have a bit of me time and stick my headphones in and just forget about the world, I guess, and listen to music.”

However, Kartal may have to give up her membership to a high-street budget gym after her Wimbledon run.



The world No.51 added: “It was getting a bit tricky prior, so I do think I'll have to move. But they were actually pretty respectful there, they would just say hello and then let me get on with it. So maybe I'll have to test that when I'm back.”

And Kartal wants girls to feel confident being strong. She added: “I think it's changing, now a lot of girls are getting more comfortable with having more muscle on their body, which is incredible.

“I don't think anyone should feel like girls have to look a certain way, that's changing in tennis as well. You look at the tennis players, everyone's all different physiques and sizes and heights. So, it's definitely getting more versatile, but, I mean, if I can inspire kids, whether that's boys, girls, whatever, then I'm obviously doing something good.”

Three children she hopes to inspire are her nieces and nephew, aged nine, six and four, who have been watching her from afar, and could come to SW19 on Sunday.

Kartal, 23, said: “Their school has been really sweet, they've set up projectors in their classrooms so they've all been watching it and all the kids have done posters.

“My sister's kids aren't the sportiest, but I'm trying to get them into it. I don't think they're going to be the next best tennis player, but if I can get them into some sport, whatever that is, I think that will help them massively.”

Kartal's long-time coach, former British No.1 Julie Hobbs, was responsible for keeping her in tennis when she quite literally almost fell at the first hurdle. Now, the British No.3 wants to be the motivating figure for the next generation.

“At my club, we used to do this thing where the younger kids used to call it the lines game, it's like a little warm-up,” she explained.

“You know, they'd shout ‘service line;, and all the kids had to run the service line and things like that, and that was always the first game and I was too shy for like three months to actually come on court.

“So my coach Julie finally managed to get me to do it, that game, I went on court, I tried to run to, like, outside tram line, tripped over, burst into tears, off I went and yeah, didn't come back for a good couple of months.”

*Rublev 3-1 Alcaraz

Chris BradnamBBC Sport commentator at Wimbledon

They sell the used balls at Wimbledon. I'm not sure you'd want these ones, though.

The dog might even say no.

Jarry 3-6 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-5) 0-2 Norrie*

Gets it!

A second serve gives Cameron Norrie a chance and eventually Nicolas Jarry breaks down with a shot that goes long.

The first break of serve since the eighth game of the first set.

*Jarry 3-6 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-5) 0-1 Norrie

Nicolas Jarry's pace has slowed between service points a little bit.

He played a five-setter in round one against Holger Rune and then came through a tough match in four sets against teenager Joao Fonseca on Friday.

Cameron Norrie celebrates winning a point that gets us to 30-30.

Double fault - break point Norrie...

*Rublev 3-1 Alcaraz

Andrey Rublev gets the break at the first attempt when Carlos Alcaraz catches the ball on the frame of his racquet.

Alcaraz is just looking a little of it at the moment but there's plenty of tennis to be played.

*Jarry 3-6 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-5) 0-1 Norrie

Tim HenmanFormer British number one on BBC Two

It is important to hold the serve to build the scoreboard pressure [when serving first].

When you get to 4-3, if you are the person serving second you are playing catch-up.

You realise a couple of poor shots and it could be all over. A way to go before we can talk about that, though.

Rublev 2-1 Alcaraz*

Carlos Alcaraz's lack of rhythm isn't just tied to his serve, the Spaniard is yet to get into full flow with his all-round game.

A couple of loose forehands - one long and one into the net - hand Andrey Rublev a 0-30 lead.

Alcaraz puts a slice into the net and now has three break points to defend.

All eyes are on Cameron Norrie on Court One but there are many Brits in mixed doubles second-round action around the grounds at Wimbledon.

On court three, David Stevenson and Maia Lumsden are a set down against eighth seeds Mate Pavic and Timea Babos of Croatia and Hungary respectively.

Over on court two, Joe Salisbury and his Brazilian partner Luisa Stefani are a set to the good against Argentine Andres Molteni and American Asia Muhammad, winning the opener on a tie-break 7-6 (9-7).

And Joshua Paris and Eden Silva have been awarded the win on court 18 - their opponents retired after losing the first set 7-6 (7-2).

Neal Skupski and his American partner Desirae Krawczyk are just getting their match under way on court 17.

*Jarry 3-6 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-5) 0-1 Norrie

A solid way to start the final set for Cameron Norrie, who holds serve quite comfortably.

Serving first might be a tiny advantage for the Briton in the decider.

Jarry 3-6 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-5) 0-0 Norrie*

Greg RusedskiFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra 2 and BBC Sounds

Norrie had his chances in that set. Both players are going to need a change of clothes but if I was Jarry, I would not be walking off the court yet because all of the momentum is with him. 

It's going to be about who believes that little bit more. 

Rublev 2-1 Alcaraz*

Carlos Alcaraz steps into the court to strike a forehand but it dips into the net.

Another unforced error from Alcaraz hands over the hold.

Jarry 3-6 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-5) 0-0 Norrie*

Still some way to go for Nicolas Jarry to beat the outright number of aces in a match.

John Isner sent down 113 in that Wimbledon epic with Nicolas Mahut that ended 70-68 in the American's favour in the final set.

Of course we won't have anything like that here! If we get to 6-6 again in the final set, it'll be a champions tie-break (the first to 10 wins it) to decide the winner.

Jarry 3-6 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-5) 0-0 Norrie*

Jonathan JurejkoBBC Sport senior tennis reporter at Wimbledon

It had to end like that, didn't it?

Nicolas Jarry slaps an ace down the middle - his 43rd of the match.

FORTY-THREE!

Sure there will be a few more in the deciding set and reckon that could get him on to the leaderboard for most aces in a Grand Slam match.

*Rublev 1-1 Alcaraz

Andrey Rublev may have settled quickly with that hold to love but Carlos Alcaraz is still finding his rhythm.

A double fault from the five-time Grand Slam champion sees him trail 15-30.

Alcaraz lands just 50% (3/6) of his first serves in but fights back to get the hold to 30.

Jarry 3-6 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-5) 0-0 Norrie*

Cameron Norrie has played two five-set matches at Wimbledon before - and won them both.

He went the full distance in defeating Jaume Munar in the second round and
David Goffin in the quarter-finals, both in 2022.

In his career, he has a 7-7 win-loss record in five-set matches at Tour-level.

Jarry 3-6 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-5) 0-0 Norrie*

Tim HenmanFormer British number one on BBC Two

There is such fine margins.

Such a gutsy effort from Jarry. He has never let his head drop.

He was down in that breaker but he has found a way to get back on level terms.

Jarry 3-6 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-5) 0-0 Norrie*

Both players leave the court at the conclusion of that set.

They've been playing for three hours and 33 minutes on Court One.

Jarry 3-6 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-5) 0-0 Norrie*

We're going all the way!

Another huge ace from Nicolas Jarry, who has fought back from two sets to love down and facing a match point in the third-set tie-break to take us into a decider.

Wow. What a match.

Rublev 1-0 Alcaraz*

Andrey Rublev has only been broken twice in the opening three rounds.

The Russian hasn't played anyone even close to the level of Carlos Alcaraz but lays down an early marker with a hold to love.

*Jarry 3-6 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (9-7) 6-6 (6-5) Norrie

Greg RusedskiFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra 2 and BBC Sounds

Cam needs to be a little bit more offensive. Sometimes it feels like he is waiting for Jarry to make an unforced error. 

Norrie is finally going big down the tee with his serve, that is a good change up from him because every other one was going straight to Jarry's backhand. 

I don't know if my heart can take a fifth set!

*Jarry 3-6 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (9-7) 6-6 (6-5) Norrie

Great hitting from Cameron Norrie off the ground and Nicolas Jarry nets - 5-5.

Oooh, the Briton just long with a forehand! Set point for Jarry to level the match...

Nicolas Jarry accused Cameron Norrie of disturbing him in an angry rant during their fourth-round clash at Wimbledon. Norrie stormed into a 6-3 7-6 lead on Court 1 and then his Chilean opponent tabled his complaints with the umpire.

Norrie headed off court for a toilet break while Jarry remained seated in his courtside chair and moaned about Norrie's second serve. He felt the Brit was bouncing the ball too many times, then looked like he was going to serve before continuing to bounce the ball.

""What is the rule there? The problem is, is it normal to do that when it affects the other player?"" Jarry said to Greek umpire Eva Asderaki-Moore.

""You have to intervene there or I have to suck it. That's the real issue, it doesn't matter the reason. It is the same as hitting the ball anywhere.

""It's not intentional but you have to apply the code as well. How is it now? He perfectly can stop doing it, it's not a nervous tick.

""It's something that he can control. It's not a nervous tick. You think there's nothing I can do so I just have to suck it up, because he does it always.

""That's a reason for me to have to play with something that affects me. It can be changed, it's not something that cannot be changed.""



Asderaki-Moore responded: ""I am going to step in if I think there is a reason to step in.""

But Jarry continued his tirade: ""I don't want to force you into anything. I just want to do what the rules say. And if there is not a rule then tell me and I cannot do anything about it.""

Asderaki-Moore clarified the rule, saying: ""The rule is if it's intentional that he is disturbing then I can do something about it.""

Jarry, walking back onto court as Norrie emerged from the bathroom, concluded: ""Ok so it has to be intentional, if it's not intentional then there's nothing I can do.

""If that's the rule then I don't need you to say something. I just want to play by the rules because it affects me.""

Novak Djokovic is one of many big names to have signed up for the new US Open mixed doubles event.

Djokovic has progressed to the fourth round of Wimbledon for the 17th time in his career after beating his compatriot Miomir Kecmanovic.

Despite not winning a Grand Slam tournament for nearly two years, it has been suggested that Djokovic has sent a message to Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz after his latest victory.

Although Djokovic's current focus is on Wimbledon, he also appears to have one eye on the revamped US Open mixed doubles event.

The US Open has completely revamped their mixed doubles event this year, changing the format, number of teams and giving priority to singles players.

Due to this decision, the US Open has received a lot of criticism including from the defending mixed doubles champions.

Despite this, the US Open has announced a blockbuster initial lineup that includes Emma Raducanu and Alcaraz, Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe, as well as Sinner and Emma Navarro.

Djokovic will partner his fellow Serbian Olga Danilovic, and he has now revealed that she was the first name that came to his mind when the new US Open mixed doubles event was announced.

The 24-time Grand Slam champion also acknowledged criticism of the event, but suggested that he thought the US Open had made a good move in terms of entertainment.

“When I heard about the new change of the mixed doubles event at the US Open, she [Danilovic] was the first one I thought of, you know, I want to play with a Serbian player and you know, she's obviously the top right now, so we were both excited, you know,” Djokovic said in his Wimbledon press conference. “So it's going to be fun, you know.

“I know that there's quite divided opinions on whether this should have taken place, this change or not. I understand the arguments on both sides, to be honest. But I guess in terms of the fun and entertainment and attracting the top players and singles, both men, women, that's what they got with this change.

“But I do, again, I do understand the arguments on the other side saying, you know, two days, short format, you shouldn't be named at Grand Slam champion, but it is what it is, and the US Open, or USTA makes these decisions, and I'm excited to do that, to play that.

“A mixed doubles event. It's a very short couple day event, but I think it should be very, very entertaining.”

Djokovic has made five Grand Slam appearances in men's doubles, but never in mixed competition.

However, he has played a mixed doubles tournament before at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.

On that occasion he partnered another Serbian in Nina Stojanovic, with the pair making it all the way to the semi-finals.

However, they lost that semi-final and Djokovic would then controversially withdraw from their subsequent bronze medal match.

Djokovic will be hoping to improve on his Tokyo Olympics performance when he partners with Danilovic at the US Open, but first he will focus on Wimbledon.

The 38-year-old will now face 11th seed Alex de Minaur, who he has won two of his three previous meetings against.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Taylor Fritz picks up the win to reach Wimbledon's quarterfinals after Jordan Thompson is forced to retire early because of injury. (0:48)

American Taylor Fritz moved into the Wimbledon quarterfinals for the third time in four years on Sunday, advancing when his injured opponent, Jordan Thompson, retired while trailing 6-1, 3-0 after 41 minutes.

With Fritz advancing, it's the fifth consecutive major in which at least one American man has made the quarterfinals -- the longest streak for the U.S. men since a run of six straight from the 2002 US Open to 2004 Australian Open.

The unseeded Thompson's movement and power clearly were compromised. The Australian entered the match with back and leg issues and left the court for a medical timeout in the second set, then stopped after trying to play for three more points.

""Just got significantly worse today,"" said Thompson, who was competing in singles and doubles at Wimbledon. ""Just played a lot of tennis on a body that shouldn't have been, and it just took its toll.""

Thompson has had a couple of retirements at majors before, most recently the 2023 US Open against Botic Van De Zandschulp because of a leg injury. He was also forced to exit his 2021 Australian Open match against Casper Ruud with a shoulder injury.

For the No. 5-seeded Fritz, it was a shorter workday after playing a pair of five-setters and one four-setter earlier in the tournament.

""It's obviously not the way that I want to go through,"" Fritz said. ""It's just sad. ... Respect to him for coming out. His body's not right.""

Fritz and Ben Shelton, who advanced to the round of 16 with his straight-sets win Saturday, are the only Americans remaining in the men's singles draw. Looking ahead, only two American men in the past 15 years have reached the Wimbledon semifinals: Sam Querrey in 2017 and John Isner in 2018.

Fritz next faces Russian 17th seed Karen Khachanov, who reached his second Wimbledon quarterfinal by beating Kamil Majchrzak 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 earlier Sunday.

""To be honest, today was a really great performance -- at least from my side,"" said Khachanov, who finished with more than twice as many winners as unforced errors (44-21).

The 109th-ranked Majchrzak was playing in a fourth-round match at a major for the first time. He was on a six-match Grand Slam losing streak before Wimbledon.

Khachanov has been a Grand Slam semifinalist twice, at the US Open in 2022 and the Australian Open in 2023. Fritz made it that far for the first time when he got to the final at Flushing Meadows in September before losing to No. 1 Jannik Sinner.

Fritz is 12-1 on grass this season, having won titles at Stuttgart and Eastbourne. His 12 tour-level grass match wins are the most by any American man in a season since Pete Sampras won 12 in 1999 at Queen's Club and Wimbledon.

U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz moved into the Wimbledon quarterfinals when Jordan Thompson quit with an injury in the second set of their fourth-round match

LONDON — U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz moved into the Wimbledon quarterfinals for the third time in four years on Sunday, advancing when his injured opponent, Jordan Thompson , quit while trailing 6-1, 3-0 after 41 minutes.

The unseeded Thompson's movement and power clearly were compromised. The Australian entered the match with back and leg issues and left the court for a medical timeout in the second set, then stopped after trying to play for three more points.

“Just got significantly worse today,” said Thompson, who was competing in singles and doubles at Wimbledon. “Just played a lot of tennis on a body that shouldn't have been, and it just took its toll.”

For the No. 5-seeded Fritz , it was a shorter workday after playing a pair of five-setters and one four-setter earlier in the tournament.

“It's obviously not the way that I want to go through,” Fritz said. “It's just sad. ... Respect to him for coming out. His body's not right.”

Now the American will meet No. 17 seed Karen Khachanov of Russia on Tuesday for a berth in the semifinals — a round neither has reached at the All England Club.

Khachanov has been a Grand Slam semifinalist twice, at the U.S. Open in 2022 and the Australian Open in 2023. Fritz made it that far at a major for the first time when he got to the final at Flushing Meadows in September before losing to No. 1 Jannik Sinner.

Khachanov beat Kamil Majchrzak 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 Sunday and is 2-0 against Fritz, although their most recent meeting was in 2020.

“We practice all the time, so we're pretty familiar with each other's games,” Fritz said. “But I think I improved a ton and have become a much, much better player since the last time we played.”

No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka reached the quarterfinals at her 11th consecutive Grand Slam tournament, defeating No. 24 Elise Mertens 6-4, 7-6 (4), and will play Laura Siegemund , the 37-year-old German who followed up her elimination of Australian Open champ Madison Keys by beating lucky loser Solana Sierra 6-3, 6-2. When Siegemund's age was mentioned during an on-court interview, the crowd applauded, and she joked: “It's not that often you get such a compliment for being old.” Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova overcame a missed call late in the first set when the electronic system that replaced line judges at Wimbledon this year was shut off but ended up beating Sonay Kartal 7-6 (3), 6-4 to return to the grass-court major's quarterfinals for the first time in nine years. Pavlyuchenkova's opponent Tuesday will be No. 13 Amanda Anisimova or No. 30 Linda Noskova. The men's matches later Sunday were two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz vs. No. 14 Andrey Rublev, and Cam Norrie vs. Nicolas Jarry.

The quarterfinals will be set after Monday's play, which leads off at Centre Court with 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic against No. 11 Alex de Minaur at 1:30 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. ET). They were supposed to face each other in last year's quarterfinals at Wimbledon, but de Minaur was forced to withdraw before the match with a hip injury. That's to be followed by No. 7 Mirra Andreeva vs. No. 10 Emma Navarro , who eliminated 2024 champion Barbora Krejcikova in the third round, and then No. 1 Jannik Sinner vs. No. 19 Grigor Dimitrov. Others in action: Iga Swiatek, Ben Shelton and Marin Cilic.

As the United States chase an end to a decade long wait for a Wimbledon singles champion, it hasn't always been that way.

It is nine years since Serena Williams lifted the Venus Rosewater dish in 2016, while for the men it is 25 years since Peter Sampras won the seventh of his titles at the All England Club.

With the Championships in full swing the US are left with two players standing in both the men's and the women's Round of 16 draws.

Ben Shelton, Taylor Fritz, Emma Navarro and Amanda Anisimova will lead US hopes of following Sampras, Andre Agassi, John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert and the Williams sisters.

Back in the early 1900s a little boy named William “Bill” Johnston who immersed himself in tennis after a natural disaster, was unaware just how much of a legacy he would leave on the sport. 

Born in 1894, Johnston would pick up a racket for the very first time in 1906 when he was just 11-years-old. 

That same year, San Francisco - the seventh largest city in the US– suffered a devastating earthquake which sparked uncontrollable fires that lasted for three days.

Several thousands of lives were lost, and approximately half of the city's population were left homeless. 

As a result, schools were closed for months. 

With surplus time on his hands, Johnston took to the tennis courts to combat boredom and simultaneously hone his skills. 

Four years later at the 1910 Bay Counties junior singles competition, a then-15-year-old Johnston won his first tournament.

Fast-forward to 1915, and he won the U.S. National Men's Singles Championship over Maurice McLoughlin, and then defeated superstar Bill Tilden four years after that. 

Nicknamed “Little” Bill due to his 5-foot-8 stature, Johnston later lived in the shadow of 6-foot-2 “Big” Bill for the remainder of his career, with the latter being considered one of the greatest players of all time. 

The two would form a formidable combination, and together, they helped the Americans to win the Davis Cup in seven consecutive years between 1920-26 - a record for the longest run of unbroken success in the competition's history that began in 1900.

In total, at the Davis Cup he had an exceptional 18-3 overall record, 14-3 of which were singles matches. 

Tilden later wrote about his teammate, and biggest rival, in his 1925 book, ‘Match Play and the Spin of the Ball' about how they would go about playing against each other.  

“Johnston and I play each other from the baseline because we each fear the other's ground stroke too much to come to the net indiscriminately,” Tilden wrote. 

“But in every point we are sparring for an opening that will allow us to take the offensive and carry it to the net position.”

Johnston's singles titles at the US Open in 1915 and 1919 aided in him being ranked No. 1 by the United States Lawn Tennis Association.

During those early years, he was also a serial winner in the doubles format. 

Along with doubles partner Clarence Griffin, won three US Open Grand Slam titles in five years, in 1915, 1916, and 1920. 

Furthermore, he also won the US Open in 1921 when he partnered with then-World No. 3 Mary Brown in the mixed doubles format. 

Already with two singles Grand Slam victories to his name, all of which came on US soil, Johnston was seeking another, though it would take him four years. 

Having travelled over the pond, Johnston defeated fellow American Frank Hunter 6-0, 6-3, 6-1 on his way to becoming the Wimbledon Gentlemen's Singles Champion in 1923. 

It would be his final Grand Slam victory, as he would go on to lose his last three US Open Finals to his biggest rival Tilden in 1923, 1924 and 1925. 

Johnston ultimately wound up as the runner-up in six of his nine total Grand Slam finals between 1915 and 1925. 

Known for his topspin forehead-heavy approach, it is believed that Johnston was the first person to introduce the Western grip, something that is still somewhat of a rarity in the modern game.

Big Bill also wrote in his book about Johnston's forehand.

“The forehand drive of William M. Johnston is unquestionably the greatest single tennis shot in the world, bar none,” Tilden said.

“He seems able to use it with every possible degree of speed, with an accuracy that baffles the fastest court covering, and with a steadiness which has discouraged every opponent he has ever faced. 

""No stroke has ever been developed by any other player to equal its efficiency and general dependability.”

Twenty-four-time Grand Slam winner Djokovic, for example, has used a semi-Western grip throughout his career, though his grips are so intense they give off the impression that they are Western. 

Nadal was the same, and he also found huge success leading him to win four US Open titles and 14 French Open titles during his stellar career. 

Due to its advantages on clay and hard courts, modern day specialists on these surfaces are adopting the Western, which has ultimately seen a rise in its prominence. 

For example, current World No. 4 Iga Swiatek uses it and she has already won the US Open and at Roland-Garros before turning 24-years-old. 

Johnston retired from tennis 1927 at the age of 32 due to health issues, and just 19 years later at the age of 51, he would pass away from a bout of Tuberculosis. 

Nonetheless, the legacy Johnston left behind has undoubtedly shaped tennis as the game we know it to be today.

Novak Djokovic has become only the second men's player to reach 100 match wins at Wimbledon, but how does his record compare to his two great rivals Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer at the four respective Grand Slams?

The 24-time Grand Slam winner is only the second male after Federer (105) to record a century a victories at Wimbledon, although both are behind the great Martina Navratilova in terms of most-ever wins at the All England Club for both men and women as the nine-time champion has 120 wins.

For Djokovic, though, it is yet another milestone on his impressive list of achievements with win No 100 coming with a straight-set win over Miomir Kecmanovic in the third round at this year's grass-court Grand Slam.

“That sounds very nice. I am very grateful and privileged to be in this position. Tennis made me who I am and has given me incredible things in life. I never take anything for granted, especially at this age,” the Serbian said.

“I am still pushing myself to the limits and getting some splits and slides on the court. Wimbledon is a dream tournament of so many of us players. Any history here is a blessing.”

Interestingly, although Djokovic is the only player to have 90 or more match wins at all the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, he doesn't have the outright record in any of the majors.

Not yet anyway.

Although Djokovic holds the record for most titles as he has won the season-opening Grand Slam 10 times, he is actually second on the list for most match wins.

Federer won only six trophies at Melbourne Park, but he won a record 102 match wins before retiring in 2022.

Djokovic, though, looks set to surpass that milestone as the Serbian currently sits on 99 while two-time champion Nadal had 77 wins Down Under.

With 14 titles at Roland Garros, Nadal was always going to be No 1 with match wins in Paris as he has a record 112 victories with only four (4) defeats in 19 main draw appearances.

But Djokovic has also reached the 100-win milestone as he achieved it during the 2025 edition of the clay-court Grand Slam as he moved to 101.

Federer is a distant third with 73 wins.

Federer won eight Wimbledon trophies and he recorded his 100th win in 2019, but won only another five matches at SW19 before retiring.

The Swiss's record is in danger of being broken by Djokovic, but the good news for Federer is it won't be this year as the Serbian can only move up to 104 if he wins the title.

The grass-court major is Nadal's worst in terms of the Slams as he won 58 matches at Wimbledon, having made only 15 main draw appearances.

First things first, Jimmy Connors has the record for most victories at the US Open as he won 98 matches.

Djokovic, though, sits second with 90 and he could potentially move to 97 this year, but then he would have to win the tournament.

Five-time US Open champion Federer retired with 89 while Nadal – a four-time champion in New York – notched up 67 wins during his career.

Djokovic might not hold the record for the individual tournaments, but he has the record for total Grand Slam wins as he sits on 390 and counting, ahead of Federer (369) and Nadal (314).

                Siegemund meets history-maker Sierra in a battle of grit and momentum.            

Laura Siegemund will face history-making lucky loser Solana Sierra in the Wimbledon 2025 fourth round, a matchup few predicted, but one that's now impossible to ignore. Sierra, Argentina's No. 1, has become the first lucky loser in the Open Era to reach the second week at Wimbledon, taking out ninth seed Paula Badosa, Katie Boulter, and Cristina Bucsa, all in grueling three-setters.

Siegemund, meanwhile, has breezed past her opposition, including sixth seed Madison Keys, Leylah Fernandez, and Peyton Stearns, all in straight sets. While singles success has largely disappointed her this season, she's remained sharp through doubles, picking up a title in Nottingham and a runner-up finish in Adelaide. Despite modest singles numbers with 10 aces and 59.4% first-serve points won, 32.2% break-point conversion shows her opportunistic edge.

Sierra's rise has mostly come through the Challenger circuit, with a title in Antalya and deep runs in Cancun and Valencia. Until now, she hadn't advanced past the first round at a main-draw WTA event this year, making her Wimbledon surge all the more stunning. With a 55.6% first-serve win rate and 40% break-point conversion, Sierra may lack top-tier polish, but her grit is undeniable.

Laura Siegemund and Solana Sierra don't have a head-to-head yet.

Sierra's dream run has captured imaginations, but Siegemund's experience and clean, straight-set wins suggest she's peaking at the right time. Expect the German to edge it in a tighter-than-expected contest.

Taylor Fritz advanced to the Wimbledon quarter-finals for the third time on Sunday when Australian Jordan Thompson was forced to retire due to injury. The fifth-seeded American led Tompson 6-1, 3-0 when the 31-year-old ended play on No. 1 Court due to back pain.

Fritz arrived in London off the back of a record fourth Eastbourne title last week and was pushed to his limits in his opening two matches at SW19. The No. 5 player in the PIF ATP Rankings rallied from the brink to defeat Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in five sets in the first round and then went the distance against Gabriel Diallo in round two. He downed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in four sets in the third round.

Having spent nine hours and 43 minutes on court through his first three matches, Fritz was on the grass for just 40 minutes against Thompson, who had heavy strapping on his right leg and struggled with a back issue in the pair's third Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

""It is not the way I want to go through,"" Fritz said. ""I was really excited to play Jordan today. I was excited to play some good tennis and it is just sad. He has been battling. He has been playing five setters. He was out playing a long doubles match yesterday, so he has been battling out here and respect to him for coming out. His body is not right, so I feel bad for him and hope he feels better.""

Fritz is through to the quarter-finals of Wimbledon with a 6-1 3-0 lead, as Thompson is forced to retire in the second set… @wimbledon | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/xbq3hdUKld

Fritz is 12th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and will hope to lift himself into the Top 10 with victory in the quarter-finals against Karen Khachanov. Fritz will hope to return to Italy for the prestigious year-end event in 2025, having advanced to the title match at the Nitto ATP Finals last season (l. to Jannik Sinner).

Thompson won five setters in his first two matches and defeated Luciano Darderi in four sets in the third round. Earlier this week the Australian opened up on playing through the pain of injury. The World No. 44 was competing in the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time.



Fritz's next opponent, Khachanov, ended the run of Pole Kamil Majchrzak with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 triumph on No. 2 Court. Khachanov, a quarter-finalist at SW19 in 2021, rallied from 2-5 down against Nuno Borges in the fifth set to advance to the fourth round and backed that up with a comfortable win against Majchrzak.

The seven-time tour-level titlist struck 44 winners to 21 unforced errors and broke Majchrzak's serve six times to advance after one hour and 48 minutes. Khachanov is now 8-2 on grass this year, having reached the semi-finals at the ATP 500 event in Halle.

Will the American's trend of dropping at least one set in all of his matches so far continue?ByZachary CohenPublished Jul 06, 2025 copy_link

In one of our first plays for Wimbledon, we took the Over on 3.5 sets in a meeting between Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard and Taylor Fritz. That ended up being a thrilling five-set battle, played over the course of two days because of the All England Club curfew.Fritz ended up winning that match, and a few rounds later he's set to face off with Jordan Thompson with a spot in the quarterfinals on the line. Like that match against Mpetshi Perricard, this is one the American should win. However, also like that first-round match, it's one that could go four or five sets.It's no secret that Fritz thrives on grass. The American recently won his fourth Eastbourne title, and he did it after having won another grass title in Stuttgart two weeks earlier. Fritz is now 44-25 on grass in his career—and that 63.8% winning percentage is the best he has on any surface. His serve is just very difficult for opponents to deal with in slicker conditions and his ability to move and go big from the back of the court is also massive, especially considering he has some serious rally tolerance to go with all of that.

Hall of Famer Analysis + Match Highlights: It's Wimbledon Primetime, on Tennis Channel.

All of that might sound like a case for Fritz, right? Well, I'm going somewhere with it. And where I'm going is that Thompson and Fritz have split wins in their two career meetings. The one win for the Australian came at Queen's Club last year, 6-4, 6-3 victory. Thompson is a good grass-court competitor and while he isn't built like other big servers on the ATP Tour, does have a pretty lethal serve. He's also good at coming to the net to follow them up, and he's more than happy to grind from the baseline.There's a reason Thompson is 35-32 on grass in his career, and this is the only surface in which the Australian has a winning record at the ATP level. So, he's not going to be uncomfortable out there, like most players are when it comes to this surface. And he's not going to be intimidated either.When I first saw this matchup, and the lopsided odds, I knew I'd want to try and jump on Thompson in some capacity. A play on the Over 3.5 sets is more or less a play on Thompson to win one. We're just getting a better price on the Over than we would for Thompson +2.5 sets, which is heavily juiced. And if we lose because Thompson wins in straights, we'll just tip our caps to the Australian and go to work on the Monday slate.Pick: Over 3.5 Sets (-143)

2025 British Grand Prix: Norris crosses the line to take his first British Grand Prix victory

Ferrari set the pace as cars returned to the track for final practice at Silverstone, with Charles Leclerc coming out on top.

Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc topped the timesheets during Saturday's final practice session for the British Grand Prix, leading the way from McLaren rival Oscar Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen – as rookies Gabriel Bortoleto and Ollie Bearman endured late crashes.

After a bright and warm first day at Silverstone, topped by home favourite Lando Norris, cloudy, cooler conditions greeted the drivers for FP3, which gave them one more chance to tweak their cars ahead of the mid-afternoon Qualifying hour.

When the session got under way at a slightly delayed time of 1135, drivers gradually trickled out on track to begin their programmes and assess the conditions – Pirelli's soft, medium and hard compound tyres all being used in the opening minutes.

Lewis Hamilton was one of the early movers when the action got under way, bolting on a set of soft tyres and clocking a 1m 26.529s to hold the provisional P1 spot, which prompted plenty of cheers from the packed grandstand and grass banks around the track.

FORMULA 1 QATAR AIRWAYS BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2025

As per Friday's running, there were some significant gusts of wind for Hamilton and the rest of the drivers to deal with – seemingly highlighted when Lance Stroll drifted his way out of the Luffield hairpin and just about prevented his Aston Martin from spinning.

Kimi Antonelli also reported a “massive moment” through the Maggotts and Becketts complex when he began to push, while there was drama for Alex Albon when he faced a slow-moving Aston Martin at the entry to Copse and swore over the radio to express his frustration.

As for lap times, Leclerc used the soft tyres to get down to a 1m 25.922s and take over from team mate Hamilton in P1, a couple of tenths clear of a more competitive looking Max Verstappen, who nonetheless complained of brake bias difficulties.

“A little bit of rain,” Leclerc then commented over the radio with around 20 minutes to go, but it was nowhere near enough to stop drivers from pumping in laps on slicks and making improvements – George Russell proving this when he slotted into second position.

With some 15 minutes remaining, Norris sent the home crowd wild again by going quickest on a 1m 25.606s, followed closely by Verstappen and team mate Piastri via similarly significant gains, before Leclerc fired in a 1m 25.498s to reclaim P1.

Hamilton was also on a rapid lap at this point, hitting the Sector 2 beam 0.074s clear of Leclerc, only for the red flag to be thrown for debris on track – meaning he had to abandon the effort. “We think the bodywork might be yours,” was the subsequent message to Haas driver Bearman.

The session resumed with a few minutes to go but was soon halted again when Gabriel Bortoleto lost control of his Kick Sauber through the aforementioned Maggotts/Becketts sweeps, bounced over the grass and ended in the gravel with suspension damage.

It meant Leclerc ended up fastest over Piastri, Verstappen and Norris, with Yuki Tsunoda an encouraging fifth for Red Bull, Bearman taking sixth despite another moment late on when he misjudged his entry to the pit lane, spun and damaged his front wing, and Albon putting Williams back into the top 10 positions.

Russell was the fastest of the Mercedes cars on a so far difficult weekend for the Silver Arrows, placing eighth over the Racing Bulls of Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson, Hamilton, and the other Williams and Haas machines of Carlos Sainz and Esteban Ocon.

Next up was Antonelli in 14th, as the Saubers of Nico Hulkenberg and Bortoleto along with the Aston Martins and Alpines brought up the rear – Fernando Alonso placing in front of Franco Colapinto, Stroll and Pierre Gasly.

Alonso reacts to P9 finish - 'It feels like we lost an opportunity to score more points'

Ollie Bearman has been hit with a grid penalty following a red flag infringement during third and final practice at Silverstone.

Ollie Bearman has been handed a 10-place grid penalty for the British Grand Prix following a red flag infringement during the weekend's third and final practice hour.

The session had already proven eventful for Bearman, the Haas driver earlier sparking a red flag after losing a piece of bodywork from his car out on track which resulted in the marshals having to retrieve the part.

But there was worse to come for the Briton when a second red flag was thrown in the latter stages owing to Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto spinning off and becoming beached in the gravel.

As he headed into the pit lane, Bearman had a spin of his own and hit the barriers, losing the front wing from his VF-25 in the process.

With the incident happening under red flag conditions, it was subsequently investigated by the stewards who opted to hand the 20-year-old a grid drop of 10 places for Sunday's race.

A document released following the stewards' hearing reads: “Car 87 had slowed down for the red flag and as he was approaching Turn 15 accelerated significantly to race pace and entered the pit entry road at 260kph. He lost control of the car in the pit entry road and crashed into the barriers.

“Art. 37.6 (a) of the Formula One Sporting Regulations and Art. 2.5.4.1(b) of Appendix H of the International Sporting Code require that when a red flag is shown ‘all cars must immediately reduce speed and proceed slowly back to the pit lane'.

“It is beyond doubt that the driver of Car 87 did not proceed slowly back to the pit lane when he accelerated to simulate entering into the pit entry road under race conditions.

“In fact, we looked at a previous in-lap under normal racing conditions and found that he was faster in this lap, under a red flag.

“To make matters worse, he lost control of the car and crashed into the barriers while at speed. The driver informed us that he misjudged the fact that his brakes were not warm because the lap was done slowly, due to the red flag.

“While this may have been a factor contributing to the crash, we did not consider it to be a mitigating factor.”

As well as the grid penalty, Bearman has also received four penalty points, bringing the total on his licence up to eight.

The British driver is competing in his first home Grand Prix as an F1 driver, with last year's event at Silverstone being where the youngster's deal to race for Haas in 2025 was announced.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen held firm from pole position as the charging McLaren of Oscar Piastri chased him down at the race start for the British Grand Prix.

Polesitter Max Verstappen held off the McLarens of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris during a chaotic start to the British Grand Prix.

With the Formation Lap at Silverstone starting behind the Safety Car, and the entire field on intermediate tyres, top-10 starters Charles Leclerc and George Russell dove into the pit lane to switch for slicks - along with the likes of Isack Hadjar, Gabriel Bortoleto and Ollie Bearman.

As the lights went out for the standing start, the cars that took to the grid launched off the line in the damp conditions with Verstappen holding off the charging McLaren duo behind him.

Later in the lap Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson was forced to retire after colliding with Haas' Esteban Ocon, with a Virtual Safety Car needing to be called upon.

Charles Leclerc topped the third and final practice session ahead of the British Grand Prix, which was disrupted by two red flags.

Charles Leclerc topped the third and final practice session ahead of the British Grand Prix, as the top three drivers were covered by less than one-tenth of a second.

The Ferrari driver posted a 1m 25.498s in much cooler conditions than Friday, which left him just 0.068s clear of Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen a further 0.019s back.

Drivers were unable to improve in the final moments at Silverstone following two red flags in quick succession, the first due to debris heading into Stowe that thwarted Lewis Hamilton's best effort as the Ferrari driver finished outside the top 10.

The second stoppage came at the very end of the one-hour session, Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto losing control through Maggotts and Becketts and finishing in the gravel with suspension damage, while Haas' Ollie Bearman hit the barrier on the entry to the pits.

Luke Browning's methodical approach has put the Williams Racing Development driver in with a chance of the Formula 2 title as the championship heads to his home round at Silverstone.

“Going into Formula 2, I wanted to study what this championship needs in order to get the most out of it and to achieve the most amount of points to win, that's the end goal.

“That's how my brain works generally. I think anyone that knows me knows that I'm quite a complex character. I can be aggressive, I can be chilled out. I can be calculated or impulsive. So depending on the circumstances, I'll adapt who I am.”

It's a methodical approach that has paid dividends so far for Luke Browning as the Hitech TGR Formula 2 driver is one of several title-contending rookies impressing this season heading into his home event at Silverstone this weekend.

The Williams Racing Development talent led the Drivers' Championship earlier in the campaign, and currently lies fifth in the standings, just 31 points behind leader Richard Verschoor at the halfway point.

The revamped approach towards a title fight in the junior category has brought about strong results, with Browning claiming five podiums in the campaign so far. After coming up short in F3 last season, eventually finishing third overall with Hitech, Browning hopes 2025 will finally be the year things go his way.

“I think the issue for me last year was that I probably didn't approach things with that mentality. I approached it wanting all the glory, as many wins as possible, double podiums, pole when I'm already leading the championship.

“This year, I'm okay with a top six or a top seven, just to get points in both races and move on.

""I think last year I'd have gone ‘right, let's keep the momentum going, I want to be on pole here because the car was last year'. So that's probably the biggest change in terms of mindset.”

Browning is aiming to follow in the footsteps of a stellar rookie class that graduated onto the 2025 Formula 1 grid.

Oliver Bearman, Kimi Antonelli, Isack Hadjar and 2024 F2 Champion Gabriel Bortoleto have each had their moments to shine already this season in F1, and Browning is eager to emulate the examples left by each of them.

The Hitech driver feels that he has what it takes to show he's ready for the step up to the highest level. For that to happen, however, he understands that strong results in F2 are the foundation to those aspirations.

“I'm happy for all of those guys, I really am. I think each of them that have moved up really deserve it,” said Browning. “I did Macau with Isack, and I raced a couple of years with Gabi, but I also spend a lot of time online with him sim racing, and these guys are all super talented.

“I obviously raced Ollie back in Formula 3, so to see these guys that I've raced with go and do it and be up there in Formula 1, it's fantastic.

“You look at the results and see Bortoleto beating Hulkenberg in his first Qualifying of the year. Hadjar's got nearly more points combined than his two team mates in different cars. It shows what the new generation can do it if they're given the right opportunity.

“I believe that I'm now ready to have that opportunity and to make that jump. The thought makes me even more motivated. That goal is always there, but being honest, the focus is Formula 2 and I think I really need to do a good job this year and then come December, we can have a good result.

“That's when I can start thinking about opportunities. I just want to do the absolute best job that I can and really nail it.”

Browning took part in Free Practice 1 for the Bahrain Grand Prix earlier this season, his second appearance on a Grand Prix weekend with Williams after filling the same role in Abu Dhabi last year.

He finished the Bahrain session as the highest-placed rookie, and while run plans and fuel loads can't be accounted for, it was important momentum for his season.

With his impressive results so far in F2, the spotlight is beginning to shine a little brighter on him. Browning says it's something he feels ready to cope with, even if there remain a few ‘pinch me' moments along the way.

“I was just over at Williams actually before this interview. It's really funny - I had my first interview with Anthony Davidson on the Sky Pad at the Williams motorhome, and it was quite surreal,” said Browning.

“It's funny because you watch all of this from such a young age and then you're there doing it yourself. It's funny how these things work out, but when you do these kinds of results, the bigger things start to follow, and at the moment, we're doing the job.”

Browning's junior career has largely been spent in Hitech colours, and he's claimed multiple titles with the British outfit along the way, including the GB3 and British F4 championships in 2022 and 2020.

With Formula 1 teams looking to rookie talent more regularly and his current form putting him firmly in title contention, there's just one accolade left to achieve, and Browning says this is his best chance to do it.

“I love Hitech, there's no one I want to win with more in the paddock. These guys deserve it, and it's been a long time coming. I hope that we keep going with our processes, and that I can give them a good result at the end of the year. It would be a really nice way to end my junior career,” he said.

“The goal is to win the championship. If it's going to be enough - I can only tell you at the end of the year, but I've never been more motivated to do the prep, to really approach this so thoroughly and I feel comfortable and confident with the people I've got around me.

“I don't feel like I can be knocked down, so if we can continue like that, it will be a good result at the end of the year. But we've got to do our absolute best and continue with this process we've got. So let's see. I believe it will be enough, but equally, we've still got to execute on that.”

Alonso reacts to P9 finish - 'It feels like we lost an opportunity to score more points'

2025 British Grand Prix: Norris crosses the line to take his first British Grand Prix victory

Previous

Current

Take a look at all of the odds for this weekend's British Grand Prix, from polesitters to race winners and everything in between.

Formula 1 moves on from Spielberg to Silverstone for the British Grand Prix, with title challenger Lando Norris one of several home drivers targeting success. But what do the odds tell us about the weekend ahead? Read on to find out...

Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet.

The McLaren drivers are back on top of the podium in this category. Norris redeemed himself after his mishap in Montreal to take the chequered flag at the Red Bull Ring and close the gap on his team mate in the championship.

Norris is yet to stand on top of the podium at his home Grand Prix, but he has come close in the last two editions, with a runner-up and top-three return.

Championship leader Oscar Piastri finished fourth on his last visit to Silverstone, but has matured significantly over the past 12 months, registering nine podiums this campaign, including five victories.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen suffered his first DNF of the season in Austria, after being taken out by Kimi Antonelli on the opening lap, and is back at a venue where he has only taken the spoils on two occasions.

Mercedes' drivers are always worth considering at Silverstone, considering their impressive record of nine victories in the last 13 races in England. However, their top dog George Russell has faced some struggles at this venue, producing a best return of fifth, despite growing up only two hours from the track.

The top three drivers in the standings are heavily favoured to snatch a podium this weekend. These individuals have accumulated 23 podiums between them this campaign, but Verstappen lines up after registering his maiden DNF of 2025.

Charles Leclerc is spraying champagne regularly at the moment, entering the top three in three of his previous four starts. The Monegasque's recent consistency results in an average finish of 3.8, highlighting his threat to the rostrum.

Lewis Hamilton returns home with an astounding record of 12 consecutive podiums at this track. The seven-time World Champion is the defending champion in the United Kingdom, and despite his wobbly form this year, remains a contender.

Hamilton is still hunting his maiden Sunday podium with Ferrari, and he has a great chance to do it here.

The papaya duo boast the most top sixes in the championship, with 10 apiece. Piastri has been inside that threshold in every start since Shanghai, while a DNF in Montreal is Norris' only blemish.

Rookie Antonelli is a six-time top-six finisher this term, including a maiden F1 top three in Canada. However, he's proven erratic in recent rounds, failing to finish three of his last five starts on Sunday and ending 18th in Monaco.

Alex Albon blasted into 2025 with three top-six outings in his first seven starts, before his campaign was doused and brought back to reality. The Thai-British driver has earned a DNF next to his name in the previous three races, but he was only culpable in Spain, when he collided with Liam Lawson.

Albon's vehicle let him down in Montreal and Austria, and brought about a bigger discussion about what's going on at Williams. His team mate Carlos Sainz couldn't even start the showdown at Spielberg after his brakes overheated and burst into flames after the formation lap.

Besides the aforementioned event winner, podium, and top six favourites, we turn our focus to two veterans to lead the charge for a top 10.

Fernando Alonso is starting to develop consistency in his Aston Martin, with three consecutive top 10s, including back-to-back seventh places in Canada and Austria. The other seasoned campaigner is Nico Hulkenberg, who is also on a run of three races inside the top 10.

Haas' senior driver, Esteban Ocon, continues to compete for a spot in the first 10. The Frenchman has registered the feat five times in 2025, three in his previous four races.

Racing Bulls pilot Lawson appears to have set aside the drama from earlier in the season, claiming top 10s in 50% of his last four races. The New Zealander starts after a career-best sixth place at the Red Bull Ring.

Credit must also go to another rookie, Gabriel Bortoleto, who fought hard for his maiden F1 top 10 in the last round.

The MCL39 continues to outclass its rivals over one lap this season. Norris recorded the team's seventh pole position in the previous round, taking his tally to three.

Norris has started at the front of the grid in two of his past four races, while his Aussie team mate has qualified fastest in four rounds this year.
Meanwhile, Verstappen is a three-time fastest qualifier after 11 rounds, but enters after lining up in seventh in the Styrian Alps.

The Dutchman's fierce rival, Russell, is the only other driver to start on pole this season, proving consistent by qualifying among the fastest three in five rounds. The Briton's starting grid average sits at 4.45 this year, slightly below Verstappen's at 3.18.

Leclerc started in second in Austria, the third such grid position for the Monegasque this season. The previous round also marked the best Qualifying for Ferrari this year, with both drivers ending inside the top five for the first time.

German drivers and cars have won nine of the last 13 British Grands Prix.

Hamilton was the latest victor for Mercedes, but will now defend his title in a red Italian car. Verstappen, Sainz, and Sebastian Vettel are the only non-Mercedes drivers to prevail in England since 2013. That leaves Red Bull and Ferrari with two triumphs apiece in the last 12 years.

McLaren last won the Silverstone showcase in 2008, when a young Hamilton was on their payroll. The Woking-based outfit may have struggled on home soil for 16 years, but they are the team to beat this time around. After 11 rounds, the papayas have won 72.73% of the Teams' trophies on offer, including three in their last four outings.

Max Verstappen claimed an impressive pole position in Qualifying for the British Grand Prix, the Red Bull driver getting the better of the McLaren pair.

Max Verstappen has clinched pole position at the British Grand Prix, the Red Bull driver storming through with a stunning lap to put himself at the front of the grid ahead of the McLarens of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris.

While Piastri had secured provisional pole during the first runs of Q3, the Australian made a mistake on his final effort and could not improve. But Verstappen put his lap together perfectly to go fastest on an effort of 1m 24.892s, putting himself 0.103s clear of Piastri's McLaren.

The other papaya car of Lando Norris will start from third, the Briton also unable to better his previous time on his last flying lap. George Russell followed for Mercedes in fourth, while Lewis Hamilton wound up in fifth, despite the Ferrari driver being Piastri's closest challenger in the first runs.

Hamilton's team mate Charles Leclerc claimed sixth, with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli taking seventh ahead of Ollie Bearman in eighth, though the Haas driver will start near the back of the field thanks to a 10-place grid penalty for a red flag infringement in third practice.

Fernando Alonso put his Aston Martin in ninth place, while Pierre Gasly was an impressive 10th at the wheel of the Alpine.

Qualifying results

FORMULA 1 QATAR AIRWAYS BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2025

Williams had a disappointing day, with Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon both exiting Q2 in P11 and P14 respectively. It was also another tough outing for Yuki Tsunoda, who found himself down in P12 for Red Bull.

Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar took 13th place, with the Haas of Esteban Ocon the final car to miss out on the top 10 shootout in 15th.

There was drama in Q1 when Alpine's Franco Colapinto spun off into the barriers at the final corner, bringing out the red flags and leaving the Argentinian driver down in P20.

Also eliminated in the first segment of Qualifying – which saw the whole field barring Colapinto covered by just six-tenths – were Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson in 16th, the Kick Sauber duo of Gabriel Bortoleto and Nico Hulkenberg in 17th and 19th respectively and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll between them in 18th.

After three busy practice sessions – each featuring a different driver at the top of the timesheets – it was time for Saturday's highly-anticipated Qualifying session. Russell clinched pole at home in 2024, but who would put themselves at the front of the grid this time around?

Bortoleto was the first to hit the track as the green light signalled the start of Q1, the Kick Sauber team having repaired the car in time following the Brazilian's spin into the gravel during FP3. Conditions looked to be dry, but Gasly hinted at a change as he radioed in to report “some drizzle”.

As the rest of the pack started to emerge – all sporting the C4 soft tyres – Piastri went fastest during the early runs, his lap of 1m 26.002s putting him 0.039s clear of Verstappen in second and Alonso in third.

There was drama with just over eight minutes remaining as Colapinto had a moment at the final corner and spun into the barriers, bringing out the yellow flags. The Alpine driver initially got going again before then pulling off the track again near the pit exit, resulting in a red flag being thrown to allow for the Argentine's car to be recovered.

When the session resumed with six minutes and 49 seconds remaining, the drivers at risk were Bortoleto, Ocon, Hulkenberg, the stricken Colapinto and Gasly, with Tsunoda on the bubble in 15th place – while leader Piastri stated that the drops of rain seemed “worse than before”.

Albon improved to climb up to third, while Verstappen and Piastri swapped fastest laps at the top of the timesheets. Elsewhere Hamilton and Leclerc looked to potentially be at risk in P11 and P13, with Hamilton told that he did not have enough fuel remaining for another lap.

Leclerc went on to move himself up to ninth, while Hamilton was pushed to 14th but stayed out of the elimination zone and Sainz climbed to eighth. Others were not so lucky, however; Lawson exited in 16th, a contrast from his sixth place on the grid last time out in Austria.

The Kick Saubers of Bortoleto and Hulkenberg exited in P17 and P19 respectively, with Stroll sandwiched between them in P18 while the aforementioned Colapinto ended the segment in P20 following his accident. Colapinto aside, the entire field was covered by just six-tenths in an incredibly close Q1.

Knocked out: Lawson, Bortoleto, Stroll, Hulkenberg, Colapinto

After an initially quiet start, Verstappen led the field out as Q2 got underway at Silverstone. The Dutchman soon went fastest on a 1m 25.316s – before Piastri incredibly set the exact same time, going into P2 given that he set his time after Verstappen.

More was to come though from Norris, who beat both drivers by 0.085s to go to the top, a welcome sight to the fans watching on in his grandstand. Further back, Hamilton, Antonelli, Leclerc, Gasly and Tsunoda were the names at risk in the bottom five, all of whom had sported used tyres on their first runs.

Alonso, meanwhile, was left unimpressed after encountering a slow-moving Antonelli, the two-time World Champion calling the incident “crazy” before suggesting that the Italian – who already has a three-place grid drop from his Lap 1 crash in Austria – would receive a penalty.

As the segment entered its final minutes, everybody was back out on track in an effort to improve and get themselves into the top 10 shootout. The Scuderia cars bolted on fresh rubber for this run, enabling Leclerc to initially go fastest but Hamilton stormed to the head of the timesheets on a 1m 25.084s, just under five-hundredths clear of his team mate.

Despite moving up to 10th, Tsunoda found himself pushed down the order as others bettered their times, dropping the Red Bull driver down to 12th. Williams also faced disappointment as Sainz and Albon exited in 11th and 14th respectively, with a downbeat Albon reporting: “We made it difficult for ourselves.” Also out were Hadjar in P13 and Ocon in P15.

Knocked out: Sainz, Tsunoda, Hadjar, Albon, Ocon

After an action-packed build-up, attentions turned to the top 10 shootout at Silverstone, with the Ferrari, McLaren and Mercedes duos joined by Verstappen, Alonso, Gasly and Bearman, though the latter would drop down the order thanks to a 10-place grid penalty from a red flag infringement in FP3.

As the first laps went on the board, Piastri secured provisional pole position by pumping in a 1m 24.995s, while Hamilton proved to be his nearest challenger on a lap 0.135s adrift of the Australian. The other McLaren of Norris was third, with Verstappen and Leclerc following behind.

With the clock ticking down, the time arrived for the decisive final runs. Could Piastri hold on to score his fifth P1 grid slot of the year, or might Hamilton add a record eighth pole position at Silverstone to his name – and his first in general since the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix?

Piastri looked to be improving, but a mistake on his lap meant that the Australian could not better his previous lap. The likes of Norris, Hamilton and Leclerc were also unable to make improvements – but Verstappen put together a sublime lap to grab pole position, the Red Bull man going quickest thanks to his effort of 1m 24.892s.

This put him 0.103s clear of Piastri, while Norris had to settle for third. Russell moved up the order to take fourth, pushing Hamilton and Leclerc down to fifth and sixth respectively, while Antonelli claimed seventh, though the Italian will drop down three places after receiving a penalty last time out in Austria.

Bearman slotted into eighth but, like Antonelli, will not keep his original position owing to a grid drop, the Haas driver moving down 10 places. Alonso and Gasly, meanwhile, rounded out the top 10.

""It was tricky out there with the wind,"" said Verstappen. ""Throughout the whole of Qualifying it was shifting around a bit, and around here with these cars they are extremely sensitive to it. Just tried to tidy it up throughout Qualifying and that final lap was good enough. This is a proper track in Qualifying, where you have to go flat-out on all these corners, you have to be really committed and that's really enjoyable.""

The 2025 British Grand Prix is set to begin at 1500 local time on Sunday. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can catch the action from Silverstone.

2025 British Grand Prix: Norris crosses the line to take his first British Grand Prix victory

Lando Norris has won in front of his home crowd at the British Grand Prix, the McLaren man leading from team mate Oscar Piastri while Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg claimed a long-awaited podium in third.

Lando Norris has taken victory in an eventful wet-dry British Grand Prix, the McLaren driver leading home team mate Oscar Piastri on an action-packed afternoon that also saw Nico Hulkenberg finally clinch his maiden F1 podium.

With the race starting in dry conditions, polesitter Max Verstappen initially led away from Piastri – but the Australian soon got ahead just as rain started to fall heavily at Silverstone.

While the McLaren quickly built a strong lead, this was neutralised when the Safety Car was deployed, marking the first appearance for the vehicle during the event.

An action-packed event ensued from there, with Piastri receiving a 10-second time penalty for slowing too much when preparing to lead the pack away following another Safety Car restart, while a spin for Verstappen moments later saw the Dutchman drop backwards.

As conditions changed and drivers started to switch to slick tyres later on, Piastri served his penalty during his pit stop and Norris took over the lead of the race – and from there Norris maintained his advantage to seal the win in front of a cheering crowd, crossing the line 6.812s ahead of Piastri.

Behind them the big story came courtesy of Hulkenberg, the Kick Sauber driver remarkably climbing from P19 on the grid to claim his first podium in third place on his 239th Grand Prix start, having fended off a potential challenge from Lewis Hamilton to hold onto the dream result.

FORMULA 1 QATAR AIRWAYS BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2025

Hamilton had to settle for fourth in his first race at Silverstone as a Ferrari driver, while Verstappen recovered to fifth following his earlier spin in the Red Bull and Pierre Gasly claimed a solid sixth place for Alpine.

Aston Martin's Lance Stroll was seventh – having just lost out on sixth to Gasly in the final moments – with Alex Albon taking eighth for Williams. The other Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso crossed the line in ninth, while George Russell rounded out the top 10 for Mercedes.

Ollie Bearman just missed out on points at his home race, the Haas driver ending up in P11 ahead of Williams' Carlos Sainz in P12 and the other Haas of Esteban Ocon in P13, the Frenchman having made contact with team mate Bearman in the latter stages.

Charles Leclerc was 14th on a difficult day for the Ferrari man, having been one of those to gamble on swapping to slick tyres following the formation lap, while Yuki Tsunoda was the final driver classified in 15th for Red Bull.

Five drivers retired from the event, with Franco Colapinto the first to do so after stalling his Alpine in the pit lane.

Liam Lawson exited on Lap 1 following a collision with Ocon, the Racing Bulls driver having to pull off the track, while Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto was the next to record a DNF after a spin into the gravel.

Isack Hadjar suffered a heavy crash in the mixed conditions, though fortunately the Racing Bulls man reported that he was okay, and Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli became the final retiree following a tough afternoon for the Italian.

One day on from a thrilling Qualifying session – in which Verstappen stormed through to claim pole position ahead of the McLaren pair of Norris and Piastri – the attentions of the paddock had switched to the 52-lap British Grand Prix.

There had been two changes to the starting order following that session, with Antonelli moving from seventh to 10th thanks to a grid drop for his Lap 1 collision with Verstappen in Austria, while Bearman had taken a 10-place penalty due to a red flag infringement in third practice, meaning that he would line up in 18th.

Colapinto, meanwhile, was set to start from the pit lane, Alpine having made changes to his car under parc ferme conditions following his spin into the barriers during Q1 of Saturday's Qualifying.

Rain had been falling on and off at Silverstone in the hours prior to the race, leaving plenty of question marks over the forecast for the Grand Prix. While the intermittent showers looked to have abated as the start time neared, conditions remained damp and gusty when the cars started to line up on the grid.

Given the weather, it was confirmed that the formation lap would be started behind the Safety Car, while it was also revealed when the tyre blankets were removed that all 20 cars would start on fresh intermediate tyres. However, a number of cars – Russell, Leclerc, Antonelli, Hadjar and Bearman – dived into the pits to bolt on slick tyres prior to the start, leaving gaps on the grid.

Verstappen made a strong launch from pole, holding onto the lead ahead of Piastri and Norris, before Norris soon faced a challenge from a racy Hamilton. The Ferrari had to back out, allowing Gasly to get in on the action and close in on the seven-time World Champion.

There was drama further back for Lawson, who found himself out of the running following a collision with Ocon. With the Racing Bulls car pulling off the track, the Virtual Safety Car was deployed, while elsewhere Colapinto also retired early on after stalling in the pit lane.

Just as the VSC period was ending, Bortoleto became the next car to spin off into the gravel, though fortunately the Kick Sauber was able to get going again. There remained a piece of the Brazilian's front wing near the track, however, sparking a yellow flag.

Bortoleto subsequently stopped, meaning that another VSC was called on Lap 6 – which also brought a pause to an increasingly interesting battle at the front between Verstappen and Piastri, with the Australian having been closing the gap to the World Champion.

Behind them, Norris remained in third ahead of Hamilton, Gasly, Alonso, Sainz, Albon, Tsunoda and Hulkenberg. By Lap 7 the VSC had come to an end, allowing Piastri to recommence his chase of Verstappen, bringing the margin down to less than half a second.

After looking at making a move a few times, Piastri surged ahead of Verstappen just one tour later to take the lead of the race, sparking cheers from the crowd. Further back, Antonelli was tussling with Leclerc back down the order, the former having pitted under the first VSC for another set of hard tyres.

While Antonelli initially got ahead, Leclerc went on to retake the position – before Antonelli headed into the pits on Lap 10 to switch to intermediate tyres amid increasingly dark skies at Silverstone, rain seemingly on the way.

And soon the rainfall had indeed arrived, sparking several more pit stops as Verstappen tried to fend off Norris. Going side by side, Verstappen ran off the track which allowed Norris through before both dived into the pit lane.

McLaren double-stacked their drivers and it proved to be a slightly slow stop for Norris, meaning that Verstappen found himself ahead of the Briton as they re-emerged from the pits. By Lap 12, Piastri was still in the lead, with Albon running amongst the leaders having not yet pitted.

The Williams soon made a pit stop, allowing Verstappen to again run in second from Norris in third amid heavy spray being kicked up. In the increasingly tricky conditions, on Lap 14 the Safety Car was deployed, neutralising what had been a significant lead for Piastri.

Replays showed Leclerc having an off, the Monegasque reporting water in his visor as he bounced across the grass. Meanwhile, as the Safety Car continued to lead the pack around, Piastri led from Verstappen and Norris with Stroll an eye-catching fourth, the Canadian known to perform well in wet conditions.

The other Aston Martin of Alonso, however, was not quite so happy in P10. The Spaniard voiced his annoyance about his strategy, given that he had started P7 in comparison to Stroll in P17 – but would things change when the Safety Car came into the pits on Lap 17?

With plenty of spray still around, Piastri maintained his lead as racing recommenced – but the Safety Car was then called out again on Lap 18 after Hadjar crashed heavily, the Racing Bulls machine running into the rear of Antonelli.

Fortunately the Frenchman radioed in to report that he was okay, before admitting that he could not see the Mercedes. Antonelli, meanwhile, was able to continue on down in P15, with the incident set to be investigated after the race. The total number of cars left in the running was now down to 16.

Antonelli made his third pit stop of the afternoon on Lap 21, before the Safety Car period again came to an end later in the lap. Piastri was noted for a potential infringement, the Australian having seemingly slowed too much at the restart – leading to Verstappen briefly getting past. The Dutchman then dramatically spun as the race recommenced, dropping him down to P10.

By Lap 24, Piastri was leading by three seconds from Norris, with Stroll now in third ahead of Hulkenberg, Gasly, Hamilton, Russell, Alonso, Sainz and Verstappen. That soon changed when Hamilton went wide through Copse, allowing Russell to go through.

While Piastri remained in front, the Australian was handed a 10-second time penalty for slowing too much behind the Safety Car. The stewards were also kept busy as they prepared to investigate Tsunoda and Bearman for a collision at the restart, which sent Bearman into a spin, while Antonelli had also joined the list of retirements.

“You have a 17-second gap to Stroll – head down,” Piastri was informed by his race engineer upon being told of his penalty. Tsunoda, meanwhile, had been handed a 10-second time penalty of his own for causing a collision with Bearman.

Elsewhere, Hamilton was making moves after snatching P5 from Gasly, with Hulkenberg the next in the Briton's sights – but the German was in fighting mood himself, having closed to within a second of Stroll in the battle for third. Could the German achieve a long-awaited debut F1 podium?

While Hamilton had brought the gap down to 1.7s by Lap 34, Hulkenberg was now around half a second behind Stroll – and just one lap later, the Kick Sauber swept through to move up into third. This left Stroll at the mercy of Hamilton, the Ferrari man soon following through to take fourth.

Further back, with DRS having been enabled, Verstappen had taken P9 from Sainz, with Alonso some three seconds up the road from the Dutchman in P8. Up at the front, Piastri was leading Norris by two seconds.

“The track is pretty decent – it's starting to dry up a bit,” Hamilton reported when asked about the conditions, the Ferrari man suggesting that there would be a “crossover” in the laps ahead. Come Lap 38, Alonso became the first to make that switch, bolting on the medium tyres, while Russell was the next to stop for the hard compound.

The call did not initially look to be paying off for Alonso, the Aston Martin driver sliding around as he struggled for grip – before Russell had a spin through the gravel, the Mercedes man subsequently managing to return to the track.

After struggling to pass Hulkenberg, Hamilton pitted on Lap 42 for slicks, the World Champion returning to the track with soft tyres bolted on. A flurry of action saw several others make the call, with Stroll also opting for softs while Verstappen, Gasly, Sainz, Bearman and Tsunoda had gone for the mediums.

The next to make the move was Hulkenberg who pitted for the medium compound – and, with Hamilton having a wide moment, the German emerged back in third place. Piastri then made a stop on Lap 44, serving his penalty in the process which brought him back out in second.

Intra-team drama hit for Haas when contact occurred between Ocon and Bearman, with both making synchronised spins. Meanwhile Norris stopped for medium tyres before returning to the track ahead of his team mate – but an aggressive Piastri was chasing him down, running wide at one point as he tried to cut the gap.

Piastri radioed in to suggest that the team could consider swapping positions if they felt that his penalty was unfair – an idea that Norris would perhaps be less inclined to support. McLaren went on to state that they would not be making any team orders as the race entered into the final laps.

As the chequered flag fell, Norris crossed the line to take his first home victory and the eighth win of his F1 career, the Briton sparking cheers from the fans along the way. Piastri followed 6.812s down the road – and behind him, Hulkenberg claimed third to seal that long-awaited first podium.

Hamilton took fourth place after being unable to catch the Kick Sauber, with Verstappen ending up in fifth following his earlier spin. Gasly was still on the move until the very end, the Frenchman overtaking Stroll on the final lap to snatch sixth on an impressive afternoon for the Alpine driver.

With Stroll having to settle to seventh, Albon followed in eighth – the Thai driver breaking a string of consecutive DNFs – while Alonso and Russell rounded out the top 10.

Bearman took 11th place in his first home race as an F1 driver, ahead of Sainz in 12th and Ocon in 13th.  The Haas duo are amongst those set to visit the stewards following the Grand Prix regarding their collision in the latter stages.

Leclerc's difficult afternoon ended in 14th, while Tsunoda was the last classified runner in 15th place.

A total of five drivers did not make the finish, with Colapinto, Lawson, Bortoleto, Hadjar and Antonelli all failing to reach the end, with both Hadjar and Antonelli due to visit the stewards after the race over the contact that occurred between them.

Following the race, Norris is now just eight points behind Piastri in the championship standings, with Verstappen still in a more distant third.

“The last few laps I was just looking into the crowd,"" said race winner Norris. ""I was just trying got take it all in, enjoy the moment because it might never happen again. I hope it does but these are memories that I'll bring with me forever so – incredible achievement.”

After a couple of weekends off, F1 will return to Spa-Francorchamps for the Belgian Grand Prix on July 25-27. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

Alonso reacts to P9 finish - 'It feels like we lost an opportunity to score more points'

2025 British Grand Prix: Norris crosses the line to take his first British Grand Prix victory

As many as half a dozen cars have the pace to challenge for victory in the British Grand Prix, according to George Russell.

George Russell has admitted that he “would have definitely taken” fourth on the grid for Sunday's British Grand Prix when heading into Qualifying, after his and the team's difficult start to the weekend.

Russell and Mercedes were off the pace across Friday's pair of practice sessions in pleasant, warm conditions at Silverstone, but returned to the sharp end when temperatures cooled on Saturday.

A stellar last Qualifying lap saw Russell come away with a second-row grid slot, behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen and the two McLaren drivers, and just ahead of Ferrari duo Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc – 0.229s covering that top-six group.

Asked to reflect on Qualifying, Russell said: “It was an amazing final lap. Every lap today we were… every lap this whole weekend we've been about five-tenths, six-tenths off the pace, sometimes even eight-tenths off the pace.

“Getting through Q1 and Q2 was a struggle, and then to finish my last lap only a tenth off pole, 20 milliseconds from the front row, I mean, yeah, I would have definitely taken it!”

With similar conditions expected on race day, Russell feels he is firmly in the mix for a podium on home soil, if not more – but reckons there could be half a dozen cars vying for the big prize.

“I think we can definitely push for a podium,” he continued. “Obviously the conditions are favourable, but it's taken us from being off the pace to sort of being there or thereabouts – it hasn't sort of propelled us to the front.

“I think it's probably fair to say that we overachieved a little bit today, especially in terms of the gaps, we definitely overachieved. Ferrari obviously struggled on that last lap. Tomorrow's probably going to be a six-way fight.”

As for Russell's team mate, Kimi Antonelli, the Italian was some three-tenths slower en route to seventh position – but he will drop three places on Sunday due to the penalty he picked up for clashing with Max Verstappen in Austria.

“It was quite tight out there,” he said of Qualifying. “I've been struggling a little bit in the high speed, just struggling to feel the stability and it just killed a bit the confidence, to be honest, throughout the session.

“Not easy, but obviously tomorrow with the penalty we'll try to do our best from there and build from there.”

Pushed on what's still possible, Antonelli added: “Well, hopefully the race pace is going to be good. It's not going to be easy because it's pretty tight, but I think if we have a good start and play it smart then we can try to set a good pace and move forward.”

Campos Racing's Mari Boya stood on the top step in an FIA Formula 3 Feature Race for the first time on Sunday at Silverstone.

Campos Racing's Mari Boya stood on the top step in an FIA Formula 3 Feature Race for the first time on Sunday, winning in torrential conditions in the Feature Race.

The Spaniard got the tyre strategy call right ahead of lights out as pre-race rain left teams and drivers split between wet and dry tyres.

Boya used the wets to good effect, going from sixth on the grid into the lead on the opening lap. He controlled things from the front afterwards, before a Red Flag ended the race after 14 of the scheduled 22 laps, as heavier rain began to hit the Silverstone track.

Behind him, Théophile Nael of Van Amersfoort Racing took second place ahead of PREMA Racing's Noel León in third position.

Having started from pole position, Nikola Tsolov had opted for slicks along with P2 starter Ugo Ugochukwu and Championship leader Rafael Câmara, who went from third.

All three tumbled down the order on the opening lap, and eventually finished outside of the points in 20th, 21st and 22nd respectively.

F1 Hall of Fame journalist David Tremayne looks back at a triumph that no one expected, but that was richly deserved after Johnny Herbert had been battered and cheated by fate.

I guess it was on Lap 51 of the 1995 British GP at Silverstone that the penny finally began to drop. There'd been a false dawn five laps earlier, but now it looked like it really was going to happen.

Johnny Herbert – ‘The Imp' as Perry McCarthy had christened him in F3 – was actually going to win a Grand Prix... and on his home ground to boot.

Winning at home is the greatest buzz. Just ask Lewis Hamilton, or Nigel Mansell.

Leonardo Fornaroli converted pole position into an impressive maiden Formula 2 victory at the Silverstone Sprint Race.

The Invicta Racing driver lost the lead at the start to Kush Maini, but pulled off an impressive overtake on the run down to Copse corner to retake the position on Lap 1.

From then on, Fornaroli went off into the distance, crossing the line to claim his first win of the season, and a victory on home soil for his Invicta team.

PREMA Racing's Sebastián Montoya fought through from sixth on the grid to finish second, while Roman Stanek made it a double podium for Invicta by taking P3.

Alpine Academy driver Maini had done his best to hold on to a spot on the podium, but lost out to Stanek on the penultimate lap, before ending up in fourth place.

AIX Racing's Joshua Duerksen held off Maini's DAMS Lucas Oil teammate Jak Crawford across the line by a thousandth to finish in fifth.

A post-race penalty for causing a collision with fellow Williams Driver Academy member Victor Martins on the final lap caused Hitech TGR's Luke Browning to drop from seventh to 12th in the final classification.

This promoted Championship leader Richard Verschoor up to seventh for MP Motorsport, with ART Grand Prix driver Martins taking the last point in P8.

Martins is also set to start from pole position in Sunday's Feature Race, where he will be joined on the front row by Rodin Motorsport's Alexander Dunne.

The seventh installment in the action-adventure series created by Steven Spielberg opened well ahead of expectations over the long Fourth of July holiday in the U.S. — where it racked up $147.3 million — as well as overseas. 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The dinos have a new lease on life.


	Universal and Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth came in well ahead of expectations at the Fourth of July box office to hatch a new era for the Steven Spielberg-created franchise. In North America, the holiday tentpole is reporting an estimated five-day domestic opening of $147.3 million, including $91.5 million for the three-day weekend. (Estimates have been revised upwards every day since the pic hit the big screen midweek on July 2.)




Jurassic World Rebirth, the seventh title in the series, is roaring even louder overseas, where it opened to an estimated $171 million from more than 80 markets. That puts the film's global start at $318.3 million — the second-best launch of the franchise, and the biggest worldwide opening of the year to date, after passing up A Minecraft Movie. No one saw that coming.

	Internationally, Rebirth scored the second-best international opening of the year and of the franchise. It even bit off a big number in China, where Hollywood tentpoles can no longer depend upon big grosses. The dino franchise, like the Mission: Impossible films, is an exception. Rebirth debuted to $41.5 million to score the biggest opening of the year so far for a Hollywood title. And it already ranks as the second-biggest Hollywood pic of the year behind Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning. Other top markets included the U.K. ($16.6 million) and Mexico ($14 million).


	In North America, Rebirth ranks as the fourth-best showing ever for the July Fourth holiday, both in terms of the five-day and three-day number. That's no small feat considering July 4 fell on a Friday this year, meaning many moviegoers were distracted by holiday outings on what's normally a critical day for new films.

	











	To boot, the latest Jurassic World pic has received decidedly mixed reviews from both critics and audiences alike (one example: it earned a meh B CinemaScore from moviegoers). But there's no dismissing the power of the Jurassic brand, or the spectacle of seeing dinosaurs come to life on the big screen. “It's the definition of a popcorn movie,” is one common refrain making the rounds in Hollywood. Another? “It's dumb fun.”


	Heading into the holiday, the pic was eyeing a far more modest domestic opening in the $100 to $120 million range and $260 million globally, considering it was a reboot and the seventh installment in a series more than 30 years old.


	Following the conclusion of the Jurassic World trilogy directed by Colin Trevorrow, Spielberg, Amblin and Universal, they went back to the drawing board and enlisted filmmaker Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) to direct Rebirth from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp.


	The film features an all-new cast anchored by Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali and Jonathan Bailey. The story follows an extraction team that races to an island research facility that factored into the original Jurassic Park (along the way, they discover a shipwrecked family). Now, the island is inhabited by the worst of the worst creatures that were left behind.Rupert Friend, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Luna Blaise, David Iacono and Audrina Miranda also star. Producers include longtime franchise stewards Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, with Spielberg and Denis Stewart exec producing.


	The first three Jurassic World pics all grossed north of $1 billion globally, and all opened higher than Rebirth domestically (comparisons are complicated by the fact that those were all there-day, non-holiday openings). In 2015, Jurassic World opened to a franchise-best $208.8 million, followed by $148 million for 2018's Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and $145 million for 2022's Jurassic World: Dominion, not adjusted for inflation. At the same time, the latest film cost less to produce, or a net $180 million before marketing.

	











	The first Jurassic Park, directed by Spielberg, opened to $47 million domestically in early June 1993, not adjusted for inflation — a huge sum at the time.


	Also setting off fireworks at the box office was Brad Pitt's F1: The Movie, which has already earned nearly $300 million globally, including a 10-day domestic tally of $109.5 million. 


	From Apple Original Films in partnership with Warner Bros., F1 came in second over the holiday weekend with an estimated three-day gross of $26.1 million. Overseas, it racked up another $56.3 million for a foreign cume of $184.1 million and $293.6 million globally.


	The movie, reteaming Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer, is a critical and audience darling and fell just 54 percent in its second outing. The film is enjoying a major boost from having a lock on Imax screens for three weekends. 


	Universal was a double winner at the holiday box office as DreamWorks Animation's live-action How to Train Your Dragon came in third place with an estimated $11 million for a domestic tally of $224 million. Globally, it set off fireworks in clearing the $500 million milestone after amassing a foreign haul of $292.9 million. 


	Pixar and Disney's troubled pic Elio came in fourth with an estimated $5.7 million for a muted domestic tally of $55.1 million. Overseas, it earned another $6.7 million for a foreign tally of $41.7 million and $96.8 million globally.

	











	Danny Boyle and Sony's 28 Years Later rounded out the top five domestically with $4.6 million for a domestic haul of $60.2 million. The sequel grossed another $7 million at the international box office for a foreign total of $65.6 million and $125.8 million globally.


Blumhouse and Atomic Monster's ill-fated M3GAN 2.0 fell off somewhat less than expected, or 62 percent, in its second weekend to an estimated $3.8 million after bombing in its debut a week ago. The Universal releases tied for sixth place with Disney's live-action Lilo & Stitch, which is likewise reporting a three-day gross of $3.8 million.


Lilo & Stitch made major headlines in passing up A Minecraft Movie to become the top-earning pic of 2025 at the worldwide box office after finishing Sunday with a global total of $972.7 million. It remains to be seen whether the Memorial Day release can become the first Hollywood title of the year to join the billion-dollar club. 


	Elsewhere on the top 10 chart, fellow Memorial Day release Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning finished Sunday with a global haul of $576.2 million.

At the Karlovy Vary film fest, the star also discusses measuring success in ways other than box office and how her TeaTime Pictures tells female-centric stories that are ""provocative"" and ""different.""


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Dakota Johnson (Fifty Shades of Grey, Black Mess, Suspiria) is likely to direct her first feature based on a script by an autistic actress she has acted with in a film, wants to continue telling female-centric stories through her TeaTime Pictures, avoid “toxic sets,” measure the success of movies in terms of viewer impact rather than box office and would love to play a psychopath and an action role, the actress said on Sunday.


	Asked by reporters during a press roundtable at the 59th edition of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (KVIFF) in the Czech Republic about whether she will move beyond acting and producing into directing, Johnson replied: “I think I will direct a feature, a very small one, hopefully soon. And it's really close to my heart and very close to TeaTime. We're making it with Vanessa Burghardt, who played my daughter in Cha Cha Real Smooth. She's an incredible autistic actress.”

	The star shared: “I've always felt that I'm not ready to direct a feature. I don't have the confidence. But with her, I feel very protective, and I know her very well, and … I just won't let anybody else do it.”

	As a director, Johnson has already made the Coldplay music video “Cry Cry Cry” and the short film Loser Baby.


	What attracts her interest when picking TeaTime projects? “Usually, it's something that is either visually or emotionally provocative. And I don't mean that in a sexual way. I mean it in [the sense] that it provokes something that is different than what you see on TV right now or on streaming platforms. A lot of them are also female characters. So it's female-centric films where the woman is different from what you see, and complex and nuanced, and maybe an anti-hero that you love.” Projects could even feature a woman “who maybe does things that you would deem atrocious, but you are really on her side because she's angry” and real, Johnson explained.

	











	Producing has the benefit that she can surround herself with people who create a positive work experience. “I can't waste time on toxic sets anymore,” Johnson said. “With producing, that's one of the perks.” 


	She told reporters that she was “pretty vocal” when issues arose on set or beyond from a very young age. “Now, … being a producer and developing my own films, I can choose all the people.”


	The star also called for new ways to measure the success of movies. “I think that the barometer for that is shifting right now. It's hard to measure success based on box office numbers now, because it's so all over the place,” she offered. Mentioning that Jurassic Park Rebirth has “slayed,” she said that, “the way I measure success is [in terms of] people who felt something or it meant something to them” — or people coming up to her in the street and telling her that they loved a film.


	Johnson made time for meeting the press before receiving the KVIFF President's Award on Saturday evening before a screening of her new film Materialists, which was directed by Celine Song and also stars Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans.


	The second film that Johnson presented at KVIFF is the Michael Angelo Covino-directed romantic comedy Splitsville, which she also produced under her TeaTime Pictures banner, launched in 2019 with her producing partner Ro Donnelly.


	Are there any types of characters she'd love to take on in the future? “There are roles that I dream of playing,” Johnson shared. “I would love to play a psychopath, would love to do an action film.”

	











	Johnson also shared that “I love coming to film festivals, just because everyone loves movies so much, and it feels like a magical little bubble in a world full of chaos and pain.” She added: “I think art can really reach people, and so, … festivals in places like this make me feel inspired and hopeful.”


	Concluded Johnson: “It's really hard to make movies right now and to get people to believe in what you want to say. I don't think movies will save the world, by no means, but I do think it's nice to have them around.”


	Johnson made her film debut at age 10 in Antonio Banderas' 1999 movie Crazy in Alabama. In 2010, she appeared in David Fincher's The Social Network. Her recent credits have included the likes of Maggie Gyllenhaal's The Lost Daughter (2021) and Carrie Cracknell's Persuasion (2022). She next stars in Amazon's Michael Showalter-directed romance thriller Verity, opposite Anne Hathaway and Josh Hartnett.


	“Dakota Johnson continues her family's multigenerational acting tradition, as represented by her grandmother Tippy Hedren and both of her parents, award-winning Hollywood stars Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson,” festival organizers had highlighted when they unveiled that she would visit the picturesque Czech spa town to receive the honor.

“I'm excited to meet them one day, it'll be great when we can all get in a room together,” Corenswet said of the two actors who have previously portrayed the iconic superhero.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	Former Supermen Henry Cavill and Tyler Hoechlin showed support for David Corenswet as he took on the renowned role in James Gunn's new Superman, but the two actors were reluctant to give him any explicit advice on how to tackle the part. 


	At the London premiere of the DC Studios film, the actor revealed in an interview with Heart that he'd spoken with both Cavill and Hoechlin, but both of the former Superman stars didn't give him “any tips” on how to approach his film. 




	“I had the pleasure of exchanging letters with two previous Supermans, Henry Cavill and Tyler Hoechlin. Both of them, interestingly, sort of said in their own words, ‘I'm not gonna try to give you any tips,'” he said, via Beat 102 103. “And I think that's a very Superman thing — Superman's not so much for giving advice or dictating how other people should be.”

	While both actors were reluctant to give Corenswet specific suggestions on how to best portray the Man of Steel, they did send him encouragement. 


	“They really just conveyed to me an encouragement and a sense of, you know, have fun with it, which I think is Superman's way of doing it too,” he explained. “They were very encouraging and we had a lovely exchange.” 


	The Twisters actor added that while he hasn't met with Cavill and Hoechlin face-to-face quite yet, “I'm excited to meet them one day, it'll be great when we can all get in a room together.” 


	Gunn's Superman will hit theaters on July 11, serving as the first time Corenswet will portray the iconic superhero. Cavill starred as Clark Kent in Zack Snyder's 2013 Man of Steel, 2016's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and 2017's Justice League, while Hoechlin starred as the character in the CW's TV series Superman & Lois from 2021 to 2024.

	











	Of choosing Corenswet to lead his Superman film, Gunn said that he had a great chemistry test with Rachel Brosnahan, who is set to star as Lois Lane. He explained, “David had better chemistry with Rachel [Brosnahan] because she's a very controlled actor, and David is a little bit more, you know, loose, and that creates a different type of dynamism on-screen.”

Rahul Purini also spoke about the company's co-production strategy and what challenges remain for bringing anime to Western audiences: ""That discovery piece is the biggest thing.""


							By 

	Abbey White


Associate Editor & News Writer


	Enter the buzzing showfloor at this year's Anime Expo, and you'll be met with the towering exhibitor presences of MAPPA, SEGA, Netflix, TOHO Animation, HULU, Viz Media, Aniplex, and more major players in a rapidly popularizing (and globalizing) anime industry. But even among the industry's recognizable players, Crunchyroll — and its series of showfloor experiences, merchandising, and photo-ops — calls back to the heyday of the convention circuit in a way few others do. 


	The massive booth features a mass of large screens that deliver trailer takeovers and anime ambiance sequences that act as an environmental backdrop alongside an “Anime Forecast,” a series on interactive screens where fans can browse the company's catalog of upcoming titles. There's of course a merch store to pick up collectables, manga, vinyls, clothing, and more, but there's also the “trash to treasure” dumpster dive experience that introduces you to the characters and story of its upcoming graffiti-infused anime Gachiakuta as well as the Demon Slayer – Infinity Castle activation setting up the film trilogy's release.

	Inside, attendees move through an immersive set deco recreation of the Infinity Castle before interacting with a motion sensor experience that soars through the alternate dimension via the Crow, and a 3D photo-op that uses swords to simulate the breathing techniques (Water, Flame, Wind, Stone and Thunder) of key characters. This immersive activation helps make Crunchyroll's floor presence one of the Expo's biggest and most technologically advanced booths, and it's every bit a part of the company's strategy, says president Rahul Purini.

	Like the day-long pop-up convention hub Crunchyroll Stage and the Crunchyroll Lounge where onsite deals are made, the booth is a must-have — even if some of Crunchyroll's competitors have pulled back in certain corners of the convention circuit after launching their own events. “Fans love experiences, and this [booth], that's what we are creating here. It's not just some of our store. It is a small amusement park. You can go interact with the characters, or touch the stories and find yourself immersed in that. And we're trying to do that in places where the fans are already gathered,” he explains. 


	Crunchyroll's ongoing lean into the fan space doesn't stop at the showfloor. Across the July 4 holiday weekend, the media and entertainment company featured a number of panels and screenings, and on Saturday, shared a steady stream of acquisition and trailer announcements. Among them, exclusive footage of Studio KAI's dark fantasy Sentenced to Be a Hero, which sees criminals sentenced to heroism/service in a penal military unit waging war against a demon king's army, and the news that Studio Pierrot's Black Clover will return for an all-new season only on Crunchyroll, alongside a teaser trailer, key visual, a message from the manga's creator Yuki Tabata celebrating the anime's return and manga's 10th anniversary. 


	Other news included a trailer for the newly announced anime adaptation of Daemons of the Shadow Realm based on a manga created by Hiromu Arakawa (Fullmetal Alchemist); confirmation of Re:ZERO – Starting Life in Another World season four streaming exclusively on Crunchyroll in 2026; and a two-minute first-look at the upcoming third season of Studio Bind's Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation; the October 2025 premiere of action comedy Tojima Wants to Be a Kamen Rider and January 2026 drop of romantic comedy You and I Are Polar Opposites. Classroom of the Elite fans will get a follow-up to season three, titled Classroom of the Elite 2nd Year, and the game Classroom of the Elite – Merge Puzzle Special Exam, playable for the first time outside of Japan via Crunchyroll's Game Vault, with Hiroyuki SAWANO LIVE [nZk]008 set to join Crunchyroll's library of over 100 full-length concerts later this summer.

	











	Ahead of Saturday's panel, The Hollywood Reporter spoke to Purini about the company's presence at the con and its current season, what he's most excited about in this moment of anime expansion, what challenges remain for those bringing the medium to western audiences, and key growth areas for the company. 


You've brought so much to the convention this weekend. What are you most excited about in terms of your slate? 


	Our July season is among one of the biggest seasons that we've ever had. The volume, the breadth and the depth of content that we are able to bring to fans around the world, and the diversity of the content, is one thing we're really excited about. There are shows for every kind of anime fan. There's a show that premiered over the weekend, Lord of Mysteries, which is a Chinese animation show — there's not a lot of that. But the biggest anime show in Japan, Gachiakuta, which we are featuring here, is a show that I'm really excited about. It is from our partners at [Japanese publisher] Kodansha, and it is one of those shows where, if you watch the trailer, you're hooked. This kind of breadth and depth of show not only makes this season really, really compelling, it also talks to where we Crunchyroll are as a company. We have the single largest library of anime content anywhere. We have something for every fan, every genre, and we are adding a ton every quarter. That speaks to the value proposition for the anime fan when they come to Crunchyroll.

	











You worked at Funimation before heading up Crunchyroll, so you understand what the lift of making anime accessible to U.S. audiences was in those early days before places like Hulu and Netflix were also doing it. What was the biggest challenge then and what's the biggest challenge now in terms of bringing this content to audiences? 


	Early on, the biggest challenge Crunchyroll and other companies that were serving this fan base solved was accessibility. There was anime fandom around the world, but it was hard to get your hands on it, even as your peers in Japan were watching and enjoying it [sooner]. That was the biggest thing that most companies, including Crunchyroll and Funimation, solved. When the shows are happening in Japan, bring them globally, subtitle them so it becomes accessible. In the case of Funimation, innovate to even dub it during the season. We call it the simuldub, where now dubs are available one episode at a time within two to four weeks. But those were the initial challenges: accessibility, getting the shows from Japan and making them available to fans so they weren't waiting for 15 to 18 months for a DVD release or for some TV channel to pick up a show. 


	The challenges now are somewhat similar, except it's a global audience. The audience is growing, and when the audience is growing, you need a diverse slate of content to serve that audience. So making sure we have that diverse slate for the audience that's global, and making it accessible to them — that we're on all the devices that they want to watch, we have all the payments that they want to use to sign up for it, all the languages that they want to watch it in whether it's subtitled or dubbed, and making it available when they want to watch it. The second part of that is, given the volume of content, how do we make sure that we find the right content for the right fan at the right time. That discovery piece is the biggest thing that we are trying to solve because there's so much new content. How do we make fans aware of what's available, and serve as that connection. 

	











Platforms and streamers who more recently entered the anime market have increasingly found ways to blend it with Western animation or use American audience influences a little more in the visuals and storytelling. Can you talk about how your approach to your content slate is different, and how you tap into this medium that is outside the realm of Western storytelling to deliver for audiences? 


	There are a few things that are really core to us, what we call our guiding principles. We believe anime is intrinsically connected back to Japan. For anime to be authentically anime, it has to be conceived and created by Japan, and we take that to heart. There is other animation that might be anime-inspired, but it's not anime unless it has the connection. Second is that anime is a medium. It's not a genre. There is anime for various kinds of people — there's action, romance, slice-of-life, sci-fi, fantasy. It's an art form, and that's important to understand. One of the ways that I think we have operated and we believe we can successfully serve the anime fan is being singularly focused on that. This is not one genre that we serve the fan. This is our entire existence. So that focus and that clarity of what is authentically anime, and that relationship with partners, that relationship with the fans, and understanding why fans connect with anime, all of those things allow us to be able to serve those creators and fans in the best way. 


Crunchryoll is now many things, but first it was largely a content library. Many streamers started that way as well, and then expanded. Where is Crunchyroll in that conversation? How much do you want original content? How do you want to do it?












	First, we do not consider ourselves to be a streamer. We consider ourselves to be a media and entertainment company focused on serving the anime fan. The video content is a big part of that fandom but this is much bigger than that. It's everything from the real-world experiences, the community, the connection, the games, the merchandise, the manga, the music. We're not interested in being something for everyone. We want to be everything for someone. So that's number one. In terms of how we think about content, I go back to the amazing storytellers and partners in Japan. We want to work with them all, we want all of their content to be available to consumers, and we will continue to do that. Having said that, the audience around the globe is expanding. To serve them, we need more funding and more diverse content. So we're doing co-productions, where we go to Japanese partners and help them fund shows by investing in them. This is not distributing, not licensing. We're actually part of the production committee that's making these shows. 


	In addition to that, when we find stories around the world that we think are going to be great, we're now starting to take the stories back to the Japanese creators and are asking if they're interested in making anime from this story. Ghost of Tsushima  [based on the Sony PlayStation game] is a great example. Solo Leveling is a great example. We took this Korean [title based on the web novel-turned-webtoon], and went back to Japan and said we would love to make an anime. And we got partners like Aniplex and A-1 Pictures excited about it. That's the third piece. Licensed content will always be the majority of our content because there's so many great Japanese viewers. We will co-produce content with our Japanese partners to invest and bring shows. But we will also commission shows because we have stories that we think will be great in anime, and we're taking them back to Japan. 

	











Anime has done some interesting things as it relates to theatrical releases, an area Hollywood has really been having a conversation about the last few years. The recent Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye experience, which put the first three episodes of season two together and screened them like a movie, is one example. Is there anything you think Hollywood can learn about the theatrical space from the anime industry in this current moment?


	I'm not sure we're at a place where we can tell Hollywood what it can learn. They've been doing this for a long time. (Laughs) What we have found and learned is that fans like experiences. They want to be able to go sit in a dark theater with friends and family and experience their stories on a big screen and feel that sense of community. So for them, it doesn't matter if it's a 90-minute or 120-minute movie, or it's three episodes put together. To them, it is great stories told in an amazing, creative way on a big screen. That is an interesting insight for us.


What are other growth areas you're focusing on right now that are represented at AX? 


	Games. About 18 months ago, we announced this initiative called Crunchyroll Game Vault. If you're a subscriber of Crunchyroll's higher tiers — mega or ultimate tier — you get access to games for free. We initially started with a handful of games, and now we've scaled that to over 60 that fans and subscribers have access to, to play for free. We're seeing a lot of traction. Fans come in to play a game and then watch something, and we are seeing a lot of subscribers that have been members for years dive in and play games telling us that they want to upgrade to be able to get access to the games. That is an area where we are really excited because there's a big overlap between gamers and anime fans. 

	











	And we recently announced that we're going to be bringing a digital manga app to our fans in the U.S. One of the things that fans ask us most is for access to manga, so we see a lot of opportunity to be able to serve fans through it. And obviously, merchandise. Fans are collectors. They want to show off their fandom, and we want to be able to bring these unique collector items — whether it is apparel, figures, home accessories — that they can buy. Another area that we see is theatrical. Demon Slayer is coming up, we are part of Sony Pictures and they've been bringing movies to the world for 100-plus years. So we're really excited about being able to bring movies to fans who want to watch in theaters. We know fans love that. 


You mentioned experiences and the exhibitor booth is one giant experience. Why is this such an important corner for Crunchyrull to occupy and are you thinking about ways to go bigger? 


	We're very fan-centric, very fan-first in our thinking. The fan sits at the center of everything we do. So we are here to serve this fanbase, and the best way for us to do that is to understand what they want, talk to them, connect with them, build a relationship with them. We don't know any other way to do this. Our teams put on 100-plus shows worldwide. This is not a few things a year that we do. We are constantly spending time with our fans. In terms of experiences, do we want to do something bigger? Yes, if the opportunity shows up the right way and we can create that authentic experience for fans, we will do that. We're doing that with videos. We're doing that with music festivals. At San Diego Comic-Con, we're going to have an anime music festival. Do we have a ride at a theme park? No. But are we creating experiences that excite? Absolutely.

If you wonder why this weekend's British Grand Prix and other races are loved by their fans, don't look to NASCAR — look to 'Real Housewives.'


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	Over the past few months, with the Brad Pitt movie F1 approaching and then overtaking the box office (it  just passed $100 million in only its second weekend of release) we longtime fans of the sport have found ourselves trying to explain the appeal to some of our F1-skeptical fellow Americans. 


	What is it that makes you so enthused, they ask. Is it the exotic locales? The death-defying speeds? The high-end branding? The machine fetishization?




			Related Video		







	All of these factors compel a little bit, of course. But the real secret to why Formula One fans devour the sport, as we will again when the British Grand Prix at Silverstone motors off on Sunday, is much sneakier: it's reality television.

	I don't mean that in the metaphoric sense of “it has excitement the way reality television has excitement.” Or, “it's unscripted the way reality television is (pretends to be) unscripted.” I mean that in a far more literal way. All the conventions, all the conceits, that makes us love Real Housewives or Love Is Blind or The Traitors play out on F1's perpetual multi-screen drama.


	The 24 Grand Prixes that happen around the world every few weeks are the new episodes, of course. But the true sizzle happens before and after races, when various drivers and team principals (they're the coaches) offer provocative disses about other teams, try to sign drivers from other teams, explain why they weren't trying to send the other teams into a wall at 220 m.p.h. Such out-of-competition drama is the kind of thing that doesn't happen in other sports —  or if it does, it happens as a one-off, not as a regular event and certainly not as a main selling point.

	











	The best analogy I can really come up with is wrestling, with its subplots and subtexts that exist well outside the ring. Of course, all that is plotted out. F1 offers the drama of Gunther and Sami Zayn going at it, except no one here is handing out any scripts.


	Consider the ongoing saga between Christian Horner, team principal at Red Bull, and various other team principals, like Mercedes' Toto Wolff and McLaren's Zak Brown.


	Horner doesn't much like Brown. You know this because Horner has called Brown a “prick.” Wolff doesn't like Horner, which you know because Wolff called him “petty and childish” after Horner filed an appeal following the Canadian Grand Prix last month, which itself followed Mercedes driver George Russell trying to bait Red Bull's Max Verstappen into a suspension-worthy on-course penalty late in the race, which itself followed Verstappen allegedly threatening to crash into Russell in Qatar last year, which itself followed… You get the idea. Bayleigh and Tyler from Big Brother would be proud.


	(How many F1 fans there are in the U.S. is hard to know, but the number is growing. Some three million people watched last year's Miami Grand Prix, the most ever Americans who tuned in. Formula One, for what it's worth, counts 45 million Americans in its “fanbase,” and says half of them began tuning in within the last five years. Netflix's pandemic-era hit Drive to Survive of course played a big role, but its numbers have been dropping. The Pitt movie aims to turbocharge them.)

	











	The drama will continue Sunday, as all-timer Lewis Hamilton will try to notch his first GP win since he shockingly announced early last season he was leaving Mercedes for Ferrari —  a Kristen-sleeping-with-Jax-and-screwing Stassi-level betrayal to some. Hamilton has won more F1 races than any driver in history, and won Silverstone nine times. But he's starting fifth and is a decided underdog Sunday. (Hamilton's drama this season has been with his team principal, whom he sarcastically told to “take a tea break while you're at it” mid-race when the principal didn't answer quickly enough on whether he would order teammate Charles LeClerc to let Hamilton pass.)


	Anyone who's binged Drive to Survive quickly grasps F1's Bachelor-y pleasures. The show gleefully accentuates reality-television moments, between and within teams. Watch in season one as Horner (the Tamra of the series) fights with leaders of his then-engine supplier Renault. Or in season seven, when McLaren's Brown asks one of his two drivers, the champion Lando Norris, to slow down and let his teammate Oscar Piastri pass so he can win the Hungarian Grand Prix — a kind of outrageous request that is like, well I can't even think of anything else it's like in other sports. When the Netflix camera does an abrupt zoom-in on Norris as he's talking to his friend about the controversy afterward you can almost feel the 30 Rock Queen of Jordan vibes.


	But the truth is for all the ways Netflix has leaned in to (or, as some have charged, contrived) these moments, producers really were just picking up on what was already there. Formula One has always been driven by the pistons of reality television, amazingly many years before the genre was even invented. More than a decade ahead of Kimmi and Alicia fighting on Survivor season two, the F1 legends Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna were fighting in multiple F1 seasons in a way that would make Jeff Probst blush.

	











	“He's behaving like a coward,” Senna would say about Prost. “It's become absolutely impossible to work with Ayrton,” Prost would say about Senna. (They were actually teammates in the late 1980's with McLaren, which only seemed to make their rivalry worse.)


	Fans of the 2013 Ron Howard movie Rush know that even this OG square-off was preceded by plenty of backbiting between the playboy Brit James Hunt and the buttoned-up Austrian Niki Lauda a decade earlier who, even more than Senna and Prost, had wildly different personalities and driving styles. 


	At least those drivers shared a grudging respect. A few years ago, when the young Huntian Brit George Russell ran the Laudian Finn Valtteri Bottas off the road at the Imola Grand Prix in a brutal crash, the two drivers came together… not to check on each other, but for Bottas to give Russell the finger and Russell to smack him on the helmet. On-course. Mid-race. This is Real Housewives with motor oil.


	Like reality television, part of the reason for the combustibility is the fitting of so many egos in a tight space. Literally, with some of the narrow passes on various courses. But also figuratively. All F1 teams have exactly two drivers, which means that there is really only room for one top competitor between the two egos — the kind of math that makes for mayhem. Nearly all other sports lack such a dynamic; they're either team games or lone endeavors. 


	Even structurally, F1 teammates are not really that, as while they compete against all the other teams for an end-of-season team championship known as the “constructor's” they're also competing within the team for podiums and points that count toward the end-of-year “driver's championship” and its chance for an athlete to either solidify their seat or attract the attention of another team with a better offer. Two teammates with a common goal but also radically individual incentive structures? Mark Burnett couldn't script it any better.

	











	That's why F1 the movie is such a Hollywood natural it can almost seem crazy it took this long to produce. The film's battle between Sonny and JP —  They're teammates! They're rivals! They're both at different times! They're both at the same time! —  isn't the kind of thing you even need Jerry Bruckheimer to gin up. It's already happening at half the Formula One teams as we speak. 


	Fans have dissected the movie like a pit crew poring over a damaged front wing, and there are indeed liberties taken —  a 60-year-old ain't holding their own in many F1 races; these are in-their-prime peak-condition athletes. But if anything, Kosinski and Pitt are playing down the intramural drama.


	Thinking about the reality-TV appeal of F1, I recalled the cultural critic Laura Miller's line that about The Sopranos. The David Chase show proved, she said, “that if you add enough violence men will watch a soap.” Only here swap in tire-strategy and screaming speeds for violence (but sometimes also violence). 


	Of course, many women watch F1 too —  according to its chief executive Stefano Domenicali, they compose 40 percent of the current fan base.The truth is most of us, no matter our gender, enjoy witnessing a good personality clash. When it involves spoiled millionaires acting like jackasses, we like it even more. And we straight-up love it when said millionaires are gunning around a track with the abiding possibility of an explosive crash. The only thing better than sashaying away is accelerating down the straight.

	More than a decade after her breakout HBO series took off, Lena Dunham has come a long way as a writer and producer.


	The Golden Globe winner recently said she's come to find diversity is “one of the most important things” in making television after she was criticized for the lack of diverse characters featured on Girls, which ran for six seasons from 2012 to 2017.


	“I think one of the profound issues around Girls was that there was so little real estate for women in television [then] that if you had a show called Girls, which is such a monolithic name, it sounds like it's describing all the girls in all the places,” she explained to The Independent. “And so if it's not reflecting a multitude of experiences, I understand how that would be really disappointing to people.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Also starring Allison Williams, Jemima Kirke and Zosia Mamet, the show was criticized for mostly starring white actors, many of whom have since been dubbed ‘nepo babies'. Back in 2012, Dunham reasoned she is “a half-Jew, half-WASP” and wanted to avoid “tokenism in casting.”


	Dunham noted to The Independent that she “liked the conversation around Girls” as it was an important one to have, and she's since put what she's learned into practice, most recently on her Netflix series Too Much, premiering July 10 on the streamer.


	“The thing I have really come to believe is that one of the most important things is not just diversity in front of the camera, but it's diversity behind the camera. As a producer, one of my goals is to bring a lot of different voices into a position where they can tell their story,” added Dunham.


Too Much stars Meg Stalter as New Yorker Jessica, who moves to London after a disastrous breakup and sparks a romance with musician Felix (Will Sharpe). Co-created by Dunham and husband Luis Felber, the Girls alum plays Jessica's older sister, who has retreated from public life after a messy divorce sent her moving back in with their mom.

Can't fault her for her experiences. However her show was like a Woody Allen movie where you live in NYC and there's no POC at all unless in a club, playing jazz or r&b music or a sports event or areas where they are imagined to belong.

The issue was that the show took place in Brooklyn, and there were mad nonwhite people in Brooklyn at the time. Dunham and her ilk were seen as invaders. To me, Girls was the same as the Walking Dead, but with rich white people instead of zombies.

Something has always stayed with me about Girls.

They were Broke, not Poor.

THIS was the show. Privileged people.

You made the show the way you wanted your world reflected. Stand on that. The show wasn't for us. And we won't be watching this one either. All good for your audience.

Please go somewhere out of sight

	With the fifth and final season of The Boys approaching, Eric Kripke has something special in store for fans of his work.


	Soldier Boy actor Jensen Ackles recently teased his reunion with Supernatural co-stars Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins ahead of the Prime Video series' concluding episodes, for which their characters have not yet been revealed.


	“We see each other more often than you would think — honestly, at least once a month,” he told People after they starred in Kripke's CW series for 15 seasons from 2005 to 2020.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Ackles added, “It was weird. It was like inviting my friends over to somebody else's house for dinner. I was like, ‘Listen, guys, don't make me look bad. I got to stay here.' They were amazing. I can't wait to talk more about it because it was quite an experience.”

	











	After Kripke expressed his desire to work with Padalecki on the concluding season of The Boys, the actor told Deadline he's in. “The answer is yes,” he said last June.


	“We have talked [about a role]. As a matter of fact, we talked today,” added Padalecki. “I think at this point in my acting life, I only want to work on projects that I really care about or with people that I really care about, and obviously Eric and I are indelibly connected forever.”


	After Ackles joined the series as Soldier Boy during Season 3, his and Padalecki's Supernatural onscreen dad Jeffrey Dean Morgan appeared as Joe Kessler via Billy Butcher's hallucination in Season 4.

	











	This week, Kripke bid farewell to The Boys set as he wrapped the finale. “It's bittersweet, but my primary feeling is gratitude,” he wrote in part. “We have the best cast, the best crew, the most fun story to write, and something that is impossible to predict: the right timing. You wait your whole career to have maybe two of those things, if you're lucky. We got all of them.”


	The final season of The Boys, premiering in 2026, comes after Season 4 topped the Nielsen streaming scores for the first time, setting multiple records for Prime Video.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Netflix is bringing back Cyberpunk: Edgerunners","https://www.avclub.com/netflix-bringing-back-cyberpunk-edgerunners-teaser","Sun, 06 Jul 2025 03:00:00 GMT","

Among the various video game adaptations that have crept out of the woodwork over the last several years, few have been better received—especially critically—than Netflix's Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. Based on flawed-but-fascinating 2020 title Cyberpunk 2077 (itself based on classic tabletop RPG Cyberpunk), the anime series told a standalone story set in the futuristic world of Night City, invoking the vibes, and a few of the characters, of the interactive work, while telling its own story of desperation and survival for those running amongst the shadows.

And while the series ended its 2022 set of episodes about as definitively as a TV show can—happy endings in Night City being about as rare as clean air or a spot of sky unobstructed by neon—Netflix has now revealed it's bringing the show back. The streamer announced the news at Anime Expo 2025 earlier today, complete with a teaser that, well, let's just say that if you haven't watched the first season of the series, you might want to get caught up before clicking “Play” on the below video, because it's definitive about the fact that the show is moving on to new characters and stories.

﻿

Still, exciting news for fans of the series, which is produced by Japanese animation studio Trigger. Showrunner Bartosz Sztybor will return to head up the new season, promising viewers that he intends to make the new version of the show “of course, sadder, but it will be also darker, more bloody, and more raw.” (Hooray!) Directing, meanwhile, will fall to Kai Ikarashi, who previously directed the sixth episode of the first season—including some of its most harrowing moments.

No word yet on when Cyberpunk: Edgerunners II will premiere, but here's Netflix's loose synopsis for the season:

Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 presents a new standalone 10-episode story from the world of Cyberpunk 2077— a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge. In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","R.I.P. Mark Snow, composer of The X-Files theme music","https://www.avclub.com/mark-snow-dies-x-files-theme-song-composer","Sun, 06 Jul 2025 00:50:00 GMT","

Mark Snow has died. Although a composer who worked on hundreds of TV shows, TV films, and theatrical releases across a career that spanned five decades of compositions, Snow will likely go down in history for a single, indelible track: The theme song from The X-Files. But while that song—released on albums under the name “Materia Primoris,” but known to every sentient person who's heard it simply as “the theme from The X-Files“—represents the apex of Snow's reach as a composer, it barely scratches the breadth of his body of work. His compositions appear in huge swathes of TV history, from Pee-Wee's Playhouse to Hart To Hart to Starsky & Hutch to Smallville to Blue Bloods, to dozens of other major shows. Per Variety, Snow died on Friday at his home in Connecticut. He was 78.

Born in Brooklyn and trained at Julliard, Snow spent his early career writing and composing music as part of hybrid project New York Rock & Roll Ensemble. After a brief stint working as a record producer, a relative in the industry convinced Aaron Spelling to allow the young Snow (who was just then adopting the stage name, after previously performing under his birth name, Martin Fulterman) to try his hand at composing TV music for his '70s cop show The Rookies. From there, Snow embarked on a massively successful career as a small-screen composer, grabbing an early success when he became composer for long-running mystery series Hart To Hart.

In 1993, Snow was working on scoring low-budget horror movies when his friend, TV producer R.W. Goodwin, approached him about a possible new gig: A new Fox supernatural procedural called The X-Files. In Snow's telling, the initial audition process was rocky enough, and the show's prospects uncertain enough, that he considered turning down the job; instead, his work on the series would wind up burning his music into the brains of millions. Snow talked, in various interviews, about elements of serendipity that influenced the creation of the track that would ultimately be the series' theme song, including stumbling, entirely by accident, on the echoing sound effects that help give the song much of its haunting vibe. But he also tapped into years of growing familiarity with synthesizers—a necessity when working on shows without the time or budget to hire out full orchestras—to lay down the song's A-minor melancholy. (Including, most spectacularly, its iconic six-note whistle.)

﻿

Besides making him the rare TV composer to chart on multiple countries' single charts (the theme, released as an instrumental, performed well in both the U.K. and France), Snow's wider work on the show also helped develop both its tone, and its reputation. Working largely with synths and ambient sounds, Snow spent nine seasons (plus the revivals) helping to build The X-Files' vibes, adding immense texture to the series and contributing to each of its ultimately 200-plus episodes. (While also producing music for the franchise's movies—getting to work with an orchestra for once—as well as affiliated shows like Millennium and The Lone Gunmen.) His profile considerably raised, Snow continued to work in TV for the rest of his life, composing for One Tree Hill, Smallville, The Ghost Whisperer, Ringer, and, finally, Blue Bloods—with the CBS long-runner serving as a capstone for his career, with Snow ultimately writing music for all 290 of its episodes by the time it concluded in 2024.

For all of the Hallmarkies dreaming of being swept off their feet by a Hallmark Channel hunk in real life, actor Jack Wagner just provided a glimmer of hope that it's possible.

In a social media video shared by Parade on July 2, 2025, The “When Calls The Heart” star, who just began filming his 13th season as Bill Avery on Hallmark Channel's hit series, revealed that his new wife, Michelle Wolf, considers herself one of countless “Hearties” — the nickname for the show's devoted fans.

Wagner, who rose to fame in the 90s and 2000s on daytime soap operas including “The Bold & the Beautiful” and primetime dramas like “Melrose Place” before moving over to Hallmark, married Wolf on May 18, per Swooon. 

Among the things they have in common is their experience as professional musicians (he had hit songs in the 80s and she has written songs for and performed with numerous acts including N*Sync, Oleta Adams, BB King, and The Scorpions, according to her website. Another common bond they share is her love of “When Calls The Heart,” which he's starred in since it premiered in 2014. 

“She watches ‘When Calls The Heart,'” Wager, 65, told Parade. “She's a Heartie. They're called Hearties. So I'm able to measure the show by watching Michelle, my wife now.” 

Sitting on his couch during the virtual interview, he pretended Wolf was sitting next to him and said, “Like, if I'm here watching and she's there, like, I can literally, like, I'll watch her and her reaction … ‘Ah! Oh my god!' You know? Because she's totally engaged as a normal person.”

Wagner continued, “I can't watch shows as a normal person, right? I think technically and, ‘What could happened here?” and ‘What could have been better?' You know, she watches as a normal person, okay?” 

The actor noted that they have never sat down together to watch “The Bold and the Beautiful,” which he returned to for a story arc in June. 

“Maybe she'll record it and maybe we'll have some time to check out some of those episodes, and see how she reacts to that,” he told Parade. “But she's fully invested in ‘When Calls The Heart' in terms of how it moves people and touches people.” 

The news of Wagner's wedding came as a big surprise to fans when Wolf shared Instagram photos on May 31, as initially reported by EntertainmentNow. In Wolf's pics, she and Wagner were beaming — with him in a tuxedo and her in a wedding dress and veil. 

Images included them laughing at an outdoor altar as the priest marrying them looked on, and of them posing at a small reception with a bar behind them.

She has since made her account private, but she previously posted periodically about dating Wagner on her account. However, the two never announced publicly that they were engaged and have kept a low profile. They did, however, attend the MovieGuide Awards in February 2024, as seen in the video above. 

Wagner returned to the Vancouver set of “When Calls The Heart” on July 1, posting a video from the airport in his Instagram Stories — as he does every summer — to thank Hearties for another season. He's not the only newlywed in the cast, though. Series lead Erin Krakow and co-star Ben Rosenbaum also got married in a surprise wedding in June.

Hailey Bieber's dad Stephen Baldwin briefly commented on his daughter's famous husband Justin Bieber.

Stephen Baldwin appeared on the June 25 episode of “The Adam Carolla Show” and said he is very happy with both of his children's spouses.

“I'm blessed that my two daughters married two great guys,” Stephen Baldwin told Carolla.

The 59-year-old shares two daughters with his longtime wife Kennya. His oldest daughter is 32-year-old Alaia Baldwin Aronow. She is married to businessman Andrew Aronow.

Hailey Bieber married the “Baby” singer in 2018, and the two share a son named Jack Blues. 

The model discussed divorce rumors while speaking with Vogue in May.

“Well, I thought seven years in it would've [died down] already, and it hasn't,” told the outlet regarding the rumors.

She thought the rumors would have stopped since she had a child, but it only continued.

“You would think after having a child, people would maybe move on, chill out a little bit, but no,” she added. “So I guess these [expletive] are going to be mad.”

The two were last spotted at the end of June dancing at a Martin Garrix concert in Los Angeles, according to TMZ.

During the podcast, Stephen Baldwin also gushed about both of his daughters.

“The Usual Suspects” star praised their independence.

“I let my kids do what they're doing,” he added. “And if they want to throw a boomerang at me, I'll call them back.”

He also made sure to express how proud he is of Hailey for selling her Rhode Skin company to e.l.f. Beauty in a $1 billion deal. Rhode is described as “a line of curated skincare essentials” and is made for a variety of skin types.

He said it took the 28-year-old three years to develop the brand.

“The cool part of it is she's super smart, smart in business,” he gushed. “Succeeded as a model prior to everything she's doing now. But the cool part was she actually had an offer to do something pretty big and cool in the cosmetics a couple years ago and didn't.”

He mentioned that no matter how successful his daughters are, family is always the most important thing.

“The sweet part of my kids, too, is, in the wake of whatever their success is, their dad remains the same,” the actor added. “I've always been the same way. You know you're going to tell your daughter the truth.”

The world lost a talented and memorable '90s icon yesterday, leaving fans and co-stars alike in shock. Julian McMahon, best known for his iconic roles in “Charmed” and “Nip/Tuck,” tragically passed away at the age of 56. The sad news was shared by his family, specifically his wife, Kelly McMahon, revealing the actor passed due to a private battle with cancer.

“Julian loved life. He loved his family. He loved his friends. He loved his work, and he loved his fans. His deepest wish was to bring joy into as many lives as possible,” she revealed. “We ask for support during this time to allow our family to grieve in privacy. And we wish for all of those to whom Julian brought joy, to continue to find joy in life. We are grateful for the memories.”

McMahon's former co-stars, Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano, took to social media to mourn the loss of their beloved friend. Both talented powerhouses showcased the immense impact McMahon had on their lives.

A post shared by Holly Combs (@thehmc)

Combs, who played Piper Halliwell on “Charmed,” shared a heartfelt tribute on Instagram, remembering their time together both on and off set. McMahon portrayed Cole Turner, a pivotal character in the series, from 2000 to 2005. The relationship with Combs' character was central to some of the show's most memorable and iconic storylines. This due to their strong characters crashing when it came to protecting Phoebe, who was the youngest Halliwell sister, and Cole's love interest.

Combs described McMahon as “one of a kind,” reflecting on his zest for life and his unique ability to make others laugh. The actress went on to post a montage of several throwback moments from the show, writing, “The joy and laughter you were the direct cause of will always be remembered. I hope you find our lady friend and dance in those rose petals.”

The heartfelt message is likely a reference to Shannen Doherty, who played Prue Halliwell during the show's first three seasons. Doherty tragically passed away in 2024 after her battle with cancer. 

Combs' words resonated deeply with fans, suggesting a hopeful reunion between McMahon and Doherty in the afterlife. Fans reacted kindly to the post, sharing their love for the actress, all while sending their condolences.

“Oh no, I'm so sorry. I saw an article where his wife said, He just wanted to bring joy to everyone. Well I will tell you that you brought me a lot of joy as Cole charmed. I always loved you. And I know I wasn't the only one resting in peace,” a fan said.

Another added, “This is so heartbreaking. 💔 I'm so sorry to hear this and I'm so sorry for the loss of your friend. I loved you all together on Charmed.”

A post shared by Alyssa Milano (@milano_alyssa)

Milano, who portrayed Phoebe Halliwell, also shared her own tribute to the late actor. On “Charmed,” Milano's character had a complex and passionate romantic relationship with McMahon's character. It quickly became a fan favorite and one of the show's most iconic love/hate storylines due to their character differences. Milano described McMahon's death as “too soon” and “too unfair,” remembering the strong connection they shared during filming. 

“Julian McMahon was magic. That smile. That laugh. That talent. That presence. He walked into a room and lit it up—not just with charisma, but with kindness. With mischief. With soulful understanding,” Milano wrote. 

She also fondly remembered him as a “dear friend,” emphasizing that their bond extended far beyond their on-screen romance. “Julian was more than my TV husband. He was a dear friend. The kind who checks in,” she said. “The kind who remembers. The kind who shares. The kind who tells you the truth, even when it's uncomfortable—but always with love.”

McMahon's death has left a void in the hearts of many, but his legacy as a talented actor continues to live on. Known for his unique roles, including in “Nip/Tuck,” where he portrayed the charming but troubled Dr. Christian Troy, the actor knew how to create a fan base in an instant. The actor also made a significant mark in film, most notably as Doctor Doom in the “Fantastic Four” movies. There, he starred alongside Chris Evans, Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd, and Michael Chiklis. 

The actor's charisma, talent, and larger-than-life personality made him a standout in every role. It's safe to say his contributions to both TV and film will be remembered for years to come.

As tributes continue to pour in, it's clear that McMahon's impact on the entertainment industry and those who knew him personally will never be forgotten. Fans and colleagues alike now carry his vibrant spirit with them, and his memory will live on through the characters he brought to life.

Julian McMahon lost his very private battle with cancer on July 2, 2025. The actor is best known for his roles in “Nip/Tuck,” “Charmed,” and “Fantastic Four”; however, he began his career in the soap opera world. 

His first acting gig was on the Australian show “The Power, The Passion,” and he met his first wife, Dannii Minogue, while acting on another popular Australian soap, “Home and Away.”

The actor first met Dannii on the set of “Home and Away” in Australia, and the two fell in love quickly. However, there were issues right from the start, and Danni explained things in an article for Women's Day, years ago.

Dannii admitted Sonia, who was the wife of former Prime Minister William McMahon, wasn't a fan of her.

“His family did not like me. There's a certain social pecking order, and I was definitely not in that scene. She [Sonia] only spoke to me a couple of times,” Dannii revealed.

“On the actual day of the wedding, there was drama. [Sonia] said she wasn't going to show up, so that's quite stressful. Julian and I were going ahead with the marriage regardless. She did end up coming and was causing a scene … it wasn't the greatest … it was hard. I just tried to stay away from it, I just wanted to enjoy the day.”

The strained relationship even escalated to the point that Dannii was banned from entering Julian's family home.

“She would not let me go to the family house. Sometimes [Julian] had to go and collect something, and I was waiting in the car out front. It was as if I'd done something wrong to the family, but I hadn't done anything wrong,” Dannii said. Sadly, their marriage only lasted about 18 months.

Julian's breakthrough role came in 1993 with “Another World” as Ian Rain. After romances with Judi Evans's Paulina and Amy Carlson's Josie, Ian left town in 1995.

In a 2020 interview with Soap Opera Digest, McMahon looked back on his AW days fondly. “Oh, my God,” he said of his debut on the Bay City scene. “The first thing I did was at the Cory mansion and my first scene was with Judi Evans — oh, what a sweet, sweet girl, she was so kind to me I can't even tell you, she was so supportive and so caring — and here I was this 22-year-old dude from Australia and the first scene I had to shoot was in a Speedo, getting out of the Cory pool and I was like, ‘Oh, all right, I guess this is what you do. You put on your undies and you get out of the pool.' ”

“The soap actors are kind of their own breed, and I've never met one who's not ridiculously passionate about what they do. It's almost like its own theater company or something. And I just really kind of thrived off of that…. I just considered it such a blessing,” said McMahon of the soap community.

“I remember the soap fans were great fans and I loved my time there, so I'm just glad to hear that some of the soaps are still going, and hopefully some of the fans still enjoy some of the work I put out these days.”

Julian died at the age of 56 on July 2, 2025. His wife, Kelly McMahon, confirmed the sad news to Deadline, saying, “With an open heart, I wish to share with the world that my beloved husband, Julian McMahon, died peacefully this week after a valiant effort to overcome cancer.”

She went on to say, “Julian loved life. He loved his family. He loved his friends. He loved his work, and he loved his fans. His deepest wish was to bring joy into as many lives as possible. We ask for support during this time to allow our family to grieve in privacy. And we wish for all of those to whom Julian brought joy to continue to find joy in life. We are grateful for the memories.”

It's been a tumultuous month since “Doc” star and Hallmark Channel fan favorite Scott Wolf and his wife, former MTV “The Real World” star Kelley Wolf, announced that they were divorcing after 21 years of marriage.  

The Wolfs' divorce news took fans by surprise on June 10, 2025, but even more shocking was how quickly circumstances spiraled after their separate announcements, from Kelley's detainment by police to Scott being granted temporary custody of their kids. With multiple court decisions due in early July, the coming days will be highly consequential for the former couple and their family. Here's the latest…

Kelley was the first to announce her and Scott's impending divorce, sharing the news in an Instagram post on June 10. He then followed with his own statement to People on June 11, calling it the “hardest decision” he'd ever made to file for divorce. In a stunning twist, Kelley was detained by police on June 13 and placed under an involuntary hold at a local mental health hospital, she later confirmed.

Then, on June 26, Today.com reported, a Utah judge granted Scott temporary sole custody of their kids — Jackson, 16, Miller, 12, and Lucy, 11. The judge also issued a temporary restraining order requiring that Kelley have no contact with Scott, their kids, or his brother Michael.

A custody hearing was scheduled for July 1, per Us Weekly, to decide if Kelley could have supervised parent time and to discuss any financial matters. Those discussions have not been made public. Meanwhile, the restraining order remains in effect until July 9, according to the outlet, unless a judge makes changes before then.

A post shared by KELLEY WOLF (@kelleywolf)

Kelley, who's worked for years as a certified life coach, has shared dozens of Instagram Stories and posts since her release from the hospital in late June, insisting that she is doing well. She initially stayed at a Park City resort while Scott traveled with their kids. 

She eventually returned to their family's home, which the restraining order said Scott and the kids had exclusive use of, per Us Weekly. Sharing videos in her Instagram Stories, she filled her SUV with some of her belongings and the family's dogs with the help of friend Josef Kirk Myers, who spent several days with her. 

Kelley wrote in multiple Instagram Stories that she was heading to European cities like Paris and Spain, but has spent the last week at a Utah cabin she posts from frequently, writing on June 29, “I am at a friends place now and eating her food and they are making me laugh.” 

In a couple of videos, she has shown videos or photos of people cooking for her or delivering food, but covered their faces because they asked not to be shown on camera. In a post on July 4, she wrote that “peace is a state of mind” and that she is “ready to begin again.”

Wearing the same floral skirt and plaid flannel shirt she'd been seen in several days of a videos, Kelley posted in her Stories on July 3, “I feel like I just had, I don't even know, 10 people, and now I'm alone, and we all know how much I like to just relax, listen to music. So, ready? Yes, I have not changed my clothes in a few days.” 

On July 5, she excitedly posted several Instagram Stories about a friend named Angela Stem coming to visit her. She posted videos of herself shopping for groceries, writing that her heart was racing about her friend visiting, and later posted a photo of a charcuterie board on the deck. 

Kelley did not share any visuals of her friend, but the Arkansas native wrote in her Stories, “This is my Arkansas happiness…we love good food…good music. Quiet and good people…but we know how to do this… Let's go baby! Angela is here!!!” Stem has made her Instagram profile private.

After 20 years and 17 seasons, it's tough to imagine a world where “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” isn't on television, but there was a point where one member of its reliable ensemble — which consists of Charlie Day, Glenn Howerton, Rob McElhenney (aka Rob Mac), Kaitlin Olson, and Danny DeVito — almost bowed out. At the July 1 PaleyLive 20th anniversary panel (via People), Howerton revealed that prior to the start of Season 12, which broadcast on FXX in 2017, he told the creative team, “Look, I just don't want to wear out our welcome.”

 










“I was worried that maybe we had sort of peaked or something, and I just was like, you know, we've been doing this for a long time. And I think I was also anxious,” Howerton said. “I had not figured out yet how to stretch myself and be able to do other things that I wanted to do with my career outside of the show… I just hadn't figured out how to do that yet. I was aching to do other things, and so I was starting to feel a little boxed in, frankly.”

The cast was insistent, saying that they did not want the show to end. He simply said, “Oh, well I can't stop you.” “And then Seasons 13 and 14, I came back as an actor but I wasn't in the writers' room.”

Howerton had made appearances in many other series, including “The Mindy Project” and “Fargo,” but after he “figured out how to do that” — meaning juggle additional projects — he would take on such hefty assignments as the sitcom “A.P. Bio” and films like “The Hunt” and “Blackberry.” Meanwhile, “It's Always Sunny” kept going, and so did he.

“[They] just kept writing it and kept writing him in,” McElhenney said, the show's official creator. “And we're like, he's just gonna eventually say he's coming back. That's what happened.”

“It's Always Sunny” will drop its first two episodes of its 17th season, which will contain eight episodes, on July 9. Its season premiere will include the highly-anticipated second part of a crossover event with fellow Philadelphia-set sitcom “Abbott Elementary.” An episode of that series with guest appearances from the entire “Sunny” cast aired on ABC in January.

	As lawmakers drafted what is poised to become the landmark legislative achievement of his second term, President Donald Trump told Republicans in Congress in May, “Don't fuck around with Medicaid.” 


	On Wednesday, as he met with holdouts on the “Big Beautiful Bill” to try to get it over the finish line, Trump told members of Congress if they want to win future elections, they should avoid touching Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. He's not wrong: 82 percent of voters say cutting Medicaid is unacceptable, including 71 percent of Trump's voters. And 56 percent of voters say protecting these vital programs should be the Trump administration's top priority. 


	It seems that someone may want to tell the president that the bill he signed into law Friday following a marathon of all-nighters in Congress last week does, indeed, fuck with Medicaid — in a big way. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Voters elected Trump in November in hopes he would fulfill his promise to “end inflation and make America affordable again.” That promise hasn't materialized; in fact, groceries, housing, and electricity bills are all getting more expensive. And with the stroke of his signature Friday, Trump has broken his promise on health care, too.

	











	Trump's budget law will strip Medicaid coverage from as many as 15 million people, primarily by imposing work requirements on all supposedly “able-bodied” adults under the age of 65 — making them jump through needless hurdles to access life-saving care. Without Medicaid, these Americans would be forced to go without insulin, dialysis, and cancer screenings — or God forbid, cancer treatments. 

	











	State lawmakers will be forced to find billions of dollars in their already squeezed budgets to cover the Medicaid expenses the feds have pushed onto their balance sheets. More than 300 rural hospitals and nearly 600 nursing homes are at risk of shutting down. And for those who try to buy individual health coverage through state marketplaces when they get kicked off Medicaid, their price tag will be double what it is now.

	Republicans falsely claim their bill doesn't cut Medicaid, but that is precisely the point of their policies. Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise's nose must have been growing when he said last week that these provisions will make sure “the truly disabled and needy will be able to get better access to Medicaid.” According to the GOP, “better access” apparently means hiking health care costs for the poorest Americans and implementing a maze of red tape.


	Unfortunately for the Republicans trying to pull a fast one on the American people, we already know exactly what happens when Medicaid recipients are forced to deal with onerous requirements to access benefits they're entitled to. And that's because they've run this play before. 


	During Trump's first term, he enabled states to pilot work requirements for their Medicaid programs. New Hampshire, for example, attempted to implement work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries in 2019 by requiring them to submit proof that they worked, volunteered, or were in school for at least 100 hours per month. In the first month of the new policy, more than two-thirds of Medicaid recipients were unable to comply with requirements — not because they didn't meet them but because the administrative burden was so high. The online form didn't even have an option for individuals to report their employment. Within weeks of the requirements going into effect and nearly 20,000 people at risk of losing coverage, the state halted implementation.  


	In Arkansas, Medicaid recipients who were at or just above the poverty level ($28,000 for a family of 3) were required to report at least 80 work hours per month. For the first five months, recipients could only do so through an online portal — in a state where a quarter of households lacked high-speed internet. When the state added a phone option, callers waited on hold for up to an hour. In just seven months, one in four Medicaid recipients subject to the requirement lost their health coverage.

	Scalise claims the work requirements in the GOP bill mean the “35-year-old who's sitting in his mom's basement playing video games is gonna have to go get a job again.” Wrong again. In fact, the evidence shows that work requirements do nothing to increase employment. That's because nearly two-thirds of working-age adults on Medicaid are employed, and most of the remaining third aren't working because they're students, caregivers, ill, or disabled. 


	For the 31 million working-age adults on Medicaid, the Republican budget bill will mean they get confusing letters in the mail directing them to spend countless hours struggling to navigate glitchy government websites to update their address and submit their timesheets. (Of course, that's for those who have stable mailing addresses and access to the internet.)


	When the legislation temporarily stalled in Congress last week amid concerns about the devastating effects of these health care cuts, Vice President J.D. Vance posted on X that “the minutiae of the Medicaid policy … is immaterial.” 


	That ‘immaterial minutiae,' experts estimate, could cause as many as 200,000 preventable deaths when Americans can't access the care or treatments they need, hospitals and nursing homes shut down, and insurance premiums become even more unaffordable.

	There's nothing immaterial about the impact these cuts will have on Americans, and Vance's change in tune is particularly interesting in light of the fact that he made the case for Trump in 2017 on the basis that Trump was more than just “a Republican focused entirely on cutting taxes for the wealthy,” adding that Trump hadn't campaigned “saying ‘'I'm going to take away your Social Security and your Medicaid.'” 


	Vance was half right. Trump isn't focused entirely on cutting taxes for the wealthy. He's also focused on gutting Medicaid and taking away health care from millions of Americans.

	Experts are concerned about the dangerous conditions at Alligator Alcatraz, the immigrant detention center that opened Tuesday in the Florida Everglades. Hurricanes, flooding, and mosquitoes pose a more likely threat to people incarcerated there than the alligators and snakes that President Donald Trump has “joked” about. 


	Built in eight days, the facility consists of large tents, bunk beds, and chain link fences that form cages to hold about 3,000 people. It has already flooded once. Despite the rudimentary setup, it will cost $450 million a year to run, according to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.


	The first group of immigrants have already been brought to Alligator Alcatraz, according to the Florida Division of Emergency Management. “Florida is proud to help facilitate @realDonaldTrump's mission to enforce immigration law,” the division posted on X. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The facility's inhospitable nature is a selling point for Republicans. “If people get out, there's not much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons,” Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said in a video promoting Alligator Alcatraz. “Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.” 

	











	The immigrants “are in a facility that is very inaccessible to lawyers, to family members, to oversight,” Renata Bozzetto, deputy director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, told The Washington Post in an article published Saturday. “So the location being so remote and isolated is a problem. Being in an environmentally fragile ecosystem is a problem. Being constructed with temporary materials will be catastrophic in case of a hurricane.”

	











	The facility is in a High-Velocity Hurricane Zone, where building code requires that buildings have a wind-resistant design. Florida's Emergency Management Director, Kevin Guthrie, told The Washington Post that the structures are rated for winds traveling 110 miles an hour. For reference, top speeds of last year's Hurricane Milton reached 180 miles per hour.

	In a state where backyard pools are surrounded on all sides by screens, the mosquitos are so bad that television reporters are even having trouble doing their jobs. 


	“You're probably wondering why I'm wearing a hoodie and a rain jacket, and that's because you can barely walk outside here because of the mosquitoes,” said NBC6's Hatzel Vela. “Naturally, when you get a lot of rain and puddles of water, that of course breeds a lot of mosquitoes.”


	The mosquitoes can cause serious health risks.


	“The risk of mosquito-borne disease at this site is significant,” Durland Fish, professor emeritus of epidemiology at the Yale University School of Public Health told The Washington Post. Mosquitoes in the Everglades can cause neurological damage like encephalitis, which can be life threatening. 


	“The second you open up your car, your car is infested with mosquitoes,” Florida Rep. Anna Eskamani told Fox 13. She said she wore a mosquito net and was still bitten dozens of times. 


	Eskamani was one of five Democrats who were denied entry to the facility on Thursday. 


	“Florida law gives legislators the authority to make unannounced visits to state-run facilities — to inspect conditions and check on the wellbeing of the people inside. I've served in the Legislature for 13 years, and this has never happened,” state Sen. Shevrin Jones posted on X. 


	“This is a blatant abuse of power and an attempt to conceal human rights violations from the public eye,” the lawmakers said in a joint statement.

	Some donors are cashing in on the camp, Rolling Stone reported earlier this week. For example, the president of CDR Companies, which Bloomberg reported “will run medical services and did some site preparation,” has made donations to President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. 


	The facility is surrounded on three sides by the homes of Miccosukee and Seminole people, including their ceremonial sites. “It's a place where we come for healing, where we come to pray,” Betty Osceola, a member of the Everglades Advisory Board and the Miccosukee Tribe told NBC News.

Michael Douglas has revealed that while he's not officially retired from acting, he has “no real intentions” of returning to the big screen.


	Speaking at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival to present a newly restored print of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest — which he won an Oscar for as a producer on the 1970 classic — the 80-year-old Douglas was asked about his future plans as an actor. 


	“I have not worked since 2022 purposefully because I realized I had to stop,” Douglas said (via Variety). “I had been working pretty hard for almost 60 years, and I did not want to be one of those people who dropped dead on the set. I have no real intentions of going back. I say I'm not retired because if something special came up, I'd go back, but otherwise, no.”


	Douglas last appeared on the big screen in 2023's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and starred 2024's Franklin, an Apple TV+ biographical series about Ben Franklin; both projects finished filming three years ago, and Douglas hasn't worked in front of the camera since.

	The actor did hint at “one little independent movie” he is “trying to get a good script out of,” but besides that project, he has no other plans to return to films, and is “happy to play the wife” to Catherine Zeta-Jones. “I am happy for Catherine to go to work – and she is very busy,” he said.


	The topic of Douglas' future came up after the actor discussed his battle with tongue cancer, with Douglas saying his course of action allowed him another decade of roles. “Stage 4 cancer is not a holiday, but there aren't many choices, are there? I went with the program, involving chemo and radiation, and was fortunate,” Douglas said, adding that his friend and actor Larry Hagman died from a similar diagnosis. “The surgery would have meant not being able to talk and removing part of my jaw and that would have been limiting as an actor.”

	“Let the madness begin!” bellowed a mischievous Ozzy Osbourne from his bat-and-skull encrusted throne in front of a sold-out Villa Park in Birmingham, England. The Prince of Darkness had finally taken to the stage after a marathon of legendary metal bands paid homage to his life and work throughout the day for his and Black Sabbath‘s Back to the Beginning concert on Saturday, July 5. 


	The Summer of Sabbath had been in full flow in Birmingham for weeks now, though. The proud home city of heavy metal rolled out the purple carpet for its most famous sons' homecoming. Boozers were decked with purple balloons and flags; murals were everywhere you looked; people donned Ozzy outfits, flooding the streets with battered T-shirts and denim jackets. It felt like a World Cup final for the metal fans who flooded in from every corner of the planet. 


	That carnival atmosphere hit the moment you stepped out of New Street Station, where fans gathered around the nearby Black Sabbath Bridge mural, which Osbourne and the band duly signed earlier in the week. We met one fan from London, who said he was on a Sabbath pilgrimage before the gates opened later in the day. “I'm going around the city doing all of the sites like The Crown where they played their first ever show, the various exhibitions and Ozzy the Bull!” 

	











	This of course was before you even made your way to Villa Park, the historic football ground housed in the working class suburb which was once home to the band's four members. 

	











	Upon arrival, we were greeted by rumbles of distortion and a giant inflatable Ozzy who watched over his parish. Heading into the stadium, Cody Holl, a fan who traveled from Pennsylvania, was in a state of giddy delirium. “It's Black Sabbath's last Sabbath,” Holl said. “I've never seen them before and I told myself after that 2017 tour, I'm going no matter what, I just had to be here.”


	The heavy metal royalty who graced the stage throughout the day were clearly struck by a similar sense of awe, that's perhaps because Black Sabbath have shaped and influenced each and every one of them, from openers Mastadon right through to thrash veterans Anthrax and Lamb of God. The latter delivered an early standout moment with a cover of “Children of the Grave,” which drew a gaping circle pit that formed on the pitch.

	The day was packed with such moments: For those lucky enough to get a ticket to the sold-out bash, the main challenge presented was bottling it all up. 


	Even on this star-studded lineup though, there was always room for surprise as Yungblud joined the day's first supergroup set for a cover of “Changes.” Stomping onstage with spit and venom, he dedicated the band's most heartfelt song to the late Liverpool striker Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car crash. “We'd all collectively like to dedicate this next song to Diogo Jota. God bless Black Sabbath and God bless Ozzy Osbourne,” he declared before a heartfelt rendition that stopped the stadium in its tracks. 


	Amid the palpable emotion there was also scope for the ridiculous as Blink-182's Travis Barker, Red Hot Chili Pepper's Chad Smith, and Tool's Danny Carey indulged in a drum-off fronted by Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello. That was before Billy Corgan and Judas Priest guitarist KK Downing entered the fray and tore into “Breaking the Law.”


	The extravaganza rolled on with more legends including Alice in Chains, Gojira, Pantera, and Tool, who all seized their respective 30-minute sets. As the sun dipped under the clouds, Slayer took to the stage and produced the day's biggest moshpit so far, the kind that felt like dicing with death when entering as they shredded through genre-defining epics like “Reign in Blood” and “Angel of Death.”

Guns N' Roses teed up the home stretch towards Metallica, Osbourne, and Sabbath. Having headlined this very venue themselves but a week prior, the rock giants were clearly loving life as they covered “Sabbath Bloody Sabbath” before the iconic guitar intro of “Welcome to the Jungle.” 

	











	One of the most profound tributes to Sabbath came from Metallica's James Hetfield as he surveyed the thousands ahead of him. “Without Sabbath there would be no Metallica, thank you boys for giving us a purpose in life,” he said before unleashing a career-spanning run of the band's biggest anthems.  


	After a strobing montage of his glory days, Osbourne took to the stage and shot straight from the hip. “It's so good to be on this fucking stage you have no idea,” he said before questioning, “Have you had a good day today?” before the ominous organ intro of “Mr. Crowley.”


	Osbourne was trembling with emotion as he sang the ballad “Mama I'm Coming Home,” and the sense of meaning was almost unprecedented as he was back where it all began over 50 years ago.


	After a riotous rendition of “Crazy Train,” he departed and returned for a condensed set with Black Sabbath, who arrived to the rain and church bell tolls of “War Pigs.” It was pure theater as Osbourne clutched the microphone stand with OZZY tattooed upon his knuckles and sang that opening line that still speaks to the world today: “Generals gathered in their masses…”


	Though confined to his chair, Osbourne writhed and wriggled like a man summoning every last inch of the hell-raising spirit still in him as he bowed out with “Iron Man” and “Paranoid.” “Go fucking crazy, it's the last song,” he said before the latter and boy did the masses oblige. 


	For all the false farewells and goodbyes in his career, there was something so final about this one that added a crushing poignancy to the night.  


	The great tragedy is that so often such legends die before celebrations on this level can take place, yet by some great miracle or divine intervention Ozzy Osbourne was here to take his final bow with his own tribe.

	“I Don't Know”“Mr. Crowley”“Suicide Solution”“Mama, I'm Coming Home”“Crazy Train”

	As college students on the cusp of graduation, we face an uncertain future. We've spent the last few years sleeping in class, cheating on homework assignments in our dreams, and discussing the nuances of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In other words, we are anything but prepared for real work.


	So as we gaze into the soul-sucking, meaningless abyss that is postgraduate life, we can't help but ask: What's the fastest track to success? Med school plus residency would take eight years. Becoming a CEO, nine. Even the failed-actor-to-barista pipeline is six years minimum. But there's one job that's available to every American. A job that you can get in one day, with no interview. A job that allows you to both follow your passions and make a real difference: the presidency.


	Now, we're not stupid. We know that the president technically needs to be 35 years of age. But to that we say: What does 22 plus 22 plus 22 plus 22 equal? Surely it's over 35. Historically, the president has never been four separate people. But think about how much the president has to do on a daily basis: Shaking hands. Kissing babies. Shaking babies. Just one-fourth of the job is quite a lot of responsibility.

	Congress has only allocated only $400,000 dollars for the presidential salary, but $100,000 isn't bad for your first job out of college. Plus, it's D.C. It's not like we're living in Beverly Hills. The gig comes with housing, which allows us to skip the hunt for a grubby sublet, and we hear the whole place is prefurnished. Granted, we're probably looking at a few hundred a month for food and gas, but that still leaves us with plenty of money to launch our AI dog-walking startup.

UFO expert Kathleen Marden holds up one of her books about UFO abductions and other anomalies at the UFO Museum on Friday.

During her long career as a UFO investigator and researcher, Kathleen Marden worked on multiple studies involving thousands of experiencers — parties who say they have seen or interacted with entities not known on earth. She spoke about surveys and analysis of “experiencers” at the International UFO Museum and Research Center on Friday.

Marden is the niece of Betty and Barney Hill, a couple purported to have been abducted and examined by aliens in September 1961. Early on, she was convinced that what the Hills experienced were otherworldly encounters. As Marden was nearing the conclusion of her presentation titled, “The ET Presence: A Multidisciplinary Assessment,” she began talking about the United States Congressional Hearing on UFOs that occurred in 2024 and the subsequent All-domain Anomaly Resolution. 

This document, touted as a historical report on U.S. government studies about Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or UAP for short, was “an enormous lie.”

“The military-industrial intelligence complex has exerted its power,” she said. 

Marden's examples include threats being targeted toward civilian investigators now “being worse than ever” and an uptick of misinformation delivered to the public through movies that use people's real names. On Saturday, Marden focused on what happened to her aunt and uncle with the lecture “Betty and Barney Hill: Their UFO Encounter and the Aftermath.”  

Nearly 65 years have elapsed since the Hills were sought out by what appears to be extraterrestrial beings. What happened to them while traveling home to Portsmouth, New Hampshire after visiting Niagara Falls and Montreal is also the first widely reported information about a UFO abduction in the United States.

As the trustee of her aunt Betty's estate, Marden has made it a priority to protect her aunt and uncle's reputations as honest people who were also involved in making their community better. Betty was a social worker and her husband worked for the post office. The interracial couple, Barney was black and Betty was white, was involved in civil rights issues and the NAACP. Barney was also on a local body of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.

A newspaper broke the story about the Hills' abduction in 1965. While the reporting was a substantial breech of their privacy, it prompted other witnesses to come forward with their accounts. They reported what they saw and went through to authorities, including the U.S. Air Force. 

Significant aspects of what Betty went through had been buried deep in her subconscious. She was having discomforting dreams. Barney remembered more about what had happened. In 1963, his emotional distress became “a life-threatening condition,” Marden explained before talking about her aunt and uncle's visits to a neuropsychiatrist who used hypnosis and therapy.

The doctor hypnotized each of them separately because of how they were affected by the abduction, which included medical exams with some invasive procedures, Marden said. 

“Betty's dreams seemed to real to be dreams,” she said about her aunt's having five days of starting her sleeping thoughts with conscious recall, then recalling their car being surrounded by the abductors and “being walked to a craft” and ”taken to examining rooms.”      

Experts tested the dress she had been wearing the night of the event and found residue of materials that had no reason to be there and another was able to recreate a part of the galaxy in which one of abductors said was where came from within the universe.

And such findings were verified by other experts.

Reports that came from the government were twisted to make the Hills look bad and was how the government kept the truth from the public.  

Roswell-born actress Demi Moore and actor Colman Domingo — both previous Academy Award nominees — are starring in an upcoming film about the Hills titled ”Strange Arrivals.” This project is at a point in the movie-making process referred to as “development/pre-production.”

“Their experience catapulted them to fame and celebrity, but underneath that notoriety simmered the truth of what really happened that night, which would test even the most epic of romances,” according to Variety, an entertainment industry publication.  

“Despite all the evidence you have seen, a new Hollywood movie is under production that will depict Betty as a delusional woman and Barney as the man who loves her and believes in her,” she said.

TWO Architecture graduates from the Cavite State University College of Engineering and Information Technology (CvSU-CEIT) won the Student Thesis Project Award of Merit at the 2025 UAP Dubai Design Awards, said CvSU-CEIT Dean Willie Buclatin.

The thesis, authored by Maria Lucille Faustino and Jho-Ar Rupido, is titled “Unboxed 360: An Unenclosed Biocontainment Facility Design of the Philippine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (PH CDC) Integrated with Vertical Medical Park.”

It presents a bold and innovative reimagining of medical infrastructure in the Philippines — blending public health functionality with sustainable architectural design. It exemplifies a visionary approach to future-ready healthcare facilities.

The international recognition highlights the growing global presence of CvSU architecture graduates, and also raises the bar on how design research can influence community wellbeing and national development.

The UAP Design Awards 2025 is a black-tie, red carpet gala night organized by the United Architects of the Philippines-Dubai Chapter. It is a dynamic community of Filipino architects that champion innovation, creativity, and design excellence across the region.

The event gathered over 200 architects, juries and special invitees from the Middle East and beyond. It is a platform that fosters networking opportunities and honors outstanding design professionals from various creative industries.

Proceeds from the event support a public school project in the Philippines.

In its first edition, it handed over donations to Barangay Tibag in Bulacan.

‘Supernatural' fans will soon witness a long-anticipated on-screen reunion as Jensen Ackles expressed enthusiasm over once again collaborating with former co-stars Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins in the concluding season of ‘The Boys'.

In a recent interview with People, Ackles opened up about his enduring friendship with Padalecki and Collins, saying, “We see each other more often than you would think — honestly, at least once a month.”

Reflecting on the recent experience of having both actors visit and work with him on the set, he shared, “It was weird. It was like inviting my friends over to somebody else's house for dinner. I was like, ‘Listen, guys, don't make me look bad. I got to stay here.' They were amazing. I can't wait to talk more about it because it was quite an experience.”

The possibility of Padalecki joining the Prime Video series gained traction after Kripke publicly expressed his desire to work with the actor on 'The Boys' final season. Padalecki confirmed to Deadline last June that he was open to the idea. “The answer is yes,” he said, signalling his willingness to reunite with his former showrunner and co-star.

The fourth season of ‘The Boys', which is currently airing, also saw the arrival of another ‘Supernatural' alumnus. Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who portrayed the Winchester brothers' father in the earlier seasons of the CW series, made a memorable appearance as Joe Kessler — a hallucination tormenting Karl Urban's Billy Butcher.

This week, Kripke marked the end of principal photography on The Boys' finale with a heartfelt message on social media. “It's bittersweet, but my primary feeling is gratitude,” he wrote. “We have the best cast, the best crew, the most fun story to write, and something that is impossible to predict: the right timing. You wait your whole career to have maybe two of those things, if you're lucky. We got all of them.”

This reunion would not only serve as a nostalgic moment for long-time viewers of ‘Supernatural', but also a fitting culmination to Kripke's two most iconic genre-bending series.

Ackles, who starred as Dean Winchester for 15 seasons alongside Padalecki's Sam Winchester in Eric Kripke's cult CW series ‘Supernatural' (2005–2020), joined ‘The Boys' in its third season as Soldier Boy. Since then, The Boys has continued to attract a growing audience, with Kripke, the showrunner, now preparing to bring the story to a close with its upcoming fifth season.

As production wraps and anticipation builds for the fifth and final season of The Boys, fans will be watching closely for any official announcements confirming the reunion that genre television enthusiasts have long awaited.

These are very good support for the ‘teleport' archetype 😀 !

most of the teleport spells you want to set are quick play so that kind of limits things

You could set the new report fusion and activate during your opponent's turn

Yea this is less of a combo bridge and more of a semi-generic setup for an interruption via teleport fusion or parallel teleport. it's quite strong for a 6 tho as thats a synchro level that usually doesn't provide particulatly strong payoffs.

Yes!!! more main deck support next

There are no good Teleport Normal Spells, so unless we have a third wave coming that is almost pointless.

You can set Parallel Teleport and tribute the Sorceress for trigger her bounce effect, so not is pointless at all

you can also set assault teleport if you want to go the assault mode route

holy shi that synchro noo but the fusion too, this support is… really good i might get to cooking

Oracle is no doubt super poly option

Are the materials wrong for the fusion or is the 1st effect wrong?
it gains 1000 ATK for each Synchro, Xyz, and Link Monster used as its material.

That makes it seem like you can use multiple materials. The way the materials are written it seems like it's 1 extra deck monster or am I reading them wrong?

The Psychic material can also be a Synchro Xyz or Link. The new Synchro even rewards you for doing so because she sets Teleport Fusion and when sent to the GY can bounce up to 2 cards.

Looks like Serene Psychic Witch finally got her upgraded form and it further increases the interruption plays this new support Wave can dish out. 

The new Axon Kicker having a good target now is also kinda important.

the translation is correct, it can only gain 1k or 2k

So one recovers super poly and bounces 1-2 cards while other works with super poly and recovers itself with the same super poly. Like 2-3 of each would work even.

Teleport quick play, not any quickplay.

These are good but i wish they made a level 12 psychic synchro

I'm a bit disappointed that they didn't make Oracle like Dark Magician of Destruction.  As in, limits on the summoning, but no HOPT.  It'd have been nice to put pressure on destruction because it'd come back with a renewed summon negate.

Was hoping we'd get Myutant support to represent Psychic Fusion in this set.

The Lakefront Psychic and Holistic Festival returns to the Walter F. Bruce VFW Post 1145 in St. Clair Shores July 11-13 and offers healing for mind, body and spirit.

“This is considered to be a healing and fun event,” said organizer Laura Moody, president of Rock Your World Events. “The event is body, mind and spirit and you have to have them all in balance to have a good life.

“If the body isn't doing well, the mind and the spirit get down.”

The setting itself on the shores of Lake St. Clair is very healing. Many people spend some time sitting by the shore during the three-day festival enjoying food from one of the food trucks or just listening to music.

There will be psychics, mediums, astrologers, tarot card readers, reiki healers, reflexologists and massage therapists. Vendors will be selling organic herbs and soaps, crystals, books and many other wares.

“The healing of the mind can come with the readings; you get an uplifted reading and you are feeling better about your life,” said Moody, who will be doing pet readings. “The reiki is the spirit stuff that works on the whole aura of you.

“No matter where people are at, whatever they are working on, we have something for them.”

New this year is a crystal wire wrapping class where people can choose a crystal and create a pendant that can be worn as a necklace. There will be classes at noon on Saturday and Sunday and $30 gets you admission to the event and the class.

“All of the materials are there and you can pick a crystal that speaks to you and walk out wearing a pendant that you have made,” said Moody. “It is a beautiful wrap and very sophisticated.”

Music by headliner Nashville singer-songwriter Shanna in a Dress, Michigan musician Rob Crozier as well as local acoustic artists will fill the airwaves throughout the weekend.

Tickets are $6 for Friday, July 11, and $10 for Saturday, July 12, and Sunday, July 13, but if tickets are purchased online at www.rywevents.com the $10 tickets are 2-for-1. Tickets can also be purchased at the door, but the special pricing is only available online. There are weekend passes available for $16. Children 12 and under get free admission.

“This is a family event and even if you are not into getting a reading, you can come and shop and listen to music and sit by the lake,” Moody said.

The event will take place at the Walter F. Bruce VFW Post #1145, 28404 Jefferson Avenue, St. Clair Shores, Michigan, 48081 on Friday, July 11, from 3 p.m. – 9 p.m., Saturday, July 12, and Sunday, July 13, from 10 a.m. – 6 p.m.

All individual readings and service sessions are offered at a reasonable cost in addition to general admission.

Kandiss Taylor, a congressional candidate from Georgia and supporter of President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, faced criticism for a social media post Saturday in which she shared conspiracy theories about the recent deadly flash floods along Texas's Guadalupe River.

In a post on the social platform X, Taylor, who is currently campaigning for a House seat in Georgia, wrote: ""FAKE WEATHER. REAL DAMAGE."" 

She added: ""Hurricane Helene left me powerless for 16 days & caused $57K in damage. This isn't just 'climate change.' It's cloud seeding, geoengineering, & manipulation. If fake weather causes real tragedy, that's murder. Pray. Prepare. Question the narrative.""

Hurricane Helene struck Florida in September of last year, unleashing devastating flooding, powerful winds, and triggering numerous landslides throughout the southeastern U.S. The storm's strength was intensified by unusually warm ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean, a condition linked to ongoing climate change and not cloud seeding..

The congressional candidate's remarks denying climate change in light of the deadly flash floods in Texas were strongly criticized on social media.

Former Congressman Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill) reacted to her post and said: ""Hey Texas. What do you think of this? She's running for congress as a Republican? Any thoughts?""

""To politicize such devastating events with no basic knowledge of weather processes is disgraceful to the millions of families impacted,"" wrote another X user in response to Taylor's post.

""I can't believe these people walk among us. Truly frightening,"" said another user in a post.

Meanwhile, MAGA-aligned Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) announced on Saturday her intention to propose legislation targeting “weather modification.”

“I am introducing a bill that prohibits the injection, release, or dispersion of chemicals or substances into the atmosphere for the express purpose of altering weather, temperature, climate, or sunlight intensity. It will be a felony offense,” she stated in a post on X.

The Comet Ping Pong Pizzagate shooting, the plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and a man's livestreamed beheading of his father last year were all fueled by conspiracy theories. But while the headlines suggest that conspiratorial thinking is on the rise, this is not the case. Research points to no increase in conspiratorial thinking. Still, to a more dangerous reality: the conspiracies taking hold and being amplified by political ideologues are increasingly correlated with violence against particular groups. Fortunately, promising new research points to actions we can take to reduce conspiratorial thinking in communities across the US.

Some journalists claim that this is “a golden age of conspiracy theories,” and the public agrees. As of 2022, 59% of Americans think that people are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories today than 25 years ago, and 73% of Americans think conspiracy theories are “out of control.” Most blame this perceived increase on the role of social media and the internet.

But these headlines misunderstand the crisis: belief in conspiracy theories is not on the rise. Dr. Joseph Uscinski, an expert on conspiracy theories at the University of Miami who has tracked their prevalence and effects for close to two decades, finds no increase in levels of conspiratorial thinking. Others echo his findings: a study by Uscinski and researchers from the US and UK found no increase in conspiratorial beliefs in the US (or in six European countries, for that matter) from the 1960s through 2020. For instance, only about 5% of Americans believe in Q-Anon, and positive feelings towards Q-Anon have not increased since 2018. In fact, belief decreased rather than increased in most of the conspiracy theories examined. Most conspiracy theories pop up and burn out quickly. Those that take hold for a number of years are the exception.

What is growing is the link between believing in conspiracies and justifying or committing violence against particular groups or political opponents. A 2024 study found that between 2012 and 2022, the correlation between support for political violence and conspiratorial thinking tripled in magnitude–– but researchers don't know why. Researchers do know that “fringe” conspiracy beliefs––less popular beliefs held by more homogenous groups––tend to correlate more strongly with political violence. Specifically, Holocaust denialism and false flag theories (conspiracies that suggest that attacks or events were staged by one group and pinned on another, such as that school shootings are staged by professional actors) are particularly strongly correlated with support for political violence. Experts suggest that this growing link is perhaps due to violent people more often turning to conspiracies to justify their violent actions. Committing violence may not be such a leap for Holocaust deniers who are already willing to entertain violent thoughts outside the mainstream. Meanwhile, violent individuals might believe they are justified in acting on false flag conspiracies when those beliefs are normalized and amplified by political ideologues–– as with assertions that the FBI perpetrated the January 6th insurrection.



Conspiratorial thinking doesn't make people violent. Instead, it directs violent people towards particular targets, channeling violence against groups like Jews, Muslims, and the LGBTQ+ community. The 2017 Charlottesville protesters, decrying “Jews will not replace us,” echoed the Great Replacement Theory and Jewish world domination conspiracies. Conspiracies have also become a justification for militant Accelerationists, a group that advocates destroying economic, political, and societal systems to hasten the downfall of societies and rebuild them in their image. In the 2018 Tree of Life Shooting, the assailant killed 11 congregants because he believed the synagogue was systematically bringing in immigrants to replace White Americans. Additionally, as seen in the examples above, attitude generalization causes prejudice against one group––say, from a conspiracy theory focused on Jews––to increase prejudice towards other groups, such as Asians, Muslims, and the LGBTQ+ community.

Encouragingly, some successful interventions are emerging. Promising new research had people who believe in conspiracies discuss their beliefs with artificial intelligence, large language models. Participants knew they were interacting with AI, and yet the interaction reduced belief in their chosen conspiracy theories by 20%, with the effect lasting at least two months. This debunking even spilled over into participants' belief in other conspiracies, leading to a general decrease in conspiratorial thinking. That makes sense: conspiratorial thinking is more of a belief system (i.e. blaming secret plots spearheaded by elites or malign groups to explain events in opposition to evidence presented by bodies of experts), rather than a belief in just one conspiracy. Interestingly, receiving information from an AI bot may work better than human interventions, because believers feel judged by people, get defensive, and dig in. With an AI bot, they can ask for and receive facts without the emotions that come from feeling attacked. This might cause participants to be less defensive, perceive less bias, and use more analytical thinking.

Additionally, researchers found that having one to four strong social connections reduces the likelihood of supporting or engaging in political violence. Work in other areas of targeted violence suggests that family intervention encourages change in these beliefs. Methods such as these could prove effective for changing the minds of those who believe in conspiracy theories and keeping those who hold violent conspiracies from taking the next step into action. Combined with this promising new AI intervention, there may be a real chance to blunt the impact of conspiracy theories on targeted groups.

Peggy Noonan has been a voice of conservative reflection for The Wall Street Journal since leaving the Ronald Reagan administration as his primary speechwriter. Five of Noonan's books have been New York Times bestsellers. Consuming every word of her weekly column keeps me politically balanced.

In her June 14-15 column titled “America is losing sight of its political culture,” she referred to and elaborated on our 47th president being America's Mr. Tinpot Dictator. This phrase, often used to describe a leader who acts like a dictator, with delusions of grandeur and authoritarian tendencies, struck a chord. Following the title about Mr. Trump, I pursued investigative research on the topic.



























U.S. President Joe Biden speaks at the Economic Club of Washington, DC September 19, 2024 in Washington, DC.

Ever since the reality of President Biden's mental and physical decline has been made public, ink is being spent, bemoaning that the nation was at risk because the President was not fit to make crucial decisions twenty-four hours a day. 

Isn't it foolish that, in a constitutional republic with clear separation and interdependence of powers, we should rely on one human being to make a decision at three in the morning that could have grievous consequences for the whole nation and the world? Are we under the illusion that we must and can elect an all-wise, always-on, energizer-bunny, superhero?



























Trump's reliance on inflammatory, and often dehumanizing, language is not an unfortunate quirk—it's a deliberate tactic.

When President Trump declared that the U.S. strikes “obliterated” Iran's nuclear program, it wasn't just a policy claim—it was an exercise in narrative control. Predictably, his assertion was met with both support and skepticism. Yet more than a comment on military efficacy, the statement falls into a broader pattern that underscores how Trump uses language not just to communicate but to dominate.

Alongside top officials like CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Trump claimed the strikes set Iran's nuclear ambitions back by years. However, conflicting intelligence assessments tell a more nuanced story. A leaked Defense Intelligence Agency report concluded that while infrastructure was damaged and entrances sealed, core components such as centrifuges remained largely intact. Iran had already relocated much of its enriched uranium. The International Atomic Energy Agency echoed that damage was reparable.



















Tesla CEO Elon Musk listens as U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on May 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. 

The recent breakup, breakdown, and reconciliation of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk is on full global display. It's the kind of relationship chaos many hope to never experience. But if you know, you know.

Here is the short version: two work partners got into a disagreement and said hurtful things. The one with his name on the lease kicked the partner out on the streets. In fits of rage, each turned to social media and proceeded to drag each other through the mud by sharing either dark secrets or disparaging accusations. Then they apparently make up: Musk apologizes and Trump accepts.

Ben Shelton launched a public plea for his sister to get some extra time off from her job at investment bank Morgan Stanley so she could remain at Wimbledon to cheer for him. It worked.

After advancing to face Italy's Lorenzo Sonego on Monday in the fourth round, Shelton spoke in an on-court interview in front of a crowd that included his sister, Emma, and his girlfriend, U.S. national soccer team star Trinity Rodman.

""I've been playing well this week. It's not just been me here. I have a great team. My parents are here. My girlfriend's here. Also, my sister's here. She's been here for every match that I've played this tournament so far. She's been the lucky charm,"" said the 10th-seeded Shelton, a 22-year-old American who has appeared in two Grand Slam semifinals. ""But she has work back in the U.S., starting on Monday. She works for Morgan Stanley.""

That drew some boos from spectators as Emma covered her face with her hands.

""If any of you all have some (connections) and get her a couple extra days off so she can (stay and) we can keep this rolling,"" Shelton continued after his 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-2 victory over Marton Fucsovics of Hungary on Saturday, ""that'd be great.""

Sure enough, hours later, Emma posted a short video on Instagram in which Ben is heard asking her, ""You got the week off or what?"" She jumps up and down with her arms raised and a wide smile, and Ben says, ""Shoutout, Morgan Stanley.""

The caption reads ""thank you MS"" with three blue heart emojis and ""return flight: cancelled.""

Ben Shelton, who won all nine sets he played in Week 1 at the All England Club, beat Sonego in the Australian Open quarterfinals in January.
