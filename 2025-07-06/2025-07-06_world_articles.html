Faisal Kamran, a police official, said the woman and her five- and seven-year-old children sustained injuries to their faces and arms on Wednesday night when the lion escaped from its cage. Keeping exotic animals such as lions is considered a status symbol by some wealthy Pakistanis, despite the legal requirements and high fees associated with ownership. According to the BirGün newspaper, the lion attacked an agricultural worker called Suleiman Kir who was asleep in a pistachio field with his wife. Kir tussled with the lion before it ran off. “We were covered with blankets to protect ourselves from mosquitoes and when the prayer call sounded, I tried to stand up but I couldn't,” he told the newspaper. “We called for help but there was no one around. At that moment, the security forces came,” he said. Antalya's governor said the lion had been tracked down and shot dead. He indicated that an investigation had been opened into the incident. BirGün said there were about 30 big cats at the Land of Lions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lando Norris won a chaotic British Grand Prix on Sunday, safely navigating a rain-hit race punctuated by several safety cars and taking advantage of his teammate Oscar Piastri incurring a 10-second penalty when one of those safety cars pulled off the track. Norris only led for the last few laps at Silverstone, having remained largely anonymous for much of the race. “It's beautiful,” he told broadcaster Sky Sports afterward. Everything I have ever wanted to achieve. “This is where it all started for me, was actually watching you on TV many years ago. And now, thankfully, I've been able to have my go.” By finishing first, Norris closed the gap to Piastri in the drivers' world championship and is now only eight points behind his teammate. Piastri held on for second while Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg claimed his first ever F1 podium in his 239th race, despite starting in 19th on the grid. “What a race, coming from virtually last,” he told Sky Sports. From the very start, it was an action-packed race with Mercedes' George Russell and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc among those pitting to change their tires before the race began. On pole, Max Verstappen started cleanly but, behind him, Liam Lawson and Esteban Ocon collided, sending Lawson spinning off the track and causing a virtual safety car to be deployed. As soon as that virtual safety car ended, another one started when Gabriel Bortoleto had to abandon his car as he tried to limp back to the pits. Once that one finished, and the racing got going, Verstappen and Piastri battled for first place – Verstappen ducking and weaving all over the track to defend his position, though ultimately Piastri passed the Red Bull driver relatively easily. Rain began falling shortly afterwards and, after complaining about his tires not gripping the track, Verstappen slid wide, letting Norris through as well. All top three drivers pitted shortly afterward but Norris endured a slow pit stop, conceding second place back to Verstappen. Then, as the race got back underway, visibility remained so poor that Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar accidentally drove into the back of Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli, crumpling the Frenchman's car and causing yet another safety car to come out. Led by Piastri, with Verstappen close behind, the drivers bunched up again. As the safety car began pulling off, Piastri started trying to outfox Verstappen but he braked so sharply that the Dutchman accidentally overtook him. Then, Piastri accelerated away and Verstappen spun out trying to match the Australian, slipping from second to 10th place. “Apparently you can't brake behind the safety car anymore.” Although Piastri remained running out front, his days as the race leader were numbered as he was unable to build up an advantage of more than 10 seconds over Norris. Eventually, McLaren pitted him and Norris took the lead, becoming tearful over the radio when he won his home race. This story has been updated with additional developments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid's FIFA Club World Cup quarter-final against Borussia Dortmund had taken three crazy turns during nine minutes of second-half stoppage time when Marcel Sabitzer chested the ball and sent a right-footed volley toward Thibaut Courtois' post. Sabitzer turned his back to the goal and put both hands on his head as Brazilian referee Ramon Abatti walked by, raised both hands and blew the final whistle. Voted the top goalkeeper in 2018, Courtois has won a pair of UEFA Champions League titles with Real Madrid, along with two English Premier League championships and four in La Liga. “We are so lucky that we have Thibaut on goal because Thibaut is one of those ‘keepers that makes you win games, and today that save has been so decisive,” Madrid coach Xabi Alonso said. Gonzalo Garcia is tying Benfica's Angel Di Maria and Al Hilal's Marcos Leonardo for the tournament lead with four goals. “Not even in my best dreams did I think it would go this well,” said the 21-year-old Gonzalo Garcia, who played just five La Liga matches over the past two seasons. Real Madrid's lead still stood when five minutes of stoppage time were signaled. Dortmund's Maximilian Beier started the zaniness when he scored three minutes into stoppage time after Antonio Rudiger's failed clearance. Kylian Mbappe, who entered in the 67th minute, restored a two-goal lead one minute later with a spectacular bicycle kick, beating goalkeeper Gregor Kobel from 6 yards from Arda Guler's long cross. Mbappe then held up two fingers with his right hand and formed a zero with his left as a tribute to Diogo Jota, flashing the No. 20 of the Liverpool player who died in a car crash on Thursday. Serhou Guirassy converted a penalty kick in the eighth minute of added time after he was fouled by Dean Huijsen, who received a red card and would miss the semi-final. Courtois then came up with a stop for the ages. Madrid advanced to a semi-final match against Champions League winner Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, a day after Chelsea meets the Brazilian club Fluminense. Spain are the favorites to win the UEFA Women's Euro 2025, but star player Aitana Bonmati's illness ahead of the tournament raises another question mark around a side which, despite their obvious quality, are not unstoppable. Bonmati was discharged on Sunday and joined up with In the women's doubles, Taiwan's Hsieh Su-wei was to play in the second round last night, but Taiwan's Ray Ho exited in the men's doubles                                        It is more than 10 years since Grigor Dimitrov reached his sole Wimbledon semi-final and back then it still seemed a reasonable bet that the Bulgarian once dubbed “Baby Federer” would win a Grand Slam title. There were semi-final runs at the US Open and Australian Open after that, but it has never quite happened and despite him still being ranked No. Chan Hao-ching and Wu Fang-hsien and their partners won their first-round matches in the women's doubles at the All England Lawn Tennis Club                                        Late-night finishes and five-set matches are becoming a habit for Taylor Fritz at Wimbledon this year. On Wednesday, he wrapped up his win over Gabriel Diallo before the match was suspended — making sure the fifth-seeded American would not have to come back on court for a fourth straight day. Fritz overcame a bloodied elbow to win 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/0), 4-6, 6-3 on No. Chelsea scored the go-ahead goal on Malo Gusto's 83rd-minute shot that went in after a pair of deflections, beating Palmeiras 2-1 on Friday night for a spot in the FIFA Club World Cup semi-finals. Gusto's shot following a short corner kick appeared to deflect off defender Agustin Giay and goalkeeper Weverton and sent the Chelsea portion of 65,782 fans into a frenzy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Desire Doue scored in the 78th minute, and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) moved a step closer to another trophy with a 2-0 victory over Bayern Munich in the quarter-final of the FIFA Club World Cup on Saturday, a game marred by a gruesome injury to young German star Jamal Musiala. With PSG two men down after a pair of late red cards and Bayern throwing everyone forward, Ousmane Dembele added an insurance goal deep into stoppage time to send the French powerhouse to the semi-finals on Wednesday against Real Madrid following their 3-2 win over Borussia Dortmund. Dembele, whose goal was set up by Achraf Hakimi's brilliant dribbling through five Bayern defenders, celebrated by sitting with his legs crossed to honor Liverpool player Diogo Jota, who was killed along with his brother in a car wreck early on Thursday. A moment of silence was held before the opening kick. His left-footed shot caught Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer flat-footed as it skidded inside the right post. However, PSG had to hold on for dear life to preserve the win after Willian Pacho and Lucas Hernandez were both sent off with red cards. Bayern had two apparent goals flagged for offside, including a header by Kane. In the waning seconds, the German club was awarded a penalty kick, only to have it waved off after a video assistant referee review. As he chased a loose ball near the end line in first-half stoppage time, PSG ‘keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma darted off his spot and dived for it — only to crash into the left ankle of the 22-year-old German. As Musiala rolled over, his foot dangled awkwardly, the ankle appearing to be cleanly broken. A stretcher was immediately summoned to take Musiala off the field. “I've rarely been so angry at half-time, not against my players. There's many things in life that are important, much more important than this, but in the end, for these guys, it's their life,” Kompany said. I understand this is football, but it's the fact that it happened to someone who, one, enjoys the game so much but also very important for us,” he added. Spain are the favorites to win the UEFA Women's Euro 2025, but star player Aitana Bonmati's illness ahead of the tournament raises another question mark around a side which, despite their obvious quality, are not unstoppable. Bonmati was discharged on Sunday and joined up with In the women's doubles, Taiwan's Hsieh Su-wei was to play in the second round last night, but Taiwan's Ray Ho exited in the men's doubles                                        It is more than 10 years since Grigor Dimitrov reached his sole Wimbledon semi-final and back then it still seemed a reasonable bet that the Bulgarian once dubbed “Baby Federer” would win a Grand Slam title.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The death toll from flash floods that rampaged through Central Texas rose to at least 67 on Sunday as rescuers maneuvering through challenging terrain found more bodies and continued their desperate search for many others, including 11 missing girls from a summer camp. Searchers in Kerr County have found 16 bodies since Saturday afternoon, bringing the total number of dead there to 59, said Sheriff Larry Leitha. He pledged to keep searching in that Hill Country region until “everybody is found” from Friday's flash floods. Rescuers scoured a central Texas landscape of mangled trees, overturned cars and muck-filled debris on Sunday in an increasingly bleak mission to locate survivors after a historic flash flood. Rescuers dealt with broken trees, overturned cars and muck-filled debris in the difficult task to find survivors. Families were allowed to look around the camp Sunday morning while nearby crews operating heavy equipment pulled tree trunks and tangled branches out of the water as they searched along a riverbank. At one point, the pair doubled over, sobbing before they embraced. Authorities faced growing questions about whether enough warnings were issued in area long vulnerable to flooding and whether enough preparations were made. The destructive, fast-moving waters rose eight metres on the river in only 45 minutes before daybreak Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as flash flood watches remained in effect and more rain fell in central Texas on Sunday. Officials said more than 850 people were rescued in the first 36 hours.

He declared Sunday a day of prayer for the state. In Rome, Pope Leo XIV offered special prayers for those touched by the disaster. Survivors shared terrifying stories of being swept away and clinging to trees as rampaging floodwaters carried trees and cars past them. Others fled to attics inside their homes, praying the water wouldn't reach them.

Authorities and elected officials have said they did not expect such an intense downpour, the equivalent of months' worth of rain for the area. U.S. Representative Chip Roy, whose district includes the ravaged area, acknowledged that there would be second-guessing and finger-pointing as people look for someone to blame.

Schools and other organizations serving undocumented students are taking their activities underground, fearful of revealing all they do to help newcomers navigate life in America — lest they be targeted and shuttered by the Trump administration. Some have asked staff to use secure messaging systems like Signal instead of text and email to keep sensitive conversations from public reach. Others say such discussions should happen only over the phone. “Because of the threats from the federal administration about revoking the 501(c)(3) status of nonprofits, we want to keep ourselves from being targeted,” said one man who asked not to be identified because he works for an organization that serves undocumented youth. Groups like his can lose their IRS status, which allows them to collect tax-deductible donations, if they engage in political activities. “Anything that could be perceived as obstructing or challenging federal immigration policies, we don't put in writing,” he said. “Anything that could be seen as a criticism of the administration — or anything that could be seen as partisan — we're going to completely avoid.” An administrator for a small Illinois school district that serves mostly Hispanic children said that while it still provides help to all families — including connecting them to rental and tax-preparation assistance — staff are more guarded about publicizing their efforts. Any high-profile association between the school and these types of services can be a flag to their families' immigration status. “I don't want any light shining on our district.” Her fears around immigration were heightened in February, she said, when she received two letters addressed to her office from the Department of Homeland Security, asking for the whereabouts of two children. I did not respond in terms of providing the information and so far, nobody has followed up.” Those early efforts took place just weeks after President Donald Trump returned to office and are among the administration's first known attempts to target and locate undocumented children. Reports of federal agents undertaking welfare checks on young immigrants who crossed the border unaccompanied did not surface until months later. And they said school-sponsored events, like a normally well-attended spring family night for the parents of English learners, have been nearly empty — or worse, cancelled — since Trump took office and immigrants avoid large gatherings. “Fulfilling your mission, doing the things that took you to this work, standing for your principles, that's what each of us should do.” And while Trump has threatened Harvard University with the loss of its 501(c)(3) status, the Nonprofit Alliance notes his powers are limited, though House Republicans are seeking their expansion. Whether Trump's threats are idle or actual, their impact has changed how immigrant-focused entities operate. Barbara Marler, a long-time educator-turned-consultant in Illinois, has worked with newcomer students for decades. She's now offering school districts and other education-focused clients the option of combing through their records to find and erase any DEI-related terms an AI bot could flag as troublesome. Such wording could trigger Freedom of Information requests that Marler described as “nefarious” and one school administrator, already inundated by them, deemed harassment. “Never, in my career of over 40 years, have I felt the need to do this,” said Marler, adding that a majority of school districts in vocal, right-leaning communities feel compelled to adopt these precautions. “They want to do right by their [English learners], but are worried that legal challenges would bankrupt them in the worst-case scenario — or board meeting harassment would be triggered in the best-case scenario.” Alejandra Vázquez Baur, a fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and director of the National Newcomer Network, notes most of the people who work for organizations that serve immigrants want to draw attention to children and families who've historically been cast aside. “We know exactly what it feels like to feel ostracized by a system that was not built for us,” she said. Some groups, including those that operate inside immigrant-friendly states or cities, with big budgets and robust legal defense, might feel emboldened to push back, she said. But small organizations, particularly those run by immigrants, who might themselves be undocumented or whose staff have mixed status, can't afford that risk. Trump himself was forced to close his own 501(c)(3), a private foundation established in 1987, as part of a 2018 settlement after his family was found to have used money earmarked for charity to further the president's political campaign. Trump, who was ordered to pay $2 million in damages, called the investigation “harassment.” Antero Godina Garcia, professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Education, said even a public retreat in name only by those groups that serve immigrants marks a loss for the community. He worries that it will shrink these organizations' reach and the families they assist will have fewer places where their identities are recognized and affirmed. “It is not just less services and opportunities for these communities, but also a broader erosion of how individuals can see themselves as valued within the social fabric of this country,” he said. “It gets complicated because things that we think are normal and are legal, such as offering know-your-rights training, the administration could easily perceive that as obstructing their policies, making them hostile to us,” he said. As for the written footprint, Marler, who has attended numerous conferences on how best to serve multilingual learners, has observed a telling shift in the types of in-class translating applications marketed to teachers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Forest protectors are defending mature forests from logging after dam removal and restoration on the Elwha River. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. Here on land owned by the state's Department of Natural Resources (DNR), a beautiful mature forest has been logged for hardwood, plywood, and other wood products. Hacked-off stumps are visible in all directions, a few trees left to stand. The former forest floor, once rich with organisms and nutrients that fed life, now stands heaped into huge slash piles to be burned. The land doused with herbicide to kill any competitors to Douglas fir seedlings that will become a new tree plantation monoculture. There, in naturally regenerated forests more than a century old, large Douglas fir, western red cedar and big-leaf maple trees festooned with moss and licorice ferns surround you. Native sword ferns, trillium, salal, red huckleberry, lichen, and other native vegetation in multiple shades of brilliant green abound. After DNR put more Elwha legacy forest on the chopping block during a November 2024 auction, environmentalists, citizens, and forest defenders are fighting to stop Murphy's logging there through lawsuits and direct action. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. The sit received broad support through encampments, rallies, and continuous supply efforts from community members. “Our commitment to defend the forests and waters of the Olympic Peninsula remains strong,” states an OFD press release. The dam builder didn't bother to include legally required mechanisms for fish passage. Ninety-three percent of the upstream salmon spawning habitat was cut off, leading to near extirpation of pristine populations of wild salmon in the river that was central to the Lower Elwha people's life and culture. Under tribal pressure that spanned generations, a $325 million project was launched in 2011 by tribal, governmental, and academic agencies and scientists to restore the river ecosystem by removing the dams; restoring the river's flow; planting native plants; and building back the populations of five species of Pacific salmon, steelhead, and other species. The dams were finally taken down in the years between 2011 and 2014 — more than 20 years after a 1992 Congressional Act ordered it. The river returned to natural channels after dam removal, and after a few years of major sediment release, it began to clear. It also explains the deep feelings held among tribal members, Forest Defenders, conservationists, and others who care about the land and river ecosystem. A petition circulated in October 2024 by Lower Elwha tribe members and signed by over half of the members of the tribe, as well as 2,500 other people, states that, We do not understand a way of thinking that would spend hundreds of millions on Elwha River restoration but continue to industrially log in that same watershed. We do not understand a way of thinking that takes too much and says it is never enough; that would disrespect a River that gives us so much life and now hope. Our ancestral knowledge and sacred obligation to the natural world teaches us a different path. We ask you to stop these planned timber sales and heed our call to be guided by principles of respect and reciprocity in caring for the watershed. Upthegrove had pledged to protect legacy forests if elected. The Tree Well and Parched logging plans threaten to cut over 300 acres of mature legacy conifer forest, some of which has never been logged. The two forest sites are critical to carbon sequestration and as habitat for wildlife and culturally significant native plants. The lawsuit also argues scientific studies have shown logging negatively impacts stream flows, hydrology, and water temperature — all factors critical to supporting the Elwha system and its salmon populations, which in turn support populations of the critically endangered southern resident orcas. LFCD is suing for injunctive relief against the sale of the forests on the basis that the DNR is neglecting to follow its own policies to regenerate old-growth forest on 10-15 percent of state forestlands — a legal approach that has successfully paused other DNR timber sales. Collectively, these timber sales threaten over 2,300 acres of biodiverse and carbon-dense legacy forests across western Washington.” Truthout also spoke to LaTrisha Suggs, a restoration planner for, and enrolled member of, the Jamestown S'Klallam tribe. Her family has lived for time immemorial in Clallam County. Suggs is also a Port Angeles City Council member who worked as a restoration planner for the Lower Elwha tribe on the river restoration project. Her declaration also stated that Port Angeles has been under a stage three water shortage each summer since 2022, and Clallam County has been under a drought advisory for years — issues expected to get worse as climate change advances. Elizabeth Dunne is ELC's director of legal advocacy. Dunne and the coalition's successful efforts to stop a prior timber sale in the Elwha has been told in an award-winning short film, Last Stand, Saving the Elwha River's Legacy Forests. She shared a map with Truthout showing that greater than 50 percent of the Elwha's legacy forests have been logged in just the last 17 years; little older forest remains in the Elwha watershed. Now DNR has plans for logging 800 more acres. “The Elwha River is really speaking for many of these ecosystems that are suffering at the hands of over-extraction and exploitation for profit without having any kind of sense of responsibility of the balance that we need to show back to the Earth if we are going to continue to survive as a species. And not just survive but be able to thrive,” Dunne said. In early May, Murphy began building roads into the Parched timber units, tearing down trees and bringing in gravel. The tree-sit involved a cable pulley stretched from logs and other debris blocking the middle of the logging road connected to a “dunk tank”-type platform 60-80 feet up a nearby large grand fir tree. “There's a long history in the Pacific Northwest of direct action and tree-sitting being effective, especially when done in conjunction with some sort of legal pressure,” Fable told Truthout. Fable told Truthout that they had studied math to get a master's degree, but their recent experience of caretaking for a loved one who was sick changed their life. The experience “made me want to be more involved in things that actually make change in the world,” they said. “Realistically, the most good you can do is caring for people and caring for land, and keeping people and land safe from the really evil things that are out there.” They would at times try to stop people from going in or threaten them with arrest. “The support's been great and kind of surprising,” Fable said. “People understand how critical of a moment this is and that this kind of action is necessary, which really gives me a lot of hope because that's how I feel. After the tree-sit began, Land Commissioner Upthegrove, who placed a six-month pause on logging legacy forests, condemned the sitters saying, “This stunt is dangerous, reckless and counterproductive…. This kind of dangerous vandalism makes it harder to advance a positive environmental agenda.” We are here helping him keep his promise.” Upthegrove's threats ignited phone calls and emails to his office, including from some who had worked for him because of his campaign pledges. Nonetheless on May 28, he doubled down on threats to the Forest Defenders, saying, “We intend to hold those responsible accountable.” A statement on DNR's website says Upthegrove is reassessing the process on legacy forests, but that, “Some paused sales could be reconfigured and brought forward to auction once the criteria to exclude structurally complex forests that are critical to carbon storage and habitat biodiversity are developed.” Upthegrove also said he's committed to protect sales approved before he took office, saying, “It's important to defend policies and the authority of the agency.” It's unclear what DNR will do after the six-month “pause” in legacy forest sales ends. In a letter to Clallam County Democrats, Upthegrove said he intended to bring forward a policy to protect 77,000 acres of older forests, a significant step if done, though less than the 106,000 acres of legacy forest currently unprotected. He claimed, without evidence, that the tree-sit had endangered DNR employees. After first ordering a two-week injunction against logging and compelling DNR to produce administrative records supporting its decision to approve the timber sales, a Clallam County Superior Court judge refused to extend the injunction past May 23. On June 6, she ruled against an LFDC filing which sought to prevent logging until both lawsuits could receive a full hearing on their merits. Hearings on the merits should be held in coming months. Dunne told Truthout that she was disappointed in the judge's ruling. “Existing policies aside, what we need today is action commensurate with the gravity of the extinction and biodiversity crisis: a clear directive creating an Ecological Forest Reserve and permanently protecting all remaining legacy forests on state lands for their intrinsic value and as essential to the survival of all species,” she said. Vigilantes also drunkenly threatened to kill the Forest Defenders and threw bottles around. “Dave Upthegrove ran as a progressive, and that's kind of the first and main legislator we're pushing back against right now. I don't know that we would have done things any different if there weren't these sort of executive orders (like Trump's on timber sales) going into place, and this sort of over-escalation and fascism in our country … and is giving people hope that even under a really threatening administration, we can keep pushing back against it,” Fable told Truthout.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four Alliance 90/Greens party members have sent an open letter to German Chancellor Friedrich Merz calling for a significant increase in military aid to Ukraine, Bild reported on July 5, citing a copy of the document. The letter's authors — Robin Wagener, Sara Nanni, Sebastian Schafer, and Anton Hofreiter — demanded that certain budget items be adjusted, particularly regarding support for Ukraine. "Without further air defense and assured supplies, Russian dictatorship over Ukraine becomes more likely," the letter read. The lawmakers also noted that the situation has deteriorated as Russia continues to carry out large-scale attacks on Ukraine, and the United States, for its part, has partially suspended its military aid. Before becoming chancellor, Merz, elected for the CDU/CSU conservative alliance, signaled he could overturn the ban of his predecessor, Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, on delivering Taurus to Ukraine. The Taurus is a powerful cruise missile capable of striking targets at a distance of 500 kilometers (300 miles), more than the long-range capabilities Ukraine received from other partners. However, the German government has not approved sending Taurus missiles to Ukraine so far. Ukraine has been using U.S.-made ATACMS for over a year, and U.K.-French Storm Shadow/SCALP for more than two, initially being allowed to deploy them only against Russian targets on Ukrainian territory. Only in late 2024, the Biden administration and other allies eased the restrictions, allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian military targets on Russian territory.

She holds a bachelor's degree in political journalism from Taras Shevchenko University and a master's degree in political science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. Restrictions were imposed on 60 legal entities and 73 Russian citizens. The attack, which occurred at around 9 a.m., injured 59 people, sparked fires, and damaged civilian infrastructure. The media outlet also published footage purportedly showing a burning maritime drone that was allegedly shot down during the attack. Fears of escalating Chinese military intervention in Taiwan have risen sharply since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The news comes amid a major deterioration in Russian-Azerbaijani relations after a deadly June 27 operation in Russia's Yekaterinburg, where Russian security forces killed two Azerbaijani nationals. Russian air defenses on July 5 shot down four drones advancing on Moscow, prompting a temporary halt to outgoing flights at Sheremetyevo, one of the capital's main airports. Explosions near Russia's Vladivostok damaged a gas pipeline and destroyed a water pipeline that supplied military facilities in the area, an unnamed intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on July 5. The announcement came a day after Trump signed his sweeping tax cut and spending bill into law, a legislative act that Musk has fiercely opposed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Benedict Kuria and some colleagues were ambushed in March by suspected gang members. Haitian media reported that he had died, but Kenya's police service says a search is continuing. “We've tried many times to get information from the government, but they've refused,” said Kuria's wife, Miriam Watima. In a search for answers, Kuria's family filed a court petition in June that listed the attorney-general, the inspector general of police and various ministers as respondents. “We entrusted our son with the government,” said Kuria's mother, Jacinta Kabiru. Kuria, a 33-year-old administration police officer, joined the MSS last July. On 26 March the MSS said he was “unaccounted for” after an ambush the day before on a team who had gone to assist the recovery of a Haitian police vehicle stuck in a ditch that it suspected had been dug by gangs. Later on 26 March, Kenyan police said a search and rescue mission was continuing, while local leaders and police chiefs went to Watima's house in the town of Kikuyu, north-west of Nairobi in Kiambu county, to tell her that her husband was missing. But the following day, Haitian media outlets reported that Kuria had been killed, quoting Haiti's presidential transitional council as saying that he “fell … while carrying out his mission” and “gave his life for a better future for our country”. In the months since, his family's desperate scramble for clarity has included visits to police – who have told them a search and rescue mission is continuing – and politicians' offices. Through their lawyer, Mbuthi Gathenji, they have petitioned parliament and written letters to Kenya's attorney-general and María Isabel Salvador, the special representative of the UN secretary-general in Haiti. “We are asking the government to come out with finality.” Kenya's leading role in the mission stemmed from a desire by the US and the UN to restructure international intervention in Haiti with a multinational mission headed by an African country, after a series of floundering UN missions during which UN troops caused a cholera outbreak and peacekeepers were accused of sexual assault. Kenya, which has participated in many peacekeeping missions internationally, volunteered to lead the Haiti intervention. For its president, William Ruto, the deployment was a chance to position his country as a reliable international partner and burnish the reputation of its police force, which regularly uses violence against civilians. In April, Salvador said Haiti was approaching a “point of no return”. “This is an opportunity we have got as a family,” his brother, Philip Kuria, recalled him saying. Kuria was due to return this year at the end of his one-year contract. Kuria's uncle, Daniel Ndung'u, said the family was open to any news. Watima recalled her last call with Kuria as they discussed academic plans for their 17-year-old daughter. She tops up credit for her husband's phone so it doesn't get deactivated, hoping that one day he'll call again. “They should tell us whether he's alive or not,” she said.</p>

TEL AVIV, July 6. /TASS/. The Israel Defense Forces said it continues to consistently carry out strikes across entire Gaza.

The Israeli Air Force, acting in coordination with ground forces, attacked about 130 targets there over the past 24 hours, the army press service reported.

Among the targets were various Hamas sites, including command posts, weapons depots and rocket launchers. Strikes also targeted individual armed militants.

Ground units are conducting raids throughout all of the Strip.

"The Israel Defense Forces are acting to eliminate any threat to the peaceful citizens of the State of Israel," the IDF said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Armenia's Foreign Ministry on July 5 denied claims by Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) that Russia was intensifying its military presence at the country's Gyumri base to exert greater influence in the South Caucasus, the media outlet News Armenia reported. HUR claimed on July 5 that Russia was increasing its military presence in Gyumri and recruiting new troops for the base. Armenia has had a historically close relationship with Russia but the relations between Yerevan and Moscow have recently deteriorated. Russia's leverage over both Baku and Yerevan has diminished dramatically since Azerbaijani troops captured Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-controlled region in Azerbaijan, in 2023. Armenia, which has lambasted Moscow for failing to help it during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, is drifting closer to the West. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has suspended the country's membership in a Russian-led military alliance and announced plans to join the European Union. Recently there has also been a crackdown on the pro-Russian opposition in Armenia. Kateryna Hodunova is a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent.

The attack, which occurred at around 9 a.m., injured 59 people, sparked fires, and damaged civilian infrastructure. The media outlet also published footage purportedly showing a burning maritime drone that was allegedly shot down during the attack. Fears of escalating Chinese military intervention in Taiwan have risen sharply since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The news comes amid a major deterioration in Russian-Azerbaijani relations after a deadly June 27 operation in Russia's Yekaterinburg, where Russian security forces killed two Azerbaijani nationals. Russian air defenses on July 5 shot down four drones advancing on Moscow, prompting a temporary halt to outgoing flights at Sheremetyevo, one of the capital's main airports. Explosions near Russia's Vladivostok damaged a gas pipeline and destroyed a water pipeline that supplied military facilities in the area, an unnamed intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on July 5. The announcement came a day after Trump signed his sweeping tax cut and spending bill into law, a legislative act that Musk has fiercely opposed.</p>

Japanese literature specialist Susumu Nakanishi has published a book introducing the appeal of manyo nihonga, paintings inspired by works in Manyoshu, a compilation of classic waka poems of the eighth century. The 95-year-old author of “Nakanishi Susumu to Manyoga o Tanoshimu” (Find enjoyment in manyo nihonga with Susumu Nakanishi), published by Tankosha Publishing, believes that poetry and painting are closely related. He talked about the pleasure of enjoying waka poetry together with paintings in an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun. Manyo nihonga was created for the opening of the Nara Prefecture Complex of Man'yo Culture in Asuka, Nara Prefecture, in 2001. The collection features work by 154 artists, including Matazo Kayama and Shoko Uemura. They depict landscapes and figures described in Japan's oldest anthology of poems. Nakanishi said that adding pictures to poetry is something “essential” for human beings. Poetry and pictures are two sides of the same coin in terms of sensitivity, and, depending on the way we perceive nature, it becomes a picture or a poem,” he said. Various areas in Japan serve as settings, with many being composed by people while traveling for leisure or for work. For example, a poem by Yamabe no Akahito about snow-capped Mt. “Tagonoura yu / uchiidete mireba / mashiro niso / fuji no takane ni / yuki wa furikeru” (When going out along the shore of Tago and looking at the lofty peak of Mt. Fuji, I see white, glittering snow on top) Inspired by this poem, Tamako Kataoka, in “Mt. Fuji Seen from Tagonoura,” boldly depicted the mountain with a halo of light. “Akiyama no / momichi o shigemi / matoinuru / imo o motomen / yamaji shirazumo” (With the lush yellow leaves of autumn mountain, I wander the mountain path seeking my lost wife) “I was stunned by the bold blood-red color,” said Nakanishi. He also pointed to a small white waterfall painted in the background. Since ancient times, white has been considered a sacred color, and that is why he sees the waterfall as a symbol of an “unobtainable, pure white soul” that Hitomaro was seeking. Nakanishi believes that the world of poetry, which conveys something more than facts, is indispensable for modern people. “They may not serve any practical purpose but can comfort people and soothe their hearts. The role of poetry is essential to human beings,” he said. Poems in Manyoshu still stir the imaginations of people and touch their hearts.
