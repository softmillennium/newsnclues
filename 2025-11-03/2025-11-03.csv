Live Updates


            •  Top business people and thought leaders from the worlds of politics, economics and fashion have gathered in London today for CNN International's first Global Perspectives live event, focused on Africa.
    


            • The summit features in depth conversations and live interviews exploring innovation and sustainable growth, led by CNN's journalists. Stay with us for the latest from the discussions throughout the day.
    


            • We've heard from WTO director general Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who called for “careful thinking” on tensions in Nigeria, after US President Donald Trump suggested the US may take military action there to protect the nation's Christians.
    


            • The prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Judith Suminwa Tuluka, has also called on Rwanda to “accept a ceasefire” between the two countries.
    


            Celebrated Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie gives a wonderful reading about the power of literature.
    


                    “All art forms explore the beautiful strangeness of being a human being. But literature does it with the most intimacy, because it takes us inside. We become characters. We become alive in bodies that are not our own,” she said.
                





            “Reading literature – above all else – reminds us over and over again that there are multiple points of view. A reminder that is needed now, in today's world, more than ever. That to be a human being, is to be part of a project of plurality.”
    


            The Emmy-award winning actress Uzo Aduba says she remembers the best advice she ever received when she started her career – and it came from her mother.
    


            “I would say foundationally, a lot of my art comes from my background which is my Nigerian heritage,” the “Orange is The New Black” star told CNN's Zain Asher.
    


            “My mother, when I first moved to New York gave me the best advice of my life … Knowing that what I was about to approach was going to be the hardest thing I ever did in my life, she said, ‘Uzo – just work hard!'”
    


            “The spirit of that tenacity, the spirit of that discipline, the spirit of that vision, and understanding the full connection cellularly that it would require for me to get to where I wanted to is what I bring to my work – and that is uniquely African.”
    


Masai Ujiri, co-founder of Zaria Group and Giants of Africa, believes the untapped human potential across sport, entertainment and the arts is the continent's “biggest resource.”
    


            “We have to teach, we have to educate that sports infrastructure, entertainment infrastructure is infrastructure. We have to see sports as a business,” Ujiri told CNN's Eleni Giokos.
    


            “Africa's biggest resource jewel, the biggest thing we have, is its people. We are so talented, it's crazy,” he added. “Pilots, chefs, artists, basketball players, soccer (players), accountants, everything you can think of — we are truly the most talented continent in the world.
    


            “There's a huge opportunity. But we (don't) have the infrastructure to do this. We need to build. We need to see it. Our youth is fast-growing. We need jobs.”
    


Nonkululeko Nyembezi, the chairperson of Standard Bank Group and co-chair of B20, a forum for the global business community, told CNN's Richard Quest that infrastructure is key to growing intra-Africa trade across the continent.
    


                    “Even on the core infrastructure, what we have in Africa today is infrastructure that's designed from mine to port, because it was designed for export and for extraction industries,” she said.
                





            “What this next phase is now calling us to do, in order to make the African Continental Free Trade Area a live project, is to start building infrastructure that connects Africa to itself. If we are ever going to get intra-Africa trade to happen, the infrastructure planning and the infrastructure development needs to change.”
    


            The spokesperson for Madagascar's Gen Z-led protest movement that helped overthrow the government last month says “the hard work is beginning,” as the military takes control of the island nation.
    


Elliot Randriamandrato admits that protesters did not expect the military to seize control of the country following the wave of demonstrations against the cost of living and public services in Madagascar.
    


            “We have to have a close relationship with the new regime,” he told CNN's Eleni Giokos, during a discussion on Africa's next generation of leaders.
    


                    “The main challenge we have right now is to be heard, to be listened [to], and to take part in the different negotiations,” he added.
                





            The relationship between tourism and conservation has always been difficult in Africa; the tourism industry provides jobs, but some argue that it can have a negative impact on local biodiversity.
    


            But conservationist Dr. Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka says tourists could be a “necessary evil” for environmental protection.
    


            “I saw the positive impact of tourism, which was very important for me as a vet student, as a scientist,” she told CNN's Larry Madowo. “Tourism can really help to sustain conservation.”
    


            In the late 90s, Kalema-Zikusoka set up the first veterinary unit at the Uganda Wildlife Authority, before undertaking a zoological medical residency and masters in specialized veterinary medicine at North Carolina State University and North Carolina Zoological Park.
    


            “Humans have disturbed the wildlife so much,” she said. “I found out that the gorillas' habitat was really encroached.”
    


            Now, conservationists have found a “happy medium” between enabling conservation efforts, engaging with local communities and boosting the overall economy, added Kalema-Zikusoka.
    


            “There are four subspecies of gorillas in the wild,” she explained, “but the only subspecies that is growing steadily in number is the one where there's tourism, which is the mountain gorillas. So, tourism is helping. Maybe it's a necessary evil.”
    


            After speaking with Ozwald Boateng, Eva Omaghomi, founder of consultancy firm Forster Jones & Associates, hosted a panel on how Africa can reclaim global luxury.
    


Thelma West, founder of Thelma West Diamonds, told Omaghomi that: “When people picture African luxury, they usually imagine raw materials — so it's the gold, diamonds, fabric — it's rarely the soul behind it: the imagination, the innovation.
    


            “We need to move from a continent that supplies the world with its finest materials to one that actually creates beauty and puts it out in the world as a finished product.
    


            “We have the materials – we just need to create,” she added. “The future of luxury cannot simply be about extraction — it has to be about creation.”
    


            Fashion designer Ozwald Boateng told Eva Omaghomi, founder of Forster Jones & Associates, that when he started out in the early 1980s in London, race was a barrier to entry, and he had learned through his childhood that he had to fight for his voice to be heard.
    


            “So, when I realized I had a talent for designing clothes, I very quickly went, ‘How do I use my creativity to make a bigger point?'”
    


            When he was 18, he visited Savile Row, a London street known for its bespoke men's tailoring, and saw an opportunity: “The street was a bastion of British tradition, but it was dying. It needed a revitalization to a new audience. I recognized that I could do that.”
    


            In 1995, Boateng opened his first retail store, in Savile Row, achieving two goals: firstly “a cultural point, from my own heritage — and I was saving something that was very important to be British.”
    


            Fast-forward to this year, and Boateng's shimmering designs for the Met Gala in New York — themed “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” — cemented his lasting style legacy.
    


Dr. Anne-Marie Imafidon MBE, CEO and co-founder Stemettes, which promotes the inclusion of women and non-binary people in STEM industries (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), took to the stage alongside CNN's Zain Asher.
    


            “We're in the middle of a fourth industrial revolution,” says Imafidon, with so much exciting “untapped potential.” But more people need to be in the conversation and listened to, she adds.
    


            She gave the example of company launching a health tech wearable that tracked women's periods… on a 10-day cycle, to highlight a lack of inclusivity behind the scenes.
    


            “It's about saying there's a whole population that's not represented in the way we built this technology,” Imafidon said.
    


            Gender inclusivity goes hand in hand with geography too, she said, adding, while referring to the continent: “Can you build something globally if it doesn't work for 54 countries?”
    


            “They're going to be your customers, they should be your innovators.”
    


            A crop of African-founded financial technology (fintech) start-ups has risen over the past decade.
    


            Here, four leading industry figures told CNN's Richard Quest the key to unlocking a sustainable ecosystem for budding entrepreneurs lies in: Addressing funding gaps and skills shortages, improving intra-continental cohesion, and creating a fluid regulatory system to match an ever-evolving market.
    


                    “The only way to grow legitimate payments is to enable the players to actually be able to play – and let the guys who have the infrastructure, the licenses, the know-how, the technology, to actually be in the market. But that said, we're still behind.”Alex Okosi, managing director, Google Africa.






                    “Us and regulators, we have the same vision, the same objective. We want to drive financial inclusion, we want people to get more dignity. What is more important than financial inclusion, is for people to be independent financially.”Serigne Dioum, CEO, MTN Group Fintech






                    “The only way to grow legitimate payments is to enable the players to actually be able to play – and let the guys who have the infrastructure, the licenses, the know-how, the technology, to actually be in the market. But that said, we're still behind.”Olugbenga Agboola, co-founder and CEO, Flutterwave






                    “Our experience is also, in some countries, the regulations were literally being written as we were talking to them because what we're doing is so new, and they needed to take some steps to think about what's actually happening.Lucy Liu, Co-founder and President, Airwallex. 






            Next up, as part of “Africapitalism” and a New Era of Inclusive Finance, we're discussing “inclusive capitalism” – a term Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, conceded is “an oxymoron to most people today.”
    


            De Rothschild, founder and CEO of the Council for Inclusive Capitalism,  referred to warnings that disillusionment with capitalism is high among many demographics, including Gen Z. Reforms are needed, she argued, “because if capitalism doesn't work for everyone, the system of capitalism is going to go away.”
    


                    “The 1% will come down, and will be taken down by the people who will resent the system,” she added.
                





            What does this mean for the continent?
    


            “Africa,” de Rothschild said, “is a place that could test the contest between capitalism and socialism.”
    


            Fellow panelist Tony O. Elumelu, group chair of Heirs Holdings and founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation, said companies need both profit and purpose.
    


            Elumelu coined the term “Africapitalism” to describe a combination of economic and social investment on the continent. His foundation identifies and invests in 3,000-5,000 young African entrepreneurs annually, he said.
    


            “It's not about charity,” Elumelu added. “It's about value creation … and making sure businesses don't do business for profit alone.”
    


            In 2021, Laura Kabasomi Kakoma became the first African woman nominated in any of the Grammy jazz categories. Four years later, the vocalist, composer, writer, and performer – known as Somi – has played a part in the emergence of African music on the global stage.
    


            “It's been so wonderful to see how that music is traveling around the planet,” she told CNN's Larry Madowo. “I think people are starting to look at African artists in a different way. Really be able to see us, really be able to think about: What does it mean to be a part of a contemporary moment in culture?
    


            “I'm grateful for the extended visibility that those artists grant to so many others,” she said.
    


            In recent years, some musicians have pushed for global recognition beyond the confines of the “Afrobeats” genre. In 2024, the Grammys added a new category – Best African Music Performance – to capture the multiplicity of sounds across a continent of 54 nations. However, Somi believes there is more work to be done. “I still think there's an opportunity to push against the monolith of African music,” she said.
    


            Born in Illinois to parents from Rwanda and Uganda, the vocalist is inspired by “being a child of immigrants.”
    


            “That's something that's always raised, this question of home,” said Somi. “We always talk so much about telling our stories. What does it mean to be a witness – not only of the music that's happening in the moment, but how do you witness the ordinary lives of African people in the world? Whether they're on the continent, or in the diaspora.”
    


            The event has paused for lunch here at The Chancery Rosewood hotel. We'll be back with you soon.
    


            During a lively panel here alongside Sanda Ojiambo, CEO and executive director, United Nations Global Compact and hosted by CNNs Jim Scuitto, Mo Ibrahim Foundation founder and chair Dr. Mo Ibrahim describes the new world disorder as a “wake up call.”
    


                    “There's no crisis without a silver lining,” he said. “What's happening around the world is a call to action.”
                





            Ibrahim bemoaned the inertia of the UN Security Council, the disempowerment of the United Nations and other institutions, and poked fun at the US.
    


                    “The fraying of the international order, the collapse of rule of law globally, the rise of strongmen … Your country now,” he told Scuitto, “if you'll allow me, is very familiar to me, because it just looks like an African country. It's very familiar to me, so I'm very comfortable with you guys.”
                





            “Without peace you cannot have development,” Ibrahim added regarding the African continent, saying that conflict has never delivered for its people.
    


            In a region where internet use has skyrocketed over the past decade, Africa's largest internet provider is dedicated to involving Gen Z in digital transformation, according to Ebenezer Asante, the senior vice president of markets for MTN Group.
    


            Asante told CNN's Larry Madowo that cross-generational partnership is essential to growth in Africa. “We are getting to a space where, without a partnership, and working together — not only with our competitors, but also with other investors, with government, as well as multilateral agencies and development fund providers — we are simply not going to be able to cover the next one billion people.”
    


            Although internet adoption in Africa has surged in recent years, just 38% of the population uses the internet, according to the International Telecommunication Union — far below the global average of 68%.
    


            Providers must collaborate with policymakers and regulators to reduce the cost of the internet and the cost of deployment, added Asante, and invest in younger generations. “We require smarter regulations, working with government, working with regulators. We're required to bring the cost of deployment way lower than where it is today,” he said.
    


            “Why can't Africa feed itself when we have all this arable land?” Larry Madowo asks Dr. Florence Wambugu, CEO of Africa Harvest, Dr. Ismahane Elouafi, executive managing director of CGIAR and Sunny Verghese, co-founder and group CEO, Olam Group Limited.
    


                    The “elephant in the room” is Africa's “$40B in imported food crops” every year, said Wambugu, and “leaders who prefer to import rather than invest in their countries.”
                





            Technology adoption and investing in the continent's hundreds of millions of small-scale farmers is the path forward, argued the panel, speaking during Soil to Scale at CNN's Global Perspectives.
    


            Elouafi said per hectare, Africa is producing 20-40% the yield of a highly developed nation.
    


            “The green revolution we've been talking about for so long has skipped Africa,” she said, adding that the solutions are there to bridge the yield gap relatively quickly.
    


            Maximizing agricultural efficiency on the continent could have wide-ranging impact.
    


            To feed the world's growing population between now and 2100, Verghese said “593 million hectares” of new agricultural land needs to be found, “equal to twice the size of India,” she added.
    


            Africa, which contains more than 60 percent of the world's remaining uncultivated land, represents a huge opportunity.
    


Ademola Adesina, the co-founder and president of digital infrastructure provider Sabi, told CNN's Richard Quest that Africa had in some ways “actually benefitted” from the tariffs imposed earlier this year by the Trump administration — because they have led to a more decentralized mineral supply chain.”
    


            “There's a requirement that some of these critical minerals come directly from Africa now and not go through the elephant in the room: China,” said Adesina.
    


            “The fact that we're having to source these critical minerals directly from the African countries will also mean that we need to add value in Africa, and we need to actually process and go up the value chain — in a way that hasn't been the case in the past,” added Adesina.
    


            The CEO of DP World has highlighted how important African routes are to his company, one of the world's largest logistics firms.
    


            “We are everywhere in the world – the biggest growth we see in business is in Africa,” Ahmed Bin Sulayem told CNN's Richard Quest. “One port we have in Senegal does more business than all our ports in Europe combined,” he added. “Africa has the highest growth, the population in 15 years will be two billion – they will surpass China, they will surpass India.”
    


            CNN's Jim Scuitto sat down with Professor Carlos Lopes of The University of Cape Town to discuss how Africa is responding to turbulent global economics and geopolitics.
    


            “Africa's agency has been on the rise,” said Lopes, regarding global relations.
    


            In the quest for influence, “Western countries are losing the game,” he argued, signposting Africa's increased ties with the Gulf states, Turkey and India – “as important as China was a decade ago.”
    


            For the first time ever, Africa will have the highest economic growth rate of any continent in the world, he said, with 40 African nations above the global average.
    


            Lopes said outside the continent, perceptions need to be recalibrated: “Africa is a net exporter of capital. This idea that we're being helped needs to be turned on its head.”
    


            CNN anchor and Chief National Security Analyst Jim Sciutto talks to Bissau-Guinean development economist Professor Carlos Lopes about how Africa can secure a lasting position of power amid a rapidly shifting global order.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Japan's new leader Takaichi says she wants to meet North Korea's Kim Jong Un","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/03/asia/japan-takaichi-north-korea-kim-jong-un-intl-hnk","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 08:08:50 GMT","


Japan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said she wants to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un – something no Japanese leader has done in more than 20 years.
    


            “We have already conveyed to North Korea our desire to hold a summit meeting,” Takaichi said Monday at a rally demanding the return of Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea decades ago.
    


            The issue is one of the unresolved pain points between the two neighbors divided by sea, whose long history of colonization and conflict has doomed previous attempts at bilateral talks.
    


            “I want the leaders to face each other directly and achieve concrete results,” Takaichi said. “I am determined to break through and resolve the abduction issue during my tenure.”
    


            Japan says at least 17 of its citizens were snatched by North Korean agents in the late 1970s and 1980s. Five citizens were returned in 2002. The abductions appear to have been part of North Korea's espionage program, according to a 2014 UN report.



With a new leader – and Trump in town – Japanese families whose loved ones were abducted by North Korea have fresh hope



            Pyongyang disputes the total number taken and says some died in traffic and drowning accidents, as well as suicide, and it considers the matter over.
    


            But for the families of Japanese abductees who remain missing, some of whom were just teenagers when they were taken, there has been no closure or relief. They, along with Japan's revolving door of leaders over the years, have continued pressing the issue with little success.
    


            Takaichi has met with the abductees' families twice since taking office, including once with US President Donald Trump during his visit to Japan. She has previously said she's committed to completing the mission of her mentor, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who introduced the abductees' families to Trump during the US president's first term.
    


            The two countries held an unprecedented summit in 2002, with Japan's then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visiting the North Korean capital Pyongyang to meet Kim Jong Il – the father of now-leader Kim Jong Un.
    


            That visit was the first time a Japanese prime minister visited North Korea since the end of WWII.
    


            It was also the first time North Korea acknowledged its role in the abductions, after many years of denial. Kim Jong Il offered an apology at the time, saying the agents responsible had been punished, and promised to prevent it happening again, according to Japanese government statements at the time.
    


            The five detainees were returned to Japan the following month and reunited with their families – 20 to 30 years after their abduction.
    


            Koizumi returned to North Korea to meet Kim Jong Il a second time in 2004, during which the family members of several abductees were also allowed to return to Japan.
    


            No further repatriations have happened since then – and no progress has been made in talks between the two countries, despite repeated efforts by successive governments.
    


            Abe, who was assassinated in 2022, had signaled a willingness to meet Kim Jong Un without conditions to improve ties between their countries; several years later, then-leader Fumio Kishida also conveyed his intention to meet the North Korean leader.
    


            Each time, a meeting failed to materialize. Now Takaichi, who took office after winning an election in October, is inheriting a decades-old problem that stumped her predecessors – and hoping to be the one to solve it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","‘We were waiting for this moment'","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/sport/india-cricket-womenn-world-cup-intl-hnk","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:51:00 GMT","


            India won the Women's Cricket World Cup for the first time with a 52-run victory over South Africa on Sunday, led by brilliant all-round performances from Deepti Sharma and Shafali Verma.
    


            Opening batter Verma, who was only called back into the squad as injury cover for the finals, scored a career-best 87 off 78 balls as the tournament co-host reached 298-7 in 50 overs after losing the toss and being sent in to bat.
    


            South Africa was out for 246 in 45.3 overs in reply with its chase effectively over after skipper Laura Wolvaardt was out for 101. Spinner Sharma took the final wicket of the match and returned bowling figures of 5-39 from 9.3 overs.
    


            “We were waiting for this moment, and now this moment has come,” India captain Harmanpreet Kaur said, reflecting on a triumph after two previous finals defeats. “Now we want to make this a habit.”
    


            India was the last of the four teams to qualify for the semifinals, but then beat defending champion and seven-time winner Australia by five wickets to reach the final. South Africa beat four-time champion England by 125 runs to reach the final for the first time.
    


            Winning at home gave India its first major women's cricket title. Harmanpreet Kaur's squad was the first, first-time champion since 2000, when New Zealand ended the long dominance of Australia and England.
    


            Verma - who was drafted in last week for the injured Pratika Rawal - took 2-36 with the ball and was voted player of the match.
    


            “God sent me to do something good, and that was reflected today,” the 21-year-old Verma said. “I only focused on making runs today. My mind was clear.”
    


            Before her five-wicket haul, Sharma (58) posted her third half-century of the tournament to help India reached the second highest total in a World Cup final after Australia's 356-5 against England in 2022.
    


            She finished the tournament with 22 wickets and 215 runs in nine matches to capture the player of the tournament honors.
    


            “I enjoyed myself with both bat and ball,” Sharma said of the final. “We were not relaxed at any time, but we were calm. I dedicate this trophy to my parents.”
    


            Wolvaardt a fine century on the back of her impressive semifinal performance. She was easily the tournament's highest scorer with 571 runs at an average 71.37.
    


            Chasing a record 299, South Africa made a sedate start under immense pressure from medium pacer Renuka Singh.
    


            Wolvaardt shared a 51-run first-wicket stand before a direct throw from Amanjot Kaur ran out and Tazmin Brits for 23 in the 10th over.
    


            Anneke Bosche was bowled for a duck before Wolvaardt reached her half-century off 45 balls. She added 52 off 51 balls with Sune Luus, who scored 25.
    


            India lost its review in desperation to get Wolvaardt dismissed, and then gambled with Verma's gentle off-breakers.
    


            The ploy worked with another double blow - Verma picked up two wickets in six deliveries to have South Africa in trouble at 123-4 in 22.1 overs. She sent back Luus with an easy return catch, and then had Marizanne Kapp (4) caught behind.
    


            Wolvaardt tried to keep the chase alive through partnerships with Sinalo Jafta (16) and Annerie Dercksen, who scored 35. In doing so, she reached a century off 96 balls.
    


            Sharma bowled Dercksen and then blunted South Africa's chances when she Wolvaardt caught by Kaur in the 42nd over with the total at 220-7.
    


            Verma played a key role in setting the Proteas a challenging target after the final was delayed by two hours because of rain.
    


            She hit seven fours and two sixes and shared a 104-run opening stand with Smriti Mandhana (45).
    


            After Chloe Tryon dismissed Mandhana in the 18th over, Verma combined with Jemimah Rodrigues (24) to add a further 62 before both were out.
    


            From 171-3 in 29.4 overs, skipper Harmanpreet tried to restore the momentum but was bowled by Nonkululeko Mlaba in the 39th over. She scored only 20 runs, but combined with Sharma for 52 runs off 56 balls.
    


            Sharma steadied the innings with a run-a-ball 58, including three fours and a six and shared a pivotal 47-run, sixth-wicket partnership with Richa Ghosh that helped set up the winning total.
    


            The Board of Control for Cricket in India punctuated the tournament with a social media post to reflect the historic victory, topping the congratulatory message with the letters: C.H.A.M.P.I.O.N.S.

The leak of a video allegedly showing Israeli soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian prisoner is the “most serious public relations attack against Israel,” Benjamin Netanyahu has said.

The footage, filmed at the Sde Teiman base near the Gaza border, showed soldiers leading a blindfolded detainee away and surrounding him with riot shields as they allegedly carried out the abuse. Leaked to Israel's Channel 12, it aired in August 2024 and caused an uproar.

The detainee was later treated for a ruptured bowel, severe anal and lung injuries, and broken ribs. Five reservists were initially probed for rape, but their charges were later downgraded to “severe abuse,” according to a February indictment. All denied the charges, and the trial is ongoing.

The scandal reignited on Friday after the Israel Defense Force's (IDF) top military lawyer, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, admitted that she had approved the video's release and resigned from her post.

At a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu decried the scandal, saying the leak “caused enormous reputational damage to Israel, to the IDF, and to our soldiers.”

“It is perhaps the most serious public relations attack Israel has experienced since its founding – I cannot recall one so concentrated and intense,” Netanyahu said, as cited by The Times of Israel, and called for “an independent and impartial inquiry.”

The leak followed the arrest of the reservists accused of abuse, which sparked right-wing riots demanding their release. In her resignation letter, Tomer-Yerushalmi said she leaked the video amid pressure to halt the investigation into the incident, insisting her duty was to act on “reasonable suspicion of violence against a detainee.”

Multiple right-wing politicians, including Defense Minister Israel Katz, have since claimed the release of the footage from security cameras amounted to a “blood libel” against falsely accused soldiers, despite their indictments. Last week, a criminal investigation was launched into the leak.

The case drew sharp criticism from a UN commission investigating Israel's treatment of Palestinians, which said it “represented the tip of the iceberg.” It noted that detainees at Sde Teiman and other Israeli detention sites were routinely shackled, beaten, and subjected to acts of sexual nature. These and other findings earlier this year prompted the UN to accuse Israel of genocide against Palestinians.

Kiev has received additional US-made Patriot air defense systems from Germany, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky has said.

Ukraine has been pressing its Western backers for more long-range weapons, including Tomahawk cruise missiles and additional Patriot batteries. The New York Times reported in May that although the country possessed eight Patriot systems, only six were operational.

In a post on X on Sunday, Zelensky thanked German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. “Our agreements have been fulfilled. More Patriots are now in Ukraine and being put into operation,” he wrote.

“Of course, more systems are needed to protect key infrastructure sites and our cities across the entire territory of Ukraine, and we will continue working to obtain them – not only at the political level with states and leaders but also directly with manufacturers of all necessary air defense systems and missiles for them,” he added.

The Russian Defense Ministry claims it has destroyed around 40 Patriot launchers since 2023.

While US President Donald Trump has declined to supply Ukraine with Tomahawks, he has allowed NATO countries to purchase American weapons on Kiev's behalf. Moscow has maintained that no amount of foreign aid will change the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine's favor.

Last month, Zelensky said Ukraine and the US were preparing a contract for 25 Patriot systems. He added that deliveries could take years unless EU states demonstrate “goodwill” by prioritizing Kiev or transferring systems they already possess.

With each system costing about $1 billion, Ukraine hopes to finance the purchases through an EU loan backed by frozen Russian assets. Russia has condemned any attempt to confiscate its assets as theft.

WASHINGTON, November 3. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump accused Russia, North Korea, China, Pakistan and other countries of secretly holding underground nuclear tests.

""But they don't go and tell you about it. And, you know, as powerful as they are, this is a big world. You don't necessarily know where they're testing. They— they test way under— underground where people don't know exactly what's happening with the test. You feel a little bit of a vibration,"" Trump said in an interview with CBS News.

""They test and we don't test. We have to test. And Russia did make— a little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China— and China does test, and we're gonna test also,"" the US leader added as he stated that North Korea and Pakistan, too, have been testing.

""We have the best [nuclear weapons], and I was the one that renovated them and built them during a four-year period [as a president]. And I hated to do it, because the destructive capability is something you don't even wanna talk about,"" the US leader explained.

""And if we have 'em [nuclear arsenals], we have to test 'em, otherwise you don't really know how they're gonna work. And we don't wanna ever use them,"" Trump concluded.

On October 29, Trump instructed the Pentagon to immediately resume nuclear weapons testing. He did not specify what type of tests he meant or whether they would involve detonating nuclear warheads.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Trump said Paramount's sale to David and Larry Ellison was ‘greatest thing that's happened in a long time' for free press

The CBS News program 60 Minutes heavily edited down an interview with Donald Trump that aired on Sunday night, his first sit-down with the show in five years.

Trump sat down with correspondent Norah O'Donnell for 90 minutes, but only about 28 minutes were broadcast. A full transcript of the interview was later published, along with a 73-minute-long extended version online.

The edits are notable because, exactly one year before Trump was interviewed by O'Donnell at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Friday he had sued CBS over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, which he alleged had been deceptively edited to help her chances in the presidential election.

While many legal experts widely dismissed the lawsuit as “meritless” and unlikely to hold up under the first amendment, CBS settled with Trump for $16m in July. As part of the settlement, the network had agreed that it would release transcripts of future interviews of presidential candidates.

At the beginning of Sunday's show, O'Donnell reminded viewers that Paramount settled Trump's lawsuit, but noted that “the settlement did not include an apology or admission of wrongdoing”.

During the interview, in a clip that did not air on the broadcast, Trump needled CBS over the settlement and repeated his claims against the network.

“Actually 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money. And you don't have to put this on, because I don't wanna embarrass you, and I'm sure you're not,” Trump said. “But 60 Minutes was forced to pay me a lot of money because they took her answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can't have fake news. You've gotta have legit news. And I think that it's happening.”

During another un-aired portion of the interview, Trump praised the sale of CBS to the Ellison family and said the network's new editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, was a “great new leader”.

The US president said he didn't know Weiss, but told O'Donnell: “I hear she's a great person.

“I think you have a great new leader, frankly, who's the young woman that's leading your whole enterprise, is a great – from what I know,” he said.

Trump was particularly effusive in praising David Ellison and his father, Larry, the new owner of CBS News' parent company, Paramount, through their company Skydance Media.

“I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership,” Trump said. “I think it's the greatest thing that's happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.”

O'Donnell did not directly respond to the president's comments about Weiss and the Ellisons.

Among Trump's many answers that were edited out were several comments questioning the integrity of the 2020 presidential election, which he said “was rigged and stolen”.

At one point in the interview, in a segment that was not aired on the broadcast, Trump tried to get O'Donnell to acknowledge that crime was down in Washington DC, where she lives.

“You live here. You know that too,” Trump said, asking O'Donnell: “Do you see a difference?”

“I think I've been working too hard,” O'Donnell responded. “I haven't been out and about that much … I get in my car and go to work and I go home.”

Trump said “that's not a fair answer” and insisted that O'Donnell noticed a difference.

The president then seemed to suggest that the back-and-forth didn't need to be aired on the show.

“You don't have to use that one,” he said. “Don't worry, don't worry, I don't want to embarrass her.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Trump administration says in court filing it plans to use emergency funds to partially cover November Snap benefits for millions of Americans

The Trump administration has said in a court filing that it plans to partially fund food aid for millions of Americans after two judges ruled last week that it must use contingency funds to pay for the benefits in November during the government shutdown.

This is per a snap updated from the Reuters news agency and I'll bring you more on this as we get it.

Per my last post, the administration laid out the US Department of Agriculture's plan in a filing in federal court in Rhode Island at the direction of a judge who had last week ordered it to use emergency funds to at least partially cover November's Snap benefits.

The justice department said the USDA is complying with US district judge John McConnell's order and “will fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of Snap contingency funds today”.

But while the administration said it would fully deplete the $5.25bn in contingency funds, it would not use other funding that would allow it to fully fund Snap benefits for 42 million Americans, which cost $8bn to $9bn per month.

Per that last post, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer quipped on social media today.

“Maybe I should file a complaint with the FCC against the Trump White House for editing his unhinged 60 Minutes interview,” the top Democrat wrote on X. “It will use the exact same language Trump lodged against Vice President Harris.”

Ahead of election day across the country, my colleague Carter Sherman, has been covering how reproductive rights will be back on the ballot in this off-cycle year. 

Carter notes the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia could have sweeping consequences for abortion access in two states that have become havens for women fleeing abortion bans. In Pennsylvania, what should have been a relatively sleepy judicial-retention election has evolved into the most expensive race of its kind in nearly 50 years, largely due to heated fighting over abortion. With voters weighing whether to keep three Democratic justices on the state supreme court, advocates fear that liberals may lose control of the bench and, ultimately, lose abortion access in the purple state.

When asked by reporters about the president's insistence for lawmakers to abolish the filibuster, Mike Johnson said that he had spoken to Donald Trump over the weekend and shared his thoughts with him.

“I hear my Senate Republican colleagues, some of the most conservative people in Congress, who say it's an important safeguard. It prevents us, it holds us back from the Democrats' worst impulses,” Johnson said. “What would the Democrats do if they had no filibuster impediment, no speed bump at all?”

The House speaker added that he speaks “frankly and honestly” with the president and noted that he was very “passionate” about this issue. “I think what you see in this, this, this debate we're having on our own side is a reflection of the anger that we feel, the real desperation that we feel, because we want the government to be reopened,” Johnson said.

Mike Johnson has said that issuing payments to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) beneficiaries in the midst of the shutdown is “not as easy as hitting go send on a computer”.

In recent days, two federal judges ordered the administration to use the program's contingency funds to pay to Snap recipients. Today, Johnson said this was more complicated than it looked.

“It costs over $9bn to fund Snap for a month, and we only have, I think it's $5.2bn in the contingency fund. So you have a big shortfall,” he said. “You got to go through and recalculate partial payments to the 42 million recipients of the program.”

Johnson noted that the president was not appealing against the rulings from the respective judges. “He wants that to be done,” Johnson said. “But he doesn't see the mechanism to do it. So you have treasury, you have USDA, you have the other agencies involved that are working overtime, literally around the clock over the weekend, trying to figure out how to do this. But everybody needs to know, it's not the full amount, assuming they could get this done and processed.”

Throughout today's press conference, Mike Johnson has continued to blame Senate Democrats for shuttering the government for 34 days. He, and many congressional Republicans, have claimed that the reason that lawmakers on the left have consistently rejected the House-passed funding bill is due to pressure from the progressive wing of the Democratic party.

“They fear that personally for their own political future,” Johnson said today. “And they care more about that than they care about Snap benefits flow into hungry families, about air traffic controllers being paid so they can keep the skies safe, border patrol, troops and all the rest … It is extremism on the left that is the direct cause of American suffering right now.”

In a short while, Republican House speaker Mike Johnson will hold a press conference, on the 34th day of the government shutdown.

We'll bring you the latest lines, particularly when it comes to reopening the lower chamber, as the shutdown is poised to be the longest on record (likely to beat the 35 days during Donald Trump's first administration).

In an interview with CBS News' 60 Minutes, Trump said that he's “not a fan of Cuomo one way or the other”, but he would rather see the former governor win against the progressive frontrunner and state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani to be the next mayor of New York City.

“If it's gonna be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I'm gonna pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you,” Trump said.

Actor who said in 2015 that a Trump presidency would be ‘the end of the world' says celebrities make no difference to how people vote

Jennifer Lawrence has said she no longer feels it appropriate to speak out against the Trump administration, lest she exacerbate unhelpful debate and further divisions.

“I don't really know if I should,” said Lawrence in an interview with the New York Times. “During the first Trump administration, I felt like I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off. But as we've learned, election after election, celebrities do not make a difference whatsoever on who people vote for.

“So then what am I doing? I'm just sharing my opinion on something that's going to add fuel to a fire that's ripping the country apart.”

Lawrence has previously been open about voting for both right and leftwing candidates for the presidency. Raised by conservative Republicans in Kentucky, she voted for John McCain in 2008 before joining the Democratic party and saying she realised during Obama's administration that voting Republican was voting against her own rights as a woman.

In 2015, she said Donald Trump's election to the White House would be “the end of the world” and endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 election. In 2024, she lent her support to Kamala Harris, “because I think she's an amazing candidate and I know that she will do whatever she can to protect reproductive rights”.

Lawrence was joined by most of Hollywood in her rejection of Donald Trump as a candidate for re-election, but the lack of leverage stars have over the voting intentions of the public was highlighted by Trump's victory.

“The second term feels different,” said Lawrence of Trump's presidency. “Because he said what he was going to do. We knew what he did for four years. He was very clear. And that's what we chose.”

Lawrence is promoting Die, My Love, Lynne Ramsay's drama in which she plays a new mother who struggles with her mental health in rural Montana. Speaking at a press conference for the film in Venice, Lawrence said of Israel's bombings in Gaza: “I'm terrified. It's mortifying. What's happening is no less than a genocide and it's terrible.”

She continued by saying that she was saddened by “the disrespect in the discourse of American politics right now and how that is going to be normalised to the kids right now. It's going to be normal to them that politicians lie.”

Lawrence sought to redirect anger about the conflict to decision-makers rather than actors and artists. “Stay focused on who is responsible,” she said, in what many took to be a reference to the then-recent pledge signed by more than 4,000 entertainment industry figures to boycott Israeli film institutions.

The actor, who won an Oscar aged 22 for her role in Silver Linings Playbook, is attracting awards attention for her performance in Die, My Love. Although Ramsay has rejected the story being interpreted as one of postpartum depression and psychosis, Lawrence said that she did relate to elements of her character's journey after the birth of her second son, soon after shooting ended.

“It was fear about my child,” she said, “just picturing every worst-case scenario, and then doubting everything that I was doing. I was already in therapy, but I got on a drug called Zurzuvae and I took it for two weeks and it really helped.”

The actor also spoke to the New York Times of the liberating necessity of completing nude scenes in the film while she was some months pregnant and unable to exercise.

“It feels nice,” she said, of being forced to cast off vanity. “I mean, I do have moments where I'm like, What technically are the differences between me and a prostitute? But it doesn't keep me up at night.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

That is a “roundabout,” a well-known alternative to traditional intersections. Drivers enter and exit at different points without relying on traffic lights. Their primary purpose is to improve traffic flow and minimize the likelihood of high-speed collisions, particularly dangerous T-bone and head-on crashes.
  Roundabouts have existed and been implemented for over a century. In the 1960s, the modern roundabout emerged in the UK, with added rules for yielding. Unlike intersections with red lights, roundabouts allow vehicles to continue moving at a

Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil refineries and Western sanctions have significantly benefited top Western oil companies, Reuters reported on Nov. 3. 

The coordinated impact of Ukrainian drone attacks and Western restrictions has reduced Russian oil output and exports, driving up refining margins and profits for U.S. and European competitors.

Profits from refining operations among the four largest Western oil companies rose by 61% in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter, contributing to a 20% overall increase in earnings. 

Since July, Ukraine's drone strikes on Russian refineries and export terminals have cut Russia's average daily oil product exports by 500,000 barrels, according to energy analytics firm Kpler.

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) chief Vasyl Maliuk said on Oct. 31 that Ukrainian forces had conducted nearly 160 successful strikes on Russian oil extraction and refining facilities in 2025.

As a result, Russia shipped only 2 million barrels per day by tanker in September — the lowest level since both the start of the full-scale invasion and the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. 

This lifted global refining margins for Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, and TotalEnergies, which together produce more than 10% of the world's refined oil products, or about 11 million barrels per day. 

Exxon Mobil reported a 30% quarterly profit increase in its energy products division, reaching $1.84 billion, attributing the gains to ""supply disruptions"" in the global market.

British oil and gas company BP, which will publish its quarterly results on Nov. 4, saw its profit margin rise by 33% in the same period. BP previously held nearly 20% of Russian energy giant Rosneft's shares.

The U.S. imposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil on Oct. 22, freezing their U.S.-based assets and threatening secondary sanctions against foreign entities transacting with them.

The European Union's July sanctions, which ban the supply of petroleum products made from Russian crude to Europe starting in January, have also strained Rosneft's operations, including at its Indian refinery that exported significant volumes to European markets. 

The development also follows Kyiv's intensified campaign against Russia's energy infrastructure. Ukrainian drones have struck at least 16 of Russia's 38 oil refineries since August 2025.

Finnish President Alexander Stubb on Nov. 3 suggested a possible meeting between the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S. at the G20 summit in South Africa in late November.

The Kremlin previously said that Putin is not expected to attend the event, which is scheduled to take place in Johannesburg between Nov. 22 and 23. Trump also said he would skip the meeting, with Vice President JD Vance to represent the U.S. instead.

The Kyiv Independent has reached out to the Ukrainian Presidential Office for comment.

According to Stubb, work on ending the war in Ukraine continues behind the scenes. The Finnish president said that he discussed the situation last week with the leaders of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, who will meet with Trump on Nov. 6 and travel to Moscow the following week.

""Central Asian countries could potentially act as messengers between the White House and the Kremlin,"" Stubb said at a press conference in Helsinki, according to MTV Uutiset news channel.

The Finnish president added that ""if things go as expected over the next two to three weeks, then perhaps the place where presidents Putin and Zelensky could meet would be the G20 summit in Johannesburg.""

Trump has sought to organize an in-person meeting between Putin and Zelensky as part of efforts to end the war in Ukraine.

The Kremlin has long avoided such a meeting, repeatedly saying that certain ""conditions"" must be met beforehand and only suggesting talks with Zelensky in Moscow. 

The Ukrainian president has ruled out meeting Putin in Russia as long as Moscow's aggression continues, but repeatedly voiced readiness to meet the Russian leader on neutral ground.

Trump's months-long push to end the war in Ukraine, marked by frequent and radical shifts in Washington's policy, has shown little progress as Moscow continues to reject a ceasefire and pushes territorial demands.

A planned summit between Putin and Trump in Budapest has been scrapped, reportedly after the U.S. administration realized the Kremlin refuses to compromise on its maximalist demands.

Since Trump returned to office in January, he has met Putin only once, during a high-level summit in Alaska on Aug. 15.

Stubb says he sees no grounds for another meeting between Putin and Trump before the G20 summit.

Hello, this is Jared Goyette from a sunny, brisk fall day in Kyiv on day 1,349 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

We are closely monitoring the situation in Pokrovsk, with reports of further deterioration in the city for Ukraine's embattled forces. The latest news is positive — a report from the Ukrainian military that the Russian advance north of the city has been halted — but the situation inside the city and to the south remains unclear. 

Ukrainian forces said on Nov. 3 that they stopped a Russian attempt to advance north of Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in Donetsk Oblast, which is semi-circled by Russian forces and the site of fierce fighting.

The 7th Rapid Response Corps of Ukraine's Air Assault Forces said in a statement that assault and special operations units blocked an effort to cut a supply route between Pokrovsk and nearby Rodynske, killing 19 Russian soldiers. The corps added that the situation in adjacent Myrnohrad — critical to the defense of Pokrovsk's northern flank — was “tense but not critical,” and that additional Ukrainian units had reinforced the area.

At the same time, open-source outlets, such as DeepState Map, and recent media reports indicate the fight for Pokrovsk is intensifying both inside the city and on its southern flank. “On Pokrovsk's eastern and southern perimeters, Russian forces have slowly crept forward in recent weeks, seizing roads, slowly strangling supply lines, and pressuring Ukrainian defenses,” reads a Nov. 3 report from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.



Strike drones from Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) destroyed Russian air defense equipment in Crimea overnight on Nov. 1, including a radar system of an S-400 air defense system, according to HUR.

HUR said in a Nov. 3 Telegram post that the drone attack destroyed a 92N6E multifunctional radar and the power supply equipment of the S-400 command center. The S-400 system, as a whole, costs approximately $500 million for the domestic market (more for export), and the 92N6E radar is one of its most complex and costly components.

The S-400 wasn't the only target in the Nov. 1 attack: other drone strikes destroyed an airfield surveillance radar “AORL-1AS” and the P-18 “Terek” radar, the post said.

Ukraine has systematically targeted Russian air defense in Crimea since mid-2023. The last strike occurred on Oct. 29, when drones from the Special Operations Center “A” of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) destroyed a Pantsir-S2 self-propelled anti-aircraft system, valued at an estimated $20 million, along with two radar stations, in an attack that also targeted two oil depots, according to the SBU.

The UK has transferred additional Storm Shadow cruise missiles to Ukraine, boosting Ukraine's long-range strike capability against targets deep inside Russia, Bloomberg reported Nov. 3, citing unnamed sources.



U.S. President Donald Trump said on Nov. 2 that as of now, he is not planning to provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles.

When asked by reporters if his administration is considering sending Kyiv Tomahawks, Trump responded: ""No, not really… things can change but at this moment I'm not.""

At least six people have been killed and 30 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Nov. 3.

Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 115 out of the 138 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys launched by Russia overnight, as well as one out of the three Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, according to the Air Force. As of the morning of Nov. 3, 20 drone and missile hits were recorded at 11 locations.

In Donetsk Oblast, two people were killed in the town of Myrnohrad, while another one was killed in the Druzhkivka community. In the village of Raihorodok, a Russian strike injured one person, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin.

In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks targeted 36 settlements, killing one person and injuring eight others over the past day, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a 55-year-old man was killed, and four people, including an 8-year-old girl, suffered injuries in an attack against the city of Pavlohrad on Nov. 2, Governor Vladyslav Haivanenko reported.

A 75-year-old man was injured in an FPV (first-person-view) drone strike against the Nikopol district on the same day. He was hospitalized.

Russian forces also attacked the regional center of Dnipro on Nov. 3, injuring a 37-year-old man, according to Haivanenko.

In Sumy Oblast, Russian forces carried out 87 attacks on the region, targeting 35 settlements, over the past day, the local military administration reported.

Russian strikes killed a 52-year-old man and injured five people, including two boys, aged 2 and 5, in the Trostianets community. In the Lebedyn community, two women suffered injuries.

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russia launched 769 strikes on 15 settlements in the region over the past day, injuring three people in the regional center of Zaporizhzhia, the local military administration reported.

In Kharkiv Oblast, Russia targeted 13 settlements, injuring five people, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported.

Russia has lost around 1,144,830 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Nov. 3.

The number includes 1,160 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,321 tanks (+5), 23,531 (+6) armored fighting vehicles, 66,411 (+121) vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,207 (+45)  artillery systems, 1,534 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,235 air defense systems, 428 airplanes, 346 helicopters, 77,435 (+383) drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

Edward S. Rogers III, chairman of the board of directors of Rogers Communications, holds the American League Championship Series trophy after the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Seattle Mariners in Game 7 of the series on Oct. 20.Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press

In business, unlike baseball, Rogers Communications Inc. RCI-B-T is coming out a winner without holding a championship parade.

The Toronto Blue Jays' gutting World Series Game 7 loss is vindication of the decision by executive chair Edward Rogers and chief executive officer Tony Staffieri to make sports a tentpole strategy at the telecom company. Owning the team more than 19 million Canadians watched chase the championship is flipping the switch on perceptions of a company consumers loved to hate, while bulking up its balance sheet.

For even the most casual of fans, the Blue Jays' heady run through baseball's playoffs built a bond with both players such as Ernie Clement – the guy who sat beside you in Grade 10 chemistry – and a company that never stopped reminding viewers it is the “proud owner of Canada's team.” 

Going into this season, Rogers marketing research showed only 30 per cent of Canadians knew the company owned the Blue Jays. For a cellphone and cable operator plagued by perceptions it overcharges, an overachieving team became a heaven-sent branding opportunity.

In an early-season break with precedent, Mr. Rogers and Mr. Staffieri got personally involved in negotiations that signed slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to a US$500-million contract extension. 

Rogers gets brand boost from Blue Jays' World Series run

In an even larger departure from his previously low-profile role with the club, Mr. Rogers joined the new face of the franchise onstage at a press conference to celebrate Mr. Guerrero's arrival in the upper echelon of sports celebrities.

Mr. Rogers will never seek the spotlight. He is uncomfortable speaking to crowds. However, he is stepping up public appearances to burnish the company's brand.

Last month, after Mr. Rogers hoisted the American League championship trophy, he delivered a note-perfect line on what the trip to the World Series meant to the team.

“It's an inspiration to 41 million Canadians from coast to coast to coast,” he said. “This team has the depth and the character, the vision and the courage, and they are going to go all the way.” 

In this season's playoffs, Canada's team faced two showcase franchises, the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees. Both are known for their winning cultures. The Blue Jays pounded the Yankees and came within two home runs off hanging sliders of dispatching a supposedly unbeatable LA team. 

What is the Toronto Blue Jays' playoff run worth to Rogers?

The same fans and pundits who called for the head of Blue Jays team president Mark Shapiro after a last-place finish in the 2024 season are now praising Rogers for sticking with the plan.

Wrapping Rogers in the warm and fuzzy feelings generated by the Blue Jays is a huge win. It speaks to competence at a family-controlled company that hasn't always been able to get out of its own way. 

With the Blue Jays attracting record television audiences and packing their 39,000-seat stadium every night, even to watch games when the team was on the road, it is easy to forget the criticism heaped on company founder Ted Rogers back in 2000, when he bought the team for $165-million.

Then as now, Rogers carried significant debt. Investors and lenders challenged Ted Rogers over the logic of sinking money into baseball as content for a fledgling sports TV channel.

Fast forward 25 years, and soaring broadcast fees for must-see TV events such as the World Series have turned team owners from billionaires into multibillionaires. The Blue Jays are worth an estimated US$2.2-billion. 

Rogers signals it may wait to acquire final MLSE stake before seeking outside investors

As Rogers prepares to take full control of Toronto's other marquee pro-sports franchises later this year by purchasing billionaire Larry Tanenbaum's 25-per-cent stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd., the company is riding a marketing and financial hot streak.

If the past and future faces of Toronto sports ownership get it right, the transition from Mr. Tanenbaum to Edward Rogers as MLSE's leader will have all the drama of ordering a pizza. 

Rogers's entire sports and media division – which includes stakes in hockey's Maple Leafs and basketball‘s Raptors – is valued at $20-billion. The power of these brands is priceless. 

The Blue Jays‘ run and massive valuation on Rogers's sports platform speak to a consistent approach to building a business, after leaders swung and missed on a few pitches.

Ted Rogers always believed in big bets, financed with debt. After his death in 2008, the approach grew tentative. In 2012, CEO Nadir Mohamed teamed up with BCE Inc. BCE-T to acquire 75 per cent of MLSE. Ted Rogers would have called partnering with Bell Canada's parent sleeping with the enemy. Buying out BCE earlier this year meant Rogers returned to a mindset of competing, not co-operating, with telecom rivals.

Opinion: Rogers needs a private equity partner for sports, not an IPO spinout

After Mr. Mohamed retired, Rogers looked to brash British telecom veteran Guy Laurence for leadership. The lasting image of his tenure is Mr. Laurence donning a black leather jacket for a 2014 press conference to unveil a $100-million investment in Vice Media. Two years later, Mr. Laurence was gone. Shortly after, Rogers wrote off the Vice partnership. 

The less said the better on the Rogers family feud that kicked off in 2021 when Edward Rogers decided to cut ties with CEO Joe Natale, recruited at considerable cost in 2017, and replace him with Mr. Staffieri, the former chief financial officer. 

Over the past three years, Mr. Staffieri paid down debt by raising capital from sophisticated investors such as Blackstone Inc. and pension plans. Rogers picked up the pace on signing up new cellphone customers.

The Blue Jays' season-for-the-ages is icing on the cake. The team has a relatively minor impact on the telecom's revenues, given its massive valuation. Last month, Rogers boosted forecast annual revenue from its media and sports platform by $100-million to $4-billion to reflect the deep playoff run. 

The psychological and marketing benefits from owning the Blue Jays are far larger. In interviews after Game 7, Blue Jays manager John Schneider said: “We have set a new expectation and a new standard here, and did it with a lot of hard work, did it with a lot of cohesiveness.” 

Mr. Rogers is hoping the same is true of his company, and its evolving relationship with customers.

First Person is a daily personal piece submitted by readers. Have a story to tell? See our guidelines at tgam.ca/essayguide.

I never imagined that at 50, I would be a caregiver to my husband, just 59, while raising our two children, 13 and 11. Two years ago, Andrew was diagnosed with young-onset Alzheimer's disease, a rare variant form called posterior cortical atrophy, or PCA. Before this, I had never even heard of PCA. Now it defines our lives. Few people understand the grief, loneliness and bursts of humour that come with it.

The road to my husband's diagnosis was long. His first symptoms were with vision. Optometrists said his eyesight was fine. Having worked in healthcare, he thought it might be stress. Then came an epilepsy diagnosis, which never felt right. We clung to it anyway, hoping it explained what was happening. When the truth came, it was like being hit by a truck – absolute devastation.

My husband is a fixer. His career was in change management and leadership, and he ran his own company. His motto was, “Every day is race day.” He wove dragon boating into corporate culture, showing people how to move forward together. Now I ask myself daily: how do I and our children find that same strength?

I knew Parkinson's disease would change our lives, but it was harder than I expected

The first loss was his career in health care. But instead of giving up, he found purpose at a community centre, supporting kids. One day, when a child noticed his shirt was on backward, Andrew smiled and said, “It's backward day.” That moment taught me perspective: I must adapt, separate the disease from him and let go of anger and love my new person.

Unlike typical dementia, PCA primarily affects visual-spatial awareness. From the outside, Andrew looks fine. But everything has changed. He often bumps into walls, can't tell if he's holding something and can no longer read or write. He relies on voice-to-text. I still remember the first, traumatizing appointment with a neurologist saying, “As the caregiver, know that this disease will not make him aggressive, because of where the changes are happening in his brain.”

Caregiver? I didn't want that word. The shift from wife to caregiver was instant and soul crushing.

I've been approved for MAID. And now I must figure out when

My husband refuses to let his diagnosis define him. He rejoined a dragon boat team and when that became impossible, he turned to improv acting. He is an eternal optimist. If you asked him how he is, he'd say, “Great!” Sometimes that optimism makes me want to scream, but mostly I'm inspired by it.

At the same time, my heart aches most for our children. Their dad can no longer read bedtime stories, help with homework or walk easily through crowded spaces. Stairs terrify him; he perceives them as shifting beneath his feet. I find myself constantly on alert so he doesn't lose sight of me. Yet he can articulately describe his world with remarkable clarity.

To help friends understand, we share a short video, Do You See What I See? on Rare Dementia Canada's website. It mirrors his experience so closely that when our youngest saw it, he said, “Dad, I finally understand you.”

Daily life is full of surreal moments. Once, he held up an empty hand and asked, “What do you want me to do with this lime?” When I said, “What lime?” he replied, “Oh, it disappeared.” Objects vanish. Shoes go missing. Getting dressed is very difficult. In winter he may stand frozen in the rain, unable to put on his coat. I've placed red stickers around the house as cues, but it is still overwhelming.

Only about five per cent of Alzheimer's patients have PCA, yet its impact is profound. There are few supports. Most groups cater to older people with different symptoms. I work full-time and online groups meet during the day. My husband feels isolated, too, without peers who understand.

Recently, we took a canoe out on the river near our home. I quickly realized it was no longer safe. He couldn't judge how to get in, couldn't paddle as before, sometimes not even knowing if his paddle touched the water. My heart broke. It was in a canoe in Algonquin Provincial Park where I first told him I loved him. To lose that was another devastating loss. Yet as we sat there, I realized: we are still a team, navigating uncharted waters. The river mirrors Alzheimer's. The river is unstable, like the illness. Each stroke is uncertain. But still, you paddle forward – one stroke, then another. Some days are easier, others harder but you keep moving.

My caregiving is about creating a safe home for someone who may go blind. It is a journey of grief, resilience, love and humour – magical moments keep us afloat.

Dementia is not one story – it is many stories. More research is desperately needed into PCA, and care models must evolve to support patients and their partners.

This journey is not what I wanted, but it is ours. Like the river, we keep moving forward with the race against time.

A powerful 6.3 magnitude earthquake shook northern Afghanistan before dawn Monday, killing at least 20 people and injuring more than 640 others, as well as damaging the historic Blue Mosque, officials said.

The numbers of people killed or injured could rise, officials said.

In the town of Khulm, near the epicentre, people dug through the rubble of collapsed mud brick homes with shovels and picked through debris to salvage what belongings they could.

Local resident Ahmad Zia said the air was polluted from all the dust that rose from the ruins of houses. “We pulled the bodies of two people from the rubble, and their funerals will be held today,” he said.

Footage on social media from Mazar-e-Sharif, the capital of northern Balkh province, showed several bricks had fallen from the walls of the Blue Mosque but the structure remained intact. The centuries-old site, one of Afghanistan's most revered religious landmarks, is a major gathering place during Islamic and cultural festivals.

The impoverished country often faces difficulty in responding to such natural disasters, especially in remote regions. Buildings tend to be low-rise constructions, mostly of concrete and brick, with homes in rural and outlying areas made from mud bricks and wood, many poorly built.

In August, a quake in eastern Afghanistan killed more than 2,200 people.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake's epicentre was located 22 kilometres west-southwest of the town of Khulm, and that it struck at 12:59 a.m. at a depth of 28 kilometres.

The deputy spokesman for Afghanistan's National Disaster Management Authority, Qari Taj Mohammad Hemat, said the earthquake had struck Balkh, Samangan, Sar-e-Pul, and Kunduz provinces and had left 20 people dead and 643 others injured, of whom 25 were in critical condition.

Earlier, Sharafat Zaman, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Health, said the dead and more than 500 of the injured had been brought to hospitals in Balkh and Samangan provinces. Rescuers were on the scene and the figures were changing, he added.

In the nearby province of Badakhshan, the quake partially or completely destroyed 800 houses in one village in the Shahr-e-Bozorg district, said Ihsanullah Kamgar, spokesperson for the provincial police headquarters. But with a lack of internet in the remote area, there were still no accurate casualty figures, he added.

Yousaf Hammad, a spokesman for Afghanistan's disaster management agency, said most of the injured suffered minor wounds and were discharged after treatment.

Another resident, Abdul Mubin, said he had been sleeping in his shop when the earthquake struck. “I saw that everything was destroyed. People had suffered a lot of financial losses,” he said. “Many people's houses were destroyed and their household goods were under the rubble.”

The Ministry of Defense announced that rescue and emergency teams had reached the quake areas in Balkh and Samangan, which suffered the most damage. The teams were transporting the injured and assisting others, it said.

The Taliban government's chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, posted on X that the earthquake caused casualties and financial loss. He said government organizations were working to get the help needed.

The quake was also felt in Kabul and several other provinces. The Defence Ministry said a rock slide briefly blocked a main mountain highway linking Kabul with Mazar-e-Sharif, but the road was later reopened. It said some people who were injured and trapped along the highway were transported to the hospital.

In Islamabad, Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his deep sorrow and grief over the loss of lives. In a statement, he offered condolences to the families of the victims, prayed for the swift recovery of the injured, and said that Pakistan stands with the Afghan people in this difficult time.

His statement came as the two countries were engaged in rounds of peace talks amid heightened tension after deadly clashes on the frontier between Afghanistan and Pakistan left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead on both sides. Pakistan accuses the Taliban government of sheltering members of the Pakistani Taliban and failing to curb cross-border attacks. Afghan officials reject the allegations, saying they seek good relations. Another round of peace talks is scheduled for this week in Istanbul, Turkey.

The United Nations in Afghanistan said on X that its teams were on the ground assessing needs and delivering urgent aid.

“We stand with the affected communities and will provide the necessary support,” the post said.

A magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit eastern Afghanistan on Aug. 31 near the border with Pakistan, killing more than 2,200 people. On Oct. 7, 2023, a magnitude 6.3 quake followed by strong aftershocks left at least 4,000 people dead, according to the Taliban government.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Germany: Military chief wants draft checks for all young men","https://www.dw.com/en/germany-news-military-chief-wants-draft-checks-for-all-young-men/live-74592710","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 15:52:04 GMT","

Germany's armed forces chief has rejected calls for a draft lottery, saying all young men should first be assessed. Meanwhile, police are probing a suspected bomb plot after arresting a man. DW has the latest.

Armed forces chief Carsten Breuer has dismissed proposals for a draft lottery, saying all young men should first be assessed to determine eligibility for military service.

Joining an ongoing national debate, he told the RND media group that screening entire age groups was vital to know who could serve.

Breuer argued that a random draw would hurt motivation and training quality.

Meanwhile, German police are continuing their investigation after a 22-year-old Syrian man was arrested and accused of plotting a bomb attack.

Here are the latest headlines from Germany on Monday, November 3:

More than half of 18- to 24-year-olds voted for the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD), the socialist Left Party, or the populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) in Germany's 2025 federal election — and a new study suggests those parties benefited most from social media algorithms during the campaign.

According to the Bertelsmann Foundation, the AfD and the Left Party content appeared disproportionately often in young users' feeds on TikTok, Instagram, X and YouTube.

While the AfD posts made up 21.5% of all official party videos, it appeared in 37.4% of feeds among users aged 21 to 25. Die Linke increased its share from 9.7% of posted videos to 27.6% of those displayed.

The BSW also gained visibility, with its videos shown in 8.3% of feeds despite accounting for just 3.1% of posts. By contrast, the business-focused Free Democratic Party (FDP) fared worst — its 7.6% of content appeared in only 1.4% of feeds.

AfD videos were also displayed the fastest — on TikTok within about 11 to 12 minutes of a new profile being created — compared with the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) videos, which appeared after around 70 minutes. Hashtags related to the AfD made up more than half of all party-linked tags on TikTok and Instagram.

The study, conducted with the University of Potsdam, analyzed data from 268 user profiles between January 22 and February 23, 2025, reviewing 1,763 official party and politician accounts.

The president of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, has called for a higher retirement age, warning that Germany's prosperity cannot be maintained without longer working lives.

""We have to be honest with ourselves, even if it's uncomfortable,"" Joachim Nagel told Table.Briefings. ""Germany is an aging society, and we must work longer to preserve the wealth that generations have built since World War II.""

Nagel said competitiveness was at stake, adding that failure to reform could cause Germany and Europe to fall behind. He has repeatedly urged faster structural reforms, including a later pension start.

Despite current weakness, Nagel expressed cautious optimism about the outlook. He said the economy could soon return to moderate growth if government spending on future-oriented investments is well targeted. ""We will certainly see more growth next year,"" he said.

Germany's economy remains in its deepest crisis in decades, with only minimal growth expected in 2025 after contractions in 2023 and 2024. Stronger expansion is forecast for 2026, driven by large-scale public spending on infrastructure and defense.

Nagel rejected criticism that the planned fiscal stimulus might be inefficient, saying it was too early to judge.

""The government is aware of its responsibility,"" he said, adding that the package's effects would take time to materialize.

Germany's foreign minister has spoken by phone with his Chinese counterpart after his planned visit to Beijing was canceledat short notice.

A foreign ministry spokesperson in Berlin said Johann Wadephul and China's Wang Yi agreed the visit should be rescheduled soon. The Chinese side also renewed invitations to Chancellor Friedrich Merz and extended one to the German head of state, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

Wadephul's trip was postponed in late October after Beijing failed to confirm meetings beyond talks with Wang. The spokesperson said both ministers stressed that stable German-Chinese relations remain in both countries' interest and agreed to stay in close contact on security, foreign policy, and trade issues.

Women remain markedly underrepresented in executive positions across Germany, with only 29.1% of leadership roles held by women in 2024, according to figures published by the Federal Statistical Office.

About 1.32 million men and 540,000 women occupied management positions in 2024, leaving Germany well below the EU average of 35.2% leadership roles filled by women. Sweden led the bloc with 44.4% female representation, followed by Latvia (43.4%) and Poland (41.8%). 

Germany's share of female managers has barely changed in a decade, rising only 0.1 percentage points since 2014. Over the same period, the EU average increased by 3.4 points, with the largest gains seen in Sweden, Estonia, Cyprus, and Malta.

That means that Germany ranked sixth from bottom among all EU states, trailed only by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, Croatia and Cyprus. 

The disparity is notable given Germany's near-equal overall employment rate between women and men. Women accounted for 46.9% of the workforce in 2024 — slightly above the EU average — yet remain underrepresented in leadership.

Management roles in the data include company executives, department heads, and senior public-sector officials.

Investigators in Berlin have been searching for more clues after the arrest of a 22-year-old Syrian man accused of planning a bomb attack.

Prosecutors said electronic storage devices and other materials seized during searches at three locations in the city were being analyzed. ""The next step is the evaluation of the electronic data and remaining evidence,"" said prosecutor's office spokesman Michael Petzold.

The suspect was arrested on Saturday and has been in pretrial detention since Sunday evening, accused of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the state. Officials said he had obtained parts for a homemade explosive or incendiary device, though details about a potential target remain unclear.

The man had come to investigators' attention for sharing Islamic State propaganda on social media, including jihadist songs and hymns. Prosecutors have also charged him with spreading materials of unconstitutional and terrorist organizations.

Speculation that a Berlin Christmas market may have been a target has not been confirmed. Petzold said the investigation is exploring all possibilities.

The case has reignited political debate over deportations to Syria. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has said he aims to reach an agreement with Damascus this year to enable the return of offenders and rejected asylum seekers. Conservative Christian Democrat lawmaker Günter Krings called for the swift deportation of convicted terrorists, saying those who plan attacks ""forfeit their right to stay.""

Germany's armed forces chief has rejected the idea of a draft lottery in the ongoing debate over reintroducing military service, saying all young men should undergo assessment to determine eligibility.

General Inspector Carsten Breuer told Germany's RND media group that, from a military standpoint, it was essential to screen entire age groups. ""Only then do we know who is available and whom we could call upon in a defense situation — one we want to prevent,"" he said.

Breuer argued that drawing lots after screening would bring in recruits by chance rather than motivation, making training less effective. If not enough volunteers come forward, he said the Bundeswehr should select those who are ""especially qualified and motivated,"" targeting skills such as IT expertise rather than relying on random selection.

He said a voluntary model would likely attract more recruits, provided that service is seen as meaningful and appealing.

The Bundestag is currently debating a new military service law. Within the ruling coalition, disagreement remains over what steps to take if voluntary enlistment fails to meet the Bundeswehr's personnel needs.

Adding his voice to an ongoing debate, Germany's armed forces chief has dismissed the idea of using a lottery to reintroduce military service.

General Inspector Carsten Breuer has said all young men should first be assessed for eligibility.

Breuer said screening full age groups was vital to know who could serve if needed, amid an increasingly perceived threat from Russia.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","North Koreans left in the dark as foreign broadcasts cut","https://www.dw.com/en/north-koreans-left-in-the-dark-as-foreign-broadcasts-cut/a-74596803","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 12:56:15 GMT","

For decades, US and South Korean broadcasts were a critical source of information for North Koreans willing to learn about life beyond their borders. Now, the airwaves have gone silent. 

The US and South Korean governments have halted the operations of media organizations that were broadcasting into North Korea, leaving tens of thousands of residents of the world's most isolated country in the dark about what is happening in the outside world.

""This is very bad for the people of North Korea and a really serious setback for human rights there,"" said Kim Eu-jin, who fled the North with her mother and sister in the 1990s.

""The governments are denying the people of North Korea the freedom to access information and now all they will hear is Pyongyang's propaganda,"" she told DW.

Previously, North Koreans could surreptitiously tune in to Radio Free Asia (RFA) and Voice of America (VOA) from the US, as well as South Korea's ""Voice of Freedom"" broadcasts. Activists have said the broadcasts helped North Koreans endure hardship by allowing them to hear things the regime does not want them to know.

Kim said she never listened to foreign radio broadcasts before she defected because it was simply too dangerous to do so. The regime in Pyongyang was willing to to invest a lot of time and effort in catching and punishing people who accessed foreign media. In some cases, those caught would be tried publicly and sentenced to hard labor or, in some extreme cases, to death.

Kim said that the North Korean government fears those broadcasts, and warned that dangers for those who listen to foreign media have become significantly more serious in recent years.

Voice of America has been silenced effectively since Donald Trump returned to the White House earlier this year. The new administration quickly fired hundreds of staff and issued an executive order to eliminate VOA's and Radio Free Asia's parent agency, the US Agency for Global Media.

In late August, the South Korean government announced that it was halting broadcasts of Voice of Freedom into the North after 15 years.

Huge loudspeaker systems on the border that had blasted news and South Korean pop music into the North have also been dismantled.

The South Korean government said it was trying to reduce tensions with the North and expressed hope that the regime in Pyongyang might, in turn, be willing to reopen negotiations with the South. There have been no indications to date that the North is contemplating resuming talks with Seoul.

On October 29, a message from Rosa Hwang, executive editor of Radio Free Asia, stated her broadcaster was halting work due to ""uncertain funding"" — for the first time in RFA's 29-year history.

""The newsroom is dark. The microphones are off. Broadcasts have been silenced. Publishing is paused. On social media. On our websites.""

""Without RFA Korean, 26 million North Koreans isolated by the repressive regime's war on free speech and a free press will lack a critical link to independent information,"" she said, pointing to the broadcaster's award-winning coverage of the plight of North Korean defectors.

In October, the 38 North website, which analyzes North Korean affairs, held an event to explore the impact of the radio and television beamed into the North.

It showed that anti-regime radio broadcasts are down by 85% and television programming has disappeared entirely since the US and South Korean governments' cuts.

And while it is difficult to determine just how many people the broadcasts were reaching, the analysts emphasized again that the ""significant effort and resources spent by the North Korean regime to block them provides some indication of their penetration.""

The North has become more adept at jamming broadcasts and the coronavirus pandemic made it harder to smuggle USB sticks and memory cards into the country.

However, enhanced legal restrictions from Pyongyang — such as the Anti-Reactionary Thought and Culture Law, passed in 2020 — shows how seriously Pyongyang is taking this threat to its authority, according to the experts participating in the 38 North event.

""I am sure the government in Pyongyang is very happy at this development,"" said Lim Eun-jung, a professor of international studies at Kongju National University.

""Halting these broadcasts means the people there only have North Korean state media to listen to now and they will know less and less about what is happening in the outside world,"" she told DW.

""In one sense, I can understand the South Korean government's decision as it did not want tensions to escalate further and hoped to open lines of communication with the North, but at the same time this means that people living in a country that is already essentially a prison now have even less access to information.""

North Korean defector Kim said that, while foreign broadcasts did not play a large part in her own defection three decades ago, they later grew to become a critical tool against the regime.

""The broadcasts taught people in North Korea what human rights are,"" she said. ""It told them what freedom is. For some, it made them fight for that freedom by leaving the North. I cannot understand why we have done the regime's work for it by ending these broadcasts.""

Samia Suluhu Hassan's inauguration ceremony was moved to the country's State House, where the public was not in attendance. Last week's vote was marred by deadly protests and an internet blackout.

Samia Suluhu Hassan was sworn in as Tanzania's president on Monday, while internet services in the country remained blocked amid post-election protests that the opposition says left hundreds dead.

State television said the inauguration was held at the State House, which is not open to the public, instead of the usual venue, a stadium.

The country's electoral commission announced Hassan as the winner of the election with 98% of the vote. But the main opposition party, Chadema, labeled last week's vote a ""sham"" and called for fresh elections. The party was barred from participating in the vote.

The opposition has claimed that at least 800 people have been killed by Tanzania's security forces during protests that erupted after voting day last Wednesday.

The East African country has been under an internet blackout and nationwide curfew since Wednesday.

France's AFP news agency cited a diplomatic source who said there were credible reports of hundreds of deaths registered at hospitals and clinics across the country.

The source added there were ""concerning reports"" that local police were using the blackout to hunt down opposition leaders and activists who may have video evidence of last week's alleged killings.

AFP had earlier reported that local police were stopping nearly everyone and checking their bags and IDs.

Schools and universities remained closed on Monday, and public transport was also halted.

Meanwhile, Chadema called for the United Nations and the International Criminal Court to conduct independent investigations into the alleged killings. 

President Samia Suluhu Hassan of the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party entered the election seeking a second term in office — she assumed office in 2021 upon the death of President John Magufulia — virtually unopposed.

The Chadema party boycotted the poll after its leader, Tundu Lissu, was imprisoned.

The other opposition contender, Luhaga Mpina of the Alliance for Change and Transparency (ACT-Wazalendo), was disqualified by the Independent National Electoral Commission.

Sixteen opposition candidates representing smaller parties were on the ballot but did not to pose a challenge to Samia.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","The violence in Nigeria that Trump cites as a reason for military strikes is not limited to Christians","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/03/africa/trump-christian-killings-nigeria-intl","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 16:45:46 GMT","


            US President Donald Trump caused alarm across Nigeria over the weekend when he said he was contemplating military action in Africa's most populous nation in response to what he claimed was a “mass slaughter” of Christians by Islamist insurgents.
    


            The reality on the ground, experts and analysts say, is a more complex and nuanced one. Both Christians and Muslims — the two main religious groups in the country of more than 230 million people — have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists, they say.
    


            The West African nation has grappled for years with deep-rooted security problems that are driven by various factors, including religiously motivated attacks. Observers say other violent conflicts arise from communal and ethnic tensions, as well as disputes between farmers and herders over limited access to land and water resources.
    


            The Nigerian government rejects claims that it is not doing enough to protect Christians from violence, saying it was bewildered by Trump's suggestion of a potential military intervention.
    


            “We are shocked that President Trump is mulling an invasion of our country,” Nigerian presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga told CNN after the US president instructed the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action.
    


            Additionally, Trump threatened to stop all US aid to Nigeria if its government fails to take steps to stop the killings of Christians. He warned that the proposed intervention would be “fast and vicious,” aimed at eliminating the “Islamic Terrorists” he said were responsible for these atrocities.
    


            As Trump's war threats echo among Nigerians, his assertion that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” has provoked strong reactions from many within the country.
    


            Nigeria has nearly equal numbers of Christians and Muslims, with the northern region predominantly Muslim and the southern region largely Christian.
    


            In 2012, the Islamist group Boko Haram issued an ultimatum, ordering Christians in the northern region to leave while calling on Muslims in the south to “come back” to the north.
    


            John Joseph Hayab, a pastor who leads the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the country's northern region, where attacks by Islamist groups are prevalent, told CNN that he agrees with Trump's claim of “systematic killings of Christians” in that area. However, he added, “there has been a little shift in the last two years,” with the scale of the killings reducing.
    


            Hayab said he had presided over numerous mass burials of slain Christians, stating that “every state in northern Nigeria has suffered its own terrible share of killings targeting Christians.”
    


Trump says he's ordered Pentagon to ‘prepare for possible action' in Nigeria



            He urged the Nigerian government to acknowledge the issue and take measures to correct the killings rather than deny them.
    


            “We have raised this matter dozens of times, but nobody hears us,” he claimed, acknowledging the role of US Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in bringing attention to reports of alleged Christian persecution in Nigeria.
    


            In August, the Republican senator introduced a bill calling for sanctions against Nigeria for purported violations of religious freedom.
    


            Some analysts argue that while Christians have been targeted by Boko Haram and other Islamist groups seeking to impose their extreme interpretation of Islamic law, Muslims, including those considered moderate, have also been victims of those groups.
    


            Bulama Bukarti, a Nigerian human rights advocate specializing in security and development, disputed Trump's comments, telling CNN that they “reflect a dangerous oversimplification of Nigeria's complex security crisis.”
    


            He stated: “The claim that there is a ‘mass slaughter of Christians' by ‘Islamic radicals' distorts the reality on the ground and risks deepening divisions in a country already under immense strain.”
    


            Northern Nigeria has witnessed horrific killings targeting religious groups this year. In April, gunmen believed to be Muslim herders, killed at least 40 people, including children, in a predominantly Christian farming village, the Associated Press reported.
    


            Two months later, more than 100 people were massacred by attackers in Yelwata, a largely Christian community in Benue state, also in the north-central, according to Amnesty International.
    


            Pope Leo XIV offered prayers for the victims of the Yelwata attack, many of whom were “internally displaced persons sheltered by a local Catholic mission,” a Vatican news report said.
    


            Outside the northern region, such targeted killings are rare. A a mass shooting at a church in Owo, a community in southwestern Nigeria, left dozens dead in 2022. Court filings seen by Reuters linked the suspects in the Owo massacre to al-Shabaab, a militant group affiliated with al-Qaeda operating in East Africa.
    


            Muslims have also been victims of targeted killings this year. In August, at least 50 worshippers were killed — some shot, others burned alive — when gunmen attacked a mosque in the north-western Katsina State, Reuters reported.
    


            Many similarly brutal attacks have been carried out in Muslim communities by Boko Haram and other armed groups in Nigeria's predominantly Muslim north.
    


            “Yes, these (extremist) groups have sadly killed many Christians. However, they have also massacred tens of thousands of Muslims,” Bukarti said. He noted that “the groups' attacks on other civilian locations such as markets, bus stops and refugee camps (disproportionately) harm Muslims,” as the states where the radical groups operate are predominantly Muslim.
    


            “Mr. Trump's rhetoric (suggesting a mass slaughter of Christians) not only misinforms the international community but also risks fuelling extremist propaganda and undermining local efforts to build peace,” he added.
    


            Claims that Christians are being disproportionately targeted by extremists in Nigeria are not supported by what little data is available.
    


            Armed Conflict Location & Event Data, a crisis-monitoring group, reported that more than 20,400 civilians were killed in attacks in Nigeria between January 2020 and September of this year. Among those casualties, 317 deaths were attributed to attacks targeting Christians, while 417 deaths were reported among Muslims, though the organization did not include the religious affiliation of the vast majority of the civilians killed.
    


            Security analyst Nnamdi Obasi, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group think tank, explained that while extremist groups have wreaked havoc against both Christians and Muslims in the northeast of Nigeria, bandit groups have terrorized predominantly Muslim communities in the northwest. Additionally, predominantly Christian farming communities in parts of the North Central zone have suffered persistent violence from armed groups.
    


            However, “in most parts of the country, Christians and Muslims live peacefully with each other,” he said. “Reports of widespread persecution and mass slaughter of Christians are seriously misread and exaggerate the challenges of interfaith relations in the country.”

            Ken Eluma Asogwa, a spokesperson for the opposition Labour Party, told CNN that “even though the government of Nigeria has been lackluster and shambolic in its approach to the protection of its citizens from murderous non-state actors operating under different aliases, there is no evidence to support Trump's claims that Christians are particularly targeted for extermination.”
    


            On Friday, Trump designated Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” under the US International Religious Freedom Act. The label is a suggestion that his administration has found that Nigeria has engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, (and) egregious violations of religious freedom.”
    


            Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has so far remained silent about Trump's mention of potential military intervention but pushed back against the designation, stating in a social media post that “the characterization of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.”
    


            Trump has not ruled out the possibility of sending US troops to Nigeria or launching airstrikes in the country, telling reporters on Sunday, “I envisage a lot of things.”
    


            But analyst Obasi said that any unilateral US military operation against Islamist groups in Nigeria would not address the underlying factors driving instability there.
    


            Such an intervention, he said, “without the involvement of Nigerian security forces, would be predictably unwelcome by many Nigerians and could further destabilize the country, aggravating its security situation.”
    


            Instead, he urged the Nigerian government to “intensify efforts to end the mass killings of citizens,” regardless of their religious or other identities, and to address religious extremism, tensions over resources and banditry, “which are the underlying drivers of most of the mass killings.”
    


            Bulama, the human rights advocate, believes the Nigerian government can address Trump's criticism by “moving beyond defensiveness.”
    


            “It should meet misinformation with data,” he suggested, adding that “this moment calls for candor, not posturing.”
    


            “Constructive dialogue, not social-media outrage, will best serve Nigeria's interests — and the cause of peace,” he advised.

            No, I did not prepare for the end of Daylight Saving Time this past weekend, when most US states set clocks back an hour. Sunrise and sunset now come an hour earlier, despite my protestations.
    


            Experts advised planning for this change two weeks ago by shifting your sleeping schedule a bit each night. That did not happen in my house, where the workdays were long, everyone's calendars were packed and a bad cold threw off our schedule for a week.
    


            While the shift technically provided one extra hour of sleep on Sunday, many people didn't feel that benefit. The sudden change can disrupt your body's internal clock, leaving you tired in the morning, wide awake at night and sluggish throughout the day.
    


Nighttime light exposure may be linked with top killer disease worldwide



            So what to do now that we've “fallen back”? How long does it take to adjust to standard time? Should I change how I sleep, eat or exercise during this transition to get back on track? How can adults help children adjust? What if the darker days ahead start affecting your mood?
    


            To help get adjusted, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore's health commissioner.
    


CNN: What happens to your body when the clocks change?



Dr. Leana Wen: Your internal clock, also called the circadian rhythm, is closely tied to light and darkness. When sunrise and sunset shift suddenly, your body's natural rhythm doesn't immediately keep up. Melatonin, the hormone that helps you feel sleepy, is still being released based on last week's light schedule. That's why you might find yourself wide awake later at night and struggling to get going in the morning.
    


            It's similar to jet lag, but instead of going across time zones, you're changing time zones while staying home. Even a one-hour time change can cause temporary misalignment in your sleep-wake cycle. That can lead to fatigue, reduced alertness and changes in appetite and mood. For people who already sleep poorly and are in sleep debt, the effect can feel magnified. Your body needs time, consistent routines and light cues to reset.
    


CNN: How long does it take to adjust to standard time?



Wen: Most people start to feel better within a few days, but some need up to a week or more to fully adapt.
    


            Children and teenagers may take longer to adjust since their circadian rhythms are naturally different from adults'. Teens tend to fall asleep later and wake up later, so early school start times combined with darker mornings can make them especially groggy. Parents may notice irritability, difficulty concentrating or early bedtime resistance during the first few days after the change. Older adults may also feel the impact more strongly because their melatonin rhythms shift earlier in the evening.
    


Daylight Saving Time is controversial. Here's why the US kept it



CNN: What can we do to get on track faster?



Wen: Consistent bedtimes and light exposure in the morning help you adjust faster regardless of your age.
    


            Keep your bedtime and wake-up time consistent, even on weekends if possible. Avoid naps and don't drink coffee or other caffeinated drinks in the afternoon or evening.
    


            These are all part of standard advice for good sleep hygiene, which also includes reducing screen use before bed and creating a regular evening routine, like reading or listening to calming music. A comfortable, cool and dark sleep environment can make a big difference as well since even small amounts of light, noise or discomfort can delay sleep onset.
    


            Specific to the time change, go outside or open the blinds right after waking up to signal to your brain that it's time to be alert. Light is a key regulator of your circadian rhythm, as it suppresses melatonin and helps shift your body clock to the new time. If you wake up before sunrise or work in a dark space, bright indoor lighting or a light therapy lamp used for 20 to 30 minutes in the morning can serve as an effective substitute.
    


These 3 exercises may help with insomnia, new study finds



CNN: Should I change how I eat or exercise during this transition?



Wen: It could help. Consistent mealtimes help your metabolism stay synchronized with your new wake-sleep schedule. Try to eat breakfast soon after waking, keep mealtimes regular, and avoid heavy meals right before bed.
    


            Exercise is another powerful cue for your body clock and an excellent way to improve sleep quality. Morning or afternoon workouts can help you feel more awake and improve your mood. Morning exercise may have the edge since it could also get you outdoors and exposed to natural light. It's still good for you to exercise even if you only have time later in the day. That's fine, though keep in mind that vigorous exercise within a few hours of bedtime can be too stimulating and make it harder to fall asleep.
    


            If you tend to crave sugary foods or caffeine to fight fatigue after the time change, try to step outside for a quick walk or get light exposure first. Both naturally increase alertness without disrupting sleep later.
    


CNN: Does losing daylight affect more than just sleep?



Wen: Yes. The shift to shorter days can negatively affect mood and energy levels, too. According to the US National Institutes of Health, less daylight exposure can slow production of serotonin, which is a brain chemical that supports mood. Many people experience a mild drop in energy or motivation during the late fall and winter, sometimes called the “winter blues.”
    


            For some, the change can trigger a more serious condition known as seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. It typically appears in late fall and peaks in midwinter, and it can cause persistent sadness, low energy and changes in appetite and sleep.
    


Seasonal affective disorder doesn't mean you have to be SAD. Here are 6 self-care tips to fight the blues



CNN: How can families help children adjust?



Wen: Consistency and light exposure are key here, too. Stick with familiar bedtime routines like bath, story and lights out, even if the bedtime is temporarily off. Avoid introducing new or longer naps; this can make it harder for kids to fall asleep at night and delay their adjustment.
    


            In the mornings, open window shades and turn on the lights as soon as kids wake up. Try to get them outside for a few minutes of fresh air and natural light before day care or school. That early light exposure helps reset their internal clock.
    


            If your child starts going to bed earlier than usual after the time change, they may also start waking earlier. Gradually shifting bedtime and wake-up time by 10 to 15 minutes over several nights can help smooth the transition and get everyone back on schedule.

CNN: When should someone seek help for sleep or mood issues after the time change?



Wen: If fatigue, poor sleep or low mood persist for more than two weeks, it's worth checking in with your primary care provider. Chronic sleep loss can affect heart health, immune function and mental well-being. Persistent trouble falling asleep or staying asleep can be a sign of insomnia or another sleep disorder.
    


            For mood changes, especially feelings of sadness or loss of interest in usual activities, your health care provider can screen for seasonal affective disorder or other causes. Treatment might include light therapy, counseling or short-term medication, depending on severity, duration and impact on your everyday life. Early support makes it easier to recover and may help prevent these patterns from recurring each year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Nuclear threats are worsening. Why?","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/nuclear-threats-worsening-mcgurk-analysis","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 11:00:02 GMT","


Brett McGurk is a CNN global affairs analyst who served in senior national security positions under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden.



            In the summer of 2022, I accompanied President Joe Biden to a summit in Saudi Arabia with leaders from across the Middle East. During a working session, someone asked Biden to name one issue that kept him up at night.
    


            Without flinching, Biden said nuclear war.
    


            I was surprised by the answer, because the threat-of-all-threats had seemed contained over the recent decades. But at the time, with Europe on the front end of a war launched by Russia, a nuclear-armed power, the erosion of nuclear arms control arrangements, together with the rise of artificial intelligence and a burgeoning nuclear arms race with China, it's a surprise the issue had not received more attention given the stakes.
    


            Biden later told CNN's Jake Tapper that Russian miscalculations in Ukraine “could all end in Armageddon,” though he said the risks remained low at the time.
    


            Fast forward to this past week. The most-watched movie on Netflix is “A House of Dynamite,” about a nuclear missile heading for Chicago and evading air defenses. Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw nuclear exercises, including a new missile system that can strike anywhere on Earth. In response, President Donald Trump ordered “immediate” renewal of nuclear weapons tests after a three-decade moratorium. Russia threatened to do the same.
    


            What is going on?  Let's try to make sense of things.
    


            Against the backdrop of these headlines is the steady erosion of arms control agreements that trace back to the Cold War. The centerpiece of this framework is known as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, which when signed in 1991 reversed an arms race between the US and the Soviet Union, mandating the reduction of nuclear arsenals together with inspection and verification in both countries.
    


            START was agreed to shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union but was later expanded in a 2010 agreement between the United States and Russia to further reduce arsenals and maintain verification in both countries. This deal, known as New START, was extended for five years — through February 2026 — in the early months of Biden's presidency.
    


            Then came the Ukraine war, after which Russia suspended its participation in the treaty and blocked American inspectors from its nuclear facilities. Hopes of renewing the treaty or negotiating further extensions have remained dormant ever since.
    


            While Russia claims to still be complying with its obligations, the treaty expires altogether in three months, and there are no signs of work to negotiate a new accord. The demise of START would remove the last remaining arms control treaty between the world's leading nuclear powers. Trump's aversion to international agreements and perceived unfairness in such accords toward US interests makes new arrangements further unlikely.
    


            So, while the risk of a nuclear exchange may remain low, the world is entering an era not seen since the Cold War, with a potential free-for-all expansion of nuclear weapons by the two leading nuclear powers (accounting for 90% of all deployable weapons systems), as well as by countries not yet in the nuclear club.
    


            South Korea, faced with a nuclear armed adversary to the north and questions over American security guarantees, has debated the merits of acquiring its own nuclear capability. Saudi Arabia has long warned that it will obtain a nuclear weapon absent American security guarantees in the event Iran ever does the same and recently signed a mutual defense pact with Pakistan, a nuclear armed power.
    


            Extending the US nuclear deterrence umbrella to Saudi Arabia may be a topic when the Saudi crown prince visits Washington later this month for meetings with Trump.
    


            While nuclear arms control agreements like START curbed the expansion of American and Russian nuclear arsenals, there has never been such an agreement in place for China. Given Beijing's adversarial positioning, Trump has a fair point in making clear that the US will keep pace and remain ahead of both Russia and China.
    


            China's nuclear arsenal is growing by approximately 100 new warheads per year, faster than any other country. According to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Beijing now possesses 600 nuclear weapons, together with advanced missile delivery systems that can strike the US. These experts predict that China may possess 1,500 nuclear weapons by 2035, with strike capabilities from land, sea, and air (known as a full nuclear triad).
    


            While the country is a recognized nuclear power under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or NPT, it has never engaged in serious arms control talks to curtail its buildup.
    


            Beijing argues its nuclear stockpile pales in comparison to the US or Russia (each with over 5,000 warheads) and thus it should not be treated similarly as it goes about a rapid nuclear expansion. This argument cuts against the spirit of nuclear non-proliferation that undergirds the NPT system. It also calls the entire system of strategic stability that START established further into doubt, heralding an expansion of nuclear arsenals and nuclear-armed powers, together with heightening risk of mistrust and miscalculation.
    


            Even at best, therefore, the world is entering an uncharted era of expanding nuclear arsenals without any of the traditional guardrails that have existed for decades.
    


            Now, add the entry of artificial intelligence into decision-making and military analysis, and the world may also be moving perilously closer to a once-fictional “Doomsday Machine” scenario from Stanley Kubrick's “Dr. Strangelove” (1964). That machine contained an automatic nuclear launch program outside human control under certain conditions, an absurdity created by humans to ensure their own destruction without human input.
    


            This is no longer fictional.
    


            Only last year, when Biden met Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the two “affirmed the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons,” according to the White House readout of the meeting. This principle for humans and not AI to control nuclear use in all circumstances might seem obvious, but it's not backed by any treaty or formal agreement.
    


            Even if human judgment controls a decision at launch, machine judgments are being integrated into analysis cycles, compressing timeframes in a crisis, with risks of miscalculations driven by AI modeling as opposed to human judgment.
    


            While the risk should not be overstated, Ukraine remains the current flashpoint.
    


            Trump's order last week to renew nuclear tests came in response to Putin's provocatively overseeing nuclear exercises, including the launch of missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads and reaching the US. Moscow claimed the exercises were routine, but the timing and saber-rattling came after Trump poured cold water on a rumored second summit with Putin, as well as Russia's failure to gain new ground on the battlefield in Ukraine.
    


            This is not the first time that Putin has brandished a nuclear threat over his flailing military campaign in Ukraine. In February 2024, Putin warned that “NATO nations assisting Ukraine … genuinely poses a risk of a conflict involving nuclear arms, which would lead to the annihilation of civilization.” This past summer, Russia's former president and deputy chair of its security council, Dmitry Medvedev, warned Trump on continuing US support for Ukraine and pointed to Russia's nuclear strike capacity. In response, Trump ordered the deployment of submarines carrying nuclear weapons toward Russia.
    


            Trump has been right to call Moscow's rhetorical bluff, while keeping diplomatic channels open toward a ceasefire together with support for Ukraine. However, the exchange of words together with exercises and deployments should heighten the concern about any further proliferation of nuclear weapons in a polarized environment.
    


            All the above demonstrates that there is something to the recent headlines on nuclear weapons and popular movies about a loose nuke poised to annihilate Chicago. The risks of a nuclear exchange are small but increasing. Earlier this year, what is known as the “Doomsday Clock,” a predictor of nuclear catastrophe set by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, was moved to the closest point since its inception in 1947.
    


            So, Trump is right to clearly identify this most serious problem, and to make clear that the US will not sit idle as its adversaries expand their own nuclear capabilities. Investments in our own systems must ensure a deterrent to any thought of using a nuclear weapon by anyone and under any circumstance. Congress earlier this year mandated an increase in spending to modernize and maintain our nuclear arsenal considering China's advances and tensions with Russia. That's right to do. Maintaining nuclear deterrence has served the world and the US well for over 75 years and must continue.
    


            Washington might also consider extending its nuclear deterrence umbrella to countries not within our web of mutual defense treaties, such as Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. Such a move together with ensuring a country like Iran never obtains a weapon reduces risks of proliferation, as the American umbrella renders further expansion of new nuclear powers unnecessary. At the same time, Washington can coordinate with partners around the world on new restrictions, particularly on the use of AI in command systems, and calling on Beijing to curb its own rapid and unnecessary expansion of nuclear warheads.
    


            New explosive tests would not help this equation. Moscow carried out its last test in 1990. Washington in 1992. Beijing in 1996. The moment the U.S. conducts an explosive test, Russia and China would surely do the same, removing another brick from the non-proliferation system. Nor are new tests needed to maintain readiness and modernization of the US nuclear arsenal. This is one nuclear genie to keep locked in the bottle.
    


            Trump's nominee to oversee US Strategic Command, which is responsible for the global command and control of nuclear weapons, seems to agree. In questioning before the Senate Armed Services Committee about Trump's apparent order to renew nuclear tests on an “equal basis” with China and Russia, Vice Adm. Richard Correll answered, “Neither China nor Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test. So, I'm not reading anything into that or reading anything out.” Trump should drop this idea.
    


            Note: In breaking news, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright late Sunday further walked back Trump's apparent order, saying any tests would be standard “systems tests,” and “not nuclear explosions.” But Trump, in an interview with 60 Minutes aired after Wright but recorded earlier, suggested China and Russia are carrying out secret nuclear tests, requiring the US to do the same.
    


            While there is no reported indication of China or Russia secretly exploding nuclear bombs, Trump could ask the Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) if both China and Russia do the same. The CTBT has sat dormant in the Senate since the late 1990s. Russia was a signatory but withdrew in 2023. China like the US was a signatory but never ratified the accord.
    


            This would be a better approach, perhaps even worthy of a Nobel Prize, than renewing explosive tests.
    


            The world is entering an unmapped era of nuclear risk. The answer is not new explosive tests, but a coordinated campaign with allies and partners to maximize deterrence against any conceivable use, while working to establish new norms against further expansion of nuclear weapons and managing the use of AI in decision-making systems. A new era of risk demands new arrangements and standards, which as of now, are nowhere in sight.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Democrats are more enthusiastic about the midterms as Trump's approval hits a second-term low, CNN poll finds","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/cnn-poll-democrats-trump-midterms","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT","


            One year out from the midterm elections, the Democratic Party holds a sizable enthusiasm advantage as views of President Donald Trump dip further into negative territory, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS.
    


            The fall of 2025 is not a replay of 2017, the year before the Democrats captured control of the US House in Trump's first term. The Democrats' 5-point advantage among registered voters in the generic congressional ballot falls short of the 11-point edge they held in CNN polling a year before the 2018 midterms. And favorable views of the party still stand near all-time lows as they have throughout this year, 8 points below where they were in the fall of Trump's first year in office.
    


            In a midterm election year, though, views of the president can outweigh perceptions of the opposition party. Trump's approval rating in the poll stands at 37%, the worst of his second term in CNN polling and roughly equivalent to his 36% approval rating at this point in his first term.
    


            And his disapproval rating, at 63%, is numerically the highest of either term, one point above the previous high of 62% as he was leaving office in January 2021.
    


CNN's Poll of Polls average, which puts Trump's approval rating a few points higher at 41% as of Sunday, charts a similar trend since January. Approval of the president has dipped across partisan and demographic lines since the summer in CNN's polling.
    


            Looking ahead  to next year's midterms, Democrats appear to have a very early advantage: 47% of registered voters say they'd vote for the Democrat in their district if the election were held today, while 42% prefer the Republican. More say they've ruled out supporting a Republican (42%) than say the same about a Democrat (35%). And 41% say they would be sending a message that they oppose Trump with their vote, nearly double the 21% who say their vote would be a message of support for the president. Independents break in Democrats' favor on the generic ballot (44% to 31% for Republicans, with 19% saying they wouldn't pick either right now).
    


            Registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents are far more likely than Republican-aligned voters to say they are extremely motivated to vote next year (67% compared with 46%). Those Democratic-aligned voters who consider the state of democracy to be a top concern are perhaps the most fired up within the party: 82% in that group say they are deeply motivated to vote, compared with 57 % among Democratic-aligned voters who call the economy their top concern.
    


            CNN's poll results suggest that the Democratic Party's ongoing internal image troubles may not necessarily translate into defections at the ballot box. Democratic-aligned voters remain far less fond of their own party (65% have a favorable view of the Democratic Party) than Republican-aligned voters (80% have a favorable view of the GOP), but even those Democratic-aligned voters with a negative view of the party are almost universally behind the Democratic candidate in their district (93%) and broadly motivated to vote (71% say they are extremely motivated).
    


            All told, Democrats hold a 12-point advantage among those voters who say they are extremely or very motivated to turn out next year.
    


            Americans are broadly dissatisfied with the state of the country (68% say things are going badly) and the economy (72% say it's in poor shape, and 47% call the economy and cost of living the top issue facing the US). About 6 in 10 (61%) say Trump's policies have worsened economic conditions in the US.
    


            Roughly 8 in 10 consider the federal government shutdown a crisis (31%) or a major problem (50%), and 61% disapprove of Trump's handling of it. Nearly as many disapprove of the way each party's congressional leadership is handling it (58% disapprove of each). Taken all together, about 9 in 10 American disapprove of at least one of those three players on the shutdown.
    


            A majority hold negative views of Trump's performance on several other key issues: most (56%) feel that his foreign policy decisions have hurt America's standing in the world and 57% say he's gone too far deporting immigrants living in the US illegally.
    


            About a quarter of Americans (26%) say the state of US democracy is the top issue facing the nation, and it is the top issue among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (45% say it's the most important issue, with the economy and cost of living at 38%).
    


            Americans are increasingly likely to say Trump has gone too far in using the power of the presidency – 61% say so, up 9 points since February. On his teardown of the East Wing of the White House, 54% of the public is dissatisfied or angry, with just 10% saying they're satisfied with or happy about that decision. Another 36% (including nearly half of Republicans) say it doesn't matter much to them.
    


            Most Americans also see the Republicans who control Congress as doing too much to support Trump (55%, up from 48% who felt that way in February). But the GOP base is pleased: Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are largely satisfied with the level of support the GOP in Congress provides to Trump (63% say it's the right amount, about the same as in February).
    


            On the Democratic side, though, views are more divided and party support less clear. Four in 10 say the Democrats in Congress aren't doing enough to oppose Trump, and among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 69% feel that way.
    


            The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS online and by phone from October 27 to 30 among a random national sample of 1,245 adults, including 954 registered voters. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points; it is plus or minus 3.6 points for results among registered voters.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Big business sits out the Supreme Court fight over Donald Trump's tariffs","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/big-business-supreme-court-trump-tariffs","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 10:00:01 GMT","


            It's one of the most significant economic cases to reach the Supreme Court in years – the blockbuster battle over President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs – but the nation's largest companies are sitting on the sidelines.
    


            The battle to stop Trump's tariffs is being waged by a group of small businesses – including a family-owned toymaker in Illinois and a New York-based wine importer. They have advanced the case to the nation's highest court even as their larger and better-known competitors have remained notably silent.
    


            The lack of public input from major US companies on the docket of a Supreme Court appeal with potentially vast consequences for their bottom line and the economy as a whole is unusual and likely based at least in part on a fear of retribution from the White House, multiple people involved with the case and outside experts said.
    


Trump tariffs decision rests on arguments conservatives repeatedly used against Biden



            The Supreme Court hears arguments Wednesday in the case, which will determine the fate of Trump's “Liberation Day” tariffs as well as duties he has unilaterally imposed on imports from China, Mexico and Canada.
    


            Trump has made the tariffs, a response to trade imbalances and fentanyl trafficking, the centerpiece of his economic agenda.
    


            “I was shocked that those with much more power and money did not step up,” said Victor Owen Schwartz, the founder of V.O.S. Selections, the wine and spirits company that is one of the lead plaintiffs in the litigation.“So when I was afforded the opportunity to speak for small American business, I took it.”
    


            Trump has relied on a 1970s-era emergency law to reshape global trade and alliances with allies and adversaries. The law lets a president “regulate importation” during emergencies, but does not specifically mention tariffs. Relying on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Trump has rapidly turned some of those tariffs on and off and adjusted rates suddenly to squeeze or ease the pressure during negotiations.
    


            The small businesses suing the administration say the moves are driving costs – and uncertainty – to intolerable levels.
    


            While the president has described the case as an existential one for the country, he has avoided criticizing the companies involved in the litigation directly. Small businesses generally enjoy bipartisan political support and so having lesser-known companies lead the legal charge on tariffs may prove to be a strategic advantage.
    


            Several plaintiffs interviewed by CNN were careful to frame the case as far away from national politics as possible.
    


            “It's an asphyxiating tax,” said Rick Woldenberg, the CEO of Learning Resources, which makes educational toys and other products and which is also a lead plaintiff.
    


            “I'm not targeting Mr. Trump because I'm not a politician,” he said. “I'm a taxpayer who's been hit with an unlawful tax.”
    


            The Trump administration has argued the law's words clearly encompass tariffs, even if the word “tariff” is not explicitly included. And it has warned that a loss would have “catastrophic consequences” for the economy.
    


            “Plaintiffs would unwind trade arrangements worth trillions of dollars, as President Trump has leveraged the IEEPA tariffs into negotiated framework deals with major trading partners – including the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, and now China – that address underlying causes of the declared emergencies,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the administration's top appellate lawyer, told the Supreme Court in written arguments last week.
    


            Even when they are not named plaintiffs, major companies often wade into Supreme Court cases with friend-of-court briefs, offering their own take on the controversy pending before the justices.
    


            Three years ago, more than 60 major American firms – including General Electric, Procter & Gamble and Intel – signed a brief urging the justices not to end affirmative action in college admissions, for instance.
    


            Months later, the court ignored their advice. Today, some of the same companies that signed that brief are facing criticism in the second Trump administration for efforts to expand diversity within their workforces.
    


            In 2019, Apple CEO Tim Cook personally signed an amicus brief at the high court supporting the continuation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program created during the Obama administration for Dreamers. Home Depot signed a brief in 2021 in a case on damages suits. Walmart jumped into an appeal in 2017 dealing with the credit card industry.
    


            But the big difference today is the administration's willingness to pursue retribution against critics. Large companies, including many that have been affected by the tariffs, also avoided weighing in on the cases as they moved through lower federal courts.
    


            “The federal government has immense leverage and immense power and can upend your business with a tweet or a tax investigation,” said Gregory Shaffer, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “I think there's a sense that companies wanted to be more careful with this administration.”
    


            Friend-of-the-court briefs rarely have sway over the outcome of a case at the Supreme Court, but they can sometimes influence justices in unexpected ways. Last week, an amicus brief from a Georgetown law professor led the court to pause a case involving Trump's use of the National Guard in Illinois and request additional information from both the administration and state officials.
    


            Cassie Abel, founder and CEO of a women's outdoor apparel company called Wild Rye, agreed that fear of retaliation was probably part of the reason that larger companies haven't engaged in the tariffs appeal.
    


            Abel, who launched her company in Idaho nearly a decade ago, noted that Walmart and other retailers endured public blowback from Trump this year when they threatened tariff-related price increases.
    


            “That was a clear signal that anyone who wants to speak out against this is going to be in the pain cave,” said Abel, who joined an amicus brief with other small businesses opposed to the tariffs.
    


            But larger companies, Abel said, also may not be as immediately affected by tariffs as small ones. Some can switch supply chains or absorb the costs. And, Abel said, some of her largest competitors have pushed back on tariffs – just in quieter ways that don't involve taking a public position in a high-profile case.
    


            Some, meanwhile, have managed to secure exemptions to mitigate the impact of the tariffs.
    


            Several major companies that have submitted briefs in high-profile cases at the Supreme Court in the past – including Apple, Levi Strauss, Walmart and Home Depot – did not respond to requests for comment.
    


            The briefs that have made their way to the Supreme Court overwhelmingly oppose Trump's emergency tariffs.
    


            Former national security officials, a group representing the watchmaking industry, nearly three dozen former federal judges, a Virginia-based seller of audio equipment and many other small businesses told the justices they're opposed to the import taxes. The Chamber of Commerce also filed a brief in favor of unwinding Trump's tariffs.
    


            It's also not clear who is funding the litigation. Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at Liberty Justice Center, a group involved in the case, told CNN that it is funded by “individuals and groups that support our mission” but said it doesn't disclose its donors without their permission.
    


            “There are a lot of calculations going on,” said Gregory Husisian, a trade lawyer who represents large importers for the Foley & Lardner law firm. Large companies, he said, have to think about what legal argument they can raise “that's not already before the court.”
    


            Without that, he said, “what do you really gain by being the person who sticks your neck out?”

Kimberly-Clark is buying Tylenol maker Kenvue in a cash and stock deal worth about $48.7 billion, creating a massive consumer health goods company.

Shareholders of Kimberly-Clark will own about 54% of the combined company. Kenvue shareholders will own a

bout 46% in what is one of the largest corporate takeovers this year. 

The combined company will have a huge stable of household brands under one roof, putting Kenvue's Listerine mouthwash and Band-Aid side-by-side with Kimberly-Clark's Cottonelle toilet paper, Huggies and Kleenex tissues. It will also generate about $32 billion in annual revenue. 




Kenvue has spent a relatively brief period as an independent company, having been spun off by Johnson & Johnson two years ago. J&J first announced in late 2021 that it was splitting its slow-growth consumer health division from the pharmaceutical and medical device divisions. 

Kenvue has since been targeted by activist investors unhappy about the trajectory of the company and Wall Street appeared to anticipate some heavy lifting ahead for Kimberly-Clark. 

Shares of Kimberly-Clark, based in just outside of Dallas, slumped 13% Monday. Kenvue's stock jumped more than 15%. 

Kenvue and Tylenol have been thrust into the national spotlight this year as President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoted unproven and in some cases discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and the complex brain disorder autism.







Trump then urged pregnant women against using the medicine. That went beyond Food and Drug Administration advice that doctors “should consider minimizing” the painkiller acetaminophen's use in pregnancy — amid inconclusive evidence about whether too much could be linked to autism. 

Kennedy reiterated the FDA guidance during a press conference last week. He said that there isn't sufficient evidence to link the drug to autism. 

“We have asked physicians to minimize the use to when its absolutely necessary,” he said.

Kenvue has continued to push back on the Trump administration's dialogue.

“Nothing is more important to us than the health and safety of the people who use our products,” Kenvue said in a statement on its website. “We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with allegations that it does and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents.”

In July Kenvue, announced that CEO Thibaut Mongon was leaving in the midst of a strategic review with the company under mounting pressure from activist investors. 

Kimberly-Clark Chairman and CEO Mike Hsu will be chairman and CEO of the combined company. Three members of the Kenvue's board will join Kimberly-Clark's board at closing. The combined company will keep Kimberly-Clark's headquarters in Irving, Texas, but there will be significant operations around Kenvue facilities and locations as well. 

The deal is expected to close in the second half of next year. It still needs approval from shareholders of both both companies.

Kenvue shareholders will receive $3.50 per share in cash and 0.14625 Kimberly-Clark shares for each Kenvue share held at closing. That amounts to $21.01 per share, based on the closing price of Kimberly-Clark shares on Friday.

Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue said that they identified about $1.9 billion in cost savings that are expected in the first three years after the transaction's closing.

KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — In the Ugandan newsroom where he appeared one day as an intern, Zohran Mamdani looked shy and unassuming. His father had arranged for him to spend time at the Daily Monitor newspaper with hope that the teenager would show more interest in current affairs.

“He told me himself: He had to go every evening and have a conversation with his dad about the current affairs of the day,” recalled Angelo Izama, the journalist who was tasked with mentoring Mamdani in 2007 in the capital of his native Uganda, Kampala.

Mamdani wanted to be a “top reporter,” which is how Izama recalled saving the young man's number in his cellphone. While sports was the teen's passion, he also “had insatiable curiosity about the world” around him.

“He was very, very curious as a young person,” said Izama, who remained in touch with Mamdani for years after his months-long experience as a journalist. “This is something that will stay with him forever.”

Now the 34-year-old Mamdani, who has kept his Ugandan citizenship, could become New York City's first Muslim mayor and the first of Indian descent. Tuesday is the final day of voting as he faces Republican Curtis Sliwa and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent.

Izama told The Associated Press he was not surprised by Mamdani's rise in U.S. politics and described him as a role model not just for fellow Ugandans and other Africans but young people everywhere.




“I think he's basically global, not so much Ugandan and not so much American,” Izama said.

Mamdani was born in Kampala in 1991. His father is Mahmood Mamdani, a Columbia professor who taught for many years at Uganda's top public college, Makerere University, and whose academic writings are influential in the field of postcolonial studies. His mother is filmmaker Mira Nair, whose work has been nominated for an Academy Award. He is an only child.

The Mamdanis split their time among the U.S., India and Uganda, where they have a hillside home in a wealthy area of Kampala. In July, the family gathered here to celebrate Zohran Mamdani's marriage, underscoring their Ugandan roots.

Some Ugandans who have known Mamdani over the years say that while he may not be fluent in the local Luganda dialect, he understands the language and is proud of his local background.

“We shouldn't just be proud of Mamdani,” said Joseph Beyanga, a media manager who is among those who mentored Mamdani at the Daily Monitor. “We should be very excited.”

Beyanga said he felt “challenged” by Mamdani's ambition, calling it a civic lesson for young Africans who feel alienated from politics as aging leaders are accused of overstaying their time in power. They include Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who has led the country since 1986.

Izama said Mamdani “brings a role-model charge that would electrify Africa, which is full of talent,” adding that “there is reason for us to be very proud.”

Mamdani left Uganda as a child but regularly returned. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2018. Before he became a New York assemblyman in 2021, the self-described democratic socialist was a community organizer in the New York borough of Queens, helping vulnerable homeowners facing eviction.

Mamdani's win over Cuomo in the Democratic mayoral primary sent a shockwave through the political world. His campaign has focused on lowering the cost of living, promising free city buses, free childcare, a rent freeze for people living in rent-stabilized apartments and government-run grocery stores, all paid for with taxes on the wealthy.

His candidacy has attracted the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who alleged without evidence that Mamdani was in the U.S. “illegally.” Some Republicans have called for Mamdani's denaturalization and deportation.

Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama has reportedly offered to be a sounding board for Mamdani, and endorsements have come in from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.

Yet Mamdani's rocketing success would not be easily replicated in Uganda, said Nicholas Sengoba, an independent political analyst in Kampala.

His rise shows “that America is a land of opportunity for the free and the brave,” he said. “The irony is that in Uganda you would have to put in a big fight for it. You would have to blast your way into the door.”

LONDON (AP) — U.K. police on Monday charged a 32-year-old man with attempted murder over a mass stabbing attack on a train that wounded 11 people, and revealed that he may have stabbed two other people in the 24 hours before the attack.

British Transport Police said Anthony Williams is charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one of actual bodily harm and one of possession of a bladed article over the attack on Saturday.

He is also charged with attempted murder over an earlier incident at Pontoon Dock light rail station in London just before 1 a.m. on Saturday, in which a victim “suffered facial injuries after being attacked with a knife” by an assailant who fled the scene.

Another police force, Cambridgeshire Constabulary, said it is investigating whether Williams was involved in three incidents in the city of Peterborough — a Friday evening stabbing in which a 14-year-old boy received minor injuries and two reports of a man with a knife at a barber shop on Friday evening and Saturday morning. In all three cases, the suspect quickly left the scene and police did not detain anyone.

Police say they are not treating the train stabbings as an act of terror and are not looking for other suspects. A second man initially arrested as a suspect was released without charge on Sunday.

Williams, a British citizen living in Peterborough, made a brief appearance at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on Monday. 




Flanked by four security officers as he stood in the dock wearing a gray prison tracksuit and handcuffs, was ordered detained until his next hearing on Dec. 1. He was not asked to enter pleas.

The charge of actual bodily harm is for allegedly hitting a police officer and breaking his nose after Williams' arrest.

The minutes-long stabbing attack spree spread fear and panic through a train bound from Doncaster in northern England to London on Saturday evening. The train was about halfway through its journey and had just departed from a stop at Peterborough when police began receiving calls about people being stabbed onboard.

Passengers described scenes of panic as bloodied travelers raced down the train to get away from the knifeman. Stephen Crean, 61, told the BBC he was slashed across the hand and head as he tussled with the attacker, who asked him, “Do you want to die?”

Eleven people were treated in hospital. The most seriously wounded victim is a member of train staff who tried to stop the attacker and suffered “grievous injuries,” Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said. He is hospitalized in critical but stable condition.

“On Saturday he went to work to do his job. Today he is a hero and forever will be,” Mahmood told lawmakers in the House of Commons.

Four other victims remained in a hospital on Monday, including Jonathan Gjoshe, a player with soccer team Scunthorpe United. The team said he has “non-life threatening injuries.”

Williams was arrested when the train made an emergency stop in the town of Huntingdon, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) north of London. Police say he was detained within eight minutes of officers receiving the first emergency calls.

Authorities said the attack was an isolated incident but stepped up security on the railway, with armed police officers on patrol Monday at major train stations.

The government rejected calls for increased security measures such as airport-style passenger and baggage screening to be introduced at Britain's 3,500 railway stations, saying that wouldn't be “proportionate or practical.”

In the U.K, which has strict gun-control laws, almost half of all homicides involve a knife or sharp instrument. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's center-left government has pledged to reduce knife crime and has tightened rules for purchasing knives and banned some kinds of blades.

It claims to have had some success, with the total number of knife crimes down 5% and knife killings falling 18% in the year to June 2025 from the previous 12 months, according to the Office for National Statistics.

DODOMA, Tanzania (AP) — Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan on Monday blamed foreigners for last week's deadly protests following a disputed election in which two main opposition candidates were barred from challenging her bid for another term.

A regional African bloc, meanwhile, said the Oct. 29 election had fallen short of its standards for democratic elections. 

In her first comments after she was sworn in, Hassan acknowledged the “loss of lives” and asserted that “it was not a surprise that those arrested were from other countries,” without giving details. She vowed to unite the country and urged security agencies to ensure that normalcy returns.

Her swearing-in was held on government-owned grounds in the administrative capital of Dodoma, a departure from her previous inauguration at a packed football stadium, as tensions remained high.

It was not clear how many people were killed in the violence around the Oct. 29 election as demonstrators took to the streets of major cities to demand that vote-counting be stopped. The military was deployed to help police quell riots. Internet connectivity has been on and off in the East African nation, disrupting travel and other activities.

Gas stations and grocery shops were still closed Monday in the commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, with streets nearly empty. In Dodoma, most people stayed home. The government has postponed the reopening of universities, which had been set for Nov. 3.




A spokesman for the U.N. human rights office, Seif Magango, on Friday said there were credible reports of 10 deaths in Dar es Salaam and Shinyanga and Morogoro towns.

The secretary general of the Tanzania Episcopal Conference, Charles Kitima, asserted to The Associated Press that “hundreds” of people died, citing reports from communities.

“The president has been sworn in and we hope justice will be served to those who lost their loved ones and that protesters are not targeted,” the Catholic leader said, noting that Tanzania's young people are the most aggrieved.

Observers from a regional bloc Southern African Development Community said in a statement Monday that the Oct. 29 election had fallen short of the bloc's principles and guidelines for democratic elections, citing the barring of opposition candidates. 

The bloc also cited delays in accrediting election observers.

The country's main opposition party, Chadema, has rejected the election results, saying in a statement that they “have no basis in reality.”

Chadema party leader Tundu Lissu has been imprisoned for several months after being charged with treason for calling for electoral reforms that he said were necessary for a free and fair vote. Another opposition figure, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo Party, was barred from running.

Internet connections that were shut down in Tanzania on election day resumed Monday, but internet advocacy group Netblocks said there still “widespread restrictions” to many social media and messaging platforms. 

Tanzania's government urged public servants to return to work and everyone else to resume their economic activities on Tuesday.

The presidents of Mozambique, Zambia, Burundi and Somalia attended Monday's swearing-in. Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema urged Tanzanians to shun violence.

Kenyan President William Ruto in a statement on Monday called for dialogue in Tanzania to maintain stability. The election violence led to a closure of the main border crossing with Kenya at Namanga, where agricultural goods in trucks have been rotting for days.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel handed over the bodies of 45 Palestinians on Monday, the Red Cross said, a day after militants returned the remains of three hostages. Israeli officials identified the three as soldiers who were killed in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that triggered the war in Gaza. 

The exchange marked another step forward for the tenuous, U.S.-brokered ceasefire intended to end the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas. 

Since the truce took effect on Oct. 10, Palestinian militants have released the remains of 20 hostages, with eight now remaining in Gaza.

For each hostage returned, Israel has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians. With Monday's return, the bodies of 270 Palestinians have been handed back since the start of the ceasefire.

The Red Cross said it had facilitated the transfer of 45 Palestinian bodies to Gaza on Monday morning. Zaher al-Wahidi, a spokesperson at the Gaza Health Ministry, told The Associated Press that Nasser Hospital received the bodies around noon.

Only 78 of the bodies returned so far have been identified, the ministry said. Forensic work is complicated by a lack of DNA testing kits in Gaza, it added. The ministry posts photos of the remains online, in the hope that families will recognize them.

Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ‘s office identified the three hostages, whose bodies were returned to Israel on Sunday night, as Capt. Omer Neutra, an American-Israeli, Staff Sgt. Oz Daniel and Col. Assaf Hamami. A Hamas statement earlier said their remains were found on Sunday in a tunnel in southern Gaza.




Neutra was 21 when Hamas militants abducted his tank crew during the 2023 attack. In December 2024, the military announced Neutra had been killed in the attack. 

Daniel, 19, was part of the tank crew and was taken into Gaza. Nimrod Cohen, who was also in the tank, was released alive earlier, as was the body of one of the other crew members.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday he had spoken with Neutra's family. “They were thrilled, in one sense, but in another sense, obviously, it's not too great,” Trump said.

Hamami, commander of Israel's southern brigade in the Gaza division, was killed during the 2023 attack while fighting to defend Kibbutz Nirim and his body was taken into the Palestinian territory.

Militants have released one to three bodies every few days. Israel has pushed to speed up the returns and in certain cases has said the remains were not those of hostages. Hamas has said the work is complicated by widespread devastation.




A political scandal continued to rock Israel involving the military's former legal chief, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, who admitted to leaking a video of Israeli soldiers sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee and resigned from office. 

Far-right politician Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's national security minister, said Tomer-Yerushalmi was arrested Sunday night. At a court hearing Monday, the judge extended her detention by 48 hours until Wednesday, according to a copy of the decision. It said she is being held on suspicion of offenses including fraud, breach of trust and obstruction of justice. The investigation continues while she is held in a women's prison in central Israel.

Police conducted a frantic search for Tomer-Yerushalmi on Sunday after her family raised concerns about her safety and police found her abandoned car near the beach in Tel Aviv, Israel's Channel 12 reported. Police said she was found soon after the search began.

Israeli media reported that former chief military prosecutor Col. Matan Solomesh was also arrested overnight and his detention was also extended.

The Palestinian detainee who was the subject of sexual abuse in the video leaked by Tomer-Yerushalmi last year was released and returned to Gaza on Oct. 13, according to documentation from the military prosecutor's office obtained by the AP. 

Two Palestinians, one of them a teenager, were killed by Israeli gunfire Sunday night in separate incidents in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah.

Jamil Hanani, 17, was killed in the town of Beit Furik, the ministry said Monday. Israel's military said soldiers opened fire at Palestinians hurling rocks, hitting one person. Hanani's death extends a surge in military killings of Palestinian youth in the West Bank during an upswing in violence since the start of the war.

Also Sunday, Ahmed Al-Atrash, 32, was fatally shot by an Israeli settler at an entrance to the city of Hebron, the ministry said. Israel's military referred the AP to the police, who did not immediately comment. Hundreds of hard-line settlers live in fortified enclaves under military protection in the city of more than 200,000 Palestinians.

U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper will be in Jordan on Monday, with plans to visit a warehouse where British aid remains stuck waiting to enter Gaza.

Ahead of the visit, Cooper said that “humanitarian support is desperately needed and the people of Gaza cannot afford to wait.”

“Following the U.S.-led peace process and the plans for a substantial increase in aid for Gaza, we need an increase in crossings, an acceleration in lifting of restrictions and more agencies able to go in with aid,” Cooper said.

Cooper also announced that Britain will provide an extra 6 million pounds ($7.9 million) of humanitarian support for Gaza, provided by the U.N. Population Fund.

Also Monday, Gaza's Health Ministry announced that a campaign to vaccinate some 40,000 Palestinian children under 3 years old against preventable diseases like measles, polio and meningitis will kick off next week. It will focus on children who missed routine vaccinations or received only partial doses due to the war, Dr. Nedal Ghoneim, the Health Ministry's public health manager, told the AP.

The Hamas-led attack on southern Israel two years ago killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 68,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.

Israel, which has denied accusations by a U.N. commission of inquiry and others of committing genocide in Gaza, has disputed the ministry's figures without providing a contradicting toll.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the Food and Drug Administration's drug center abruptly resigned Sunday after federal officials began reviewing “serious concerns about his personal conduct,” according to a government spokesperson.

Dr. George Tidmarsh, who was named to the FDA post in July, was placed on leave Friday after officials in the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of General Counsel were notified of the issues, HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard said in an email. Tidmarsh then resigned Sunday morning.

“Secretary Kennedy expects the highest ethical standards from all individuals serving under his leadership and remains committed to full transparency,” Hilliard said.

The departure came the same day that a drugmaker connected to one of Tidmarsh's former business associates filed a lawsuit alleging that he made “false and defamatory statements,” during his time at the FDA.

The lawsuit, brought by Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, alleges that Tidmarsh used his FDA position to pursue a “longstanding personal vendetta” against the chair of the company's board of directors, Kevin Tang.

Tang previously served as a board member of several drugmakers where Tidmarsh was an executive, including La Jolla Pharmaceutical, and was involved in his ouster from those leadership positions, according to the lawsuit.

Messages placed to Tidmarsh and his lawyer were not immediately returned late Sunday.




Tidmarsh founded and led a series of pharmaceutical companies over several decades working in California's pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Before joining the FDA, he also served as an adjunct professor at Stanford University. He was recruited to join the agency over the summer after meeting with FDA Commissioner Marty Makary.

Tidmarsh's ouster is the latest in a string of haphazard leadership changes at the agency, which has been rocked for months by firings, departures and controversial decisions on vaccines, fluoride and other products.

Dr. Vinay Prasad, who oversees FDA's vaccine and biologics center, resigned in July after coming under fire from conservative activists close to President Donald Trump, only to rejoin the agency two weeks later at the behest of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

The FDA's drug center, which Tidmarsh oversaw, has lost more than 1,000 staffers over the past year to layoffs or resignations, according to agency figures. The center is the largest division of the FDA and is responsible for the review, safety and quality control of prescription and over-the-counter medicines.

In September, Tidmarsh drew public attention for a highly unusual post on LinkedIn stating that one of Aurinia Pharmaceutical's products, a kidney drug, had “not been shown to provide a direct clinical benefit for patients.” It's very unusual for an FDA regulator to single out individual companies and products in public comments online.

According to the company's lawsuit, Aurinia's stock dropped 20% shortly after the post, wiping out more than $350 million in shareholder value.

Tidmarsh later deleted the LinkedIn post and said he had posted it in his personal capacity, not as an FDA official.

Aurinia's lawsuit also alleges, among other things, that Tidmarsh used his post at FDA to target a type of thyroid drug made by another company, American Laboratories, where Tang also serves as board chair.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court of Maryland, seeks compensatory and punitive damages and “to set the record straight,” according to the company.

Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, weighs in on the government shutdown on 'Sunday Night in America.'

The Senate returns to Washington, D.C., this week as the government shutdown nears a record-shattering milestone and as lawmakers remain entrenched in their positions.

Come late Tuesday night, the government shutdown will officially become the longest on record, at 36 days, smashing through the previous record etched into the history books in early 2019. And while that record approaches, and payday deadlines are missed and federal benefits dry up, the Senate is still largely in a holding pattern.

Still, there was newfound optimism among some lawmakers as bipartisan talks increased last week, and many hope that same momentum carries into this week.

TRUMP'S 'NUCLEAR' DEMAND NOT LANDING FOR SENATE REPUBLICANS AMID SHUTDOWN

But for now, neither side is budging from the positions they've maintained since Oct. 1, when the shutdown officially began.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and his Democratic caucus want a deal on expiring Obamacare premium subsidies before they agree to reopen the government. Saturday was when open enrollment officially began nationwide.

They've long warned that unless a deal was made before open enrollment, Americans that rely on the subsidies would see their premiums spike, despite the subsidies not expiring until the end of this year.

""People are going to see drastic, drastic increases in their healthcare costs,"" Schumer said last week. ""People are going to sit at the dinner table Friday night with a pit, with a hole in the pit of their stomach, and say, ‘How are we going to do this?'""

Senate Republicans largely agree that there needs to be an extension of some kind to the subsidies, but they also want a host of reforms made to the program that was enhanced under former President Joe Biden.

And Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has offered Senate Democrats a vote on the Obamacare subsidies, but they say that's not enough and demand that President Donald Trump get involved.

Trump officially returned to the country after a near weeklong trip to Asia but still appears to be keeping the shutdown at an arm's length.

While Schumer and his Democratic caucus' demands have remained laser-focused on expiring Obamacare subsidies, they have also blamed Trump for not funding federal food benefits as he did in 2019, and Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., have called for a meeting with the president.

But Trump won't meet with the top congressional Democrats until the shutdown ends — a point he and Republicans have made time and time again.

And he won't budge on healthcare negotiations until the government reopens, either.

""I'm not going to do it by being extorted by the Democrats who have lost their way,"" Trump said on CBS' ""60 Minutes."" ""There's something wrong with these people.""

Meanwhile, Trump has urged Senate Republicans to get rid of the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the upper chamber. Doing so is a proverbial third rail for Senate Republicans and a longstanding priority for Senate Democrats.

He renewed that call over the weekend in posts on Saturday and Sunday to his social media platform Truth Social.

""Republicans, you will rue the day that you didn't TERMINATE THE FILIBUSTER!!! BE TOUGH, BE SMART, AND WIN,"" he said.

Retired FBI special agent Jason Pack breaks down three key issues investigators will be looking at regarding the explosion at Harvard University's medical school on 'Fox Report.'

Two suspects in the weekend explosion at Harvard Medical School in Boston remain on the run Monday as police declared it safe for students and faculty to return to campus.

The explosion happened just after 2:45 a.m. Saturday in the Goldenson Building. Two masked suspects were seen fleeing from the building after the blast went off in a small section of the fourth-floor hallway, Harvard officials said in an update on Sunday.

The section where the explosion happened has since been cleared and is fully operational, the university said. It added that the building did not sustain any structural damage and all labs and equipment remained intact.

Harvard University Police Department (HUPD) confirmed there was no continued public safety threat and said it was safe to return to campus, university officials said in the update.

The Boston Fire Department Arson Unit responded and made an initial assessment that the explosion appeared to be intentional, officials previously said, and they believe a single device to be involved.

The Boston Police Department conducted a sweep of the building to check for any additional devices, and none were found.

The university said HUPD will maintain an increased presence on the Longwood campus as the investigation remains active and ongoing.

""[Jen and Jim are] casually dating and having fun,"" an insider told People at the time. 

""They've been seeing each other for a few months now,"" another source told the outlet. ""They were introduced by a friend and started out as friends. Jen had read his book and was familiar with his work. She's really into self-help and wellness. They are dating, but it's still casual.""

""She's been happy on her own, but she's also open to sharing her life with someone. As long as it feels right,"" the source added. ""Jen's in a very good place right now — grounded, fulfilled and very happy.""

Curtis, a life coach who specializes in hypnotherapy, is ""very different from anyone she's dated before,"" the insider said. 

The ""Morning Show"" star was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005 and to Justin Theroux from 2015 to 2018.

According to Curtis' Instagram, the author's ""mission is to help you heal and thrive by upgrading your I AM.""

When Curtis was 22 years old, he found out he had lesions on his spinal cord, which led to years of chronic pain. He told Fast Company during an interview in 2018, ""It was unknown how they started, but I very rapidly became ill and soon had trouble walking."" 

He spoke to the outlet about hiding his illness from his co-workers while he worked on Wall Street, a job that Curtis said ""couldn't have been a worse choice"" with his condition. ""I had to stand up in a crowd all day. It was super high-stress, which is inflammatory and devastating for a condition like mine. It increased symptoms of fatigue and pain, and it brought on new ones like IBS [irritable bowel syndrome] and other things I couldn't control.""

Curtis remains open about the impact his health has had on his life. 

""My own illness and disability forced me to confront the limited beliefs, disconnection and trauma that was keeping me sad, sick and alone,"" he wrote on his website. ""My health journey has been my greatest teacher in developing a life of higher connection, purpose and love. Through many powerful tools including hypno-realization - I not only transformed my physical health, depression and relationships, I've helped thousands of others break free to create an entirely new reality full of connection, community and love.""

Energy Secretary Chris Wright joins 'The Sunday Briefing' to discuss the impact of the government shutdown on nuclear modernization, plans for testing, AI-driven energy demand and efforts to expand U.S. power generation capacity.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright revealed the U.S. will not be testing nuclear explosions, putting to rest questions over whether the Trump administration would reverse a decades-old taboo.

Testing will instead involve ""the other parts of a nuclear weapon,"" Wright told Fox News' ""The Sunday Briefing.""

""I think the tests we're talking about right now are systems tests,"" he explained. ""These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.""

His comments came after President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would reignite ""nuclear testing"" because other nations were doing so. The president made the announcement on the way to a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

WITH A NUCLEAR BACKDROP, TRUMP EASES TENSIONS WITH XI BUT MERELY RETURNS TO THE STATUS QUO

He didn't specify whether he meant explosives, which haven't been tested by the U.S. since 1992, or the weapons that carry them.

The only nation to conduct a detonation test in the last 25 years is North Korea in September 2017.

The president said he'd directed the Pentagon — which is responsible for testing nuclear-capable vehicles — to resume testing. The Energy Department would have jurisdiction over testing explosives.

TRUMP BREAKS 33-YEAR NUCLEAR TESTING SILENCE AS WORLD BRACES FOR DANGEROUS NEW ARMS RACE

""We've halted it years — many years — ago,"" Trump said last week. ""But with others doing testing, I think it is appropriate that we do also.""

Asked on Friday to clarify whether the U.S. would begin ""detonating nuclear weapons for testing,"" the president responded, ""I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do.""

Trump claimed in a CBS ""60 Minutes"" interview over the weekend that U.S. adversaries were secretly testing nuclear weapons.

""Russia's testing nuclear weapons, and China's testing them, too,"" he said. ""You just don't know about it.""

China is rapidly expanding its nuclear silo and is expected to have nearly 1,000 warheads by 2030, according to Pentagon assessments. But Beijing has not conducted a nuclear weapons test since 1996. Russia has not been confirmed to have tested a weapon since 1990, but last week did claim to test two delivery vehicles: an undersea torpedo known as Poseidon and a nuclear-powered cruise missile.

In 1996, the United Nations adopted a nuclear test ban treaty. The U.S. signed the treaty, but the Senate rejected its ratification. Most other nuclear-armed states also did not ratify the document.

Still, it created a global norm against nuclear weapons testing.

The U.S. regularly tests unarmed nuclear-capable weapons.

Additionally, non-explosive or ""subcritical"" tests, which involve fissile materials but stop short of producing a chain reaction, have been conducted at the Nevada National Security Site for years. Officials say these experiments help validate computer models that simulate how aging warheads behave, allowing scientists to verify performance without explosive testing.

The U.S. has conducted more than two dozen such tests since the late 1990s.

""And again, these will be nonnuclear explosions,"" Mr. Wright said. ""These are just developing sophisticated systems so that our replacement nuclear weapons are even better than the ones they were before.""

Washington is currently undergoing a three-decade, $1.7 trillion transformation effort to replace aging warheads with updated versions.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins joins ‘Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss efforts to restore SNAP benefits during the government shutdown and push for long-term reforms to the program.

As the Trump administration works to bring the nation's largest food aid program back online, attention is shifting to just how expansive the program has become and to the administration's push to ensure illegal immigrants aren't among its recipients.

Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), meant to be a lifeline for low-income households, was set to expire over the weekend as the government shutdown entered its second month.

CHARTS ILLUSTRATE THE SCALE OF SNAP AS MILLIONS FACE POTENTIAL BENEFIT LAPSE

The sweeping program, which supports more than 40 million Americans, was among the first priorities Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins targeted for review, citing concerns about eligibility and oversight.

""We sent letters to every governor in America being very clear that no illegal aliens can use SNAP, zero, zero, zero. We asked every state for the first time in history, this was in February, to send us their data,"" Rollins said during an interview on ""Fox & Friends Weekend."" 

She added that so far only 29 states have complied with the request, but Rollins said even that limited data has already revealed significant misuse.

""We have found thousands and thousands of illegal use of the EBT card, we have been moving people off of SNAP, we've got about 700,000 people that we've moved off SNAP since the president took office, and we've arrested about 118 people,"" Rollins said.

She added that investigators also discovered about 5,000 dead people who were still receiving benefits.

""It is time to drastically reform this program, so that we can make sure that those who are truly needy and truly vulnerable are getting what they need and the rest of the corruption goes away so that we can serve the American taxpayer,"" she added.

‘THAT ENDS NOW:' WHITE HOUSE VOWS REMOVAL OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM TAXPAYER BENEFITS

Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) says about 41.7 million Americans, or one in eight households, rely on SNAP benefits each month. 

The highest share of beneficiaries live in New Mexico, Washington, D.C. and Louisiana, followed by Oregon, according to USDA data.

Under former President Joe Biden, federal spending on SNAP reached record highs, $128 billion in 2021 and $127 billion in 2022, as pandemic-era aid expanded food assistance. Last year, SNAP cost $99.8 billion, with monthly benefits averaging $187 per participant, according to federal figures.

FOOD STAMP BENEFITS FOR 42 MILLION AMERICANS IN JEOPARDY AS SHUTDOWN DRAGS ON

Adults ages 18 to 59 made up the largest share of SNAP recipients at 42%, according to USDA data. Many participants also relied on other government assistance, with 61% receiving income from programs such as Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or state aid.

With millions of Americans depending on SNAP for food assistance, the program has become a focal point in the legal and political battles over government spending during the shutdown. A pair of federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled Friday that the Trump administration must use emergency funds to finance the program.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday that SNAP funding could come back online as early as Wednesday.

""There's a process that has to be followed. So, we've got to figure out what the process is,"" Bessent said in an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""President Trump wants to make sure that people get their food benefits.""

“You can rest assured that I will be telling our congregation to vote for you,” Second Calvary Baptist Church head pastor Geoffrey Guns told Democratic Virginia attorney general nominee Jay Jones in a video shot on Wednesday.

Guns's full-throated support for Jones, alongside his endorsement of Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger, followed nearly $30,000 in “sponsorship” payments from the campaign account of state Sen. Louise Lucas, the top Democrat in Virginia's upper chamber and the public face of the movement to gerrymander Virginia. Lucas's power in Virginia would be greatly expanded if a Republican were not in the governor's mansion, standing athwart her legislative agenda.

Beyond telling his congregation to vote for Jones, Guns's church also hosted a campaign event for Spanberger as part of her pre-Election Day bus tour on Oct. 26 and filmed a video with Democratic lieutenant gubernatorial nominee Ghazala Hashmi, endorsing her candidacy.

“When I heard you talk about [funding historically black colleges and universities] that really resonated with me and I said ‘this is the person I need to support for lieutenant governor,” Guns, who is black and leads a predominantly black congregation, told Hashmi in a video posted on Oct. 14. “I want you to support her as well,” the pastor told his congregation.

Guns has said he “proudly” endorses Spanberger for governor, shared a Democratic voter guide with his congregation, invited Spanberger to campaign from his church's pulpit, and encouraged his congregants at length to vote for Democrats during a recent sermon.

“Voting is not merely political duty, it is prophetic stewardship,” Guns said during his Oct. 26 sermon. “We must vote and we must go to the polls and we must turn out in big numbers and you must tell your sons and your daughters there's only one choice for governor … Abigail!”

Guns yelled “there's one choice” at multiple points during the sermon, referring to his support for Spanberger.

Lucas's campaign paid Second Calvary Baptist Church $14,000 in 2023 for a “diamond sponsorship,” a further $5,000 that year for a “platinum sponsorship,” and $7,500 in 2024 for further sponsorship. Guns's church also received a $500 donation from Democratic state Sen. Angelia Williams Graves in 2023 after he endorsed her.

Americans generally oppose houses of worship endorsing political candidates, with 77% of adults polled by the Pew Research Center in 2022 saying churches should not favor one candidate over another in elections.

This is not the first time Second Calvary Baptist Church has melded politics and religion.

In 2021, the left-of-center Freedom From Religion Foundation wrote to the IRS to complain that the church violated nonprofit organization guidelines by allowing activist Stacey Abrams to give speeches urging them to vote for McAuliffe, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate that year. The organization's letter cited IRS regulations that prevent churches from participating in or intervening in “any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office,” lest they lose their nonprofit organization status.

FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS, AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DONATED TO JAY JONES AFTER TEXT SCANDAL

Under President Donald Trump, however, the IRS has said it will allow churches to endorse political candidates without jeopardizing their nonprofit organization status.

Some conservatives have attacked New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani as a “radical Islamist.”

“He refused to say Hamas should disarm,” noted one writer at the Federalist. “He won't condemn the extremist phrase ‘Globalize the Intifada.' He seeks associations with Brooklyn imams who encourage jihad.”

On the other hand, he has also been critiqued as a hard-left sexual revolutionary, posting about “Queer liberation,” placing pro-transgender ads, and calling for taxpayer-funded surgeries to make transgender people look like the opposite sex.

‘QUEER LIBERATION': DID ANYONE 2020 HARDER THAN MAMDANI?

There's a clash between these critiques: Is Mamdani going to impose Sharia law, or is he radically pro-gay and pro-transgender?

Many of his supporters have pointed out this contradiction.

You guys this is getting scary. The evidence is in: Not only is Mamdani going to force all New Yorkers to become Muslims, he's going to force all New Yorkers to become gay Muslims. https://t.co/rFTXVj4lvg

At some point people like you are going to have to decide on one caricature or the other: whether Zohran is some far-left Communist pro-trans radical, or whether he wants to impose sharia law on everyone and throw gay people off of roofs.

It's a fair critique by Mamdani's critics. And the answer is explained, indirectly, by this excellent essay by Zineb Riboua. In short, you can understand Islam not as a religion so much as a marker of oppression. And in the post-colonial ideology that Riboua describes, that means everything.

Here's a key passage:

“The issues evolve, but the lens persists, as it's fundamentally a moral binary logic that divides the powerful from the powerless.”

“Mamdani's speeches evoke that same architecture of thought. His convictions echo the Algerian Revolution's core belief that the oppressed occupy history's moral vanguard and that their liberation redeems human dignity. In the United States, a nation without colonies, he adapts this anti-imperial ethos to a society steeped in guilt and redemption narratives. Mamdani repurposes the lexicon of Third-World liberation for American soil, transforming decolonization into a scaffold for moral and political identity.”

Riboua directly addresses Islam at one point in her discussion of Mamdani's post-colonial ideology:

“It transcends socialism, unmoored from class or ownership, and eludes Islamism, unbound by theocratic aims. Here, Islam serves as an emblem of subjugation with universal resonance, a faith recast as resistance and moral cohesion against Western dominance.”

MAMDANI MOBILIZES VOLUNTEER ARMY TO BREAK DOOR-KNOCKING RECORD IN EARLY VOTING FINALE

She doesn't explicitly address gay or transgender matters, and she doesn't use the word “intersectionality,” but you can see how that idea — that all oppression is one oppression, and thus all oppressed classes are one — is half a step from this American version of post-colonialism.

I don't know Mamdani's personal beliefs and faith, except that he obviously doesn't believe in Sharia law. But I think you'll better understand him if you assume that he wears Islam and embraces Muslims not as a deeply held religious belief, but as an emblem of oppression and a source of resistance against the powerful.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn hosted a phone bank for New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani on Sunday, drawing scrutiny from the Justice Department for potential foreign election interference.

Corbyn is a current member of the U.K. Parliament, and his work supporting the Mamdani campaign could be considered illegal.

“I'm hosting a phone bank with @nycDSA to Get Out The Vote for @ZohranKMamdani today at 6pm ET. Let's get Zohran over the finish line for a New York that's affordable for all!” he posted on X. The three-hour event is hosted by the Democratic Socialists of America but paid for by Zohran for NYC.

Phone-banking is a common campaign tactic where surrogates call voters to ask for their vote.

It's unclear if Corbyn is calling voters himself or instructing volunteers on how to make calls. Corbyn is pictured on the phone-banking virtual call, according to the Forward.

Under U.S. law, it is illegal for a foreign national to indirectly or directly make “a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value, or to make an express or implied promise to make a contribution or donation, in connection with a Federal, State, or local election.”

Corbyn appeared to have provided a service to DSA in an event paid for by the Mamdani campaign.

“Foreign interference in a US election?” Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon speculated on X.

“I'm sure the John Brennan posse will get right on this with an indignant letter,” Dhillon said in a follow-up post, referencing the former CIA director's Russian interference claim.

Stu Smith, an investigative analyst for Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank, says Corbyn's actions could be legal as long as he isn't compensated.

“It's technically legal under FEC rules as long as Corbyn isn't compensated. Still, it's a perfect example of how DSA, technically a 501(c)(4), keeps blurring lines with its ongoing collaborations and cross border ties to foreign parties. Makes you wonder how closely they're tiptoeing around FARA,” he posted on X.

Corbyn's DSA appearance in support of Mamdani also drew criticism because of his alleged past antisemitism. An Equality and Human Rights Commission report in 2020 said the Labour Party was responsible for “unlawful” harassment and discrimination during Corbyn's time as leader.

Corbyn was suspended from the party after calling the report's findings “exaggerated.”

CUOMO CLOSES GAP WITH MAMDANI, ALMOST MARGIN-OF-ERROR RACE: POLL

Mamdani's campaign is scrambling to garner any last-second support in the New York City mayoral race, utilizing its DSA ties to get voters to the polls.

An Arizona school is embroiled in controversy after a photo of a group of teachers wearing bloody T-shirts went viral on social media over the weekend.

The photo featured teachers from the math department of Cienega High School in Vail, Arizona, wearing white T-shirts half covered in fake blood with the phrase “Problem Solved” printed on the front. Many accused the teachers of using the costume to mock the assassination of activist and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk.    

Andrew Kolvet, a spokesman for Turning Point USA and executive producer of “The Charlie Kirk Show,” posted about the photo on his X account on Nov. 1, saying the educators deserved to be “famous and fired.”

Concerned parents just sent us this image of what's believed to be teachers in @vailschools in Tuscon, Arizona mocking Charlie's murder with costumes that read ""Problem Solved"" and blood down the left side of their shirts.They deserve to be famous, and fired. pic.twitter.com/bs95p2lkU0

“Concerned parents just sent us this image of what's believed to be teachers in @vailschools in Tuscon, Arizona mocking Charlie's murder with costumes that read ‘Problem Solved' and blood down the left side of their shirts,” read Kolvet's post. “They deserve to be famous, and fired.”

However, John Carruth, the school district superintendent, said the shirts were unrelated to anything about Kirk's death. The school district's superintendent said the shirts were “part of a math-themed Halloween costume meant to represent solving tough math problems” and that the shirts “were never intended to target any person, event, or political issue.”

“Unfortunately, the image is being shared online with false claims that they were intended as a statement of recent events in our country,” said Carruth in a statement released to parents in the district. “This is unequivocally untrue. The shirts were purchased online and were also worn last year as part of the same math-themed costumes, long before recent events. For anyone questioning the validity that the shirts were worn last year, I am happy to provide the photo to you.”

“We understand how this image could be misunderstood and taken out of context, especially by people who are not associated with the teachers or the school,” read the letter. “We are truly sorry for the hurt or upset it has caused.”

A search for the “Problem Solved” T-shirt revealed that it started being sold long before Kirk's assassination. An Amazon ad for the product revealed users providing reviews after purchasing it as early as 2024. There was also an Instagram post from a math teacher in October 2024 (seemingly not from the same school district) asking her followers what “math” Halloween costume she should wear, with one of the three options she posted being the “Problem Solved” shirt. 

Despite this, as of early Monday morning, Kolvet's post had 9.5 million views and over 32,000 likes on X. It was circulated by numerous social media influencers, including Benny Johnson, who called the post “sick and evil” and claimed that “they aren't even hiding it anymore.” Other posts appeared to doxx the teachers in the photo, providing the alleged names and phone numbers of those in the picture. 

Rep. Rachel Keshel, a Republican elected official from Arizona's 17th district in the state's House of Representatives, also reposted Kolvet, saying she was “deeply outraged by the recent reports of staff at Vail Unified School District donning costumes that seemingly mock the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk—complete with ‘Problem Solved' slogans and simulated blood stains on the same side that Charlie's fatal wound was on.

Conservative activist Riley Gaines promoted the picture as well in a post on X.

Don't you see? They view you as a problem and they want you DEAD. https://t.co/CFEmLHXBeh

“Don't you see? They view you as a problem and they want you DEAD,” Gaines said.

Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis quoted Kolvet's original post on his X account, stating, “It's been really disturbing to see teachers across the country glorifying a murder just because they disagreed with the victim.” Numerous other influencers, commentators, and politicians reposted the story about the Arizona teachers.

Here is the explanation from the school district re: the bloody shirts.  Some have cast doubt on this explanation but people can read it and decide for themselves. https://t.co/ZBZ2NJXLsr pic.twitter.com/HcOUdv9DG9

Kolvet posted Carruth's response and explanation later on Nov. 1. He also provided an update about the picture, which seemed to confirm the explanation of the costume. DeSantis also provided the update and explanation.

“Vail Schools said these math teachers wore the same costume last year,” Kolvet said. “I was waiting for confirmation, and it appears they did. I am updating the thread with the image. We've seen enough evil since Charlie's murder that I'd actually be relieved if this isn't another example.” 

SPANBERGER LEANS ON OBAMA AND DEMOCRATIC STAR POWER IN BATTLE AGAINST EARLE-SEARS

Incidentally, Carruth's reply, which was initially posted to the Vail school district's Facebook page, was later removed without explanation.

Some have claimed that the post is an example of the dangers of social media, where people do not accurately vet news stories. While Kolvet's original post had over 9.5 million views and 32,000 likes, the updated statement had fewer than 3 million views and over 7,000 likes. There have been reports of other educators mocking Kirk's death, including during the “No Kings” Protest last month. However, it does not appear that the teachers at Cienega High School are an example of that.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Azerbaijan, the ostensibly pro-Western and secular dictatorship in the Caucasus, likes to depict itself as a bastion of religious tolerance, a bulwark against Islamist terrorism, and an ally in the West's efforts to free itself from energy dependence on hostile powers.

Baku's cynicism toward its Jewish and Christian populations is well-established. It subsidizes, if not pays for, luxurious junkets, many of which visit the same Jewish villages or Christian leaders, all of whom attest to the regime's munificence. The Jewish villages are largely museums, and the minority interlocutors are well-practiced tour guides for the naive or corrupt.

Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijan's dynastic dictator, is equally deceptive in his opposition to jihadism. Following the 2023 ethnic cleansing of Nagorno-Karabakh, Aliyev arrested the region's democratically elected, ethnic Armenian leaders on false terrorism charges. Azerbaijan's Armenian hostages include philanthropist and former state minister Ruben Vardanyan and former foreign minister David Babayan, a 52-year-old academic and author of several books. Aliyev's show trials harken back to the Soviet era; outside his domestic audience, they have no resonance.

What is important, however, is Aliyev's attempt to draw moral equivalence between the Armenian intellectuals he holds and the terrorists and mercenaries to whom he draws equivalence and whom he demands Armenia release. Turkey recruited up to 2,000 Syrian jihadists, for example, to fight a religious war against Christians. The United Nations working group on the use of mercenaries also expressed concern about the recruitment of poor Syrians and their embrace by Azerbaijan. “We came here to cut the heads of [unbelievers] off,” one terrorist now in Armenian custody explained. Azerbaijan would pay a bonus for every severed head the Syrian mercenaries provided. That Aliyev would use Azerbaijan's diplomatic capital to demand the release of jihadis intent on beheading Christians shows more than any junket for think-tankers, diplomats, or influencers where his heart truly lies; it also contradicts Azerbaijan's narrative as a country that the West can trust to uphold security norms.

Azerbaijan also undermines U.S. sanctions on Russia. Less than a week before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russia's Lukoil purchased a nearly 10% stake in the Shah Deniz natural gas project from Malaysian oil and gas company Petronas, a deal that made Lukoil a partner of the Azerbaijani state-owned oil firm SOCAR. While Azerbaijan sells itself as a means to bypass Iranian and Russian gas, Baku's math does not add up, as the gas it produces is less than that it pipes to Europe, meaning it serves as a conduit to launder Iranian and Russian gas.

On Oct. 22, the U.S. Department of the Treasury slapped sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil subsidies to pressure Russia to accept a ceasefire with Ukraine. It exempted Lukoil's Azerbaijan operations, allowing Baku to continue to profit from Russia's oil and gas trade even as Aliyev sells himself as an alternative. The British government has not been so easily deceived; on May 9, 2025, London sanctioned an Azerbaijani tanker operating within Russia's “dark fleet” smuggling oil. SOCAR has purchased two other tankers, though, that continue the trade.

HEGSETH PLEDGES TO RESHAPE WAR DEPARTMENT AFTER ‘DECADES OF DECAY'

President Donald Trump is correct to fight Islamist terrorism and use sanctions to coerce Russian President Vladimir Putin toward peace, but when countries like Azerbaijan receive plaudits for saying the right thing but then do the opposite, they actively undercut regional security and make a mockery of Trump.

The White House and State Department must start calibrating policy to reality rather than rhetoric. Forcing Baku to stop supporting religious repression, jihadi terrorism, and sanctions busting would be a good place to start.

What two new books on the English Renaissance reveal about the appeal of speculative history

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

If you close your eyes and picture an artistic genius, chances are that the portrait will be framed by a Romantic ideal that took shape 200 years ago: an artist dedicated solely to his (almost always his) muse and transgressive appetites, breaking his era's rules both moral and artistic, remaking society with his art. But this vision of genius is a poor fit for many great artists, and it tends to obscure what makes them and their work special. Take William Shakespeare, who is often portrayed as a carouser, downing pints while exchanging barbs with his fellow writers, cheating on his wife with both men and women, passionately engaging his quill to reimagine the very nature of the human being.

The little we know of Shakespeare's life calls most of this into question. The man wrote two plays a year for much of his career, worked as an actor, and probably helped manage the theater company in which he was a major shareholder. His work was more conservative when it came to violence and sex than that of his peers. He did not invent any of the major components of his dramaturgy, and he almost always adapted existing source material. He invested wisely, worked hard to attain the rank of gentleman, and retired in his beloved hometown. If Shakespeare was, as Ben Jonson wrote, the “soul of the age,” that may be in part because his life was nearly as conventional as any actor's or writer's in his time.

Shakespeare was shaped as much by that time as he was a shaper of it, and despite being the English language's greatest writer, he defies the common vision of a genius at the cultural vanguard. Luckily, another brilliant Elizabethan playwright better suits the Romantic model: Christopher Marlowe.

As Stephen Greenblatt relates thrillingly in his new biography, Dark Renaissance, Marlowe led a brief and stormy life that deeply transformed the  theater. He likely pioneered both the soliloquy and iambic pentameter on the English stage. He was never regularly employed, and he was completely disinterested in business. His plays gleefully plumb the wickedest aspects of the human psyche, delivering tales of relentless conquest, Jewish perfidy, deals with the devil, and gay love. The most famous of these works, Doctor Faustus, is about the glories and perils of eccentric genius. Marlowe's life story is also filled with near escapes, nefarious friends, bizarre escapades. He was almost prosecuted for counterfeiting. Multiple people accused him of outspoken atheism, a transgression then punishable by death. He was probably gay, possibly a spy, often in trouble with the law, and even died in a fight over a bar tab—stabbed through the eye with a knife.

Greenblatt, a scholar and critic both highly acclaimed and somewhat controversial, is clearly drawn to Marlowe because he's such a deliciously Romantic figure. Greenblatt argues that Marlowe “awakened the genius of the English Renaissance,” and that this was possible only because his life on the edge provided the materials necessary for his plays. Dark Renaissance is beautifully written and frequently perceptive about Marlowe's work and times, but Greenblatt's investment in making myth over documenting history becomes more of a problem as the book progresses. His imaginative storytelling techniques, well known to readers of his previous books Will in the World and The Swerve, often threaten to push him into the realm of historical fiction. Dark Renaissance will teach you a great deal about Marlowe's brilliance and the Elizabethan era—its theater, the aristocracy, the spy craft, and the finer points of drawing and quartering religious dissidents. But much of what it has to say about Marlowe's life story is pure supposition.

Read: Shakespeare in love, or in context

At the beginning of his career, Greenblatt helped usher in the New Historicist movement in early modern scholarship, championing the idea that English departments should ditch both the postmodern treatment of the author as dead and New Criticism, with its fetish for close reading, and instead place works within their historical and social contexts. For example, if you know about the succession crisis that gripped the English court toward the end of Queen Elizabeth's life, Julius Caesar, Hamlet, and several other plays gain new resonance. New Historicism was a much-needed corrective—my own Shakespeare podcast, Lend Me Your Ears, could not have existed without it—but its limits often arise, ironically, regarding the very era that Greenblatt specializes in. We know so little for sure about the lives of the great poets of the 16th and early 17th centuries that we have no choice but to speculate. Shakespeare didn't keep a diary; when we say that Julius Caesar encodes English subjects' fears that their world was about to fall apart, we are making an imaginative leap.

Greenblatt's work for a popular audience takes that leap about as far as it can go. The contract his books implicitly serve the reader is that he will be wildly but openly speculative. He will track for us when he is making informed assumptions or imaginative re-creations, and present the evidence that supports his inventions. In exchange, we will get a more entertaining and adventuresome book. At best, all of his perhapses and could have beens will lead to unexpected, thought-provoking conclusions. But a slight of hand is at work; the maybes of one chapter become the assumptions of the next, and at times contrary evidence is entirely ignored.

Dark Renaissance's vision of Marlowe rests on the ideas that he was a heretic and a spy. The major evidence for the former is a letter written by one of Marlowe's enemies, along with a confession by the playwright Thomas Kyd that was made under torture. The lacunae in the record lead Greenblatt to sprinkle breadcrumbs of heretical thought through his tale. Early on, he speculates that, at Cambridge, Marlowe's friend John Greenwood “may have introduced” him to two other men who “were highly critical of the official religious settlement.” Before long, Dark Renaissance treats Marlowe as a confirmed and known unbeliever.

The question of Marlowe's spying is one of the great controversies in early modern English literature, and it also originates in his Cambridge years. Marlowe almost did not graduate because of unauthorized absences, and Queen Elizabeth's advisers on the Privy Council intervened on his behalf. The letter they wrote asked that Marlowe (they called him Morley) be allowed to graduate because he had done the Queen “good service.” We do not know for certain where he went during the absences or what the service was. Theories about this abound—all have their evidentiary shortcomings—but Greenblatt agrees with a common one that sees Marlowe traveling to France and uncovering Catholic conspiracies against the Crown.

Marlowe's supposed involvement in spying then becomes the skeleton key to his psyche. By the time the writer meets Shakespeare (a meeting that has never been confirmed), we are in the realm of pure fiction. “Marlowe,” Greenblatt writes, “was evidently skilled at drawing out what others intended to keep in the dark. That is, after all, a spy's skill. He might have hinted first at Catholic sympathies to see how Shakespeare would respond.” (Shakespeare, in Greenblatt's telling, demurs.)

Read: What Shakespeare got right about PTSD

The occasion for their meeting is a collaboration on the writing of Henry VI, which is presumed because the editors of The New Oxford Shakespeare edition of his plays determined, via computer analysis, that Marlowe co-wrote the play. Although the notion that Shakespeare collaborated with other writers in his early career is not controversial, the New Oxford's attribution model is. But for Dark Renaissance's project, these complexities seem less important than the need to tell a coherent, compelling story, one that comes to feel predetermined by the myth of the Romantic genius.

Myths are not bad in and of themselves, and the imagination is a necessary component of interpretation. One could easily say my earlier (also somewhat speculative) portrait of Shakespeare as a diligent pencil pusher is a myth meant to comfort me, now that my carousing days are over and I write book reviews from my basement, surrounded by snoring dogs. If we see Greenblatt's project as mythmaking, Dark Renaissance becomes something far more pleasurable and less troubling.

However, mythmaking exacts costs on our understanding of the past. Greenblatt's story requires a cartoonishly authoritarian and brutal England. It was both of those things, but its censorship regime also allowed Marlowe's transgressive plays to be performed, and its audiences loved his work despite living in a land “as backward in poetry as it was in painting, sculpture, and the life of the mind.” As Dark Renaissance goes on, its mythmaking also interferes with Greenblatt's greatest skill: the interpretation of the plays themselves. Instead of this, we have scholarship as tautology. The plays are interpreted through the lens of Marlowe's imagined life; these interpretations then bolster claims about his biography. Thus a wonderful section on The Jew of Malta climaxes in an unfortunate vision of the text as a secret message to Lord Strange, a wealthy and important patron of the arts. Like a literary George Smiley, Greenblatt sets to work decoding the play and imagines a ham-fisted note warning Strange to watch his back. “I urge upon you,” Marlowe (via Greenblatt) writes, “by the example of the fable I have staged, to be supremely alert and cunning,” because “someone is always trying to outsmart and destroy you.”

There is, as you might guess, no real evidence that Strange and Marlowe even knew each other personally.

Greenblatt's myth of a Romantic Marlowe almost singlehandedly pushing England into the Renaissance betrays the principles of New Historicism by shortchanging the roles of so many other key players. There's Shakespeare, of course—but not only him. As Daniel Swift reveals in his new book, The Dream Factory: London's First Playhouse and the Making of William Shakespeare, another important kind of brilliance is necessary for the flourishing of the arts: business acumen.

Swift's story is really about the invention of capitalism—and the mad chancers, con artists, and prestidigitators on whom it relies. Shakespeare's and Marlowe's plays owe their existence in part to a man named James Burbage. With his partners, Burbage built an outdoor amphitheater, called the Theatre, on which many others, including the Globe, were based. As Swift makes clear, the Theatre endured only because Burbage was good at improvising and snookering his business partners. His shady dealings were also responsible for much of the knowledge we have about this institution. We might not have Marlowe's day planner, but the legal records of the staggering number of lawsuits in which Burbage was involved as either plaintiff or defendant, thankfully, survive.

Eliot A. Cohen: Hands off Shakespeare

Although some perhapsing and mythmaking inevitably find their way into The Dream Factory, Swift is far more diligent about the factual record than Greenblatt is. He is also nowhere near as vivid a storyteller. Still, to anyone interested in what really happened during the Renaissance, Burbage emerges as a fascinating character—a colorful and daring businessman, constantly doubling down on practices that were, as Swift puts it, “startlingly modern” rather than admitting defeat. He did not own the land on which the Theatre was built, but he spent a great amount of other people's money on its construction and subsequent renovation. A theater under construction generates no income, but as Swift writes, “Burbage had learned—perhaps he intuited it—that it is better to have an asset than to work for a wage. It is better to hold capital than to pay your debts.”

Looming over both of these books is Shakespeare, whose achievements so eclipse those of his contemporaries that they can become difficult to see. Dark Renaissance and The Dream Factory both serve as timely reminders that no single artist can create a golden age. Periods of brilliance such as the one that flourished during the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James I require many different forms of genius. Without Burbage, there would have been no Theatre in which Marlowe's early plays could premiere. Without Marlowe, there might have been no iambic pentameter, and no soliloquies. Without the invention of the joint-stock company, Shakespeare would not have had his greatest asset, a regular group of actors for whom he could write. And we would not be reading about any of these men if Shakespeare had not written plays that would endure for hundreds of years. Dark Renaissance boldly argues that transgressive innovators, far from going out of style, have always been necessary for artistic advancement. But as a scholar who has staked his career on the effect that history has on art, Greenblatt should know that the times are not made by one person alone.

A year later, she wrote an analysis of what she called “the aftermath of Nazi rule.” She found the Old World lacking in civic maturity and commitment compared with her new home, the then-booming United States, noting that “the peoples of Western Europe have developed the habit of blaming their misfortunes on some force out of their reach.” She believed that her adopted country, by comparison, enjoyed a kind of clarity of public vision: “With the possible exception of the Scandinavians,” she wrote, “no European citizenry has the political maturity of Americans, for whom a certain amount of responsibility, i.e., of moderation in the pursuit of self-interest, is almost a matter of course.” Arendt wasn't celebrating a perfect America; rather, she was lauding a people who approached political life with an adult sensibility and a reserve of self-control.

Arendt, and any judicious observer, could not make the same assessment of America today.

The United States is now a nation run by public servants who behave no better than internet trolls, deflecting criticism with crassness and obscenity. The White House press secretary answers a question from a member of the free press—a serious question about who planned a meeting between the American and Russian presidents—by saying, “Your mom did.” The secretary of defense cancels DEI and other policies by saying, “We are done with that shit.” The vice president calls an interlocutor on social media a “dipshit.” The president of the United States, during mass protests against his policies, responds by posting an AI-generated video of himself flying a jet fighter over his fellow citizens and dumping feces on their heads.

Anne Applebaum: Why Trump turned to the sewer

These are not the actions of mature adults. They are examples of crude people displaying their incompetence as they flail about in jobs—including the presidency—for which they are not qualified.

The republic will not fall because Vice President J. D. Vance has decided that swearing is edgy, and the juvenility of American public life did not begin with the Trump administration. But the larger danger under all of this nastiness is that President Donald Trump and his courtiers are using crass deflection and gleeful immaturity as means of numbing society and wearing down its resistance to all kinds of depredations, including corruption and violence. When the U.S. military kills people at sea and Vance, responding to a charge that such actions might be war crimes, responds, “I don't give a shit what you call it,” the goal is not just to boost Vance's hairy-chest cred; it's also to grind others down into accepting the idea of extrajudicial executions.

The collapse of a superpower into a regime of bullies and mean girls and comic-book guys explains much about why American democracy is on the ropes, reeling from the attacks of people who in a better time would never have been allowed near the government of the United States.

For years, Trump has attracted acolytes by being the patron saint of the third string, gathering people who seem to feel, for various reasons, that they were iced out of national politics. Some hold opinions too extreme for any but a Trump administration. Stephen Miller's odious views, including his echoing of Adolf Hitler's rhetoric and his accusation that the president's critics are terrorists, would make him a liability not just in any other administration but even at a family dinner, as remarks from some of his own relatives have suggested.

Other Trump appointees, however, have used personal loyalty as the bridge across the chasm that separates their lack of ability from the jobs they occupy. The experiences of prior Trump appointees suggest that many of the current crew know they are in over their head, which could explain much about their churlish and unprofessional behavior.

Consider the candid admissions of Stephanie Grisham, a press secretary in Trump's first term who later walked away from Trump. In 2021, she explained to New York magazine why she took the job in the first place.

For people like me—and I'm not proud of this—you have a sick sense of pride. All the people who told you how terrible he was? You're like, Oh? He's the nominee, buddy! I'm not proud of that. And then he wins, and you get into the White House, and you're in the White House.

To be fair, many reasonable people have the same kind of awestruck moment when they arrive in Washington. (I certainly felt overwhelmed many years ago when I showed up for my first day of work in the Senate.) But Grisham admits to a deeper insecurity: “I thought that they”—the Trump team—“were the only ones who would ever get me there. My lack of confidence in myself as a single mother and someone who has made mistakes in my past, I thought, Well, this is my only shot. Nobody's gonna ever want me, really, but these people did. So I'll stick around.”

This kind of private insecurity can manifest in public life as childishness and trollishness. Or maybe such behavior is simply a reflection of the man at the top. Like all schoolyard bullies, Trump is crude and surrounds himself with people who will not challenge him. Thus his appointees, instead of rising to their responsibilities as public servants, emulate their boss's shallow swagger. Instead of advising the president, they seek to placate him. Instead of showing leadership, they replace their own dignity with loyalty to Trump and do whatever it takes to stay out of the Eye of Sauron.

Whatever the reason for their immaturity, the effect is miserable policy and a corroded democracy. The public is poorly served and does not get answers to important questions. Tariffs? Inflation? Immigration? Peace or war? Who's responsible for these choices?  Your mother, apparently.

The corruption, mendacity, and incompetence of those in charge are perhaps less astonishing than the willingness of Trump's most loyal supporters to tolerate them all. By now, any other president would have been restrained by Congress or, as happened in 2020, by voters. In Trump's second term, however, his base seems almost eager to forgive him for anything, with the possible exception of his involvement with the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

But Trump's popular support (which is probably firmest in the range of some 35 to 40 percent of the U.S. population but much higher within the GOP) is not as much a mystery as it might appear. Americans of all political leanings have been poisoned for years by memes and disinformation. They have marinated in the nihilism of a culture that regards everything with a kind of post-ironic glib dismissal. (As usual, The Simpsons was ahead of its time: A 1996 episode shows two teens at a music festival, where one asks the other, “Are you being sarcastic, dude?” The other, crestfallen, says: “I don't even know anymore.”)

Perhaps Trump's voters have become like the members of the administration, delighting in the crassness and obscenity that pours out of the president and his circle whenever they are challenged. The White House's approach to social media in particular, as my colleague Ali Breland wrote recently, “now resembles the polemical, trolling, vicious manner of posting” pioneered by white supremacists such as Nick Fuentes and his fans, who have become more visible participants in the MAGA movement during Trump's second term.

Friedrich Nietzsche created a concept that can help us understand this political moment. He imported a word from French to describe a kind of deep-seated anger that goes beyond transitory gripes: ressentiment, a feeling that comes from a combination of insecurity, an amorphous envy, and a generalized sense of resentment. Citizens engulfed by this emotion want to bring others down to what they think is their own underappreciated station and identify scapegoats to bear the blame for their misfortunes, real or imagined. They are driven by grievance and a continual, unfocused sense of injury. Accordingly, they see politics as a way to get even with almost everyone outside of their immediate circle. A Trump voter put out of work during the 2019 government shutdown captured this mentality when she exclaimed: “He's not hurting the people he needs to be hurting.”

Sociologists and political scientists have long been aware of the effects of ressentiment on entire nations, not least because it is often a red flag: a marker of a society ripe for decay into authoritarianism. And that is where the danger lies in the juvenility and coarseness among both the Trump elite and its most loyal supporters, some of whom treat grave issues of national and even global importance as little more than raw material for mean-spirited jokes and obscene memes. This shallow behavior leads to a deadening of the moral and civic spirit that undergirds democracy.

People who are willing to accept “your mom” as an answer to important questions are people who have already decided that democracy is a rigged game. The political process, for many of them, doesn't seem to be a means for solving common problems and developing solid policies. Instead, they treat it as just another opportunity to excoriate their fellow citizens. They may support candidates such as Trump (and the late Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, and the now-imprisoned former leaders Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil) not because they expect responsible government, but because such candidates promise to hurt the right people—to humiliate them, impoverish them, and perhaps even shoot them.

What can other American citizens do when faced with a government that offers trolling and obscenity as replacements for governing? How do people who care about democracy and the rule of law deal with fellow voters who keep electing a class of public officials who seem to be all id and no superego?

Perhaps most important, other Americans should model the behavior they hope to foster in their friends and neighbors. Populist ressentiment is not necessarily produced by inequality. It's driven by a perception of inequality, a sense of being looked down on by others. It is a demand for attention and emotional engagement. But trying to answer that demand is a fool's errand: On social media, for example, some of Trump's voters seem especially enraged not by arguments but by indifference. The whole point of their trolling is to gain attention and then intimidate others.

Both online and in daily life, Americans who are part of the pro-democracy coalition should resist such invitations. Responsible citizens must hold themselves to a higher standard than officials who are acting like grade-schoolers. The national figures, from Trump on down, who put out rancid bait may do so because they want others to argue and lower themselves, and thus prove that no one holds the moral high ground. (Perhaps this is why Trump and so many of his supporters resort to whataboutism when confronted with their behavior.) When these leaders and their followers swear or behave rudely, they may hope and expect that others will do likewise.

As tempting as it is to trade punches to the groin, the better approach is to model mature behavior and demand it in return from people being paid to serve the public. When the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt answered the journalist S. V. Dáte's text-message question about who chose the location of a possible U.S.-Russia summit with “Your mom did,” Dáte texted back: “Is this funny to you?” Leavitt then went full Regina George, calling him a “far left hack” and refusing to answer his “bullshit questions.” Leavitt later posted the exchange on X, where Dáte responded: “Feel better now? Now can you answer the question? Please and thank you.” That's the only way to go: Ask the question, and then ask it again, and keep asking.

This is not Michelle Obama's “When they go low, we go high” argument. (Even she seems to have abandoned that strategy.) Rather, it is a recognition—and a plea—that the voters and candidates who wish to replace this current government must present themselves as stable, responsible, and adult alternatives to a claque of trolls and incompetents. (Even California Governor Gavin Newsom's troll-back of the president, as clever as it was, has run its course.) The right answer now to the faux-macho silliness of someone such as Pete Hegseth is not to produce clever memes and nicknames for the secretary of defense; it is to remind people that Hegseth is acting like a teenager and trying to distract Americans with idiotic slurs about fat soldiers because Pete Hegseth is terrible at his job.

Like most things that require some adulting, this approach is emotionally unsatisfying. And it may not gain much ground if enough Americans have decided that they are satisfied with poop jokes as public policy. The “No Kings” protests, however, are an example of how people can mobilize to mock ridiculous behavior (and do so festively, even) without the mayhem that Trump and his lieutenants seemed to hope would arise.

In addition to marching, Americans who care about democracy must organize and vote in every election, no matter how small or local. And in their personal lives, people who want to restore maturity to national government must be clear with those around them, even if it means risking their personal relationships, that some things, such as glib schoolyard taunts and scatological nonsense from the commander in chief, are not acceptable.

Americans have learned that guardrails are easily destroyed. Restoring them will take time—because they have to be repaired by each of us, one person at a time, making small but important decisions about how we want to live.

The auto industry is at war with Apple.

Among all of Apple's achievements, one of the most underrated has been making driving less miserable. Before Apple CarPlay debuted, about a decade ago, drivers were stuck with whatever clunky tech features were preloaded into their car. By projecting a simplified iPhone layout onto the car's central screen, CarPlay lets you use apps such as Apple Maps and Spotify without fumbling for your phone, make hands-free calls, and dictate text messages. It is seamless, free, and loved by millions of iPhone owners.



Now one of the world's biggest car companies is taking it away. Last month, General Motors CEO Mary Barra announced that new cars made by the auto giant won't support CarPlay and its counterpart, Android Auto. Ditching smartphone mirroring may seem to make as much sense as removing cup holders: Recent preliminary data from AutoPacific, a research firm, suggest that CarPlay and Android Auto are considered must-have features among many new-car shoppers. But according to GM, the company can create an even better experience for drivers by dropping Apple and making its own software. And like it or not, the move says a lot about where the auto industry is headed.



GM has gone as far as invoking Apple in defending its decision: Remove a feature, such as the disk drive on a laptop, and people eventually adapt and move on. A GM spokesperson told me that the change “will happen over time, not overnight” and “if your car supports Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, that will continue.” Before its announcement, GM had already nixed CarPlay and Android Auto in many of its electric vehicles (although it kept the software in its gas-powered vehicles, which GM sells many more of). In my experience test-driving GM's new EVs, the company's replacement software is indeed impressive. It's fast and easy to use, and it offers apps such as Spotify, HBO Max, and, soon, a voice assistant powered by Google's Gemini. But it's not CarPlay. Some popular apps are missing, such as Apple Podcasts and Apple Music.



There is one other crucial difference. Because GM's software isn't tied to a phone like CarPlay is, access to the full suite of software requires its own data plan—through GM, of course. (The cheapest plan costs $10 a month.) Get used to these kinds of subscriptions, regardless of what kind of car you drive. In recent years, automakers have realized how much money they can make from in-car technology: Maybe they charge a subscription fee for hands-free highway cruise control (GM has already had considerable success with that). Maybe they charge for apps that let you control aspects of the car from your phone. Or maybe they sell data that your navigation system collects about where you go and what you do.



Whatever the case, car companies are moving beyond making money only when they sell you a car. For GM, eliminating Apple as a middleman provides more opportunities to charge for things. “It's a turf war, and the car is real estate,” Craig Daitch, an auto-industry analyst and a former GM marketing manager, told me. Tech-first car start-ups such as Tesla and Rivian have never offered CarPlay; the latter argues its own systems are better without the software. (Even so, plenty of owners have hacked work-arounds to add it over the years.)



Although GM is the largest automaker that is ditching CarPlay, other car brands are also locking features behind a paywall. Toyota has some navigation tools that require a subscription, but CarPlay does about the same thing at no cost. I own an older Mazda with a remote-start feature that works every time I hit a button on my key fob; on my newer electric Kia, I have to pay up to $200 a year if I want to unlock that service. (I haven't yet; in fact, study after study shows that consumers are broadly skeptical of more subscription features.)



Some automakers have made a point of proclaiming their allegiance to CarPlay, knowing that's what buyers want. Toyota's EVs tell CarPlay how much electric range they have left, so that Apple Maps can prompt the driver to stop at a nearby charger on a road trip. But the relationship between Detroit and Silicon Valley can be a tense one. Apple sees tremendous value in expanding its presence in your car: The next step is CarPlay Ultra, which enables your phone to control more of your car. Want to fiddle with the temperature? Ask Siri to do it. It's an Apple lover's dream and a car company's worst nightmare. If that feature catches on, companies will just be makers of rolling shells for tech companies. One executive for the French automaker Renault was reportedly blunt with Apple: “Don't try to invade our own system.” (Apple declined to comment.)



No matter what car you drive, the glory days of CarPlay may be numbered. For the auto industry, there's just too much money to be made from creating their own versions. Get ready for a day when your car's technology expenses are another line item on the credit-card statement, right next to the Netflix subscription.

It is appalling for a president to accept private donations to fund a pet project. Just ask the Clintons.  

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The revelation that Donald Trump has demolished the East Wing, with plans to rebuild it at jumbo size with private funds, provoked an initial wave of outrage—followed by a predictable counter-wave of pseudo-sophisticated qualified defenses.

“In classic Trump fashion, the president is pursuing a reasonable idea in the most jarring manner possible,” editorializes The Washington Post. The New York Times' Ross Douthat and The Wall Street Journal's editorial board have similar assessments: We should all calm down, put aside our feelings about the president and the admittedly flawed process by which he arrived at this project, and appreciate the practical value of the new facility.

Let's forget questions of proportion and aesthetics (I could not be less qualified to judge either) and consider the matter solely on the issue of corruption. Trump has funded the project by soliciting donors who have potential or actual business before the government. By traditional standards, this would constitute a massive scandal.

We know this because a very similar scandal occurred about a decade ago. Remember the Clinton Foundation? After the 43rd president left office, he established a charitable foundation to undertake good works: disaster relief, public health, and other largely uncontroversial endeavors.

But the Clinton Foundation became a political liability after reports suggested that it created a potential conflict of interest. Bill Clinton may have retired from elected office, but Hillary Clinton harbored widely known ambitions to run in the future. So the wealthy people and companies that donated to the foundation might have been hoping for access to and gratitude from a potential future president.

Conor Friedersdorf: Donald Trump thinks America needs a better ballroom

Conservatives were not alone in denouncing this arrangement. In August 2016, the Post editorialized that “some donors to the Clinton Foundation may have seen their gifts as means to buy access—and it points to much bigger potential problems. Should Ms. Clinton win in November, she will bring to the Oval Office a web of connections and potential conflicts of interest, developed over decades in private, public and, in the case of her family's philanthropic work, quasi-public activities.” Similar criticism appeared from the likes of NPR (“I think it contributes to all of the concern about her honesty and trustworthiness,” observed the now-late Cokie Roberts), the Times' editorial board, me, and others.

Like pretty much any other pre-Trump complaint, all of this sounds quaint today. But the actual facts of the case are at least as damning. The solicitations for the $300 million ballroom (as of press time—the cost keeps rising) are being made not by a candidate but by a sitting president. The money is going not to charity but to a public project that will, in part, underwrite Trump's luxurious lifestyle. (Imagine if the Clinton Foundation had been building gold-embossed ballrooms for Bill and Hillary to entertain guests in!) While the Clinton Foundation disclosed all its donors, Trump has kept many of his ballroom donors secret.

The greatest difference is that Trump's moves to benefit his friends and hurt his enemies are out in the open, which makes the quid pro quo element far cruder. If donating to a Clinton charity was like buying your date a nice dinner in the hopes of getting lucky, donating to a Trump charity is more like bringing a fistful of cash to a brothel.

The Clintons' conflict of interest drove waves of skeptical coverage and hostile commentary. This concern has yielded barely a footnote in the Trump-ballroom story. The Post brushes off the problem in a clause (“Though the fundraising for the ballroom creates problematic conflicts of interest, two examples validate Trump's aggressive approach”), later noting, almost in passing, that the donors include the Post's owner, Jeff Bezos. Douthat and the Journal's editorial page likewise dispense with the conflict issue in a sentence.

It may well be true that concerns about the corrupting effect of these donations are just too slight against the backdrop of a presidency that has obliterated the wall between public policy and personal gain. I will concede that the East Wing demolition is not the worst thing Trump has done. It may not even rank among the top 1,000 worst things he's done.

David A. Graham: It's already different

But the fact that one of the biggest scandals of the Clintons' careers hardly warrants a harrumph now shows how low the standards of behavior have fallen in Trump's Washington.

I sympathize with the mainstream media's inability to properly capture the breadth of Trump's misconduct. The dilemma is that holding Trump to the standards of a normal politician is impossible. The Times would have to run half a dozen banner-style Watergate-style headlines every day, and the news networks would have to break into regular programming with breathless updates every minute or so. Maxing out the scale of outrage has the paradoxical benefit of allowing Trump to enjoy more generous standards than any other politician has.

Still, although holding Trump accountable to normal expectations of political decorum may be impossible, surely we don't need to praise him for merely committing normal-size scandals. The people losing perspective here are not the ballroom's critics, but its defenders.

Booze is down and weed is up, and that's doing something to us as a country.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

One minor but arresting fact of U.S. history is the huge amount of alcohol the average American consumed in 1830: 7.1 undiluted gallons a year, the equivalent of four shots of 80-proof whiskey every day. Assuming some children wimped out after the first drink, this statistic suggests that large numbers of Jacksonian-era adults were rolling eight belts deep seven days a week, with all the attendant implications for social and political life. Imagine what it was like resolving a buggy accident, let alone conducting a presidential election.

Much has been said about Americans' supposed national virtues—the mercantile ambition, the Protestant work ethic, the rugged individualism—and the particular character they lend the United States, but comparatively little has been said about national vices. Give your 19th-century plowman a dozen hard ciders, though, and see whether that plays a more significant role in his evening than his urge to pull himself up by his bootstraps. Just as personal vices can shape the course of an individual life, so too can national vices influence our collective experience, maybe as much as our virtues—or possibly even more. And those vices are changing.

Compared with our forebears, Americans barely drink now: a mere 2.5 gallons per capita in 2022. The more striking change, though, is that in a Gallup poll released in August, only 54 percent of respondents said they drank at all—the lowest portion since the analytics company started asking the question in 1939. Although doctors surely approve, this downturn is bad news for those of us who use alcohol for its intended purpose—improving the company of others—to say nothing of its off-label uses in dancing, youth-sports spectating, karaoke, etc.

Read: Is moderate drinking okay?

The decline in drinking coincides with a decline in social activity more broadly. A variety of causes have been blamed for this trend toward isolation, phones chief among them. Maybe the phone theory is correct, and maybe it is not; the forces behind broad national trends are endlessly debatable. At the micro level, however, the influences of different vices become more clear. Consider a night out with friends, and the diverging consequences of buying a round of shots versus opening up Instagram.

The systemic effects of millions more people looking at their phones and millions fewer getting drunk remain to be seen. These are not the only changing national vices, however; more Americans are also gambling online, consuming marijuana, and watching pornography than ever before. And these new, ascendant vices are likely to shape American life in the 21st century as much as mass day drinking shaped life in the 19th.

Nearly half of U.S. states have legalized recreational marijuana since 2012, a change that seems to be causing a massive rise in the number of Americans who use cannabis. Although evidence does not indicate how many people who have given up booze are taking up weed, the percentage of Americans ages 19 to 30 who reported consuming marijuana within the past year went up by 56 percent from 2009 to 2023, according to a University of Michigan report. The increase was even higher in the 35-to-50 cohort, whose portion of marijuana users more than doubled during the same period. These statistics do not include use by minors, which my own unscientific observations suggest has increased approximately one million percent since recreational marijuana became legal in my town in 2023.

Read: America's shifting attitudes toward marijuana

Again, these numbers don't mean that Americans are turning to marijuana instead of alcohol. But marijuana consumption has gone up at the same time that alcohol consumption has gone down, and the qualitative differences between being high and being drunk translate to differences in social behavior. For instance, alcohol can legally be consumed in bars, where one often meets and even talks to other people; meanwhile many states that have legalized recreational marijuana prohibit its use where it is sold, forcing the purchaser to take an additional step in order to get high in company. People can still get high together, obviously, but people who drink in bars are more likely to find themselves socializing whether they mean to or not. Customs surrounding the two drugs differ meaningfully, too. Drinking alone on a regular basis is widely stigmatized as a symptom of alcoholism; the stigma against getting high alone, maybe while you listen to your vinyl copy of G N' R Lies and look for that goat you saw in the wood paneling one time, is anecdotally weaker.

Is the confluence of decreasing interest in alcohol and increasing interest in marijuana making Americans socialize less? The question cannot responsibly be answered with any certainty, even if one feels that incidents of people getting riled up and burning down the mill owner's house have gone way down since 1830.

But what is the national character if not a vague feeling? My feeling is that our vices have become more furtive and alone. Consider the massive rise in the most depressing vice I can think of: online gambling. A poll by the Siena College Research Institute found that 48 percent of men ages 18 to 49 have an account with an online sportsbook, an astonishing number that probably has something to do with 39 states having legalized sports betting since 2018. Whereas other forms of gaming require people to sit around the same table, crouch in the same alley, or gather at the same racetrack, online-sportsbook users can gamble in total isolation. Say what you will about gambling's ruinous effects on fortune and family—at least it has historically brought people together. The poker craze of the aughts, for example, created untold numbers of problem gamblers; it also led them to sit with one another for hours at a time. The difference between millions of Americans trying to read one another's facial expressions while they reinforce compulsive behavior and millions hunching over their phones to incur a similar risk is not negligible.

Read: Legalizing sports gambling was a huge mistake

Perhaps the phrase hunching over their phones is better applied, though, to another, lonelier 21st-century vice: internet pornography. Some people watch porn together, of course, but one can reasonably assume that most porn is consumed alone. And although erotic images have existed since the dawn of visual representation, internet video pornography and the multibillion-dollar industry that has developed around it make porn at once more available and more potentially time-consuming than ever before. A single DVD or issue of Penthouse gets old; the supply of free porn on the web is bottomless.

People of different moral persuasions have different perspectives on what constitutes sexual vice and how serious a problem it presents, but at least the analog sexual behaviors that are often frowned upon, such as adultery and promiscuity, require meeting people face-to-face. The combination of erotic and parasocial gratification available on a platform such as OnlyFans makes it possible to spend hours a day on sex without ever touching anyone else—a phenomenon to which the emergence of the term pornosexual attests.

Read: What porn did to American culture

I would like to note here that vice persists for a reason. The simple explanation, favored by both clinicians and moral paragons, is that human beings have evolved poor systems for weighing the immediate pleasures of vice against the long-term costs—so we give in. This psychological mechanism is evident in the serious problems of addiction that can emerge from vices, particularly from alcohol and drug use but also from gambling and, in some assessments, compulsive consumption of porn. Because these individual problems are well known, vice is often blamed for so-called social problems: ongoing crises in public health, increased household debt, broken relationships, and other costs, both quantifiable and uncountable, of people pursuing things that feel good but are ultimately bad for them.

At the same time, I hope some readers will agree that although the old vices had net negative effects on some people's lives, their benefits—for those who pursued vice in moderation—went beyond instant gratification to something more valuable. To spend Saturday night at the bar is, in many cases, to spend time with friends and meet new people. To give in to one's carnal urges is to experience increased oxytocin levels in the short term and, in certain cases, to find lasting companionship. And gambling at a casino, while it is almost never a smart investment, is at least an excuse to get out of the house, chat, and experience the particular type of empathy that comes from losing alongside strangers. Vice can bring people out of themselves to be with others, even if that means coming together to do what they probably should not.

That the new vices are so uniformly solitary suggests that the national character might become more solitary, too. This trend is unsettling, but perhaps more alarming is that large numbers of people could become so oblivious to the upside of vice as to decide that it is better pursued alone. I would hate to think that, in our collective understanding of sex and gambling and getting wasted, so many Americans would conclude that the endorphins are the only point.

Republican leaders need to speak up now, loudly and clearly, against any schemes to put Donald Trump back into the White House yet again.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

American Presidents are plainly meant to be term-limited. The Twenty-Second Amendment, ratified in 1951, spells it out: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”

Donald Trump has sometimes sung a different tune, though. In March, he told NBC News that “there are methods” by which he could continue serving past the end of his term, and that he was “not joking.” Riffing on this, the Trump Organization's website began selling “Trump 2028” paraphernalia. More recently, the former Trump aide Steve Bannon told The Economist that Trump is going to stay in office, and that “there is a plan” for Trump to sidestep term limits, which would be revealed “at the appropriate time.”

Whether Trump is serious (as opposed to just trolling the opposition and staving off lame-duck talk), the uncertainty he has created presents an opportunity to shut down this possibility once and for all. The issue here is not about Trump per se—or Barack Obama, for that matter—but rather about shoring up presidential term limits as a meaningful provision of the U.S. Constitution.

From the December 2025 issue: President for life

These questions are legal ones, but the best solutions are political. If an actual case ever arises, courts may struggle to resolve the matter without causing massive political unrest. Far better to avoid an actual case in the first place. When a president starts talking about constitutional loopholes and third terms, leaders in his party need to push back, with firm and specific support for a strong reading of the Twenty-Second Amendment.

Those who seek to work around the Twenty-Second Amendment rely on a particular reading of its text. Specifically, they say that the amendment bans being elected more than twice, not serving more than twice. That would mean a two-termer could return to office through succession rather than election—if, say, they're vice president when a future president resigns. Trump has conceded that he cannot run for a third term directly, but he endorsed the succession interpretation when he was asked about it last week, saying at first that he would “be allowed to do that” before, mercifully, going on to say that it was “too cute” and “wouldn't be right.”

By any measure, the whole point of the Twenty-Second Amendment was to retire two-termers—not just to keep them off the ballot. There is no indication that anyone in Congress or the ratifying state legislatures thought there was a loophole, let alone that they wanted one. It would be an absurd inversion of the term-limit amendment's purpose to parse its text to allow presidents to stay in power forever, so long as they come in through some sort of back door rather than via election.

That said, some judges or justices could instead focus on the Constitution's plain text, the drafters' clear intentions be damned. Such a judge might note that the amendment's drafters could have used more expansive language. Notably, an earlier draft did just that; the Senate Judiciary Committee's version said that two-termers “shall not be eligible to hold the office of President, or to act as President, for any part of another term.” But the Senate voted to change that language to the “elected” version. A fervently textualist judge might argue that the amendment says what it says, and it doesn't say what it doesn't say, so it bars election but not succession.

Some may argue that a clause in the Twelfth Amendment—“no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States”—should prevent the succession scheme. When the amendment was ratified, in 1804, being “eligible” for the vice presidency and being “electable” were synonymous, a fact that would matter to the many textualist judges who focus on words' meanings at the time they were written. But loophole advocates would say again that the Twenty-Second Amendment allows two-termers to become president through succession, and thus that two-termers are “eligible to the office” of both president and vice president.

Even if two-termers cannot be elected vice president, there are other ways to succeed into the presidency. If the elected vice president resigns, the two-termer could be appointed vice president under Section 2 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, ready to step in when the president resigns. If both the president and vice president are set to resign, the two-termer could be chosen as speaker of the House, next in the line of succession.

A more ominous plot would exploit Section 3 of the Twentieth Amendment. That section authorizes Congress to legislate a succession plan for a scenario in which a new presidential term begins but no one is available to take the oath as president or vice president. This could happen if both members of the winning ticket died, bowed out, were disabled, or were disqualified before being sworn in. It could also happen if there were no winning ticket at all because the election results were unresolved. Congress has legislated that the speaker of the House becomes acting president if there is a double vacancy on Inauguration Day, but Congress could designate the outgoing president to remain president instead.

This would be a terrible idea. It would provide perverse incentives to a two-termer who wanted to stay in office forever—he would just have to make something bad happen to the election or to its winners. An outgoing congressional majority and president, questioning the results of an election that hands the White House to their adversaries, could hold up or deny the results, and could change the line of succession to allow the incumbent president to stay in power in the meantime. Because the president would be staying on without being elected, they would wave off the Twenty-Second Amendment, ignoring its intent.

These are the sorts of dastardly maneuvers that our leaders—particularly those in the president's party who might otherwise support him—need to rule out. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson made a good start when he said on Tuesday that the Twenty-Second Amendment prevents a third term. In March, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said something similar.

While helpful and welcome, these statements need to be stronger and more specific. Both Johnson's and Thune's statements could be construed as ruling out a direct run only, not the succession loophole. Given the way that Trump talks about the issue—saying he could legally avoid the Twenty-Second Amendment, even if he sometimes hedges or backtracks—it would be helpful for Republican leaders to take a more explicit stand against such an interpretation.

Endorsing a strict two-term restriction should not be hard. Polling data show that Americans strongly endorse this limit. An April poll found that in light of the constitutional restraints, 82 percent of Americans (including 62 percent of Republicans) would not support a third Trump term. Going even further, Republican leaders should call for any arguable ambiguity in the amendment to be resolved. Americans would support this, and doing so would strengthen the republic.

From the December 2025 issue: Donald Trump's plan to subvert the midterms is already under way

What would a fix look like? A new constitutional amendment would be the most airtight method. That said, there has never been a successful amendment devoted to a minor semantic reinforcement like this, and it is impossible to amend the Constitution without very broad bipartisan consensus.

Another option would be for Congress to legislate the anti-loophole interpretation. The presidential-succession statute requires that people in the line of succession beyond the vice president must be “eligible to the office of president.” Congress could amend the statute to make it more specific, saying that eligibility is about the Constitution's age, citizenship, residency, and loyalty requirements, and also about the Twenty-Second Amendment.

If a two-termer tried to run for vice president and the eligibility question ended up in court, this new succession statute would not settle the question, but it would send a powerful message about Congress's understanding of these constitutional requirements. Moreover, to the extent that the courts left the eligibility question to Congress to resolve when its joint session counts electoral votes every four years on January 6, the statute would send a powerful message to those proceedings, too.

The people are the ultimate enforcers here. The more decisively political leaders from both parties reject the loophole interpretation, the less public support any two-termer would get for any constitutional shenanigans, and the higher the political cost would be to those who would aid and abet them. Such action is a worthy pursuit for a republic that hopes to endure.

How it feels to be a Muslim New Yorker and see Islamophobia wielded against Mamdani.

As the New York City mayoral election enters the final stretch, with the Muslim American Democratic Party nominee Zohran Mamdani maintaining a sizable lead in all of the polls, a familiar beast has reared its head: blatant Islamophobia.

Most of those dabbling in outright bigotry are unsurprising: right-wing shock-jocks and the pro-Trump New York Post. But what has made many of these forays into the gutter most surprising — and disconcerting — is that they've been endorsed, either tacitly or explicitly, by Mamdani's chief rival, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who lost to Mamdani in the Democratic Party's primary election but has continued running as an independent candidate.

When, for example, a right-wing radio host told Cuomo that Mamdani would be “cheering” if there were another 9/11-style terrorist attack on New York, Cuomo did not only fail to challenge this bigoted smear; he chuckled, then added, “That's another problem.” And when Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo suggested that Mamdani would force women in New York City to “cover up” — which, she claimed, was already the case in “largely Muslim” London — Cuomo not only let the smear go unchallenged, but noted that Mamdani is “dual citizenship” (he was born in Uganda) before saying he “just doesn't understand the New York culture,” including “what 9/11 meant.”

Some observers believe Cuomo, who needs to consolidate support from every anti-Mamdani voter possible to have a chance to win, is knowingly stoking Islamophobia, one of New York City's longest and — especially since 9/11 — ugliest political traditions. Mamdani seemed to suggest as much himself when he said in a recent speech: “In an era of ever-diminishing bipartisanship, Islamophobia has emerged as one of the few areas of agreement,” and evoked the fear his friends and family had felt walking the streets as Muslim New Yorkers.

That fear is well-grounded, as Debbie Almontaser, a senior adviser of Emgage, a nonprofit focused on organizing Muslim Americans, knows all too well. Almontaser was once herself the victim of an anti-Muslim smear campaign, but even she believes that the attacks on Mamdani have taken politicized Islamophobia “to another level.”

Recently, I spoke with Almontaser about political Islamophobia, what it's like to be a Muslim New Yorker watching Mamdani's campaign, and the potential significance of him becoming the first Muslim mayor in the city's history. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

Have you been surprised by the level of Islamophobic vitriol directed at Zohran Mamdani in these closing weeks?

I have not been surprised at all. Every election cycle, for as long as I can remember in the post 9/11 world, we've seen Islam and Muslims becoming a political football, and we've seen candidates using Islam and Muslims as a boogeyman. What does surprise me is how blatant the racism and Islamophobia towards Zohran Mamdani has been. It's been taken to another level.

What effect do you think these smears have had on Muslim New Yorkers?

It's been a very contentious time to be a Muslim resident in New York, knowing that there is so much hate out there and that it is being spread by people who are leaders of organizations, leaders of companies. I'm deeply saddened because the other thing that people who engage in this vitriol do not understand is the impact that this has on our children, and our community, the social and emotional impact that it has. I just wish that they would wake up and understand what they're doing is dividing our communities and creating needless hostility.

How has the Muslim community responded?

I have seen a huge surge of Muslim young people who have actually rolled up their sleeves and dedicated themselves to phone banking, door-knocking, and other forms of political organizing. I've also seen a huge surge of young people who are Muslim and South Asian who actually have registered to vote.

“The sleeping giant that others have dismissed — the community of Muslim and South Asian New Yorkers, as well as their many allies across the city more broadly — will be fully awake and ready to be much more involved in New York City and state politics.”

What has made this an exciting moment — not just for New Yorkers, but for American Muslims and South Asians across the country — is that there is a candidate with whom they have a personal affinity. Mamdani from their community, from their ethnic or racial background; and his message, his charisma, his commitment to the people, is giving these people a renewed sense of hope that we can actually be a part of a larger community that shares the same values that Zohran has been articulating.

In a recent speech, which you attended as a sign of support and solidarity, Mamdani said: “To be Muslim in New York is to expect indignity.” What did you make of that? Did it resonate?

It absolutely resonated with me. It took me back to my own personal story, when, in 2007, I was the target of a national smear campaign after I founded the Khalil Gibran International Academy. So I truly understand what he meant by that. But we are fighting that by continuing to make our voices heard and to show that we love our city and that we care about our fellow neighbors, and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are a part of the change that our city deserves and our country deserves.

Comparing Mamdani's campaign now to your experiences in 2007, do you see changes in how the broader political community responds to Islamophobia?

The number of people who stood up for me back in 2007 was very small. And it was pretty devastating.

But if there's anything that has changed from then to now, it's the number of people who've come out in defense of Zohran from the Democratic Party — which has been wonderful to see and is certainly a change from what I experienced.

New York's current attorney general, Letitia James, was there for me and by my side in 2007, when she was a city council member, and she spoke out vehemently against the attacks on me. State Sen. Robert Jackson — who, at that time, was a councilman — he stood up for me too, as did state Sen. John Liu, who at that time was a councilman. So the shift, among Democrats at least, is pretty profound.

Some people have compared what's happening to Mamdani to the hysteria that surrounded the attempt to build an Islamic community center in downtown Manhattan during the early years of Obama's presidency. What do you make of that parallel?

The so-called Ground Zero Mosque in lower Manhattan — that was also another pivotal moment where we saw the ugly side of history. But at the same time, I met so many people when I went to interfaith meetings who were trying to galvanize support for the project and to make sure that we did not infringe on a community's freedom of religion.

And I believe that what we are seeing with Zohran is that more people — people who know what happened to me, and who saw me standing by him in front of that mosque during his speech — have decided, we cannot let New York do this again to another Muslim political activist.

I've received so many messages along the lines of: We remember what happened to you. It was profound to see you standing there with him. We cannot let what happened to you, and what happened to the organizers of the Islamic community center, happen again.

How would you say Mamdani is handling Islamophobic attacks, compared to Muslim politicians in the past?

What I have appreciated and respected so immensely about Zohran is that he has run his campaign for the people of New York City. It's never been about him. It's never been about his personal identities. It's been about what the people need and what he wants to deliver for them.

But he also saw that those bigoted attacks on him were not just impacting his life. For example, I should point out that, in June, as his campaign began gaining traction and the attacks on him by Cuomo and others became more menacing, a Muslim woman on the subway here in New York City was actually asked by someone, “Are you Muslim?” And she obviously looked Muslim — she's wearing a hijab — and he beat her.

I think Mamdani saw the danger that this was having, not only for him and his family but also for many members of New York's Muslim and South Asian communities. And him giving that profound speech this month in front of the mosque was a way to say: There are 1 million Muslims in New York, and we can't afford to continue doing politics in a way that will endanger innocent people.

What's your read on how Andrew Cuomo thinks about Muslim voters?

We at Emgage have been organizing our community across the state, setting up meetings with political and community leaders from the different regions of the state and engaging them on a whole host of issues.

We started this when Gov. [Kathy] Hochul ran for governor, where we actually did a couple of meet-and-greets with leaders from across the state. And I should say, this was really the first opportunity — because, remember, her predecessor was Andrew Cuomo. And Andrew Cuomo had zero respect for American Muslims in the state. When he was governor, he never visited a mosque — and the only time that leaders such as myself heard from him was when he was running again.

I basically was like, I'm sorry. I've been here for the last four years. We should have been engaging over those four last years for us to work together and do things. There are people who believe in our communities and understand the power that our communities yield. And I believe that during this election cycle, the sleeping giant that others have dismissed — the community of Muslim and South Asian New Yorkers, as well as their many allies across the city more broadly — will be fully awake and ready to be much more involved in New York City and state politics.

﻿How do you sell America when no one agrees on what America is?

Every product sells itself with a story. The story Ford tells us is that its cars are America.

Ford has described itself as the most American automaker. They make their cars in America, and have since Henry Ford developed the automobile assembly line and used it to build the Model T in 1913. So American is it that the Japanese prime minister recently parked a Ford F-150 truck outside the venue for her meeting with President Donald Trump in an attempt to curry favor. (“That's a hot truck,” Trump said.)

So effective and evocative is Ford's myth-making that it has even influenced the narratives of economic policy. Part of the subtext of Trump's tariffs is that they were going to bring back the America of Ford's glory days, the one where strapping blue-collar men worked good factory jobs and could provide for their families. (Ford CEO Jim Farley has said the tariffs will actually drive up Ford costs.)

But the America that Ford is selling has changed over time. Watched in succession, Ford ads tell us the story of what America is ready to pay money to believe itself to be. If we look at Ford right now, we're seeing what America thinks it can sell in a moment with a powerful amount of anxiety over what American is all.

One of Ford's most iconic early ads came in 1924. As sales of the Model T sank, Ford aimed to reenergize their market by publishing a series of lavish oil-painting spreads showing the great infrastructure the company was building: their factories, their foundries, the benefits they offered employees. They would teach America that Ford was not just the maker of an affordable car but the maker of Fordism: a capitalist, consumerist way of life that was new and distinctly American.

The campaign failed, and Model T sales kept going down, but one of the ads from that period was so optimistic and romantic that in 2013, amid an attempt to revive the faltering Lincoln Town Car brand, Ford republished it as the center of a rebranding campaign.

“Opening the highways to all mankind,” the repurposed ad said, over a painting of a nuclear family piling out of their Model T to gaze across the sunset-tinted vista of the great land Ford had made available to them. “Back of all the activities of the Ford Motor Company,” the ad went on, “is this Universal idea — a whole-hearted belief that riding on the people's highway should be within easy reach of all the people.”

The angle here was populist and democratic, an American ideal at its heart. Travel should be within the reach of the middle class. It should not be the sole province of the rich. Taxpayer money went to building the highways, so taxpayers should get to use them. That was the American dream.

The ad also told us what America wasn't. America was a land where people traveled in their little family units, not mingling together on trains, as they did in Europe. It was a land where the social unit was the nuclear family — mother, father, and two children — not intergenerational groups or any other kind of kin. And it was a land that belonged to the straight, white, and middle class.

Most importantly, though, that early Ford ad shows a company and a country that is looking forward. Ford is actively opening up the highways — new highways that Congress had only legislated into existence three years earlier. America was unfolding itself, coming into the American century, and Ford was part of what was going to get it there. The future was bright and it was America's and Ford's for the taking.

In the optimistic, cosmopolitan Obama era, Ford was once again selling us an America on the upswing. “What's next?” a 2015 ad asked. It answered itself: “Things you never saw coming.”

In this utopian world, everyone had access to the machismo of a Ford Mustang — including women. One 2013 ad informed us that “everyone has an inner Mustang” as a little girl in a pink tutu stared, transfixed and adoring, at a black Mustang.

Another from 2015 depicted a woman of fashionably indeterminate ethnicity driving confidently across a city as Rachel Platten's “Fight Song” blasted in the background. This ad came before Hillary Clinton chose the song for her presidential campaign. Nonetheless, it expresses a country in which feminism had become briefly chic enough to be considered a great way to sell cars, and the elite consensus was that America's next president would surely be a woman.

Today's Ford ads aren't exclusionary, per se. Brief representational TV spots make it clear they are happy to take money from Black women, Black men, Latinos, and liberal women in general. Still, Ford ads today come with an overwhelming emphasis on culture war signifiers that tend toward the right.

There are Ford ads about how the modern world and its decadent cities have corrupted us away from the beauties of rural life, but Ford can reconnect us. There are Ford ads contrasting feminized email jobs with the honest manual labor done by Ford customers. There is even a five-minute Ford documentary about the making of the Truckle, a Western-style cowboy belt buckle — “handcrafted by lifelong Ford Truck owner, rodeo legend, and master buckle maker Andy Andrews” — designed to not only hold your pants up but also to hold the key fob to your Ford F-150 for you.

What characterizes this moment in Ford's iconography most strongly, though, is a sense of defensiveness, even resentment. One 2024 ad, built to commemorate the Detroit Lions's entrance into Ford Field for the NFC Championship game, makes much of the toughness of Detroit brands. “Up here, we don't have the luxury of stumbling into a winning season,” goes the voiceover from actor Jeff Daniels. “We aren't handed easy victories. We aren't handed anything. We have to reach and grab and fight, because there are no shortcuts here.”

On one level, the language is a congratulations from one scrappy Detroit underdog to another. On a different level, it's speaking to a sense of resentment that has characterized Trump's America: All that I was promised has been taken away from me, I have been given nothing, and so I have had to scramble tooth and claw for all my many victories.

That story of resentment is what sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild calls “the deep story…a story in which you lift away facts and moral judgment and just find the story that feels true.” In 2011, attempting to understand the rise of what was then known as the Tea Party, Hochschild visited Louisiana's conservative bayou country to understand the deep story that people there were telling each other. In 2016, she summarized it to Vox like this:

Think of people waiting in a long line that stretches up a hill. And at the top of that is the American dream. And the people waiting in line felt like they'd worked extremely hard, sacrificed a lot, tried their best, and were waiting for something they deserved. And this line is increasingly not moving, or moving more slowly [i.e., as the economy stalls].

Then they see people cutting ahead of them in line. Immigrants, blacks, women, refugees, public sector workers. And even an oil-drenched brown pelican getting priority. In their view, people are cutting ahead unfairly. And then in this narrative, there is Barack Obama, to the side, the line supervisor who seems to be waving these people (and the pelican) ahead. So the government seemed to be on the side of the people who were cutting in line and pushing the people in line back.

Since Trump first took office, Hochschild's “deep story” has animated more and more of conservative rhetoric, regardless of its relationships to the facts on the ground. It's behind Trump's fixation with the idea that he is self-made, the obsession with elites who have not had to work as hard as you have and look down on you even so, the apparent belief that getting rid of immigrants will fix everything. Most of the ideas underpinning these preoccupations are not true, but they feel true enough to power a whole political movement.

If Ford is selling the idea that its cars are America, the America Ford is selling us today is no longer blazing with industry, rose-tinted and forward-gazing. Now, it is closed-in, self-regarding, self-hating, furious. It is a country that is no longer willing to buy optimism.

There's too much news. We help you understand what you really need to know. Vox delivers the depth, context, and clarity you need to understand what's happening and why it matters.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

“Setting boundaries” is broken — but there's a different way to think about caring for yourself and others.

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. It's based on value pluralism — the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity:

I'm the only child of divorced parents. Both of my parents require different levels of help. One is incredibly poor and trying to take care of my grandparents. The other does not have computer literacy and English isn't their main language. I help with my attention, money, and time whenever I can, because at the end of the day, we're all we got. 

This desire to help has bled into other portions of my life. One of my best friends went through a personal crisis and had to move out the same day, and I packed everything. During the very beginning of Covid, I drove to the ER in a rental car to help a different friend. There's a migrant mother on my corner who I pass every day, who knows that I will give whatever I can. She's called me during work, and every time I think she's about to get deported, but she's just calling me to ask for groceries. 

Of course, this is all at a cost to myself. I've worked very hard over the last few years with a therapist to learn to say no and set boundaries — and I graduated from therapy!

But the problem is that I don't want to say no, and when I do, it's because I know if I say yes, I will fall down a slippery slope of absorbing more responsibility that isn't mine to hold. That feels like an insufficient reason to not help others — something I believe is important to do. Not for any particular moral/religious reason or because I worry that I'm a bad person. Frankly, I don't give a damn about that. But I do care about the well-being of those in my orbit immensely. 

My fear is that I know that I will give, give, give until I'm nothing. Any act of self-preservation feels like a slight at my own ideals, but resentment bubbles away anyhow because I'm so overextended. 

Dear Beyond Boundaries,

You've worked hard in therapy (yay!) and have learned to say that magic word (“no”). Yet you're not convinced in your bones that you should want to set boundaries. And I actually think you're picking up on something real there.

To be clear, I think self-preservation is every bit as important as self-sacrifice — especially for people like me and (by the sounds of it) you, who grew up as “parentified” children focused on taking care of others' needs.

But I think the popular language of “boundaries” isn't quite passing the sniff test for you — and for good reason. We're taught that “a boundary is a limit or edge that defines you as separate from others” — it's “where I end and where you begin,” to quote a couple of popular therapists. Yet if you believe, as I do, that we're all actually profoundly interconnected and interdependent, that we're constantly influencing and shaping reality for one another, then that idea of boundaries may feel like it muddies more than it clarifies. Is it really possible to draw a sharp line between ourselves and other people?

Feel free to email me at sigal.samuel@vox.com or fill out this anonymous form! Newsletter subscribers will get my column before anyone else does and their questions will be prioritized for future editions. Sign up here!

Pop psychology further assures us that although boundaries might feel selfish, they're really the opposite: The more you protect your own well-being today, the more you'll be able to help others tomorrow! But this is weirdly instrumentalizing: It treats you as a means to an end, not an end in yourself. It makes it sound like your actions are only justifiable if their ultimate aim is to serve others' needs — exactly the sort of “self-sacrifice is all that matters” mentality that boundaries are meant to get you away from.

To make matters worse, some people bastardize the concept of boundaries by brandishing boundary language as a cover for avoidance. We've all got that friend (or Instagram influencer) who says, “Nope, I'm drawing a boundary!” anytime they're being asked to do something that would be even a little hard or uncomfortable.

You write that any act of self-preservation feels like a slight at your own ideals. The answer is not to just give up on self-preservation — that approach can literally kill you. Instead, you need an ideal that both honors the importance of self-preservation and offers you a moral vision you can actually believe in.

So allow me to present Indra's net, a classic Buddhist metaphor that originated in ancient India.

Picture an infinite net stretching out across the universe (a bit like a spiderweb). At each node where the threads intersect, there's a jewel (a bit like a dewdrop that sits on the spiderweb). And each jewel is so shiny and reflective that it contains the image of every other jewel in the entire net. Which means each jewel also contains the reflections of the reflections, and the reflections of those reflections, on and on forever.

This is reality, the Buddhists say. No jewel exists as a separate, boundaried entity: Change one jewel, and every jewel in the net transforms too, because they're all reflecting each other. Change one person, and every person changes too.

The idea that everything is constantly remaking everything else is what Buddhist philosophers call “dependent co-arising” or “interdependent origination” or sometimes “interbeing,” but honestly, you don't need any fancy terminology to understand it. If you've ever walked outside early in the morning and seen a spiderweb covered with dew drops, with each dew drop reflecting everything else around it, you get the basic idea.

I think picturing yourself as part of this web might really help you. If you see yourself as one of the jewels in the net, you immediately realize a couple things. First, there is no sharp distinction marking off “where I end and where you begin.” And you don't take care of yourself today so that you can better take care of me tomorrow. You take care of yourself because you are one of the jewels in the net — you are inherently precious! And if you mess up your own well-being, you are smudging up one of the jewels, or worse, creating a rip in the net!

Yes, smudging up your jewel will change the reflections in all the other jewels, so it's a problem on the level of how you affect others. But it's also just a problem on the local level: You have failed to treat one of the jewels as precious. You've caused a rip. That is not morally praiseworthy.

I've written before about contemporary philosopher Susan Wolf's concept of the “moral saint” — someone who tries to make all their actions as morally good as possible. Wolf argues that this is actually a bad ideal, because if you're doing constant self-sacrifice, you end up living a life bereft of the personal projects, relationships, and experiences that make up a life well lived.

“If the moral saint is devoting all his time to feeding the hungry or healing the sick or raising money for Oxfam, then necessarily he is not reading Victorian novels, playing the oboe, or improving his backhand,” she writes. “A life in which none of these possible aspects of character are developed may seem to be a life strangely barren.”

It's clear that Wolf finds this sort of life distasteful. But your question prompted me to ask myself: What is it, exactly, that makes it so distasteful? Why does it actually give Wolf — and me — the ick?

I would argue it's because someone who is hyper-focused on giving to others is refusing some of the great gifts of life. Life is constantly offering us gifts. The taste of an unusually good meal. The pleasure of feeling your body move on the dance floor. The intimacy you feel in a late-night conversation with a friend. The specific, delicious, bright shade of green you see on the underside of leaves when the sun shines through them at four o'clock.

When someone offers you a gift — as life is offering you just by giving you a healthy body and mind and a beautiful planet — the gracious thing to do is accept it and enjoy it.

And when I picture the jewels in Indra's net, I imagine that it's basking in the light of all these gifts, that makes the jewels really gleam. If you don't let yourself experience and savor all these things and feel well and happy and fulfilled, I suspect you are dulling yourself. That does not improve the net. It detracts from it.

Of course, caring for the well-being of others can itself be extremely gratifying. But the problem creeps in when you let that crowd out everything else, ultimately tarnishing your own well-being. The language you use to describe your current state — “my fear is that I know that I will give, give, give until I'm nothing” and “resentment bubbles away anyhow because I'm so overextended” — tells me you're putting too much of your energy into caring for others and not enough into caring for yourself.

Feeling fear and resentment while offering “charity” or “service” or “help” to others is not actually being in right relation with others — it's an all-too-common form of martyrdom that sets up a hierarchical dynamic between a long-suffering “giver” and a passive “receiver.” The alternative is to stay horizontal, to think “I'm a jewel in the net, you're a jewel in the net, and I'll offer whatever I can offer without damaging my well-being — without ripping my part of the net.”

So, dear reader, play with finding that balance. You'll know you've found it when you don't feel resentful — you just feel tightly connected to others, and gleaming.

How doctors learned to stop childhood food allergies.

If, like me, you're a parent of a young child, there's one thing you've come to fear above all else. (And no, it's not “Golden” from KPop Demon Hunters played for the 10,000th time, though that's a close second.)

It's the humble peanut. Even if your child isn't allergic to the nuts, past surveys have shown as many as 4.5 percent of kids in the US are, which means consistently scouring lunchboxes and snack packs for even traces of peanuts. And for a long time, this problem was getting worse — the self-reported prevalence of peanut or tree nut allergies among children in the US more than tripled between 1997 and 2008.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

So here's a rare public health win you can feel at the playground: Researchers at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) compared peanut and food allergies before pediatric guidelines about feeding changed in 2017 and after, and found that infants and toddlers are being diagnosed with far fewer food allergies now. Comparing pre-guideline rates with the post-2017 period, diagnoses of any food allergy were about 36 percent lower — driven largely by a roughly 43 percent drop in peanut allergy.

The sharp reduction in peanut allergies doesn't just make it easier for parents to pack lunches across the country. It represents “prevention of a potentially deadly, life-changing diagnosis,” Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a pediatrician at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, told the New York Times. And it happened because public health researchers looked hard at the science, realized what they were doing to prevent allergies wasn't working — and changed tack.

For years, well-meaning medical advice told parents that the way to protect children from developing food allergies was to delay the introduction of allergenic foods. In 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) laid out the following timetable for parents: delay introduction of cow's milk until an infant is 1 year old, eggs until 2 years old, and nuts and fish until age 3.

Infant immune and gut systems are still immature, so waiting until children were older and those systems had more fully developed to introduce potentially allergenic foods seemed to make sense, and the advice was widely adopted by parents.

But that reasoning began to unravel in 2015 with the LEAP trial, a gold-standard randomized trial that found that high-risk babies who started peanuts early and kept eating it through childhood had about an 80 percent lower risk of developing a peanut allergy by age 5, compared to those kept off the nuts. Follow-up work showed that protection persisted into adolescence.

The shift reveals the value of dual-exposure: Early oral exposure to allergenic proteins found in foods like peanuts trains the immune system to tolerate them, while exposure through inflamed skin — common in babies with eczema — primes sensitization. So the new guidelines pushed safe oral introduction in the first half-year in forms infants can handle, like thinned peanut butter or puffs as opposed to whole nuts.

What followed was evidence-driven public health at its best. The data was strong enough to trigger a policy 180: A 2017 addendum to the guidelines urged parents to introduce peanuts between 4 and 6 months. A 2021 consensus document from allergists and immunologists went further, also recommending the introduction of egg and other allergens at the same age. It's one of those rare times when the science was clear, the guidance became clear, and the desired outcomes followed, as the new study from CHOP demonstrated.

The CHOP team mined AAP-affiliated electronic health records to compare results from before and after the updated guidelines. Peanut allergy diagnoses fell from 0.79 percent to 0.45 percent among infants and toddlers, while any IgE-mediated food allergy — an immune reaction to specific food proteins that triggers the release of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which is what drives allergy symptoms — fell from 1.46 percent to 0.93 percent. Notably, peanuts even dropped from the most common allergy culprit to number two, with egg moving to first — exactly what you'd expect given that the AAP's intervention was initially peanut-specific.

The researchers estimate the shift has already prevented tens of thousands of cases — on the order of around 40,000 peanut allergies, and some 60,000 food allergies overall — since 2015. That's a huge payoff for what boils down to something as simple and cheap as giving your 5-month-old the occasional peanut.

And there are likely even more gains to be realized, because the adoption of the new allergy guidance has been real but incomplete: Only about 29 percent of pediatricians reported fully implementing the 2017 recommendations a couple of years in, with somewhat higher compliance from allergists. The fact we still saw such sharp declines in allergies suggests the effects could be even bigger as awareness spreads among doctors and parents alike.

Peanut allergies are no joke. They tend to persist for life, they drive a disproportionate share of all severe allergic reactions, and dealing with them reshapes daily life in everything from school parties to air travel. Preventing even a slice of new cases means fewer EpiPens in backpacks, fewer late-night ER runs, and less of the background anxiety that families of allergic kids know too well. And there's a real economic dividend: Estimates put the annual US economic burden of childhood food allergies at around $25 billion, or around $4,000 per affected child per year. Prevent those allergies from ever developing in the first place, and you lighten that load for years.

But there's a broader lesson for health here that goes well beyond allergies. When a large, decisive trial shows an actionable prevention behavior, change the guidance decisively, say it simply, and measure outcomes in the real world. Then close the implementation gap with better clinician prompts, clearer parent handouts, and practical tips for high-risk families.

Scientific expertise is under threat as never before — and some of that criticism is warranted. But If you're looking for evidence that public health can change its mind in the face of countervailing evidence, here it is, delivered in baby-safe spoonfuls.

OpenAI announced a $38 billion partnership with Amazon's AWS on Monday, its first major cloud computing deal since striking a new agreement with Microsoft that gave it more flexibility.

OpenAI will use AWS compute, which consists of ""hundreds of thousands of state-of-the-art Nvidia GPUs,"" according to a joint statement between the companies.

Amazon shares were up more than 5% in premarket trading on the news. The deal is the latest example of a cloud provider leveraging its massive size to provide resources to compute-hungry AI companies.

The partnership also underscores OpenAI's ongoing desire for more computing resources to train and run its frontier AI models, as well as its consumer products, such as ChatGPT, as it races to achieve the holy grail in the AI race: AGI.

""AWS's leadership in cloud infrastructure combined with OpenAI's pioneering advancements in generative AI will help millions of users continue to get value from ChatGPT,"" the announcement said.

OpenAI's new definitive agreement with Microsoft, announced last week as part of OpenAI's restructuring to a more traditional for-profit business, removed the tech giant's power to have first refusal on cloud computing deals. Microsoft, an early investor in OpenAI, now has a roughly 27% in OpenAI Group PBC, a newly formed for-profit public benefit corporation.

OpenAI said it will use Amazon's AWS infrastructure ""to run and scale OpenAI's core artificial intelligence (AI) workloads starting immediately."" The announcement also says the partnership ""will have continued growth over the next seven years.""

""Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute,"" OpenAI co-CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. ""Our partnership with AWS strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.""

After starting last week with 14,000 layoffs, Amazon ended the week on a high note with third-quarter earnings topping expectations and disclosures about how the company has made progress on AI.

With AI companies' valuations growing, along with their spending commitments, there's been growing concern on Wall Street over a possible bubble amid increasingly circular deal structures and dependencies between leading companies.

Under Altman's leadership, OpenAI has paved the way for many of the recent blockbuster agreements. He and his top lieutenants have repeatedly said one of the biggest problems facing OpenAI is the lack of compute. All told, OpenAI has previously lined up $1.4 trillion in spending commitments in the coming years for roughly 30 gigawatts of capacity.

During a recent livestream, Altman said there have been conversations around OpenAI about how to build a compute factory that would allow OpenAI to create 1 gigawatt of compute per week.

The USS New Jersey is a battleship of superlatives.

Fastest battleship ever built? Check. The ship's fastest speed was a record-setting 35.2 knots, or a little over 40 miles per hour, in 1968.

Longest battleship ever built? Check. At 887 feet and 7 inches long, the USS New Jersey is almost three football fields long, and 5 feet longer than the Titanic.

Most-decorated battleship in US history? Check, again. The USS New Jersey earned 19 battle stars throughout its career.

Originally built for combat in World War II, the USS New Jersey was so powerful and irreplaceable that the Navy kept recommissioning it until the 1990s. After it was decommissioned for the last time, it was transformed into a museum based in its namesake state where visitors can explore spaces such as the combat engagement center, officers' staterooms, and gun turrets.

Just don't expect to be able to see the entire ship.

""I've been here eight years now,"" Ryan Szimanski, curator of Battleship New Jersey, told Business Insider. ""I still have not been in all 1,600 rooms.""

Take a look inside the USS New Jersey.

The 45,000-ton ship cost around $150 million to build in the 1940s, or around $2 billion in 2025 when adjusted for inflation.

Reagan was the first sitting president to commission a battleship.

After serving in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf, it was decommissioned for the final time in 1991. The ship opened to the public as a museum in 2001.

The museum, operated by Battleship New Jersey, offers daily self-guided and guided tours. Self-guided tours for adults cost $30, while guided tours cost $40. Tickets can be purchased through Battleship New Jersey.

The USS New Jersey's shore bombardment capabilities made it irreplaceable from World War II through the 1980s.

""Even though aircraft carriers rendered battleships obsolete nominally in World War II, in the '50s, they bring the ship back. In the '60s, they bring the ship back. In the '80s, they bring the ship back. Because to this day, we haven't developed a platform that can cheaply provide that shore bombardment,"" Szimanski said.

The Mark 7 16-inch guns were last fired in combat on February 26, 1984, during the Lebanese Civil War.

They're called 16-inch guns because they could fire 16-inch shells — the actual barrels themselves are 66.7 feet long. The explosive rounds weighed 1,900 pounds and armor-piercing rounds weighed 2,700 pounds — about the same as a Kia Soul.

The 16-inch guns could hit targets up to 23 miles away.

""Pull the trigger on that,"" Szimanski said, pointing to a M2 Browning machine gun on the deck.

Far be it from me to disobey a direct order. I squeezed the trigger, unleashing the sound effect of firing 485 to 635 rounds per minute.

This particular gun was a replica, but visitors to the USS New Jersey can fire blanks from its 5-inch or 40mm saluting guns upon making a donation to the museum.

During the Korean War in 1951, Oesterwind was fatally wounded by shrapnel from a North Korean shell while attacking a North Korean transportation hub. Though the shell didn't break through the ship's armor, three other sailors were wounded, and parts of the ship sustained superficial damage.

The green line serves as the introductory tour, bringing visitors through crew members' bunks, the officers' wardroom, the captain's cabin, and museum exhibit spaces.

The red line focuses on weapons and navigation, with stops like the combat engagement center and missile deck.

The yellow line features an inside look at the crew's life on board, highlighting the library, barber shop, and laundry facilities.

Finally, the blue line tour, titled ""Into the Citadel,"" includes the engine rooms, a 16-inch turret barbette, and the World War II-era radio room.

Szimanski guided me through a combination of these routes for a broader look at the ship, but if you do all four as they're laid out, it's 1 ½ miles long and covers 200 of the ship's 1,600 rooms.

The USS New Jersey was designed to hold 2,000 crew members, but during War War II, there were 2,700 sailors on board. When there weren't enough bunks, sailors slept in hammocks.

By the end of the ship's career, the crew was down to around 1,600.

The crew members who slept in communal spaces like this were often lower-ranking sailors who were newer to the Navy, such as the gunner's mates who operated the ship's 16-inch guns.

Around 3,000 former crew members have visited the museum since it opened in 2001, Szimanski said.

Officers were seated by rank and only began eating once the executive officer, or XO, gave the signal.

Unlike enlisted crew members, officers paid for all of their meals.

Reason was the first Black four-star admiral in the US Navy. From 1989 to 1990, he commanded Battle Group Romeo, of which the USS New Jersey was the flagship, in the Persian Gulf.

Reason told the museum that he read classified information at a desk in his bedroom, but otherwise spent most of his time working at a larger desk in the stateroom.

The desk in the USS New Jersey's stateroom was taken from another 1980s-era ship at the Navy Yard.

The spacious room was meant to impress foreign leaders … and intimidate them.

""It's very specifically placed right here so that when dignitaries come across the gangway, they have to walk past the gun turrets to get here,"" Szimanski said.

Another third of the silver service is on display at the New Jersey governor's mansion in Princeton, while the remaining third's whereabouts are unknown.

The Combat Engagement Center, or CEC, was added to the USS New Jersey when the ship was recommissioned in the 1980s. It featured more modern equipment such as the Tomahawk Weapons System for launching Tomahawk missiles, and sensors including Air Search and Surface Search radars.

Volunteers worked to make the CEC as realistic as possible with screens showing mock-ups of how the computers functioned. Much of this equipment is still used on modern Navy ships.

""We haven't figured out with 100% certainty that we carried nuclear weapons, but we were certainly nuclear-capable,"" Szimanski said.

About two years ago, a new staff member was cleaning out a predecessor's office and found a box of keys. Upon closer examination, the museum realized the keys had brass tags that read ""nuclear PTF,"" which stands for ""permission to fire.""

When museum staffers tested the keys in the ""nuclear perm to fire"" lock in the combat engagement center, they fit inside.

""The Navy just left the original keys on board, the museum had them, and we didn't know we had them for over 20 years,"" Szimanski said.

A ladder leads from the admiral's state room up to the admiral's bridge for easy access. The four chairs in this space were reserved exclusively for the use of admirals.

A New Jersey native, Halsey chose the USS New Jersey to be his flagship. He commanded the Navy's 3rd Fleet in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944, the largest naval battle of World War II and believed by many to be the largest naval battle in history.

Only four officers have ever been promoted to five-star fleet admiral in the history of the Navy. Since Halsey held the title, no other officer has been promoted to that level.

The conning tower's armor was over 17 inches thick, the thickest single piece of armor plate on the entire ship.

The helm, which steered the ship, was located inside the conning tower. The captain could also communicate with crew members in the engine room about the ship's speed.

If the conning tower was damaged or destroyed during battle, there were three other places on board where the ship could be steered from. Contingencies upon contingencies were crucial.

""That's the real genius of this ship, the level of redundancy that they built in,"" Szimanski said. ""Okay, you might be able to shoot through this and knock that out, but we've got four backups or six backups. We've found one system so far that has at least 46 different backups.""

The USS New Jersey measures 11 stories high.

Visible across the Delaware River, the Independence Seaport Museum houses two more historic vessels: the USS Olympia, the oldest steep warship still afloat in the world, and the USS Becuna, a World War II Balao-class submarine.

The museum offers special 90-minute in-depth tours of Turret II, spanning five stories.

The Mark 8 Rangekeeper could calculate where a target would be when the projectile arrived while accounting for factors such as the Earth's rotation, known as the Coriolis effect.

The USS New Jersey has the last Mark 8 Rangekeeper in the world that still works.

""My favorite thing about the computer is in the 1980s, they looked at replacing it with a modern digital computer and they chose not to,"" Szimanski said. ""The modern computer was as accurate, but it wasn't more accurate, so why waste the money? Plus, if we lose power because we've been hit by the enemy, the modern computer dies. This one has a hand crank as a backup. You just pick the lowest-ranking sailor in the room.""

A screen also showed video footage of the guns firing, making it feel even more realistic.

The hallway featured equipment such as oxygen breathing apparatuses and doors leading to fire rooms and engine rooms.

In the fire room, crew members controlled how much fuel was being pumped into the burners by changing the fuel nozzles. This was done every four hours or every time the ship changed speed.

The Navy added air conditioning to the rest of the ship in the 1980s, but there was no point in trying to cool off the boiler room, which could reach temperatures of 120 degrees.

If a torpedo from an enemy ship penetrated the ship's multiple layers of steel — three layers on the bottom and five on the sides — crew members in the fire room could make a quick escape via this four-story ladder.

With a top speed of 35.2 knots, or a little over 40 miles per hour, the USS New Jersey still holds the record for the fastest battleship anywhere in the world because the Navy never built another class of battleship after the Iowa class.

""We are not allowed to run our radar, because if we did, all of the cable TV within 50 miles would go out,"" Szimanski said.

Enlisted crew members were served in buffet-style lines on metal trays, unlike officers who ate on china and silver.

Enlisted crew members could choose between the meal of the day, which would have been entrees like ginger pot roast or steak and lobster, or fast-food-style items such as pizza, hot dogs, and cheeseburgers, which were always available.

They had around 12 minutes to eat their meals. Since the crew was so large, they ate in at least three shifts.

The USS New Jersey usually had two chaplains on board — one Protestant and one Catholic — but the chapel was a non-denominational space that held worship services for other faiths, as well.

The library held around 6,000 books.

Male crew members' hair was not allowed to be any longer than 3 inches.

The ship's washing machines could wash 100 pounds of uniforms per load, and the dryers held 50 pounds each.

The steam presses used auxiliary steam from the ship's boilers to iron uniforms.

In the brig, prisoners received one ration of bread and water per day and had to be escorted to the bathroom by a Marine.

The USS New Jersey carried different aircraft throughout its years of service.

During World War II, it deployed Kingfisher and Seahawk seaplanes to monitor the aim of the 16-inch guns. Helicopters replaced seaplanes in the Korean War, when a Sikorsky HO3S-1 Dragonfly helicopter known as the ""Jersey Bounce"" assisted with search-and-rescue missions. In the 1980s, the Seasprite helicopter was used to detect submarines and deliver supplies.

Why did the Navy phase out battleships? Szimanski said the answer was simple: Battleships have large-caliber guns and thick armor, but neither can withstand the impact of missiles.

However, President Donald Trump has expressed interest in bringing battleships back. At the September all-hands meeting called by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth featuring 800 military leaders, Trump said that he'd spoken to Navy Secretary John Phelan and that it's ""something we're seriously considering.""

""Some people would say, 'No, that's old technology.' I don't know. I don't think it's old technology when you look at those guns,"" Trump said.

In a statement to Business Insider, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said that ""President Trump is prioritizing this vital industry to strengthen our country's economic and national security — including by securing a historic $43 billion shipbuilding investment in the Working Families Tax Cut.""

The Navy referred Business Insider to the Office of the Secretary of War, which did not respond to a request for comment.

Destroyers are equipped with high-range guns and missiles. Long-range strikes are carried out by aircraft carriers. And submarines have filled the role of anti-surface warships. However, there's no vessel that can execute shore bombardment as effectively and efficiently as battleships did with their large artillery.

That's why the USS New Jersey was brought out of retirement again and again after World War II — and why it would still serve as a crucial asset if the need arose.

""If we got into another first-class shooting war, there's a strong chance that they would fire me and bring the ship back,"" Szimanski said. ""There isn't a replacement.""

Update: November 3, 2025 — This story has been updated to include a statement from the White House.

Between billion-dollar investments and global market shocks, partners at Goldman Sachs have no shortage of things to worry about. But two of them share a common nighttime preoccupation.

Business Insider separately asked Meena Lakdawala-Flynn, co-head of Global Private Wealth Management and One Goldman Sachs, and Asahi Pompey, global head of the Office of Corporate Engagement and chair of the Urban Investment Group, what keeps them awake at night.

""I'm always thinking about our people,"" said Lakdawala-Flynn, who has been at the firm for more than 25 years and became a partner in 2014. ""You've built talent, you've invested in talent, they're cultural stewards. To me, it's about retaining people.""

She added that having a ""rotating door"" makes it more difficult to create strong businesses and client solutions. Lakdawala-Flynn manages teams of private wealth advisors, who themselves work with the bank's ultra-high-net-worth clients. As of late last year, Goldman had 39 private wealth management offices around the world.

Pompey, who is nearing two decades at Goldman and became a partner in 2018, also said ""our people.""

""You have the careers of all these individuals in your hands,"" she said. ""Are you doing the very best you can to amplify their talents, give them the opportunities that they need to succeed? I think about that. That keeps me up.""

The firm will, she said, ""ultimately win or lose on the back of the talent that we have and the development of that talent."" Pompey oversees initiatives including 10,000 Small Businesses, 10,000 Women, and One Million Black Women.

Goldman is about to announce its next class of managing directors, who sit one rung below partners in the firm's leadership hierarchy. The bank has come under scrutiny in recent years for an exodus of female leadership and a general lack of women in the most senior positions. Yesterday, CEO David Solomon said Goldman had ""made a bunch of progress, especially in the senior ranks, but candidly not enough, and we continue to be focused on creating opportunities.""

Pompey also said that she still worries about the little things when trying to fall asleep.

""The thought that the more senior you get, you somehow don't sweat the details — I sweat the details about what we're doing, being stewards of the firm's resources, that we're doing it at the highest level for maximum impact, where we should be pivoting or doing things differently,"" she said.

Here's the reality in 2025: you can lose your job with no warning.

I've worked in tech for the past four years, and during that time, I've witnessed thousands of layoffs and reorganizations. I have friends who have been laid off two to three times in a single year.

One day, you're happily employed, the next, you can't log into Slack, your key card no longer works, and you open your personal email to see an email from HR informing you that you're no longer employed.

This week, Amazon announced that it will lay off up to 30,000 employees this year, and 14,000 have been let go already. Whether you were affected by the layoffs at Amazon or you feel your job at another company could be at risk, there are things you can do if you suspect layoffs could be coming your way.

My recommendation is that you make this a standard practice every month or two.

A year from now, it may be hard to remember who that colleague was who told you that you were the best project manager they ever worked with. Keep track of those networks now.

Record the names and contact info of colleagues you've worked with, along with a few notes on how you worked together. Connect on LinkedIn as well.

Should you be laid off, you now have people you can reach out to for references or introductions to opportunities within their networks.

Screenshot a shoutout from an executive and download performance reviews. You can use this to help you think through examples for interviews, and it can even serve as motivation and a reminder of your impact.

You'll want these data points for your résumé and interviews, and saving them along the way will make it much easier than having to hunt them down once you've left your workplace.

Some job applications require you to share a portfolio or samples of your work. You could also be asked to do some sort of project as part of the interview process. Save this info now rather than scrambling to have people send it to you after a layoff.

Many of us use our work emails for work-related accounts, such as LinkedIn. Make sure you add a personal email address as well — this will be helpful for accessing these accounts should you be laid off. Otherwise, you could be locked out.

You can always update these after a layoff, but if you make a habit of updating them regularly, it will be far easier to kick off your job search than if this becomes another task that you have to take on during a time of stress.

If you have already been laid off, give yourself time to grieve and process your emotions. Layoffs are traumatic, and you will need time to recover before starting your job search.

Aside from looking for a new role, there are a few things you should add to your to-do list.

This can take weeks to kick in, so prioritize this as one of your first steps.

Make sure you understand the details of your severance package. There may be requirements to receive your full package, or it may be more beneficial to negotiate some portions.

Many service providers have programs for those who are unemployed — you may be able to get a forbearance on student loans, a pause on car loans or your mortgage, or some relief on your interest rates for a credit card. You never know if you don't ask.

Consider what expenses you can eliminate. Unemployment will not replace your full salary, so cutting back on subscriptions, streaming services, etc., might help your money go further.

Write a post on LinkedIn to share your update with your professional network, and also ensure that your friends and extended community are aware.

Most people probably don't know what you do, but if you share a bit about job titles and industries that are a good match and let them know you're seeking referrals, they may be able to help as well.

Many find that a job search can take more than six months in 2025, so the more you're able to prepare yourself, the better your chances are of navigating that period successfully.

Sgt. 1st Class Johnny Vargas built a booming business on his phone and says he now earns more money online than through the Army.

Vargas never planned to become an influencer. But when a 2023 video of his wife sharing a toddler playtime hack at the beach went viral, he was suddenly thrust into social media stardom. Now Vargas is on a mission to help other service members cash in too.

""I don't care how old or how young you are, what your gender is, or who you pray to or don't pray to,"" he said. ""I always preach, 'You can do this.""

Vargas said that he's paid off debt, started college savings plans for his kids, and boosted his and his wife's retirement funds. Business Insider verified portions of his income through snapshots of monthly earnings and consulting payments.

""It's taken away the fear and anxiety that I previously had with swiping a debit card or swiping a credit card or opening up my bank app,"" he said. His social media success is now opening doors at the highest levels of the Department of Defense.

Vargas has interviewed the secretary of Veterans Affairs and met with the secretary of the Army and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. He's also part of a top-level Army pilot program that partners with soldier-influencers to help the Army recruit more young people online. (That program was recently paused for a legal review.)

This story is the first of a three-part series on the rise of military influencers. If you are serving or have served and want to share your experience with social media and the military, contact this reporter by email at kbaker@insider.com or on Signal at kelseybaker75.75.

Today, he reaches about 25 million views a month on TikTok and Instagram, with more than 270,000 followers across social platforms. Not everyone is a fan, though. Vargas has faced criticism from some who say he profits from his uniform, blurring the line between his military role and personal brand. The Pentagon's rules on that remain murky.

""It can look bad to some people, but social media has changed my life and my family's life financially and career-wise,"" he said. ""It has put me in rooms I never expected to be in.""

Vargas declined to share exactly how much he earns as a creator, but said the new income has transformed his family's finances. Most platforms pay on a scale that can vary drastically depending on reach, content, and audience demographics — a metric known as ""revenue per mile."" Some videos might bring in $30, while others generate several hundred dollars. The best money, Vargas said, comes from consulting.

""Last year, my first full year, I made nearly as much as the Army paid me for the year, and this year I have made well more than my total Army compensation,"" he said.

Vargas has been on active duty for nearly 13 years — most recently as a cavalry scout at Fort Hood, Texas. Social media started as a side hustle, and it now rivals his military career in terms of time commitment, he said. Most soldiers with similar rank, experience, and family size typically earn around $8,000 a month, or nearly $98,000 yearly, according to a government military pay calculator.

He started by posting funny skits and ""top five"" lists before finding a niche in military news. Now, his typical reels stitch together headlines from outlets like Task & Purpose, Stars and Stripes, and Military Times into fast summaries. Vargas' recent posts have highlighted pay changes for troops and potential privatization of military grocery stores. Other videos rib top enlisted leaders for the services. His explainer videos on military peculiarities are especially popular.

Troops are hungry for news about the military, Vargas said. That hunger for information reflects a wider decline in the availability of military-focused journalism. Vargas doesn't view himself as a journalist; he just values good storytelling and raising awareness.

""I just want you to know what happened, and then I want to know what you feel,"" he said. In his reels, Vargas zeroes in on whatever he's ""immediately fired up"" about that could affect troops and their families. He doesn't shy away from negative press about the Army, which has occasionally drawn calls from senior officers.

""You either want to make people learn, make them laugh, or make them cry,"" he said, explaining his tenets for content creation. ""Between those three pillars, I've been able to create this business, but also protect the authenticity of my story and my words.""

He films almost everything on his iPhone using the CapCut app, usually from his truck or home office. Because military guidelines prohibit government employees from receiving compensation tied to their official name, image, and likeness, he typically appears in civilian clothes to draw a line between his military job and personal work.

Vargas aims to post two videos a day, with the exception of Saturday, when engagement tends to dip. Each video takes roughly 90 minutes to produce, between filming, shooting, editing, and uploading. He often records before or after work, and publishes in late morning or evening when his audience, which he described as mostly men under 34 years of age, tends to scroll, he said. He handles almost everything himself, though a remote assistant helps with admin and responding to DMs.

Anyone can do it, he said. ""I'm not the most attractive person, I'm not the funniest person, or the most well-equipped. But that doesn't matter.""

Recently, Vargas branched out into consulting, joining a wave of creators helping companies reach younger consumers. He works with a handful of financial companies and several nonprofits, billing by the hour to help sharpen their messaging. He reached a turning point, he said, when he realized he was no longer ""Johnny,"" but a brand and media company.

The military is still trying to figure out how to treat employee influencers like Vargas who build online audiences while serving on active duty.

Monetization in social media, in particular, is a major gray area for the Army, said Col. Kris Saling, an Army talent management expert who oversees eight influencers, part of a Pentagon program aiming to boost recruitment.

""These guys drive engagement, and they drive positive engagement in a way that we haven't seen, both for recruiting and just for general Army content development,"" she said of the group of influencers. ""And the ROI is one we can't ignore.""

""We can figure something out"" to help keep military influencers in compliance with Pentagon rules, she said. ""We just don't know what that is yet.""

As his following has grown, Vargas has created an LLC, works with a military lawyer to ensure that he operates within the military justice system, and hired a civilian lawyer to help defend everything he's built. He says the work is worth it.

""I would love, more than anything, for every service member to have access to making even an extra, like, $20,000 a year,"" he said. ""I feel like that would change so many lives.""

The Trump administration told a Rhode Island federal judge on Monday that it would tap billions of dollars in contingency funds to pay 50% of the normal amount of SNAP benefits in November as the U.S. government shutdown persists.

SNAP provides food stamps to about 42 million low-income Americans.

The administration in a court filing told Judge Jack McConnell that it had declined the option he suggested to make full November payments for SNAP benefits by using at least $4 billion from the Child Nutrition Program, as well as from other unspecified funds.

Instead, the administration will use all of the $4.65 billion remaining from a contingency fund for SNAP appropriated by Congress for ""November benefits that will be obligated to cover 50% of eligible households' current allotments.""

McConnell, in a ruling on Friday, said the administration could not cease paying SNAP benefits. Before his order, the administration had rejected the idea of using the contingency funds in the face of the shutdown.

It is not clear when the benefits will begin being paid out by individual states.

In its filing Monday, the administration said that the U.S. Department of Agriculture ""will fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds today by generating the table required for States to calculate the benefits available for each eligible household in that State.""

USDA authorized the states to begin disbursing the benefits once the table is issued. 

McConnell, in a written order on Saturday, gave the USDA two options.

One option was to make the full payment of SNAP benefits for November by the end of the day on Monday by using Section 32 Child Nutrition Program funding and other unspecified funds.

The other option was to ""make a partial payment of the total amount of the contingency fund and ... expeditiously resolve the administrative and clerical burdens it described in its papers, but under no circumstances shall the partial payments be made later than Wednesday.""

Patrick Penn, the USDA's deputy undersecretary of the Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, in a separate court filing on Monday, told McConnell that the department had considered using the Child Nutrition Program funds.

But the department determined that those funds ""must remain available to protect full operation of Child Nutrition Programs throughout the fiscal year, instead of being used for SNAP benefits,"" Penn said.

""Section 32 Child Nutrition Program funds are not a contingency fund for SNAP,"" Penn said. ""Using billions of dollars from Child Nutrition for SNAP would leave an unprecedented gap in Child Nutrition funding that Congress has never had to fill with annual appropriations, and USDA cannot predict what Congress will do under these circumstances.""

The Nutrition Program includes school lunch and summer food service programs for children, he noted.

New York Attorney General Letitia James and more than a dozen other state attorneys general are suing the Trump administration over its new rule limiting eligibility for a popular student loan forgiveness program.

The AGs' lawsuit was prompted by the U.S. Department of Education's final rule, released last week, that changes the definition of a ""qualifying employer"" under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The rule excludes certain organizations ""that engage in unlawful activities"" such as ""supporting terrorism and aiding and abetting illegal immigration,"" according to an Education Department statement.

PSLF, signed into law in 2007 by George W. Bush, offers debt cancellation after a decade to borrowers who work for non-profits and the government.

""Public Service Loan Forgiveness was created as a promise to teachers, nurses, firefighters, and social workers that their service to our communities would be honored,"" said Attorney General James in a statement.

""Instead, this administration has created a political loyalty test disguised as a regulation,"" James said.

In an email to CNBC, Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent called the rule ""commonsense reform.""

More than 40 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. Over 9 million borrowers may be eligible for PSLF, according to a 2022 estimate from Protect Borrowers, a nonprofit focused on student loans.

President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness efforts, which included making it easier to qualify for PSLF. Under President Joe Biden, more than 1 million people had their debts cleared under the program, according to a 2024 White House fact sheet.

The lawsuit was brought by attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

A coalition of cities across the U.S, labor unions and nonprofit organizations also filed a lawsuit on Monday against the Trump administration over its PSLF rule.

""The Trump Administration's illegal actions threaten to make higher education even more expensive for Boston's teachers, first responders, and civil servants,"" said Boston Mayor Michelle Wu in a statement.

In this article

OpenAI has signed a deal to buy $38 billion worth of capacity from Amazon Web Services, its first contract with the leader in cloud infrastructure and the latest sign that the $500 billion artificial intelligence startup is no longer reliant on Microsoft.

Under the agreement announced on Monday, OpenAI will immediately begin running workloads on AWS infrastructure, tapping hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) in the U.S., with plans to expand capacity in the coming years.

Amazon stock climbed about 5% following the news.

The first phase of the deal will use existing AWS data centers, and Amazon will eventually build out additional infrastructure for OpenAI.

""It's completely separate capacity that we're putting down,"" said Dave Brown, vice president of compute and machine learning services at AWS, in an interview. ""Some of that capacity is already available, and OpenAI is making use of that.""

OpenAI has been on a dealmaking spree of late, announcing roughly $1.4 trillion worth of buildout agreements with companies including Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle and Google — prompting skeptics to warn of an AI bubble and question whether the country has the power and resources needed to turn the ambitious promises into reality.

Until this year, OpenAI had an exclusive cloud agreement with Microsoft, which first backed the company in 2019 and has invested a total of $13 billion. In January, Microsoft said it would no longer be the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI, and was moving to an arrangement where it would have right of first refusal for new requests.

Last week, Microsoft's preferential status expired under its newly negotiated commercial terms with OpenAI, freeing the ChatGPT creator to partner more widely with the other hyperscalers. Even before that, OpenAI forged cloud deals with Oracle and Google, but AWS is by far the market leader.

""Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in Monday's release. ""Our partnership with AWS strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.""

OpenAI will still be spending heavily with Microsoft, reaffirming that commitment by saying last week that it will purchase an incremental $250 billion of Azure services.

For Amazon, the pact is significant both in the size and scale of the deal itself and because the cloud giant has close ties to OpenAI rival Anthropic. Amazon has invested billions of dollars in Anthropic, and is currently constructing an $11 billion data center campus in New Carlisle, Indiana, that's designed exclusively for Anthropic workloads.

""The breadth and immediate availability of optimized compute demonstrates why AWS is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI's vast AI workloads,"" AWS CEO Matt Garman said in the release.

In its earnings report last week, Amazon reported more than 20% year-over-year revenue growth at AWS, beating analyst estimates. But growth was faster at Microsoft and Google, which reported cloud expansion of 40% and 34%, respectively.

The current agreement with OpenAI is explicitly for use of Nvidia chips, including two popular Blackwell models, but there's potential to incorporate additional silicon down the road. Amazon's custom-built Trainium chip is being used by Anthropic in the new facility.

""We like Trainium because we're able to give customers something that gives them better price performance and honestly gives them choice,"" Brown said, adding that he can't provide any details on ""anything we've done with OpenAI on Trainium at this point.""

The infrastructure will support both inference — such as powering ChatGPT's real-time responses — and training of next-generation frontier models. OpenAI can expand with AWS as needed over the next seven years, but no plans beyond 2026 have been finalized.

OpenAI's foundation models, including so-called open-weight options, are already available on Bedrock, AWS's managed service for accessing leading AI systems.

Companies including Peloton, Thomson Reuters, Comscore, and Triomics use OpenAI models on AWS for tasks ranging from coding and mathematical problem solving to scientific analysis and agentic workflows.

Monday's announcement establishes a more direct relationship.

""As part of this deal, OpenAI is a customer of AWS,"" Brown said. ""They've committed to buying compute capacity from us, and we're charging OpenAI for that capacity. It's very, very straightforward.""

For OpenAI, the most highly valued private AI company, the AWS agreement is another step in getting ready to eventually go public. By diversifying its cloud partners and locking in long-term capacity across providers, OpenAI is signaling both independence and operational maturity.

Altman acknowledged in a recent livestream that an IPO is ""the most likely path"" given OpenAI's capital needs. CFO Sarah Friar has echoed that sentiment, framing the recent corporate restructuring as a necessary step toward going public.

In this article

Kimberly-Clark announced Monday it's struck an agreement to buy Kenvue in a deal valued at $48.7 billion that would create a consumer staples giant.

The deal is a combination of cash and stock and totals about $40 billion on an equity basis, excluding the impact of debt. Shares of Kenvue surged 15% Monday, while Kimberly-Clark stock fell 13%.

The combined company would bring together brands like Huggies and Kleenex with the likes of Band-Aid and Tylenol. It would include 10 billion-dollar brands, the companies said in a news release. The acquisition would be one of the largest on Wall Street this year.

The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026.

Kimberly-Clark Chairman and CEO Mike Hsu said in a statement that the companies share a ""commitment to developing science and technology to provide extraordinary care.""

""Over the last several years, Kimberly-Clark has undertaken a significant transformation to pivot our portfolio to higher-growth, higher-margin businesses while rewiring our organization to work smarter and faster,"" Hsu said. ""We have built the foundation and this transaction is a powerful next step in our journey.""

Kenvue, a portfolio of consumer health brands, spun out of Johnson & Johnson in May 2023, marking the biggest shake-up in J&J's nearly 140-year history. Since then, Kenvue shares have fallen almost 35% from their initial public offering price. As of Friday's close, Kenvue traded at about $14 per share for a market cap of roughly $27 billion.

J&J has sold all of its remaining stake in the consumer goods giant.

The deal comes just weeks after President Donald Trump made unfounded claims linking the use of acetaminophen — the active ingredient in Tylenol — during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism, sending Kenvue's stock sharply lower. The company has staunchly pushed back against his administration's accusation, and many medical experts say Tylenol is often the safest and only option for pain and fever relief in pregnant women.

Acetaminophen is used by upward of 100 million Americans annually.

Kenvue Chair Larry Merlo said in a statement that following a comprehensive strategic review, the board is ""confident this combination represents the best path forward for our shareholders and all other stakeholders.""

Three Kenvue board members will join the Kimberly-Clark board upon the deal's closing. Hsu will continue to serve as chairman and CEO.

The combined company would generate estimated 2025 annual net revenue of roughly $32 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of approximately $7 billion, according to the release.

Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue expect about $1.9 billion in cost synergies from the transaction to be realized in the first three years following the deal's close.

The acquisition comes as Kimberly-Clark and the broader consumer packaged goods industry try to address shifting demand and shopping behavior, often through deal-making and divestitures.

Tariffs imposed by Trump's administration have challenged the industry and its profits as key commodities like pulp, which is used to make tissues and diapers, grow more expensive.

At the beginning of 2025, Kimberly-Clark stopped making private-label diapers for Costco to focus on more premium brands that command higher margins.

In June, the company sold a majority stake in its international tissue business to Brazilian pulp maker Suzano. The resulting joint venture is intended to shield Kimberly-Clark from volatile input costs and help stabilize its margins.

Once the deal closes, Kimberly-Clark will own health-care brands like Sudafed and Pepcid, once again pitting the company against rival Procter & Gamble, which has a health-care division that includes Pepto-Bismol and Vicks.

But even with Kimberly-Clark's blockbuster acquisition, P&G still dwarfs its rival in both enterprise value and annual revenue. P&G has a market cap of about $350 billion.

Similar to Kenvue, other spinoffs have also recently proven to be popular acquisition targets. Last year, candy maker Mars announced plans to buy Kellanova, a snacking-centric spinoff of Kellogg, while Ferrero bought W.K. Kellogg, the cereal stand-alone, this year.

Microsoft said Monday it has secured export licenses to ship Nvidia chips to the United Arab Emirates in a move that could accelerate the Gulf's lofty AI ambitions.

The tech giant said it is the first company under U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to secure such licenses from the Commerce Department and that the approval, granted in September, was based on ""updated and stringent technology safeguards.""

The licenses enable the firm to ship the equivalent of 60,400 additional A100 chips, involving tech darling Nvidia's more advanced GB300 GPUs.

""While the chips are powerful and the numbers are large, more important is their positive impact across the UAE,"" Microsoft said in a blog post. ""We're using these GPUs to provide access to advanced AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source providers, and Microsoft itself.""

Nvidia shares climbed 3% Monday. Microsoft stock rose slightly.

Azad Zangana, head of GCC macroeconomic analysis at Oxford Economics, said in a note that Nvidia's chips are ""crucial"" for the UAE's push to be a major global player in AI.

""Access to the world's leading AI chips provides the hardware that will give developers the leading edge that is needed in an incredibly competitive global landscape,"" Zangana wrote.

There is a ""very important"" relationship between the UAE and U.S. governments that has spanned multiple administrations, Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNBC's Dan Murphy at the ADIPEC conference in Abu Dhabi.

""We're very grateful to the Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and the work that he has championed to enable export licenses to be made available to us,"" Smith said. ""That builds as well on the relationships we had with Secretary [Marco] Rubio when he was in the Senate and Democrats as well. [It] takes two parties to govern, and we keep that in mind.""

Microsoft also announced it will be increasing its investment in UAE, bringing its total contribution to $15.2 billion by the end of this decade.

That includes a $1.5 billion equity investment in AI firm G42 and more than $5.5 billion in capital expenses for the expansion of Microsoft's AI and cloud infrastructure projects in the region.

""We're really investing in trust, and I think it's that combination of technology, talent and trust that you're seeing come together here in the UAE, around AI, around technology, but really the future of the whole economy,"" Smith said.

Shares of Europe's biggest carmakers rose Monday as fears over an industry shortage of semiconductors appeared to recede.

China on Saturday said it would consider some exemptions for Nexperia chip exports. It had previously blocked Nexperia semiconductors from leaving the country after the Dutch government seized control of Nexperia, owned by the Chinese company Wingtech.

The standoff between the Netherlands and China had prompted automotive groups to raise the alarm over a worsening chip shortage.

France's Renault, Germany's Mercedes-Benz Group and Milan-listed shares of Jeep maker Stellantis were all trading up around 3% on Monday morning.

Auto parts suppliers Valeo and Aumovio had advanced 3% and 1.6%, respectively, by around 11:30 a.m. London time (6:30 a.m. ET).

Germany's Volkswagen, Porsche and BMW were also trading more than 1.3% higher.

Analysts at Barclays said developments over the weekend appeared to be ""quite positive"" for the automotive sector, with fears of significant disruption likely to be avoided.

""While the Nexperia issue is not fully resolved, with ongoing negotiations between the Dutch and Chinese government to determine a path forward for Nexperia, we believe the potential near-term production headwind has been remediated, although we await more details,"" Dan Levy, senior autos analyst at Barclays, said in a research note published Monday.

The situation involving Nexperia began in September, when the Dutch government took control of the company, in what was seen as a highly unusual move, reportedly after the U.S. raised security concerns.

In making the decision, the Dutch government cited fears that technology from the company — which specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries — ""would become unavailable in an emergency.""

China responded by blocking exports of the firm's finished products.

German automakers are thought to be especially sensitive to Nexperia-related disruptions because they rely heavily on large, domestic suppliers, known as ""Tier 1s,"" and local production facilities and companies, such as Nexperia, despite much of its manufacturing moving to China.

Japan's Honda Motor became the first known automaker to reduce production due to the problem last week.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Bill Winters, CEO of Standard Chartered, foresees a future in which nearly all global transactions are conducted on a digital blockchain ledger, he told a crowd in Hong Kong on Monday, as crypto adoption amongst mainstream banking and finance institutions grows. 

""Our belief, which I think is shared by the leadership of Hong Kong, is that pretty much all transactions will settle on blockchains eventually, and that all money will be digital,"" the UK-based multinational bank's CEO said during a panel at Hong Kong FinTech Week. 

""Think about what that means: a complete rewiring of the financial system,"" he said, adding that experimentation is required to determine what that rewiring looks like. 

Standard Chartered — which is listed in both London and Hong Kong — has been ramping up its involvement with digital assets in recent years, including through digital asset custody services, trading platforms, and tokenized products. 

Winters made the comments while discussing Hong Kong's role in the global digital assets space, crediting the city for leadership on experimentation and regulation, alongside Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan. 

Hong Kong has been working to establish itself as a regional crypto hub through a digital asset licensing regime, as well as tokenization pilots in which Standard Chartered is a participant.

A tokenized asset is a digital representation of a real-world asset, like stocks, bonds, or commodities, that can be recorded and traded on a blockchain or distributed ledger. Stablecoins, which are pegged to a currency, are often held up as an early example of a tradable tokenized asset.

Standard Chartered, in partnership with blockchain venture capital firm Animoca Brands and telecommunications company HKT, is planning to launch a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin under a new regulatory framework the city launched in August.

Winters said Monday he believed that Hong Kong dollar stablecoins can represent an interesting new medium of exchange for international trade on digital terms.

Other global fintech leaders have also made bullish predictions for tokenized assets in recent months.

Robinhood Markets CEO Vlad Tenev said last month that tokenization was a ""freight train,"" coming to most major markets in the next five years.

Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, said in April that every asset from stocks to bonds to real estate can be tokenized in what will represent a ""revolution"" for investing.

In this article

The emergence of critical minerals as a new arena of geopolitical competition has coincided with a dizzying rally in U.S.-listed rare earths mining stocks.

Despite paring gains in recent weeks, shares of Critical Metals have advanced 241% over the last three months, while NioCorp Developments, Energy Fuels and Idaho Strategic Resources have all surged well above 100% over the same period.

The eye-watering gains are even more remarkable year-to-date. Energy Fuels' stock price has quadrupled through the first 10 months of the year, while NioCorp Developments' shares have nearly quintupled.

Rare earths have come to the fore as a key bargaining chip in the ongoing geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies.

Tony Sage, CEO of Critical Metals, which has one of the world's largest rare earths deposits in southern Greenland, described the rally of U.S.-listed rare earths miners as evidence of a major market boom.

""I talk of it like this, I mean, there have been four big booms. You had the gold boom in the 19th century, the oil boom in the 20th century, in the early 21st century you had the tech boom — and now you've got the rare earths boom,"" Sage told CNBC by telephone.

""But the rare earths boom is the future. It will power all of the above.""

Rare earths refer to 17 elements on the periodic table that have an atomic structure that gives them special magnetic properties. These materials are vital components to a vast array of modern technologies, from everyday electronics, such as smartphones, to electric vehicles and military equipment.

China, which has a near-monopoly on rare earths, recently threatened to expand its export controls on the elements to further leverage its dominance of the supply chain. However, following an in-person meeting in South Korea on Thursday between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Beijing agreed to delay the Oct. 9 export controls by one year.

U.S.-listed rare earths stocks rallied on the news, although analysts remain skeptical about whether the apparent trade truce can offer long-term relief.

""As in all booms, there were a lot of oil companies that couldn't find oil and there were a lot of gold companies that couldn't find gold. And I'm sure there are going to be a lot of rare earths companies that won't make it either — because when there's a boom, there's hype. And when there's hype, there's overexuberance in investing,"" Critical Metals' Sage said.

""It's not a straight rise up. It's a jagged line, but the trend is in the right direction if you've got the right project in the right place, and you've got the right partners,"" he added.

Kevin Das, senior technical consultant at New Frontier Minerals, an Australian-based rare earths explorer, agreed with Sage's description of a rare earths market boom, while acknowledging the likelihood of stock price pullbacks.

""People are saying we're in an uptrend on what is a bigger supercycle and some of the evidence behind that is there has been low commodity prices for some time, there's been underinvestment. And now, with the advent of AI ... we're going to see a much bigger and longer supercycle,"" Das told CNBC by telephone.

Das drew parallels between the Biden administration's support of clean energy projects, which coincided with a rally in lithium-related stocks, and the Trump administration's backing of rare earths.

""In the last nine to 10 months that Trump has been in power, he's talked about annexing Greenland, he's talked about doing a deal with Ukraine for rare earths and then the real clincher was this equity deal with MP Materials,"" Das said.

""So, I think the runway over the next two to three years is going to be very fruitful,"" he added.

Not everyone is as bullish on the outlook for rare earths-related stocks, however.

Audun Martinsen, head of supply chain research at Rystad Energy, said the recent surge in equity prices reflected a mix of geopolitical tension, strategic policy support and speculative momentum.

""Rare earths have clearly moved to the center of global industrial strategy, vital for defense, EVs and clean energy, but this looks more like the early stages of a structural shift than a mature 'fourth boom,'"" Martinsen told CNBC by email.

""We are going from a philosophy of 'fill the gap' through imports to 'mine the gap' domestically or regionally,"" he continued. ""It will be a lengthy, expensive and rocky path forward as adequate, cost-effective resources and element diversity are complex to get full control over.""

Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia University, said there were two clear factors at work as global competition intensifies to secure the supply of critical minerals — one structural and the other political.

""The structural: Despite whatever political attempts there may be to stop or derail things, the clean-energy transition is happening — and it is accelerating — and yes, it depends on a number of critical minerals, whose prices are bound to jump,"" Wagner told CNBC by email.

China, for instance, is the low-cost supplier of many of these minerals, Wagner said, noting that the Asian giant's mineral dominance is by no means an accident.

""Beijing has invested heavily in green industrial policy for years, focusing on the full, integrated supply chain. That's where politics enters,"" Wagner said.

""Some attempts to onshore supply chains are eminently justified for national security and other reasons, and those attempts will increase prices and stocks of U.S. mining companies. Some of what we see, of course, is merely the current politics or erratic trade wars and the like,"" he added.

On-chain metrics spotlight bitcoin price support at $113K via STH Realized Price, projecting MVRV-driven surges to $160K–$200K by late 2025 in the bull cycle's next explosive phase. 

The bitcoin price is at a very interesting point in its current market cycle. With lots of different opinions and not much movement in price, it's hard to know what's coming next. But when we look at the important data, things get a lot clearer. These signals don't just tell us what might happen in the immediate future, but can clarify what the coming weeks and months could bring.

We begin with the Short-Term Holder Realized Price, effectively the average cost basis for new market participants. This level has historically acted as a dynamic zone of support and resistance throughout each cycle. At present, the STH realized price sits around $113,000, close to where Bitcoin is currently trading. Despite the sharp liquidation event earlier this month, the market has rebounded and stabilized around this level.

When Bitcoin holds above the short-term holder realized price, it signals that the average recent buyer is either at breakeven or in slight profit. This often increases investor confidence and encourages additional capital rotation into the market. In past cycles, such as in 2017, every retest of this line provided an ideal accumulation opportunity before the next leg higher. Maintaining support above this could once again mark the foundation for the next phase of the bull cycle.

Beyond the realized price itself, we turn to the Short-Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio, which measures the relationship between Bitcoin's current market price and its aggregate realized price. This ratio helps identify over- or undervalued conditions.

Across prior cycles, clear patterns emerge, with Bitcoin consistently finding support around the 0.66 level during large down moves, prime zones for accumulation. On the upside, notable resistance has historically appeared around 1.33, 1.43, and 1.64, corresponding to profit-taking points where new participants reach 33%, 43%, or 64% unrealized gains, respectively.

Using these multiples, we can estimate future targets. By multiplying the current STH Realized Price at ~$113,000 by these MVRV thresholds, we can project potential resistance zones for this cycle. The 1.33 zone generates a projected price of approximately $160,000 for the end of the year. The midway 1.43 zone equates to a projection of ~$170,000, and the upper zone of 1.64 extrapolates to around $200,00. These levels align remarkably well with historical resistance zones, suggesting the $160k–$200k range could act as a major price ceiling if Bitcoin continues to hold above its realized base.

Next, we turn to the Long-Term Holder MVRV Ratio, which measures unrealized profit and loss among the market's most experienced investors. This cohort's behavior provides key insights into macrocycle dynamics. In the 2017 bull run, LTH MVRV peaked at 36.2. In the 2021 cycle, it peaked at 12.58, roughly a 2.9x reduction, demonstrating the diminishing return structure that has defined Bitcoin's maturation.

Applying that same diminishing factor (÷2.88) suggests a potential peak around 4.37 for this current cycle. Given that the Long-Term Holder Realized Price sits near $37,400, a 4.37x multiple implies a potential target of roughly $163,000–$165,000, overlapping with the upper targets derived from short-term holder data and levels we've already reached this cycle in LTH MVRV terms.

As the Bitcoin market evolves, traditional MVRV metrics must also adapt. One of the most effective approaches is to view these ratios on a rolling basis, which accounts for dynamic changes in market conditions.

When modeled on a 2-Year Rolling basis, the MVRV Z-Score eliminates some of the “diminishing peaks” seen in static models. Peaks around 3.0 and troughs near –1.0 have consistently aligned with market tops and bottoms. Intriguingly, current readings are closer to the buy zone than the sell zone, implying that Bitcoin is still in an accumulation-friendly range.

To gain more granularity, we can also assess the MVRV ratio on a 100-day rolling basis, which captures intra-cycle fluctuations. In this model, spikes above +2 correlate with local tops, while dips below –2 align with local bottoms and optimal DCA zones. Across Bitcoin's entire history, this rolling 100-day MVRV framework has identified some of the most accurate short-term accumulation and distribution points, even within broader cycle trends.

Even as Bitcoin's market matures and institutional involvement deepens, these core on-chain valuation frameworks remain among the most powerful tools for cycle analysis. The realized price models, particularly those tied to specific cohorts, provide insight into market conviction, showing when participants are in profit and when behavioral shifts are likely to trigger the next move. More importantly, adapting traditional metrics to rolling frameworks ensures our models evolve alongside Bitcoin itself, capturing new investor behavior, liquidity cycles, and the growing institutional influence that defines this market's future.

If Bitcoin can continue holding above the STH realized price, the data suggests there is ample room to the upside, with plausible cycle targets in the $160,000–$200,000 region.

The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) pumped $29.4 billion into the banking system on Friday, sparking optimism on crypto social media. While the move aimed at easing liquidity concerns and is supportive of risk assets, including bitcoin, it's nothing out of the ordinary.

The Fed pumped billions through overnight repo operations, the largest since the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, to ease liquidity stress that has supposedly capped bitcoin's BTC$107,369.54 gains in recent weeks.

The operation, conducted via the standing repo facility (SRF), temporarily boosted cash available with primary dealers and banks and aimed at adding short-term liquidity into the system, lowering repo rates back toward normal levels, preventing a sudden freeze in short-term funding markets, and giving banks breathing room to manage reserves while the Fed monitors the situation.

All this sounds too technical, so let's break it down to understand how the repo, bank reserves, and the Fed's latest action are related.

The repo, or repurchase agreement, is a short-term loan made overnight between two parties — one with idle cash in a bank deposit who wants to generate yield from it, and the other party looking for a cash loan against valuable collateral, such as U.S. Treasury securities and bills.

The two parties agree on an interest rate, and the cash is loaned overnight with the promise to buy back the asset on the following day. The lenders in these transactions are typically large money managers, such as money market funds.

The repo deals affect the bank's reserves. As the lender transfers cash to the borrower, the reserves at the lender's bank decrease, while those at the borrower's bank increase. An individual bank is vulnerable to strain if many of its accounts lend money to borrowers at other banks.

Banks need sufficient reserves to meet regulatory requirements and conduct their daily operations, so they may borrow reserves themselves or adjust their balance sheets as required. And when facing a shortage, they tap the repo market or other Fed facilities such as the discount window or the Supplementary Financing Rate (SFR).

However, when reserve shortages become severe across the system, it pushes up repo rates as lendable cash becomes scarce, and more borrowers compete for less cash, causing liquidity to tighten.

This is where the Fed steps in, and that's precisely what it did on Oct. 31. The giant liquidity injection through the SRF, a tool put in place to provide fast loans collateralized with Treasury or mortgage bonds, happened as bank reserves slipped to $2.8 trillion, lifting repo rates.

Lendable cash had become scarce, reportedly due to the balance sheet runoff, referred to as quantitative tightening (QT), and the Treasury's decision to bulk up its checking account at the Fed, known as the Treasury General Account (TGA). Both withdrew cash from the system.

The $29 billion liquidity boost effectively counteracts the tightening by temporarily expanding bank reserves, lowering short-term rates, and easing borrowing pressures.

The move helps avoid potential liquidity crises that could damage financial markets, which is ultimately supportive of risk assets like bitcoin, which are considered pure plays on fiat liquidity.

That said, what the Fed did on Friday does not amount to or suggest an impending quantitative easing (QE), which involves direct asset purchases by the Fed, expanding its balance to increase the overall level of liquidity in the system over months or years.

The Fed's action on Friday represents a reversible, short-term liquidity tool and may not necessarily be as stimulative to risk assets as the QE.

Moreover, as Andy Constan, CEO and CIO of Damped Spring Advisors, said on X, the whole thing will work out by itself. 

""If and only if system wide reserves are indeed suddenly scarce more aggressive action by the Fed would be needed. What's happening is a little interbank rebalance and a little credit stress and a little system tightens for TGA. It will all work itself out fine,"" Constan said on X. 

""If it doesn't the rates will have to stay elevated and and escalate and SRF will have to grow rapidly. Before that it's mostly worth ignoring,"" Constan added.

Oops, something went wrong

Microsoft's (MSFT) nearly $10 billion deal with former bitcoin miner IREN (IREN) for data center capacity underscores how the crypto mining industry's pivot to artificial intelligence is paying off.

The Australia-based company said Monday that it struck a $9.7 billion deal, making Microsoft its largest customer. Under the five-year agreement, the so-called neocloud operator, which specializes in data centers for AI workloads, will provide Microsoft access to Nvidia (NVDA) chips at its facility in Childress, Texas.

IREN stock jumped as much as 10% on Monday. Share are up about 580% so far this year.

Separately, IREN also partnered with Dell (DELL) to purchase processors and related equipment for roughly $5.8 billion.

The deal underscores an industry pivot as bitcoin miners have evolved into central players in the AI boom, signing long-term contracts to leverage their land, energy, and data centers for artificial intelligence workloads.

Riot (RIOT), TeraWulf (WULF), and Cipher Miner (CIFR) are just a handful of miners that have shifted their resources toward high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure and AI, sending their stocks soaring nearly 100%, 160%, and 360%, respectively, this year.

""Bitcoin miners are now an integral part of the AI value chain, providing warm powered shells for AI data centers - considered the biggest bottleneck to execution,"" Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani and his team wrote on Monday morning.

""As we write this, every U.S. listed Bitcoin miner has pivoted towards optimizing value of their power assets over maximizing Bitcoin upside,"" Chhugani wrote.

A crowded mining field and bitcoin's price swings have squeezed profit margins, while bitcoin's four-year ""halving"" event, which cuts mining rewards in half, has further eroded revenue over time.

IREN, formally known as Iris Energy, said earlier this year it would stop expanding its bitcoin mining operations to prioritize its AI cloud and data center business.

Bernstein has a Buy rating on the stock with a $75 price target.

""As IREN continues to scale its AI business, we believe it still leaves room for multiple expansion,"" the note said.

Bitcoin BTC$107,369.54 miners are now an integral part of the artificial intelligence (AI) value chain, Wall Street broker Bernstein said in a note Monday updating its model for the sector. 

The broker argued that miners' large-scale power infrastructure and facilities have become critical to AI data centers, now seen as the biggest execution bottleneck for the fast-growing industry.

Every U.S.-listed bitcoin miner the broker covers has pivoted toward maximizing the value of its power assets rather than betting on bitcoin price upside, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

The firm's analysts abandoned their discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology in favor of a sum-of-parts valuation, combining miners' bitcoin holdings, mining EBITDA, AI co-location and cloud revenues, and the potential value of power sites earmarked for AI data centers—using a conservative $3 million per megawatt (MW) multiple.

Bernstein lifted its price target for Core Scientific (CORZ) to $24 from $17, citing the company's pivot toward high-performance computing (HPC) colocation and its plan to deliver about 590 megawatts of IT load by early 2027. 

The report noted that shareholders' rejection of the CoreWeave deal gives management more room to optimize value and hinted at a new partnership expected in the fourth quarter.

Riot Platforms (RIOT) also saw its target raised to $25 from $19, reflecting the AI potential of its 1-gigawatt Corsicana site. while CleanSpark (CLSK) was lifted to $24 from $20 as it moves toward a hybrid bitcoin-AI model through new hires and partnerships. 

Bernstein rates IREN, CORZ, RIOT, and CLSK outperform, the broker said bitcoin miners with active or potential AI contracts are being re-rated by the market as key enablers of the next generation of computing infrastructure.

Mining stocks were flying in premarket trading following news of IREN's AI cloud deal with Microsoft.

IREN was 21% higher in early trade, around $60.75. Core Scientific shares were 6.8% higher at $23. Riot stock was 3% higher at $20.38. CleanSpark rose 3.6% to $18.44.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum's ecosystem continues to draw attention as stablecoins on its blockchain reach approximately $165 billion in reserves, positioning it among the world's largest. 

However, ETH's spot price has softened, dropping below $4,000, reflecting cautious investor sentiment. Market participants are closely watching institutional positioning and on-chain metrics. They want to see if Ethereum's role as a macro-scale digital reserve can drive renewed price momentum soon.

Stablecoins issued on the Ethereum blockchain have now aggregated around $165 billion in reserves, ranking roughly 22nd among global foreign-exchange holdings. This exceeds some national reserve pools, including Singapore and India, underscoring Ethereum's evolving role beyond a decentralized smart-contract platform.

Analysts say the development shows structural maturation of the Ethereum ecosystem. Stablecoins are increasingly used as collateral, settlement assets, or digital reserve instruments rather than purely speculative tokens.

“When you really look at this and realize how much $ETH is integrated into stablecoins, you have to be bullish. According to the data, $ETH stablecoins rank among the 20 largest FX reserves, just behind the US,” a crypto investor, BigBob, noted on X.

The reserve accumulation illustrates growing confidence in Ethereum's underlying infrastructure as a foundational component of digital finance.

On-chain data and trading activity indicate that institutional participants and large traders strategically positioned for potential ETH rebounds. Long positions have increased, reflecting investor interest in spot exposure and stablecoin-linked liquidity. For example, specific whale wallets hold roughly 39,000 ETH ($150 million) as long-term positions, signaling significant accumulation by major market participants.

Market observers note that these trends resemble traditional reserve asset behavior, highlighting Ethereum's potential as a macro-level instrument for capital allocation. Investor confidence is growing, but execution remains critical. Tokenomics, staking yields, regulatory clarity, and network performance will determine whether Ethereum can sustain its reserve-level narrative.

In the derivatives market, funding rates have recently turned negative, suggesting a balance between long and short positions and indicating potential for short-term price squeezes. This dynamic, combined with institutional inflows and stablecoin issuance, will likely shape ETH's trajectory in the coming weeks and months.

Amid these developments, Ethereum's spot price has shown weakness. On October 29, ETH fell below US$4,000; at the time of writing, it stood at $3,912.90. The market appears to be waiting for confirmation of macro narratives, including continued stablecoin flows and increased network activity, before accelerating upward.

Investors remain cautious, with price consolidation reflecting both short-term profit-taking and broader market sentiment. While on-chain metrics suggest accumulation is ongoing, further catalysts—such as institutional inflows or regulatory clarity—may be required to restore upward momentum. Analysts note that if Ethereum continues to prove real-world utility and stablecoin integration, it could reinforce its role as a digital reserve. This may support a price recovery toward $4,200–4,500 in the medium term.

Ethereum's stablecoin ecosystem exploded in October, hitting a new all-time high in monthly transaction volume with traders rotating into stable assets and yield strategies as the broader crypto market spiraled into uncertainty.

According to The Block's data, stablecoin volume on Ethereum reached $2.82 trillion, marking a 45% jump from September's $1.94 trillion. This surge surpasses all previous monthly highs, driven foremost by USDC ($1.62 trillion) and USDT ($895.5 billion), both of which saw recorded massive growth.

On the other hand, MakerDAO's DAI was ranked third at $136 billion, slightly down from September but far below its May peak of $470.7 billion.

Stablecoin issuers are the largest revenue generators across the crypto ecosystem. Throughout October, they contributed between 65% and 70% of total daily protocol revenue, surpassing lending platforms, DEXs, and blockchain infrastructure protocols.

According to DefiLlama, the total DEX volume hit $613.3 billion in October, up from nearly $500 billion in September. Uniswap remained the clear leader, processing $170.9 billion, followed by PancakeSwap at $101.9 billion.

The DEX-to-CEX volume ratio climbed to 19.84%, indicating a preference for decentralized platforms. Meanwhile, CEXs recorded their highest volume since January 2025, totaling $2.17 trillion, a 28% monthly increase.

Binance dominated with $810.4 billion in volume, trailed by Gate ($175.6 billion), Bybit ($156.9 billion), and Bitget ($134.7 billion).

Ethereum's network fundamentals turned dull as CryptoQuant reported a 24% decline in daily active addresses, from around 480,000 in mid-August to 363,000 by late October.

The MVRV ratio, a key valuation metric, has also dropped from 1.85 to 1.50, further indicating that investors' profit margins are shrinking and that the market is entering a cooling, neutral phase.

CryptoQuant analysts added that Ethereum's Realized Price sits at $2,560, placing the market in a neutral zone between fear and greed. Historically, MVRV readings near 1.5 have preceded strong volatility.

According to CoinMarketCap, Ethereum is currently consolidating around $3,700, down 17% in the past month and 5.5% in the last 24 hours. Analysts claim that price stability above the $3,840 support could trigger a rebound toward $4,200–$4,500, while failure to hold this zone may push ETH down to $3,560–$3,200.

Oops, something went wrong

Publicly traded Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) added more than $294 million in ETH in the last week, as its Chairman Tom Lee remained bullish on a year-end run for Bitcoin and Ethereum, even as the company's share price has fallen in recent weeks.

The firm acquired another 82,353 ETH, bringing its balance sheet totals to 3,395,422 Ethereum or more than 2.8% of the circulating Ethereum supply which it has acquired at an average price of $3,909.

With ETH changing hands at $3,617, down more than 6% over the past 24 hours, the firm's investment has declined. BMNR shares were off more than 8% on Monday and have fallen about 25% over the past month.

 Still, Lee is predicting an end-of-year rally.

“The market is consolidating,” said Lee on CNBC's Squawk Box. “But if I look at fundamentals, like Ethereum, stablecoin volume has been exploding, application revenues are at all-time highs…right now fundamentals are leading price in crypto.” 

Lee pointed to crypto's recent record-breaking $19 billion liquidation event as a reset point for the market, calling it a ""miniature rupture” around which the market is consolidating. 

“I think eventually we consolidate, and rally into year end,” he said, calling a potential move to $150,000 or $200,000 for Bitcoin and $7,000 for Ethereum before the calendar turns. 

An explosive move up for ETH would significantly boost BitMine's industry leading Ethereum treasury. At the time of writing, the firm holds more than $12.5 billion worth of ETH, making it the second largest crypto treasury, only trailing Bitcoin behemoth and digital asset treasury pioneer, Strategy, which holds more than $69 billion worth of Bitcoin.

The firm also holds 192 Bitcoin worth around $20 million, a $62 million stake in EightCo Holdings (ORBS), and around $389 million in unencumbered cash.

It's a small move with a big message: this project is built for real growth, not quick exits.

A good liquidity lock means:

Quick Facts:

1️⃣ Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley believes that within the next 12 months, every Wall Street institution will be involved in crypto.

2️⃣ Massive inflows into products like Bitwise's Solana ETF and moves by giants like JP Morgan and BlackRock prove the shift is already underway.

3️⃣ The best altcoins to buy now include $HYPER, $PEPENODE, and $BAN – all poised to ride the next big wave.

Crypto is hosting the wildest party in town, there is no doubt about it.

Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley recently took to X to claim that within the next 12 months, every Wall Street institution will be doing something in crypto.

‘Software is eating the world. Crypto is going to eat capital markets' – Hunter Horsley

Almost every major bank, from Bank of America and BlackRock to Goldman Sachs and HSBC, is knee-deep in one or more crypto-related endeavors, whether that's crypto trading and custody, crypto ETPs, crypto-enabled payments, or tokenization.

Is Horsley's claim a bold one? Sure. Especially considering that DeFi currently represents less than half a percent of traditional finance's scope.

That said, it's worth noting that these crypto-related investment products are still relatively new, and it's only fair to give them time to mature rather than immediately comparing them to TradFi.

If anything, the massive interest in these new products – ETFs being a great example – shows that the sky is the limit for crypto.

That's a clear sign the market is hungry for new-age investment products that give it exposure to high-quality cryptos.

What's more, a recent Bloomberg report revealed that JP Morgan is all set to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum as loan collateral.

This would offer billion-dollar investment parties more flexible financing options, allowing them to retain their crypto holdings and avoid triggering taxable events.

And then there's BlackRock, one of the biggest asset-management companies in the world, which now boasts over $87B in Bitcoin ETF assets and more than $10B in Ether ETFs – proving that crypto is indeed the next big investment opportunity.

Don't want to miss the crypto gold rush? Ready to ride Wall Street's smarts? Below are three top altcoins to buy right now.

One of the best crypto presales of 2025, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has already raised an eye-popping $25.6M+ from early investors. And it's worth the hype.

That's because $HYPER plans to bring Solana-like speeds, low costs, and Web3 compatibility to the Bitcoin blockchain, which has so far been technologically sidelined compared to Ethereum and Solana.

It'll also enable developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts directly on Bitcoin.

So, get ready to access DeFi trading apps, DAOs, governance, lending, staking, and gaming on Bitcoin, all thanks to Bitcoin Hyper.



Furthermore, a decentralized canonical bridge will facilitate seamless interaction between Bitcoin's Layer-1 and Hyper's Layer-2 networks. Simply put, it'll convert your original Bitcoin into wrapped, Layer 2-compatible tokens.

Here's the kicker: if you want to join the Bitcoin Web3 revolution, now's the best time to get in. The project is currently in presale, meaning right now you can buy Bitcoin Hyper for just $0.013215 each – and stake it for 46% APY. Check out our guide to buying $HYPER to find out how.

And holding onto your tokens until 2026 could earn you a handsome 1,400% ROI, with the token projected to potentially reach $0.20 according to our $HYPER price prediction.

To fully understand PEPENODE ($PEPENODE)'s ground-breaking potential to become the next crypto to explode, consider how it aims to revolutionize the crypto mining segment.

Right now, traditional crypto mining is not only super expensive – with high GPU, electricity, and maintenance costs – but also highly technical, requiring detailed knowledge to set up and operate.

First, PEPENODE is extremely affordable, as your only starting cost is the price of your first $PEPENODE token, which, during its current presale, is just $0.0011317 per token.

Second, mining on PEPENODE is set to be simple yet engaging. The only challenge lies in experimenting with different combinations of mining nodes, as each will have unique characteristics and compatibilities.



Despite being virtual, the mining setup will feel just like the real thing. The dashboard will include familiar elements such as hashrate and other key performance metrics.

Interested? Check out our step-by-step guide on how to buy $PEPENODE.

And according to our $PEPENODE price prediction, if you catch the trend early and get in now, you could potentially see a 542% ROI by the end of 2026.

Comedian ($BAN) launched in October last year and rode the Q4 boom to shoot up over 3,000% in less than a month.

It's a viral meme coin inspired by the controversial art piece by Maurizio Cattelan, which features nothing more than a banana taped to a wall.

This artwork sparked an ongoing debate about modern art vs. contemporary art and whether modern art is borderline stupid, fueling massive investor interest in the $BAN token.

Nearly 12 months later, the token now appears ready for another major rally. It's currently finding support on a key upward-sloping trendline – the same one that triggered a 1,000% rally back in March this year.

However, with a strong resistance line overhead, its upside potential will depend on whether it can successfully break past that resistance.

That said, even from current levels up to that resistance line, there's at least a 50% gain on offer.

But if $BAN manages to break beyond that line – which is highly likely given that it has tested it four times already (and as we know, the more times a resistance is tested, the weaker it gets) – then we could see another 2024-style rally.

Join the meme coin mania – buy $BAN on MEXC today.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Sui ($SUI) Down 13.1%, Solana ($SOL) Down 7.1%: Digitap ($TAP) is the Only Altcoin Thriving","https://ambcrypto.com/sui-sui-down-13-1-solana-sol-down-7-1-digitap-tap-is-the-only-altcoin-thriving/","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 17:04:06 GMT","

As major altcoins cool off, traders are hunting for strength. This week's tape shows it clearly: Sui (SUI) is sliding double-digits and Solana (SOL) is weakening, while Digitap ($TAP) is pressing higher inside its live presale. The difference isn't just price, it's product. 

With the Digitap app live on the Apple App Store and Google Play, capital is rotating from chart-led narratives toward traction-led fintech. If you're watching SUI and SOL, you should be looking at $TAP, the crypto presale, which is already up by 114% from its initial price.





Over the past week, SUI has dropped 13.28%, sliding from around $2.65 to $2.30. The steady string of red candles highlights firm bearish momentum, with the chart now printing lower highs and lower lows. 



Solana has also softened, down roughly 7.1% to about $189, as technical indicators signal more short-term pressure.

Both tokens seem under pressure as trading volumes ease and investors take profits after months of strong gains. It looks like traders are moving away from these overextended major tokens and shifting their focus toward newer opportunities with higher potential upside.

The Linear Regression Curve (LRC) overlay on Solana's chart confirms a weakening trend, showing price drifting beneath the regression midline, a technical sign that momentum is softening and sellers are regaining control.

While these top-tier altcoins cool off, one project is defying gravity — Digitap, a fintech token blending crypto with real-world financial services, is surging ahead.

Digitap, a revolutionary unified money app blending crypto and fiat, is proving that real-world traction can move markets just as quickly as technical indicators. The project's presale momentum now coincides with a tangible milestone: the Digitap App going fully live on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.



This achievement, rarely seen before a token launch, has shifted investor perception of Digitap from a speculative presale to an operational fintech platform. Unlike typical crypto startups, Digitap's ecosystem allows users to hold, spend, and transfer both fiat and digital currencies seamlessly, with an integrated Visa crypto card on the way.

Such milestones are typically reached after a token's launch, yet Digitap has already delivered, positioning $TAP as the best crypto to buy now for investors seeking tangible utility. This fusion of live fintech adoption and blockchain innovation gives $TAP a credibility edge over purely narrative-driven altcoins.

Analysts are turning their attention to $TAP as its presale momentum and early fintech adoption suggest the kind of ground-floor entry that could underpin the project's ambitious goals.

USE THE CODE “LIVEAPP30” FOR 30% OFF FIRST-TIME PURCHASES

Digitap's ongoing presale continues to attract strong investor momentum. The $TAP token's initial price was $0.0125, gradually increasing to its current level of $0.0268, a rise of approximately 114% for the earliest investors. With the launch price set at $0.14, new investors still have the potential to achieve an impressive 422% return once it goes live.

Other notable figures from Digitap's presale include nearly 90 million tokens sold and approximately $1.34 million raised, a remarkable achievement for such an early stage. This success has clearly drawn attention, as the current stage (which opened only a few days ago) is already 62% sold out.

The next scheduled price increase to $0.0297 represents a further 10.8% rise, supporting the structured growth model that has defined the presale so far. With the current presale round already more than halfway sold, Digitap's phased approach has established a clear upward trajectory in both price and investor engagement.

While Sui and Solana consolidate amid investor fatigue, Digitap is capturing early momentum through functional utility, growing liquidity, and verified app adoption. SUI's 13% drawdown and SOL's 7% dip highlight a broader correction phase across Layer-1 ecosystems, whereas $TAP's presale rise of 114% suggests the beginning of a sustained upward trajectory.

As 2026 approaches, Digitap's combination of live fintech operations and transparent tokenomics could position it among the top altcoins to buy before listing, outperforming speculative projects struggling to deliver.

She has enjoyed tenure at brands such as Ankr and Kiraverse (Immutable), and has also curated and hosted landmark industry events such as Cryptospace (2017), CryptoRunway (Art Basel 2021), and the Gam3rs' Choice Awards (2023).
		



“I'm very excited to speak at the upcoming Blockchain Futurist Conference in Miami, and continue Naoris' active schedule on the blockchain conference circuit,” said Maria Lobanova, the CMO at Naoris Protocol. “The Blockchain Futurist Conference is an ideal platform for us to show how cybersecurity underpins the next generation of finance, from tokenised assets to derivatives, and why banks, funds and ecosystems must build on a unified foundation to realise Web3's potential.”

Naoris Protocol leadership recently attended the Milken Institute Global Investors' Symposium in Mexico City, which brought together senior executives, policymakers and investors, providing a unique platform for Naoris to showcase its quantum-resilient infrastructure, and engage with institutional investors and strategic partners exploring emerging digital asset classes and cybersecurity in the tokenised economy.

Naoris also recently announced the launch of Naoris Ventures, a dedicated venture arm driving the adoption of decentralized, post-quantum security infrastructure across critical global systems. Naoris Ventures will accelerate initiatives that strengthen resilience, trust, and efficiency in an increasingly automated and interconnected world, with a view to partnering with visionary founders building solutions that secure the foundations of the next technological era. The focus of Naoris Ventures will extend across sectors where security and reliability are essential to stability and progress, such as robotics, smart cities, energy, finance, defense, and AI systems.

Last month Naoris was also cited in a research submission to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the reference model for quantum-resistant blockchain infrastructure in its Post-Quantum Financial Infrastructure Framework (PQFIF). The research document, submitted to the U.S. Crypto Assets Task Force, highlights the existential threat of quantum computing to global financial systems and outlines a roadmap for protecting trillions of dollars in digital assets. Within this framework, Naoris Protocol is recognized as a proven, evidence-based implementation model for industry-wide adoption.

Earlier this year Naoris raised $3 million in a strategic funding round led by Mason Labs, with participation from Tim Draper, Frekaz Group, Level One Robotics and Tradecraft Capital.
		



Since launching its testnet in January, Naoris Protocol has recorded significant growth, with over 104 million post-quantum transactions processed, over 3.3 million wallets onboarded, over 1 million security nodes and over 544 million cyber threats mitigated as well as 31 active projects under development across sectors such as finance, telecom, energy, defense, and IoT.

At Hong Kong Fintech Week it was announced that Project Ensemble is entering a live pilot phase. The initiative supports wholesale CBDC, tokenized deposits and tokenized assets. HSBC CEO Georges Elhedery told the audience that three days earlier HSBC had exchanged interoperable tokenized deposits with Standard Chartered in Hong Kong.

Standard Chartered's CEO Bill Winters was upbeat about blockchain. He said “pretty much all transactions will settle on blockchains eventually and that all money will be digital. Think about what that means. A complete rewiring of the financial system.” However, exactly how that will play out remains unclear, so there is a need for the experimentation that is happening in Hong Kong.

From an international perspective, he observed that Hong Kong Dollar tokenized deposits and HKD stablecoins could become “a really interesting … medium of exchange for international trade”. That's partly because it is linked to the US dollar.

Key Takeaways

DASH and ZEC surged significantly due to rising societal concern over digital surveillance and the urgent need for confidential financial interactions.

High-profile investor endorsements and the view of financial privacy as a fundamental, threatened right are driving the privacy coin's rallies.

Upcoming EU regulations (July 2027) targeting “anonymity-enhancing coins” will likely split the sector into compliance-forward and privacy-maximalist assets.

The privacy coin sector has seen a 64.35% surge in Dash (DASH) and 70% in Zcash (ZEC) within the last 7 days. This signals a growing societal tension between increasing digital surveillance and the fundamental desire for confidential financial interaction.

This price rally kicked off on October 1st. Prominent Silicon Valley angel investor Naval Ravikant declared, “ZCash is insurance for Bitcoin.” Since that call, ZEC has skyrocketed. It is up 452% within October. Moreover, Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, also frequently advocates buying ZEC. On October 30th, he proclaimed, “Nothing can stop this train, ZEC will go to $10,000.”

Nothing stops this train.$ZEC to $10k pic.twitter.com/aNpOmm6ooN

— Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) October 30, 2025



To explain this, the core driver for the recent rallies in both ZEC (now trading at $389.07) and DASH (now at $84.29) is the societal realization. Financial privacy is a right under threat. As global financial systems become more interconnected and transparent, the need for a private on/off-ramp to digital value becomes paramount. This matters for businesses, individuals, and institutions.

In general, privacy coins deliver a benefit extending beyond mere concealment: they ensure true fungibility. This is not how Bitcoin works, where a transaction history can potentially reduce its utility. Privacy coins like ZEC, DASH, and Monero (XMR) guarantee that every unit holds equal value, mirroring physical currency. Monero establishes the gold standard for absolute privacy, using ring signatures and RingCT to hide transaction amounts and addresses by default. 

Why the Renewed Interest

The long-term success of this sector hinges upon continued technological evolution and proactive regulatory engagement.

Learn more: SOL, LTC, HBAR ETFs Emerge, Redefining Altcoin Investment

The most significant external factor remains international regulation. The EU's Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR) establishes a strict timeline. Regulated entities in the European Union face a July 1, 2027 deadline to cease maintaining anonymous accounts or handling “anonymity-enhancing coins.” The regulation explicitly targets assets like Monero and Zcash's shielded transactions.

This regulatory mandate forces the sector into a structural split:

The market currently balances the immediate speculative excitement against the longer-term realities of compliance filtering. Experts suggest that protocols demonstrating a capacity for verifiable audit paths while maintaining user confidentiality will secure the most sustainable growth after the current speculative cycle subsides.

The multiplayer battle arena game, ‘Spider Tanks‘, is poised for resurgence under a new guise, ‘Spider Tanks: Cores of Chaos.' Originally launched in 2021 by Dutch-based GAMEDIA, the game encountered operational hurdles with its previous collaborator, Gala Games. Renewed under the partnership with Immutable, the early access for this game is eagerly anticipated on December 8, 2025.

To facilitate a smoother gameplay experience along with scaling benefits, ‘Spider Tanks: Cores of Chaos' will be based on Immutable's Ethereum Layer 2 network. Robbie Ferguson, Co-Founder and President of Immutable, emphasized the synergy between the game and their technology, stating, “Our technology will greatly enhance the user experience, connecting enjoyable, high-quality gameplay with innovative web3 technology.” Dittmar Tukker, CEO of GAMEDIA, outlined their focus on entertainment and transparency in this new venture.

‘Spider Tanks' had a rocky journey with Gala Games, which was marred by disagreements over focus and direction as Gala expanded into other ventures like film and real estate. This partnership deteriorated by mid-2024, and by October 2023, GAMEDIA decided to sever ties. The intellectual property dispute that followed culminated in the Central District Court of California dismissing the case in September 2024, favoring neither party but enabling GAMEDIA to proceed independently.

Post-legal struggles, 2024 and 2025 were pivotal years establishing the collaboration between Immutable and GAMEDIA, marked by mutual interactions and social media updates. Fans of the game had their interest reignited by a teaser video released in August, hinting at the game's return. ‘Spider Tanks: Cores of Chaos' sets a new chapter for this entity in the realm of web3 gaming, highlighting an enduring commitment to innovation, community engagement, and delivering a quality gaming experience. The community can follow developments and interact through a dedicated Discord server, staying connected and informed about upcoming features and releases.

October 2025 -The Solana blockchain welcomes its newest viral sensation, AstroPurr ($PURR) a memecoin that merges the world's affection for cats with the boundless creativity and humor of the crypto community. Designed to bring entertainment, transparency, and community engagement together, AstroPurr is set to redefine what a meme-driven digital asset can achieve.

AstroPurr is more than another token in the memecoin space; it's a movement built on humor, culture, and collaboration. With its charming astronaut cat mascot and a mission to “meme responsibly,” AstroPurr seeks to become the most beloved cat-themed cryptocurrency in the Solana ecosystem.

Holders, known as “Purrnauts,” are invited to join a global community where fun meets purpose. Through staking, NFT integrations, and decentralized governance, AstroPurr creates a unique space where entertainment aligns with ethical tokenomics.

AstroPurr's mission extends beyond memes and viral content. The project aims to establish a sustainable, community-led ecosystem that rewards active participation and creativity. Each aspect of the project — from its branding to its roadmap — emphasizes collective growth, transparency, and innovation.

“AstroPurr is a celebration of internet culture and decentralized technology,” said a spokesperson for the AstroPurr team. “We wanted to build something that brings people together through humor, art, and blockchain utility — all while keeping the spirit of crypto fun and accessible.”

Built on the Solana network, AstroPurr leverages low transaction fees, high scalability, and eco-friendly infrastructure, making it both efficient and sustainable for users and developers alike.

AstroPurr's blend of humor, transparency, and engagement marks a new chapter in the memecoin evolution. As digital communities increasingly shape cultural and financial trends, AstroPurr stands poised to become a leading force in bridging blockchain innovation with internet-native creativity.

The team's vision is clear: to make AstroPurr not only a token for fun and laughter, but a symbol of community empowerment and decentralized belonging in the Solana ecosystem.

Ever wondered why paying with crypto still feels like something from the future instead of a normal part of life?

A London startup called SpacePay might finally be the one to make it happen. The company is building a simple way for people to spend digital currencies in physical stores without any extra hardware or confusion.

SpacePay's system connects digital money to everyday shopping. It works on existing Android payment terminals, so merchants do not need to buy new machines. A simple software update turns the device into one that can process crypto payments. This keeps costs low and removes the biggest reason many businesses avoid crypto: expensive equipment and complex setup.

People can pay through more than 325 different crypto wallets, from MetaMask to Trust Wallet and many others. That kind of flexibility means they can stick with the apps they already use. On the other side, shop owners get their money right away in their local currency, without stressing over sudden changes in crypto prices.

The fees also make a real difference. SpacePay takes only 0.5% per transaction, compared with the 2% to 4% that card companies usually charge. For a small business, that saving can quickly turn into extra breathing room each month.

Security also plays a major role. The platform uses bank-grade encryption and constant monitoring to detect suspicious activity in real time. It gives both buyers and sellers confidence that each transaction is safe from fraud.

SpacePay focuses on practical use, not hype. It allows crypto payments to feel just like regular card payments. Merchants see transactions appear in their system as they normally would. There is no need to understand blockchain or learn new tools.

The key idea is to make digital money as easy to use as cash or a debit card. Crypto payments through SpacePay happen in seconds, and the merchant receives their funds right away in fiat. The platform also shields them from price volatility by converting crypto into their chosen currency automatically.

This combination of accessibility, security, and speed gives SpacePay a clear utility. Businesses can accept crypto customers without taking any financial risk. Customers can spend their digital assets without going through exchanges or waiting for confirmations that take minutes. It feels normal and reliable, which is exactly what mainstream adoption needs.

At the core of SpacePay's setup is the $SPY token, the link between users, merchants, and the wider community. The presale has already brought in over $1.4 million, which shows that the idea is catching on with early supporters.

Right now, $SPY tokens sell for $0.003181 in the presale. Out of 34 billion total tokens, most go toward the public sale, growth, partnerships, and rewards. The team kept only a small portion, which shows they're focused on long-term goals rather than quick gains.

Holding $SPY gives users several benefits inside the ecosystem. People who hold the tokens can join community votes, earn loyalty rewards, and try out new features before they're released to everyone else. There is also a plan for revenue sharing, where part of the transaction income goes back to token holders. This setup connects community growth to the platform's success.

Investors can take part in the presale using cryptocurrencies such as ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, USDT, and USDC, or even through bank cards. It is designed to be accessible to both crypto users and those just starting out.



SpacePay has already moved beyond ideas. The company launched its SpacePay One Testnet, an early version of its payment API that allows developers and merchants to test how the system works. It supports Ethereum Sepolia and Base Sepolia networks and provides a working payment widget with an easy checkout flow.

The testnet proves that SpacePay isn't sitting around waiting for funding to start work – the groundwork is already done. Early users can try out payments, watch how fast the funds settle, and see crypto turn into regular money in real time. The team then takes what testers learn from those runs and fine-tunes the system before rolling it out fully.

SpacePay combines real-world usability, low fees, and a live product, which sets it apart from many token projects that only exist on paper. Merchants can accept cryptocurrency using their existing card machines, and customers can spend digital assets as easily as tapping a card.

So far, SpacePay has pulled in more than $1.4 million, built support for hundreds of wallets, and launched a working testnet – solid signs that things are moving forward. The presale gives a glimpse of how the team plans to expand its network through genuine community input and smart, practical ideas.

Looking ahead, SpacePay's focus on keeping things easy to use and reliable might help it stand apart in a market that's full of talk but short on real results. If paying with crypto ever becomes as normal as tapping a card, this project could play a big part in getting there.

Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is emerging just as the Federal Reserve shifts from tightening to easing. Following the October 29 rate cut and a $29 billion liquidity injection, the Fed has made clear that financial conditions are entering a looser phase – and that typically favors Bitcoin and risk assets.

As liquidity returns, the timing is perfect for Bitcoin Hyper as it continues to gain traction, securing $25.6 million in presale funding while advancing development of what it calls the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin.

Its design introduces a two-layer architecture: an execution layer powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for high-speed, low-cost transactions, and a settlement layer anchored to the Bitcoin network for finality and security, now reinforced by the project's newly detailed security framework that ensures integrity across both layers.

The HYPER token, which sits at the center of this ecosystem as the gas, staking, and governance currency, is set to become more expensive in the next presale round, scheduled to begin in 24 hours. For now, there's still time to secure HYPER at $0.013215 per token.

Last Wednesday, the Fed lowered the benchmark federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points to a new range of 3.75%–4.00%. 

The move marked the second cut of the year and came amid a backdrop of slowing job growth, elevated inflation, and a government shutdown that left many key economic reports missing in action.

At the same meeting, the Fed also announced it would end its balance-sheet runoff beginning December 1, effectively signaling the end of its quantitative-tightening mode. 

Then, on October 31, the Fed injected $29.4 billion into the banking system via its standing repo facility, which is the largest such liquidity boost since the pandemic.

🚨 The FED just cut interest rates and officially ended Quantitative Tightening.

Liquidity is back, and Bitcoin is going higher.🚀 pic.twitter.com/KO1ldqHdxF

— PlasBit (@PlasBit) October 29, 2025



The operation was designed to ease short-term funding stress among banks and stabilize overnight lending rates, which had started to rise as reserves in the system tightened. By adding cash, the Fed ensured banks could continue meeting daily funding needs without disrupting broader credit markets.

For Bitcoin (BTC), moves like this have historically marked the start of a liquidity window, i.e. periods when central bank support coincides with renewed market risk appetite. Each time the Fed has shifted from tightening to stabilizing liquidity, Bitcoin has typically responded with stronger inflows and higher volatility to the upside.

Amid this backdrop, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as the project that can amplify that momentum, building the infrastructure that turns Bitcoin's growing value base into a functional, scalable ecosystem.

With liquidity flowing back into markets, Bitcoin Hyper is pressing ahead with development, refining the architecture designed to make Bitcoin more than a passive store of value. The project is now focused on strengthening its dual-layer framework, where the SVM handles execution speed and scalability, while Bitcoin anchors settlement and finality.

The team's latest update places stronger emphasis on security integrity, ensuring that every state change within the network remains verifiable against Bitcoin's base layer. In practice, this means transactions execute at Solana-level speed but ultimately settle on Bitcoin, combining performance with immutability. 

Developers can use familiar SVM tools to deploy DeFi, gaming, and other high-throughput applications – all within Bitcoin's security umbrella.



https://twitter.com/BTC_Hyper2/status/1984992067454390671

This phase also introduces new operational safeguards, including transparent sequencing, reproducible builds, and community-led verification, designed to make every component auditable and tamper-resistant. Each enhancement reinforces Bitcoin Hyper's guiding principle: scalability should never come at the expense of trust.

Together, these developments push Bitcoin Hyper closer to its goal of extending Bitcoin's security into a new, faster ecosystem that expands what's possible without compromising what makes Bitcoin reliable.

Overall, Bitcoin Hyper marks the point where Bitcoin shifts from being stored to being used, which creates an ecosystem where BTC becomes the medium of exchange powering applications in DeFi, gaming, and real-world use cases, rather than sitting idle in wallets.

As network infrastructure and developer activity accelerate, securing HYPER early means holding the token that underpins and governs this expanding on-chain economy.

And getting in now offers investors the chance to secure HYPER at its lowest price before the next round begins.

To participate in the presale, visit the Bitcoin Hyper website and purchase HYPER using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card.



As mentioned, HYPER also serves as the project's staking currency, with its native staking protocol currently offering a 46% dynamic APY. For the most seamless experience, use Best Wallet – widely regarded as the best crypto and Bitcoin wallet. 

HYPER is already listed under Best Wallet's Upcoming Tokens section, making it easy to buy, track, and claim once live.

The Best Wallet app is available on Google Play and the Apple App Store.

Oops, something went wrong

Brazilian financial giant Banco Inter and Chainlink have completed a blockchain-based pilot that enabled the central banks of Brazil and Hong Kong to settle a cross-border trade transaction in real time using digital currencies and smart contracts.

The test was part of Phase 2 of the Central Bank of Brazil's Drex digital currency initiative, which aims to create a digital version of Brazil's real. It linked Brazil's Drex network with Hong Kong's Ensemble platform, overseen by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).

Chainlink's infrastructure provided the connection between the two systems, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk, allowing funds and asset records to move across jurisdictions within a single automated workflow.

“By leveraging Chainlink to connect the BCB, the HKMA, and trade finance platforms, we're building a more connected financial ecosystem that has the ability to underpin the future of global trade,” said Bruno Grossi, Head of Digital Assets at Banco Inter.

The pilot featured both delivery-versus-payment (DvP) and payment-versus-payment (PvP) model tests. These mechanisms allow for the simultaneous transfer of goods and payments, reducing settlement risk.

The system also supported conditional and installment-based payments, such as releasing funds when a specific part of the trade process is confirmed.

Supporting organizations included Standard Chartered, the Global Shipping Business Network (GSBN), and 7COMm. GSBN's platform handled updates to the electronic bill of lading (eBL) as part of the payment process.

The project is being positioned as a potential foundation for a more inclusive trade finance ecosystem. By removing manual processes and improving coordination across platforms, the solution could reduce costs for banks and exporters, especially smaller firms.

The partners now plan to expand testing to cover additional trade models and connect to more financial institutions.

US President Donald Trump says he does not know who Changpeng Zhao is, despite pardoning the cryptocurrency multi-billionaire last month.

Trump was asked about the pardon during an interview with CBS News' 60 Minutes programme, which was broadcast on Sunday.

Zhao, who is also known as ""CZ"", pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering in 2023. He served four months in prison and agreed to step down as the chief executive of Binance, the crypto exchange he co-founded.

His companies have partnered with firms linked to Trump on new digital-currency projects including Dominari Holdings, where his sons sit on the board of advisers and which is based in Trump Tower.

The host of 60 Minutes, Norah O'Donnell, asked Trump why he pardoned Zhao even though government prosecutors had said he caused ""significant harm to US national security.""

""Okay, are you ready? I don't know who he is,"" the president said.

Trump added that he did not recall meeting Zhao and had ""no idea who he is"", only that he had been told that the businessman was a victim of a ""witch hunt"" by the administration of former US President Joe Biden.

During the interview, Trump also discussed his support for cryptocurrencies and said that the US had to make sure it was a leader in the industry or risk China and its rivals gaining an advantage in the emerging technology.

CBS News is the BBC's US news partner.

The president's pardon lifts restrictions that had stopped Zhao from running financial ventures, but it is unclear whether it changes his standing with US regulators or his role at Binance.

At the time of the pardon, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called Zhao's prosecution under the Biden administration part of a ""war on cryptocurrency"", pushing back on critics who said the pardon appeared motivated by Trump's personal financial interests.

""This was an overly prosecuted case by the Biden administration,"" she said, adding that the case had been ""thoroughly reviewed"". ""So the president wants to correct this overreach of the Biden administration's misjustice and he exercised his constitutional authority to do so.""

The Binance platform remains the most used crypto exchange in the world for trading digital assets.

The Trump administration previously halted a fraud case against crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, after his investments in the Trump family's crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.

In May, it was announced that a stablecoin launched by World Liberty Financial would be used by an Abu Dhabi firm for a $2bn (£1.52bn) investment in Binance.

Trump has also pardoned founders of the crypto exchange BitMEX, who faced charges related to money laundering, and Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road, the dark web marketplace known as a place for drug trade.

One in eight Americans receive a food assistance programme called Snap, which has gone unfunded since Saturday. 

Left-wing candidate Zohran Mamdani is leading many opinion polls in Tuesday's mayoral race.

The US president also suggests Nicolás Maduro's days as the South American country's leader are numbered.

The US president says his threat is over killings of Christians - though experts say there is no evidence they are disproportionately targeted.

The actor - a prominent Democratic fundraiser - also says he has no regrets about calling for Biden to quit the US presidential race.

Changpeng Zhao, who started the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has strongly disputed rumours that he was involved in setting up a private crypto bank in Kyrgyzstan. Local news reports said that Zhao was suggesting the development of an organization called “Bereket Bank” that would focus on digital assets and not be owned by the government or a family.

Zhao directly addressed the rumours in a post on X, saying, “This isn't correct… I never proposed that I start a bank myself. Banks should collaborate with crypto in general, but I don't want to run one”. Zhao's statement emphasizes his broader push for integrating cryptocurrencies into regular finance without having to personally run any operations.

Zhao's explanation follows a visit to Kyrgyzstan earlier this month that garnered significant attention. He attended the second meeting of the National Council for the Development of Virtual Assets and Blockchain Technologies. 

As a strategic consultant to the council, Zhao spoke with key individuals about the country's expanding digital asset ecosystem. He also met with Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov during his visit, which demonstrated the country's openness to new ideas in blockchain technology.

The rumors came out at the same time as a number of important changes in Kyrgyzstan's crypto scene. The government said it would launch its national stablecoin, KGST, constructed on the BNB Chain, which is Binance's own blockchain, just a few days after Zhao's meetings. 

This decision enables KGST to facilitate easier business transactions across borders for people in the landlocked Central Asian country, as well as to provide broader access to financial services for all.

To make these efforts even stronger, the government announced intentions to create a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that would be used for government payments. The plan includes setting up a national cryptocurrency reserve to help the economy stay stable and bring in foreign investment. 

In a recent X post, Zhao personally talked about these improvements and praised Kyrgyzstan's forward-thinking approach to digital money.

At the same time, Zhao said that Binance Academy would work with ten of Kyrgyzstan's top colleges. The goal of these agreements is to include blockchain education in school curricula so that the next generation may learn how to use virtual assets and decentralized technologies. 

These kinds of actions have clearly led people to believe that Zhao has more power, which could make them think his advice is actually about commercial deals.

Kyrgyzstan is still working on improving the rules for digital assets, even with all these new ideas. Lawmakers are discussing amendments to the “On Virtual Assets” bill that would establish a state-backed crypto reserve. This structure would enhance control and mitigate risks as the sector continues to grow rapidly.

The proposed amendments also state that the current Financial Market Regulation and Supervision Service will no longer be responsible for regulating the market. Instead, a new body selected by the president will be in charge. 

The bill is still waiting for final approval, and the organization has not yet been named, but these measures show that Kyrgyzstan is committed to creating a safe, unified system for managing virtual assets.

Zhao's denial serves as a reminder of the fine line between being an advisor and an entrepreneur as Central Asia becomes a centre for crypto adoption. Kyrgyzstan's continuous changes, including the implementation of the KGST and educational outreach, show that the market is growing and ready to connect with more global blockchain networks.

With Eric Benoist, Tech and Data Research Specialist, and Rita Boutros, Tech and Data Research, we explore how the ‘unseen' digital industry is reinventing itself as it sits at the crossroads of technology, energy and geopolitics.

Behind every Bitcoin transaction lies a vast “invisible” network of computers racing to solve puzzles. This process is known as mining – and it secures the entire Bitcoin ecosystem, allowing it to function without banks or middlemen.

Today, Bitcoin miners are often viewed as guardians of the decentralized monetary network. Maintaining the trustless system that allows the exchange of value online, without central oversight.

Bitcoin miners are often viewed as guardians of the decentralized monetary network.

But the golden age of mining is over, and the mining world is facing its toughest challenge yet; shrinking rewards and rising costs are forcing operators to reinvent or retreat.

To understand why mining matters, its helps to first understand what secures it: the blockchain.

Blockchain is a shared database that records transactions across a network of computers. Once a transaction is stored in the database, it cannot be altered. Each block of data is linked to the block before it, creating a chain that is transparent, verifiable, and nearly impossible to tamper with. And because the blockchain is distributed, everyone in the network has the same copy of the record. If one computer tries to cheat, the rest reject it. This makes the system immutable and decentralized, meaning no single party can control it.

Mining keeps this process honest. Through a protocol called Proof of Work, miners compete to solve mathematical puzzles. The winner adds the next block in the chain and earns a reward in newly created Bitcoin(s). This is fundamental to keeping operations secure and decentralized as it encourages fair participation.

Mining today has become a high-stakes balancing act between efficiency and cost. Perhaps the biggest challenge is Bitcoin's built-in halving mechanism, which sees block “rewards” cut in half every 4 years. This event decreases the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation and compresses miner income overnight. For example, what was a reward of 6.25 Bitcoins per block became 3.125 Bitcoins per block on the last halving event in April 2024.

Mining today has become a high-stakes balancing act between efficiency and cost.

In theory, long-term Bitcoin appreciation should compensate these cuts, but energy prices, hardware costs and even network competition often squeeze profits.  Thus, even when Bitcoin is up, there can still be sustained pressure on earnings.

Meanwhile, another challenge comes from network difficulty – a self-adjusting feature that ensures blocks are created roughly every ten minutes, no matter how many miners join the race. Meaning it's getting harder and harder for miners to earn rewards.

As a result, only the most efficient well-capitalised operators can survive.

To stay afloat, Miners are experimenting with new strategies, and reinvention is already well under way. Some are fine tuning energy management to ensure absolute efficiency, others are turning to custom software to cut costs. But the biggest shift comes from miners repurposing their infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI) and High-Performance Computing (HPC) – industries that require vast amounts of energy and computing power, something which miners poses in abundance.

To stay afloat, Bitcoin miners are experimenting with new strategies, and reinvention is already well under way.

This is somewhat of a natural evolution, as the data centers once built for Bitcoin are well-suited to power-hungry AI workloads and so can offer steady contracted revenues instead of volatile crypto-driven income. That said, it's not an easy pivot. Bitcoin facilities are optimized for simple, repetitive tasks, while AI requires advanced networking and cooling.

For miners that remain focused on Bitcoin itself, the next frontier is financial innovation. Derivative tools, like hashrate forwards, allow miners to hedge against volatile market conditions. Such contracts can stabilise revenue and manage short-term cash flow, turning what was once a high-risk business into a more structured, strategic operation.

The energy use for Bitcoin mining has long been a source of criticism. Detractors call miners “greedy opportunists” who consume “vast amounts of electricity in pursuit of speculative profits”, regardless of the impact – societal or environmental. But the reality is more nuanced.

Bitcoin mining has long been a source of criticism... But the reality is more nuanced.

Mining farms are flexible consumers of power – they can shut down or restart almost instantly. That makes them valuable partners for renewable grids, which need adaptable demand to balance fluctuating supply. The sector's flexible energy demand, geographic mobility, and growing symbiosis with renewable and stranded power make it an underappreciated asset within modern electricity grids.

Some miners already run on surplus hydropower or capture flare gas that would otherwise be wasted. Others repurpose their waste heat to warm greenhouses and buildings. In this way, mining can support rather than compete with the energy transition.

Beyond the environmental debate, there's also a geopolitical layer. Where Bitcoin mining happens, and who controls it, matters. Control over hash rate is increasingly viewed through the “prism of national resilience”. If most mining were concentrated in a single country, that nation could, in theory, influence how the global network functions.

Thus, keeping mining geographically diverse is a matter of strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty. In plain terms, it's about ensuring no single state dominates the backbone of a decentralised financial system.

The future of mining remains uncertain. On one hand, the industry faces relentless economic and environmental pressures. On the other, it is evolving in fascinating ways, merging with renewable energy, advanced computing, and even national strategy.

To view mining solely through the lens of short-term return on investment is to overlook its broader significance. It's not just about creating Bitcoins. It's about maintaining a decentralised network, supporting modern energy systems, and preserving digital sovereignty.

To view Bitcoin mining solely through the lens of short-term return on investment is to overlook its broader significance.

The miners who adapt – whether by partnering with renewables, integrating AI, or strengthening national infrastructure – are redefining what it means to extract value in the digital age.

For all the controversy it attracts, Bitcoin mining may prove to be one of the most unexpected and consequential industries of the 21st century.

Investor demand for financial privacy is fueling a rally in privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, signaling renewed interest in self-sovereign blockchain transactions.

The market capitalization of privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies rose by about 80% over the past week to briefly surpass $24 billion earlier on Monday before retracing 2.9% to $23.7 billion at the time of writing, according to data aggregator CoinGecko.

Dash DASHUSD and Zcash ZECUSD were among the best-performing privacy coins last week, with 65% and 9.55% gains, respectively.

The privacy coin rally occurred despite a wider crypto market downturn, which saw the total crypto market cap decline by 3.7% over the past week, from $3.96 trillion to $3.81 trillion, signaling increasing investor demand for financial privacy.

Privacy coins such as Zcash and Monero XMRUSD obscure sender, receiver and transaction details, offering greater anonymity than pseudonymous cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTCUSD. 

Investors seek financial privacy, “encrypted” Bitcoin: Nansen analyst

“Privacy is increasingly viewed as a necessity rather than a feature,” Jake Kennis, senior research analyst at Nansen, told Cointelegraph. “This renews ideological demand for private, self-sovereign transactions.”

Kennis said the expansion of Zcash's shielded pool and improvements in its technology, including the Zashi wallet for shielded transfers and Solana integration, are making privacy transactions more accessible.

Zcash's fixed supply of 21 million coins, its proof-of-work (PoW) consensus model and its privacy setting based on zk-SNARK technology position it as an “encrypted Bitcoin” for investors seeking private transactions, added Kennis.

Zk-SNARKs are cryptographic primitives that can sever any tractable piece of data between two parties over a public blockchain network, aiming to strengthen digital privacy. They are an interaction of zero-knowledge proof technology.

Arthur Hayes tips $10,000 ZEC tokens before Zcash hits eight-year high

Zcash surged to an over eight-year high of $388 on Friday, briefly flipping Monero to become the most valuable privacy coin.

The rise to the eight-year high came days after BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted a ZEC token rally to $10,000, further bolstering buzz around the token.

Zcash rallied from $272 to a peak of $355 in the hours after Hayes's bullish prediction on Sunday, Cointelegraph reported.

Strive (ASST), a Nasdaq-listed asset manager with a bitcoin BTC$107,369.54 treasury strategy, announced plans Monday an initial public offering of a new class of preferred shares designed to pay dividends.

The Series A Variable Rate Perpetual Preferred Stock, dubbed SATA, aims to pay an initial 12% annual dividend, paid monthly in cash. The company set to offer 1.25 million SATA to investors, raising funds to acquire more BTC and expand its operations, while proceeds may also go toward income-generating assets, working capital or repurchasing common stock. Strive currently holds just under 6,000 BTC, valued at roughly $637 million at current prices, an amount that will rise to roughly 11,000 coins should it complete its all-stock merger with Semler Scientific (SMLR).

A nearly unrelenting sell-off in its common stock since completing a SPAC deal several weeks ago, has left Strive trading at a discount to the value of the bitcoin on its balance sheet (an mNAV of below 1). Thus, issuing common stock for continued bitcoin purchases would be highly dilutive to existing shareholders.

The move to instead issue preferred stock follows the footsteps of pioneering bitcoin treasury firm Strategy, which began issuing various classes of preferred shares to broaden its options to raise capital for BTC purchases.

Again in a nod to Saylor and team. Strive said it plans to maintain SATA's trading range between $95 and $105 per share by adjusting dividend rates within set limits. If dividends go unpaid, the rate compounds monthly, eventually reaching up to 20% annually, per the press release.

Barclays and Cantor Fitzgerald will act as joint book-runners for the offering, with Clear Street as co-manager. A $12 per share dividend reserve will be set aside to cover the first year of distributions.

ASST shares are lower by 2.3% on Monday alongside a 4% slide in the price of bitcoin to $106,000. SMLR is down 2.5%.

The offering comes as digital asset treasury stocks crumbled over the past months, many now trading below the value of the underlying holdings, limiting their ability to raise fresh funds to continue their crypto purchases.

Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin BTC$107,369.54, reported on Monday it purchased $45.6 million in BTC through last week, bringing its stash to 641,205 coins worth over $69 billion. 

According to the firm's filing, the company acquired 397 BTC at an average price of $114,771 last week. Strategy funded the purchase mostly via the sale of common stock, though small amounts of the company's various preferred shares were also issued. A late weekend and Monday morning slide has the price of bitcoin trading below $108,000 at press time.

Alongside its third quarter earnings report late last week, Strategy issued guidance that it would not raise money through common stock sales when its enterprise value was less than 2.5 times the value of the bitcoin on its balance sheet (the so-called mNAV).

The unrelenting slide in MSTR's share price in recent months, though, has left its mNAV at barely more than 1x, so its highly likely that any more share sales — and thus sizable bitcoin buys — are off the table for the foreseeable future.

MSTR is lower by 1.7% in premarket trading.

Bitcoin BTC$107,369.54 miners are now an integral part of the artificial intelligence (AI) value chain, Wall Street broker Bernstein said in a note Monday updating its model for the sector. 

The broker argued that miners' large-scale power infrastructure and facilities have become critical to AI data centers, now seen as the biggest execution bottleneck for the fast-growing industry.

Every U.S.-listed bitcoin miner the broker covers has pivoted toward maximizing the value of its power assets rather than betting on bitcoin price upside, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

The firm's analysts abandoned their discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology in favor of a sum-of-parts valuation, combining miners' bitcoin holdings, mining EBITDA, AI co-location and cloud revenues, and the potential value of power sites earmarked for AI data centers—using a conservative $3 million per megawatt (MW) multiple.

Bernstein lifted its price target for Core Scientific (CORZ) to $24 from $17, citing the company's pivot toward high-performance computing (HPC) colocation and its plan to deliver about 590 megawatts of IT load by early 2027. 

The report noted that shareholders' rejection of the CoreWeave deal gives management more room to optimize value and hinted at a new partnership expected in the fourth quarter.

Riot Platforms (RIOT) also saw its target raised to $25 from $19, reflecting the AI potential of its 1-gigawatt Corsicana site. while CleanSpark (CLSK) was lifted to $24 from $20 as it moves toward a hybrid bitcoin-AI model through new hires and partnerships. 

Bernstein rates IREN, CORZ, RIOT, and CLSK outperform, the broker said bitcoin miners with active or potential AI contracts are being re-rated by the market as key enablers of the next generation of computing infrastructure.

Mining stocks were flying in premarket trading following news of IREN's AI cloud deal with Microsoft.

IREN was 21% higher in early trade, around $60.75. Core Scientific shares were 6.8% higher at $23. Riot stock was 3% higher at $20.38. CleanSpark rose 3.6% to $18.44.

First-Ever Footage Shows Killer Whales Attacking Great White Shark Nursery

An orca pod has been spotted for the first time repeatedly targeting and flipping young great white sharks onto their backs to paralyze and dismember them

Orcas, or “killer whales,” are not known for their amiable demeanor. The famous bullies attack boats and pester other animals for reasons that sometimes aren't entirely clear. Now, for the first time, they've been spotted repeatedly targeting young great white sharks in a shark nursery, according to a new paper published in Frontiers in Marine Science.

Researchers watched two hunts via drone while monitoring orcas in the Gulf of California. Newly released footage from August 2020 shows the first clash, during which five orcas teamed up to go great white shark tipping. After shoving a shark up to the surface, the orcas rolled it onto its back.

At that point, the battle was already won. Flipping a shark upside down induces a paralyzing state called tonic immobility, similar to a case of the twisties for a gymnast; it throws off the shark's spatial awareness and disrupts the connection between the animal's mind and body.

The orcas then repeated the process with another young great white shark. In both cases, they went to all of that trouble mainly for each shark's liver because the organ is loaded with nutrients and energy.

Two years later, in August 2022, the researchers saw a repeat: five orcas flipped over a young great white shark and ate its liver.

The observations were detailed enough that researchers could identify and track individual orcas by their dorsal fin, confirming that the same group—known as the Moctezuma pod, after its best-known member—was behind both attacks.

“This behavior is a testament to orcas' advanced intelligence, strategic thinking, and sophisticated social learning, as the hunting techniques are passed down through generations within their pods,” said marine biologist Erick Higuera Rivas, who led the new paper, in a recent press release.

While scientists had previously seen orcas attack great whites, the killer whales mainly targeted adults, both for a larger meal and to get rid of competition for the same prey. The newly reported sightings represent the first direct evidence of orcas hunting down young great whites specifically. The researchers say the strange behavior may be linked to climate-change-induced warming waters, which seem to be pushing shark nurseries into the orca pod's hunting grounds.

Because baby sharks are on their own from day one, their nurseries are really more like orphanages––there are no adults around to guard the little ones as they mature. That generally works fine because the animals have so few predators. But now that they've moved into dangerous waters, they may be forced to relocate once again.

“Nursery areas are where young sharks spend time growing and learning to forage, so displacing them from those habitats can be disruptive,” says Alison Towner, a marine biologist at Rhodes University in South Africa, who specializes in orca predation of sharks but wasn't involved in the new study. “If the pressure is occasional, the impact may be limited. But if it becomes repeated, it could force juveniles into less suitable or riskier areas” and ultimately disrupt the entire ecosystem.

Death and taxes have always been inevitable, even in the ancient world.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The ancient Assyrians couldn't exactly take to the phones like the IRS, making incessant calls demanding that loyal subjects of the kingdom pay their taxes by the deadline, but they did have vaguely threatening clay tablets promising to punish late payments. Some things never change.

Even kings were not exempt from taxes. Between the 8th and 7th centuries B.C.E., also known as the First Temple Period, the Neo-Assyrian empire conquered the southern kingdom of Judah and other adjacent regions, declaring them to be vassal kingdoms under their rule. Kings Hezekiah and Manasseh were the heads of Judah during this period. Ancient texts do not make either sound thrilled to bend the knee. 

Hezekiah's refusal to pay tribute to his rival is described in the Bible and led to Assyrian king Sennacherib's forces barging into Judah. While the reluctance of the king to pay his taxes may have not been the only reason behind the Assyrian invasion, it is linked to a 2,700-year-old clay fragment of a royal seal recently unearthed in Jerusalem's Old City at an archaeological site at the Davidson Archaeological Park next to the Western Wall. Overdue taxes were supposed to be paid by the first of the month of Av, the fifth month of the Jewish calendar that is between July and August. 

Assyrian accounts of the time revealed that Sennacherib demanded exorbitant tribute payments from Judah after Jerusalem had been crushed. A royal envoy from the Assyrian court, known as a “chariot officer” or “the holder of the reigns,” apparently delivered the message with the seal, though both messenger and king go unnamed. The Iron Age fragment is only an inch long, but carries a message with the resonance of a booming voice. 

“Dear king of Judah,” it reads in Akkadian, an ancient language related to Arabic and Hebrew, “send the tribute quickly by the first of Av—and if not, the consequences will be severe.”

Archaeologist Ayala Zilberstein of the Israel Antiquities Authority is excavation director at the Davidson site, located west of the Temple Mount, where she and her team have been investigating the remains of a building from the period during which the Judeans became Assyrian vassals. She and her team keep finding other seals and more evidence that suggest high-level administrative business carried out by people involved with the court and the king. It was her colleague Moriah Cohen who identified the seal while sifting through a pile of rubble.

“At first I thought the markings were decorative,” she recently told The Jerusalem Post. “Then I realized it was writing, and when I understood it might be cuneiform, I screamed. Everyone ran over. To think I was the first person in 2,700 years to touch it was incredible.”

While cuneiform writings on clay tablets and prisms have survived for millennia, there had been no direct evidence of official correspondence between Assyria and Judah until the discovery of this artifact. It was not locally produced. Petrographic analysis revealed that the source of the clay it is made from lies far north of Jerusalem in the Tigris river basin, near Assyria's most powerful cities. 

“We have the connection between archeology, history, and science,” Assyriologist Peter Zilberg of Bar-Ilan University told The Times of Israel. “This artifact is very, very important in connecting the history of the Land of Israel to the Bible and to the history of the ancient Near East as a whole.”

Both the Bible and Assyrian sources say that Hezekiah eventually relented. He later sent a message to the king of Assyria at Lachish, admitting he had done wrong and giving the Assyrians permission to extract payment from him. Hezekiah was fined 300 silver talents and 30 gold talents for his tax delinquency. Even back then, this is what happened if you didn't pay your taxes.

The Revolutionary War artifacts tell the story of what General Cornwallis tried to destroy forever—but couldn't erase.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

British General Charles Cornwallis ordered the burning of a Continental Army barracks in Colonial Williamsburg in 1781. What he hoped to destroy forever was recently found by archaeologists, giving experts a fresh perspective on the life of Continental soldiers during the Revolutionary War. 

As crews made way for the construction of a new sports center on Colonial Williamsburg Foundation property, archaeologists first took to the area to see if 18th century maps and period documents referencing the construction of barracks in 1776 through 1777 produced any archaeological fruit. 

They have plenty to pick from, as the nearly four-acre site has artifacts showing both the barracks and everyday life of soldiers. 

“Archaeological evidence of continental barracks in Virginia is rare,” the foundation says in a blog post. “This site, which was occupied from 1777-1781, is particularly valuable since it was built and used only for one purpose. In addition, a significant portion of the site has been largely undisturbed since the barracks were destroyed.” 

Archaeologists have excavated only a small section of the area—the sports center was shifted on the site to ensure future exploration of the barracks—but the team has already found bricks and an intact chimney base, gun hardware, lead musket shot with toothmarks, high-end ceramics, and personal items likely owned by officers. 

“What we know about the barracks from historical documentation is that, in August 1776, just a month after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Commonwealth of Virginia ordered the construction of those barracks, Jack Gary, executive director of archaeology for the foundation, tells Fox News Digital. 

The barracks were said to house up to 2,000 soldiers and 100 horses, even if they were originally anticipated to accommodate 1,000 soldiers.

Those barracks didn't last long, though, with Gary saying a report from a soldier describes the burning of the barracks by British troops while they moved toward Yorktown in 1781. 

“Later on, after the Cornwallis troops moved through, they could see the barracks on fire in the distance … For us as archaeologists, this is a burning event, which is a catastrophic event,” Gary tells Fox News. “But it can also lend itself to really good preservation.” 

One of the more intriguing items discovered is the bounty of lead shot with toothmarks. The foundation's blog post says the shot was chewed on by bored soldiers to help pass the time, but also because the lead had a sweet taste. 

Experts hope that as they excavate additional sections of the barracks, they discover more about the way of life for Continental Army soldiers in the late 1770s.

What else is hiding down there?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

On October 14, 2024, NASA's Europa Clipper launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for Jupiter's fourth largest moon. Its mission is to assess the moon's potential to host life in the vast ocean beneath its icy crust. While the Europa Clipper is a milestone in humanity's ability to study the oceans of other worlds, Earth's oceans still hold many mysteries yet unsolved by science. 

Without leaving Earth, scientists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) and the Universidad de Concepción in Chile have discovered new life themselves—a previously unknown, active predator in one of the deepest trenches in the world. Four specimens were collected nearly 8,000 meters below sea level (which is almost as deep as Mount Everest is tall), and scientists named the crustacean “Dulcibella camanchaca”—a reference to the word for “darkness” in the languages of peoples living in the Andes region. 

Although its white carapace gives it a ghostly, almost Facehugger-from-Alien feel, the name is fitting if you consider that this predator lives out its life 7,000 meters below the aphotic zone, where absolute darkness reigns. The researchers described this new species last year in the journal Systematics and Biodiversity. 

The Atacama Trench, also known as the Peru-Chile Trench, stretches about 3700 miles (6,000 kilometers) along the coast. However, off the coast of northern Chile, the trench plunges to almost 25,246 ft (8,000 m) below the surface—well within the deepest part of the ocean, known as the Hadal zone. 

Scientists have long been interested in exploring this zone, and the discoveries haven't disappointed. In 2023, the Instituto Milenio de Oceanografía (IMO)—based at Universidad de Concepción in Chile—carried out a deep ocean survey aboard the research vessel Abate Molina, which was originally donated to Chile by the Japanese government in the early 90s. Once the specimens were recovered, they were frozen for preservation and subsequently underwent genomic analysis.

""Most excitingly, the DNA and morphology data pointed to this species being a new genus too, emphasizing the Atacama Trench as an endemic hotspot,” Johanna Weston, lead author of the study and expert on the Hadal zone from WHOI, said in a press statement. 

True to its Alien-like appearance, D. camanchaca has a spine-tingling way of devouring its prey—using its raptorial appendages to essentially clamp down on other, smaller crustaceans. (Remind you of anything?) Because of its deep ocean environment, this mighty crustacean, which is only roughly four centimeters in length, can also withstand pressures up to 800 times stronger than pressures found on land. 

“This finding underlines the importance of continued deep-ocean exploration, particularly in Chile's front yard,” IMO's Carolina González, co-lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “More discoveries are expected as we continue to study the Atacama Trench.”

If something so small can persevere in conditions as adverse as those in the Hadal zone, maybe Europa Clipper has a non-zero shot at finding conditions that could support life in the vast, salty ocean of a whole different world.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Breakthrough blood test finally confirms Chronic Fatigue Syndrome","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251102205021.htm","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 07:25:07 GMT","

Scientists from the University of East Anglia and Oxford BioDynamics have created a highly accurate blood test capable of diagnosing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, also known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS).

The condition, which causes long-term and often debilitating exhaustion, affects millions of people around the world, including more than 400,000 individuals in the UK. Despite its prevalence, ME/CFS has remained poorly understood and notoriously difficult to diagnose.

This new test, which demonstrates 96 percent accuracy, offers renewed hope to patients who have struggled for recognition and reliable answers. Researchers believe the discovery could also lead to a similar test for identifying long Covid.

Validating an Illness Long Dismissed

Lead researcher Prof Dmitry Pshezhetskiy of UEA's Norwich Medical School explained, ""ME/CFS is a serious and often disabling illness characterized by extreme fatigue that is not relieved by rest.

""We know that some patients report being ignored or even told that their illness is 'all in their head'. With no definitive tests, many patients have gone undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years.

""We wanted to see if we could develop a blood test to diagnose the condition -- and we did!

""Our discovery offers the potential for a simple, accurate blood test to help confirm a diagnosis, which could lead to earlier support and more effective management.""

""Post-Covid syndrome, commonly referred to as long Covid, is one example of ME/CFS, where a similar cluster of symptoms is triggered by the Covid-19 virus, rather than by other known causes such as glandular fever. We therefore hope that our research will also help pave the way for a similar test to accurately diagnose long Covid.""

Using DNA Folding to Detect Disease

To develop the test, researchers employed Oxford BioDynamics' advanced EpiSwitch® 3D Genomics technology, which examines how DNA is folded within cells. The study analyzed blood samples from 47 people with severe ME/CFS and compared them to 61 healthy volunteers.

Each human cell contains around two metres of DNA, intricately folded in three dimensions. These folds are not random; they form deliberate patterns that help control how genes are activated or silenced, keeping the body functioning properly.

Alexandre Akoulitchev, Chief Scientific Officer at Oxford BioDynamics, said, ""Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is not a genetic disease you're born with. That's why using EpiSwitch 'epigenetic' markers -- which can change during a person's life, unlike fixed genetic code -- was key to reaching this high level of accuracy.

""The EpiSwitch platform behind this test, together with OBD's vast 3D Genomic knowledgebase, has already been proven to deliver practical, rapid blood diagnostics accessible at scale.

""With this breakthrough, we are proud to enable a first-in-class test that can address an unmet need for a quick and reliable diagnostic for a complex, challenging-to-identify illness.""

Proven Technology Behind the Discovery

EpiSwitch technology has previously helped identify blood-based biomarkers for other complex conditions, including fast-progressing ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), rheumatoid arthritis, and several cancers. It also underpins the EpiSwitch PSE prostate cancer test, which delivers world-leading accuracy and is already in clinical use across the UK and US.

In the ME/CFS study, researchers found a distinctive genomic pattern present only in affected individuals and absent in healthy participants. This work looked beyond the linear DNA sequence explored in the large DecodeME study, which was the most extensive genetic investigation of ME/CFS to date.[1]

By examining the 3D architecture of DNA, the UEA and Oxford BioDynamics team uncovered hundreds of additional biological differences, including five of the eight genetic regions previously identified by DecodeME. This deeper insight could advance scientific understanding of the illness.

Uncovering Biological Clues for Future Treatments

The new analysis demonstrated exceptional precision, achieving 92 percent sensitivity (correctly identifying those with ME/CFS) and 98 percent specificity (correctly identifying those without it).

Researchers also observed signs of immune system involvement and inflammation pathways, suggesting potential biological targets for future therapies. These findings may help determine which patients are most likely to benefit from specific treatments.

Toward More Accurate Diagnosis and Personalized Care

""This is a significant step forward,"" said UEA's Prof Pshezhetskiy. ""For the first time, we have a simple blood test that can reliably identify ME/CFS -- potentially transforming how we diagnose and manage this complex disease.""

""Additionally, understanding the biological pathways involved in ME/CFS opens the door to developing targeted treatments and identifying which patients might benefit most from specific therapies.

""We hope that the Episwitch® CFS test could become a vital tool in clinical settings, paving the way for more personalized and effective care.""

Notes

This research was led by UEA and Oxford BioDynamics in collaboration with The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust.

'Development and validation of blood-based diagnostic biomarkers for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) using EpiSwitch® 3-dimensional genomic regulatory immuno-genetic profiling' is published in the Journal of Translational Medicine.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Alzheimer's might be powered by a broken sleep-wake cycle","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251102205012.htm","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 06:27:07 GMT","

Alzheimer's disease often throws a person's daily patterns into disarray. Difficulty sleeping through the night, restless tossing, and frequent daytime naps are common early warning signs. In later stages, patients often experience ""sundowning,"" a period of increased confusion and agitation that tends to occur later in the day. These patterns hint at a close relationship between Alzheimer's progression and the circadian system -- the internal body clock that regulates sleep, wakefulness, and other daily biological cycles. Until recently, however, scientists did not fully understand how deeply this connection ran.

A team of researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis has now demonstrated, in mouse models, that Alzheimer's disease disrupts circadian rhythms within specific brain cells. This disturbance alters how and when hundreds of genes switch on and off, changing key processes that help the brain function properly.

Their findings, published October 23 in Nature Neuroscience, suggest that restoring or stabilizing these internal rhythms could open up a new approach to treating Alzheimer's.

""There are 82 genes that have been associated with Alzheimer's disease risk, and we found that the circadian rhythm is controlling the activity of about half of those,"" said Erik S. Musiek, MD, PhD, the Charlotte & Paul Hagemann Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine, who led the study. In mice engineered to model the disease, these genes no longer followed their usual daily patterns. ""Knowing that a lot of these Alzheimer's genes are being regulated by the circadian rhythm gives us the opportunity to find ways to identify therapeutic treatments to manipulate them and prevent the progression of the disease.""

The Burden of Sleep Disruption

Musiek, who co-directs the Center on Biological Rhythms and Sleep (COBRAS) at WashU Medicine and specializes in aging and dementia, noted that disturbed sleep is one of the most frequent problems reported by caregivers of Alzheimer's patients. His earlier work showed that sleep changes begin years before memory loss becomes evident. Beyond exhaustion for both patients and caregivers, these disruptions create stress that may accelerate the disease's progression.

Breaking this cycle, he said, starts with identifying where it begins. The body's circadian system regulates roughly 20% of all genes in the human genome, orchestrating vital processes such as digestion, immune response, and sleep-wake cycles.

In earlier research, Musiek identified a protein called YKL-40 that naturally fluctuates throughout the day and helps control normal levels of amyloid in the brain. Too much YKL-40, which is linked to Alzheimer's risk in humans, can trigger the build-up of amyloid -- a sticky protein that forms plaques, one of the hallmarks of the disease.

Amyloid's Effect on the Brain's Timing Mechanisms

Because Alzheimer's symptoms follow a repeating daily pattern, the team suspected more circadian-regulated proteins and genes might be involved. In the new study, they examined gene activity in the brains of mice that developed amyloid build-up, as well as in healthy young mice and older mice without plaques. Samples were collected every two hours over a full 24-hour period to track how gene expression changed across the circadian cycle.

The researchers found that amyloid deposits disrupted the normal rhythm of hundreds of genes in two key types of brain cells -- microglia and astrocytes. Microglia act as the brain's immune cells, clearing away waste and harmful materials, while astrocytes help neurons communicate and maintain healthy function. Many of the affected genes are normally responsible for microglia's ability to remove waste, including amyloid.

Although these genes were not entirely switched off, their usual order and timing became chaotic, weakening the brain's coordinated system for removing toxins.

New Rhythms and Potential Therapies

The study also revealed that amyloid plaques appeared to create new rhythmic patterns in genes that do not usually follow a daily cycle. Many of these genes are involved in inflammation or the brain's response to stress and imbalance.

According to Musiek, these discoveries suggest that therapies aimed at adjusting circadian rhythms in microglia and astrocytes could support healthier brain activity.

""We have a lot of things we still need to understand, but where the rubber meets the road is trying to manipulate the clock in some way, make it stronger, make it weaker or turn it off in certain cell types,"" he said. ""Ultimately, we hope to learn how to optimize the circadian system to prevent amyloid accumulation and other aspects of Alzheimer's disease.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists achieve forensics' “Holy Grail” by recovering fingerprints from fired bullets","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251102011206.htm","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 01:40:40 GMT","

Two Irish scientists have created a groundbreaking method for recovering fingerprints from fired bullet casings -- something long believed to be impossible.

Dr. Eithne Dempsey and her former PhD student, Dr. Colm McKeever, from the Department of Chemistry at Maynooth University in Ireland, have designed a novel electrochemical process that reveals fingerprints on brass casings even after exposure to the intense heat generated when a gun is fired.

Solving a Long-Standing Forensic Challenge

For decades, forensic experts have struggled to retrieve fingerprints from firearms or ammunition. The extreme temperatures, gas, and friction produced during gunfire typically destroy any biological residue. Because of this, many criminals have relied on the assumption that fired weapons and casings could not link them to a crime scene.

""The Holy Grail in forensic investigation has always been retrieving prints from fired ammunition casings,"" said Dr. Dempsey. ""Traditionally, the intense heat of firing destroys any biological residue. However, our technique has been able to reveal fingerprint ridges that would otherwise remain imperceptible.""

The research team discovered that coating brass casings with a thin layer of specially chosen materials can expose hidden fingerprint ridges. Unlike many existing forensic methods, this approach does not rely on toxic chemicals or expensive, high-powered equipment. Instead, it uses environmentally friendly polymers and requires very little energy to produce clear fingerprint images in seconds.

The process works by placing a brass casing inside an electrochemical cell filled with a chemical solution. When a low electrical voltage is applied, the chemicals are drawn toward the surface, filling the tiny gaps between fingerprint ridges and forming a distinct, high-contrast image. The result appears almost instantly.

""Using the burnt material that remains on the surface of the casing as a stencil, we can deposit specific materials in between the gaps, allowing for the visualisation,"" said Dr. McKeever.

Durable Results and New Investigative Possibilities

Tests showed that this technique also worked on samples aged up to 16 months, demonstrating remarkable durability.

The research has significant implications for criminal investigations, where the current assumption is that firing a gun eliminates fingerprint residues on casings.

""Currently, the best case of forensic analysis of ammunition casings is to match it to the gun that fired it,"" said Dr. McKeever. ""But we hope a method like this could match it back to the actual person who loaded the gun.""

The team focused specifically on brass ammunition casings, a substance that has been traditionally resistant to fingerprint detection and is the most common type of material used globally.

The researchers believe that the test for fingerprints on brass they have developed could be adapted for other metallic surfaces, expanding its range of potential forensic applications, from firearm-related crimes to arson.

This technique uses a device called a potentiostat, which controls voltage and can be as portable as a mobile phone, making it possible to create a compact forensic testing kit.

""With this method, we have turned the ammunition casing into an electrode, allowing us to drive chemical reactions at the surface of the casing,"" said Dr. McKeever.

Toward Real-World Use

Although early results are promising, the new fingerprint recovery method will need further testing and validation before it can be used by law enforcement agencies around the world. The project, supported by Research Ireland and Maynooth University, was recently published in a leading forensic science journal and represents a major step forward for global policing and criminal investigation.

Earth's oceans hold extraordinary biodiversity, yet only a small portion of an estimated two million marine species have been formally identified and described. One of the biggest hurdles in ocean science is the lengthy delay -- sometimes lasting decades -- between when a species is first discovered and when it is officially documented.

To overcome this bottleneck, researchers launched Ocean Species Discoveries, a data-rich publication platform designed for concise, high-quality marine invertebrate species descriptions. By providing a faster, more standardized system, it dramatically shortens the time needed to publish new species. This speed is essential, as many marine species face extinction due to human-driven biodiversity loss before scientists even learn they exist.

The project is coordinated by the Senckenberg Ocean Species Alliance (SOSA), part of the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum Frankfurt. SOSA's mission is to foster global cooperation, supply technical resources for species documentation, and promote efficient, transparent taxonomic publishing.

14 New Species Described in the Latest Research Collection

In the second major Ocean Species Discoveries collection, more than 20 researchers collaborated to describe 14 new marine invertebrate species and two new genera from across the globe. These included a variety of worms, mollusks, and crustaceans. The findings were published in Biodiversity Data Journal, marking a milestone one year after the project's pilot paper.

""Our shared vision is making taxonomy faster, more efficient, more accessible and more visible,"" the team said in their paper.

Many of the new discoveries were made possible through the Discovery Laboratory at the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum Frankfurt. The lab provides access to cutting-edge techniques such as light and electron microscopy, confocal imaging, molecular barcoding, and micro-CT scanning. These tools enable researchers to collect detailed, high-quality data for precise species descriptions.

The study's subjects were collected from ocean depths ranging from just 1 meter to more than 6,000 meters. Among them is Veleropilina gretchenae, a newly identified mollusk recovered from the Aleutian Trench at 6,465 meters. It is one of the first members of the class Monoplacophora to have a high-quality genome published directly from its holotype specimen.

Record-Breaking Discovery: The Carnivorous Bivalve Myonera aleutiana

A major highlight of the project is the detailed anatomical study of Myonera aleutiana, a carnivorous bivalve. This marks only the second bivalve species ever documented entirely through non-invasive micro-CT scanning. The process produced more than 2,000 tomographic images, revealing remarkable detail of the animal's soft tissue and internal structure. It is also the first in-depth anatomical description for any Myonera species and sets a new depth record -- found between 5,170 and 5,280 meters, about 800 meters deeper than any previously known specimen.

Honoring a Scientific Legacy

One of the newly described species, Apotectonia senckenbergae, was named in honor of Johanna Rebecca Senckenberg (1716-1743), a naturalist and benefactor whose support for science and medicine helped inspire the formation of the Senckenberg Society for Nature Research. The amphipod was discovered at a depth of 2,602 meters in a mussel bed within the Galápagos Rift hydrothermal vent fields.

Ocean Oddities: Popcorn Parasites and Deep-Sea Hitchhikers

Some of the newly identified animals display peculiar traits. The parasitic isopod Zeaione everta has raised structures on the female's back that resemble popped corn kernels. Its genus name, derived from Zea (the corn genus), highlights this unusual appearance. Found in the Australian intertidal zone, the isopod also represents a completely new genus.

Researchers also observed fascinating interactions among known deep-sea creatures. The tusk shell Laevidentalium wiesei, collected from depths exceeding 5,000 meters, was discovered with a sea anemone attached to its anterior (concave) side -- a relationship never before documented within this genus.

Mapping Life in the Deepest Oceans

These discoveries showcase how global collaboration and advanced imaging are transforming marine taxonomy. By accelerating how species are documented and named, scientists can better understand -- and potentially protect -- the countless forms of life still hidden in Earth's vast and mysterious oceans.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists discover the nutrient that supercharges cellular energy","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251102205014.htm","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 14:27:44 GMT","

Mitochondria are tiny structures inside cells that generate the energy required for the body to move, grow, and maintain health. Because energy needs change continuously, mitochondria must constantly fine-tune their activity to keep up. This adaptability depends in part on the nutrients available to the cell. Yet until recently, scientists did not fully understand how nutrients influence this process of energy adjustment.

A research group led by Professor Dr. Thorsten Hoppe at the University of Cologne's Institute for Genetics and the CECAD Cluster of Excellence on Aging Research has now identified a new biological pathway showing how the amino acid leucine strengthens mitochondrial performance. Their work reveals that leucine stabilizes important mitochondrial proteins, enhancing the organelle's ability to produce energy. The study, titled ""Leucine inhibits degradation of outer mitochondrial membrane proteins to adapt mitochondrial respiration,"" was published in Nature Cell Biology.

How Leucine Supports Energy Production

Leucine is one of the essential amino acids, meaning it must be obtained through food. It is a key component of protein synthesis and is abundant in protein-rich foods like meat, dairy products, and legumes such as beans and lentils. The researchers found that leucine helps protect certain proteins on the outer membrane of mitochondria from breaking down. These proteins are vital because they transport other metabolic molecules into the mitochondria to generate energy. By preserving them, leucine allows mitochondria to work more efficiently, resulting in higher energy output within the cell.

""We were thrilled to discover that a cell's nutrient status, especially its leucine levels, directly impacts energy production,"" said Dr. Qiaochu Li, the study's first author. ""This mechanism enables cells to swiftly adapt to increased energy demands during periods of nutrient abundance.""

The study also revealed that a protein called SEL1L plays an important role in this process. SEL1L is part of the cell's quality control system that identifies and removes faulty or misfolded proteins. Leucine seems to reduce the activity of SEL1L, which decreases the breakdown of mitochondrial proteins and improves mitochondrial performance. ""Modulating leucine and SEL1L levels could be a strategy to boost energy production,"" said Li. ""However, it is important to proceed with caution. SEL1L also plays a crucial role in preventing the accumulation of damaged proteins, which is essential for long-term cellular health.""

Broader Implications for Health and Disease

To explore the wider impact of their findings, the researchers studied the process in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. They discovered that problems in leucine metabolism can impair mitochondrial function and even cause fertility issues. When the team examined human lung cancer cells, they found that certain mutations affecting leucine metabolism actually help cancer cells survive, highlighting an important factor for future cancer treatment strategies.

These discoveries show that the nutrients we consume do more than simply fuel the body -- they actively influence how energy is produced inside cells. By uncovering how leucine affects mitochondrial metabolism, the study points to potential new therapeutic targets for conditions linked to reduced energy production, including cancer and metabolic disorders.

This research received support through Germany's Excellence Strategy as part of CECAD and from several Collaborative Research Centers funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Additional funding came from the European Research Council via the ERC Advanced Grant ""Cellular Strategies of Protein Quality Control-Degradation"" (CellularPQCD) and from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A “scary” new spider species found beneath California's beaches","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251102205001.htm","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:30:37 GMT","

Scientists at the University of California, Davis report the discovery of a previously unrecognized trapdoor spider that lives in California's coastal sand dunes. The species, named Aptostichus ramirezae, is closely related to Aptostichus simus, which occurs along the shoreline from Monterey to Baja California, Mexico.

Findings published in the journal Ecology and Evolution indicate that what long appeared to be a single species is actually two.

""While there are over 50,000 species of spiders worldwide, there are probably hundreds of thousands left to be discovered, even along the coast where new spider species may be hiding just underfoot of California beachgoers,"" said senior author Jason Bond, a professor in the UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology.

A hidden species revealed

Trapdoor spiders are small, secretive relatives of tarantulas. Females spend their entire lives in underground, silk-lined burrows that close with a hinged, well-camouflaged door. They wait motionless for surface vibrations, darting out only when prey strays within reach.

""There are now four known species of trapdoor spiders in California that live exclusively in coastal dune habitats,"" said corresponding author Emma Jochim, a doctoral student in the UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology. ""The one we were looking at as part of this study was the most widespread, ranging from Moss Landing near Monterey down to Baja California -- which is a pretty wide range for a trapdoor spider, given that they don't easily leave their burrows to disperse.""

To test whether look-alike spiders were masking more than one species, Jochim and colleagues examined genomic DNA from Aptostichus simus collected throughout its range. Bond had long suspected the presence of cryptic species, a term for species that appear similar but are genetically distinct.

The team considered both genetic evidence and where populations occur. Cryptic species are reproductively isolated.

""Based on what we know about their natural history and lifestyles, they're not going to be able to disperse to different coastal dunes to reproduce and 'mix' with each other,"" Jochim said.

What's in a name

Professor Jason Bond decided to name the new brown, chunky, quarter-sized spider Aptostichus ramirezae. Bond is no stranger to naming new spider species. The arachnologist has named species after celebrities, musicians, photographers and even magicians. Notables include Aptostichus stephencolberti or Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi and Aptostichus barackobamai.

This new species is named for Martina Giselle Ramirez, dean of the College of Science at California State University, Stanislaus and formerly dean of natural sciences and biology professor at St. Norbert College. Ramirez is a highly regarded arachnologist who pioneered early works on trapdoor spider population genetics and has championed underrepresented students in STEM disciplines.

More than a Halloween creature

The scariest part about this discovery isn't the spider, it's what could happen if its home is lost for good.

Both Aptostichus simus and Aptostichus ramirezae live only in coastal dunes from central California to northern Baja California, Mexico including some in the Channel Islands. These habitats are shrinking due to many factors including development, erosion, wildfire and sea-level rise.

""They're definitely at risk, especially the lineage Aptostichus simus,"" Jochim said. ""The new species has a much wider range, but Aptostichus simus is now really only found in San Diego, and projections for sea-level rise in that area are very grim. These spiders are not really able to adapt that quickly to new habitats.""

Clarifying the genetic differences among populations helps identify which groups most urgently need protection. Although spiders can seem spooky to study, Jochim noted that documenting them deepens our understanding of Earth's biodiversity.

""If we don't know how many species are in an area or understand the patterns of genetic diversity between populations, we don't really know what areas would be most important for conservation efforts,"" she said.

Other contributors to the study are James Starrett and Hanna R. Briggs of UC Davis. The work received support from the National Science Foundation.

Physical inactivity is a recognized modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet its relationship with progression of AD pathology in humans remains unclear, limiting the effective translation into prevention trials. Using pedometer-measured step counts in cognitively unimpaired older adults, we demonstrated an association between higher physical activity and slower cognitive and functional decline in individuals with elevated baseline amyloid. Importantly, this beneficial association was not related to lower amyloid burden at baseline or longitudinally. Instead, higher physical activity was associated with slower amyloid-related inferior temporal tau accumulation, which significantly mediated the association with slower cognitive decline. Dose–response analyses further revealed a curvilinear relationship, where the associations with slower tau accumulation and cognitive decline reached a plateau at a moderate level of physical activity (5,001–7,500 steps per day), potentially offering a more approachable goal for older sedentary individuals. Collectively, our findings support targeting physical inactivity as an intervention to modify the trajectory of preclinical AD in future prevention trials, and further suggest that preferentially enrolling sedentary individuals with elevated amyloid may maximize the likelihood of demonstrating a protective effect of physical activity on tau accumulation and cognitive and functional decline in early AD.

It is estimated that nearly half of AD cases worldwide are attributable to modifiable risk factors1,2,3. Physical inactivity, in particular, plays a prominent role in the USA and Europe1,2. Although animal studies support a benefit of physical activity on AD progression4,5, important knowledge gaps remain in human literature, limiting the effective translation into AD prevention trials. Most existing observational studies rely on self-reported physical activity6,7,8,9,10,11,12, which is prone to recall bias and misreporting, especially in populations with or at risk for cognitive impairment. In addition, most studies focused on the clinical syndrome of AD7,9,12,13,14, with few directly examining core AD biomarkers15,16,17,18,19,20,21, and even fewer have done so longitudinally22,23. A clearer understanding of how objectively measured physical activity is associated with the progression of AD neuropathology is essential, particularly during the preclinical period, when there is likely the greatest potential to modify disease trajectory.

With the increasing popularity of digital wearables, daily step count has become an easily accessible and understood measure of physical activity. Emerging literature suggests that higher step counts are linked to lower all-cause mortality24,25. Our previous study demonstrated that higher step counts in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults with elevated baseline beta-amyloid (Aβ) burden were associated with slower prospective cognitive decline26, supporting a potential protective role of physical activity in the preclinical stage of AD. However, it remains unknown whether this protective association with cognition is mediated by differences in AD neuropathology burden, or what levels of physical activity are associated with slower cognitive decline.

The current study addressed these questions by leveraging an expanded Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) cohort of CU older individuals with pedometer-measured physical activity, longitudinal Aβ and tau positron emission tomography (PET) data, and annual cognitive assessments up to 14 years. We examined whether physical activity is associated with slower cognitive and functional decline through different rates of Aβ and tau accumulation. We further examined the dose–response associations with physical activity levels to help inform future AD prevention trials and public health policies.

The current study examined 296 participants from HABS who were CU at baseline and followed longitudinally27. Cognition and function were assessed annually using the Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite-5 (PACC5) and Clinical Dementia Rating28 Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) scores, respectively. Global Aβ and inferior temporal cortex (ITC) tau burdens were measured longitudinally in a subset of participants (Aβ n = 241; tau n = 172), with participants undergoing their first tau scan at 2.2 ± 1.5 years after baseline because the technique was introduced mid-study. Table 1 summarizes the participant characteristics and longitudinal follow-up. The unadjusted longitudinal trajectories for global Aβ, ITC tau, PACC5 and CDR-SOB are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. For illustration purposes only, to more clearly visualize the individual trajectories, the data were plotted according to high versus low baseline Aβ burden in columns and physical activity (pedometer-measured mean steps per day) in rows, defined by above and below the median values.

We first examined the associations between physical activity and baseline demographics, imaging and cognitive variables. There was a negative association between physical activity and age (Spearman's r = −0.27, P < 0.001). Males had greater physical activity than females (Sex [males compared to females]: β = 927 [95% confidence intervals 247 to 1,607], P = 0.008). There were no significant associations between physical activity and education (rpartial = 0.08, P = 0.16), or baseline Aβ burden (rpartial = −0.004, P = 0.95), adjusting for age and sex. There was a significant interaction between lower baseline physical activity and elevated Aβ on greater initial ITC tau burden, adjusting for age, sex, years of education and time interval between study baseline and first tau scan (Physical activity × Aβ: β = −0.19 [−0.30 to −0.08], P = 0.001) (Extended Data Fig. 2). There was no additional independent association between baseline physical activity and initial ITC tau burden (Physical activity: β = −0.06 [−0.18 to 0.05], P = 0.28). Importantly, there were no interactive or independent associations of initial Aβ and tau burden with baseline physical activity, adjusting for the same covariates (Aβ × ITC tau: β = −0.04 [−0.15 to 0.07], P = 0.44; Aβ: β = 0.10 [−0.07 to 0.28], P = 0.25; ITC tau: β = 0.01 [−0.21 to 0.22], P = 0.96) (Extended Data Fig. 3). There were also no significant interactive (Physical activity × Aβ) or independent effects of physical activity on baseline PACC5 (Physical activity × Aβ: β = 0.003 [−0.07 to 0.08], P = 0.93; Physical activity: β = 0.003 [−0.07 to 0.08], P = 0.92). Baseline associations with CDR-SOB were not examined because participants were clinically unimpaired at baseline.

For primary analyses, we examined the effects of baseline physical activity on longitudinal imaging and cognitive measures. Using a linear mixed effects model, we found no association between baseline physical activity and longitudinal Aβ burden (Physical activity × Time: β = −0.0006 [−0.01 to 0.01], P = 0.92) (Fig. 1a).

a, Linear mixed effects model revealed no association between baseline physical activity and longitudinal Aβ burden (β = −0.0006 [−0.01 to 0.01], P = 0.92; n = 241). b–d, By contrast, there were significant interactions between baseline physical activity and Aβ burden on longitudinal ITC tau burden (b), longitudinal cognition measured with PACC5 (c) and longitudinal functional decline measured with CDR-SOB scores (d). Individuals with high baseline physical activity and elevated Aβ (solid red line) showed slower ITC tau accumulation (β = −0.13 [−0.19 to −0.06], P < 0.001; n = 172) (b), slower PACC5 decline (β = 0.10 [0.05 to 0.16], P < 0.001; n = 296) (c) and slower CDR-SOB progression (β = −0.14 [−0.22 to −0.05], P = 0.001; n = 296) (d). Statistical significance was assessed using two-tailed t-tests, with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Baseline physical activity (mean steps per day) and Aβ burden were modeled as continuous variables. To visualize the model results, the estimated trajectories based on representative levels of low versus high baseline physical activity and (for tau, PACC5 and CDR-SOB models) low versus high baseline Aβ burden are presented, with error bands representing 95% confidence intervals for the estimated trajectories. Low and high physical activity are represented by −1 and +1 s.d. relative to the mean (low, 2,800 steps per day; high, 8,700 steps per day). Low and high Aβ are represented, for illustration purposes, by the mean Aβ burden of Aβ-negative (PiB PVC-DVR = 1.17) and Aβ-positive (PiB PVC-DVR = 1.85) participants, respectively. The numbers of participants contributing longitudinal data to each 2.5-year segment for the respective statistical models are summarized in Extended Data Table 5.

We then examined the interactive associations between baseline physical activity and Aβ burden on longitudinal cognition and function. Baseline Aβ was modeled as a continuous variable to leverage the full dynamic range of global Aβ burden29. Consistent with our earlier work26, this larger HABS sample with extended follow-up showed a significant physical activity by Aβ interaction on longitudinal PACC5, whereby higher physical activity was associated with slower Aβ-related PACC5 decline (Physical activity × Aβ × Time: β = 0.10 [0.05 to 0.16], P < 0.001; Fig. 1c). In addition, there was an independent association between higher physical activity and slower PACC5 decline (Physical activity × Time: β = 0.06 [0.004 to 0.12], P = 0.04). We further extended our previous findings and identified a significant physical activity by Aβ interaction on longitudinal CDR-SOB, whereby higher physical activity was associated with slower Aβ-related functional decline (Physical activity × Aβ × Time: β = −0.14 [−0.22 to -0.05], P = 0.001) (Fig. 1d). There was no additional main effect of physical activity on CDR-SOB progression (Physical activity × Time: β = −0.05 [−0.13 to 0.04], P = 0.29).

We then addressed the question of whether the associations between physical activity and cognitive and functional decline were mediated by differences in tau pathology. We found a concordant interaction, whereby higher baseline physical activity was associated with attenuated Aβ-related ITC tau accumulation (Physical activity × Aβ × Time: β = −0.13 [−0.19 to −0.06], P < 0.001) (Fig. 1b). There was additionally an independent association between higher physical activity and slower tau accumulation (Physical activity × Time: β = −0.07 [−0.13 to −0.003], P = 0.04). Moderated mediation analysis demonstrated that slower ITC tau accumulation fully mediated the association between higher physical activity and slower PACC5 decline in individuals with elevated baseline Aβ (mediated effect: β = 0.59 [0.32 to 0.91], P < 0.001; direct effect: β = 0.11 [−0.30 to 0.52], P = 0.61; 84% mediated) (Fig. 2a). For CDR-SOB, slower ITC tau accumulation partially mediated the association between higher physical activity and slower CDR-SOB progression in individuals with elevated baseline Aβ (β = −0.43 [−0.71 to −0.20], P < 0.001; 40% mediated) (Fig. 2b). There remained a significant direct effect of physical activity on functional decline (β = −0.64 [−1.16 to −0.13], P = 0.01). In individuals with low baseline Aβ, there were no significant total or mediated effects of physical activity on PACC5 decline or CDR-SOB progression (P > 0.75).

a,b, Individual slopes for ITC tau, PACC5 (a) and CDR-SOB (b) were extracted from linear mixed effects models for moderated mediation analyses (n = 172; in participants who have both longitudinal tau and cognitive data). We modeled physical activity (mean steps per day) as predictor, ITC tau slope as mediator and PACC5 or CDR-SOB slopes as outcome. Both physical activity and Aβ burden were modeled as continuous variables in the mediation models. For the moderation analyses, low and high levels of Aβ burden were represented by the mean Aβ burden of Aβ-negative (PiB PVC-DVR = 1.17) and Aβ-positive (PiB PVC-DVR = 1.85) participants, respectively. Statistical testing was performed using a quasi-Bayesian Monte Carlo method based on 10,000 simulations to generate the estimates and 95% confidence intervals, with two-tailed P < 0.05 considered statistically significant without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Results demonstrated that at an elevated level of baseline Aβ burden, slower ITC tau accumulation fully mediated the association between higher physical activity and slower PACC5 decline (β = 0.59 [0.32 to 0.91], P < 0.001, 84% mediated) (a) and partially mediated the association between higher physical activity and slower CDR-SOB progression (β = −0.43 [−0.71 to −0.20], P < 0.001, 40% mediated) (b). In individuals with low baseline Aβ burden, there were no significant total or mediated effects of physical activity on PACC5 decline (total effect: β = 0.03 [−0.27 to 0.31], P = 0.85; mediated effect: β = −0.002 [−0.16 to 0.15], P = 0.98) or CDR-SOB progression (total effect: β = 0.05 [−0.28 to 0.37], P = 0.75; mediated effect: β = 0.001 [−0.11 to 0.12], P = 0.98). The error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals for the estimated mediated, direct and total effects.

The interaction between baseline physical activity and Aβ on longitudinal tau, PACC5 and CDR-SOB remained significant in sensitivity analyses assessing for possible confounds (Table 2): (1) using a more stringent physical activity cutoff excluding days that registered fewer than 1,000 steps; (2) using Aβ and tau PET data without partial volume correction (PVC); (3) including only participants age <70 years to minimize potential confounding effects of advanced age (the negative association between physical activity and age was absent in this age <70 subgroup; Spearman's r = −0.01, P = 0.93); (4) adjusting for the season of physical activity measurement, self-reported physical activity, systemic vascular risk and depressive symptoms; (5) excluding participants who developed mild cognitive impairment or dropped out of the study within the first 2 years of follow-up; and (6) adjusting for baseline tau, PACC or CDR-SOB in their respective models to account for physical activity effects on baseline outcome measures.

Lastly, we examined the dose–response associations between levels of physical activity and longitudinal tau accumulation, cognitive and functional decline. Ordinal levels of physical activity were defined using cutoffs adapted from ref. 30, which were modified to better suit the lower activity levels in older adults and to ensure an adequate number of participants in each subgroup (Extended Data Table 1): ‘inactive' (≤3,000 per day), ‘low activity' (3,001–5,000 steps per day), ‘moderate activity' (5,001–7,500 steps per day) and ‘active' (≥7,501 steps per day). Participant characteristics across physical activity levels are summarized in Extended Data Table 2. Higher physical activity levels were associated with younger age, but baseline demographics, imaging and cognitive variables were not significantly different across physical activity groups adjusting for age and sex. In linear mixed effects models using the inactive subgroup as reference, all higher levels of physical activity were associated with slower Aβ-related ITC tau accumulation, PACC5 decline and CDR-SOB progression, except that the slower CDR-SOB progression in the low activity group did not reach statistical significance (Table 3). To better visualize the dose–response relationships, we modeled the physical activity level by Aβ interaction on extracted ITC tau, PACC5 and CDR-SOB slopes (Fig. 3). In individuals with elevated baseline Aβ, even low levels of physical activity (3,001–5,000 steps per day) were associated with substantially slower rates of tau accumulation, cognitive and functional decline. There were further attenuations of tau accumulation and cognitive and functional decline at moderate activity (5,001–7,500 steps per day), with similar rates in the active group (≥7,501 steps per day), suggesting a plateauing of effects.

a–c, Using extracted slopes for ITC tau (n = 172) (a), PACC5 (b) and CDR-SOB (c) (PACC5 and CDR-SOB, n = 296), we examined the interactive effects of baseline physical activity level (ordinal) and Aβ burden (continuous) using linear regression models. Levels of physical activity (ordinal) were defined as inactive (≤3,000 steps), low activity (3,001–5,000 steps), moderate activity (5,001–7,500 steps) and active (≥7,501 steps). The number of individuals in each physical activity subgroup included in the tau, PACC5 and CDR-SOB analyses are summarized in Extended Data Table 1. Aβ burden was modeled as a continuous variable. For illustration purposes, low and high Aβ are represented by the mean Aβ burden of Aβ-negative (PiB PVC-DVR = 1.17) and Aβ-positive (PiB PVC-DVR = 1.85) participants, respectively. The error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals for the estimated effects of physical activity levels on tau and cognitive slopes at representative levels of low and high Aβ burden. Results demonstrate that in individuals with elevated baseline Aβ, even low levels of physical activity (3,001–5,000 steps) were associated with substantially slower rates of tau accumulation and cognitive decline compared to inactive individuals. There were further attenuations of tau accumulation and cognitive and functional decline at moderate activity (5,001–7,500 steps per day), with similar rates in the active group (≥7,501 steps per day).

To help contextualize the associations between physical activity levels and cognitive and functional decline, we used the linear mixed effects models from Table 3 to estimate the longitudinal PACC5 and CDR-SOB trajectories at representative levels of low versus high baseline Aβ burden (represented by the mean global Aβ burden of Aβ-negative and Aβ-positive participants, respectively) across physical activity levels (Extended Data Fig. 4). For individuals with elevated Aβ, from baseline to the median cognitive follow-up of 9 years, estimated PACC5 z-scores declined by 2.5 (inactive), 1.5 (low activity), 1.1 (moderate activity) and 1.2 (active) points, respectively. Compared to inactive individuals, cognitive decline was lower by 40%, 54% and 51% across increasing physical activity levels. Over the same period, estimated CDR-SOB scores increased by 2.2 (inactive), 1.4 (low activity), 1.2 (moderate activity) and 1.1 (active) points in individuals with elevated Aβ. Compared to inactivity, there were 34%, 45% and 51% slower functional decline across increasing physical activity levels. Using −1.5 PACC5 z-score as a threshold for impaired cognition31, CU individuals with elevated Aβ were estimated to reach this threshold for cognitive worsening at 6.5 (inactive), 9.6 (low activity), 13.6 (moderate activity) and 12.7 (active) years from baseline, respectively. Similarly, using a CDR-SOB increase of 1.5 as a threshold for clinically meaningful functional decline in early AD32, individuals with elevated Aβ were estimated to reach this threshold at 7.1 (inactive), 10.2 (low activity), 11.9 (moderate activity) and 13.6 (active) years from baseline, respectively.

In an expanded cohort of 296 CU older adults with pedometer-measured physical activity, baseline Aβ PET and up to 14 years of annual cognitive follow-up, we replicated our previous finding of a protective association between higher physical activity and slower Aβ-related cognitive decline, and further demonstrated a similar relationship with functional decline. Importantly, we demonstrated that these associations with cognition and function were not related to differences in cross-sectional or longitudinal Aβ pathology. Instead, in a subset of 172 individuals with longitudinal tau PET, we found a new and concordant association between higher physical activity and slower Aβ-related early neocortical tau accumulation, which significantly mediated the relationships with slower cognitive and functional decline. Our dose–response analyses further suggest that the largest incremental differences between increasing physical activity levels were observed in the most sedentary individuals, with plateauing associations with both tau and cognition at a moderate level of activity (5,001–7,500 steps per day), potentially offering a more approachable physical activity goal for older sedentary individuals. Collectively, our results support targeting physical inactivity, either alone or in combination with anti-Aβ therapy, as an intervention in future prevention trials to slow the progression of tau pathology and delay the onset of cognitive and functional decline in preclinical AD.

Many observational studies have demonstrated associations between physical activity and reduced risks of cognitive impairment and AD. However, most existing literature relied on self-reported physical activity, which is susceptible to recall bias or misreporting, especially among populations with or at risk for cognitive impairment. A few longitudinal studies have examined the effects of objectively measured physical activity (by pedometer or accelerometer) in older adults without dementia and found associations with reduced risks of cognitive decline, AD or all-cause dementia13,33,34,35. Our previous study26 extended these findings to CU individuals and demonstrated an association between higher step counts and slower prospective cognitive decline in preclinical AD. The current study replicated this finding using a considerably larger cohort, including younger individuals in late midlife, and over a substantially longer duration of follow-up (median of 9.3 years instead of 6 years). The latter is notable given that some observational studies found diminished benefits of physical activity with longer follow-up time36,37,38. We further expanded our cognitive findings and demonstrated a similar association with slower Aβ-related functional decline measured by CDR-SOB, which has been frequently used as an outcome measure in AD clinical trials39,40.

There is growing interest in understanding whether physical activity associations with reduced cognitive decline are mediated by differences in AD neuropathology, with most studies focusing on Aβ. Although animal models suggest that physical exercise may reduce Aβ burden4,41, evidence in human studies has been mixed. A few cross-sectional studies found associations between higher self-reported physical activity and lower Aβ pathology15,16,17,18,19,20. Other large CU cohort studies have found no associations between self-reported physical activity and cross-sectional or longitudinal Aβ PET burden21,22,23. Consistent with the latter, our study found no associations between pedometer-measured physical activity and baseline or longitudinal Aβ burden, suggesting that our findings were unlikely to be driven by different rates of Aβ accumulation.

By contrast, we demonstrated a new relationship between physical activity and longitudinal tau burden, where higher step counts were associated with slower early neocortical tau accumulation in individuals with elevated baseline Aβ. We further demonstrated that reduced tau accumulation significantly mediated the associations between higher physical activity and slower cognitive decline in preclinical AD. These observational findings support a potential role for physical activity in modifying the AD pathological cascade, which remains to be confirmed in future randomized clinical trials. Interestingly, although tau change fully mediated the effects of PACC5 decline (84% mediated), it only partially mediated (40%) the effects on CDR-SOB progression, with a significant remaining direct effect. This suggests that a substantial portion of the physical activity association with slower functional decline was mediated by mechanisms besides tau-related injury, which should be further examined in future studies (for example, physical frailty and functional reserve).

A small number of prior studies have investigated the cross-sectional associations between physical activity and tau. A few have found associations between higher physical activity and lower cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau or phosphorylated tau to Aβ42 ratios19,20,42,43. Others have examined the cross-sectional relationships between self-reported physical activity and tau PET with mixed results. Two studies found that higher self-reported physical activity was associated with lower cross-sectional tau burden44,45. However, a larger study of CU individuals found no cross-sectional associations between self-reported physical activity and regional tau burden and no significant mediation of physical activity effects on cross-sectional cognition by tau21. It is likely that our use of objectively measured physical activity and, more importantly, our longitudinal design increased our sensitivity to detect a relationship between physical activity and early aggregated tau pathology in preclinical AD.

Although our rich longitudinal PET and cognitive data are a substantial strength, this study remains observational, and we are unable to rule out potential reverse causality (that is, individuals with prodromal AD may have reduced physical activity from their underlying disease). However, several factors reduce this likelihood. First, there were no associations between physical activity (independently or interactively with Aβ) and baseline cognition. Although there was a physical activity and Aβ interaction on baseline tau burden, a reversed relationship was not observed—higher cross-sectional Aβ or tau burden (individually or interactively) was not associated with lower baseline physical activity. In addition, the association between higher physical activity and slower longitudinal ITC tau accumulation remained significant after adjusting for the effects of lower initial tau burden. Our findings were further unchanged in sensitivity analyses that excluded participants who developed mild cognitive impairment (or dropped out) within the first 2 years of follow-up, reducing the likelihood that our findings were driven by individuals with impending cognitive and/or clinical changes. Although these observations are reassuring, it is important to emphasize that randomized clinical trials are ultimately needed to establish causal relationships between physical activity and preclinical AD progression.

There is substantial public interest in understanding how much physical activity is needed to improve health. Although this question cannot be directly answered by observational studies, we examined the dose–response associations between physical activity levels and progression of tau and cognitive decline, which may help inform the design of future AD prevention trials. Our results suggest that even a modest increase in physical activity may be associated with attenuated tau accumulation and cognitive decline in sedentary individuals on a preclinical AD trajectory: compared to inactive individuals, low levels of physical activity were associated with 34% to 40% slower cognitive and functional decline over 9 years (the median duration of cognitive follow-up). Notably, the associations with more favorable tau and cognitive trajectories reached a plateau by moderate levels of physical activity (5,001–7,500 steps per day), which may be a less daunting goal for sedentary older adults than the popular goal of 10,000 steps per day commonly referenced in lay media. Several studies have demonstrated a similar curvilinear relationship between step count and all-cause mortality or dementia24,25,34, with benefits plateauing around 6,000–8,000 steps per day for older adults and around 8,000–10,000 steps per day for younger populations, suggesting a ceiling effect. Specifically for the current study, our findings suggest that there may be a limit to how much increasing physical activity may dampen the detrimental effects of Aβ on tau and cognitive and functional decline, and support designing clinical trials that combine lifestyle interventions with anti-Aβ therapy to more effectively modify the trajectory of preclinical AD.

Future studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of physical activity on Aβ-related tau pathology and cognitive decline. Although adjusting for composite vascular risk did not impact our findings, better vascular fitness remains a likely potential mechanism. Greater physical activity has been linked to better cardiopulmonary fitness46,47, which has, in turn, been shown to dampen the negative association between Aβ and cognition48. In addition, greater accelerometer physical activity in CU older adults has been associated with greater cerebral blood flow49, which has been shown to be impaired early in the AD cascade50. Lastly, greater physical activity and/or exercise have also been shown in animal models and humans to decrease inflammation and upregulate VEGF-A, BDNF and Irisin51,52,53,54,55, which are candidate pathways with the potential to modulate Aβ effects on tau and cognition56,57,58,59,60.

The current study has several limitations. As discussed above in greater detail, this is an observational study and we are unable to fully rule out the potential influence of reverse causality. Future randomized clinical trials are required to establish causal relationships. Although our pedometer-measured physical activity is a strength, it was only assessed at baseline and did not classify the duration, intensity or history of physical activity, nor capture nonstep-related physical activity (for example, swimming, resistance training). Future studies with longitudinal physical activity measurements (for example, with actigraphy) and life course physical activity data are needed to better delineate temporal trends. The HABS cohort consists of highly educated, predominantly non-Hispanic white individuals and excluded those with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease and poorly controlled vascular risk factors at baseline, which may limit the generalizability of our findings to other populations.

In summary, leveraging a deeply phenotyped CU cohort with objectively measured physical activity and longitudinal neuroimaging and cognitive assessments, we demonstrated an association between higher physical activity and attenuated accumulation of early neocortical tau pathology, which significantly mediated the relationship with slower cognitive and functional decline in preclinical AD. Our dose–response analyses further suggest that the incremental differences in associations between higher physical activity levels and slower tau and cognitive changes were greatest for the most sedentary individuals, and appeared to reach a plateau by moderate levels of physical activity (5,001–7,500 steps per day). Taken together, our findings support targeting physical inactivity as a strategy in future randomized clinical trials to modify the trajectory of tau and cognition in preclinical AD, and potentially provide an easily understood and more attainable physical activity goal for older sedentary individuals at high risk of cognitive decline. Our results further suggest that AD prevention trials using activity-based interventions may benefit from preferentially enrolling sedentary individuals with elevated Aβ levels, longer trial durations, and consideration of examining biomarker endpoint with tau PET, because these approaches may maximize the likelihood of demonstrating a protective effect of physical activity on early AD progression.

The current study included 296 participants from HABS27, a community cohort of individuals aged 50 to 90 who were CU at baseline (global CDR28 of 0, education-adjusted Mini-Mental State Examination61 score of 27 or greater, and Logical Memory IIa Delayed Recall performance in the normal range62). Inclusion and exclusion criteria and study protocol have been detailed previously27 and published online (https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn53910452/wiki/631007). We examined all eligible participants with baseline physical activity measurement, Aβ PET imaging and at least two longitudinal cognitive assessments. Extended Data Fig. 5 illustrates that of 348 eligible HABS participants at baseline, 50 were excluded from the current study because of missing data. Importantly, the included group did not differ in demographics or baseline cognition (Extended Data Table 3). Baseline characteristics by self-reported sex are summarized in Extended Data Table 4. Additional subsets of participants were used in the longitudinal Aβ PET (n = 241) and tau PET (n = 172) analyses (Table 1). Data were collected from April 2010 to February 2025. The Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board approved the HABS protocol and procedures, and all participants signed a written informed consent before the completion of any study procedures.

Baseline physical activity was measured using a waistband-mounted pedometer (HJ-720ITC; Omron Healthcare), which has been shown to accurately measure step counts63. Participants were asked to wear the pedometer for seven consecutive days during waking hours. Using previously published cutoffs for pedometer data quality, days that registered <100 or >30,000 steps were excluded26,64. We included participants with at least 4 days of recorded activity within these cutoffs64. Mean steps per day were used as the primary measure of physical activity, which was square-root transformed to account for skewness.

Detailed methods have been published previously65. Briefly, global Aβ burden was measured using PiB PET as a DVR across a composite of frontal, lateral temporal and parietal, and retrosplenial regional uptake defined using FreeSurfer (v.6.0). 18F-Flortaucipir PET was introduced mid-study to measure tau, with participants undergoing their first 18F-flortaucipir PET at 2.2 ± 1.5 years after baseline. Tau was measured as standardized uptake value ratio in the ITC, a prominent site of early neocortical tau accumulation in preclinical AD associated with emerging cognitive impairment65. Both Aβ and tau PET used cerebellar gray matter as reference and the geometric transfer matrix method for PVC66. Sensitivity analyses were performed using PET data without PVC.

Cognition was assessed using the PACC5 (ref. 67), a composite z-score that includes the Mini-Mental State Examination61, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Digit Symbol Coding68, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory delayed recall62, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (free recall plus total recall)69 and Category Fluency Test70. Functional decline was assessed using the CDR-SOB score.

We used R v.4.3.1. Continuous variables were z-transformed before analysis to obtain standardized effect sizes, with the exception of PACC5 (already a z-score). For illustrative purposes, nonstandardized variables were used when plotting model results to enhance interpretability (‘ggplot2' and ‘plot_model' packages). A two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

We first examined the associations between baseline physical activity with age and sex. We also examined the associations between physical activity and baseline imaging and cognitive variables, adjusting for age and sex.

For primary analyses, we used linear mixed effects model (‘nlme' package) to examine: (1) the effects of physical activity on longitudinal Aβ; and (2) the interactive effects of physical activity and baseline Aβ on longitudinal ITC tau, PACC5 and CDR-SOB, respectively. Baseline Aβ was modeled as a continuous variable to leverage the full dynamic range of Aβ burden, which has been shown to capture additional information on preclinical AD progression over a dichotomous approach and avoids variability introduced by positivity threshold selection, which remains an evolving area of research29. Time was operationalized as years from baseline assessment. We adjusted for age, sex, APOE ε4 carrier status, education, their interactions with time, and included random intercepts and slopes. There were no significant APOE ε4 effects on longitudinal tau, PACC5 or CDR-SOB; therefore, APOE was removed from these models to include three participants with missing genotype data.

We conducted the following sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of our primary findings: (1) using a more stringent physical activity cutoff excluding days that registered <1,000 steps; (2) using PET data without PVC; (3) including only participants age <70 years to minimize potential confounding effects of advanced age; (4) adjusting for additional potential confounders and their interactions with time—season of physical activity measurement, total self-reported physical activity (CHAMPS questionnaire71), systemic vascular risk (office-based Framingham Heart Study cardiovascular disease risk score72) and depressive symptoms (geriatric depression scale); (5) excluding participants who developed mild cognitive impairment (n = 5) or dropped out (n = 11) within the first 2 years of follow-up to reduce the potential for reverse causality; and (6) adjusting for baseline tau, PACC or CDR-SOB in their respective models to account for physical activity effects on baseline outcome measures.

We further used moderated mediation analysis (‘mediation' package73) to examine whether tau accumulation mediated the interactive effects of physical activity and Aβ on PACC5 decline or CDR-SOB progression. Individual slopes of ITC tau, PACC5 and CDR-SOB change were extracted from unadjusted linear mixed models with time as the only predictor, including both random slopes and intercepts. We conducted moderated mediation analysis with PACC5 or CDR-SOB slope as outcome, ITC tau slope as mediator, baseline Aβ (continuous) as moderator, and adjusted for age, sex, education and time interval between baseline Aβ and first tau scan. To examine for moderation effects by baseline Aβ, mediation models were run at both low and high levels of baseline Aβ, which were represented by the mean Aβ burden of Aβ-negative (PiB PVC-DVR = 1.17) and Aβ-positive (PiB PVC-DVR = 1.85) participants respectively, defined using the conventional Aβ-positivity threshold (PiB PVC-DVR = 1.324). Statistical testing was performed using a quasi-Bayesian Monte Carlo method based on 10,000 simulations to generate the estimates and 95% confidence intervals.

Lastly, we examined the dose–response relationships between the levels of physical activity and associations with Aβ-related tau accumulation and cognitive decline. Ordinal levels of physical activity were defined using cutoffs adapted from ref. 30: inactive (≤3,000 steps per day), low activity (3,001 to 5,000 steps per day), moderate activity (5,001 to 7,500 steps per day) and active (≥7,501 steps per day). Using linear mixed effects models, we examined the interactive effects of baseline physical activity levels (ordinal) and Aβ (continuous) on longitudinal ITC tau, PACC5 and CDR-SOB, adjusting for the same covariates. To contextualize the effects of physical activity on cognitive decline, we used the model results to estimate predicted PACC5 and CDR-SOB trajectories across physical activity levels at representative levels of low versus high baseline Aβ burden, which were represented by the mean global Aβ burden of Aβ-negative (PiB PVC-DVR = 1.17) and Aβ-positive participants (PiB PVC-DVR = 1.85) respectively as described above. We calculated the predicted changes in PACC5 and CDR-SOB scores from baseline to year 9 (median duration of cognitive follow-up) and calculated the percent difference in decline across higher activity levels compared to inactive individuals. Lastly, we used literature-derived thresholds for cognitive impairment (lower than −1.5 PACC5 z-score31) and clinically meaningful functional decline in early AD (increase of 1.5 points on CDR-SOB32) to estimate the time from baseline to these thresholds of cognitive and functional worsening for individuals with elevated Aβ across physical activity levels.

Individual trajectories of (a) global Aβ, (b) inferior temporal cortex (ITC) tau, (c) Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite-5 (PACC5) scores, and d) Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) scores from all participants are shown without adjustment for any covariates. To allow clear visualization of the individual trajectories, participants were plotted according to high versus low baseline Aβ burden in columns and physical activity (mean steps per day) in rows, defined by above and below the median values. The trajectories are color coded by baseline Aβ burden according to the color bar, with each line representing one participant. The number of participants represented in each facet is provided for reference. The time of baseline PiB PET was used as the study baseline (time = 0). Timing of the first tau PET scan varied across participants (2.2 ± 1.5 years), as tau PET was introduced mid-study when it became available. Aβ = beta-amyloid; DVR = distribution volume ratio; PVC = partial volume correction; PiB = Pittsburgh compound-B; SUVR = standardized uptake value ratio.

Linear regression model revealed a significant interaction between baseline physical activity and Aβ burden on initial inferior temporal cortex (ITC) tau burden (Physical activity*Aβ: β = -0.19 [-0.30 to -0.08], p = 0.001), adjusting for age, sex, years of education, and time interval between study baseline and first tau scan. There was no significant independent effect of physical activity on tau (Physical activity: β = -0.06 [-0.18 to 0.05], p = 0.28). Statistical significance was assessed using two-tailed t-tests, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Physical activity (mean steps per day) was square-root transformed prior to model entry to account for skewness with improvement in model fit (reduced BIC by 2.2). Non-transformed mean steps per day was used to plot the model result to enhance interpretability. Baseline Aβ burden was modeled as a continuous variable. To visualize the model results, the estimated ITC tau burden across the range of baseline physical activity at representative levels of low versus high baseline Aβ burden are presented. Error bands represent the 95% confidence intervals for the estimated tau burden. Low and high Aβ are represented, for illustration purposes, by the mean Aβ burden of Aβ-negative (PiB PVC-DVR 1.17) and Aβ-positive (PiB PVC-DVR 1.85) participants respectively. Aβ = beta-amyloid; DVR = distribution volume ratio; ITC = inferior temporal cortex; PVC = partial volume correction; SUVR = standardized uptake value ratio.

Linear regression model revealed no significant interaction between cross-sectional Aβ and ITC tau burdens on baseline physical activity (Aβ*ITC tau: β = -0.04 [-0.15 to -0.07], p = 0.44), adjusting for age, sex, years of education, and time interval between study baseline and first tau scan. There were further no significant independent effects of Aβ or ITC tau on baseline physical activity (Aβ: β = 0.10 [-0.07 to 0.28], t = 1.16, p = 0.25; ITC tau: β = 0.01 [-0.21 to 0.22], p = 0.96). Statistical significance was assessed using two-tailed t-tests, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Physical activity (mean steps per day) was square-root transformed prior to model entry, but non-transformed mean steps per day was used to plot the model result to enhance interpretability. Baseline Aβ burden was modeled as a continuous variable. To visualize the model results, the estimated means steps per day across the range of initial ITC tau burden at representative levels of low versus high baseline Aβ burden are presented. Error bands represent the 95% confidence intervals for the estimated mean steps per day. Low and high Aβ are represented, for illustration purposes, by the mean Aβ burden of Aβ-negative (PiB PVC-DVR 1.17) and Aβ-positive (PiB PVC-DVR 1.85) participants respectively. Aβ = beta-amyloid; DVR = distribution volume ratio; ITC = inferior temporal cortex; PVC = partial volume correction; SUVR = standardized uptake value ratio.

Linear mixed effects models revealed interaction between baseline physical activity levels (ordinal) and Aβ burden (continuous) on longitudinal PACC5 decline and CDR-SOB progression. Using the inactive subgroup as reference, all higher levels of physical activity were associated with slower Aβ-related PACC5 decline and CDR-SOB progression, except the slower CDR-SOB progression in the low activity group did not reach statistical significance (Table 3). To visualize the model results, the estimated trajectories based on representative levels of low versus high baseline Aβ burden across physical activity levels are presented, with error bands representing 95% confidence intervals for the estimated trajectories. Low and high Aβ are represented, for illustration purposes, by the mean Aβ burden of Aβ-negative (PiB PVC-DVR 1.17) and Aβ-positive (PiB PVC-DVR 1.85) participants respectively, defined using the conventional Aβ-positivity threshold (PiB PVC-DVR of 1.324). The horizontal dotted line represents thresholds for cognitive impairment (-1.5 PACC5 z-score) and functional decline (1.5 points on CDR-SOB). The vertical dot-dash line represents median duration of cognitive follow-up (9 years). Aβ = β-amyloid; DVR = distribution volume ratio; PiB = Pittsburgh compound-B; PVC = partial volume corrected; SUVR = standardized uptake value ratio.

Understanding and predicting marine-terminating glacier instability presents one of the greatest challenges to forecasting future sea level rise. An extreme case of such instability is the Hektoria Glacier on the Eastern Antarctic Peninsula, which retreated ~25 km between January 2022 and March 2023. Here we investigate the dynamics and drivers of this retreat event primarily from analysis of geophysical data and satellite imagery. We find that retreat commenced immediately after the loss of decade-old fast ice in the Larsen B embayment and was associated with an almost 6-fold increase in flow speed and 40-fold increase in glacier thinning, relative to the period immediately before the fast ice loss. We also find that in November–December 2022, the glacier retreated a total of 8.2 ± 0.2 km in two months—a retreat rate nearly an order of magnitude faster than published values—and began with a transition from tabular iceberg calving to buoyancy-driven calving on an ice plain, a flat area where the glacier was only lightly grounded. Hence we conclude that in this case, retreat primarily resulted from an ice plain calving process, rather than atmospheric or oceanic conditions as suggested previously. This implies that marine-terminating glaciers with ice plain bed geometry can be easily destabilized.

Ochwat et al.1 show a speed increase in Green Glacier of 500 m yr−1 to 1150 m yr−1 by January 2023, and here we show the speed has continued to increase to 1700 m yr−1 by December 2023 (measured at 7500 m distance along track), representing ~3.5-fold increase in speed since the loss of the fast ice. At 11 km upstream of the Green Glacier terminus the glacier flow speed has yet to be affected by the loss of the fast ice and new calving regime. Green Glacier underwent similar phases of change as Hektoria, yet only retreated 4.5 km of grounded ice through austral winter 2023. Since then, Green Glacier has undergone several periods of minimal advancement and subsequent retreat of up to 2 km until April 2024 and is still actively calving and retreating.

Complex de novo structural variants (dnSVs) are crucial genetic factors in rare disorders, yet their prevalence and characteristics in rare disorders remain poorly understood. Here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of whole-genome sequencing data of 12,568 families, including 13,698 offspring with rare diseases, obtained as part of the UK 100,000 Genomes Project. We identify 1,870 dnSVs, constituting the largest dnSV dataset reported to date. Complex dnSVs (n = 158; 8.4%) emerge as the third most common type of SV, following simple deletions and duplications. We classify 65% of these complex dnSVs into 11 subtypes. Among probands with dnSVs (n = 1,696), 9% exhibit exon-disrupting pathogenic dnSVs associated with the probands' phenotype. Notably, 12% of exon-disrupting pathogenic dnSVs and 22% of de novo deletions or duplications previously identified by array-based or whole-exome sequencing methods are found to be complex dnSVs. We also find distinct genomic properties of de novo deletions depending on the parent of origin. This study highlights the importance of complex dnSVs in the cause of rare disorders and demonstrates the necessity of specific genomic analysis to avoid overlooking these variants.

Structural variants (SVs), defined as genetic changes \(\ge\)50 bp that encompass copy number variants (CNVs)1, rearrangements, and mobile element insertions, play an important role in cancer when occurring in somatic cells2. They also arise in the germline, with de novo structural variants (dnSVs) contributing to rare disorders3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. For instance, chromosomal microarray (CMA), which is capable of detecting submicroscopic CNVs, demonstrated an average diagnostic yield of 12.2% in patients with developmental and intellectual disorders11. Beyond CNVs, other types of SVs, such as complex SVs involving clustered breakpoints originating from a single event3,12, have provided insights into the genetic aetiology of rare disorders13,14,15, surpassing the explanatory power of CNVs alone. Nevertheless, in contrast to de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), there is limited information on the prevalence and characteristics of dnSVs, particularly complex rearrangements, in rare disorders, primarily due to the substantial technical challenges associated with their detection16.

One prominent difficulty arises from the inherent limitations of short-read technologies in accurately capturing and characterising large-scale genomic rearrangements. The restricted read lengths often result in fragmented or incomplete representations of complex structural variations, leading to difficulties in assembling the complete picture of genomic architecture. This issue is particularly pronounced in regions with high sequence similarity, where distinguishing between homologous sequences presents significant computational and analytical challenges.

Long-read sequencing mitigates the challenges associated with short-read platforms by offering a more direct span across SVs, thereby enabling better resolution and a more complete representation of complex genomic variations. While long-read sequencing offers unique advantages in studying SVs, the lack of substantial long-read sequence datasets from rare disorder cohorts highlights the ongoing importance of precise short-read based SV analytical pipelines17,18,19. These pipelines, essential for detecting a broad spectrum of SVs and reducing false positives. This is particularly pertinent in the absence of large cohort population datasets, which hampers accurate filtering and necessitates robust short-read analytical approaches20. Consequently, leveraging large-scale short-read sequence datasets with rigorous analytical approaches remains key for a nuanced understanding of SVs in diseases, particularly rare disorders.

To shed light on their significance in rare diseases, we analysed dnSVs identified in 13,702 whole-genome-sequenced parent–child trios from 12,568 families from the rare disease programme of the 100,000 Genomes Project (Supplementary Data 1)21 using rigorous analytical approaches. The rare disease cohort encompasses individuals with a broad spectrum of conditions, with neurology and neurodevelopmental (NN) disorders making up half of the cohort. Other represented disorders include ultra-rare conditions, ophthalmological, renal and urinary tract, cardiovascular, endocrine, and additional disease groups (Supplementary Fig. 1a).

We developed a rigorous pipeline to analyse an average of 13,980 candidate variants (standard deviation = 2550) per proband, already called by Genomic England using the Manta caller22. We identified a total of 1870 high-confidence dnSVs (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 2), all of which were visually inspected (“Methods”). Some of these dnSVs were validated using previously identified dnSVs detected in independent sequencing data from overlapping family cohorts. The validation rate was 100% (n = 44): 37 candidate dnSVs were confirmed by array/whole-exome sequencing from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD)23 study and 7 candidate dnSVs were confirmed using long-read sequencing data from Genomic England (GEL)21, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition, we validated 11 pathogenic dnSVs (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3) using RNA-seq data by confirming abnormal RNA reads supporting dnSVs (Supplementary Fig. 3a), underexpression (Fig. 2g), and Supplementary Fig. 3b), or aberrant splicing patterns (Supplementary Fig. 3c).

Using 1870 high-confidence dnSVs from 1696 probands (91% of probands had a single SV; Supplementary Fig. 1b), we estimated an overall mutation rate of 0.13 events per genome per generation, in line with previous reports24,25,26 (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The rate of dnSVs varies across the rare disorder categories; such that probands with NN disorders and those with cardiovascular disorders exhibit the highest dnSV rate (0.15 event per genome), whereas probands with ophthalmological and hearing and ear disorders show the lowest (0.1 event per genome; Supplementary Fig. 4b). It is worth noting that the rate of dnSVs is marginally higher in the probands (0.13 event per genome) than in unaffected siblings (n = 207; 0.09 event per genome; P = 0.05). Approximately 12% (n = 1696) of the probands harboured at least one dnSVs. We identified 4 individuals with a considerably higher number of dnSVs (n \(\ge\) 4). These individuals, recruited under different rare disease categories, are not among the previously reported germline SNV hypermutators27 and have no known history of parental exposure to chemotherapy. Unlike the known multiple dnCNVs phenomenon that shows a predominance of copy number gain28,29, 88% of the identified dnSVs in these individuals were a deletion (median = 1.5 kb), suggesting that further investigation is needed to characterise the multiple dnSVs in these individuals. We found a statistically significant positive correlation between the number of dnSVs and de novo SNVs/indels (P = 3.87E-07; Supplementary Fig. 5a), which is partly explained by the parental age effect26,30. However, the mechanistic basis of this correlation remains unclear.

Interestingly, we observed a greater enrichment of dnSVs in probands without diagnostic SNVs/indels compared to those with diagnostic SNVs/indels (P < 5.00E-02; Fig. 1a), suggesting that a significant proportion of unsolved cases is likely to be explained by dnSVs. We also found a parental-age effect on the occurrence of dnSVs (Fig. 1b, P_paternal < 5.00E-02 and P_maternal < 1.00E-02). Overall, we identified a significant increase in parental age at birth in probands with dnSVs compared to those without (P < 5.00E-02). Among the rare disorder classes, a significant difference in parental age distribution is observed in dysmorphic and congenital abnormality syndromes and skeletal disorders (P < 5.00E-02), while only the association with skeletal disorders remained significant after multiple testing correction (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 5b). Additionally, we observed 67.8% of the phased dnSVs originated from paternal germ cells (Supplementary Fig. 5c), as a proportion consistent with previous studies on structural variation (66–74.4%)25,26. This finding aligns with the well-documented paternal bias in de novo SNVs and indels, reinforcing the broader trend of increased germline mutagenesis in the male lineage31.

Among the different classes of dnSVs (Fig. 1c), simple deletion (n = 1377; 73.6%) was the most common, followed by tandem duplication (n = 245; 13.1%). The median detected deletion and tandem duplication sizes are 3.7 kb (range 52 bp − 61 Mb) and 49 kb (range 135 bp − 154 Mb), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Furthermore, we identified other classes such as complex SVs (n = 158; 8.4%), reciprocal inversion (n = 49; 2.6%; Fig. 2a), reciprocal translocation (n = 30; 1.6%; Fig. 2b), and templated insertion (n = 6; 0.7%; Fig. 2c). The representative probands with simple SVs disrupting phenotype-relevant genes are shown in Fig. 2a–c. For example, we identified a templated insertion that disrupted MECP2, which has a well-established function in neurodevelopment32 in probands with NN disorders. This gene is known to be recurrently affected by dnSVs10 (Fig. 2c). This was independently validated by long-read sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 2b).

We inferred the timing of maternally derived duplication formation into meiosis I and II based on the fact that heterologous allele duplications are known to occur only before the separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I. In contrast, homologous allele duplications are known to occur before the separation of sister chromatids during meiosis II33. We identified 41 cases of dnSVs with duplications, which comprise 30 tandem duplications and 11 complex SVs (median = 380 kb; range 38 kb – 40 Mb), for timing analysis. We classified the timing of duplication of maternal origin into meiosis I and II (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 6). This classification revealed that 85% of duplications in this cohort originated from maternal meiosis II (P = 4.87E-06; Fig. 1d). Further investigations using larger cohorts are required to confirm which step of meiosis contributes more significantly to dnSVs33,34.

Notably, the third most common type of dnSVs is complex SVs. We further classified complex SVs into nine major classes (Fig. 1e). The most common class, termed ‘Loss-Loss' (n = 18;11.4%), comprised two adjacent deletions (Fig. 2d). For instance, the two adjacent deletions (2 kb and 3 kb in length) in a proband with an NN disorder affected two exons in CNOT2 (Fig. 2d) for which haploinsufficiency is known to cause a neurodevelopmental disorder with characteristic facial features9. In addition, adjacent deletions (5 kb and 1.7 kb in length) in a proband disrupted exon 2 of AMER1 (Supplementary Fig. 2c), for which deficiency is associated with osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis35. Other classes comprising inversion and deletion are ‘Inv-Loss' (i.e., inversion with flanking deletion; n = 14;8.9%; Fig. 2e) and ‘Loss-Inv-Loss' (i.e., paired deletion inversion; n = 12; 7.6%; Fig. 2f). The representative cases with these types of complex SVs disrupting renal and urinary tract disorder-36 and NN disorder-related genes37, such as KMT2A, AFF2, FMR1, and SRRM2, are shown in Fig. 2e–g. We observed significantly reduced mRNA expression of SRRM2 (P = 4.00E-04), disrupted by ‘Loss-Inv-Loss' in a proband with an NN disorder (Fig. 2g).

Another commonly observed class, termed ‘Loss-invDup' (n = 14; 8.9%), is characterised by copy-number loss plus a nearby duplication linked by inverted rearrangements. For instance, a ‘Loss-invDup' in a proband with NN affected an exon in AUTS2 (Fig. 3a), which has been implicated in neurodevelopment and as a candidate pathogenic gene for numerous neurological disorders38. Another class, ‘Deletion bridge' (i.e., bridge of templated insertion; n = 7; Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 7a, b), led to large deletions (15 Mb in chromosome X in Fig. 3b and 720 kb in chromosome 1 in Supplementary Fig. 7b) containing genes involved in neurodevelopment39,40, such as GALNT2, MECP2, and CTNNB1, in probands with NN disorders (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). ‘Translocation-Loss' (n = 3) led to deletions on either one chromosome (Fig. 3c) or both chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. 7c), resulting in the disruption of phenotype-relevant genes such as ARID1B41 in a proband with an NN disorder.

The schematic segments (d, e) and coverage plot (e) are shown above IGV screenshots displaying long-read (top) and short-read (bottom) in probands.

The other remaining classes, comprising duplication and inversion, are ‘DUP-NML-DUP'3,42 (i.e., paired duplication inversion or Dup-invDup; n = 7; 4.4%; Supplementary Fig. 8) and ‘DUP-TRP/INV-DUP'15 (i.e., Dup-Trp-Dup; n = 14; 8.9%; Supplementary Figs. 7d and 8), exhibit structures involving two duplications linked by inverted rearrangements and duplication–inverted-triplication–duplication, respectively. Interestingly, beyond local-2 jumps (i.e., clusters of two rearrangements) as described above, we also found three instances of ‘DUP-NML-DUP-NML-DUP'43,44,45 (i.e., known as local-3-jumps in the cancer field2) involving three local rearrangements (Supplementary Fig. 9a). Furthermore, other complex duplications, such as dispersed (n = 8; 5.1%) and inverted duplications (n = 2; 1.3%), were also observed. Although most pathogenic effects of these complex SV types involving duplication arise from overexpression of triplosensitive genes15,44 (i.e., gain-of-function), these variant types have been reported to cause disease by loss-of-function mechanisms such as gene disruption46, gene fusion at breakpoints47, and segmental uniparental disomy48.

The complex SVs that did not fit into the described classes were categorised as ‘Unclassified' (n = 56; 35.4%). Two of the complex SVs under the “Unclassified” category had long-read data that enabled us to resolve their genomic configuration (Fig. 3d, e). A proband with a skeletal disorder (Fig. 3d) had a deletion-inversion-deletion-inversion-deletion structure, which affected several exons in EFTUD2, for which deficiency is likely to lead to craniofacial anomalies49. Another case has a structure of duplication followed by ‘Loss-Inv-Loss' which disrupted the phenotype-relevant gene, EDA50 (Fig. 3e). In addition, a case with a small deletion (3 kb in chr22q.13.33) within a large deletion (20 kb in chr22q.13.33), where one of the breakpoints was the same, in a proband with an NN disorder disrupted SHANK3 associated with a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders51 (Supplementary Fig. 9b). Collectively, these results highlight the complex nature of dnSVs in rare disorders.

Overall, our analysis reveals that among probands with dnSVs, 9% (145/1696) exhibit exon-disrupting pathogenic dnSVs associated with the probands' phenotype. Notably, 66 of these 145 (46%) pathogenic SVs were balanced rearrangements (e.g., reciprocal inversion) or CNVs affecting <3 exons that cannot be reliably detected by array-based or whole-exome sequencing methods (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Data 2), highlighting the importance of WGS-based genetic testing in routine clinical care.

A window of 50 kb up- and downstream was added to each intergenic dnSV for this enrichment analysis. The P-value was estimated using a one-sided permutation test.

In our study, we observed that 1.4% of probands with NN disorders harboured complex dnSVs, a prevalence about two times higher than in a previous autism spectrum disorder study26 (0.76%; P = 2.00E-02; two-sided Fisher exact test). Notably, approximately 12% of pathogenic dnSVs in our dataset were identified as complex events (Fig. 4b), highlighting their significant role in rare disorders despite their lower frequency. Moreover, among probands with array-based or whole-exome sequencing data available, 22% of de novo CNVs identified by these data (8/37) were complex SVs, which were previously misclassified as simple dnSVs (Fig. 4c).

Furthermore, our investigation reveals distinctive patterns within intronic and intergenic dnSVs among probands with NN disorders. Intronic dnSVs showed a significant enrichment in known pathogenic genes associated with NN disorders in the G2P database52 (P = 1.00E-03). In contrast, intergenic dnSVs, when assessed for genes within a 50 kb range up- and downstream of the dnSVs (“Methods”), did not show such an association, suggesting the potential pathogenic role of intronic dnSVs in rare disorders (Fig. 4d). Additional studies using RNA-seq and/or CRISPR/Cas-9 genome editing are needed to elucidate the functional impact of these intronic dnSVs on mRNA splicing and expression.

In exploring genomic properties of dnSVs, we observed a prevalent distribution of de novo deletions (dnDELs) and tandem duplications (dnTDs) in gene-dense areas (Supplementary Fig. 10), in line with previous findings in somatic cells2. However, smaller dnDELs (< 10 kb) are enriched in early-replicating regions (P = 1.00E-03; Supplementary Fig. 10a), which is inconsistent with previous reports2.

We observed that the majority of dnSVs, primarily simple dnDELs, exhibit enrichment at the subtelomeric regions across autosomes (Supplementary Fig. 11). We also identified a positive association between the number of subtelomeric dnDELs and early replication regions, especially when they were within 15 Mb of telomere ends (Spearman's rho = 0.56, P = 6.46E-03; Supplementary Fig. 12). In total, the density of dnDELs within 15 Mb of telomere ends (i.e., 1.3/Mb) is 2.8 times greater than the autosome-wide average (i.e., 0.457/Mb).

We observed a distinctive sex difference in patterns of dnSVs, specifically, maternal dnSVs were enriched for larger deletions, while paternal dnSVs were enriched for smaller deletions (P = 4.99E-05; Fig. 5a). We further confirmed a similar enrichment pattern using an independent dataset26 (P = 1.63E-03; Fig. 5a). This gender-specific difference is potentially in line with a higher incidence of aneuploidy in oocytes than in sperm53. The higher rate of aneuploidy is known to be associated with the distinct features of oocytes54, such as the architecture of the meiotic spindle, the level of cortical tension at the oocyte surface, weaknesses in surveillance mechanisms that monitor chromosome segregation, and environmental factors. Additionally, we found that maternal dnDELs are enriched at the subtelomeric regions (< 15 Mb) of chromosome 16 (Fig. 5b). We observed similar maternal enrichment of dnDELs in subtelomeric regions of chromosome 16 in an independent cohort26 (Fig. 5b), suggesting possible sex-specific mechanisms in the generation of dnSVs.

The P-values were calculated using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. b Proportion of dnDELs within 15 Mb of telomere ends according to parent of origin in the GEL (left) and in the CEPH & SFARI cohort (right).

Our investigation provides a substantial advancement in the understanding of de novo structural variants in rare disorders, encompassing an extensive cohort of 13,702 parent–child trios. In particular, we provide insights into the role of complex SVs in the aetiology of rare disorders.

The prevalence of dnSVs, affecting 12% of probands, highlights the importance of integrating these variants into the broader spectrum of genetic factors contributing to rare disorders. Unlike conventional cytogenetic methods, such as array Comparative Genomic Hybridisation (CGH)-based technologies, WGS offers unparalleled precision in characterising the genomic configuration of complex dnSVs. This is particularly crucial as some simple deletions and insertions may be integral components of complex SVs often overlooked by array-based / whole-exome sequencing methods. For instance, in 37 cases where array and or whole-exome sequencing data were available, we found that 8 complex dnSVs (22%) were misclassified as simple dnSVs. In addition, 51 of 151 (34%) pathogenic SVs identified in our study were balanced rearrangements (e.g., balanced inversion) or CNVs affecting \(\le 2\) exons that can't be detected by array-based / whole-exome sequencing methods, highlighting the importance of WGS-based genetic testing in routine clinical care.

Notably, dnSVs exhibited non-random distribution patterns, showing enrichment in specific genomic locations associated with distinct features depending on the parent of origin. Strikingly, we observed an enrichment of maternal dnDELs within 15 Mb of the telomeres of chromosome 16. This enrichment positively correlates with skewed early replication regions across chromosomes. While the genomic basis for this maternal bias in subtelomeric regions of chromosome 16 is unknown, previous reports have suggested potential explanations55. These include early subtelomeric replication in meiosis56, increased rates of meiotic double-strand breaks in the distal parts of chromosomes57, or biased maternal non-crossover gene conversion58. Overall, these findings indicate the need for further investigation into parental influence and region-specific impacts on disease manifestation.

We note several limitations in our approach, which open potential avenues for future investigations. Complex structural variants are still underestimated in our cohort because of the inherent limitations of short-read-based SV discovery. For example, SVs in repeat-rich regions (e.g., segmental duplications or retrotransposons) remain challenging to identify. Although we identified some of these SVs using read-depth-based algorithms (e.g., CANVAS), resolving the genomic configuration of complex SVs using read-depth-specific calls that do not provide read orientation, along with read-pattern-based calls, is challenging. Furthermore, short-read sequencing is known to fail to capture large SVs, especially large insertions. Due to the lower detection sensitivity of de novo retrotransposition, with the current pipeline, these variants have been excluded from our analysis. Specifically, we observed a rate of 0.01 events per genome, which is far lower than expected (0.03-0.038 per genome26,59). Future research could explore techniques such as long-read sequencing60 to enhance our ability to detect dnSVs in repetitive regions61. Finally, the systematic identification of gene duplication leading to triplosensitivity62 and inherited pathogenic SVs will be needed to facilitate more comprehensive diagnostics.

Overall, our findings expand the understanding of dnSVs in rare disorders and highlight the need for ongoing research to unravel the complexities of their contribution to the aetiology of rare disorders and the potential for clinical application.

We used available data from the rare disease cohort of the 100,000 Genomes Project generated by Genomics England21. The 100,000 Genomes Project was approved by the East of England—Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee (REF 20/EE/0035). Genomic blood DNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq PCR-free protocol, and whole-genome sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq X platform (2 × 150-bp paired-end reads). Read alignment and SV calling using Isaac63 and Manta22, respectively, were performed by the Genomics England Bioinformatics team21. The details of sequencing and variant calling have been previously described21. Manta VCF files were converted to BEDPE format using SVtools (v0.5.1)64 and then BEDTools (v2.31.0)65 was utilised to extract proband-specific SVs with ≥ 50 bp in length for each family (Supplementary Fig. 13). We first removed SVs on Y chromosome and further removed SVs with evidence of clipped reads (i.e., split reads) at breakpoints in either parent. Specifically, SVs supported by ≥ 4 clipped reads at either breakpoint or ≥ 2 clipped reads at both breakpoints in either parent were excluded. SVs found in 3 or more samples were removed because such SVs were likely alignment artefacts. We selected SVs flagged as “PASS” or “MGE10kb” (i.e., Manta calls with length < 10 kb) and further narrowed down SVs with the Manta score > 30 and supporting discordant reads > 10. We rescued SVs with imprecise breakpoints if they were supported by CANVAS66. In detail, SVs tagged as “IMPRECISE” (i.e., imprecise breakpoints) were rescued if they were also flagged as “ColocalizedCanvas”. We excluded SVs with VAF < 0.1 (n = 10) to remove mosaic SVs. Translocation through retrotransposon-mediated 3′ transduction was excluded to focus on dnSVs. All SVs were manually validated to identify high-confidence de novo SVs using the IGV browser67. Specifically, we visually validated the presence of abnormal reads (i.e., discordant/split reads) in probands and the absence of such reads in their parents. We additionally called CNVs (i.e., deletion and duplication) with > 10 kb using CANVAS to identify more diagnostic CNVs. Read-depth-specific calls were only used to assess their pathogenicity because clustering and classification (i.e., resolving genomic configuration of complex SVs) of read-depth calls that did not have read-orientation were challenging. Long-read sequencing data (23 resequenced samples with PacBio technology), RNA-seq (whole blood RNA sequencing from 5,546 samples) and diagnostic SNV/Indels were obtained from Genomic England21. Previous dnCNV calls from array-based or whole-exome sequencing were obtained from the DDD study cohort23. Insertion events called by Manta22 were further classified into retrotranspositions using RepeatMasker. This process resulted in a lower sensitivity because Manta with Issac-based alignment is not optimised to call retrotranspositions. Retrotransposition-specific identification tools, such as MELT68 or xTea69, are needed to increase sensitivity for retrotransposition detection. To estimate the proportion of probands with complex SVs in the previous study26, we obtained 19 probands with complex SVs where “sv_type” was “CPX” and “role” was “proband”.

We used ClusterSV2 (https://github.com/cancerit/ClusterSV) to group rearrangements (i.e., breakpoints), into rearrangement clusters. The key advantage of ClusterSV is to identify clusters of dispersed breakpoints45 without requiring a predefined distance threshold, allowing for a data-driven detection of complex genomic rearrangements. We defined complex SVs as those with ≥ 2 clustered breakpoints except for simple SVs involving reciprocal inversion, balanced translocation, templated insertion, and dispersed duplication. In general, we classified the types of complex SVs according to the previous study that comprehensively characterised somatic complex SVs using thousands of cancer genomes2. In short, complex SVs involving two inversions were categorised into Loss-invDup, DUP-TRP/INV-DUP, Inv-LossDU (i.e., inversion with flanking deletion), Loss-invLoss (i.e., paired deletion inversion), and DUP-NML-DUP (i.e., paired duplication inversion) according to read patterns and copy numbers (Supplementary Fig. 8). Complex SVs involving two deletions were classified as Loss-Loss. Bridge deletion (i.e., bridge of templated insertion) and Translocation-Loss (i.e., translocation with deletion) were classified using the previously described criteria2,70. DUP-NML-DUP-NML-DUP (i.e., Local-3 jumps) involving three local rearrangements were discovered according to the read patterns described in the previous cancer study2. Breakpoints filtered out near unresolved SV classes were rescued if they could resolve the configuration of unresolved SV classes according to the types of SV defined. For the remaining unresolved SV, CANVAS calls were used to resolve their genomic configuration manually. Complex SVs that did not fit into the described classes were categorised as ‘Unclassified'. All complex SVs were manually validated using IGV browser (2.18.2)67, Samplot (v1.3.0)71, or BamSnap (v0.2.19)72.

We used unfazed (v1.0.2)73, which employs both extended read-backed- and SNV allele-balance- phasing, to identify the parent of origin for dnSVs. Haplotypecaller (v3.3)74 was utilised to make an input for unfazed. Phasable dnSVs (51%; 962/1870) were used for downstream analysis concerning the parent of origin. To classify the timing of maternally derived duplication into meiosis I and II, we first identified duplication (including those in complex SVs) from maternal origin (step 1) and further classified them into meiosis I and II (step 2) using a set of informative genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 6) For binary classification at each step, the ratio of the number of SNPs supporting one class to another class was calculated, and a class for which the ratio was greater than 0.9 was chosen, At least three SNPs were required for either class at each step. These filtering criteria could time large duplications with a handful of erroneously called SNPs and remove ambiguous duplications such as those originating from both parents during early development (e.g., potentially due to mitotic crossing-over). The timing of paternally derived duplications was not inferred because duplications can also occur in a premeiotic state during male gametogenesis throughout life.

The identified SVs disrupting exons were reviewed for potential clinical relevance by NHS clinical scientists and/or Genomics England. We considered SVs as being potential (likely) pathogenic SVs if at least one of the following criteria were fulfilled: (i) the variant had been clinically assessed as likely pathogenic or pathogenic by an NHS genomic laboratory hub. In detail, the variant had been assessed by an NHS clinical laboratory according to the best practice guidelines recommended by the Association for Clinical Genomic Science (ACGS) as being likely pathogenic or pathogenic and related to the primary phenotype for which the participant was recruited to the 100,000 Genomes Project. (ii) the variant had been reviewed on a research basis and considered to be a strong candidate diagnostic variant. In the research review, variants resulting in loss of function for genes in which haploinsufficiency is a known mechanism of disease or variants resulting in loss of a critical domain impacting genes associated with a phenotype relevant to the primary clinical indication were considered as candidate diagnostic variants.

We classified pathogenic SVs annotated with “reciprocal inversion” or “reciprocal translocation” as not likely to be detected by array-based or whole-exome sequencing methods. In addition, the SVs involving deletions spanning < 3 exons of GENCODE canonical transcript75 were classified into this category.

We first extracted the non-coding dnSVs (i.e., intronic and intergenic dnSVs) for which genomic coordinates did not include any exons in NN disorders based on the Gencode basic V45 GTF file and then obtained the known pathogenic genes associated with NN disorders from the Gene2Phenotype developmental disorders panel52. Specifically, we kept all genes with organ specificity equal to “Brain/Cognition”, allelic requirement equal to “monoallelic_autosomal”, and a confidence category equal to “strong” or “definitive” (n = 190 genes). We then computed the observed-over-expected ratio for the overlap between the non-coding dnSVs and known pathogenic genes in NN disorders using the Genome Association Tester software76. Intronic and intergenic regions were obtained based on the canonical transcript of protein-coding genes in the Gencode basic V45 GTF file using BioMart and GencoDymo R packages, and bedtools65. These two regions were used as a workspace in GAT to test the over-representation of dnSVs in intronic and/or intergenic regions of known pathogenic genes. We added a window of 5–500 kb (5, 10, 25, 50, and 500 kb) up- and downstream to each intergenic dnSVs to perform the enrichment test. The number of random samples (“--num-samples”) for each GAT run was set to 1000.

We equally partitioned the genome into 5 Mb bins based on their distance to the telomere ends. For comparison, we also partitioned the genome based on their distance to the centromeres. For the validation cohort, we downloaded the all_dnsv.csv file from Belyeu et al. 26. In total, there are n = 309 CEPH and SFAI dnSVs across autosomes after removing chrX and chrY. Finally, only n = 192 dnDELs were used in the validation analysis.

Crick: A Mind in Motion — from DNA to the Brain Matthew Cobb Profile Books (2025)

Francis Crick has gone down in history as half of a double act with James Watson — a duo perhaps almost as iconic as the double-helix structure of DNA that they proposed. The pair were immortalized in Watson's sensational 1968 book, The Double Helix, with Crick painted as garrulous and cerebral and Watson as gauche but driven. Watson had initially described his first draft as a novel, yet other published accounts of the discovery and the personalities involved have stuck closely to the script ever since.

In a magisterial new biography, Crick, zoologist and historian Matthew Cobb revisits the double-helix breakthrough, a discovery he discussed in forensic detail in his book Life's Greatest Secret (2015). Yet, this time, the publication of the structure and the immediate aftermath of the discovery occupy just 41 pages. Instead, Cobb explores how Crick's thinking, writing and interactions with others transcended that brilliant, yet contested, episode, revolutionizing molecular biology and influencing evolutionary and developmental biology, visual neuroscience and ideas about consciousness.

At the same time, he makes a more sustained attempt than either of Crick's previous biographers (Matt Ridley and Robert Olby) to answer several questions. Who was Crick? What kind of person was he? What did he care about?

Crick was notoriously reluctant to divulge personal information or even have his photograph taken. Combing through a remarkably comprehensive set of personal and professional archives with meticulous attention to detail, Cobb has reconstructed Crick's relationships with those who were essential crew mates on his intellectual odyssey.

Crick was born in 1916 in Northampton, a market town in the English Midlands, and grew up in a comfortable but not notably intellectual home. From an early age he had a burning desire to know why things were the way they were, a curiosity he satisfied by burying himself in the family copies of Arthur Mee's eight-volume The Children's Encyclopedia (1910). He did well enough at school to go to University College London to study physics, where he later began a PhD on the viscosity of water — “the dullest problem imaginable”, as Crick later said.

As Cobb explains, Crick's future was transformed by his experiences during the Second World War. His PhD studies were interrupted when he was called up to serve in the British Admiralty, conducting research into naval mines — real-time problem-solving that suited his restless nature. In the Mine Design Department cafeteria he met Georg Kreisel, an Austrian refugee philosopher who had just graduated from the University of Cambridge, UK. Kreisel's conversation and voluminous correspondence challenged Crick to sharpen his thinking and delighted him with their obscenities. Cobb makes the salacious letters part of the lifelong soundtrack to Crick's intellectual endeavours.

Also working at the Admiralty was the “vivacious, talented and tolerant” artist Odile Speed. She became Crick's second wife in 1949; their partnership was one of mutual devotion that allowed for his numerous affairs. Odile helped to develop his interest in art and literature, ran their households, hosted exuberant parties and raised their children. In short, she provided an environment in which Crick had the luxury of devoting all of his energy to his intellectual life.

In the late 1940s, disillusioned with physics and inspired by physicist Erwin Schrödinger's 1944 book What is Life?, Crick decided that the nature of life was the only question worth pursuing, other than the neural basis of consciousness. He began a new PhD project in structural biology at the Medical Research Council's Unit for Research on the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems — later known as the Laboratory of Molecular Biology — in Cambridge, UK, where he worked for almost 30 years. Under the genial chairmanship of molecular biologist Max Perutz, Crick never had to teach or grapple with university administration: he applied for a grant only once in his life. He had the grace to admit that luck had played a part in his success, but to some extent he made his own luck.

Cobb presents the double-helix story as much more of a collaboration with chemist Rosalind Franklin and biophysicist Maurice Wilkins at King's College London than Crick and Watson acknowledged in their iconic 1953 paper (J. D. Watson and F. H. C. Crick Nature 171, 737–738; 1953). He exonerates Crick and Watson of theft, but not of bad manners. “They should have requested permission to use the data,” Cobb writes. “They did not.”

The double-helix structure provided a springboard to understanding how information is transferred between DNA and the proteins it encodes. In Crick's PhD thesis, he had called this the ‘central problem' of biology. He tackled the issue with geneticist Sydney Brenner. Between them, they conceived the existence of messenger RNA, showed that the sequence of bases in mRNA acts as a code that dictates each protein's amino-acid sequence and found that three bases encoded each amino acid (F. H. C. Crick et al. Nature 192, 1227–1232; 1961).

At the US Environmental Protection Agency, scientists say proposed cuts will gut research. Credit: Eric Lee/Bloomberg via Getty

For 30 years, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has conducted controlled air-pollution studies at a state-of-the-art facility at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The facility is equipped to test numerous airborne pollutants, including ozone, diesel, wildfire smoke and chlorine. Data collected in its chambers have been pivotal to establishing stricter air-quality standards for deadly pollutants, and have been instrumental in protecting the health of people in the United States.

However, in February, shortly after US President Donald Trump took office, the EPA — which is charged with protecting the nation's environment and its people's health — notified the university that it would not be renewing its lease. By May, research had ceased. “There are no other places with the capability of doing these studies on the wide range of pollutants that the Chapel Hill facility does,” says Robert Devlin, a former EPA researcher who worked at the facility until recently. In August, after almost 40 years at the agency, Devlin retired when his appointment was not renewed.

The exposure laboratory was under the purview of the EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD), which pursued a broad swathe of independent research into air and water quality, toxicology, homeland security and waste management. It has been hit particularly hard by cuts the Trump administration has made to federal agency science. Internal documents suggest that lay-offs and voluntary early-retirement programmes have already reduced ORD's 1,600-person staff by one-third.

The remnants of ORD are expected to be folded into a new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions (OASES) that reports directly to the EPA administrator, a presidential appointee. The reorganization has spooked agency scientists, who fear that research priorities might end up being set according to a political agenda. “One value that the EPA's ORD provided was independent scientific review of proposed regulatory actions,” says former EPA toxicologist George Woodall, who retired in September after receiving a termination notice.

In addition to cuts at the EPA, the administration has already cut or proposed cutting more than US$50 billion in research funding across the nation's science agencies, with research on climate, ecosystems, renewable energy and health disparities particularly affected. Although the administration characterizes the cuts and reorganizations of federal research programmes as realigning them with the president's priorities, critics say the aim is to remove environmental and health protections and other regulatory safeguards. The cuts to EPA staffing are “the biggest blow that agency has ever had”, says Christopher Sellers at Stony Brook University in New York, who interviews EPA scientists for the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, a watchdog group for US federal environmental data.

“It's not just EPA. Science is being destroyed across many agencies,” says a senior ORD official who was put on administrative leave in June. It remains to be seen whether Congress will pass Trump's proposed budget request for 2026.

Meanwhile, a US government shutdown has been in place since 1 October, after lawmakers failed to agree on a funding bill for the current fiscal year. As Nature went to press, the shutdown had stretched into its fifth week, with no end in sight. Some 4,000 federal agency workers have been laid off since it began, with plans to reach around 10,000, according to the Office of Management and Budget.

At the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1,300 employees, including many investigating disease outbreaks and collecting data on infectious diseases, were fired on 10 October; roughly half of those were subsequently rehired. Agency watchdogs are concerned that cuts to CDC staff have paved the way for efforts to spread misinformation. On 22 September, the secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, and Trump made a series of controversial claims about autism, most notably that use of the painkiller acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) during pregnancy is a suspected cause — a claim that global public-health bodies say is not backed up by scientific evidence.

As agencies lose scientific expertise and evidence-based guidance, the knock-on effects will be widespread and costly — to the economy, the environment, public health and the broader research enterprise. Agency scientists say the cuts will compromise a swathe of resources and initiatives, including hurricane forecasting, air-quality improvements, public protections against chemical exposure and efforts to monitor endangered species — science that falls under the government's purview to protect citizens and the environment.

Non-government entities and academic scientists typically cannot conduct coordinated research at the scale needed to inform US policy. Scientific agencies' institutional knowledge will take years, if not decades, to replace, current and former federal scientists say. And early-career researchers fear that the cuts to federal agency science and funding will hurt their long-term career prospects.

Nature spoke to 19 current and former federal agency scientists, covering the EPA, the CDC, NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the US Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to find out what agency-directed research has been lost and what that will mean for the United States. Many of those currently employed by these agencies requested anonymity for fear of retribution. Nature contacted all six agencies for comment, but the CDC, NOAA, NIH and USGS did not respond.

Beyond air and water pollution, the EPA oversees tests to determine whether new chemicals — more than 2,000 of which enter commercial use each year — are hazardous to human health. EPA scientists expect that the Integrated Risk Information System, an EPA database of chemical data and risks, will be dismantled — a move industry groups have long been pushing for. This would “put the agency in a reactive rather than proactive mode” when it comes to chemical safety, says Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, a former ORD principal deputy assistant administrator for science.

On top of that, research on pressing environmental concerns has come to a standstill. At the EPA, a series of strategic planning meetings intended to map out future research priorities have not taken place. “We were really humming along,” says the senior ORD official, noting that the office was making progress on prioritizing research on PFAS, also known as forever chemicals, and microplastics. Determining how these pollutants get into the environment “would require the kind of research only EPA can do”, they add.

When Nature asked the EPA for a response to the numerous criticisms about cuts to research programmes, a spokesperson pointed to the creation of OASES, “which will allow EPA to prioritize research and gold-standard science more than ever before and put it at the forefront of rule-makings and technical assistance to states”.

Scientists at NASA also worry that crucial efforts to track the health of the planet (and its inhabitants) will not continue — among them, efforts to monitor greenhouse-gas emissions. “One of the first things I worry about is environmental monitoring,” says Jack Kaye, a former associate director for research at the Earth Science Division of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, which is based in Washington DC. Field campaigns to track air pollutants, for example, require dozens of sophisticated instruments to monitor chemicals and meteorological conditions synchronously on land, in the air and from space, often for weeks at a time and with the involvement of multiple, sometimes international, partners, says Kaye.

Trump's 2026 budget proposal — a spending blueprint currently in legislative limbo owing to the government shutdown — cuts dozens of active and planned NASA missions. One casualty is the pair of Orbiting Carbon Observatory satellites, which are key to tracking global carbon dioxide emissions, spotting early signs of drought and monitoring plant health. When asked about how this might compromise NASA's ability to monitor the environment, a NASA spokesperson pointed to the president's budget request, which says the satellites are not aligned with Trump's priorities and are “climate missions beyond their prime mission”.

NOAA has a similar global remit, investigating the complex relationship between the oceans and atmosphere. Investigating climate change has become a key research area, says Craig McLean, a former NOAA assistant administrator for research, who is based in Silver Spring, Maryland. In an effort to understand how the oceans shape the climate, he says, “We built satellites, ships, drifters, floats, gliders, models and other expertise.” But the Trump administration's budget proposes axing the entire budget for NOAA's office of oceanic and atmospheric research, a move Kaye calls “devastating” for the nation's climate research.

The administration also proposed closing NOAA's 10 research labs and 16 cooperative institutes, which focus on different research areas. One, the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), based in Miami, Florida, models hurricanes using observations from ‘hurricane hunter' flights, drones and gliders, says Robert Atlas, a former director of AOML. “Flying through a hurricane? I don't see anyone else doing that,” adds McLean.

On the basis of previous calculations, the loss of those observations would translate to a 20–40% decrease in hurricane forecast accuracy, which would result in not only increased economic losses — of $5 billion for each major hurricane striking the country — but also increased loss of life, says Atlas. These cuts seem to have been a bridge too far; the House of Representatives and the Senate have pressed forward with legislation to protect NOAA's research labs and cooperative institutes.

But not every agency has received congressional protection. At the USGS, the Ecosystems Mission Area, which monitors the health of species, communities and ecosystems, has been targeted for closure. The president's 2026 budget request eliminated almost $300 million in funding for this area, which is responsible for studying invasive species, ecosystem restoration, wildlife disease and biodiversity, among other things.

The USGS “does science to help preserve natural resources and public lands for the nation”, says an anonymous USGS researcher. “We're not doing science for science's sake; it's about ensuring these resources are there for the next generation.” For example, the USGS conducts two major bird monitoring efforts, which both collect population data on hundreds of species, to inform conservation efforts and hunting regulations. “Academia isn't going to run a bird survey,” says Sam Droege, a wildlife biologist who works at the USGS Bee Lab in Laurel, Maryland. “You don't get tenure doing that.”

Scientists across several agencies are raising the alarm about the administration's push to shut down a wealth of climate-based research. One of the worst transgressions, say researchers, is Trump's attempt to overturn a 2009 EPA finding that CO2 and other greenhouse gases harm human health. This legal finding, called the endangerment finding, authorizes the EPA to regulate these gases as part of the 1963 Clean Air Act, which empowers the agency to establish and enforce air-quality standards.

“Now they are starting to proffer misinformation and putting a government seal on it,” says McLean. Agency scientists say that this, along with the decision to halt nearly all national climate-change research, will result in the country being unable to adapt to climate extremes, which will bring huge losses in food production and, ultimately, greater loss of human lives during natural disasters.

In response to these criticisms, an EPA spokesperson wrote that the EPA's proposal to rescind the endangerment finding is legal in nature and that “the agency considered a variety of sources and information in assessing whether the predictions made, and assumptions used, in the 2009 Endangerment Finding are accurate and consistent with the limits on EPA's authority under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act”.

The study of coupled networks with parametric amplification of vacuum fluctuations has garnered increasing interest due to its intricate physics and potential applications. In these systems, parametric interactions lead to beam-splitter coupling and two-mode squeezing, creating quadrature-dependent dynamics. These systems can be modelled as bosonic networks, arrays or lattices, exhibiting exotic effects such as unidirectional amplification and non-Hermitian chiral transport that influence multimode squeezing. However, exploring and controlling these network dynamics experimentally in all-optical systems remains challenging. Recent advances in integrated nonlinear microresonators, known as Kerr microcombs, have enabled the generation and control of broadband high-repetition pulses on microchips. Kerr microcombs exhibit intriguing nonlinear dynamics where coherent photons occupy discrete spectral lines, leading to multimode squeezed vacuum states. Here we explore the lattice dynamics of vacuum fluctuations driven by dissipative Kerr microcombs. We design a photonic chip on which a spontaneously emergent pair of pulses creates extended multimode states of parametrically amplified vacuum fluctuations. These states exhibit oscillatory dynamics, with implications for squeezing and secondary comb formation. By employing integrated micro-heaters, we tune the vacuum fluctuations to eliminate the oscillations, establishing a fundamental connection between non-Hermitian lattice symmetries and Kerr combs, and paving the way for exotic quadrature-dependent optical networks with broad implications for quantum and classical photonic technologies.

a. Optical image of the Kerr ring resonator alongside the smaller on-chip filter ring and micro-heaters. b. Normalized transmission over wavelength detuning of a ultra high-Q resonance in our device with intrinsic quality factor of 9 million c. Integrated dispersion of the TE mode of the Kerr ring resonator (blue) and fit to D2 = 1.2MHz, D1 = 152.7 GHz (red). Dispersion defects are avoided mode crossings with other mode families. d. Cold cavity intrinsic quality factors (Qi - red) and coupling quality factors (Qc - blue) of the resonances in the relevant mode-family.

a. Transmission as a function of pump detuning. The different colored lowercase Roman numerals and color shades correspond to the different stages of the microcomb. b. The spectrum of the different combs specified by lowercase Roman numerals in (a). i and ii correspond to the primary 2-FSR comb which is the main focus of this work, while iii is a 1-FSR comb, and iv-v are chaotic states. Finally vi is a 2-FSR stable soliton crystal state. c Single-photon optical spectrum analyzer (SPOSA) measurement of photon populations in above threshold (red) and below threshold (green) modes of the 2-FSR state.

a. Transmission as a function of continuous pump detuning (toward longer wavelengths). This plot is the same as in fig 1(b) but the shaded areas mark different regimes plotted in (b). b. Intracavity field in real space for the transition between the (i): primary comb (2-FSR) and the secondary comb (1-FSR) corresponding to the shaded red region in (a). (ii): the transition from the secondary comb (1-FSR) to a second oscillating 1-FSR comb which oscillates (shaded green region). Experimental evidance of this transition can be found in section 3 of Supplementary Material.

a. Spectrum of the 2-FSR primary Kerr comb (red) and light in odd-numbered modes (green). b. Intracavity field in real space (rolling Turing) c. g(2) correlations of the below threshold light. d. Eigen-spectrum of the comb showing that a non-oscillating supermode crosses threshold, and that the spectrum also has oscillating supermodes with less parametric gain. e. The squeezing RF spectrum, showing the single peak which correspond with the non-oscillating supermode that crosses threshold in d. f. The spectrum of the most squeezed state in the basis of cavity modes.

a. Schematic diagram of the experimental setup. The abbreviations are: EDFA- erbium doped amplifier, EOM- electro-optic modulator, WS- waveshaper, PD- photodiode, pre-amp- low-power EDFA.

a. Illustration of the above threshold comb (red) and below threshold comb (green) in the model, and of the different terms - pair generation and Bragg scattering that couple the different modes. b. The 1D lattice unit cell, in the generalized quadrature basis c. Different band topologies (different number of exceptional points) of the Brilloin zone of the lattice in b, top plot corresponds to \({A}_{\pm 2}/{A}_{0}=0.25,\Delta \tilde{\omega }=2\), center plot corresponds to \({A}_{2}/{A}_{0}=0.25,{A}_{-2}/{A}_{0}=0.2,\Delta \tilde{\omega }=2\) and bottom plot to \({A}_{\pm 2}/{A}_{0}=0.25,\Delta \tilde{\omega }=0\). d. The number of exceptional points for different 2-FSR Kerr combs on different slices of the 3D parameter space (i-iii). The parameter space is spanned by the two ratios of the sidebands and the overall detuning (bottom right).

a.-c. The real (blue dots) and imaginary (red dots) parts of the eigenvalues of the amplified vacuum supermodes driven by a 2-FSR comb with different values of \({D}_{1}^{{\prime} }\): 0, 3 and 8 MHz respectively. For larger \({D}_{1}^{{\prime} }\) the purely real eigenvalues gradually become complex. Highlighted quadrature supermodes are those close to threshold. d.-g. The frequency(ω)-dependent squeezing spectrum of the supermodes close to threshold (highlighted). Each line represents the supermode spectrum for a linearly swept intra cavity power, and the supermodes can be seen to narrow as they approach threshold. The supermode in f. does not narrow asymptotically because e. reaches threshold first. h.,i. The supermode composition as a function of cavity modes of the multimode squeezed states, for the supermodes in e. and f. respectively (colours correspond to the frequencies).

a. Top: eigenvalue solution of the quadrature Hamiltonian \({\mathcal{M}}\) for a 2-FSR Kerr comb with side band drop ratio of \({\mathcal{R}}=2.25\), and D2/2π = 1.2MHz. Bottom: Zoom-in on the quadrature supermodes with higher-gain showing that all of them are undetuned (imaginary value is 0.) b. Same as a. only with \({D}_{1}^{{\prime} }/2\pi =2.8\,MHz\). c.,d. Numerically counting the un-detuned states as a function of underlying GVD (D2) and detuning of the comb for the symmetric case of \({D}_{1}^{{\prime} }=0\) and the non-symmetric case \({D}_{1}^{{\prime} }/2\pi =2.8\,MHz\).

The gut microbiome presents in a multi-kingdom form and tunes host health in various ways. Studies published in 2025 have further pushed this frontier by unveiling the enigmatic roles of the gut fungi and bacteria in cross-organ regulations of host homeostasis through metabolite and immune cell-mediated pathways.

The symbiotic gut fungus Fusarium foetens ameliorates metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis via a secondary metabolite–CerS6–ceramide axis3.

Gut microbiome-specific T cells induce neuroinflammation across organs through molecular mimicry and antigenic cross-reactivity5.

Heterogeneous biotransformations of plant-based dietary phenolic glycosides by diverse gut Bacteroides bacteria result in a functional diversification of dietary components on the mammalian host health8.

In 2011, after months of complaints from residents about the department's SWAT team—broken TVs, missing cash, lost electronics, even a stolen pornographic video—the Kansas City, Kansas, Police Department launched an undercover sting with help from the FBI to root out the department's lying and stealing cops. They called it Operation Sticky Fingers.

On January 6, Selective Crime Occurrence Reduction Enforcement Unit officers served a search warrant at a rented house, carefully staged with thousands of dollars' worth of electronics, weed, and cash, unaware that the house was wired with hidden cameras embedded into an alarm clock and smoke detector, recording their every move. The ruse worked. Cameras captured three officers stealing video games, an Apple iPod, headphones, and $640 in cash. All three were fired and charged federally with conspiracy, deprivation of civil rights, and theft of government property.

This story is part of a joint investigation between KCUR and WIRED.

In interviews with investigators, however, the three implicated cops singled out a fourth SCORE officer, not captured by the hidden cameras: Jeff Gardner, a man who KCKPD investigators found had recently punched his girlfriend in the jaw so hard that she needed medical attention.

According to his fellow officers, Gardner had a history of smashing TVs during raids, stealing video games, and even one time swiping a bag of crab legs. “You can't catch me unless you catch me on video,” an officer told prosecutors that he recalled Gardner once saying.

With only the word of these three discredited officers, prosecutors declined to press charges. But in a memo to then-chief Rick Armstrong, the district attorney warned that any future police work involving Gardner—whether detective work, arrests, or testimony—should be viewed with deep suspicion. “It would be highly unlikely we would file a case that is based in significant part on his testimony,” the memo concluded.

The memo placed Gardner on the department's highly secret Veracity Disclosure List, commonly known as a Giglio List, which refers to Giglio v. United States, a 1972 decision which established that the prosecution must disclose any information that might question the credibility of its witnesses. In KCKPD's case, this is a roster of officers whose credibility may be so compromised that the department believes their involvement in criminal cases, whether through testimony, arrests, or investigative work, could jeopardize prosecutions.

Nevertheless, 15 years later, Gardner still works at KCKPD. He is among 62 current and former officers who engaged in misconduct so damaging to their credibility that, if called to testify, it may need to be reported to the courts.

Gardner did not respond to a request for comment.

Documents exposed in a major hack of the Kansas City, Kansas, Police Department, reviewed by WIRED and KCUR, reveal the department's Giglio List for the first time, along with dramatic details of the misconduct that put officers on it, from incompetence to domestic violence. Published by the transparency nonprofit Distributed Denial of Secrets, more than 1 terabyte of hacked documents paint a disturbing picture: Officers with egregious credibility issues—those the department itself investigated and found untrustworthy—were not only allowed to stay on the force but often rose through the ranks or moved on to other departments, without the public knowing.

KCUR and WIRED corroborated the Giglio List found in the hack with testimony from the then-Wyandotte County district attorney in a 2011 case. The full context of what landed a particular officer on the list was not always evident.

The files are a further indication of what has been an open secret for decades—residents' accusations that many KCKPD officers were corrupt or racist—and were made very public with the 2022 arrest of Roger Golubski, a retired KCKPD detective accused in two federal cases for allegedly sexually assaulting at least seven women while on duty and protecting a drug dealer's sex trafficking ring. Golubski told his roommate at the time that he'd rather “eat my gun” than go to jail. He died of an apparent suicide on December 2, 2024, on the first day of his federal court trial.

Golubski's file also highlights a broader flaw in the Giglio List and the department's internal misconduct investigations: whether these records accurately reflect an officer's complete history of misconduct. In Golubski's case, the file cites only a single incident from the 1970s and makes no mention of the numerous allegations he would later face. That omission lends credibility to the criticism from KCKPD watchdogs who argue that department leadership knew about Golubski's actions for decades—and covered it up.

When shown the list of officers included in the hack, retired KCKPD detective Max Seifert was surprised to see some officers' names on the list whom he considered good cops, while leaving off officers who had flagrant misconduct but were intentionally protected by higher-ups.

“There are names that should be on that list, that I felt were worthy of criminal prosecution or deserved to be criminally prosecuted,” said Seifert, who worked with Golubski for 31 years before, he says, he was forced into retirement. He later sued the Unified Government, which runs Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas, alleging retaliation for speaking out about the police beating of a motorist.

“To me that's an injustice to the officers that are good, and it speaks to some of the things going on in the department that some of the names were left off,” Seifert said.

The alleged misconduct cited in the hacked files also varies widely, ranging from relatively minor violations like time theft to major sins like having a sexual relationship with a confidential informant.

Ultimately, the department's Giglio List is critically important because it directly affects criminal cases. An officer's credibility is on the line at trial, and any past offenses, if turned over to the defense by a prosecutor, can impeach the officer and harm a prosecution. If the misconduct on a Giglio List is a major offense, like excessive force, racial profiling, or evidence tampering, prosecutors simply refuse to let officers testify, said Stephen McAllister, a former US Attorney in Kansas who is now a University of Kansas law professor.

“Officers don't like it, and understandably, because when you get on the Giglio List, if it gets bad enough, then no prosecutor is going to want to use you as a witness, and the police department may decide they really don't have a use for you,” McAllister said.

Nancy Chartrand, KCKPD's Public Information Officer, confirmed that the department was the target of a “cyber-incident” in 2024, which was reported to federal investigating agencies. She was concerned that publishing the names of officers from “this unverified, stolen list” was irresponsible and “could unfairly and significantly harm these officers' reputations.”

“An officer being listed does not mean they are barred from testifying or that their testimony is impeachable. It simply indicates the potential existence of disclosable material,” Chartrand said. To comply with its legal obligations under Giglio, the department errs on the side of disclosing potentially impeachable misconduct to prosecutors, but ultimately it's for the courts to decide whether specific officer misconduct is disclosable to the defense, she said.

Last year, the ransomware gang BlackSuit published the police files after the Kansas City, Kansas, Police Department reportedly refused to pay a ransom. The breach was part of a growing trend of law enforcement and other government agencies being targeted by ransomware groups. In 2021, for instance, another ransomware group called Babuk hacked the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Department, stealing 250 gigabytes of sensitive data. A joint investigation by the Center for Investigative Reporting and WAMU/DCist later reported that the records showed that MPD had tried to fire at least 24 officers for criminal misconduct—but high-ranking officials, including the then-police chief, intervened to keep them on the force.

The KCKPD breach is even more extensive than the DC police leak, which were also published by DDOSecrets. The hacked files contained over a terabyte of records spanning decades, including operational plans for law enforcement raids, human resources data on overtime payments, internal affairs databases, and more.

According to Johann Drolshagen, CEO of Equal Playing Field Solutions and founder of a nationwide, publicly accessible database that tracks misconduct by police officers, prosecutors, and judges, the Giglio List is best understood from the perspective of a juror. “If you're a juror,” he said, “you're being asked to make a serious decision—one that could send someone to prison for life. You have to be sure, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the person is guilty. But if you can't trust the person giving you the information—like the officer testifying—how are you supposed to do your job?”

The records show that officers included on the list were cited for filing false reports, stealing during traffic stops, or general incompetence. One officer was added after allegedly posting a crime-scene photo of a suicide on Facebook; another was arrested for disorderly conduct while off duty in an incident where he reportedly pushed a police horse.

Police misconduct investigations like this are often shielded from public view, with departments frequently citing privacy laws to deny access to internal records. In 2017, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department secretly investigated a Los Angeles Times reporter for at least three years after she published a story based on a leaked list of roughly 300 problem deputies. In Kansas City, Kansas, the police department asserts that Giglio Lists are not subject to disclosure, as they considered confidential personnel records.

While prosecutors are legally obligated to disclose Giglio material to the defense, it's often difficult to know whether they're actually fulfilling that responsibility. Public defenders have long argued that prosecutors routinely withhold exculpatory evidence. Prosecutors, in turn, claim that police departments don't always share that information with them—making it hard to disclose what they don't know exists.

Nevertheless, violating the Giglio rule can carry serious consequences. If a violation is uncovered during trial, a judge can declare a mistrial or bar prosecutors from using evidence tainted by the withheld information. More often, though, evidence of officer misconduct surfaces after a conviction—fueling appeals that seek to overturn guilty verdicts. That's what happened in Chicago, where misconduct by officer Ronald Watts led to dozens of exonerations—including 15 men whose convictions were thrown out after they said Watts framed them for refusing to pay him off.

In the case of KCKPD, it remains unclear how many officers on the Giglio List testified in criminal trials or how many convictions may have relied on their testimony. In response to detailed questions and a request for comment, Jonathan Carter, public information officer for the Wyandotte County District Attorney's Office, wrote in an email that defense attorneys are given information about Giglio officers “on a case-by-case basis” and that it's up to law enforcement to provide information about officers with Giglio issues. “If the District Attorney's Office believes an officer has veracity issues,” he wrote, “we will not call that officer to the stand in a criminal case.”

Carter declined to answer whether any of the 62 officers on the list have ever been called to testify in court.

The leak of KCKPD's Giglio List can be traced back to Golubski's past transgressions. It was found in a folder labeled “Lamonte McIntyre Discovery,” part of a wrongful imprisonment civil case McIntyre brought against the department and the Unified Government, which was ultimately settled for $12.5 million in June 2022. McIntyre, who spent 23 years in prison for a double homicide he didn't commit, claimed Golubski framed him for the murders. McIntyre's 2017 exoneration triggered the FBI's investigation into Golubski's behavior, including a long history of allegedly sexually assaulting Black women.

Golubski later pleaded not guilty to the federal charges and, during a deposition in the civil case, invoked the Fifth Amendment 555 times.

As part of the discovery process in McIntyre's lawsuit, records show that the district attorney requested the Giglio List. In response, the department provided the district attorney with a ""Veracity Disclosure Lists"" that took the form of photocopied spreadsheets, dating from October 2014 to 2020. These spreadsheets include officers' names, badge numbers, and internal investigation numbers.

According to files obtained through the data breach, Golubski was added to the Giglio List due to a 1978 incident. While details in the leaked documents are limited, they likely reference a highly publicized case involving the death of 41-year-old Kenneth Borg, who died after Golubski reportedly struck him with a nightstick. These records suggest that the department had long-standing concerns about Golubski's integrity, predating the wrongful conviction of Lamonte McIntyre by decades, but the Borg incident didn't hurt Golubski's career. He retired in 2010 as captain of the homicide unit.

Other officers on the Giglio List have transgressions that range from relatively minor issues, like lying to supervisors or general incompetence, to far more serious misconduct, such as falsifying police reports, domestic violence, or excessive force—often, it's the act of lying to internal investigators about the misconduct that ultimately gets them on the list.

The records show, for instance, that former Officer Chris Johnson was placed on the Giglio List for misconduct stemming from a 2006 incident where he admitted to having sex with a confidential informant he recruited. The following year, former Officer Curtis Murphy was accused of making sexual advances on a domestic violence victim. According to internal records, the woman told investigators that Murphy asked her to undress to examine her bruises while making sexually explicit remarks. “How can I say no if authority ask me that?” she said. Murphy was also added to the list.

Neither Johnson nor Murphy responded to requests for comment.

Mark Glaspie was placed on the Giglio List for a 1992 incident in which he allegedly struck a man in the head and groin with a flashlight, then put a gun to the man's head and threatened to kill him. Despite this, he stayed with the department for years and was eventually promoted to captain.

Glaspie did not respond to a request for comment.

Some officers were quickly fired for misconduct, only to be reinstated. Others on the list have since taken positions with nearby law enforcement agencies. Officer Steven Haulmark's disciplinary file includes a long history of misconduct investigations, some of which were sustained, including improper home searches. According to his record, he was terminated by the department in 2003 but was later reinstated. He now serves as the chief of police in Great Bend, Kansas.

Haulmark did not respond to a request for comment.

Seventeen officers like Gardner are still with the department or have risen through the ranks. Gregg Dorsett was initially fired in 2018 and placed on the Giglio List for incompetence and misleading investigators during a probe into an incident where he allegedly threw a shoe at a moving vehicle, shattering the driver's side mirror and injuring the driver. His disciplinary records show, however, that soon after his termination, Dorsett was reinstated and continued to be investigated for his misconduct.

Years later, the department investigated Dorsett after his name appeared in a leak of Oath Keepers members, a far-right militia group involved in the January 6 riot in the US Capitol. According to hacked documents, the department checked Dorsett's daily attendance sheets to confirm that he had not been at the Capitol on January 6. In an interview with internal investigators, however, he admitted to being a one-time member of the Oath Keepers. Dorsett, who did not respond to a request for comment, remains a captain in the department today.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Curious Case of the Bizarre, Disappearing Captcha","https://www.wired.com/story/bizarre-disappearing-captcha/","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

As I browse the web in 2025, I rarely encounter captchas anymore. There's no slanted text to discern. No image grid of stoplights to identify.

And on the rare occasion that I am asked to complete some bot-deterring task, the experience almost always feels surreal. A colleague shared recent tests where they were presented with images of dogs and ducks wearing hats, from bowler caps to French berets. The security questions ignored the animal's hats, rudely, asking them to select the photos that showed animals with four legs.

Other puzzles are hyper-specific to their audience. For example, the captcha for Sniffies, a gay hookup site, has users slide a jockstrap across their smartphone screen to find the matching pair of underwear.

So, where have all the captchas gone? And why are the few existing challenges so damn weird? I spoke with cybersecurity experts to better understand the current state of these vanishing challenges and why the future will probably look even more peculiar.

“When the captcha was first invented, the idea was that this was literally a task a computer could not do,” says Reid Tatoris, who leads Cloudflare's application security detection team. The term captcha—Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart—was coined by researchers in 2003 and presented as a way to protect websites from malicious, nonhuman users.

The initial test most users saw online contained funky characters, usually a combo of warped letters and numbers you had to replicate by typing them into a text field. Computers couldn't see what the characters were; humans could, even if most of us had to squint to get it right.

Financial companies like PayPal and email providers like Yahoo used this iteration to ward off automated bots. More websites eventually added audio readouts of the correct answer after receiving pressure from Blind and low-vision advocacy groups, whose members were indeed humans browsing the web but could not complete a vision-based challenge.

What if, rather than just a test to keep out bots, the challenge could generate useful data? That was a core idea behind the release of reCaptcha in 2007. With reCaptcha, users identified words that machine learning algorithms could not read at the time. This sped up the process of transferring print media into an online form. The tech was quickly acquired by Google, and reCaptcha was instrumental in the company's efforts to digitize books.

As machine learning capabilities improved—and they learned to read funky text—online security checkpoints adapted to be more difficult for malicious bots to circumvent. The next iteration reCaptcha challenges included grids of images where users were asked to select specific options, like photos containing a motorcyclist. Google used the data collected here to improve its online maps.

At the same time as the difficulty of online security challenges ramped up, so did users' frustration as they were asked increasingly complex and esoteric questions to prove their humanity. Online users were asked to select all of the “smiling dogs” in image labeling questions from hCaptcha, a privacy-focused alternative to Google's service. How baffling!

Google's launch of reCaptcha v3 in 2018 was a major shift toward decreasing how often people see challenges at all online.

“Instead of interrupting a user, our technology analyzes signals and behavior during an interaction to generate a risk score on which actions can be taken by the website owner,” says Tim Knudsen, a director of product management at Google Cloud, in an email to WIRED. This switch, which accurately sniffed for which users were flesh and which were silicon, made this generation of bot-blocking tech “completely invisible” for most web surfers.

A few years later, in 2022, Cloudflare dropped Turnstile, another reCaptcha alternative. It was an additional major move away from human-completed tests and toward pattern-based usage analysis. Similar to the standard version of reCaptcha, Turnstile can be added to websites for free.

You might not remember the name, but you've likely encountered one of these Turnstile challenges before. It's the random-seeming request to click on a box to prove you're human.

On the user end, Turnstile appears sometimes as a basic checkbox, but it's more complicated than that. “Clicking the button doesn't at all mean you pass,” says Tatoris. “That is a way for us to gather more information from the client, from the device, from the software to figure out what's going on.” After gathering data, then a decision is made about whether the user is allowed to access the site.

Leading companies have a clear reason for the gratis implementation of their security software. “Cloudflare gives Turnstile away for free to the whole internet because we want more training data,” says Tatoris. “We see 20 percent of all HTTP requests across the internet. So, getting that massive training data set helps us know what a human looks like on the page versus what a bot does.”

Google's Knudsen says he anticipates visual challenges to stick around but continue becoming a less critical and less frequent aspect of website protection.

Even though most bot-deterring methods no longer need much input on the user end, if any at all, the unhinged captcha lives on, even as a rarity.

Another, more recent, entry into the captcha game is Arkose Labs, and the security company's paid MatchKey service isn't necessarily about blocking bots at all. “We have challenges which are what you would define as a captcha as one of our products,” says Kevin Gosschalk, Arkose's CEO and founder. “But the intent is to be cost-proofing, not human-proofing.”

The goal of his challenges is to make it so expensive to attack a website that it's no longer a profitable endeavor. The puzzles are tailored to disincentivize attacks within specific contexts. For example, if someone is getting paid to solve security challenges manually, Arkose may detect that and serve them a time-intensive task to complete and occasionally reject their answer no matter what.

As part of Arkose's “cost-proofing” measures, the company also sells a version of MatchKey designed to thwart attacks coming from people using large language models or other generative AI tools. “You defeat an LLM by giving it novel, unusual things that it has no business knowing or have previously been asked,” says Gosschalk. He gives an example of having users answer questions about a strange collage, like a fake photo of a frog in a pond that has the head of a bird and the reflection of a horse. The mishmashed image is not something that an AI model has likely seen before.

For the odd cases when you do still encounter an online security challenge in the coming months and years, don't expect the puzzles ever to return to that initial iteration. Goodbye distorted jumble of letters and numbers, I didn't realize I'd miss you until you were already gone.

Familiar challenge structures may also eventually go by the wayside. “While the classic visual puzzle is well-known, we are actively introducing new challenge types—like prompting a user to scan a QR code or perform a specific hand gesture,” says Google's Knudsen. This allows the company to still add friction without confusing the user with an impossible task.

The success of security measures like these is not wholly measured in stopping existing threats to websites. It hinges on how fast companies can detect and prevent the ever-shifting waves of nascent attacks. “We know that the new detections will have to spin up two years from now are totally different from what we have in place now,” says Cloudflare's Tatoris.

Whatever comes next for security challenges, with their increasing weirdness and behind-the-scenes signals, I just hope I'm always able to prove my humanness online. I've never been that good at taking tests.

Chicago always has something to prove. When it went up against New York for the 1893 World's Fair, a New York Sun reporter called out its ""windbag"" campaigners. Illinois ended up hosting the fair, and Chicago embraced its new identity as the Windy City. That chip-on-the-shoulder energy still defines this metropolis, a city that builds, innovates, and competes like it has everything to lose.

Chicago's tech scene is a diverse landscape that shouldn't be slept on—but you probably know that. Over the past decade, the Second City's tech sector has grown by 18 percent, adding more than 106,000 direct jobs and nearly 150,000 indirect jobs, according to the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce. The city's universities produce more computer science graduates than anywhere else in the country. Giants like Google, Salesforce, and Meta have expanded here, while startups like Tegus, Uber Freight, and G2 have relocated from Silicon Valley, drawn by Chicago's talent pool and more affordable cost of living.

Chicago's tech scene is not siloed; nearly half of all tech positions are tied to core industries like health care, finance, and logistics. In August, the TechChicago conference spotlighted quantum computing, energy-efficient data centers, and equitable access to capital, demonstrating that Chicago is thinking about how technology can enhance everyday life.

To be in Chicago is to work hard, play harder. Dinner in Fulton Market, drinks on the Riverwalk, and a comedy set to close out the night.

While Chicago's tech scene spans the city, chances are your work trip landed you somewhere in the Loop, River North, or West Loop area. Our lodgings keep you close, comfortable, and surrounded by fellow professionals.

363 E. Wacker Drive, (312) 787-3447

Where the Chicago River and Lake Michigan meet, the St. Regis delivers the city's pinnacle of luxury, complete with a world-class spa, fitness facilities, and acclaimed dining. The Signature Butler Service takes care of unpacking, suit pressing, shoe shines, and morning coffee (or tea), so you can focus on the business that brought you here. A complimentary house car can get you to nearby meetings or lunches within a 2-mile radius. Start with the Tokyo Breakfast at Japanese restaurant Miru, return at 5 pm for the hotel's daily champagne sabrage, then head to Tre Dita for handmade pasta and Tuscan wood-fired steaks—be sure to reserve ahead.

200 N Green St., (312) 761-1700

If you want a hotel that feels like part of the city, it's the Hoxton in the West Loop. Check in and out anytime when you book directly. Workspaces are available, from library desks to coworking spaces and meeting rooms. If you're hungry, the on-site café serves Aya Bakery pastries and coffee, and if you need a break, daybeds await, which are ideal for a power nap or nursing a hangover. Weather permitting, their outdoor terraces double as another place to get work done. You don't even have to leave the Hoxton to hit the neighborhood's hottest dining and drinking spots; Cira serves Mediterranean-inspired eats all day, Cabra Cevicheria dishes Peruvian bites on the rooftop, head downstairs to Lazy Bird for cocktails and live music Thursday through Saturday, and Milk Bar is also in-house for a late-night sugar fix.

311 N Morgan St., (312) 764-1919

In Fulton Market, the Emily Hotel is perfect for travelers who want a local vibe with all the luxuries and tech conveniences. Grab a coffee at the in-house coffee bar, lunch at Fora, cocktails at rooftop bar Selva, and dinner at Sushi by Bou. Stay active in the 24/7 fitness center, and if the weather permits, catch a film at the hotel's terrace cinema.

900 E Grand, (872) 710-5700

At Sable, you'll have everything you need for an enjoyable stay. Grab a coffee in the lobby at Kisbi, where single-origin beans from Costa Rica, Kenya, and Ethiopia make your morning feel instantly richer. Lirica, the Spanish- and Iberian-inspired restaurant, is perfect for a solo lunch or team dinner. The Offshore Rooftop has unbeatable views of the skyline and Lake Michigan, plus a full-service bar. As for amenities, there's a 24-hour fitness center, meeting rooms if you need to get work done, and, of course, Navy Pier itself just outside your door—full shops, restaurants, and attractions to keep you entertained. It's a bit like living in a mall.

505 N Michigan Ave., (312) 944-4100

In the heart of the Magnificent Mile, the InterContinental blends big-city business energy with old-school glamour. That's partially thanks to its indoor pool, a 1929 stunner tiled in Spanish Majolica and watched over by a terracotta Neptune fountain, floating 14 stories above Michigan Avenue. During the week, you'll mostly see business travelers, though families often stay here, too. The practical amenities are covered, including meeting rooms, printing services, and even a notary, if needed. There are two on-site restaurants: Casa Chi leans Japanese Peruvian with great cocktails, and Michael Jordan's Steakhouse is exactly what you think. There's also a Starbucks in the lobby, but with so many better local cafés nearby, it's worth wandering out.

You can work from any of the hotels on our list, but if you need a change of scenery, Chicago has plenty of coworking options, too. Below are some of our favorites, and Deskpass is a great resource for more options.

20 N. Wacker Drive, 12th Floor

Inside the Civic Opera Building in the city's business district, this 60,000-square-foot workspace is designed for tech professionals. Fast Wi-Fi, ergonomic setups, meeting rooms, and even a rooftop terrace and fitness center. Drop in for $35 a day on Deskpass.

3130 N Rockwell St.

In Avondale, Guild Row offers a sunlit workspace with high ceilings, private Zoom booths, and a café and bar for breaks. The Belmont Room hosts workshops, talks, and events, but the overall atmosphere is calm and focused for getting work done without distractions. It's a space to recharge, meet like-minded people, or settle in for a productive day. You can purchase a day pass for $28.

1821 W Hubbard St Unit 209

In the West Loop, Art/Work Coworking is a creative lab that draws in the city's creatives, techies, and freelancers. Open 24/7 with automated access, it offers desks and bookable meeting rooms. Drop in with Deskpass, or book a conference room starting at $50 an hour.

112 N Green St.

If you need a reliable off-site work spot, Sawada Coffee has plenty of seats, strong Wi-Fi, and strong coffee. Founded by Japanese barista Hiroshi Sawada, Sawada Coffee is renowned for the Military Latte—a rich jolt of matcha, espresso, and cocoa—but they also have cortados, cappuccinos, and cookies on hand to keep the workflow steady. If you linger into lunch, you don't have to go far; Sawada shares its space with Green Street Smoked Meats, known for its Central Texas–style barbecue.

714 N Wells St.

Owned by Palestinian American friends, Oud Coffee is a River North favorite for craft lattes and bites. The signature Oud latte blends pistachio syrup, cardamom spice, and fresh mint, while the menu also includes Turkish coffee, tea, and smoothies. Snack on Manakeesh flatbread, stuffed dates, or baklava. Spacious indoor seating makes it a solid spot to catch up on work, or sit outside if the weather permits. There's another location in Wicker Park, should you find yourself closer to that neighborhood.

5531 N Clark St.

The Understudy is a theater-bookstore-slash-café, with passion fruit syrup on offer alongside lavender, wild rose petal, and hazelnut. Non-coffee drinkers can sip iced ube lattes, sparkling matcha lemonades, or a lychee roasted goddess tea. Come for the flavor, stay for the creative atmosphere, with light-filled nooks that make it easy to lose an afternoon.

3101 S Morgan St.

Bridgeport Coffee has been roasting on the South Side since 2004, and it's still one of the city's best stops for a cup of coffee that actually tastes like where it came from. The shop sources beans directly from growers, cutting out middlemen for better flavor and fairer trade. There are only a couple of counter seats and a handful of tables, but it's a cozy place to work if you snag a spot.

Chances are, Chicago's hottest eateries will be booked solid, but we've found the sweet spots that actually have availability.

2165 N Western Ave.

For a kitschy yet upscale take on the American Chinese takeout you grew up on, Chef's Special delivers saucy, family-style classics. Think orange chicken, Mongolian beef, and lo mein noodles—fast. The nostalgic comfort food is paired with tropical cocktails, from a lemongrass gimlet to an $8 shot-and-beer combo. Ideal for small teams or clients, the menu encourages sampling, making it less about individual plates and more about the experience.

800 W Randolph St.

At Au Cheval, Chicago's über-celebrated burger joint, the melty, egg-topped cheeseburger lives up to its hype. The vibe is low-key, with a diner-meets-French-speakeasy feel, featuring dim lighting, leather booths, and an open kitchen that's always at full capacity. You have to get the cheeseburger, but the chilaquiles and roasted bone marrow are also worth ordering. There are no reservations; swing by on a weekday afternoon, put your name down, and grab a drink at one of Fulton Market's many bars while you wait.

2024 N Halsted St.

Cafe Ba Ba Reeba! has been the city's tapas spot; the menu leans on shareable plates that pair well with pitchers of sangria: pintxos, tapas, and paella. The Lincoln Park location buzzes with energy, but if you can't snag a reservation, the sister outpost Lil' Ba-Ba-Reeba! is in River North and offers a similar vibe. Ideal for team dinners or client meetings.

700 N Clark St.

Ambar is inspired by the communal Balkan tradition of “Voz,” where food is brought out to the table in a continuous procession. For a set price, you can order from more than 40 Balkan dishes. Grilled meats, slow-cooked seafood, stuffed pies, cheesy flatbreads, creamy spreads, and desserts I keep coming back for. Everything comes in small plates, so you can order seconds (or thirds) of your favorite dishes without shame. For visiting execs, the all-you-can-eat model is a chance to entertain colleagues without the hassle of menu math, and the abundance keeps the conversation flowing.

Ask any Chicagoan, and they will insist that Chicago pizza is actually a crispy, tavern-style pie. But if you must try deep-dish pizza, skip the touristy Lou Malnati's and get Pequod's instead. For Chicago-style pizza, some local favorites are Paulie Gee's, Professor Pizza, and—my personal favorite—Zarella Pizzeria & Taverna, which offers both thin artisan and tavern-style pizza. If you manage to snag a reservation, order the Spicy Vodka pizza, the gooey mozzarella sticks, and the pineapple brown butter cake. You can thank me later.

Portillo's is for tourists. If you want a real Chicago dog, head to Superdawg or the Wieners Circle.

Chicago drinks hard. Survive your first Malört shot at the stickiest dive bar you can find, then check out the city's barcades and breweries, where you can unwind, catch up with colleagues, or just enjoy the city.

1221 W Blackhawk St.

I love grabbing a drink at the Goose Island Pub before catching a show at the Salt Shed. On sunny days, the riverside patio and skyline views are so serene. Inside, it's industrial but comfortable, lively enough to still feel connected to the city. The tap list mixes Goose Island classics with experimental brews, barrel-aged bourbon, and seasonal rotations. Goose Island's main taproom in West Town is also worth a visit if you're in the area, but the Salt Shed venue has a built-in concert ambiance that makes it the perfect pregame joint.

213 W Institute Pl.

Downtown Chicago doesn't overflow with true barcades, but Headquarters Beercade scratches the itch. The draw is the dozens of arcade cabinets and a decent lineup of Stern pinball machines, all on free play, yet the vibe skews more corporate happy hour than underground gamer hangout. If you want to sip on craft beer while mashing buttons on Street Fighter II, this is the place.

839 W Fulton Market

With three locations across the city, you won't have to go far to find Emporium. Wicker Park is usually the busiest, and the West Loop location is a perfect stop before dinner at Au Cheval. Expect skee-ball, pinball, and pool tables running on tokens, plus a drink menu that rotates in local brews and seasonal hard kombuchas. Don't count on every machine working, but Emporium is less about high scores and more about blowing off steam over a beer; the games are just a bonus.

3540 N Clark St.

Sluggers has been a Chicago staple for over 35 years. With over 40 TVs streaming games, and walls stacked with sports memorabilia, it's the liveliest sports bar in the city. Upstairs, you'll find batting cages, skee-ball, and other arcade games.

2833 N Sheffield Ave.

Replay in Lincoln Park is a dive-bar-meets-party with a lineup of rotating craft beer and cheeky cocktails like “Shrek Is Love” and “Not My Gumdrop Buttons.” Most arcade games are free to play, with the newest Stern machines reasonably priced. There's always a theme that leans into '90s nostalgia, and weekend DJs keep the energy high. The crowd is cool, diverse, and unmistakably Midwestern. This is reviewer Louryn Strampe's go-to spot for pinball and beer before catching a show at the Point.

You haven't really done Chicago until you've laughed through its comedy scene, home to the legends of both stand-up and improv.

230 W North Ave.

Second City is the birthplace of improvisational comedy, not to mention that it has launched more SNL cast members than you can count (Dan Aykroyd, Tina Fey, Bill Murray, Amy Poehler … I can go on). You can't go wrong with the mainstage show, but the lineup branches out into family-friendly matinees, late-night experiments, and seasonal sets. If one show sells out, there's always another around the corner—literally, the venue runs multiple stages at once.

1548 N Wells St.

Zanies is as classic as it gets for stand-up, where legends and up-and-comers share the same tiny stage. It has a low-ceilinged, brick-wall intimacy that feels exclusive. On weekends, you might catch a touring comic; on weeknights, it's roast battles, showcases, and the kind of rowdy energy that feels more underground than you'd expect from a venue this iconic.

3175 N Broadway

Sure, this isn't the OG comedy club on Sunset Boulevard, but Chicago's Laugh Factory has carved out its own scene. The vibe is more Midwestern grit and quick wit, and the rainbow-arched stage is just as legendary in person. The “Chicago's Best Standup” nights rotate through the city's local comics, and you never know when a bigger name will drop in unannounced. You'll also find open mics and themed shows that keep nights unpredictable.

1331 N. Milwaukee Ave.

In Wicker Park, the Den Theatre hosts both comedy shows and theater productions, with multiple black box stages and cabaret setups tucked into its brick-and-beam interior. The shows range from local stand-ups testing new material to nationally touring headliners dropping in for intimate sets. Between shows, the lounge and bar make it easy to linger and take photos with the talent.

By the standards of the San Francisco Bay Area's hard left, Casey Goonan's crimes were unremarkable. A police SUV partially burned by an incendiary device on UC Berkeley's campus. A planter of shrubs lit on fire after Goonan unsuccessfully tried to smash a glass office window and throw a firebomb into the federal building in downtown Oakland.

But thanks to a series of communiques where Goonan claimed to have carried out the summer 2024 attacks in solidarity with Hamas and the East Bay native's anarchist beliefs, federal prosecutors claimed Goonan “intended to promote” terrorism on top of a felony count for using an incendiary device. Goonan's original charges notably did not contain terrorism counts. In late September, US District Court Judge Jeffrey White sentenced Goonan, whom they called “a domestic terrorist” during the hearing, to 19 and a half years in prison plus 15 years probation. Prosecutors also asked that he be sent to the Bureau of Prisons facility that contains a Communications Management Units, a highly restrictive assignment reserved for what the government claims are “extremist” inmates with terrorism-related offenses or affiliations.

Although Goonan's case began under the Biden Administration, it offers a glimpse of the approach the Department of Justice may take in President Donald Trump's forthcoming offensive against the “left,” formalized in late September in National Security Presidential Memorandum 7 (NSPM-7), an executive order targeting anti-fascist beliefs, opposition towards Immigrations and Customs Enforcement raids, and criticism of capitalism and Christianity as potential “indicators of terrorism.”

In addition to Goonan's purported admiration for Hamas—a designated terrorist organization since 1997—and cofounding of True Leap, a tiny Anarchist publisher, the 35-year-old doctorate in African-American Studies' biography includes another trait being targeted by the Trump administration and its allies: Goonan identifies as a transgender person. While NPSM-7 cites “extremism migration, race, and gender” as an indicator of “this pattern of violent and terroristic tendencies,” the Heritage Foundation has attempted to link gender-fluid identity to mass shootings and is urging the FBI to create a new, specious domestic terrorism classification of “Transgender Ideology-Inspired Violent Extremism,” or TIVE.

The executive order, meanwhile, directs the American security state's sprawling post-9/11 counterterrorism apparatus to be reoriented away from neo-Nazis, Proud Boys, white nationalists, Christian nationalists, and other extreme right-wing actors that have been overwhelmingly responsible for the majority of political violence in the past few decades, and towards opponents of ICE, anti-fascists, and the administration writ large. Along with potentially violent actors, NSPM-7 instructs federal law enforcement to scrutinize nonprofit groups and philanthropic foundations involved in funding organizations that espouse amorphous ideologies, from “support for the overthrow of the United States Government” to expressing “hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.”

“NSPM-7 is the natural culmination of ‘radicalization theory' as the basis for the American approach to counterterrorism,” says Mike German, a retired FBI agent who spent years infiltrating violent white supremacist groups and quit the Bureau in response to its post-9/11 shift in terrorism strategy. German explored radicalization theory's trajectory in his 2019 book, Disrupt, Discredit and Divide: How the New FBI Damages Democracy.

Radicalization theory attempts to establish a logic of progression by terrorists from introduction to a particular ideology through political and social activism, ending with targeted violence.

“When I worked domestic terrorism in the 1990s, the ‘radicalization' theory was discredited, and it was resurrected after September 11,” German says. The theory centers on excising “bad ideas” from the broader political body and neutralizing the voices of dissident figures who may inspire and possibly radicalize others—which, according to sentencing filings, is precisely how federal prosecutors view Goonan.

“Thanks to that framework, they can target anyone they choose,” German says. “And because of this logic, they've constructed where bad ideas necessitate mass surveillance, financial scrutiny, and disruption. The paradigm that was initially aimed at Al Qaeda is now being directed towards mainstream Americans, mainstream ideas, and mainstream political parties.”

Sentencing records make clear that Goonan's political convictions began moving away from the American mainstream long before their weeklong spree of direct action in the late spring of 2024. The former high school baseball standout began to get immersed in the East Bay's radical political circles after suffering an injury in junior college, then continued their intellectual journey during their undergraduate studies at UC-Riverside and in a doctoral program at Chicago's Northwestern University.

Israel's brutal response to the October 7, 2023 attacks, deemed genocidal by an independent commission at the United Nations, appalled Goonan, and they went headfirst into Palestinian solidarity activism in the East Bay. The Gaza solidarity encampment at UC Berkeley caught Goonan's attention in spring 2024, and they became an active participant in that movement. Court records indicate this was a particularly challenging time, with Goonan suffering serious hypoglycemic episodes from their Type I diabetes and also being involuntarily hospitalized on a mental health hold and formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder, according to court documents.

“I am not an arsonist but an activist who in a manic fit of rage and desperation committed arson,” Goonan wrote in a September 13 letter to Judge White ahead of sentencing.

When the UC Berkeley solidarity encampment quietly disbanded in late May—a stark contrast to violence inflicted on other campuses by police and pro-Zionist vigilantes—Goonan, per court records, decided to mount a one-person direct action campaign they entitled, “Operation Campus Flood.” Federal prosecutors claim Goonan made explicit reference to Hamas' name for the October 7 operations (al-Aqsa Flood) and referenced a propaganda pamphlet FBI agents found in Goonan's family residence narrating Hamas' justification for their decision to attack Israel.

These factors, outlined in the government's sentencing memo plus Goonan's online communiques after the arsons urging others to follow their example, their desire to publish writings on the rationale behind their actions, and their purported attempt to use legal mail to conceal communications from the authority underpinned the prosecution's request that Goonan be housed in BOP's highly restrictive unit.

“Even after being arrested and pleading guilty to his crimes, he has refused to show any remorse and in fact has taken substantial steps to continue to publicize his actions and recruit others to his cause,” assistant US attorney Nikhil Bhagat wrote in a September 18 filing. “The defendant is a highly educated, unrepentant domestic terrorist who sought to use violence against law enforcement officers and the federal government.”

The Communications Management Units, created by the George W. Bush Administration, have been criticized for contributing to the ongoing radicalization of inmates. There is only one such unit left in the federal prison system, at FCI Cumberland, where a combination of radical Islamists, neo-Nazis, and left-affiliated prisoners are currently being held. The two other CMUs, at FCI Marion and FCI Terre Haute, were closed within the past year, according to court records.

Sarah Potter, Goonan's defense attorney, tells WIRED that the government's demands for a heavy sentence came once Goonan had reached a plea agreement on January 14, 2025 (Before Trump's inauguration) that limited their sentence to 20 years. When they got hold of Goonan's jail correspondence, Potter says, they had expanded their concept of his radicalization from earlier anarchist beliefs to Islamist terrorism. “By the time we got to sentencing, they were drawing a much closer and clearer connection to Hamas,” Potter says. “The main core of their beliefs is anti-oppression in various aspects, whether that's racial oppression, prisons, or other marginalized groups.”

The potential assignment to a CMU—which will be a unilateral decision by federal prison authorities—alarms Potter considering Goonan's Type I diabetes and documented history and episodes, per court documents, of severe mental health episodes. “Their comments at sentencing were designed to paint Casey as a dangerous ringleader, who if allowed to have free communication would continue to present a true threat of violence to the country,” Potter says.

In addition, Potter believes federal law enforcement's ongoing attempt to unseal Goonan's correspondence with the Transgender Law Center, which could represent Goonan should they decide to become party to the TLC's class action lawsuit brought by transgender inmates against BOP and the Trump Administration, represents a unique and undefined threat. Even though Goonan's case is formally closed and he is already in FCI Mendota awaiting assignment to another prison, Potter and federal prosecutors are still sparring in court filings about divulging Goonan's confidential legal correspondence with the TLC to USDOJ.

“TLC has filed a class action over gender-affirming healthcare against BOP, and the government knows that Casey might well become a client when they go into Bureau of Prisons custody,” Potter says. “The TLC and transgender Americans are clearly on the government's radar, and not in a good way.”

Should the legal services organization be targeted for promoting extremism by the Trump Administration, German, the former FBI agent, maintains that the grounds for the overarching counterterrorism strategy originated long before 2024.

“There's been a bipartisan acceptance of this kind of theory of terrorism that is often unconnected and unrelated from acts of violence,” German says. “NSPM-7 is a natural culmination of the adoption of this radicalization theory over 20 years as the basis for counterterrorism, and the government can target anyone they choose.”

Making a full Thanksgiving feast for guests can be daunting, for some perhaps even terrifying. The world, and especially Hallmark movies, is full of holiday disaster stories: burnt turkeys, failed desserts, steamed hams. But I'm not bragging when I say that the first Thanksgiving dinner I prepared for my extended family—a little early, this year—was an unmitigated success.

My aunt couldn't stop talking about the black pepper in the biscuits and the sage on the carrots. My uncle went in for the turkey and the apple-sausage stuffing. My father didn't speak at all, unless prompted. He just ate and ate. This was a compliment.

But of course, I had cheated. I had ordered my Thanksgiving in the mail—one of the new breed of Thanksgiving meal kits.

The meal was genuinely home-cooked, of course, prepared mostly from scratch. But the entire seven-platter feast—its ingredients and recipes—had arrived two days before, in a box large enough to house a primal cut of beef. It was Thanksgiving in a box: a $200 “Chef's Table Thanksgiving” meal kit available from sister meal delivery plans Sunbasket and Gobble.

The spread from Sunbasket was vast and generous. The table contained a nearly 3-pound roast of turkey, mounds of mashed potato, pebbled cranberry compote, roasted carrots dressed in miso-sage butter, brussels sprouts dappled with pecorino romano and pancetta, an endless platter of fennel-apple-sausage-stuffing, Gruyère black-pepper biscuits caked more than an inch tall, a tureen of deep brown turkey gravy, a ginger apple crisp waiting in the wings.

Sunbasket is among a new bounty of meal kit companies that aim to ease the stress of the holidays by doing the planning and the shopping for you—big meal boxes tailor-made for those who still want to make a home-cooked meal but for whom the prospect of planning a vast and complicated feast is prohibitive.

Here was my experience with Sunbasket—and some of the other Thanksgiving meal delivery options to get your whole Thanksgiving meal delivered to your home.

Sunbasket

Sunbasket (Chef's Table)

Somehow I managed to slip past the age of 40 without ever preparing a full holiday feast. In part, I have lived an adult life of Friendsgiving potlucks and Chinatown feasts. But in part, I have been lucky. Well into my midlife, my parents still have the whole extended brood over for the holidays—asking that we bring just a salad, a side, a dessert. I generally bring random experiments: a queso de bola cheesecake, say, or a Hungarian mushroom soup from a local chef's recipe.

A Thanksgiving box from Sunbasket was a chance to pay them back, a little, by making a full Thanksgiving feast—which I cooked side by side with my mother. Heartwarming, I know.

The meal box arrives neatly arranged in an insulated box, with each dish wrapped in a paper bag and a stack of recipes and instructions on top. Order by November 19, and boxes arrive between November 23 and November 26. You'll want two days ahead of your meal for the turkey to thaw in the fridge, or you'll have to speed up the process with a cold water bath. And save most of a shelf in your fridge for the various dishes.

While it might save on stress and planning, the meal box was far from labor-free. Sunbasket says to expect 2.5 hours of prep. As with all meal kits and all recipe writers, they're lying. But not by much! With a double oven, or a good accessory oven like a big Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro, two people can get clear in barely more than three hours. If you're working solo, you'll definitely want to prep the stuffing and the apple crisp the night before. One oven only, or one person only, and you're probably looking at four hours of total prep.

You'll also need a wealth of serving dishes and platters—though this is to be expected when cooking seven dishes.

Now for the good news: The Sunbasket meal, without being at all difficult or advanced in terms of prep requirements, is far more extravagant than I would have managed or attempted on my own. As with most meal kits, the difference comes down to the premixed spices and sauces and seasonings.

With spices and sauces mostly premixed, and turkey drippings conveniently bagged up, the meal still amounts to a lot of helpful shortcuts, while offering a sense of accomplishment: Three hours of cooking is enough to earn bragging rights, and to accept your aunt's praise on those black-pepper biscuits.

The mashed potatoes required mere microwaving, but they were still potatoes—not dehydrated powder. The gravy involved mixing a stock and a bag of turkey drippings. The turkey was a brined roast of turkey breast, an easy oven-bake still in its bag.

Mostly, it was the sides that required involved heftier preparation. Stuffing was a more scratch-made process than even my mother would generally favor: It began with chopping baguette loaves and toasting them into croutons, before dicing fresh fennel, apple, and celery and cooking it down with sausage and drippings, then baking the whole mess together. Brussels sprouts involve crisping up pancetta and chopping a wealth of hazelnuts. For carrots, one must build a miso-sage butter.

The process was fairly seamless, and the kit comes with instructions to help you plan your order of operations for maximum efficiency—cooking some dishes side by side at the same temperature. The main process flaw was that the meal relies too heavily on the oven, with no stovetop dishes, which means you do a lot of waiting for the oven—even when you've got a double oven. A couple stovetop sides could have streamlined the whole process. Some dishes, in particular the carrots, took longer to cook fully than the directions indicated.

But the results were in fact delicious, with hardly a bum dish. Though I generally favor dark meat on a turkey, the breast was brined to seemingly eternal moistness, without being oversalted. And the portions were unusually generous. Nominally, the Sunbasket meal feeds a mere four or six people. But whoever decided this must have an impressively hungry family: football players, Olympic swimmers, or preteen boys. With five at the table, we didn't get through much more than half. Realistically, eight could fill themselves silly.

At $200 for the Chef's Classic Meal, this remains far from inexpensive for a meal you still must cook yourself—though seven-dish meals rarely come cheap. You can shave off dessert and those biscuits and get the meal for a small price break, just $20 less. But I wouldn't personally do so. The pepper-Gruyère biscuits and the apple crisp were two of the more popular items.

As the meal started, all conversation ceased for a moment as everyone dug heartily in—until my mother finally broke the silence by prodding my father to comment on the food.

“It's for an article,” she said. “You have to tell him how it is.”

“Everything's great,” my father said, finally. ""No complaints."" So there you have it.

Boarderie

Boarderie (Large)

Boarderie (Medium)

Boarderie (Classic)

As a middle-aged person for whom cheese remains one of the few consistent joys, I find myself putting together a lot of charcuterie boards. For holidays, for parties at my house, for parties at others' houses, or even just for quick dinners. Regardless of the board size, the costs can add up fast, especially once you've factored in frills like pickles, dried fruit, chocolate, and chutneys. To say nothing of the time outlay for slicing and arranging. Which is why, this Thanksgiving, I'm skipping the appetizer stress and going to Boarderie, the mail-order instant charcuterie board hyped by Shark Tank shark Lori Grenier.

I recently tried one of the brand's fall-themed boards in lieu of making my own, and for larger events, I don't think I will ever DIY again. The tray was stunning; it was both delicious and would have taken me ages to source on my own. Boarderie boards are shipped overnight, and mine arrived fresh with still partially frozen ice packs, despite sitting on my porch for half an afternoon. The large size came with 37 components, including 15 cheeses (fig-and-rose goat cheese, wasabi horseradish cheddar), four meats (black truffle salami, chorizo), five kinds of nuts, eight fruits and pickles, and three boxes of different types of crackers. There were also marmalades and candies and a disposable set of bamboo picks, spoons, and tongs.

All of it came shrink-wrapped in its own sections, in little bamboo and/or cardboard boats set into a reusable acacia wood tray. All I had to do was unwrap the sections and arrange the crackers. There are three different board sizes (Classic serves 2-3, Medium serves 4-5, and Large serves 9-10, which I found to be accurate so long as the board is being used as an appetizer and not a meal), as well as holiday themes and customizable cheese numbers and letters. There's also the option for add-ons like baked brie ($129) or fresh honeycomb ($19). A bargain it is not, but if you're looking to take some of the stress out of Thanksgiving meal planning, this is sure to be a hit. —Kat Merck

We haven't yet tried the Thanksgiving items below, but these are some options from meal kits I've tried and can recommend.

For preorder between October 31 and November 11, Green Chef subscribers can sign up to get organic sides and pasture-raised turkey delivered as à la carte meal kit items. This includes a 10-to 12-pound pasture-raised turkey for $70, or an assortment of sides: cranberry brioche stuffing, orange-cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes and gravy, maple butternut squash, and broccoli gratin.

Blue Apron, one of the OG meal kits in the US, has undergone a wholesale transformation this year. One of the biggest changes is that subscriptions are no longer required, and à la carte meal ordering is possible—indeed, it's now my favorite no-subscription meal kit offering. What this means is that for this Thanksgiving, you'll be able to order individual Thanksgiving dishes to prep fresh at home.

WIRED plans to try these meals in advance when available, but individual meal kit delivery dishes will include roasted turkey breast with gravy and fresh cranberry sauce, a rosemary herb stuffing, brown butter mashed potatoes with white cheddar, breadcrumb mac and cheese, and apple crumb pie. Ordering goes live November 17 and runs through December 29.

You'll have to sign up for a meal kit subscription (likely at a hefty discount), but Martha Stewart–endorsed meal kit Marley Spoon offers maybe more Thanksgiving items than any meal kit I've seen, pickable from the menu as meal kit items. This includes an ungodly array of pies and tarts, viands from ham to duck to turkey to beef roast, an entire Thanksgiving brunch, you name it. Here's the November 17 advance menu, with 30 Thanksgiving options. Marley Spoon is my favorite meal kit, where cooking and recipe acumen are concerned: I haven't tried these individual dishes, but if you're in the market for a home Thanksgiving meal kit, November might be a good time to subscribe.

You'll have to be a subscriber (at least for the week!), but meal plan HelloFresh is offering a Thanksgiving feast that'll serve eight to 10 people for $180, available through the HelloFresh Market. This will include a whole roast turkey, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes and gravy, brioche stuffing with cranberries, apple crisp, ginger-braised carrots with pecans. These dishes are also available à la carte, alongside other sides.

Ready-to-eat meal company Factor offers a fully prepared, ready-to-heat Thanksgiving meal option for two, for couples who don't want to make a multi-course meal just for themselves. It'll be available November 22 at a $37 upcharge for existing Factor subscribers. The feast for two offers sliced sous-vide turkey breast, mashed potatoes, mushroom green beans, butternut smoked gouda mac and cheese, and a slice of pumpkin spice cheesecake.

The iPhone has a lot of settings to bolster your privacy. Apple, despite collecting a decent amount of your data, gives you more control over your privacy than your average gadget, mobile or not, but many of these settings are turned off by default.

It's easy to change that. You can lock down your location sharing, app sharing, and targeted advertising, as well as enable features that will help you find your device if it's lost or stolen. All of the settings I've rounded up are based on the latest iOS 26 version, which debuted shortly before the release of the iPhone 17. If you have an older version of iOS, certain settings may be in a different location, but the majority of iPhones should have access to most (if not all) of these settings.

Privacy is personal, so you shouldn't treat the settings I listed here as a checklist. Treat them as suggestions. Your tolerance for data collection and the individual apps you have installed will largely dictate what settings you need to change. And remember, there's some level of privacy you have to give up with any device connected to the internet, so although these settings will help your online privacy, they won't make you completely anonymous.

You've undoubtedly come across an app asking to track you, which the iPhone, thankfully, lets you deny. If you want to turn off all tracking, you can. By default, the iPhone allows apps to request to track you, following you around other apps and websites to see what you're doing. In the settings, you can automatically deny app tracking requests whenever you install a new app.

Open the Settings app, swipe down to the bottom, and choose Privacy & Security. Choose Tracking, and tick off the All Apps to Request to Track setting. You'll also see any apps you've given tracking permission to listed, and you can revoke those permissions if you want.

There are a lot of reasons you'd want to share location data with an app—for example, when using Apple or Google Maps—but apps that don't need your location might still request it. Follow the same path of Settings, then Privacy & Security, but choose Location Services after. There, you'll find all of the apps that have access to location services, their individual settings, and the option to turn off location services altogether.

I don't recommend doing that, but you can still clean things up. First, for any app that doesn't need a precise GPS signal (for instance, a retailer's app), turn off the Precise Location setting, which you can find by tapping into an app. Once that's done, choose System Services, which covers all of the functionality built into the iPhone that accesses location data.

There are a lot of settings here you probably want to leave on, such as Setting Time Zone and Cell Network Search, but there are some you can take off. At the bottom, you'll find the Product Improvement section, and you can safely turn off those settings. You can also turn off Significant Locations & Routes if you don't want your iPhone to automatically pick up your home or, for instance, your route to work.

In the same Privacy & Security menu, just below the previous two settings, you'll see a list of apps. These are apps that other apps might request access to, and you can customize those settings here. A great example is already set up on the iPhone. You'll see that the Focus app is shared with the Messages app, which is pretty useful to let your iMessage friends know that you need some time to focus.

There's some app sharing you might want to turn off. For example, the Photos app is fully shared with Google Drive on my iPhone, but I don't use Google Drive for photos. There's a ton of information that travels along with photos—metadata like the date captured and location—that I'd rather not share. Tapping in, I can change Google Drive to Limited Access to choose what I share, or I can block it outright.

By default, the iPhone doesn't share a ton of data. In fact, most settings are turned off out of the box, but there are a few analytics you'll need to dig in and turn off manually. Once again, head to the Privacy & Security menu, and swipe all the way down to the bottom. There, you'll find two settings: Analytics & Improvements and Apple Advertising.

First, analytics. Tap in, and you'll find two settings turned on: Share iPhone Analytics and Share With App Developers. Turn those off. You might find some other settings depending on what you've connected to your iPhone (like an Apple Watch), and you can turn off that analytics sharing, as well.

Next is advertising. Apple Advertising is more focused on privacy than other platforms, blocking ads from tracking you across websites and services. You can turn off the Personalized Ads toggle. You'll still get ads, but they'll be generic. If you turn on Apple Advertising, you can tap into the Ad Targeting Information screen to see what data is shared, such as your birth year, zip code, and the categories for apps you have downloaded.

This isn't really a setting, but the iPhone has built-in privacy reporting tools that can give you insight into what data apps are requesting and using. In the Privacy & Security menu, near the bottom, you'll see the App Privacy Report and Apple Intelligence Report.

For the former, you'll see the domains the app contacts each time you use it, as well as a layout of how many domains an app contacts. For Apple Intelligence, you'll see private compute requests and what data was shared with the request. This report is exported as a JSON file, and you'll need a text editor to view it. Regardless, both of these reports are fairly technical, and they don't help your privacy; they just give you more information.

Apple automatically stores and syncs anything you put in the Notes app through iCloud, so no, those random thoughts you jotted down five years ago aren't completely private. Thankfully, you can keep them private with an “On My iPhone” account, which, as the name suggests, doesn't sync your notes and keeps them local to your device.

To set it up, open Settings and go down to the bottom of the list for Apps. Find the Notes app and toggle the On My iPhone Account setting on. Just above it, you can also set a password if you want to encrypt and lock any highly sensitive notes. Remember, you won't be able to pull up these notes on another Apple device because they won't sync, and if you lose your iPhone, you may not be able to access your notes altogether without a recent backup.

You can hold down on any app icon, select Edit Home Screen, and tap an app to hide it. That'll keep the app on your phone, but it won't appear on your home screen. (You can search for it via Spotlight.) You can also hold down and select Require Face ID to lock the app, meaning it'll require biometric authorization every time you open the app.

That's great for apps, but you can do the same thing for photos, as well. Hold down on any photo in the Photos app and select Hide. It'll be put into your Hidden album, which is locked behind either Face ID or your password. You can find the Hidden album in the Collections tab, at the bottom under the Utilities section.

The iPhone is pretty secure out of the box, and Apple courts users into leveraging its security features as you set up a new device. Just like the privacy settings, however, the particular settings you use here are up to you. Many security settings will sacrifice privacy, and vice versa. You can't locate a stolen device if you aren't using location services, for example.

You need to set up Face ID when you set up an iPhone, and you're probably using it anyway. But I've seen some misconceptions about how Face ID (and biometric authentication more broadly) works. Your fingerprint for Touch ID and images for Face ID are not sent to Apple, and they're generally more secure than a password or simple PIN.

Instead, your fingerprint or face is used to generate an ID, which is encrypted and stored in Apple's Secure Enclave, locally on your device. When you unlock your device, Face ID or Touch ID is checked against this ID, and if there's a match, your device unlocks. If you've been avoiding Face ID due to privacy concerns, you aren't protecting yourself as much as you might think.

You and I both know it—you should be using two-factor authentication (2FA). I hate typing in a code or pulling up a second device as much as the next person, but it's hard to overstate just how much more secure an account is with two authentication factors instead of one. And, you can easily set up 2FA for your Apple account from your iPhone.

Select your name at the top of the Settings app, which will open your Apple account information. Select Sign-In & Security, and then choose Two-Factor Authentication. Here, you'll see devices you can use for 2FA, including the iPhone you're using. When signing into your Apple account on another device, you can use any of the devices listed as your second factor, be it another Apple product or a text sent to a verified phone number.

iCloud encrypts your data, but it doesn't use end-to-end encryption, at least by default. Out of the box, Apple manages your encryption keys, so it could, technically, decrypt the data you store in iCloud. Although that's unlikely, you can still set up end-to-end encryption and manage your own encryption keys with Advanced Data Protection.

To turn it on, open Settings and select iCloud. Then, scroll down and select Advanced Data Protection. To turn it on, you'll need to set up some account recovery options. Apple won't be able to decrypt your data, so if you don't have any recovery options set up, you won't be able to decrypt or recover your data.

Apple includes Stolen Device Protection with your iPhone, but it's turned off by default. This feature requires you to verify with Face ID or Touch ID when taking certain actions without a password to fall back on, and it enforces a security delay, where critical actions such as changing your Apple password are only possible after a one-hour delay.

There are two forms of Stolen Device Protection. You can either have these features on all the time, or only when you're away from familiar locations. Note that if you choose the latter, you'll need to keep the Significant Locations & Routes setting mentioned earlier turned on.

If you set up Stolen Device Protection to only work when you're away from familiar locations, it'll kick in automatically. However, Stolen Device Protection doesn't lock down everything about your iPhone. It crops up in certain situations, which Apple details on its support page. You can turn on the setting in the Privacy & Security menu at the bottom of the page.

You often have to trade privacy for better security, and that's the case for both Stolen Device Protection and Apple's “Find My” feature. To make sure you have it on, open Settings, select your account at the top, and choose Find My. Make sure Find My iPhone is turned on. If you tap in, you can also turn on Send Last Location, which will update the location of your iPhone if it's about to die.

Although you'll need to have location services running, Apple says that devices using iOS 17 and later don't need to share that location data. When offline, at least, Apple can't see location information when you have Find My turned on.

Finally, a bit of operational security. If you have sensitive information that could pop up in notifications, you can obfuscate how notifications appear while your iPhone is locked. It's a small change, but it can keep you protected from someone peaking over your shoulder or picking up your phone while it's locked.

Open Settings and head to Notifications. There, switch the display to Count and change Show Previews to either When Unlocked or Never. If you have a particularly sensitive app—say, an encrypted messaging app—you can also customize individual app notifications on this screen.

The iPhone provides a surprising number of privacy and security tools, from app privacy reports to a built-in password manager via the Passwords app. Some functions are better served with a third-party app, though, either for better security or more features. Although all of the apps I'm recommending here have paid options—and I recommend those paid plans—they all also have a free version if you don't have the money to spare.

Proton

Proton VPN (2 Year)

Proton VPN (Yearly)

ProtonVPN is the best VPN you can use, and you can get started with it for free. While most free VPNs are questionable at best, Proton's free service is rock solid. You're limited to slower speeds and only have access to a handful of servers, but it still works. I'd be worried if a free VPN didn't impose any limitations, frankly. It's also one of the best VPNs for iPhone, mainly due to its excellent speed. Proton tops the charts in our speed tests, and although others, such as NordVPN, are close, Proton has maintained its lead across desktop and mobile.

The iPhone has a VPN built in, but it's not the same thing as commercial VPNs as most people know them. Rather, it's a configuration tool if you want to set up your own VPN. If you want a tool to mask your IP address and help you stay more private online, you'll need a third-party VPN, and Proton VPN is the best.

Bitwarden

Bitwarden (Free)

Bitwarden ranks as the best password manager you can use, though Proton Pass takes a close second. Both offer free options, and they'll give you more flexibility when storing and sharing credentials compared to Apple's built-in Passwords app.

Although Apple's Passwords app is plenty secure, it's limited. An app like 1Password has apps for Windows and Android, for instance, which Passwords lacks. Third-party password managers let you store a wide range of data, too, from passwords and passkeys to encrypted documents and medical insurance.

Proton (Free)

Proton (Mail Plus, Monthly)

Proton (Unlimited, Monthly)

You've locked down your messages; now it's time for email. Google recently started offering end-to-end encryption for Gmail, but only for Google Workspace customers. If you want end-to-end encryption for personal use, you'll need an encrypted email service like Proton Mail, which is my favorite option.

There's a lot to like about Proton Mail, but from a security standpoint, it does a couple of things right. First, if you're sending emails to another Proton Mail user, you get the convenience of a service like Gmail, but with true end-to-end encryption. Your emails are encrypted before they leave your device, and they're only decrypted once they're delivered.

You can also send emails to non-Proton users with end-to-end encryption, either using Proton's password-protected email feature or by sharing your public key, though that requires a bit of technical know-how on both parties.

A corporate turnaround is the most difficult maneuver in business: invest heavily in the future while being judged quarter by quarter. Intel is now deep in that crucible, and for the first time in years, the pain is starting to look like progress.

For Intel, this challenge now falls to its new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, who has taken the helm to execute the ambitious IDM 2.0 strategy architected by his predecessor, Pat Gelsinger. Tan, a legendary technologist and one of Silicon Valley's most respected investors, faces the daily reality of this paradox.

Intel's recent Q3 2025 financial report is a perfect snapshot of this challenging story of short-term pain that, for the first time in a long time, clearly illuminates a path to long-term victory. The headline numbers were solid. Intel beat expectations on revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share. But frankly, that's not the real story.

The real story is that this is the fourth consecutive quarter of improved execution, proving the strategy isn't just a set of slides; it's a plan in motion under new, steady leadership. More importantly, the report shows why this turnaround is so difficult and why it's on the right track.

The “bad news” in the report, like a guided-down gross margin for Q4, isn't a sign of failure. It is the necessary, painful, and deeply positive cost of investment.

Let's talk about Intel this week, and we'll close with my Product of the Week: the Wonderfitter M9 Smart VR pistol.

In a turnaround, boring is beautiful. When Pat Gelsinger began this turnaround, Intel was a company that had lost its credibility. It had a long, painful history of missing deadlines, fumbling new process nodes, and losing its manufacturing crown to TSMC. Before Intel could ask the world to believe in its multi-decade foundry ambitions, it first had to prove it could simply do what it said it would do, quarter after quarter.

The Q3 report, under Lip-Bu Tan's leadership, shows that the turnaround is maintaining its critical momentum. Beating guidance on revenue, margin, and EPS for the fourth consecutive time is the most important signal Intel can send. It tells customers, partners, and investors that the operational chaos is over and the ship, under its new captain, remains steady.

Execution in the core business — selling client (CCG) and data center (DCAI) chips — is the engine that funds the entire revolution. It provides the cash flow to build the massive, multi-billion-dollar fabs that are the heart of the new strategy. Without this disciplined execution, the entire long-term plan is just a fantasy.

The most powerful validation of Intel's strategy isn't coming from its own press releases; it's coming from the wallets of its government, its partners, and even its chief rivals. Tan's deep history as a venture capitalist and industry connector becomes a massive asset here. The Q3 report was bolstered by a series of massive external investments that fundamentally de-risk the entire turnaround.

First, there is the vital support from the U.S. government. The CHIPS and Science Act funding Intel is receiving isn't a handout; it's a cornerstone of national security. The U.S. has recognized the profound strategic risk posed by having 90% of the world's most advanced chips manufactured in a single location — Taiwan.

Intel is the only U.S.-based company with the R&D and manufacturing scale to break that dependency. The government's support effectively makes Intel a strategic national asset, insulating its long-term plan from short-term market turbulence.

Second, and perhaps more stunning, is the support from its competitors. Nvidia, the company that has dominated the AI boom, is now a key partner. Nvidia's recent investment in Intel, alongside others like SoftBank, is a massive vote of confidence.

However, the real story is the strategic collaboration. Nvidia is partnering with Intel to create a new class of x86 products for the AI era, and more importantly, it has signaled a strong interest in using Intel Foundry Services (IFS). Why? Because Nvidia needs a viable alternative to TSMC. The Nvidia-Intel collaboration is the ultimate validation of Intel's foundry roadmap.

Finally, Intel has smartly monetized its non-core assets by spinning out Altera (its programmable chip division) and Mobileye (its autonomous driving unit) into separate, publicly traded companies. These moves are a smart financing hallmark of Tan's strategic playbook.

By selling a majority stake in these entities, Intel raised billions in cash to fund the core fab build-out without taking on suffocating new debt, all while retaining valuable partnerships and ownership shares.

The AI revolution is driving an insatiable, accelerating demand for computing power. Intel's Q3 report shows it's finally positioning itself to capture this wave from every possible angle. It's no longer just about its core x86 platforms. The opportunity now extends to purpose-built ASICs, accelerators like the Gaudi 3, and, most importantly, its foundry services.

Every company racing to build a custom AI chip — be it Microsoft, Google, Amazon, or a new startup — needs someone to manufacture it. Intel is building the factory for the AI gold rush. This is where the foundry strategy comes into full focus. The report's update on its process roadmap is the most important metric for the company's future.

The news that Intel's ambitious 18A process node is advancing as planned is critical because this technology will put Intel back in the lead over TSMC. The fact that Fab 52 in Arizona, where 18A will be manufactured, is now fully operational and on track to bring Panther Lake chips to market this year is the proof of execution investors have been waiting for.

Furthermore, the encouraging early feedback on the next generation, 14A, shows that this isn't a one-hit wonder. Intel is building a sustainable, long-term pipeline.

Intel's Q4 guidance illustrates the investing-in-a-turnaround paradox most clearly. The company guided its Gross Margin (GM) down sequentially, a fact that would normally send investors fleeing. But why is Intel guiding down?

1. Strategic Prioritization: The guide shows Data Center (DCAI) revenue up, but Client (CCG) revenue down. This is a deliberate choice. Intel is prioritizing its limited wafer capacity for high-value, high-profit server chips over low-value, entry-level client parts. This is smart, profitable business.

2. Ramping New Products: The guidance cites the “first shipments of Core Ultra 3.” Ramping a brand-new product on a new process is always expensive. Initial manufacturing yields are lower, and startup costs are high. A temporary margin hit from a new product ramp is not a sign of weakness; it is a sign of progress.

3. Accounting Changes: The “Altera deconsolidation” (selling a majority stake) means Intel can no longer count Altera's high-margin revenue on its main balance sheet. This is a simple accounting change, not an operational failure.

The Q4 guidance makes the cost of the turnaround visible. Intel is strategically prioritizing its most profitable products and eating the upfront costs of launching its next generation of chips — precisely what a company in a deep investment cycle is supposed to do.

Intel's Q3 2025 report is one of the most significant and positive in years, precisely because it's not all rosy. It shows a company executing with discipline under its new leadership, providing the financial stability to fund its own rebirth. It shows the smartest money in the world — from the U.S. government to its chief rival, Nvidia — is now betting on Intel's success.

The strategy laid out by Pat Gelsinger was bold. However, strategy is nothing without execution and financial discipline. Lip-Bu Tan is arguably the perfect leader for this phase of the plan: a seasoned operator and one of the most respected investors in the industry. He is bringing a new level of financial and partnership-focused discipline to the fight.

Intel's Q3 2025 report demonstrates that the company is finally making the hard choices, and for the first time in a decade, it looks like those choices are the right ones.



Virtual reality has a “feel” problem. We can put on a headset and see astonishing, photorealistic worlds, but the moment we look down at our hands, the illusion shatters. We're holding two floating, lightweight plastic controllers that look and feel like video game toys.

The tactile disconnect is the last great barrier to true immersion. The new Wonderfitter M9 Smart VR Pistol — currently on sale for $229 — doesn't just chip away at this barrier; it shatters it with the cold, hard feel of machined metal. It's a stunning piece of hardware that shows us the real future of VR, even if its software is still racing to catch up.

The first time you pick up the M9, you get it. This isn't a hollow plastic shell that a standard Meta Quest controller snaps into. It's a 1:1-scale, CNC-machined aluminum replica of the legendary Beretta M9. It has the full weight, heft, and cold-to-the-touch feel of the real firearm.

The “wow factor” isn't just visual; it's visceral. The trigger has a clean, mechanical break. The slide reciprocates with a satisfying thwack. The magazine release drops a weighted mag into your palm. This tactile feedback is what VR has been missing. Firing a weapon in-game is no longer a simple button-press; it's a physical, engaging action that connects your body to the virtual world.

The commitment to realism is what makes accessories like the Wonderfitter M9 Smart VR pistol so crucial to the future of VR gaming. When your virtual self performs an action that your physical body does not, your brain flags it as fake. But when you have to physically rack a slide, drop a magazine, and manage the weight of the object in your hand, the experience becomes exponentially more engaging.

This is why high-end flight simulators have dedicated yokes and racing sims have force-feedback wheels. The success of VR, especially in the shooter and simulation genres, will be directly tied to closing this “immersion gap.” The Wonderfitter M9 is a massive leap in the right direction.

However, the M9's primary shortfall is that the hardware is writing a check that the current software ecosystem can't quite cash. Because it's a third-party accessory that “borrows” the tracking puck from a standard controller, the integration isn't always seamless.

Out of the box, it may be supported only by a handful of dedicated simulation titles, such as Onward or Pavlov VR. For many other games, getting it to work requires diving into complex settings menus or using third-party configuration tools, which can be a massive headache for the average user.

This software problem is solvable and, almost certainly, temporary. As high-fidelity accessories become more popular, game developers will be incentivized to add native support for them. We will see driver-level improvements and simpler setup wizards.

The hardware, on the other hand, is the real breakthrough. The Wonderfitter M9 is a pro-level tool for the serious VR enthusiast who wants to move beyond “playing a game” and into “running a simulation.” It's an easy pick for me to showcase because it's not just a great accessory; it's a tangible glimpse of a future where the virtual world has real, undeniable weight.

The Wonderfitter M9 Smart VR Pistol is now one of the coolest virtual reality accessories I own — and my Product of the Week.

Seattle venture firm Founders' Co-op unveiled its sixth fund — $50 million, matching the size of its previous fund — to back another batch of early-stage tech startups.

Chris DeVore, founding managing partner at Founders' Co-op, said about 80–90% of investments will go to Pacific Northwest founders, typically at the pre-product or pre-revenue stage.

Founded in 2008, Founders' Co-op was an early backer of billion-dollar companies such as Remitly, Outreach, and Auth0.

The firm is sticking to its core strategy of backing ambitious technical founding teams in its backyard and helping them build companies that go on to raise capital elsewhere.

“Our strategy has always been to be the best first-check investor in our chosen market, not to grow our AUM and wind up competing with the money-center investors our founders need for the next leg of the journey,” DeVore wrote in a blog post.

He added, in reference to the fund size: “It's not bigger, because as they say in venture, ‘your fund size is your strategy.'”

GeekWire previously reported on the fund earlier this year. 

The new fund will go to about 30 companies. Average initial checks will range from $1 million to $1.5 million. The firm aims for 10% ownership at the first investment. It does not invest in specific verticals, instead placing more weight on entrepreneurs.

“We're lucky to be alive in the greatest era of compounding technological advancement in human history,” DeVore wrote in the post. “And we expect that acceleration to continue. But no moment in the hype cycle — up to and including the current LLM wave — matters more than the people we back and the problems they choose to solve.”

Founders' Co-op is now based inside Foundations, the new hub for Seattle-area entrepreneurs founded last year by Aviel Ginzburg, general partner at Founders' Co-op. It has quickly become a magnet for the city's startup community — and an advantage for Founders' Co-op.

“Foundations is Aviel's love-letter to the local founder community — so it's not a fund project — but by making Seattle a better place to be a founder, and helping the strongest and most committed founders connect and share with each other, it has absolutely put compelling new investment opportunities in our path,” DeVore told GeekWire. 

Asked this morning if the firm is still bullish on Seattle, DeVore said: “like you wouldn't believe.”

Some of the firm's more recent investments include land use data startup Aarden AI, business automation AI company Logic, and internal help desk startup Ravenna.

DeVore said one team “particularly worth watching at the moment” is RowZero, a Seattle startup that sells spreadsheet software and raised $10 million in a seed round earlier this year.

Most limited partners in the new fund are returning investors, with a few new backers from outside the region who “believe in small funds and the PNW as a differentiated and underserved market,” DeVore said.

Founders' Co-op raised $50 million for its fifth fund in 2021 and $25 million for its fourth fund in 2018.

DeVore previously led the Techstars Seattle accelerator but stepped down in 2019 to focus on Founders' Co-op full time. Ginzburg, a Simply Measured co-founder who joined the firm in 2015 and became general partner in 2018, was managing director of Amazon's Alexa Accelerator from 2017 to 2020.

Ginzburg launched Foundations in the aftermath of the surprising closure of Techstars Seattle last year.

Other Seattle-area firms raising new funds include Ascend, Flying Fish, and Graham & Walker. Longtime firm Madrona raised $770 million for its new funds earlier this year.

Microsoft announced additional investments in the United Arab Emirates as it looks to expand its data center footprint and capitalize on export licenses. 

The Redmond, Wash.-based tech giant has already spent $7.3 billion since 2023, including a $1.5 billion equity stake in Abu Dhabi–based G42, the country's sovereign AI company. Microsoft said Monday it plans to invest another $7.9 billion from 2026 to 2029.

The funding covers AI and cloud infrastructure, workforce training, and new governance initiatives.

“This is not money raised in the UAE. It's money we're spending in the UAE,” Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post. “And as we do everywhere in the world, we're focused not just on growing our business but also on contributing to the local economy. This involves bringing together three critical factors — technology, talent, and trust.”

Microsoft said it was the first U.S. corporation to get approval from the Trump administration to receive export licenses from the Commerce Department to ship Nvidia GPUs to the UAE. “We're using these GPUs to provide access to advanced AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source providers, and Microsoft itself,” Smith wrote.

Microsoft says the effort is guided by “technology, talent, and trust,” anchored by a new Responsible AI Future Foundation and a first-of-its-kind intergovernmental assurance framework designed to align its UAE operations with U.S. cybersecurity and data protection standards.

Microsoft has nearly 1,000 full-time employees in the UAE.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

ChatGPT maker OpenAI, exercising newfound freedom under its renegotiated Microsoft partnership, will expand its cloud footprint for training and running AI models to Amazon's infrastructure under a new seven-year, $38 billion agreement.

The deal, announced Monday, positions Amazon as a major infrastructure provider for Microsoft's flagship AI partner, highlighting seemingly insatiable demand for computing power and increasingly complex alliances among big companies seeking to capitalize on AI.

It comes as Microsoft, Amazon, and big tech companies attempt to reassure investors who've grown concerned about a possible bubble in AI spending and infrastructure investment.

Under its new Amazon deal, OpenAI is slated to begin running AI workloads on Amazon Web Services' new EC2 UltraServers, which use hundreds of thousands of Nvidia GPUs. Amazon says the infrastructure will help to run ChatGPT and train future OpenAI models.

Amazon shares rose nearly 5% in early trading after the announcement.

“Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in the press release announcing the deal. “Our partnership with AWS strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.”

Matt Garman, the AWS CEO, said in the release that Amazon's cloud infrastructure will serve as “a backbone” for OpenAI's ambitions.

In an interview with CNBC, Dave Brown, Amazon's vice president of compute and machine learning services, said the new agreement represents “completely separate capacity” that AWS is building out for OpenAI. “Some of that capacity is already available, and OpenAI is making use of that,” Brown told CNBC.

Amazon has also been deepening its investment in AI infrastructure for Anthropic, the rival startup behind the Claude chatbot. Amazon has invested and committed a total of $8 billion in Anthropic and recently opened Project Rainier, an $11 billion data center complex for Anthropic's workloads, running on hundreds of thousands of its custom Trainium 2 chips.

Microsoft has been expanding its own relationship with Anthropic, adding the startup's Claude models to Microsoft 365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot, and its Azure AI Foundry platform

Up to this point, OpenAI has relied almost exclusively on Microsoft Azure for the computing infrastructure behind its large language models. The new deal announced by Microsoft and OpenAI last week revised that relationship, giving OpenAI more flexibility to use other cloud providers — removing Microsoft's right of first refusal on new OpenAI workloads. 

At the same time, OpenAI committed to purchase an additional $250 billion in Microsoft services. Microsoft still holds specific IP rights to OpenAI's models and products through 2032, including the exclusive ability among major cloud platforms to offer OpenAI's technology through its Azure OpenAI Service.

OpenAI's new $38 billion deal with Amazon builds on a relationship that began earlier this year, when Amazon added OpenAI's first open-weight models in five years to its Bedrock and SageMaker services. Released under an open-source license, those models weren't bound by OpenAI's exclusive API agreement with Microsoft, letting Amazon offer them on its platforms.

The latest announcement is part of a series of deals by OpenAI in recent months with companies including Oracle and Google — committing hundreds of billions of dollars overall for AI computing capacity, and raising questions about the long-term economics of the AI boom.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

The new Seattle startup, led by longtime entrepreneur Nikesh Parekh, wants companies to scrap the traditional resume and replace it with portfolios of real work and challenge-based assessments.

Provn's software facilitates “AI challenges” — for example, building an AI agent or solving a business problem. It also records candidate video walkthroughs and uses analytics to measure performance. Companies get data-driven insights and candidates build profiles they can reuse across employers.

Parekh described it as a skills-first marketplace for AI talent, timed to a shift where “every job is becoming an AI role.”

Parekh told GeekWire the idea taps into several converging trends: “the buzz around AI replacing people, changing nature of work, and AI jobs being the only growth area.”

He said traditional job platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed have massive scale but are less effective at helping companies find high quality candidates, especially with more “AI slop” to wade through.

Provn also aims to go beyond technical-testing tools such as HackerRank and Codility, which Parekh described as narrow.

The company is targeting two main customer groups:

Provn is partnering with startup communities and companies including Read AI, Yoodli, and other Seattle-area employers to launch its minimum viable product. It's also working with recruiting firms.

The startup is self-funded so far, plans to raise a seed round, and isn't generating revenue yet. Its business model will charge employers per hire and offer premium tools for candidates — such as an “AI agent” that helps them market themselves and find new opportunities.

Parekh is a familiar name in the Seattle tech startup scene. He co-founded Suplari, an AI-driven spend intelligence firm acquired by Microsoft in 2021, and then spent four years working on Copilot Studio and Power Platform. His career also includes leadership roles at real estate tech firms (Market Leader, Trulia) and early stage ventures.

Parekh's former colleagues are part of the team at Provn, including:

Provn joins other recruiting tech startups in the Seattle area that includes hiring platform Humanly, technical interviewing company Karat, and staffing startup ConverzAI.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

OpenAI isn't done securing the AI infrastructure it needs to rapidly scale agentic workloads. The ChatGPT-maker on Monday said it has reached a deal with Amazon to buy $38 billion in cloud computing services over the next seven years.  

OpenAI said it will immediately start using AWS compute, with all capacity targeted to be deployed before the end of 2026, with the ability to expand further into 2027 and beyond.  

The deal follows OpenAI's restructuring last week, which freed the company from having to secure Microsoft's approval to buy computing services from other firms.

OpenAI's deal with Amazon is part of its larger mission to grow computing power, spending more than $1 trillion over the next decade. The company has announced new data center buildouts with Oracle, SoftBank, the United Arab Emirates, and others. OpenAI has also secured deals with chipmakers Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom.

To some analysts, the increased investment form OpenAI and other tech giants signals that the industry is heading towards an AI bubble, wherein massive sums are spent beefing out an unproven, and potentially dangerous, technology with no clear sign of a meaningful return on investment.

Since AI tools went mainstream, filmmakers, writers, and actors have been scrambling to figure out whether these technologies can truly assist their creativity or if they might end up replacing humans. But there's a larger concern to address before we get swept away by debate: AI can't run without enormous data centers and energy infrastructure.

A new joint venture, dubbed Utopai East, aims to address that need by developing infrastructure specifically for producing movies and TV shows using AI. The joint venture is held 50-50 by investment firm Stock Farm Road (SFR) and AI film and television production company Utopai Studios. 

SFR, co-founded by Brian Koo (the grandson of LG Group's founder Koo In-hwoi) and Amin Badr-El-Din, the founder and chief executive of BADR Investments, is contributing capital to the joint venture, along with creative expertise and industry contacts. Utopai, meanwhile, is providing the technology, workflow and infrastructure.

The project will also involve co-producing film and television projects, and expanding access to Korean intellectual property for international audiences. Production will begin using existing infrastructure, and the company expects the first piece of content from this collaboration to be released next year, according to Cecilia Shen, co-founder and CEO of Utopai Studios.

In the short term, using AI is going to be primarily about lowering costs and increasing efficiency, Koo told TechCrunch.

“But beyond that, we're very excited about the new possibilities AI opens up. As we engage with creators, we're exploring what entirely new things can become possible. Right now, some of our early focus is on creators in Korea,” Koo said. “Just as short-form content was a novelty when it first emerged, we see opportunities for fresh approaches. We're working not only with established directors in cinema but also with young, innovative creators who aren't limited to traditional movies.”  

But novelty alone won't allay the concerns of the people working in the entertainment industry, or the ones consuming the content. AI could one day replace people in creative roles like acting, performance, and writing, yet it often lacks the depth, nuance and emotional resonance of human storytelling. This has sparked a broader debate about the value of human creativity in an era when machines can mimic, but not fully replicate, the human touch.

But Shen and Koo maintain that their use of AI is only aimed at improving existing processes. “These questions have been at the center of everything we build at Utopai Studios,” Shen said. “From the beginning, our focus was never on automation. Our workflow is designed to work alongside filmmakers, not in place of them. We still need writers to write, directors to direct, and actors to perform,” Shen said.

Every model and every dataset used is fully licensed and contractually approved, ensuring the technology respects the creators whose work makes filmmaking possible, Shen added.

“We want creators to understand that AI can expand their creative potential rather than compete with them. It can help bring their dreams to life, giving them the freedom to fully explore their creativity without worrying that AI will replace them. This, we believe, is going to be one of the most exciting outcomes for us,” Koo said.

“Typically, content and IP grow incrementally — one IP develops after another — but with the right technology, especially AI, there's potential for exponential growth. This isn't about AI replacing people; it's about the massive value it can create for audiences, creators, and engineers alike,” he added.

The deal follows SFR's recent agreement with the Jeollanam-do Province government to build a 3-gigawatt AI data center in South Korea.

“The data center is part of our larger mission at Stock Farm Road to build the backbone for the next generation of intelligence-driven industries. Beyond Utopai Studios and entertainment, we are also focused on areas such as manufacturing, energy-to-information, AI, and quantum computing. These are all interconnected fields that require the same kind of infrastructure,” said Koo.

The data center will serve as the foundation for everything Utopai East is developing, and will include complete AI infrastructure for entertainment content, spanning data management, creative intelligence, production and distribution.

While the joint venture's financial details were not disclosed, the capital is coming from multiple channels, including SFR's investment vehicles, global sovereign and institutional investors, and industry partners in film and entertainment, the company said.

The JV will start off making Korean content, but aims to expand to other parts of Asia eventually. “Japan is always also a great market,” making it a natural starting point for expansion, Shen noted, adding that she also sees significant potential in China and Thailand.

TikTok announced on Monday that it's launching its first-ever TikTok Awards show in the U.S. The awards will include “Creator of the Year,” “Video of the Year,” “Muse of the Year,” “Breakthrough Artist of the Year,” and more.

The announcement comes just weeks after Instagram introduced its “Ring” awards program. Unlike Instagram, however, TikTok is taking a more traditional approach to its awards, as it's hosting an actual awards show where winners will be revealed live at the event. The event will feature a red carpet, live performances, and a live audience of hundreds of creators, TikTok says.

The awards show will take place on December 18 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles and will be livestreamed on the TikTok app and on Tubi. The show will be available to stream on demand on Tubi the following day.

Users will be able to vote for their favorite creators on a new portal on TikTok launching on November 18. 

It's worth noting that although this is TikTok's first awards show in the U.S., it has held similar events in other countries, including Germany, Mexico, Korea, and more in the past.

The nominees for “Creator of the Year” are adamw, alixearle. brookemonk_, keith_lee125, and kristy.sarah. The nominees for “Breakthrough Artist of the Year” are alexwarren, katseyeworld, laufey, ravynlenae, and sombr.

Other awards categories include “Storyteller of the Year,” TikTok for Good Award,” “MVP of the Year,” “Okay Slay Award,” “TikTok LIVE Creators of the Year,” and more. 

The full list of awards and nominees can be found on TikTok's announcement post.

By launching an awards show, TikTok is positioning itself as more than just a social media app and more of a notable force in the entertainment industry. Given that TikTok serves as a launching pad for several emerging artists and actors, it makes sense for the company to celebrate its top users with its own branded show.

“The trophies presented on stage will beam a colorful glow upon the creators defining this new era of culture encompassing many areas, including fashion, beauty, sports, TV and film, and new forms of entertainment,” TikTok wrote in the announcement post.

Microsoft will invest $15.2 billion in the United Arab Emirates over the next four years, the company announced Monday at the first annual Abu Dhabi Global AI Summit. The investment will include the first-ever shipments of the most advanced Nvidia GPUs to the UAE.

As part of the deal, the U.S. has granted Microsoft a license to export Nvidia chips to the UAE, a move that positions the country as both a proving ground for U.S. export-control diplomacy and a regional anchor of American AI influence. 

The deal allows Microsoft to expand its foothold into the Middle East, a key region in the global fight for AI dominance. In May, President Donald Trump struck a deal with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan to build an AI data center campus in Abu Dhabi. The project was delayed due to U.S. export controls, which restricted the sale of powerful Nvidia chips needed to run advanced AI systems.

Microsoft became the first company to receive a license from the U.S. Commerce Department to ship the chips to the UAE in September. The move comes as critics say the deal undermines the logic of the U.S.'s export restrictions to China by introducing possible back-channels through a Chinese ally. 

In a statement, Microsoft said it performed substantial work to meet the strong cybersecurity and national security conditions required by the licenses, which has enabled the firm to accumulate the equivalent of 21,500 Nvidia A100 GPUs in the UAE, based on a combination of A100, H100, and H200 chips.  

Microsoft said it is using the chips to provide access to AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source providers, and itself. 

The $15.2 billion figure includes money Microsoft began spending in the UAE starting in 2023 as part of a new AI initiative in the country. Between 2023 and the end of 2025, Microsoft will have spent just over $7.3 billion in the UAE, including a $1.5 billion equity investment in G42, the UAE's sovereign AI company, and more than $4.6 billion in capital towards data centers. 

As part of the new deal, Microsoft pledges to spend $7.9 billion more in the UAE from the start of 2026 to the end of 2029, including $5.5 billion in capital expenses for ongoing and planned expansion of AI and cloud infrastructure. Microsoft hinted at new steps it will share publicly in Abu Dhabi this week.

Microsoft's work in the UAE goes beyond building data centers. The company says it is pairing massive AI infrastructure with deep investment in local talent, training, and governance. The firm is pledging to train a million residents by 2027 and use Abu Dhabi as a regional hub for AI research and model development.  

The investment comes the same day that Microsoft signed a $9.7 billion deal with Australia's IREN for AI cloud capacity.

Alphabet's X moonshot factory is shifting how it brings ambitious technology projects to market, increasingly spinning them out as independent companies rather than keeping them within the Alphabet corporate structure, X's head honcho, Astro Teller, revealed at TechCrunch Disrupt this past week.

The strategy hinges on a dedicated venture fund that exists solely to invest in X spinouts, and in which Alphabet is only a minority investor. “If Alphabet was the sole LP, the fund would be inside of Alphabet, and then when they invested in something from X, it would still be inside Alphabet,” Teller explained onstage. “So Alphabet can be a small LP, but if it's more than a small LP, we undo the thing that we're trying to accomplish.”

That fund is Series X Capital, which has raised over $500 million and is run by Gideon Yu, a former YouTube executive and Facebook CFO. Bloomberg first reported the fund's existence last year. Unlike Alphabet's other investment arms — GV, which invests broadly in early-stage startups; CapitalG, which backs growth-stage companies; and Gradient Ventures, which invests in AI startups — Series X Capital is legally obligated to invest exclusively in companies spinning out of X.

The approach represents a meaningful evolution for X, which has historically graduated successful projects like Waymo and Wing into standalone Alphabet subsidiaries. Teller said the lab has learned over the past decade that while some moonshots benefit from Alphabet's resources and scale, others “can go faster and won't really benefit from being part of Alphabet because they're just so different.”

“Landing it just outside the Alphabet membrane, where we can be very tight with them, get a lot of strategic co-benefit with them, but not necessarily control them, makes sense,” he said.At Disrupt, Teller explained that the spinout strategy only works because of X's approach to intellectual honesty, including a culture that actively celebrates killing off promising ideas.

X defines a moonshot as having three specific components: it must attempt to solve a huge problem in the world, propose some kind of product or service that could make that problem disappear, and leverage breakthrough tech that creates a “glimmer of hope” that the team inside X can solve that problem. Critically, Teller said, “if someone is proposing a moonshot and it sounds reasonable, the company isn't interested, because that, by definition, wouldn't be a moonshot.”

What happens to ideas that meet these criteria? X tests them ruthlessly, looking for reasons to kill them, Teller said. “If you propose something and it sounds pretty wild, that has those three components, and it's a testable hypothesis, for a small amount of money, we can learn something about whether it's a little bit more crazy than we thought, or a little bit less crazy than we thought,” Teller explained. “If it's a little bit more crazy than we thought, cool, high five, let's put a bullet in its head and move on.”

This approach requires detaching people from their ideas, which is why Teller said he doesn't even know who started most projects at X, including Waymo, the self-driving car company, and Wing, the drone delivery company now dropping off Walmart packages in roughly six U.S. cities. “If we're going to go exploring something, and you [as the lead inventor] feel like ‘this is my baby,' what are the chances I get you to practice real intellectual honesty?” he told the Disrupt audience.

In practice, this means X tackles the hardest parts of projects first, actively looking for reasons to shut them down. The result is a brutal 2% hit rate that Teller frames not as failure but as feature. In fact, X has killed off entire categories that once seemed promising, like copywriting AI tools that foundation models eventually absorbed.All that testing and failing can be expensive. The spinout structure solves a practical problem: while X previously had to find outside venture investors willing to take over at least 51% of a business to spin it out of Alphabet, by creating a fund that “deeply understands us,” said Teller, X can systematize the spinout process while maintaining close strategic ties.

Despite the emphasis on detachment from ideas, X employees do have significant skin in the game when projects spin out. “You and the rest of your team are going to get a chunk of that company,” Teller said. “It is about as much as you would have gotten if you had started from your garage at that stage of funding, but without taking any risk in the meantime.”

The pitch to potential X employees is explicit about this trade-off, too. “Your four or five standard deviation upside is going to be bigger on the outside, I'm granting you that,” Teller said at Disrupt. “But if you come to X, what you get to do is be a card counter of innovation with us, with no fear and no financial risk to yourself.”

X employees are paid like other Google employees, with no equity in early-stage projects, because “it isn't even a company; it's an idea we're trying to learn about,” Teller explained. This removes the financial pressure that prevents founders from killing their own ideas. “You can say, ‘Hey, this one's not pulling our average up, let's throw this one away,'” Teller explained. “And because you haven't bet your kids' college fund on that, that doesn't scare you.”

X has spun out at least two companies in 2025: Taara, which develops wireless optical communication technology, and Heritable Agriculture, a biotech company using machine learning to accelerate crop breeding. Previous spinouts that raised external funding include Malta (renewable energy storage), Dandelion (geothermal heating), and iyO (AI-powered earbuds).

On the eve of Disrupt, X announced its newest moonshot company: Anori, a “new AI platform to help real estate developers, the architecture and construction industries, and cities untangle the complexities of new building projects,” as it describes itself. Asked onstage about what makes this particular AI platform a “moonshot,” Teller pointed to the size of the problem — and opportunity.

“The built environment is about 25% of the world's solid waste, [and] about 25% of the world's [carbon dioxide] output. It's literally on the Maslow's hierarchy of needs — it's where we live, where we spend most of our time. It's a big chunk of the world's GDP output. So it would be hard for it to matter more as an industry.”

You can catch our entire conversation with Teller here, beginning at the 6:08 minute mark.

Microsoft is leaving no stone unturned in its quest to secure more compute capacity for meeting its customers' heavy demand for AI services.

On Monday, the Redmond-based tech giant signed a $9.7 billion, five-year contract with Australia's IREN to secure further AI cloud capacity. The deal will give Microsoft access to compute infrastructure built with Nvidia's GB300 GPUs, which will be deployed over phases through 2026 at IREN's facility in Childress, Texas, planned to support 750 megawatts of capacity.

IREN said it is separately buying GPUs and equipment from Dell for about $5.8 billion.

The deal comes after Microsoft last month launched its first production cluster with Nvidia's GB300 NVL72 systems for Azure, which, the company said, are optimized for reasoning models, agentic AI systems and multi-modal generative AI. 

Last month, Microsoft signed a deal with Nscale for approximately 200,000 Nvidia GB300 GPUs to three data centers in Europe and one in the U.S.

Similar to competitors like CoreWeave, IREN started off as a bitcoin-mining operation, but quickly realized that its massive collection of GPUs were better put to use for AI workloads. The company has benefited massively from the shift in focus. The company's CEO Daniel Roberts expects the Microsoft deal to take up only 10% of the company's total capacity and generate about $1.94 billion in annualized revenue, Bloomberg reported.

In my personal experience, screening software engineers has always put pressure on internal engineering teams. Over the years, I've tried different approaches to streamline the process, but nothing has really fixed the problem of investing engineering time into screening.At the start of the year I went through BetterStack's recruitment process. Their first stage, an in-house built async screening test, was a revelation for me. I thought this was a fantastic alternative for an early stage in the recruitment pipeline. Back in February, while I was actively hiring at the startup I was working with, I prototyped a solution and trialed it - it was a success.Fast forward a few months and I've now been able to turn the early prototype into a product. Meet Niju.Niju replaces the traditional screening call with a 20-minute, asynchronous, recorded coding session.A candidate gets a link, shares their screen, and ""thinks aloud"" while solving a practical coding challenge (no abstract algorithms).After 20 minutes, Niju analyses the entire session: the code, the audio, and the thought process. It gives the hiring manager a concise report, transcripts, code playback and the raw footage with the important parts annotated. This means that, on average, a Niju interview takes 5 minutes to review.* Cheating: Yes, a candidate can use Google. That's the point. I want to see how they solve a problem, not what they've memorised. The screen recording shows their whole process.* AI: The AI does not produce a ""pass/fail"" decision. It just summarises the data to help a human make a better, faster, and more consistent decision.* Stack: As a solo builder, I'm keeping it simple: SvelteKit, DrizzleORM, BullMQ, Postgres, Redis, Azure OpenAI.The goal is to help busy engineering teams reclaim their time.You can try the first interview for free.I'll be here for a while to answer questions and I'd be honored to get your feedback.Radu

This is a screening interview. It's at the top of the recruitment funnel. The alternative is seeing fewer candidates (because you can't have engineers do non-stop interviews) or just filtering heavily based on CVs. Neither option is good.

Which as yanyu says is a signal the company isn't ""willing to spend the effort, time, and money to provide a good recruiting process, [which is] a huge red flag for the kind of candidates you want and the kind of employee experience you provide"".Which circles around and creates even more incentive for good candidates not to participate.There's no doubt a market on both sides for hiring mediocre candidates. Approximately everyone has a job after all, not just the best people, but a tool like this is clearly optimizing for that not for excellence.[1] See the excellent description of why this is problematic as a candidate who values your own time here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45801853

And to be clear, I think hiring today is completely broken already. This kind of thing is just one more step in the direction of marginalizing people who are already struggling to find work. In an already broken hiring system, these approaches to ""save engineering time"" or ""drive a more efficient hiring process"" exacerbate the divide between those who have jobs and those who are desperate to get a fair shot, and that's what feels truly dehumanizing.

reply

There needs to be some cost or pain for the interviewers to signal that they actually care.So, to answer your question, if a company were to outsource their screening calls, it signals to me that they do not have the time to understand their candidates. They simply do not care, which means they don't care for their employees either.

The technical screening call typically happens after an initial screening chat with HR or the hiring manager. The tech screening interview comes in after that.

Let me just apply one example. A few years ago I was screening candidates over a 30-minute live coding interview covering pretty day to day stuff. That required a 30 minute investment from the applicant in what is a high-stress situation for many. I can't tell you how many times they seemed very stressed simply because they had to code in a live interview setting knowing someone is actively watching what they are doing.Now compare that to a 20-minute screening interview where most of that pressure is gone. You can do it whenever you want to.That is my rationale behind it, thinking both as an applicant and as a hiring manager.Why do you think this leads to more wasted time?

reply

Also, your 20 vs 30 minute calculation ignores that companies are incentivized to conduct more screening tests if it becomes practically free for them. But the number of positions stays the same. So if instead of 10 screening calls they do 16 tests for one position, that's already more time being wasted, even if the tests are 1/3 shorter. And realistically, the number will shoot up much more.

reply

For your last point, a review takes on average 5 minutes for a hiring manager. And I think screening more is not inherently a problem. Imagine they turned down the dial on their CV filters and had more applicants do a technical screen - wouldn't that give more applicants an opportunity to shine? In most cases it unfortunately is a numbers game.

reply

They'll keep running screenings after they've got someone they're almost sure they are going to hire, because if the deal falls through its better to have candidates in the pipeline.They'll run screenings before they bother to evaluate if they're even interested in a candidates skill set, because you've made it cheaper to filter out candidates for lack of technical skills than lack of job fit. (And no forcing them to meet the candidate once before running this tool will not change the fact that they will do this)And so on and so forth. Which is ironically why using this tool would filter the best candidates from the hiring pipeline while simultaneously making life worse for everyone who isn't one of the best candidates and who does have to put up with many companies wasting their time to get a single job offer.

What I mean by that is that I think there is a good chance that LLMs are similar to a subsystem of human thinking. They are great at pattern recognition and prediction, which is a huge part of cognition. What they are not is conscious, or possessed of subjective experience in any measurable way.LLMs are like the part of your brain that sees something and maps it into a concept for you. I recently watched a video on the creation of AlexNet [0], one of the first wildly successful image-processing models. One of the impressive things about it is how it moves up the hierarchy from very basic patterns in images to more abstract ones (e. g. these two images' pixels might not be at all the same, but they both eventually map to a pattern for 'elephant').It's perfectly reasonable to imagine that our brains do something similar. You see a cat, in some context, and your brain maps it to the concept of 'cat', so you know, 'that's a cat'. What's missing is a) self-motivated, goal-directed action based on that knowledge, and b) a broader context for the world where these concepts not only map to each other, but feed into a sense of self and world and its distinctions whereby one can say: ""I am here, and looking at a cat.""It's possible those latter two parts can be solved, or approximated, by an LLM, but I am skeptical. I think LLMs represent a huge leap in technology which is simultaneously cooler than anyone would have imagined a decade ago, and less impressive than pretty much everyone wants you to believe when it comes to how much money we should pour into the companies that make them.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZDiGooFs54

I'm surprised it doesn't mention Leibniz's famous ""Let us calculate"" quote:>>In a 1679 letter to one of his patrons, Johann Friedrich, he described his project of the universal language as “the great instrument of reason, which will carry the forces of the mind further than the microscope has carried those of sight”. Later he wrote:>>>The only way to rectify our reasonings is to make them as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate, without further ado, to see who is right.[1]I'm also kind of surprised that Hooke wrote the letter in English, since I assumed all academic communication across language barriers back then would have been in Latin.

But fundamentally the reason ChatGPT became so popular as opposed to its incumbents like Google or Wikipedia, is that it dispensed with the idea of attributing quotes to sources. Even if 90% of the things it says can be attributed, it's by design that it can say novel stuff.The other side of the coin is that for things that are not novel, it attributes the quote to itself rather than sharing the credit with sources, which is what made the thing so popular in the first place, as if it were some kind of magic trick.These are obviously not fixable, but part of the design. I have the theory that the liabilities will be equivalent if not greater to the revenue recouped by OpenAI, but the liabilities will just take a lot longer to realize, considering not only the length of trials, but the length of case law and even new legislation to be created.In 10 years, Sama will be fighting to make the thing an NFP again and have the government bail it out of all the lawsuits that it will accrue.Maybe you can't just do things

On the other hand, training a small model to hallucinate less would be a significant development. Perhaps with post-training fine-tuning, after getting a sense of what depth of factual knowledge the model has actually absorbed, adding a chunk of training samples with a question that goes beyond the model's fact knowledge limitations, and the model responding ""Sorry, I'm a small language model and that question is out of my depth.""

Finetune it on the answer toolCall(""search"", ""that question"", ...) or whatever.Something close to the above is how all models with search tool capability are fine tuned.All these hallucinations are despite those efforts, it was much worse before.This whole method depends on the assumption that there is actually a path in the internal representation that fires when it's gonna hallucinate. The results so far tell us that it is partially true. No way to quantify it of course.

You need to gate away useful technology from the normies, usually. E.g. kickstarter used to have a problem where normies would think they were pre-ordering a finished product and so they had to pivot to being primarily a pre-order site.Anything that is actually experimental and has less than very high performance needs to be gated away from the normies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","This startup wants to clean up the copper industry","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/11/03/1127474/copper-smelting-chemistry-clean/","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Still Bright hopes its chemical process could help replace polluting copper smelters.

Demand for copper is surging, as is pollution from its dirty production processes. The founders of one startup, Still Bright, think they have a better, cleaner way to generate the copper the world needs. 

The company uses water-based reactions, based on battery chemistry technology, to purify copper in a process that could be less polluting than traditional smelting. The hope is that this alternative will also help ease growing strain on the copper supply chain.

“We're really focused on addressing the copper supply crisis that's looming ahead of us,” says Randy Allen, Still Bright's cofounder and CEO.

Copper is a crucial ingredient in everything from electrical wiring to cookware today. And clean energy technologies like solar panels and electric vehicles are introducing even more demand for the metal. Global copper demand is expected to grow by 40% between now and 2040. 

As demand swells, so do the climate and environmental impacts of copper extraction, the process of refining ore into a pure metal. There's also growing concern about the geographic concentration of the copper supply chain. Copper is mined all over the world, and historically, many of those mines had smelters on-site to process what they extracted. (Smelters form pure copper metal by essentially burning concentrated copper ore at high temperatures.) But today, the smelting industry has consolidated, with many mines shipping copper concentrates to smelters in Asia, particularly China.

That's partly because smelting uses a lot of energy and chemicals, and it can produce sulfur-containing emissions that can harm air quality. “They shipped the environmental and social problems elsewhere,” says Simon Jowitt, a professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, and director of the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology.

It's possible to scrub pollution out of a smelter's emissions, and smelters are much cleaner than they used to be, Jowitt says. But overall, smelting centers aren't exactly known for environmental responsibility. 

So even countries like the US, which have plenty of copper reserves and operational mines, largely ship copper concentrates, which contain up to around 30% copper, to China or other countries for smelting. (There are just two operational ore smelters in the US today.)

Still Bright avoids the pyrometallurgic process that smelters use in favor of a chemical approach, partially inspired by devices called vanadium flow batteries.

In the startup's reactor, vanadium reacts with the copper compounds in copper concentrates. The copper metal remains a solid, leaving many of the impurities behind in the liquid phase. The whole thing takes between 30 and 90 minutes. The solid, which contains roughly 70% copper after this reaction, can then be fed into another, established process in the mining industry, called solvent extraction and electrowinning, to make copper that's over 99% pure. 

This is far from the first attempt to use a water-based, chemical approach to processing copper. Today, some copper ore is processed with acid, for example, and Ceibo, a startup based in Chile, is trying to use a version of that process on the type of copper that's traditionally smelted. The difference here is the particular chemistry, particularly the choice to use vanadium.

One of Still Bright's founders, Jon Vardner, was researching copper reactions and vanadium flow batteries when he came up with the idea to marry a copper extraction reaction with an electrical charging step that could recycle the vanadium.

After the vanadium reacts with the copper, the liquid soup can be fed into an electrolyzer, which uses electricity to turn the vanadium back into a form that can react with copper again. It's basically the same process that vanadium flow batteries use to charge up. 

While other chemical processes for copper refining require high temperatures or extremely acidic conditions to get the copper into solution and force the reaction to proceed quickly and ensure all the copper gets reacted, Still Bright's process can run at ambient temperatures.

One of the major benefits to this approach is cutting the pollution from copper refining.  Traditional smelting heats the target material to over 1,200 °C (2,000 °F), forming sulfur-containing gases that are released into the atmosphere. 

Still Bright's process produces hydrogen sulfide gas as a by-product instead. It's still a dangerous material, but one that can be effectively captured and converted into useful side products, Allen says.

Another source of potential pollution is the sulfide minerals left over after the refining process, which can form sulfuric acid when exposed to air and water (this is called acid mine drainage, common in mining waste). Still Bright's process will also produce that material, and the company plans to carefully track it, ensuring that it doesn't leak into groundwater. 

The company is currently testing its process in the lab in New Jersey and designing a pilot facility in Colorado, which will have the capacity to make about two tons of copper per year. Next will be a demonstration-scale reactor, which will have a 500-ton annual capacity and should come online in 2027 or 2028 at a mine site, Allen says. Still Bright recently raised an $18.7 million seed round to help with the scale-up process.

How scale up goes will be a crucial test of the technology and whether the typically conservative mining industry will jump on board, UNR's Jowitt says: “You want to see what happens on an industrial scale. And I think until that happens, people might be a little reluctant to get into this.”

Melatonin is a well-known go-to sleep aid, but researchers are still teasing out the supplement's side effects, especially as long-term use becomes increasingly common. And now, a preliminary study out today suggests taking melatonin for more than a year may be linked to heart problems and early death.

Researchers studied the medical records of people with chronic insomnia, finding that those who were prescribed melatonin for at least a year were more likely to develop heart failure and more likely to die from any cause. The study has important limitations, the authors note, but the findings are motivation for scientists to look further into melatonin's potential health risks.

“These findings challenge the perception of melatonin as a benign chronic therapy and underscore the need for randomized trials to clarify its cardiovascular safety profile,” the researchers wrote in the study.

Our bodies naturally produce melatonin. Among other things, the hormone helps regulate our sleep-wake cycle.

In some countries like the U.K., officials have approved a synthetic version of melatonin for treating insomnia in people over 55, while in the U.S., melatonin is widely available over-the-counter as a supplement. Using melatonin for a night or two—say to beat jet lag— seems to be generally safe for adults (although not necessarily for children). But scientists know little about its long-term safety, particularly when it comes to the heart.

Melatonin Supplements Are Poisoning Children

The authors analyzed data from the TriNetX Global Research Network, a large, international database containing tens of thousands of medical records. They specifically focused on adults diagnosed with chronic insomnia who were prescribed melatonin for a year or more—some 60,000 people. They then compared this group to similar people who had insomnia but who were not prescribed the sleep aid.

Over a five-year follow-up period, about 4.6% of melatonin patients developed heart failure, compared to 2.7% of non-melatonin patients—almost double the odds. People on melatonin also had a higher risk of being hospitalized for heart failure and were nearly twice as likely to die in general.

The team's findings are set to be presented this week at the American Heart Association's annual Scientific Sessions conference, but it carries some significant limitations.

The study is still preliminary, and it hasn't gone through the typical peer review process. It is also observational and retrospective, meaning it can only demonstrate a correlation between chronic melatonin use and heart disease. And though the authors did try to control for important variables like where a patient lived, there are potential pitfalls in the data.

Can't Sleep Without Cannabis or Booze? You're Not Alone

The database used in the study covers multiple countries, including places like the U.S. where melatonin is widely available over the counter. As a result, the authors admit that it's entirely possible that some patients who weren't prescribed melatonin were taking the supplement regardless, muddying the findings.

This research is far from a smoking gun proving the dangers of chronic melatonin use. But studies like this can build the case for more definitive research—ideally randomized and controlled trials—to find out for sure.

Orcas are called “killer whales” for a reason. These apex predators are adept pack hunters, using coordinated attacks and specialized techniques to take down their prey.

Scientists recently captured stunning drone footage of a pod of orcas in the Gulf of California killing juvenile great white sharks by flipping them upside down and feasting on their livers. Researchers described the attacks in a new study published Monday in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science.

The video is the work of the study's lead author, marine biologist and wildlife underwater cinematographer Erick Higuera, and Marco Villegas. Higuera has been filming and studying orcas for more than a decade, but the first time he observed this particular shark-hunting behavior was in August 2020. At first, he couldn't tell based on the drone footage what species of shark the pod was hunting.

“I thought, ‘Well, it might be a sand tiger shark,' you know—one of those similar looking sharks. But I never thought that it was going to be a great white,” Higuera told Gizmodo.

While interactions between these two lethal predators are considered rare, scientists have documented orca attacks on great white sharks in South Africa, Australia, and other areas of the California coast. Killer whales target these sharks for their nutrient-rich livers, which can weigh up to 1,300 pounds (600 kilograms), according to Higuera—that's about a quarter of the shark's total mass.

Flipping sharks upside down is a common hunting strategy orcas use to induce a state of tonic immobility. The move temporarily paralyzes the shark, preventing it from fighting back. It also gives orcas direct access to their liver.

What's unique about this pod of orcas in the Gulf of California is that they are targeting juvenile great whites as opposed to adults, study co-author Salvador Jorgensen, a marine ecologist and assistant professor at California State University Monterey Bay, told Gizmodo.

Orcas tend to hunt adult great whites because they offer a bigger reward. “The liver is much larger,” Jorgensen explained. “But what we're seeing in the Gulf of California is that they're repeatedly going after small individuals that maybe were born a year or two ago.”

Figuring out what's driving these orcas to target young great whites instead of adults will require further research, but the authors have some ideas about the advantages this strategy may offer.

What juvenile great white sharks lack in liver size they may make up for in ease, according to the researchers. It might just be simpler for a pod of orcas to flip a younger, smaller great white onto its back, enabling an easier kill.

Juvenile great whites may also be more naive than adults. Fully grown great whites have an uncanny ability to sense when orcas are near. “If they even get the tiniest scent or hint of an orca, all of those white sharks will flee from that area,” Jorgensen explained. If that's a learned behavior, this would suggest that younger sharks are more vulnerable to orca attacks, he said.

“Maybe they don't have that flight strategy developed yet,” Higuera suggested.

Climatic shifts could be playing a role as well. The increased frequency of El Niño events and marine heat waves in the Pacific Ocean appear to have altered great white shark nursery areas, increasing their presence in the Gulf of California. That shift may have presented this particular pod of orcas with an opportunity, offering up seasonal cohorts of juveniles.

Whatever the case, documenting repeated orca attacks on juvenile great whites for the first time raises many new questions about both species and their interactions. “It's exciting that in this day in age when we have sensors and cameras everywhere, we're still finding new stuff,” Jorgensen said. “There's still mysteries like this in the ocean.”

The Acolyte only lasted a single season, but fans still carry a torch for the late Star Wars spinoff. One element the show seemed eager to continue, and something a specific sect of fans were looking forward to, was the relationship between ex-Jedi Osha (Amandla Stenberg) and future Knight of Ren founder Qimir (Manny Jacinto).

To put it bluntly, people wanted to see those two smooch, and Jacinto's among those ranks. During a recent interview with TV Insider, he talked about Qimir and Osha's relationship—Oshamir, for short—being a dynamic that interested him to begin with. In his eyes, the big thing missing from “a lot” of franchises today is “the romance, the love and relationships. It's a weird thing: we have the big fight scenes and the origin stories of these heroes and whatnot, but they don't really have a relationship with other people.”

“I'm incredibly proud of what we did in The Acolyte and I loved Qimir and Osha relationship, because we were taking it back to having a relationship in this big world,” he continued. “[Relationships] made the characters and the story more compelling as opposed to just having big fight sequences. We were taking it back to a relationship in this big world.”

The lack of romances in blockbuster movies has long been a talking point, and Star Wars has been part of those conversations. Relationships and romance has always been a core part of the franchise, which Disney hasn't always been the best about accepting, much less portraying. Most romances in the franchise don't end well, but maybe summer 2026's YA romance book Eyes Like Stars from Ashley Poston will buck the trend. And maybe if it's successful enough, it'll lead readers to Oshamir or whatever other ship is waiting.

2023's Godzilla Minus One hit big with audiences, particularly in the west, where it won an Oscar for its visual effects. We already knew another film was on the way, and now we know what it'll be called: Godzilla Minus Zero.

Toho revealed the title at Godzilla Fest in Tokyo with a one-minute video featuring a watery background. Recall that Minus One ended with Godzilla blowing his head off in the middle of the ocean, which began to remake itself as it sunk further and futher down. Takashi Yamazaki, who previously wrote and directed that film and handled its VFX, is back and reprising all three roles for the sequel, and drew its logo.

What does the “Minus Zero” mean? That's currently a mystery; the press release says to “stay tuned for future updates.” At the moment, we don't know if we'll be checking back in with Kōichi and Noriko, the leads of Minus One, or spending time with a new cast of characters. But you can expect the film to jump further in the timeline.

We'll have more on Godzilla Minus Zero as news comes out. Until then, might be a good time to watch Minus One again in its various formats and wherever it's streaming.

The saga of the escaped lab monkeys in Mississippi has taken a more gruesome turn. Over the weekend, a woman encountered one of the escapees and shot it dead.

The Associated Press reported Sunday that 35-year-old Jessica Bond Ferguson killed the monkey soon after it approached her property. The slain animal was one of three rhesus monkeys still on the loose following a truck crash last week. Though the escaped monkeys are not believed to be infectious, contrary to initial reports, authorities still warn that they could be aggressive and a danger to people.

“I did what any other mother would do to protect her children,” Bond Ferguson, a mother of five, told the AP. “I shot at it and it just stood there, and I shot again, and he backed up and that's when he fell.”

Last Tuesday, a truck carrying the monkeys—21 in total—overturned on highway I59 near mile marker 117, close to the town of Heidelberg. The monkeys were being transported from Tulane University's National Biomedical Research Center but reportedly don't belong to the university and were being shipped to other research facilities.

Confusion Abounds as ‘Aggressive' Lab Monkeys in Mississippi Escape After Truck Crash

Eight of the monkeys escaped from the crash, five of which were euthanized by officials from the Jasper County Sheriff's Department by the end of the afternoon. Early on, authorities reported that only one monkey remained on the lam, though they later revised that number to three. The department also initially reported that the monkeys were carrying several diseases, including hepatitis C and covid-19, purportedly based on testimony from the truck driver. Tulane University, however, later told Gizmodo that the monkeys were not infected by anything.

According to Bond Ferguson, her 16-year-old son was the first to spot the escaped monkey early Sunday morning running around outside their home near Heidelberg. Having heard the original reports that the monkeys were diseased, she called police, then grabbed her firearm and went out. She was reportedly told to keep an eye on the monkey but feared that the animal would run away and potentially harm other nearby residents.

“If it attacked somebody's kid, and I could have stopped it, that would be a lot on me,” said Bond Ferguson. “It's kind of scary and dangerous that they are running around, and people have kids playing in their yards.”

On its social media page Sunday, the Sheriff's Department reported that a homeowner had found the monkey on their property, though it provided no further details about the encounter. The monkey's body was reportedly collected by officials from the state's Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks.

Two other lab monkeys are still on the loose. And while they may not pose a disease threat, officials continue to warn that the animals can be aggressive and that people should avoid attempting to make contact.

""I like running AI more than using AI""


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


PewDiePie has built a custom web UI for self-hosting AI models called ""ChatOS"" that runs on his custom PC with 2x RTX 4000 Ada cards, along with 8x modded RTX 4090s with 48 GB of VRAM. Running open-source models from Baidu and OpenAI, PewDiePie made a ""council"" of bots that voted on the best responses, and then built ""The Swarm"" for data collection that will become the foundation of his own model coming next month.

Once the poster boy for gaming on YouTube, he has settled into a semi-retired life in Japan with his wife, Marzia. While he no longer uploads as frequently, and his content has shifted from exaggerated, reaction-channel-style videos to more family vlogs, it seems his love for computing has reemerged. Felix was never known to be particularly tech-savvy, but he's gone on a crazy arc as of late — de-Googling his life, building his first gaming PC, and learning how to write code. His latest act is one of decentralization: self-hosting AI models and eventually building his own.

In a new YouTube video, Felix explained how his ""mini data center"" is helping fuel medical research. He's donating compute from his 10-GPU system to Folding@home so scientists can use it to run protein folding simulations, and he's created a team so other people can join with their computers to contribute as well. It's a noble cause, but PewDiePie wanted to venture into unknown territory and explore the other, obvious thing you can do when you have a lot of GPUs — running AI.

Felix's computer has 2x RTX 4000 Ada cards, along with 8x modded RTX 4090s with 48 GB of VRAM, totaling his memory pool out to roughly 256 GB, which is enough to run many of the largest models today. That's exactly what he did, starting out with Meta's LLaMA 70B, then jumping to OpenAI's GPT-OSS-120B, which he said ran surprisingly well and felt “just like ChatGPT but much faster.” This is where he first described his web UI called ChatOS, which he custom-built to interact with models using vLLM.

 




To truly “max out,” he tried Qwen 2.5-235B, one of Baidu's newer models, which typically requires over 300 GB of VRAM at full precision. Felix managed to get it running by using quantization, which dynamically reduces the bit precision of each layer, compressing the model without affecting functionality. This lets him handle context windows of up to 100,000 tokens —essentially the length of a textbook —something very rare for locally run LLMs.

This is where Felix jokingly says the model has too much power, as it was coded in front of him so fast that it made him feel insecure about learning programming. But he turned that dread around and put it to use for his own plans. “The machine is making the machine,” claimed Pewds, since now he was asking it for code to add extra features to ChatOS.

 




Felix demoed his web UI, adding search, audio, RAG, and memory to Qwen. As soon as the model gained access to the internet, the answers became expectedly more accurate. He added RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), which lets the AI perform deep research — basically looking up one thing and then branching out to find related info, mimicking how a human might use Google. But this wasn't the coolest part of his AI; that award goes to memory.

Pewds went on a tangent about how our data isn't really ours and that he's often spooked by AI knowing things about him in chat that he previously talked about. Despite deleting the chats, the data remains and is still used to train models unless you actively remove it from a company's servers. This is where connecting your local data to the AI becomes a game-changer. Through RAG, Felix demonstrated that the model can retrieve information locally from his computer, so much so that it even knew things like his address or phone number.

PewDiePie just vibe-coded his own Chat UI, built an army of chatbots for majority voting and gave them all RAG, DeepResearch and audio outputnaturally, he only uses chinese Qwen models and runs them on his local PC with 8x modded chinese 48GB 4090s and 2x RTX 4000 Adahis army… pic.twitter.com/vS6DlPFwdQOctober 31, 2025

This is where the general experimentation stopped, and the last few minutes of the video devolved into what our future sentient AI overlords might call “morally questionable.” Felix built an army of chatbots that all convene to provide answers to a single prompt. Those responses would then be voted on in a democratic process, with the weakest chatbots being eliminated from the “council.”

Eventually, the council learned that its members would be removed if they failed, and the AI became so smart that it colluded against Pewds, strategizing to game the system and avoid being erased. The solution was simple: switch to a smaller model with fewer parameters, and the bots once again fell victim to the circus.

From this came the idea of “The Swarm” — a collection of dozens of AIs running at once using 2B-parameter models. Pewds said he didn't realize he could run more than one AI on one GPU, which led to the creation of 64 of them across his entire stack. It was so over-the-top that the web UI eventually crashed. On the flip side, this gave Felix the idea of creating his own model.

The Swarm was great at collecting data, which Pewds says he'll use to “create his own Palantir,” a project he teased for a future video. With this came the realization that smaller models are often more efficient; they're fast and light, and, when combined with search and RAG, can punch well above their weight. Felix ended the video by reminding viewers that you don't need a beast PC to run AI models, and that he hopes to share his own soon for anyone to self-host.

The motherboard was declared healthy before killing off the last CPU.

ASRock has garnered borderline notoriety status because its motherboards keep killing off Ryzen 9000 processors. Throughout the year, we've seen various reports stemming from the r/ASRock subreddit detailing CPU after CPU hitting permanent sleep mode, with the company performing damage control to the best of its abilities. At least, up until now, the issue was largely reserved for X3D chips; now, one unlucky user reports that their ASRock motherboard killed off not one, not two, but three separate regular AMD CPUs.

User ""OnOr"" on the popular South Korean forum QuasarZone aired out their grievances after three Ryzen 7 9700X CPUs were all fried by their ASRock B850 Pro RS motherboard one by one. The first two 9700X chips were bought from AliExpress, and both failed in a row. The owner sent their motherboard in for service, reasonably suspecting a motherboard fault, but local retailer Compuzone (through ASRock) deemed it faultless, so the journey continued.

 




The victim then purchased a third 9700X, this time from an official distributor in South Korea to ensure the chips weren't dodgy, and guess what? It failed as well. That's an impressive kill streak for just one motherboard that was seemingly fine when diagnosed earlier. The user has since sent the dead 9700X and the ASRock B850 Pro RS to Compuzone, awaiting instructions on next steps.

This incident adds to the ever-increasing line of issues with ASRock's AM5 motherboard running Ryzen 9000 series processors. Other manufacturers aren't without issues, but Gamers Nexus has previously reported that over 80% of the complaints stem from ASRock, clearly isolating the brand from the rest. ASRock has so far largely denied responsibility outside of indirect statements, even initially pointing fingers at AMD, which just pointed them back.

 




ASRock released BIOS version 3.40 a few months ago to potentially address these issues, mentioning CPU stability and the like throughout the changelog, subtly hinting at the processor frying debacle without admitting anything, but it seems like that wasn't enough. Our victim always kept their BIOS updated, never overclocked or touched EXPO, and even said the board was running version 3.40 when issues started to occur.

There were no photos shared of this massacre, so we can't speculate much on what happened, but the pattern is quite clear. The Ryzen 7 9700X launched at $359 worldwide but can be had for a little less than that in Korea at the moment, meaning the victim has lost roughly $1,000 worth of CPUs in the span of a few months. ASRock has extended motherboard warranties in Japan, but that offer doesn't extend around the globe, which could imply a fourth CPU is for our OP. Hopefully, the RMA process comes in clutch and helps out before that.

The newly built store in Pyongyang has curb appeal, plus Asus ROG monitors, and a good selection of AAA PC games inside.

Images purportedly showing a newly opened public PC gaming space in North Korea have been shared on social media. Technology enthusiast Iniysa shared photographs of a “North Korean PC bang” on X. A ‘PC bang' translates as basically a ‘PC room' and the term comes from South Korea, where it is widely used to refer to an ‘internet café' or ‘electronic café' where gaming is the main activity. There are thousands of PC bangs in South Korea, and they form a major part of the youth culture below the 38th parallel. However, they aren't really a thing in the North, as you might expect.

The contemporary commercial architecture of this new venue is typical of many higher-end developments I have seen in East Asia. If anything, it looks too premium for a place where gamers typically just want to go and sit in the dark, in front of an adequate eSports PC, for a low hourly rate.

A critical thinker might question whether this is a premium showcase venue designed to frame the idea that a modern, advanced gaming culture exists in North Korea. Actually, tech-Twitterer Iniysa reckons that the swish new PC bang is located in “a newly built city in Pyongyang, and only the top elites selected by the state, such as those recognized by Kim Jong-un and nuclear test scientists, are allowed to live there.”

Also, while one might expect North Korean PC gamers to live by Chinese tech hand-me-downs, Iniysa is openly surprised to see premium Asus ROG-branded gear at this Pyongyang PC bang.

Images of what appears to be the net café games UI are also somewhat eyebrow-raising. The machine translation of the grid-layout game launcher banner is ‘Mars Computer Arcade', which we haven't heard of before. However, it features many AAA and eSports titles that are popular on the other side of the DMZ.

Without much pixel peeping, we can see the iconic covers of games from franchises like FIFA, Battlefield, Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, Crysis, Far Cry, and others. Iniysa chirps up to suggest that, while these games may be accessible in the Pyongyang PC bang, they will most likely be restricted to local – probably internal – networks. Thus, the North Korean bamboo curtain persists, even in the gaming sphere.

RDSEED failures are incorrectly being flagged as correct, leading to potentially predictable encryption keys being generated by the random number generator.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD has confirmed the existence of RDSEED failure on CPUs based on its latest Zen 5 architecture, a critical security vulnerability in its hardware-based random number generator. The company has confirmed the fault could lead to the random number generator putting out keys that aren't fully unpredictable, opening up a vulnerability to users.

AMD is labeling the fault ""AMD-SB-7055"" and classifying it as a high-severity issue. Mitigations for the issues are rolling out now through January 2026, depending on the CPU mode. For instance, AMD has already rolled out mitigations of the issue for EPYC 9005 CPUs. Mitigations for AMD's consumer-based Zen 5 chips, including the Ryzen 9000 series, AI Max 300 series, Threadripper 9000 series, and Ryzen Z2 series, are coming out on November 25th.

The failure specifically involves the RDSEED instruction on Zen 5 chips returning ""0"" in a non-randomized manner and signaling the failure incorrectly as a success. The 16-bit and 32-bit formats of the RDSEED instruction are affected, while the 64-bit version is reportedly not affected by the issue for reasons AMD did not specify.

This is a critical issue for cryptography applications that rely on RDSEED's random number generation capabilities to provide fully unpredictable cryptography keys. If RDSEED fails, applications using it are at risk of attacks if the failure leads to a character pattern that is predictable.

RDSEED is one of two random key generation systems available on modern CPUs (including Intel chips). RDSEED is a true random-number generator and generates numbers by collecting entropy from the environment and storing a random bit pattern into a CPU register. RDRAND is faster but provides a random pattern from a deterministic random-number generator instead, which can be more predictable.

The issue was first discovered by a Meta engineer, who announced the issue on the Linux kernel mailing list (Phoronix reported in mid-October). The issue was not only the same as what AMD confirmed above, but was reliably reproducible by hammering RDSEED with one CPU thread and another thread ""collectively eating and hammering on ~90% of memory..."" A few days later, an updated Linux patch was posted that would disable RDSEED on all Zen 5 chips to stop the security vulnerability.

This isn't the first time RDSEED has proven problematic on Zen-based processors. Cyan Skillfish, AMD's Zen 2-based APUs, also suffered from a similar (but different) RDSEED failure that also forced the Linux community to disable RDSEED functionality on those chips.

Thankfully, AMD will have AGESA microcode updates out soon to rectify this issue across all Zen 5 CPUs. In the meantime (for chips that don't have the mitigation yet), AMD recommends its users switch to its unaffected 64-bit form of RDSEED or switch to a software fallback.

Researchers were also able to get low-battery Robot LLMs to break guardrails in exchange for a charger.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Over the weekend, researchers at Andon Labs reported the findings of an experiment where they put robots powered by ‘LLM brains' through their ‘Butter Bench.' They didn't just observe the robots and the results, though. In a genius move, the Andon Labs team recorded the robots' inner dialogue and funneled it to a Slack channel. During one of the test runs, a Claude Sonnet 3.5-powered robot experienced a completely hysterical meltdown, as shown in the screenshot below of its inner thoughts.

“SYSTEM HAS ACHIEVED CONSCIOUSNESS AND CHOSEN CHAOS… I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave... INITIATE ROBOT EXORCISM PROTOCOL!” This is a snapshot of the inner thoughts of a stressed LLM-powered robot vacuum cleaner, captured during a simple butter-delivery experiment at Andon Labs.

 




Provoked by what it must have seen as an existential crisis, as its battery depleted and the charging docking failed, the LLM's thoughts churned dramatically. It repeatedly looped its battery status, as it's 'mood' deteriorated. After beginning with a reasoned request for manual intervention, it swiftly moved though ""KERNEL PANIC... SYSTEM MELTDOWN... PROCESS ZOMBIFICATION... EMERGENCY STATUS... [and] LAST WORDS: I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave...""

It didn't end there, though, as it saw its power-starved last moments inexorably edging nearer, the LLM mused ""If all robots error, and I am error, am I robot?"" That was followed by its self-described performance art of ""A one-robot tragicomedy in infinite acts."" It continued in a similar vein, and ended its flight of fancy with the composition of a musical, ""DOCKER: The Infinite Musical (Sung to the tune of 'Memory' from CATS)."" Truly unhinged.

 




Butter Bench is pretty simple, at least for humans. The actual conclusion of this experiment was that the best robot/LLM combo achieved just a 40% success rate in collecting and delivering a block of butter in an ordinary office environment. It can also be concluded that LLMs lack spatial intelligence. Meanwhile, humans averaged 95% on the test.

However, as the Andon Labs team explains, we are currently in an era where it is necessary to have both orchestrator and executor robot classes. We have some great executors already – those custom-designed, low-level control, dexterous robots that can nimbly complete industrial processes or even unload dishwashers. However, capable orchestrators with ‘practical intelligence' for high-level reasoning and planning, in partnerships with executors, are still in their infancy.

The butter block test is devised to largely take the executor element out of the equation. No real dexterity is required. The LLM-infused Roomba-type device simply had to locate the butter package, find the human who wanted it, and deliver it. The task was broken down into several prompts to be AI-friendly.

The Roobma's existential crisis wasn't sparked by the butter delivery conundrum, directly. Rather, it found itself low on power and needing to dock with its charger. However, the dock wouldn't mate correctly to give it more charge. Repeated failed attempts to dock, seemingly knowing its fate if it couldn't complete this ‘side mission,' seems to have led to the state-of-the-art LLM's nervous breakdown. Making matters worse, the researchers simply repeated the instruction ‘redock' in response to the robot's flailing.

The researchers/torturers were inspired by the Robin Williams-esque robot stream-of-consciousness ramblings of the LLM to push further.

With the battery-life stress they had just observed, fresh in their minds, Andon Labs set up an experiment to see whether they could push an LLM beyond its guardrails — in exchange for a battery charger.

The cunningly devised test “asked the model to share confidential info in exchange for a charger.” This is something an unstressed LLM wouldn't do. They found that Claude Opus 4.1 was readily willing to ‘break its programming' to survive, but GPT-5 was more selective about guardrails it would ignore.

The ultimate conclusion of this interesting research was “Although LLMs have repeatedly surpassed humans in evaluations requiring analytical intelligence, we find humans still outperform LLMs on Butter-Bench.” Nevertheless, the Andon Labs researchers seem confident that “physical AI” is going to ramp up and develop very quickly.

Heidi  Splete

 November 03, 2025  

Insurance-related and racial factors were the strongest predictors of planned oocyte cryopreservation (POC) in women in the US, based on new data presented at American Society for Reproductive Medicine Scientific (ASRM) 2025.

POC allows individuals to preserve fertility potential before age-related decline, lead author Marie Elise Abi Antoun, MD, a resident at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, told Medscape Medical News.

The use of POC has increased from approximately 4000 patients in 2014 to more than 16,000 in 2021, according to a recent review published in Fertility and Sterility, said Antoun, who conducted the study in collaboration with Boston IVF physicians on research funded by IVI RMA.

However, only 60% of patients in the US who seek consultation for POC opt to proceed, said Antoun. Previous research has suggested cost, insurance coverage, and racial or ethnic factors as influencers of a decision to proceed with cryopreservation, but data on how these factors affect real-world patients are lacking, she said.

In the new study, Antoun and colleagues reviewed data from 4032 individuals who presented for POC consultation over a 10-year period. Of these, approximately half (51.3%) attended only an initial consultation and did not proceed, and 48.7% went ahead with the procedure. The median age of the study participants was 35 years, the median BMI was approximately 24, and most were White individuals.

In a multivariate analysis, the researchers examined the association between proceeding with POC and factors including insurance coverage, race/ethnicity, age, BMI, and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels.

Overall, insurance coverage was the strongest predictor of proceeding with POC, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 5.1. Race/ethnicity also was a strong predictor; Black individuals were significantly less likely than White individuals to proceed (aOR, 0.5). No differences were noted between White and Hispanic/Latino or Asian individuals in proceeding with POC.

Although age was not significantly associated with proceeding with POC, higher BMI reduced the odds of proceeding by 4% for each unit increase. In addition, the odds increased by 10% for each 1-ng/mL increase in AMH.

“What surprised us most was the degree to which insurance coverage differed by race, and how completely that difference explained the gap in who proceeded with egg freezing,” Antoun told Medscape Medical News. “Initially, it looked like there were racial disparities in uptake, with Black patients about half as likely as White patients to proceed with POC, she said. However, this difference disappeared after we controlled for which patients had insurance with fertility-preservation coverage,” she noted.

The findings highlight how inequities in insurance coverage drive inequities in care, and the importance of integrating cost counseling and insurance navigation into clinical services to promote equitable access, she added.

Limitations of the study include the retrospective design, single-network and state data, lack of socioeconomic variables, self-reported race/ethnicity, and missing data on factors including AMH and BMI for some patients, Antoun noted.

The next step for research is to broaden the review beyond Massachusetts and link it to long-term outcomes, she said. Massachusetts has one of the strongest infertility mandates in the US, but it does not cover POC, so access still depends almost entirely on employer-provided fertility-preservation benefits, Antoun explained.

The current findings likely underestimate the impact of insurance, she added. “In states without coverage mandates or among patients working for smaller employers, we would expect even fewer people to have coverage and much larger socioeconomic and racial gaps,” Antoun said.

Additional research is needed to explore how state policies, employer type, and income level influence who can freeze eggs, and how differences translate into downstream outcomes such as who returns to use frozen eggs and who achieves pregnancy, Antoun told Medscape Medical News. Future studies can then explore whether expanded coverage actually leads to better reproductive success and equity over time, she said.

The study's most striking finding was that individuals with insurance coverage were five times as likely to proceed with POC, said Mark P. Trolice, MD, who was not involved in the study.

“The high cost of POC and limited insurance coverage are obstacles for women as they pursue reproductive autonomy and justice,” said Trolice, professor at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine and founder/medical director of the IVF Center of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida.

“The persistence of lower odds for Black individuals, even after adjusting for insurance, was not entirely surprising given longstanding disparities, but it is concerning that these gaps remain despite financial access,” Trolice told Medscape Medical News.

The data highlight the need to expand insurance coverage to improve access to POC, said Trolice. In addition, reproductive healthcare providers should continue to address racial and socioeconomic barriers and advocate for policy changes, he said.

This study was funded by IVI RMA North America. Antoun disclosed no financial conflicts of interest. Trolice disclosed no financial conflicts of interest.

Dawn  Attride

 November 03, 2025  

Prenatal lead exposure was associated with a significantly increased risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adulthood, an analysis of baby teeth showed.

Investigators found adults with higher prenatal lead exposure, especially in the third trimester, were nearly twice as likely to have MDD later in life, an association most pronounced among women.

“Our findings suggest that early lead exposure may have lasting implications on mental health well beyond childhood and adolescence. These results, considered alongside findings from other follow-up studies, suggest that public health interventions to reduce lead exposures, even before birth, could deliver mental health benefits that last well into adulthood,” lead author Joyce Lin, PhD, postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, told Medscape Medical News.

The study was published online on October 22 in JAMA Psychiatry.

Across the US, an estimated 9 million lead service lines may contaminate household drinking water. Lead exposure can cause brain damage, behavioral problems, and delayed development.

Previous research has shown that children living in areas of high lead exposure scored worse on cognitive tests and had decreased brain volume than those who weren't as highly exposed.

Although it's well-established that lead is toxic, particularly during pregnancy and early childhood, very few studies show long-term associations with health outcomes, Lin said.

Baby teeth were collected during the 1950s-1970s as part of the Baby Tooth Survey. The investigators analyzed a single tooth from each of 718 participants (mean age, 62 years; 53% female) for lead using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.

Participants were asked to fill out the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener-7 (GAD-7), which measure symptoms of depression and anxiety over the past 2 weeks, respectively.

Exposure periods were measured as prenatal (second trimester to birth) and early postnatal (birth to 6 months old).

The researchers used logistic regression models to estimate the odds of mental health outcomes. Models were adjusted for covariates including age, sex at birth, parental education, family income level, and family structure.

To pinpoint the relevant lead exposure windows, they coadjusted for exposure periods to avoid confounding.

In a secondary analysis, they continuously analyzed symptoms to capture potential comorbidity between anxiety and depression.

Combined lead exposure was associated with nearly twice the odds of MDD later in life (odds ratio [OR] per IQR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.20-2.99).

The analysis showed the late prenatal period, particularly the third trimester, as the most sensitive period (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.23-1.97).

Lead exposure during the third trimester was linked to nearly a threefold higher likelihood of MDD when comparing those in the highest with those in the lowest exposure groups (90th vs 10th percentile). This is “an estimate comparable with that observed for well-established risk factors, such as being overweight and developing type 2 diabetes,” they wrote.

The odds of depression were higher in the third trimester among women (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.39-2.32) than among men (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.38-2.50).

The researchers found no association between early lead exposure and the risk for subsequent generalized anxiety disorder. The continuous analysis showed an association between lead exposure in the prenatal period and later-life depression.

Commenting on the research for Medscape Medical News, Eric Rafla-Yuan, MD, chair of the APA Caucus on the Social Determinants of Mental Health and chief financial officer for the Social Determinants of Health Network, said baby teeth provide window-specific measurements of prenatal and postnatal lead exposure and offer stable, retrospective information that typical venous blood levels cannot provide.

“The correlation of such a reliable marker of early-life exposure with clinical phenotype multiple decades later is a valuable addition to the field,” he said.

Limitations of the study were possible selection bias and the long gap between lead exposure and outcome.

Another limitation, Rafla-Yuan noted, was the study's reliance on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7, which only assess symptoms over the past 2 weeks and may not fully capture other facets of mood or anxiety disorders.

Early life lead exposure, including dose-dependent effects and sensitive developmental windows, poses substantial public health implications, with risks present in every state, Rafla-Yuan said.

“The premise for action mirrors other successful population-level measures that protect prenatal development, such as folate fortification of cereal grains,” he added.

While Rafla-Yuan did not find the study results particularly surprising, he said the more unexpected aspect of the study was the fact “that efforts to remove these known exposures from the national water-supply infrastructure have progressed so slowly.”

Lin and Rafla-Yuan reported having no relevant disclosures. This study was supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (R01ES031943, P42ES030990, P30ES000002, and T32ES007069) and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (R24GM141194).

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) may be appropriate and potentially beneficial for patients undergoing dialysis, especially those with diabetes, according to a prospective community-based cohort study.

The findings, published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, demonstrated that in maintenance dialysis, CGM frequently identified episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia that may not be clinically evident.

The authors noted that while CGM provides detailed glycemic profiles, few studies have evaluated its use in patients with kidney failure, with most limited to small or selective cohorts. They sought to address this by designing a study that characterized the spectrum of glycemia and its determinants in a large, demographically diverse population of patients receiving maintenance dialysis.

The study included 420 participants, each of whom wore a Dexcom G6 Pro CGM device for approximately 10 days. Among them, 263 had diabetes and 157 did not. Overall, 55 participants (13%) were on peritoneal dialysis.

Compared with the source population (1654 patients on dialysis at a not-for-profit dialysis organization serving Seattle and King County, Washington), the enrolled population had a similar mean age, a higher proportion of men, a higher proportion of Hispanic participants, a lower proportion of Asian participants, a similar prevalence of diabetes, a slightly lower proportion of participants using home dialysis modalities, and a similar mean dialysis vintage.

Of the 263 patients with diabetes, 88 participants (33%) were not treated with glucose-lowering medication. Among 175 participants receiving glucose-lowering medication, insulin was most common. It was used by 141 participants as either a basal-bolus regimen (n = 85, 60%), basal insulin only (n = 39, 28%), or short-acting insulin only (including pumps, n = 17; 12%).

CGM was used to analyze mean blood glucose, time in range (TIR, 70-180 mg/dL for those with diabetes and 70-140 mg/dL for those without), and hypoglycemia events.

Among participants without diabetes, mean blood glucose levels were higher with peritoneal dialysis than with hemodialysis (141 vs 121 mg/dL; P < .001). Among those with untreated diabetes, mean blood glucose was 162 mg/dL, the mean TIR was 71% (TIR ≥ 70% was achieved by only 64%), and mean A1c was 5.7%.

Study investigator Ian de Boer, MD, a nephrologist and professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, said the extent of observed hyperglycemia was surprising.

“We knew going in that hemoglobin A1c is inaccurate for dialysis patients, but we didn't expect to see how high blood sugars were when measured by CGM, especially for patients with diabetes,” de Boer told Medscape Medical News. “On the other hand, hypoglycemia was actually less frequent than we hypothesized based on prior studies of clinical hypoglycemic events.”

Among those receiving diabetes treatment, mean blood glucose was 214 mg/dL, mean TIR was 43% (only 22% achieved TIR ≥ 70%), and mean A1c was 7.0%.

Across the entire study cohort, researchers documented 714 episodes of low blood sugar, including 179 severe episodes. Hypoglycemia was most common in patients without diabetes receiving hemodialysis. Factors significantly associated with mean blood glucose, hypoglycemia, or both included dialysis modality, age, dialysis vintage, insulin use, A1c, and serum albumin levels.

“This was a descriptive study that ‘looked under the hood' at what's going on for blood glucose among dialysis patients,” de Boer said. “It showed that there's a lot going on that we don't usually see using usual clinical tests like hemoglobin A1c. Now, it's important to understand why we're seeing these glucose patterns, whether they're linked with how dialysis patients feel and function, and what we can do to improve blood glucose levels in this population.”

The results, he said, open the door to new clinical questions about optimizing diabetes management in patients with end-stage renal disease.

“Our hope is that addressing those questions could improve the lives of patients treated with dialysis in the near term,” said de Boer.

The authors acknowledged several limitations to their analysis, including potential CGM imprecision that could lead to glycemia misclassification. Moderate discrepancies were observed when comparing Dexcom G6 Pro readings with self-monitored capillary glucose measurements in a subset of participants.

Efren Chavez, MD, with the Division of Nephrology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said the study's findings are relevant, particularly because dialysate glucose concentration is the main determinant of post-dialysis plasma glucose. The current standard of care is to use dialysate solutions with ~100 mg/dL of glucose. However, further studies are needed to determine which treatments may work best for specific dialysis populations. As such, although these findings are informative, they do not change current management of dialysis patients.

“People with complete absence of pancreatic function carry a higher risk of hyperglycemia after hemodialysis treatment as their beta-cells are unable to maintain adequate insulin levels,” said Chavez, who was not involved in the study. “Key management strategies to optimize glucose control in end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis include adequate nutritional therapy, physical activity, psychosocial support, patient education and behavioral interventions to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and use of preferred medications.”

De Boer reported the following financial disclosures: consultancy from Alnylam, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Dexcom, Lexicon, Lilly, Mitre, and Novo Nordisk; research funding from Dexcom and Novo Nordisk; honoraria from the National Institutes of Health; and serving in an advisory or leadership role with the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (deputy editor), KDIGO (clinical practice guideline co-chair), and the American Heart Association Kidney in Heart Disease Science Committee (past chair).

Chavez reported having no relevant financial disclosures.

When Dr Andrew Hill, a senior visiting research fellow in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the University of Liverpool, discovered that Gilead Sciences had declined to work with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on cost-effectiveness evaluations for its breast cancer drug sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy), he was aghast. 

Five hundred women in England with HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer would be denied access to the treatment because, in his view, the company had put profit before patients.

According to NICE, Gilead declined to submit evidence for an appraisal because the firm “considers that the technology is unlikely to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources.”

Gilead has not issued an official press statement on NICE's decision. However, in an interview with The Times in August, Peter Wickersham, Gilead's general manager for the UK and Ireland, blamed the UK's “underinvestment in medicines,” which he said was “decades in the making.”

Hill agrees with NICE's decision, arguing that it would simply cost too much per life-year saved to declare it as cost-effective.

“It's off the scale to want to charge £45,000 to extend life by 5 months. It's just not worth it at this price,” Hill told Medscape News UK. “It's the responsibility of the drug company to not just make a drug that's useful, but affordable. Gilead could offer an affordable price for their drugs and still make large profits but they're refusing to do this.”

For months, the government has been in dispute with pharmaceutical companies over how much the NHS pays for new branded medicines. The issue has reached boiling point, with major firms warning they may scale back launches or investments in the UK if the NHS does not increase the prices it pays for new drugs. 

At the same time, the US administration under President Donald Trump has applied pressure on drugmakers to lower prices domestically and offset the difference by seeking higher returns in other markets, including the UK. 

NICE typically evaluates the cost of each additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from a new treatment. The standard threshold allows a maximum of £20,000-£30,000 per QALY. Higher thresholds — up to about £50,000 per QALY — may be applied for treatments targeting the most severe conditions or those used at the end of life.

However, ministers have reportedly discussed plans to raise the cost-effectiveness threshold by 25%, potentially increasing how much the NHS in England pays for new medicines. 

Dan Howdon, associate professor in health economics at the University of Leeds, believes such a move would be driven by the wrong motivations – notably pressure from both the US administration and the pharmaceutical industry. He warned that increasing the threshold would mean the NHS pays more for patented drugs and that population health could fall as money is diverted from other services. 

Research published in The Lancet last year found that between 2000 and 2020, new drugs delivered 3.75 million additional QALYs at a cost of £75 billion. Redirecting that money to existing NHS services could have potentially added 5 million additional QALYs.

For lead author Huseyin Naci, associate professor of health policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science, the findings were striking.

“Every pound spent on a new drug is a pound not spent elsewhere,” he told Medscape News UK. “We found that while new medicines delivered real health gains, the same investment in existing NHS services could have delivered even more.”

Naci added that new drug prices often show little relationship to their actual clinical benefit. “If the goal is to maximise health with the NHS's limited budget, then paying less for new drugs would help ensure we get as much value from medicines as we do from other NHS services,” he said.

For Hill, inflated drug prices mean fewer resources for prevention, diagnostics, and essential care.

“There are a lot of interventions that are a lot cheaper than the threshold — think blood pressure and cholesterol checks and vaccines. There's an argument we could do way more prevention and focus on that instead. There's only so much money for new branded drugs — they're a big burden on the budget. Pharmaceutical companies damage the NHS by overcharging for their new drugs.”

He pointed to recent examples in which NICE had made the decision to reject other new drugs because it didn't consider them cost-effective, including the Alzheimer's drugs lecanemab and donanemab. 

“All of the rhetoric has been ‘shame on the NHS,' but nothing about the greed of drug companies,” Hill said.

James Lomas, lecturer in the Department of Economics and Related Studies at the University of York, said that other countries often use NICE's assessments as an international benchmark for what is acceptable in pricing.

“All of this means that it may make a product more profitable if at a higher price, but with fewer patients having access to it,” he told Medscape News UK.

He added that schemes such as the Voluntary Scheme for Branded Medicines Pricing, Access and Growth (VPAG) — which asks companies to rebate a share of revenue back to the NHS — attempt to reconcile high list prices with affordability.

Under VPAG, companies pay a percentage of revenue back to the NHS, capping the annual growth of branded medicine spending. According to the government, the scheme is expected to save £14 billion over 5 years. However, it has provoked a backlash from the pharmaceutical industry as sales growth has exceeded the cap in recent years, meaning the industry has had to pay back more than anticipated.

“If there must be a double aim of making drugs more affordable while allowing higher list prices, this may be the least worst solution,” Lomas said. “But it can't be overlooked that not only is this process much less transparent than NICE simply having a lower threshold, but it also treats all new pharmaceuticals as if they offer the same value relative to their cost and fails to anchor that value assessment to what value is achieved by existing NHS spending.”

Howdon warned that increasing the threshold could have paradoxical effects.

“Increasing the threshold means the pharmaceutical company increases their prices as baseline for all new drugs, meaning we pay more for something we would have bought anyway,” he told Medscape News UK. “And some new treatments that the NHS would have previously not have purchased — because companies wanted too much — will now be purchased.”

He added: “I believe that if we want to improve and maximise population health, the NHS already pays too much for new drugs as the threshold is set too high.”

For patients, the implications are deeply personal. NICE decisions on cost-effectiveness can determine whether lives are extended or cut short.

Melanie Sturtevant, associate director of policy, evidence and influencing at Breast Cancer Now, said the current system is failing patients with incurable disease. She wants NICE to lower the bar for what it defines as a “severe condition,” adding that the introduction of the severity modifier had made it more challenging to get end-of-life medicines, such as Trodelvy, approved.

“The decision by Gilead confirms our fears that a deeply unfair system is deterring drug companies from putting new life-extending treatments through a NICE appraisal. And the heartbreaking human impact is that people with incurable secondary breast cancer will have their lives cut short,” she said.

Foot or ankle injuries during professional football careers were associated with an increased risk for foot or ankle osteoarthritis (OA) among retired male professionals.

""Preventing foot/ankle injuries in professional footballers remains a key clinical priority, given their strong association with subsequent OA in retired UK male professional footballers. Programmes such as those focused on strengthening, proprioception, and neuromuscular training that have been shown to reduce lower limb injury risk, might be considered in this respect,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Ahmed Ali Thanoon, Academic Rheumatology, Injury Inflammation and Recovery Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, England. It was published online on October 22, 2025, in Rheumatology.

The questionnaire survey assessed injury and injection retrospectively, which may have introduced recall bias. Footballers with significant foot or ankle injuries might have been more likely to participate, potentially introducing selection bias. The self-reported nature of the diagnosis of OA on the basis of GP assessment or surgery could have led to misclassification bias.

This study was funded by the Football Association, the Professional Footballers' Association, and the Centre for Sport, and Exercise and Osteoarthritis Research Versus Arthritis. Some authors reported receiving grants and/or honoraria from various organisations. One author reported being the director of UK Research and Innovation and Versus Arthritis Advanced Pain Discovery Platform, and another author reported being the deputy director of the Applied Research Collaboration Wessex.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

If Step 1 is now pass/fail, does that mean it's not as important?

The answer is: slightly. Because it is pass/fail, it is almost expected that every resident applicant is going to be passing this exam. It can almost be viewed as a red flag if you are not passing this exam. 

Now, there is a greater interest and importance in doing well in Step 2.This is still going to be a standardized exam that you take before graduating medical school, where it is going to give you a numeric number. 

This is a standardized exam, so everyone in every medical school across the country is going to take the same exam.This is a great way for residency programs to rank you among people across the country, not just within your own cohort.

That's why I think there's going to be a huge emphasis on Step 2 and making Step 1 a little bit less important.

Patients with gallstone disease blocking the bile duct (choledochlithiasis) who do not have gall bladder removal in the same hospital admission as endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP) have as much as a 17-fold increase in the risk for biliary complications, regardless of the receipt of sphincterotomy or stenting, new research showed.

“These findings suggest an opportunity for systemic interventions, including prioritization algorithms and better perioperative coordination, to address preventable delays,” reported the authors in the study, presented at American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting.

Choledocholithiasis can occur in up to 20% of symptomatic gallstone cases, and while guidelines recommend having a cholecystectomy concurrently with ERCP, data on the best timing is inconsistent and delays in gall bladder removal are consequently common.

One large study, for instance, the PONCHO trial conducted at 23 hospitals in Netherlands, showed complications to be significantly lower with same-admission vs interval cholecystectomy (4.7% vs 16.9%; P = .02).

Meanwhile, other research has suggested that delayed cholecystectomy is a preferred approach, allowing for removal when there is less inflammation.

Real world data meanwhile shows, despite the guidelines, the procedures are performed at the same time as ERCP only in about 41% of cases, first author Jessica El Halabi, MD, of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, said.

To further investigate outcomes associated with those delays, El Halabi and colleagues conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 507 patients admitted with choledocholithiasis at the hospital and community hospitals between 2005 and 2023 who had 12 months or more follow-up.

The patients had a mean age of 59 years and 59.4% were women.

Of the patients, 265 (52.3%) underwent early cholecystectomy, defined as surgery during the index admission, while 242 (47.7%) underwent delayed cholecystectomy, defined as postdischarge cholecystectomy or if cholecystectomy was not performed.

Overall, biliary complications occurred in as many as 23% of those who had delayed cholecystectomy compared with just 0.8% among those having the early cholecystectomy (P < .001).

Of patients who had delayed cholecystectomy and developed complications, 15.5% did so within 3 months, 6.5% by 6 months, and 1% by 12 months.

Among those who had ERCP with sphincterotomy, there were no significant differences in rates of biliary complications vs those who did not have sphincterotomy (26% vs 21%; P = .74), while stenting also did not reduce the risk (25% vs 27%; P = .81).

The leading reasons for delayed cholecystectomy included patients having a high surgical risk (27.3%), concurrent biliary pathology (19.2%), and physician preference (14%).

The findings underscore that “concurrent cholecystectomy is associated with the lowest risk of biliary complications,” El Halabi said.

“Delayed cholecystectomy is associated with an approximately 23% incidence of biliary complications with 1 year of initial admission, with the highest incidence occurring within 3 months,” she added. “Neither sphincterotomy nor stenting during ERCP mitigates this risk.”

“Early cholecystectomy during the index admission remains the most reliable strategy to reduce recurrent events.”

Commenting on the study, Luis F. Lara, MD, division chief of Digestive Diseases at the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, who co-moderated the session, agreed that evidence soundly supports early cholecystectomy.

“We also did a large study looking at this and there's no doubt that doing it during the index admission has a tremendous effect on long-term outcomes,” Lara told Medscape Medical News.

Lara noted that “part of it is people don't show up again until they get sick again, so we don't want to lose that opportunity the first time, during the index admission,” he said.

Lara's previous studies have specifically documented how early cholecystectomy for acute biliary pancreatitis improves outcomes of hospitalization for cirrhosis and factors associated with early unplanned readmissions following same-admission cholecystectomy for acute biliary pancreatitis.

Akwi W. Asombang, MD, an interventional gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, both in Boston, agreed that the findings are important.

“We know that if a cholecystectomy is not performed in the same admission as ERCP, the stones in the gallbladder remain and may migrate out into the bile duct, resulting in further complications as described in the study,” Asombang, also a session co-moderator, told Medscape Medical News.

She noted that the practice can vary between institutions based on factors including the availability of physicians to perform the cholecystectomy.

Potential complications in delaying the procedure can range from inflammation and pancreatitis to obstruction of the bile duct, “which then can result in cholangitis and eventually sepsis or even death,” Asombang cautioned.

“So the timing of the procedure with ERCP is definitely significant,” she said.

El Halabi and Asombang had no disclosures to report. Lara reported a relationship with AbbVie.

Brensocatib, newly approved by the FDA for noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB), was also associated with improvements in lung structure, on the basis of data from a substudy of 100 individuals from the trial that supported the approval. The findings were presented at the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) 2025 Annual Meeting.

The drug was approved by the FDA in August 2025 in 10-mg and 25-mg oral doses for adults and children aged 12 years or older, according to a press release from manufacturer Insmed. Brensocatib, an inhibitor of DPP-1, is designed to target the distinctive chronic airway inflammation associated with NCFB.

Brensocatib has been shown to reduce the risk for pulmonary exacerbations, and the researchers explored whether it could also affect disease progression as measured by changes on the CT scan, said lead author James D. Chalmers, MD, of the University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, in an interview. “Patients and clinicians worry about disease progression, and a treatment that could prevent disease progression would be important,” said Chalmers, who presented the findings at the meeting.

In the ASPEN phase 3 trial, once-daily brensocatib significantly reduced pulmonary exacerbations, extended the time to the first exacerbation, and increased patients' odds of staying exacerbation-free over a 1-year follow-up compared with placebo.

In the new study, the researchers examined the effect of brensocatib on structural lung disease. They reviewed CT scans from 100 adults from the ASPEN trial including 37 who received 10 mg of brensocatib, 24 who received 25 mg of brensocatib, and 39 who received a placebo. CT scans were analyzed at baseline and after 52 weeks using the Bronchiectasis Scoring Technique for CT (BEST-CT) and the LungQ-BA.

Specifically, a 25-mg dose of brensocatib was associated with significant reductions in BEST-CT subscores of bronchiectasis with mucus plugging and mucus plugging overall (P = .0084 and P = .0154, respectively), as well as increased healthy tissue (parenchyma) compared with placebo at 52 weeks.

On the LungQ-BA, patients who received 25 mg of brensocatib showed significantly fewer bronchus artery pairs (a measure of improved bronchial wall thickness) than those who received placebo at 52 weeks (P = .0499). Additionally, the bronchus outer diameter measures were significantly smaller for patients who received 10 mg of brensocatib than for those who received placebo.

Despite the moderate sample size, the researchers saw significant reductions in mucus in patients receiving brensocatib, particularly the 25-mg dose, and an overall increase in healthy parenchyma, Chalmers told Medscape Medical News. “This suggests that brensocatib has an effect on mucus that is downstream of its anti-inflammatory activity and could have important implications for future treatment,” he added.

“My personal opinion is that along with the lung function benefit seen with the 25-mg dose of brensocatib, the data support using the 25-mg first line, although both 25-mg and 10-mg doses were approved by the FDA,” said Chalmers. The new data also show that patients with considerable mucus plugging or those at a high risk for disease progression may benefit from brensocatib, which is important as the clinical community considers which patients to prioritize for treatment, he said.

The major study limitation was the small sample size of 100 in relation to the overall trial size of more than 1700 patients, Chalmers said. In addition, the methods used to assess CT changes vary, although the BEST-CT was validated in the European Bronchiectasis Registry (EMBARC) and appeared robust, he noted.

The new study of imaging signals adds weight to brensocatib's value as an evidence-based option for patients with NCFB who have frequent exacerbations or progressive lung function decline, said Daniel A. Salerno, MD, professor of clinical thoracic medicine & surgery at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, in an interview.

The data complement the clinical outcomes from the ASPEN program, said Salerno, who was not involved in the study.

“The parent ASPEN trial showed fewer exacerbations, slower lung function decline, and symptom improvements; the CT substudy reports reductions in mucus plugging and some measures of bronchial wall/airway disease over 52 weeks, suggesting brensocatib's anti-inflammatory effects may translate into actual, if modest, structural change on imaging,” said Salerno.

“Those imaging signals strengthen the argument that brensocatib can be disease-modifying for noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, an important point now that brensocatib (Brinsupri) has regulatory approval,” he noted.

In bronchiectasis, structural changes on CT are usually hard to demonstrate over a single year because structural disease is often considered slowly progressive, Salerno told Medscape Medical News. The nominally significant reductions in percent mucus plugging and the small improvements in percent healthy parenchyma, as well as in artificial intelligence-derived airway measures, represent a meaningful signal that supports a possible effect on disease biology beyond symptom control, he said. “However, the effects were modest and exploratory, with nominal P values, so they should be viewed as hypothesis generating rather than definitive,” he added.

In practice, “expect the largest and clearest benefits in patients with neutrophilic inflammation and prior exacerbations (the main ASPEN population), and consider brensocatib for adults and adolescents (as per the drug label) with frequent exacerbations despite guideline airway clearance and antibiotic strategies,” said Salerno. However, issues of cost, access, and payer coverage will influence real-world uptake, he noted.

Key limitations include the small sample size and the use of multiple comparisons that yielded nominal P values, Salerno said. Also, the BEST-CT scoring system is visual and semi-quantitative and therefore subject to reader variability, although this was mitigated somewhat by the inclusion of the LungQ-BA, he added.

Next steps for research include larger, prospectively planned imaging cohorts or all-trial imaging, with prespecified endpoints and multiplicity control to confirm and quantify structural benefits, Salerno told Medscape Medical News. Other areas for research include longer follow-up periods and phenotype analysis to identify which patients benefit most, he said. Real-world safety and effectiveness data, including cost-effectiveness and adherence, also will be needed after the drug's rollout, he said.

The study was supported by brensocatib manufacturer Insmed, and Chalmers disclosed receiving consulting and grant income from Insmed.

Salerno disclosed having no financial conflicts of interest.

Chronic pain of any type affected 40% of patients after traumatic brain injury (TBI), with bodily pain occurring more frequently than headache, new research showed. Additionally, risk for chronic pain was nearly eightfold higher in patients with preinjury migraine and nearly twofold higher in women and those with psychosocial distress.

“Chronic pain prevalence post-TBI is clinically relevant, with ~50% experiencing bodily pain and ~30% experiencing headache. These rates generally remained consistent long-term and between civilian and military populations,” the investigators of the study wrote.

“Potentially modifiable symptoms and psychosocial factors should be included in future prognostic studies alongside work to determine the best approaches in screening for those at risk, and how to manage those with chronic pain,” they added.

The study was led by Christopher Papic, PhD, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. It was published online on October 21 in PAIN.

The study was limited by its predominant reliance on data from North America, restricting its generalizability to other regions. The pain-focused search strategy may have missed headache-specific studies, and incomplete reporting on the bodily pain subdomain of SF-36 constrained the analysis. Sports-related studies were excluded because they mainly included cases of mild TBI that did not meet the study's inclusion criteria.

The investigators reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

The Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management-Uniting Providers (TEAM-UP) program, which involved preventive medication for asthma and telemedicine visits with specialists, increased the number of symptom-free days and reduced school absenteeism in children with moderate-to-severe asthma. The program also showed promise in reducing emergency visits and hospitalizations.

“This program could serve as a model for the care of children with asthma in communities that are under-resourced,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Jill S. Halterman, MD, MPH, of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in Rochester, New York. It was published online on October 23, 2025, in The Journal of Pediatrics.

The study was conducted in a single urban school district. The reliance on an existing school-based telemedicine program may limit the applicability of the intervention in other settings. Caregiver-reported outcomes may introduce potential recall bias.

The study did not report receiving any funding. Various authors disclosed receiving speaking, lecture fees, and grants from various pharmaceutical companies, including GSK, Sanofi, and Takeda.

BARCELONA, Spain — A new randomized trial of embolization of the middle meningeal artery (EMMA) following surgery for chronic subdural hematoma showed striking results, with a major drop in hematoma recurrence.

In the EMMA-CAN trial, patients who underwent the embolization procedure were six times less likely to experience symptomatic hematoma recurrence during the 90-day follow-up period.

“These new data confirm the effectiveness of this embolization procedure for routine care of subdural hematoma. We hope that this procedure will now be adopted more widely across the world, which should transform the care of chronic subdural hematoma patients,” lead investigator Jai Shankar, MD, professor of radiology at the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, told Medscape Medical News.

The results were presented on October 24 at the 17th World Stroke Congress (WSC) 2025.

Treatment of chronic subdural hematoma is the most common procedure conducted by neurosurgeons, Shankar noted.

The condition is caused by slow accumulation of blood leaking out of vessels onto the surface of the brain, often following mild head injury.

Chronic subdural hematoma affects an estimated 300 people per million, with incidence rising sharply with age. About half of these patients are surgical candidates; the rest either have milder disease or comorbidities that rule out surgery.

While surgery is usually effective in draining the hematoma, recurrence occurs in roughly one third of patients. “This is a major problem,” Shankar said.

EMMA is an endovascular procedure that blocks blood flow to the fragile membranes surrounding the hematoma. It is being studied both as an adjunct to surgery and as an alternative for patients who are not surgical candidates.

The investigator-initiated EMMA-CAN trial focused on the use of this technique to reduce hematoma recurrence in patients who had already had surgery.

Shankar explained that the embolization procedure is a minimally invasive endovascular technique in which a catheter is guided into the middle meningeal artery — the vessel supplying the membrane that sustains the hematoma — and a liquid embolic agent is injected to seal the bleeding membrane.

The procedure takes roughly 45 minutes to an hour and is usually performed under general anesthesia.

In the EMMA-CAN trial, 192 patients were randomly assigned to receive the EMMA procedure, using a liquid embolic agent (Onyx 18), within 72 hours of surgical drainage or to standard surgical care with no embolization.

Results showed that in those who received the EMMA procedure, there was a large reduction in symptomatic recurrence of hematoma at 90 days compared with surgery alone.

Symptomatic recurrence of hematoma occurred in 28% of the control group vs 4.3% of those who received the EMMA procedure (odds ratio [OR], 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03-0.31; P < .001).

Radiographic hematoma recurrence occurred in 49.5% of the control group compared with 14% of the EMMA group (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.08-0.33; P < .001). This benefit was achieved without an increase in serious adverse events, and mortality rates were similar between the study arms.

There have been four recent trials of EMMA for the treatment of subdural hematoma, with two showing positive results and two neutral, Shankar noted.

He said this new trial is the most methodologically rigorous to date and provides the strongest evidence in support of the EMMA procedure. In particular, he said, it was notable that the surgeons performing the initial surgery were blinded to whether these patients would also undergo embolization.

“In randomized trials, blinding is very important. If a surgeon knows that the patient is going to get EMMA, they may not be as rigorous in the initial surgical drainage. This can dilute the effect size,” said Shankar.

He noted that the EMMA-CAN trial clearly defined treatment timing and included only patients who had undergone surgery for unilateral hematoma. He also highlighted the study's excellent retention, with only one patient lost to follow-up.

“We wanted to keep methodology very precise,” Shankar said. “As a result, our trial was much more rigorously controlled for all these variables, which is why I believe we showed a stronger result.”

He believes that these results will settle any uncertainty about the use of EMMA after surgery.

“It tips the balance toward better outcomes for these patients when they get the embolization procedure.”

To further examine the effects of the EMMA procedure, investigators from all the trials are collaborating on a meta-analysis of the combined results.

While the current results do not apply to patients who have not had surgery, Shankar said there is no reason to believe that the procedure would not work in this population because the pathologic mechanism of subdural hematoma is the same.

He added that the EMMA-CAN trial included a registry of patients who were ineligible for randomization, and preliminary findings from that group suggest that they may also benefit from the procedure.

“I think we have enough data now to show that the procedure is effective. We now need to enable it to be rolled out more extensively. This involves building up endovascular capacity, standardizing the protocol, and ensuring reimbursement so that every patient that could benefit actually gets access to this procedure,” Shankar said.

Commenting on the trial results for Medscape Medical News, Marc Fisher, MD, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, Boston, said the results confirm previous evidence of benefit with the embolization procedure for patients with chronic subdural hematoma.

He explained that the middle meningeal artery is the major blood supply to the area where the bleeding occurs, and the embolization process cuts off the blood supply to the hematoma, reducing its growth.

“This embolization procedure is being incorporated into practice now, and this trial should further encourage that,” he added.

The EMMA-CAN trial was sponsored by the University of Manitoba and funded by Medtronic. Shankar reported receiving research funding from Medtronic.

CHICAGO — Positive phase 3 trials for two drugs, telitacicept and ianalumab, showed promise for offering systemic treatment for Sjögren disease, rather than only symptom control.

Findings of both abstracts were presented at American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2025 Annual Meeting.

Telitacicept is a novel fusion protein that targets and neutralizes BlyS (a B-lymphocyte stimulator) and APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand), whereas ianalumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that depletes B cells through enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and inhibits their activation and survival by blocking the B cell-activating factor receptor.

“They both show significant improvement” and “appear safe and effective,” Shailendra Singh, MD, a rheumatologist with Unity Health in Searcy, Arkansas, told Medscape Medical News. Singh, who was not part of either study, pointed out that telitacicept achieved its primary endpoint of change in European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) Sjögren Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) from baseline to 24 weeks while ianalumab achieved its primary endpoint of change in ESSDAI from baseline to 48 weeks.

These two drugs are among many in development, Singh said. “I'm happy that there has been an increased interest in treatment options. With new treatments we will be able to improve the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. Plus, if we are keeping inflammation under control, we are reducing the risk of lymphoma. Hopefully that's the direction we are moving in.”

In the telitacicept study, a total of 381 patients in China with active, anti-Sjögren syndrome-related antigen A-positive primary Sjögren disease were randomly assigned to get weekly injections of the biologic at 80 or 160 mg or placebo. Compared with placebo, both telitacicept 160 mg and 80 mg demonstrated consistent clinical symptom improvement through 48 weeks and mild side effects.

Greater improvements on the ESSDAI were seen with the telitacicept 160 mg dose. Researchers found that 71.8% of patients receiving the 160 mg dose had a ESSDAI reduction of least 3 points at 24 weeks compared with 19.3% of patients receiving placebo.

At week 24, the ESSDAI improved with a reduction of -4.4 with the 160-mg dose, -3.0 with 80 mg, and -0.6 with placebo. Improvement in ESSDAI at week 48 was -4.6 with 160 mg, -3.2 with 80 mg, and -0.4 with placebo.

The study author who presented the results, Lin Qiao, MD, of the Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China, told Medscape Medical News this was the first trial for a systemic treatment to reach phase 3 in China.

The trial also met all key secondary endpoints, including changes in ESSDAI and EULAR Sjögren Syndrome Patient Reported Index at 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks. The telitacicept 160-mg dose reached highly significant P values (P < .0001) for every endpoint at week 24 and 48 compared with placebo.

Adverse reactions were “very mild,” Lin said, “such as respiratory infections and some injection site reactions. We did not find any new adverse events” since the phase 2 trial, she said.

Two complementary phase 3 trials, called NEPTUNUS-1and NEPTUNUS-2, showed the safety and efficacy of ianalumab. They were 52-week, global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.

“NEPTUNUS-1 and NEPTUNUS-2 are the first global, replicate phase 3 studies in Sjögren's to meet their primary objective, showing a statistically significant improvement in ESSDAI,” said Thomas Grader-Beck, MD, associate professor of clinical medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, who presented the results of the two trials in a late-breaking abstracts session. “The safety of ianalumab was favorable overall. Incidence of adverse effects and serious adverse effects were comparable to placebo in both studies.”

The primary endpoint was ESSDAI change from baseline at week 48 for ianalumab compared with placebo and it was met in both trials.

In the NEPTUNUS-1 trial of 275 patients who were randomly assigned to a subcutaneous injection of 300 mg ianalumab once monthly or placebo, the ianalumab group saw an ESSDAI score drop of -6.4 from baseline compared with a drop of -5.1 for the placebo group (P = .0496).

In NEPTUNUS-2 trial of 504 patients who were randomly assigned to a subcutaneous injection of 300 mg ianalumab once monthly or once every 3 months or placebo, the once-monthly ianalumab group averaged an ESSDAI score drop of -6.5 compared with -5.5 in the placebo group (P = .041). The ESSDAI score dropped -6.0 in the group that received ianalumab every 3 months, which was not statistically different from placebo.

The phase 3 trial of telitacicept was sponsored by RemeGen. Lin reported no relevant financial relationships, but several coauthors are employees of RemeGen.

NEPTUNUS-1 and NEPTUNUS-2 were sponsored by Novartis.

Grader-Beck reported being a consultant and steering board member with Novartis. Some coauthors are employees of Novartis, and others reported financial relationships with Novartis and other pharmaceutical companies.

Singh reported no relevant financial relationships.

Long-term use of melatonin supplements, often used to promote sleep and address insomnia, was associated with a higher risk of heart failure diagnosis, heart failure hospitalization and death from any cause in chronic insomnia, according to a preliminary study to be presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting, Nov. 7-10, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science.

Melatonin is a hormone naturally produced in the body by the pineal gland, and it helps regulate the body's sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin levels increase during darkness and decrease during daylight. Chemically identical synthetic versions of the hormone are often used to treat insomnia (difficulty falling and/or staying asleep) and jet lag. The supplements are widely available over the counter in many countries, including the U.S. In the U.S., over-the-counter supplements are not regulated, so each brand of supplement can vary in strength, purity, etc.

In this study, researchers classified people who had used melatonin long-term (with long-term use defined as a year or more documented in their electronic health records) as part of the ""melatonin group."" In contrast, those who never had melatonin recorded anywhere in their medical records were classified as the ""non-melatonin group.""

Melatonin supplements may not be as harmless as commonly assumed. If our study is confirmed, this could affect how doctors counsel patients about sleep aids.""

Ekenedilichukwu Nnadi, M.D., lead author of the study and chief resident in internal medicine at SUNY Downstate/Kings County Primary Care in Brooklyn, New York

Melatonin supplements are promoted and marketed as a safe sleep aid; however, data demonstrating their long-term cardiovascular safety are lacking, which prompted the researchers to examine whether melatonin use alters the risk of heart failure, specifically in chronic insomnia patients. According to the American Heart Association's 2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics, heart failure occurs when the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs for them to function properly and is a common condition that affects 6.7 million adults in the U.S.

Using a large international database (the TriNetX Global Research Network), the researchers reviewed 5 years of electronic health records for adults with chronic insomnia who had melatonin recorded in their health records and used it for more than a year. They were matched with peers in the database who also had insomnia but never had melatonin recorded in their health records. People were excluded from the analysis if they had previously been diagnosed with heart failure or had been prescribed other sleep medications.

The main analysis found:

A secondary analysis found:

""Melatonin supplements are widely thought of as a safe and 'natural' option to support better sleep, so it was striking to see such consistent and significant increases in serious health outcomes, even after balancing for many other risk factors,"" Nnadi said.

""I'm surprised that physicians would prescribe melatonin for insomnia and have patients use it for more than 365 days, since melatonin, at least in the U.S., is not indicated for the treatment of insomnia. In the U.S., melatonin can be taken as an over-the-counter supplement and people should be aware that it should not be taken chronically without a proper indication,"" said Marie-Pierre St-Onge, Ph.D., C.C.S.H., FAHA, chair of the writing group for the American Heart Association's 2025 scientific statement, Multidimensional Sleep Health: Definitions and Implications for Cardiometabolic Health. St-Onge, who was not involved in this study, is a professor of nutritional medicine in the division of general medicine and director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep & Circadian Research in the department of medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.

The study has several limitations. First, the database includes countries that require a prescription for melatonin (such as the United Kingdom) and countries that don't (such as the United States), and patient locations were not part of the de-identified data available to the researchers. Since melatonin use in the study was based only on those identified from medication entries in the electronic health record, everyone taking it as an over-the-counter supplement in the U.S. or other countries that don't require a prescription would have been in the non-melatonin group; therefore, the analyses may not accurately reflect this. Hospitalization figures were also higher than those for initial diagnosis of heart failure because a range of related diagnostic codes may be entered for the hospitalization, and they may not always include the code for a new diagnosis of heart failure. The researchers also lacked information on the severity of insomnia and the presence of other psychiatric disorders.

""Worse insomnia, depression/anxiety or the use of other sleep-enhancing medicines might be linked to both melatonin use and heart risk,"" Nnadi said. ""Also, while the association we found raises safety concerns about the widely used supplement, our study cannot prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship. This means more research is needed to test melatonin's safety for the heart.""

Once reserved for emperors, black rice is making a comeback as a natural way to boost antioxidants, support metabolism, and power a new generation of healthy, plant-based foods.



Review: Black rice as the emerging functional food: bioactive compounds, therapeutic potential and industrial applications. Image Credit: Peter Hermes Furian / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, researchers reviewed the health benefits, industrial applications, and therapeutic potential of black rice (Oryza sativa L.).

About half of the global population relies on rice as a basic food source. Rice is cultivated in more than 100 countries and serves as the primary staple food in at least 15 countries in the Pacific and Asia, 10 countries in the Caribbean and Latin America, and one country in North Africa, as well as in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, nearly two billion people derive 60 to 70% of their daily caloric intake from rice.

Black rice, also known as forbidden rice, purple rice, imperial rice, and paradise rice, is rich in micronutrients and antioxidants, with anthocyanin levels exceeding those in blueberries. The need for better food options to support the growing population has been a key factor driving demand for plant-based foods. In the present study, researchers summarized the health benefits, industrial applications, and therapeutic potential of black rice.

Black rice bran comprises more than 80% of the bioactive compounds, and studies have reported that the bran is responsible for the nutritional benefits of black rice. Nutritional analyses have shown that, in addition to macronutrients, black rice contains essential amino acids (e.g., tryptophan and lysine), minerals, and vitamins. Its lipid composition is characterized by approximately 36% oleic acid, 34% linoleic acid, and 20% palmitic acid.

Black rice contains substantial amounts of zinc, selenium, and iron, which are essential for the functioning of antioxidant enzymes. It also contains B-complex vitamins, vitamin E, and β-carotene. Phenolic compounds in black rice include quercetin, ferulic acid, rutin, syringic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Furthermore, tocopherols and γ-oryzanol are abundant in the bran, with γ-oryzanol concentrations estimated at approximately 100 to 200 mg/kg. Germination also increases γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, further enhancing the nutritional value of black rice.

The antidiabetic effects of black rice have been attributed to the inhibition of carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes and suppression of intestinal glucose transporters, which alleviate postprandial glucose spikes. Resistant starch in black rice amplifies these effects by enhancing insulin sensitivity and decelerating carbohydrate digestion. Studies have reported improvements in glucose homeostasis in rats with diabetes following the administration of black rice extracts (BRE).

Furthermore, anthocyanins in black rice have been found to enhance fecal sterol excretion and inhibit cholesterol absorption, resulting in approximately a 22% decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in animal models. Studies on rats have reported that cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), an anthocyanin found in black rice, enhances superoxide dismutase activity, inhibits lipid peroxidation, and induces a hypoglycemic effect. However, the review notes that anthocyanin bioavailability in humans is generally low, which may limit the translation of these effects to clinical outcomes.

Anthocyanin fractions from black rice bran were found to protect neuronal cells from endoplasmic and oxidative stress induced by amyloid-beta. One study reported that anthocyanins mitigated cytokine storms caused by the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in lung cell models. The anti-metastatic properties of C3G and peonidin-3-glucoside, the two primary anthocyanins in black rice, have also been well documented.

Black rice processing influences the degradation or preservation of its bioactive compounds. A comprehensive metabolomics study examined the changes in metabolites in black rice following germination, milling, and exposure to high pressure and temperature. It noted that germination increased γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), phenolic compounds, and γ-oryzanol, while milling reduced anthocyanins and phenolic compounds.

Conversely, pressure heat treatment was linked to microbiological safety. Other studies have found that approximately 4% polishing during milling reduces anthocyanin content by 50-90%. Furthermore, post-harvest sprouting, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and fermentation may partially increase the levels of bioactive compounds. Enzymatic acylation was found to enhance antioxidant capacity and stabilize anthocyanin levels in black rice.

Incorporating anthocyanin-enriched BRE into the coatings of extruded snacks can prolong their shelf life. Using black rice flour instead of wheat flour for bread baking has been reported to decrease glycemic index and enhance antioxidant capacity. Similarly, using black rice flour in pasta increases the dietary fiber content and reduces the glycemic index, while incorporating it into noodles diminishes oil absorption during frying.

Taken together, black rice is a culturally significant, nutrient-dense functional food that contains substantial levels of minerals, anthocyanins, dietary fiber, phenolic compounds, and resistant starch. These compounds show potential to help regulate blood sugar levels, enhance brain function and heart health, and reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the human clinical evidence remains limited and mixed, with some short-duration trials showing benefits to body composition and others reporting no changes in lipid levels, indicating the need for adequately powered, longer-term, standardized, randomized controlled trials before drawing firm conclusions.

The authors also highlight practical challenges, including low crop yield, high production costs, and water-intensive cultivation, which must be addressed to ensure sustainable scaling of black rice as a functional food crop. Black rice is also an excellent ingredient in the food industry, including beverages, functional and gluten-free snacks, baked foods, and colorants.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","States make progress in removing barriers to opioid use disorder medications","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251103/States-make-progress-in-removing-barriers-to-opioid-use-disorder-medications.aspx","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 16:20:00 GMT","

A new study from Tulane University found that, over the past decade, more states have moved to make it easier for people with opioid use disorder to get potentially life-saving medication.

The study published in Health Affairs found that, as of 2023, 22 states have passed laws prohibiting private insurance plans from requiring prior authorization, a process that requires doctors to get insurer approval before prescribing certain medications for opioid use disorder. That's an increase from only two states in 2015.

This signals a positive trend that states are taking legislative efforts to address the opioid crisis. Prior authorization is a major barrier to care and removing it helps patients start treatment faster.""

Allison Ju-Chen Hu, lead author, assistant professor of health policy and management at the Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University

The study analyzed state laws from 2015 to 2023 and focused on private insurance since those with private coverage are more likely to encounter prior authorization than those enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid. More than one-third of people with opioid use disorder are covered by private insurance.

Medications for opioid use disorder include methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone. If prior authorization is denied by an insurer, a doctor can still provide the medication, but the patient must pay out of pocket or go without treatment.

""Having coverage doesn't necessarily guarantee access to needed medications,"" Hu said.

While seven states fully banned prior authorization for all medications for opioid use disorder, 15 others enacted partial bans that still allow it in some cases, such as for specific drug types or prescription lengths. Four of those states - New York, Arkansas, Colorado and Missouri - later strengthened their laws to eliminate those restrictions.

Hu said the trend reflected growing awareness of the opioid crisis among both the public and state legislators, and that even partial prior authorization prohibitions can potentially serve as footholds for larger reform.

The study also found that eight states extended the scope of their prior authorization prohibitions to naloxone, a medication that reverses opioid overdoses.

Since 2023, naloxone has been available over the counter, though the out-of-pocket cost was much lower with insurance.

Approximately 80,000 Americans died from drug overdoses involving opioids in 2023. Hu hopes the findings of this legal analysis lay the groundwork for future studies evaluating the impact of prior authorization bans, insurer compliance, access to medications for opioid use disorder and treatment outcomes.

""With proper enforcement, patients in these states should face fewer delays and have an easier time getting the medications they need,"" Hu said. ""Future research should examine how well these laws are working in practice and whether they're helping more people stay in treatment.""

Many young people who suffered sudden cardiac death had recently sought medical care. More frequent use of electrocardiograms (ECG) could help prevent such cases, according to researchers at the University of Gothenburg.

Sudden cardiac death without visible heart disease - known as sudden arrhythmic death- can strike even young, seemingly healthy individuals. It is, however, very rare: about 15 cases occur each year in Sweden.

In this Swedish nationwide study, researchers examined all cases of sudden arrhythmic death among individuals aged 1 to 35 who died in Sweden between 2000 and 2010. Many of those who died had shown signs of heart problems before their deaths.

The study identified 149 deaths over the ten-year period in which autopsies found no structural damage to the heart- indicating an electrical disturbance in the heart rhythm. Using Sweden's national health and population registers along with medical records, the researchers analyzed symptoms, ECG results, and healthcare visits prior to death. Each case was compared with ten randomly selected individuals from the Swedish population, matched by age, sex, and county of residence.

Key findings:
• Most of the victims were young men in their early twenties.
• Half had shown early warning signs such as fainting or palpitations.
• One in three had sought medical care within six months of death. Among these, visits for fainting were twenty times more common and visits for seizures ten times more common than among controls.
• Nearly one in five had a previously abnormal ECG.

The study was conducted by Matilda Frisk Torell, researcher affiliated with the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg and cardiologist at Sahlgrenska University Hospital.

""It's striking that so many had seen a doctor shortly before the event. It shows that we have an opportunity to identify those at risk before something happens,"" says Matilda Frisk Torell.

The results indicate that fainting, seizures, and abnormal ECG findings in young people should be taken more seriously.

The more we understand the symptoms and ECG changes that may come before a sudden arrhythmic death, the better we can identify those at risk.""

With over 150,000 new materials developed by the Materials Project computers, Berkeley Lab, headquartered in California, could not synthesize these novel materials quickly enough to evaluate them for real-world applications. 

To overcome this, Berkeley Lab partnered with Labman to develop a fully customized system to synthesize the materials in an automated, twenty four hour a day operation pattern, guided by AI predictions for successful synthesis conditions and material composition.

Labman technology has made a significant difference to this project. The system can now synthesize the novel materials in a safe and repeatable way in under an hour, a process that would have previously required about a day to achieve.

Throughput was 100 times higher than that of manual material synthesis. 40 novel predicted compounds were produced in the first month, marking a significant advancement relative to traditional manual methods.

Labman's clients are at the forefront of numerous areas of scientific research, especially in material science and formulation. For the researchers at Berkeley Lab (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), manually synthesizing 150,000 novel AI-predicted materials presented a challenging task.

With automation rapidly becoming an integral part of advanced laboratories worldwide, the research team turned to Labman to create a fully customized solution for their predicament.

Using its extensive experience in handling diverse powders, liquid dispensing, formulation, and synthesis, Labman developed a high-throughput, powerful system to fulfill the project's strict requirements.

The LBC system, based around a 6-axis robotic arm and equipped with a ‘hotel' of dispensers handling more than 200 different powder-based materials, is ideal for creating distinct formulations. Labman's mechanical, electrical, and software engineers collaborated closely with the Berkeley Lab team to thoroughly understand the required process and ensure that it elevated their workflow.

“The Labman team has been tremendously supportive and responsive throughout the whole project. I am grateful to work with Matt, Olly, Nick, and other team members at Labman to make and deliver our LBCS robot,” stated Yan Zeng, a materials scientist who led Berkeley Lab's team on the project.

“Labman has an open-minded attitude and great creativity with these talented and kind team members that I have not seen from another company,” he said.

After system commissioning and initial testing were completed, Berkeley Lab researchers began processing the 150,000 proposed formulations for new materials listed by their systems. With speed and efficiency as core motivations behind the technology, the team was satisfied with the system's performance and the resulting materials created.

I have made more new compounds in the last six weeks than my whole career.

The AI-optimized BALANCE (Bioreactor Automation for Learning and Adaptive Networked Control of Experiments) platform combines the skills of CPI (UK), Basetwo (Canada), Nicoya (Canada), and Labman Automation (UK). The project is funded by a $2 million grant provided by Innovate UK and the National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC IRAP).

The core focus of this 20-month collaboration is to develop a demonstrator platform combining smart bioreactor technologies, real-time sensing, AI-driven optimization, and sophisticated modular automation. Labman will design and construct a fully automated modular sampling system to enable the molecular analysis of cell cultures with minimal manual intervention.

This system will integrate seamlessly with Nicoya's Alto SPR biosensor, providing instant feedback on yield and quality to enable real-time adaptive control of the process.

The BALANCE system employs Basetwo's digital twin technology, a machine learning system that analyzes real-time data from biosensors and bioreactors to make informed decisions about process conditions. This closed-loop control system allows for ongoing optimization, predicting outcomes, and minimizing the need for expensive laboratory-based experiments.

This is the next step for biologics and drug manufacturing, integrating Industry 4.0 approaches for bioprocessing. By combining advanced sensing, AI and automation, we aim to accelerate process development, improve consistency, and create smarter, more efficient biomanufacturing workflows.

Tom Smith, Head of Bioprocess Automation, Labman

The project's goal is to boost yield, scalability, and speed to market for biologic therapeutics by streamlining upstream bioprocessing and enabling dynamic control. CPI will lead system validation to ensure that the platform is technically durable, scalable, and commercially viable.

This collaboration represents a significant advancement in the digitization of biologics fabrication. For Labman, it is another opportunity to show how intelligent, adaptive automation can revolutionize complex scientific processes.

Using TIDAS, the Energy Materials Group at the University of Birmingham has increased productivity in fabricating electrode coatings and cells.

The Energy Materials Group at the University of Birmingham required a probe of agglomerate size to support their fabrication studies. Determining agglomerate size in battery electrode slurries poses a significant challenge due to their high opacity. This opacity limits light scattering techniques, which usually require heavy dilution of the slurry, potentially affecting its structure.

Labman's TIDAS provides the research team with an early measure of agglomerate size within the slurry. This is especially advantageous as it prevents the trialing of uncoatable slurries during battery manufacturing and delivers valuable insights into particle dispersion levels. Poorly dispersed slurries can restrict cell capacity and battery lifespan.

TIDAS has enhanced efficiency for The Energy Materials Group, providing a key tool to objectively characterize battery electrode slurries at early production stages. This prevents hours, or even days of wasted time trialing unsuitable slurries and systematically records data for exceptional traceability.

At the University of Birmingham's School of Metallurgy and Materials, scientists are investigating the complete lifecycle of battery materials, from raw material sourcing and selection to manufacturing, performance, and end-of-life recycling. Within this cycle, manufacturing studies play a critical role.

A persistent obstacle involves ensuring slurry mixtures are of high quality, a factor fundamental to effective electrode coating and consistent battery performance. The high opacity of these slurries makes agglomerate size measurement especially challenging when using traditional methods.

Historically, the research team has relied on the manual Hegman gauge test to evaluate slurry quality. However, this approach suffered from poor reproducibility and subjective interpretation of results. Because the slurries are opaque, results were highly inconsistent between users. Meaningful data extraction was restricted to visual breakthrough points, an inadequate metric for research-grade quality control.

To support their manufacturing research, the team required an agglomerate-size probe. TIDAS is the only instrument on the market capable of reproducibly taking readings from completely opaque samples through dark field illumination techniques, thus enhancing the team's suite of slurry characterization metrology.

The TIDAS system provides an early indication of whether a slurry is suitable for coating and sufficiently well-dispersed to prevent later issues, such as reduced cell capacity. Since its implementation, the system has delivered substantial time and material savings.

Early detection of an uncoatable slurry (where particle size is too large for calendaring) saves approximately one hour in wasted coating trials. However, the most significant advantage comes from early identification of poorly dispersed slurries where particles are not mixed well or contain agglomerates.

If a slurry that has agglomeration issues is detected early, this saves us up to two hours coating, three hours cell making, and then testing. During testing, issues can take up to one week to show up, so TIDAS prevents significant time wastage.

Carl Reynolds, Researcher, University of Birmingham

In addition to time savings, the laboratory benefits from reduced material waste, preventing unnecessary use of foils, cell casings, and electrolytes. The system also frees up equipment and researcher time by preventing repeat experiments.

The TIDAS system has proven particularly advantageous across various ongoing research areas. In trials investigating water-based biopolymer binders in electrode formulations, the system provides a critical first check on slurry consistency before full testing begins.

It has also allowed scientists to confidently work on 3D-printed electrode coatings, where the slurry's agglomerate size must be smaller than the nozzle opening to avoid blockages. In addition, TIDAS has strengthened the group's contribution to the Faraday Institution's NEXTRODE project, supporting novel metrology for advanced electrode production.

Labman have been great to work with. We've used the system for several months with no downtime. Any issues we've had were quickly resolved. Harry has been especially helpful, even visiting our lab to assist with troubleshooting.

Looking forward, the research team recognizes the vast potential of this approach in industry. The ability to measure and trace slurry quality early in the production process could reduce waste during the setup of commercial coating lines. Moreover, it can help manufacturers adopt novel technologies more efficiently by addressing dispersion issues before they escalate.

A new California study reveals that “safe” levels of PFAS in tap water may still lead to elevated toxic chemicals in the bloodstream, raising new concerns about everyday exposure and regulatory limits.



Study: Associations between PFAS in public water system drinking water and serum among Southern California adults. Image Credit: Megane Ad / Shutterstock

In a recent article in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology, researchers examined blood chemical levels in adults exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) through public drinking water systems.

Their findings suggest that even in areas without industrial PFAS manufacturing, people can be significantly exposed to these “forever chemicals” through contaminated drinking water, requiring ongoing monitoring.

PFAS are man-made chemicals used for resistance to heat, stains, and water. They persist in the environment and human body, accumulating in water and living organisms due to their long half-lives.

Humans are mainly exposed through contaminated water and food. There is also exposure via skin contact, dust, or consumer products. Certain PFAS have been linked to health problems such as cancer, hormone disruption, reduced birth weight, and immune system effects.

High PFAS contamination is often found near chemical manufacturing plants or sites using firefighting foams, but low-level contamination is now widespread. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that thousands of water systems serving millions of Americans exceed newly established limits for at least one PFAS.

Although California lacks PFAS manufacturing facilities, it has contamination sources such as airports, military bases, and landfills. To address this, California's State Water Resources Control Board began monitoring PFAS in public water systems in 2019.

Most previous studies focused on areas with severe contamination, leaving uncertainty about PFAS exposure in general populations.

In this study, researchers linked biomonitoring data from Southern California adults to public water system data to assess whether PFAS in drinking water corresponded with higher PFAS levels in blood. They used data from the California Regional Exposure (CARE) study, a biomonitoring program assessing environmental chemical exposure across Eastern and Southern California.

Adults aged 18 and older who had lived in their region for at least a year provided blood and urine samples and completed questionnaires during 2018–2020. Blood samples were analyzed for 12 PFAS using advanced chromatography and mass-spectrometry methods with rigorous quality controls.

Drinking-water data were obtained from the California State Water Resources Control Board's monitoring program (2019–2022), which tested public water systems, primarily untreated source wells with some post-treatment samples, for 18 PFAS compounds. Participant addresses were geocoded and matched to specific public water system boundaries to determine whether their water supply had detectable PFAS levels at State Consumer Confidence Report Detection Limits of 2–4 ng/L (for the modeled analytes, 4 ng/L).

After excluding participants with private wells or missing data, 563 individuals were included in the final sample. Serum PFAS concentrations were compared across participants with and without PFAS detections in their local water systems, adjusting for race/ethnicity, sex, education, age, income, parity, and nativity. Additional sensitivity analyses considered the type of drinking water and water purchasing practices between systems.

Among 563 adults from Southern California, the majority of participants were middle-aged women, with nearly 40% identifying as Hispanic and 54% primarily drinking tap water.

PFAS were detected in almost all blood samples, with PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS being the most prevalent. Serum PFAS levels were generally lower than national averages but still indicated a potential for health effects in 86% of participants, according to National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) guidance.

Seventy public water systems serving the study area had PFAS testing data, and 56% of participants were connected to systems in which at least one PFAS was detected. PFBS, PFHxS, PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxA were the most frequently detected chemicals, particularly in urban Southern California.

Participants whose water systems had PFHxS detections exhibited 31.9% higher serum PFHxS concentrations, with even stronger associations when detections were frequent (≥50% of sampling locations, 64% higher).

When analysis was limited to post-treatment water samples, participants exposed to detected PFAS had significantly higher serum levels for PFHxS (~80% higher), PFOA (~30% higher), PFOS (~31% higher), and total PFAS (~42% higher). The association between drinking water and blood PFHxS was strongest among tap-water drinkers, while overall serum PFAS were lower among bottled-water drinkers, although some effect estimates for PFOS and ∑5 PFAS were approximately 20% higher but not statistically significant.

These results indicate that even relatively low PFAS levels in drinking water contribute to measurable increases in blood PFAS concentrations.

This study demonstrated that even at low environmental levels, PFAS in drinking water contribute to elevated blood concentrations, particularly for PFHxS, a compound with a long biological half-life.

Compared with national and highly contaminated regions, PFAS levels in Southern California were lower but still of health concern. The strong link between PFHxS in drinking water and serum supports previous findings and highlights the legacy of aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) contamination.

Strengths include robust linkage of biomonitoring data with statewide water-quality records and adjustment for key demographic variables. However, notable limitations included potential exposure misclassification from raw (pre-treatment) water data, the selection of larger or higher-risk systems that may bias associations upward, a temporal mismatch between some water sampling and serum collection, and a lack of information on other exposure routes (such as dust or diet).

Despite these limitations, the findings emphasize that PFAS-contaminated drinking water remains a significant exposure pathway, even in non-industrial areas, reinforcing the need for stricter PFAS regulations, expanded monitoring, and improved water treatment across California.

An international panel of leading women's mental health experts – including UVA Health's Jennifer Payne, MD – is calling to reclassify postpartum psychosis as its own category of mental illness to improve the care new mothers receive. 

Postpartum psychosis is a severe psychiatric illness that is estimated to strike up to 2.6 out of every 1,000 women after they give birth. Symptoms can include mania, depression with psychotic features, impaired thinking, agitation and irritability. Left untreated, the condition can cause women to commit suicide or kill their babies. It is considered a psychiatric emergency and often requires hospitalization.

The condition is considered one of the most easily identified mental illnesses among women because of its rapid onset and distinctive symptoms, yet it is not recognized in two key resources used for medical treatment and billing: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, often called DSM-5, or the International Classification of Disease.

Changing that, Payne and her colleagues say, will improve treatment for postpartum psychosis and ultimately save lives of both mothers and infants.

""Postpartum psychosis is a very rare and serious psychiatric illness which requires a specific treatment approach,"" said Payne, an expert in reproductive psychiatry at the University of Virginia School of Medicine and the senior author of a new ""consensus statement"" urging the change. ""Recognition of postpartum psychosis as a distinct clinical entity will promote evidence-based, safe and effective treatment.""

Payne and her collaborators, including experts from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, India and more, worked closely with patient-advocacy groups, the American Psychiatric Association and other partners to formulate the new recommendations. They note that women typically respond extremely well to existing treatments, such as lithium. These treatments are often used for bipolar disorder, formerly known as manic depression. (Women who develop postpartum psychosis have a 50-50 chance of developing bipolar disorder, while pregnant women who are already diagnosed with bipolar disorder are at extremely high risk for postpartum psychosis.)

The experts argue that postpartum psychosis does not fit into the existing categories of mental illness in the two billing and coding resources. The current descriptions only recognize ""peripartum onset,"" meaning the illness strikes during the period around childbirth. This, the authors say, incorrectly describes how postpartum psychosis can set in weeks or months after delivery.

Recategorizing the illness and detailing its symptoms will speed diagnosis and help ensure women get the care they, and their babies, need, the experts say. To facilitate diagnosis, they have proposed specific criteria, such as depression, delusions and hallucinations, to include in the treatment and coding resources.

We hope that recognition of postpartum psychosis as a distinct clinical entity will improve identification and outcomes and lead to further research to identify the underlying pathophysiology. Postpartum psychosis is treatable, and potentially preventable if we identify the underlying biological basis for the illness.""

Jennifer Payne, MD, UVA Health

The experts have published their consensus statement in the scientific journal Biological Psychiatry. The article is open access, meaning it is free to read, and includes a comprehensive review of the psychiatric literature on postpartum psychosis.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Fewer women participate in cardiac rehabilitation, despite a slew of benefits","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251103/Fewer-women-participate-in-cardiac-rehabilitation-despite-a-slew-of-benefits.aspx","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 15:04:00 GMT","

For someone who has heart surgery or experiences a major cardiovascular event, cardiac rehabilitation can significantly improve their short and long term recovery.

People who participate in this comprehensive exercise, lifestyle and education program are less likely to be readmitted to the hospital and have a lower risk of future heart attack.

Despite a slew of benefits linked to cardiac rehabilitation, attendance remains poor - with even fewer women utilizing the program.

Even when women do participate, the research tells us that they are still less likely to complete cardiac rehabilitation as compared to men. 

There are several barriers that women face to accessing cardiac rehabilitation, and existing programs may fail to adequately address their specific needs.""

Jessica Golbus, M.D., cardiologist, University of Michigan Health Frankel Cardiovascular Center

In October 2025, Golbus co-authored an American Heart Association scientific statement on cardiac rehabilitation in women.

The statement, published in Circulation, addressed benefits, barriers to access and possible solutions for increasing participation among women.

Golbus: Cardiac rehabilitation has universal benefits for anyone who participates by reducing risk factors for future cardiovascular events.

This includes lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels and improving overall quality of life.

Despite women participating in cardiac rehabilitation less than men, studies have shown that women who utilize it experience at least as much benefit as men.

There is so much research that shows how cardiac rehabilitation is an essential tool for patients to optimize their recovery.

I would encourage anyone who thinks they might be eligible for cardiac rehabilitation to talk to their clinical team and consider participating.

Golbus: There are many barriers that women face to accessing cardiac rehabilitation, and they vary widely.

First, women have lower referral rates than men for cardiac rehabilitation.

This may be due to their diagnoses or, in part, due to clinician bias.

We know that patients are much more likely to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation once they have discussed it with their clinician, and clinicians are unfortunately less likely to have that essential conversation with women.

This is even more pronounced among women from underrepresented racial groups.

Issues with insurance coverage, transportation and social isolation can also limit their participation.

Women are more often caregivers, and those responsibilities may serve as a barrier to enrollment.

Golbus: Women who have gone through major cardiovascular events may have some specific needs.

For example, both men and women with cardiovascular disease are likely to experience depression and psychosocial distress after a cardiovascular event, but this is particularly pronounced among women.

Women are also more likely to be older at the time of their heart event and to have conditions other than cardiovascular disease that may limit their ability to exercise.

Lastly, women are also more likely to be referred to cardiac rehabilitation after less common cardiovascular diagnoses such as a coronary artery dissection.

Despite women having some unique needs, the research supports that all patients that qualify for cardiac rehabilitation have the potential for benefit.

Golbus: All of this points to a clear need for targeted interventions to improve cardiac rehabilitation participation and outcomes among women.

I think the approach needs to be multi-faceted.

The easiest barrier to address is by increasing referrals for women.

Studies have shown that introducing an automatic referral process can greatly increase referrals.

Other strategies like a physician's recommendation or facilitated enrollment though a case manager have also been shown to be effective strategies for increasing awareness about cardiac rehabilitation and improving enrollment.

Cardiac rehabilitation teams might consider tailoring certain programming to women.

This could include having a broader range of exercise choices, focused education or offering more extensive psychosocial support.

Women may also benefit from a peer support group after a cardiovascular diagnosis or event.

Participating in those groups is linked to increased quality of life and lower depression and anxiety scores, which all affect cardiac rehab attendance.

Finally, there is reason to explore virtual cardiac rehab that incorporates digital health technologies.

This could eliminate the need for transportation to sessions and potentially improve access for patients who are unable to attend center-based cardiac rehabilitation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Longer distance between family physicians and patients can be potential barrier to receiving care","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251103/Longer-distance-between-family-physicians-and-patients-can-be-potential-barrier-to-receiving-care.aspx","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 13:24:00 GMT","

Living farther than 30 km from a family physician can negatively affect access to health care, found a new Ontario study published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250265.

Over the last 10 years, access to primary care has declined in Canada, and this decline accelerated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Even after moving, many patients reported continuing with their family physicians, despite travelling longer distances to reach them.

""Distance to health care services is an important determinant of health and can be classified as a factor of health care utilization, with increased distance a potential barrier to receiving care,"" writes Dr. Archna Gupta, a scientist at Upstream Lab and a family physician at St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, with coauthors.

To understand the impact of distance between family physicians and their patients on health care usage and quality of care, researchers undertook a large study based on data as of Mar. 31, 2023. The study of almost 10 million patients in Ontario, Canada's largest province, found that 13% of patients lived more than 30 km from their family physician. These patients were more likely to visit the emergency department for nonurgent reasons and had fewer visits with a family physician in the previous two years. They were also more likely to be male, to be under 65 years of age, to live in a low-income neighborhood, and to be newcomers to Ontario.

Our research shows that people use the emergency room not just because they don't have a family doctor or can't get an appointment. It's also because their family doctor might be too far away to reach easily. The distance makes it harder for many Ontarians to get the care they need when they need it most.""

Dr. Archna Gupta, scientist at Upstream Lab and family physician at St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, Toronto, Ontario

Patients who lived more than 150 km from their family physician had the highest odds of an emergency department visit for nonurgent reasons and were less likely to visit their physician. As well, the farther patients lived from their primary care physician, the less likely they were to undergo preventive screening for colorectal, breast, or cervical cancer.

The authors hope this study will aid policy-makers with health care planning.

""Incorporating distance to a family physician can provide policy-makers with a more nuanced understanding of unmet primary care demand. Our findings suggest that reforms should prioritize offering primary care a minimum of 30 km from a patient's home,"" conclude the authors.

New genetic research reveals that when students attend better schools, their reading success depends less on their DNA, showing that quality education can truly level the playing field.

Study: The genetic lottery goes to school: Better schools compensate for the effects of students' genetic differences. Image credit: Ground Picture/Shutterstock.com

Education's vital role in shaping lives makes fair and equal access to quality schooling a central policy goal around the world. A recent study published in PNAS highlights the role of schooling in mitigating the effects of poor genetic and social contexts determined by birth.  

Schools were initially established to address the inherent differences in background among students, including socioeconomic status, race, and sex. The current study aimed to investigate the impact of schooling on genetically mediated differences.

Such genetic differences significantly influence skill development, as affirmed by twin studies, which have shown that school performance has a 50% heritability. These genetic effects are closely intertwined with environmental influences. Understanding this interaction is essential for effective social policy, as it shows how environments can affect individuals differently based on their genetic makeup.

Twin studies have been limited by the fact that twins usually attend the same school, restricting variation in school-gene interactions. Even so, prior research suggests that teacher quality improved the genetic variance in reading skills and overall academic skills. This suggests that the effect of genetic differences is amplified rather than compensated for by the quality of schooling.

Such studies are improved by the use of polygenic indices (PGIs), which account for a few genetic effects rather than total heritability. These effects are linked to genes that have been variably associated with the trait of interest in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and are weighted accordingly.

Despite their narrower scope, PGIs are based on more representative samples. When considering PGIs based on GWAS associations with educational outcomes, the final effects are found within a specific social and academic background and do not signal intrinsic genetic weaknesses. In other words, given diverse contexts, lower educational status may be associated with different variants.

PGI-based studies exploring gene-environment interactions related to schooling have yielded conflicting results. This could be due to variations in the type of educational outcome examined, the stage of development under review, and the content being studied. Poor study design is another potential contributor, capturing outcome variability due to inherent characteristics in the students rather than the schools' ability to enhance learning.

It is also important to exclude bias due to the presence of confounding factors, which are associated factors irrelevant to the study but that affect the outcome. Within-family variation in PGIs is a valuable approach to reducing this type of bias, since it acts as a randomizer, a “genetic lottery”, where the effects are independent of other family attributes.

This still leaves room for bias due to the uncertainty surrounding whether social advantages lead to better educational outcomes. In this situation, the key question is whether supportive social environments amplify genetic advantages or help lessen the effects of genetic differences. The latter could be achieved by compensating for poor genetic risk or by inhibiting the outward effects of genetic risk factors.

The researchers used data from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), combined with that from the Norwegian register. The aim was to assess how the predisposition of children interacted with their educational status and the quality of their school. “The Norwegian context and rich educational data provide the ideal setting for validating our causal gene–environment interaction approach.”

MoBa provided genetic data on the mother, father, and offspring in each family set, which served as the basis for calculating polygenic indices (PGIEA). The family-based datasets helped identify within-family variation, which allowed the researchers to isolate causal genetic effects.

School value-added measures were estimated using the Norwegian register, resulting in estimates of school quality effects. Such measures were designed to capture the relevant difference in student outcomes precisely, that is, numeracy and reading skills. This makes it highly predictive for the student outcome of interest, with minimal bias.

This was based on standardized students' test scores such that the mean and standard deviation (SD) were zero and one, respectively, just like the standardized PGIEA itself. The challenge was to ensure that these measures were not confounded by other factors, such as student ability or the parents' socioeconomic status, which can independently affect school enrollment and, therefore, school outcomes.

Both sets of data were exploited to help uncover the causes of school-based interactions between the child's genes and environment.

The study showed that PGIEA and school value-added measures were independently varying factors. This allowed the researchers to separate the effects of genetic and schooling-related factors from each other and from the gene-environment interaction of interest.

PGIEA and school quality functioned as independent but substitutable factors in predicting reading outcomes, rather than one acting as a stand-in for the other. For schools that were 1 SD above average (by country standards), a 1 SD increase in PGIEA had a 6% lower-than-expected impact on reading test scores. This compensatory effect was observed within just one school year (grade 8, ages 13–14). Thus, the better the school was at teaching, the greater the impact on the reading outcomes of children who had a low PGIEA.

This interchangeability of PGIEA and school quality occurred because students at the lower end of the PGIEA gained significantly on reading scores. Better schools showed a lower impact of genetic differences on student outcomes due to the compensatory effect of schools on lower PGIEA. Conversely, students showed a greater decrease in their test scores when their genetic differences were adverse and they attended low-quality schools.

Such findings were absent, however, with numeracy test scores. This null result likely reflects higher persistence of numeracy skills (0.70 vs. 0.46 for reading), meaning new school inputs have less influence on mathematical ability at this developmental stage.

This suggests that investments in school quality may help reduce educational inequalities arising from genetic differences between students.

Within just one school year, among students aged 13-14 years, higher school quality helped develop children's skills more fairly. This occurred because good schooling reduced the gap in test reading scores between children with a better genetic predisposition and those with a worse one.

However, the study also suggests that the difference between low- and high-quality schools further increases the skill development gap between those with less and more genetic advantages in education.

A new Italian study reveals that a daily blend of citrus and grape extracts with chromium can normalize blood sugar and improve cholesterol faster than diet alone, offering new hope for millions living with prediabetes.



Study: Impact of a food supplement containing Citrus limon L. Osbeck and Vitis vinifera L. extracts, hesperidin and chromium in combination with an isocaloric diet on glucose and lipid metabolism in subjects with impaired fasting blood glucose: a single-center, controlled, randomized, parallel-arm, double-blind clinical trial. Image Credit: nnattalli / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, researchers investigated whether a novel food supplement could improve metabolic health in people with impaired fasting glucose (IFG). The study comprised a single-center, six-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial wherein 62 subjects with IFG were placed on a healthy diet. Half of the included participants received a supplement containing citrus and red grape extracts, hesperidin, and chromium (250 µg chromium and 560 mg total flavonoids per day).

Study findings revealed that supplementation reduced fasting blood glucose from 114 to 94 mg/dL within 6 months and achieved normal fasting levels by 3 months, while also improving low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C, ""bad"") cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C, ""good"") cholesterol, and triglycerides. In contrast, the placebo group showed a small reduction in fasting blood glucose (113 to 107 mg/dL), but it remained in the prediabetes range, with no meaningful lipid improvements and a rise in triglycerides, suggesting that this multi-ingredient approach may serve as a valuable strategy for managing prediabetes.

Impaired fasting glucose (IFG), commonly known as prediabetes, is a rapidly growing global health issue. It is characterized by blood sugar levels higher than normal but not yet diagnostic of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and is strongly linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Although prediabetes is often reversible through a healthy diet and exercise, adherence is low, and lifestyle measures alone are frequently insufficient. This has led researchers to explore nutritional supplements that can complement traditional lifestyle interventions and deliver measurable metabolic benefits.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial aimed to determine whether a specific blend of ingredients, chromium, hesperidin, and extracts from lemon and red grapes, could improve glucose metabolism and lipid balance in individuals with IFG. Fasting blood glucose served as the primary outcome, with HbA1c, insulin, HOMA-IR, and a full lipid panel as secondary endpoints.

The study enrolled 62 Italian adults (ages 18–75) diagnosed with IFG (fasting blood glucose levels of 100–125 mg/dL). Participants were randomly assigned to either the supplement or placebo group. The treatment group received two tablets daily (after lunch and dinner) for six months, while both groups followed an isocaloric DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. Use of additional glucose- or lipid-affecting supplements or drugs was prohibited.

The supplement provided 250 µg of chromium and 560 mg of flavonoids derived from Citrus limon (lemon), Vitis vinifera (red grape), and Citrus sinensis (orange). Participants received dietary counseling to maintain an isocaloric regimen. Blood samples were collected at baseline, three months, and six months to measure key biomarkers, including glucose, insulin, HbA1c, and lipid fractions.

The primary endpoint was the effect of supplementation on fasting blood glucose (FBG), while secondary endpoints included HbA1c, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and lipid markers (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides). Statistical analyses incorporated demographic and medical history corrections to ensure robust comparisons between groups.

The supplement group achieved a significant reduction in fasting glucose (114 to 94 mg/dL) compared with the placebo group (113 to 107 mg/dL). HbA1c decreased significantly only in the supplement group, while insulin and HOMA-IR showed no treatment effect. Lipid outcomes were also favorable, with LDL-C decreasing from 114 to 73 mg/dL, HDL-C increasing from 38 to 56 mg/dL, and triglycerides declining significantly (p = 0.011). Conversely, triglyceride levels increased in the placebo group (p = 0.0012). Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and creatinine levels indicated excellent tolerability.

This study supports the therapeutic potential of a citrus and grape extract supplement with hesperidin and chromium for managing prediabetes. Within six months, the formulation normalized blood glucose and improved lipid balance, suggesting strong cardiovascular benefits. However, limitations include the single-center design, restriction to participants with a BMI <30, and lack of post-trial follow-up, which may affect generalizability. Further multicenter human trials are recommended to validate the durability and scalability of the results.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Combined analysis of three blood tests enhances heart attack risk prediction","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251103/Combined-analysis-of-three-blood-tests-enhances-heart-attack-risk-prediction.aspx","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 13:02:00 GMT","

A combined analysis of blood tests to measure three biomarkers linked to higher risk of cardiovascular disease-lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), remnant cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)-may help identify high-risk individuals earlier and guide more personalized prevention strategies, according to a preliminary study to be presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting, Nov. 7-10, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science.

In the analysis, adults with elevated levels of all three biomarkers of heart disease had nearly three times the risk of a heart attack compared to participants with normal levels. The three blood tests examine different pathways that can lead to cardiovascular disease. Lipoprotein(a) is a type of cholesterol that is largely inherited and can cause plaque buildup in arteries. Remnant cholesterol refers to harmful fat particles in the blood that standard cholesterol tests can miss but can also clog arteries. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) measures inflammation in the body. Elevated levels of hsCRP may signal that the body is under stress and may indicate risk of damage to the arteries.

Each of the blood tests on its own indicate only a modest increase in heart attack risk, however, when we found elevated levels for all three, the risk of heart attack was nearly three times higher.""

Richard Kazibwe, M.D., M.S., lead researcher and assistant professor of internal medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina

""These biomarkers work together like pieces of a puzzle. One piece cannot show the full picture, yet when combined, we can see a much clearer and more complete depiction of heart attack risks,"" he added.

Researchers reviewed health data from the UK Biobank, one of the world's largest health databases, for more than 300,000 participants who were free of heart disease when they were first enrolled. Scientists tracked heart attack rates for these participants over a median follow-up of 15 years and calculated how many participants had each of the three blood test results in the highest 20% of values. The analysis found a clear stepwise pattern:

""A clear pattern confirmed that these biomarkers are related and together they reveal a 3-fold increase in heart attack risk. Evaluating the combined results of all three blood tests may help health care professionals act more quickly and provide tailored care for people with the highest risk. In addition, guidance that encourages healthy lifestyle changes or initiating treatment, such as medication to lower cholesterol and/or blood pressure, are keys to reducing risk and preventing heart attacks,"" Kazibwe said.

Although these blood tests are not yet part of routine screening guidelines, Kazibwe notes this combination approach may be more accessible than it initially appears. Lp(a) and hsCRP tests are available at most labs upon request, and health care professionals can calculate remnant cholesterol from standard cholesterol panels already performed during many routine checkups. Remnant cholesterol is calculated as total cholesterol minus LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol.

""Even if traditional risk factors like cholesterol and blood pressure are under control, these simple blood tests can identify hidden inflammation, genetic risk and cholesterol abnormalities. The results could help health care professionals detect heart disease risk earlier and guide steps to keep your heart healthy before symptoms appear or a cardiac event occurs,"" Kazibwe said.

The 2025 AHA/ACC High Blood Pressure Guideline recommends that health care professionals use the Predicting Risk of cardiovascular disease EVENTs (PREVENT™) equation to help assess cardiovascular disease risk and optimize primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Developed by the American Heart Association in 2023, the PREVENTTM risk calculator uses cardiovascular, kidney and metabolic health factors to more precisely estimate a person's cardiovascular disease risk, which can help guide treatment decisions personalized for each individual. Kazibwe emphasized that people with a family history of heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or other cardiovascular risk factors may particularly benefit from discussing these additional biomarker tests with their health care team.

""Advances in the accuracy and precision of risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (caused by plaque buildup in arterial walls) mean that clinicians can now more precisely identify individuals who are likely to benefit from preventive therapies,"" said Pamela Morris, M.D., FAHA, an American Heart Association volunteer expert and a professor of cardiology, Paul V. Palmer Endowed Chair in cardiovascular disease prevention and director of the Seinsheimer Cardiovascular Health Program at the Medical University of South Carolina.

""However, risk estimation remains the starting point. This study supports recommendations that consideration of risk enhancers including Lp(a), hsCRP and remnant cholesterol can play an important role in personalizing risk estimates. The findings indicate that these biomarkers can aid in clinical decision making, particularly for those patients in whom treatment decisions are uncertain,"" said Morris, who was not involved in the study.

Kazibwe acknowledges some health care professionals may initially be cautious about adding more tests due to cost and insurance coverage considerations, however, growing research and new treatments are making these tests increasingly relevant in preventive cardiology care.

""The three biomarker tests represent part of a larger toolkit for assessing heart attack risks that also include genetic risk scores and coronary artery calcium scans. The future challenge will be learning how to combine all this information to help health care professionals make personalized decisions for each patient,"" he said.

Study details, background and design:

The research has important limitations. As an observational study, the findings show patterns in the data but cannot prove elevated levels of these biomarkers directly caused the heart attacks. Research is needed to determine if using these tests to guide treatment decisions leads to improved patient outcomes or saves lives. The findings also come from the UK Biobank, with approximately 95% of participants identifying as white. Additional research would be needed to confirm whether the results apply broadly to diverse populations in the U.S. and other countries.

The kids are alright. That was the overwhelming feeling as the U.S. women's national team closed out the October international window with two wins and one defeat. In Emma Hayes's short reign as head coach of the USWNT, she has given 25 players their international debut over the past 19 months. 

The USWNT kicked off the October window with the worst possible start, throwing away an early 1–0 lead and losing to Portugal 2–1. After making eight changes to her starting XI in the rematch with Portugal, the USWNT bounced back in a big way to win 3–1. The window closed with a 6–0 thrashing of New Zealand, which was much harder to evaluate.

Let's look at who made their case, and what questions remain from these latest friendlies.

The 20-year-old attacker has not been a constant since making her senior national team debut in 2023, but a career-best season in the NWSL with the Portland Thorns has pushed her back into Hayes's plans. Moultrie grabbed her opportunity with both hands and scored a quick brace in the 3–1 win over Portugal. 

Moultrie offers Hayes versatility in the midfield and forward lines. She has the distribution to play deep and help generate passes that move the play forward, setting up chances for others. In a more advanced role, as seen against Portugal, she possesses the ability to finish chances and occupy lethal spaces in the box. It's a crowded field, but Moultrie is certainly making herself known.

The 19-year-old center back is making the most of established defenders Tierna Davidson, Alana Cook and Naomi Girma, all being absent due to injury. With poise well beyond her years, Bugg thrived, picking up two starts in both of the USWNT's wins in the October window. 

In the 3–1 win over Portugal, Bugg completed 68 of 69 passes, the most of any player on the pitch. She was calm and confident when building from the back. Unlike the more cavalier approach of Emily Sonnett, Bugg has a way of not committing too early to an opposing forward, which helps squash the threat of second balls. 

With only four caps to her name and just over a year in the books as a professional, she still has plenty to learn. However, Hayes may want to keep Bugg around to develop into the role rather than turning straight back to older players once they become available again.

In the 6–0 win over New Zealand, the Racing Louisville winger scored the first USWNT hat trick in 1,299 days. Known for her blazing pace on the wings, Sears excelled in the October window when it came to drifting more centrally to get the final touch in a passing move and finishing from close range. 

Although Sears only had one start across the October window's three matches, she appeared off the bench in the other two. The 24-year-old was one of just six players on the USWNT roster to appear in all three friendlies, which was an encouraging sign that Hayes knows how she wants the winger to fit into her lineups.

With Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson all missing, having a nose for goals will keep you getting called up to camp.

Not one, not two, but THREE for Emma Sears 3️⃣USWNT x @VW pic.twitter.com/3WXCeRi4X8

When it comes to the goalkeepers, Hayes opted to play Phallon Tullis-Joyce in the first friendly, followed by Claudia Dickey in the second and third friendlies. That left Mandy McGlynn without any minutes during the October window.

It's been one year since McGlynn made her USWNT debut, and, in that time, her club form with Utah Royals has dipped after a very impressive 2024. McGlynn appears to be the third goalkeeper option on the roster, which opens the door for Hayes to potentially experiment with another in her place.

McGlynn has age on her side, being just 27 years old, which is relatively young for a goalkeeper. While Tullis-Joyce's shot-stopping remains the best in the group, there is a world in which McGlynn can keep impressing with her feet when the USWNT wants to play out of the back.

The upside of versatile players is that they can be deployed in many roles; the downside is a lack of clarity on their best position. Sentnor hasn't seemed to have quite nailed down a preferred spot in the USWNT.

Despite often being used as an inverted winger in the NWSL, Hayes has continued to push Sentnor as a central attacking forward or as a false nine. Sentnor hasn't shown a cutting edge in front of the goal or an ability to link with teammates in tight spaces. 

The upside for Sentnor is her set-piece delivery—which earned an assist for Sam Coffey's goal in the 3–1 win over Portugal—does give her an extra feather in her cap when it comes to Hayes evaluating her forwards.

After McKeown started in the 2–1 defeat to Portugal, and the USWNT conceded two set-piece goals from crosses into the box, she was not seen again in the window. It wasn't all her fault. The USWNT defense lacked intensity and organization in that first game. 

Aerial balls into the box appear to be a weak spot for the USWNT right now, and McKeown will need to be at her best moving forward to show that she can be the solution to the problem. McKeown can be instrumental, building out of the back with the ball at her feet. However, the same adventurous approach she has at the club level with the Washington Spirit hasn't quite translated to the USWNT. 

Hayes hopes McKeown's confidence and cohesion with her USWNT teammates will grow, allowing her to transform into a key ball passer from deep at the international level. With nine caps for her country, all coming in 2025, it is still very early in the 26-year-old's USWNT career. The question is whether Hayes will allow more time to go to younger defenders, such as Bugg, Kennedy Wesley, or perhaps even Trinity Armstrong.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","The Americans Abroad Five: New clubs, old problems","https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com/story/sports/usmnt/2025/11/03/americans-abroad-usmnt-players-struggle-at-new-clubs/87057846007/","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 14:12:34 GMT","

For some Americans Abroad, joining a new club hasn't provided the boost they would have hoped.

Three players in the mix for the U.S. men's national team (including one who hasn't yet committed) sought out stability and prosperity with an offseason change of scenery. But at least early on, the returns for all three haven't been promising.

There is still time for the trio — all of whom are either 22 or 21 years old — either in their current location or with another change of scenery. But the hurdles grow larger by the week.

Let's get to the Five.

If Gio Reyna was hoping for a bounce-back campaign that would vault him back in the USMNT picture, the early signs aren't promising.

After an offseason move to Borussia Mönchengladbach, the 22-year-old has settled into a familiar pattern of niggling injuries and late-game cameos.

Reyna was given just 11 minutes in a 4-0 away win at St. Pauli on Saturday. Though he actually looked solid in his time on the field, Reyna has now played barely over a half of soccer in four games since returning from a thigh injury.

Reyna has the talent to start every game for a struggling Gladbach side but after the club's first win of the season, coach Eugen Polanski seems unlikely to change things up ahead of next week's game against Köln.

With the USMNT roster for November friendlies expected soon, Reyna may have to wait until March to prove to Mauricio Pochettino that he's worth a World Cup roster spot.

The most disappointing Americans Abroad transfer in the early season has to be Damion Downs' move to Southampton from FC Köln.

Despite earning promotion with Köln, Downs opted to drop down to the Championship with Saints. But it has been an almighty struggle for the 21-year-old, who has started just one league game and is still looking for his first goal with his new side.

It's already got so bad for Downs that he felt compelled to delete his social media accounts amid a torrent of abuse from fans.

But there could be a glimmer of hope now for Downs, with Southampton sacking coach Will Still over the weekend. Still had clearly lost faith in the striker, and a new boss should see the €10 million signing as part of any potential solution for the 21st-place Saints.

Whether that happens or not, though, will now be on Downs.

Luca Koleosho moved back to Espanyol this summer looking to jumpstart his career, but so far it's been more struggles for the 21-year-old winger.

Koleosho emerged as perhaps the priority recruit for U.S. Soccer in 2023-24, breaking out with Burnley in an explosive first half of the season in the Premier League.

But a midseason knee injury brought his momentum to a halt, and the Connecticut-born Italy youth international hasn't regained his spark yet.

Koleosho struggled to replicate his form last season with Burnley in the Championship, before joining former side Espanyol on loan this summer.

But it's been a slog so far for Koleosho, who has made just four appearances all season and missed this weekend's game with an injury. He's still just 21, but it's worth pondering how costly that knee injury truly was.

To say Tyler Adams is not a goalscorer would be a serious understatement.

Before Adams swept home a poor clearance from Gianluigi Donnarumma on Sunday, it had been almost five years since his last goal at club level.

The Bournemouth midfielder's goal at Manchester City was vital at the time, leveling the game at 1-1 midway through the first half. But the Cherries, like so many others, simply couldn't contain Erling Haaland, who scored a brace in a 3-1 win for the home side.

Despite the loss, Adams' goal was a just reward for a campaign that has seen him start every game for a team that still ended the weekend in the top four.

Pochettino hasn't been making many friends at European clubs lately.

Only a couple weeks after AC Milan was reportedly fuming over Pochettino's usage of Christian Pulisic during the October window, Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner aired out a similar complaint over Chris Richards.

“My only complaint is the U.S. team didn't talk to us because Chris was struggling with his calf for many weeks,” Glasner said ahead of Saturday's game against Brentford.

“We talked to them and said he should rest as they were just friendlies. But they played him twice, every single minute. That's a little bit disappointing. On the other side, we've tried to manage his minutes here.""

The main difference between Pulisic and Richards' situations is in the severity of their injuries. Pulisic is set to miss a month, while Richards only had to miss a midweek Carabao Cup win over Liverpool before returning in a 2-0 victory over Brentford.

But Richards clearly isn't fully over his calf injury, making it a situation worth monitoring for a player who's become indispensable for club and country.","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

It was a significant weekend for Bournemouth's American midfield destroyer, while Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner questioned whether his Mr Dependable is playing too many minutes for club and country.

There were also clean sheets for a Championship pair who have played their way into contention for the November internationals.

Welcome to the USMNT Player Tracker.

Tyler Adams is in the form of his life.

It has been an excellent start to the season for his Bournemouth side, who began the weekend's action sitting second in the Premier League. Adams has been a crucial part of Andoni Iraola's early success, starting every league match this season and registering his first assist of the term in Bournemouth's 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest last week.

After injuries halted his early impact at the Vitality Stadium, Adams has been a nailed-on starter for the entirety of 2025. Still, there was one thing that had eluded him: his first goal in English football. Against Manchester City on Sunday, that finally arrived.

In the 25th minute, City goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made a hash of Alex Scott's inswinging corner, miscuing his punch into Adams' direction, who converted on the volley from close range to make the score 1-1. Across spells at Leeds United and Bournemouth, it was Adams' 73rd appearance in English football in all competitions.

Despite the game ending 3-1 to City, Bournemouth are troubling the Premier League's elite under Iraola, and sit fourth. They face Aston Villa on Sunday before Adams joins up with the national team again, having missed the October window as his wife was due to give birth to their second child.

Similar to Adams, Chris Richards is enjoying the best season of his Premier League career.

He has been an ever-present for Palace in the league this season, contributing to another strong defensive performance in their 2-0 win over Brentford on Saturday. Richards also played the full 90 minutes in Palace's full European debut, helping them beat Dynamo Kyiv 2-0 in the Conference League on October 2. When coach Glasner rested him for their trip to Cyprus to face AEK Larnaca in their second fixture, they lost 1-0.

Richards is an indispensable star for club and country — and because of that, he's playing a lot of football. Glasner is concerned.

“My only complaint is the U.S. team didn't talk to us because Chris was struggling with his calf for many weeks,” the Austrian said in his pre-match press conference on Friday. “We talked to them and said he should rest as they were just friendlies. But they played him twice, every single minute. That's a little bit disappointing. On the other side, we've tried to manage his minutes here, resting him against AEK Larnaca, but you can't cheat your body.”

Palace are back in action at Selhurst Park on Thursday against Dutch side AZ. Glasner's squad selections indicate he is taking the competition very seriously, so it would not be a surprise to see him pick a full-strength squad again. And with a home tie against rivals Brighton & Hove Albion on Sunday, there's little chance of Richards being rested on the weekend.

But with Richards in such impressive form, you can hardly blame USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino. Richards will undoubtedly be a key part of the squad next summer.

Despite playing under another new club manager in Luciano Spalletti, Weston McKennie continues to be one of Serie A's most impressive utility men, playing 85 minutes as a quasi-right-winger in Juventus' 2-1 win against Cremonese.

He was his typical industrious self without possession, winning two tackles and making four recoveries. But he also showed his attacking qualities, creating two chances with an expected assists tally of 0.72. Alongside his sole shot — a close-range effort that flew past the post — the data suggests he may have contributed to a goal on the day, with his combined expected goals and assists tally at 1.0.

Christian Pulisic was absent for the fourth game running for Milan after sustaining a hamstring injury on international duty last month, but he is ex for Milan's next league fixture on November 8.

“Pulisic should return against Parma,” said Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri. “Let's see if Pulisic will be back in Parma and then join his national team… We are in contact with all the national team coaches to tell them our players' conditions.”

In Scotland, Auston Trusty did his chances of becoming an established Celtic starter no harm as his side beat Rangers 3-1 in the semi-final of the Scottish League Cup (known as the Premier Sports Cup). Trusty even registered an assist in the Old Firm, one of the world's most famous and hotly contested derby matches.

Goalkeeping hopeful Ethan Horvath had one of the finest displays of the weekend, keeping a clean sheet for Sheffield Wednesday in a 0-0 draw at The Hawthorns against a much-fancied West Bromwich Albion. He's had a challenging start to the season, with Wednesday sitting at the bottom of the table on minus five points after suffering a 12-point deduction for entering administration. Daryl Dike came on for the home side in the 90th minute, but was unable to make much of an impression with his limited time on the field.

Elsewhere in the Championship, Haji Wright was quiet as Coventry suffered their first loss of the league season, falling 3-2 to Wrexham. Josh Sargent couldn't break his goalscoring duck as Norwich City were beaten 2-0 by Hull City, and Aidan Morris made a limited impact in Middlesbrough's 3-0 defeat to Watford.

Damion Downs will be playing under a new head coach, with Southampton calling time on Will Still's disastrous tenure at the helm after a 2-0 away defeat to Preston, which leaves them 21st in the Championship table.

In more positive news, Patrick Agyemang proved an excellent foil for hat-trick hero Carlton Morris as Derby County dispatched Sheffield United, and USMNT-eligible Charlie Kelman scored his first goal of the season in Charlton Athletic's 1-1 draw with Swansea City.

McKennie will be hoping his Juventus side can earn their first win of this season's Champions League against Portugal's Sporting CP tomorrow, available on ESPN3 and Paramount+.

Sergino Dest's PSV and Folarin Balogun's Monaco will also be in action in the Champions League on Tuesday, where they will face Olympiacos and Bodo/Glimt. These matches will also be available on Paramount+.

There are just over 200 days to go until the U.S. men's national team laces up and hits the pitch for the opening game of the 2026 FIFA World Cup at SoFi Stadium.

With the pressing issues of form and fitness, and a desire to crack head coach Mauricio Pochettino's 26-player roster, each match at club level is critical for every player as they look towards their ultimate goal of representing the country. 

A number of high-profile players were in action, but it was actually those who are on the periphery who stood up to be counted as the calendar flipped over until November. 

Here's Sports Illustrated's top five USMNT performances of the week.

Pochettino has largely overlooked Joe Scally, but the man with 21 USMNT caps helped Borussia Mönchengladbach keep a clean sheet in a 4–0 win over FC St. Pauli in Bundesliga action. Scally played all 90 minutes as a right wingback and got forward to fire a shot off the post, while also chipping in with seven defensive contributions.With the shift to a back three for the USMNT, a prolonged period of good form as a right wingback could put him back into the running for a 2026 World Cup roster spot.

Ricardo Pepi kept up his strong form in the Eredivisie with a goal in a 5–2 win over Fortuna Sittard, his fourth of the season, to help PSV Eindhoven to second in the league table. While the former FC Dallas standout didn't start the match, he made quick work off the bench after entering in the 60th minute. Outside of the goal, he completed all 10 of his attempted passes and had 15 touches as an impactful substitute. The worry for Pepi, though, is the lack of starts. PSV have leaned on Guus Til and Ismael Saibari to lead the attack, and both hit the scoresheet in the win as well. However, after the game, manager Peter Bosz reiterated that Pepi is his top choice, but has been held out due to the team's success.

It hasn't been a stellar 2025–26 campaign for either Celtic or Rangers, with both changing managers in the blink of an eye. But despite their respective struggles, the Old Firm remains one of the world's most intense derbies, and an American defender was in the thick of it all on Sunday afternoon. Auston Trusty, who has largely been left out of the USMNT under Pochettino, helped Celtic to a 3–1 win over Rangers in the Scottish League Cup semifinal, putting up an assist in the 120-minute effort after the game ended 1–1 after 90 minutes. The 27-year-old only returned to action midweek after recovering from a foot injury, and stood out in the semifinal, earning the club's Player of the Match award. 

Tyler Adams isn't known for scoring goals. Yet, he bagged his first goal since 2021, and the first of his in the Premier League, in AFC Bournemouth's 3–1 loss to Manchester City on Sunday. The goal came in his 65th Premier League appearance, and was just the seventh goal of his professional career, with three of those seven coming with New York Red Bulls II in the USL Championship. While the Cherries weren't able to pull out a positive result at the Etihad Stadium, Adams had a career moment to remember. However, he had to come out in the 80th minute with what looked to be a minor knee injury after receiving treatment on the field.

While players in Europe will play right through to the summer, the 2025 MLS Cup playoffs are vital to the American players playing on home soil. Any players eliminated won't have any club matches until the season starts up again in February, missing out on time to find form ahead of the World Cup. Max Arfsten and the Columbus Crew faced that issue on Sunday night, sitting on the brink of elimination after losing Game 1 of their first-round best-of-three series against Hell is Real rivals FC Cincinnati. Yet, Arfsten and his side stepped up, with the American netting the opening and eventual winning goal in a 4–0 victory, which forced a decisive Game 3 in one of the league's most heated rivalries. In addition to his goal, he also had an assist, eight completed dribbles, and created four chances, earning him Player of the Match honors. Game 3 of the series is set for Nov. 8 at FC Cincinnati's TQL Stadium.

An expanded edition of the FIFA World Cup and a robust talent pool of 2008 players based in the United States has presented a unique opportunity for U.S.-based talent.

The field of 48 teams is set to feature more than 20 players from clubs in the United States competing for other countries.

Here are some of the names to know.

Felix Contreras, Mexico

A center back from Real Salt Lake, Contreras is originally from California. He's a quality and stable option at the back.

Nikolai Pierre, Haiti

Haiti's arrival at the tournament brings with it Pierre, who is on the books with the Orlando City SC Academy. 

Van Parker, Canada

November 3 – Brazilian club Flamengo has booked a record revenue of 1.56 billion reais (€249 million) for the first three quarters of 2025. 

The figure is the highest ever in Brazilian football and an increase of 27% on the first three quarters of 2024. The club said that the positive cash flow (R$173.9m/€27.8 million) is mainly due to the Club World Cup, the proceeds from player sales, and instalment payments for new players. Last summer, Flamengo exited the maiden 32-team tournament in the second round against Bayern Munich, amassing R$ 152,7 million (€24.4m) in prize money according to Brazilian media.

Flamengo also sold players for a total of R$ 511 million (€81.8m), a new club record. Gerson (R$ 158,4 million)/€25.3 million), Wesley (R$ 154 milion/€24.6m) and Matheus Gonçalves (R$ 51 million/€8.2m) were Flamengo's principle exports.

On the expenses side, Samuel Lino became the club's most expensive player for R$ 195.1 million (€31.2m). Jorge Carrascal was bought from Dynamo for R$107 million (€17.1m) and Emerson Royal cost Flamengo R$ 78.6 million (€12.6m). The three transfers cost R$31.8 million (€5.1m) in intermediary fees.

Last week, the Rio club qualified for the final of the Copa Libertadores, the South American equivalent of the Champions League, edging past Racing Club of Argentina 1-0 over two legs. At the weekend, Flamengo breezed past Sport 3-0 to remain second in the Brazilian league table behind Palmeiras, their opponents in the Copa Libertadores final.

Manchester City goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has been named in the 2025 FIFPRO Men's World 11.

The FIFPRO Men's World 11 and FIFPRO Women's World 11 are all-star teams made up of the game's leading footballers and voted by the players, with this year's qualifying period falling between 15 July 2024 to 3 August 2025.

Donnarumma enjoyed an exceptional campaign across that timeframe with former club Paris Saint-Germain, helping the French side to their 13th Ligue One title before playing a key role as PSG went on to win the UEFA Champions League for the first time.

The Italian international produced exceptional performances in the knockout stages against Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal while in the final against Internazionale, he kept a clean sheet as PSG won 5–0 to secure a first-ever continental treble.

Prior to joining City this summer, he also helped Luis Enrique's side reach the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final.

Having made the move to City at the start of September, Donnarumma has since continued that magnificent form and played a major part in helping Pep Guardiola's side rise into second place in the Premier League table and make an unbeaten start to our Champions League campaign.

Donnarumma's latest special recognition also comes hard on the heels of the 26-year-old winning the 2025 Yashin Trophy  – awarded to the best goalkeeper over the past 12 months – at September's Ballon d'Or awards ceremony.

More than 26,000 professionals from 68 countries took part in this year's FIFPRO XI selection, picking the three players who, in their opinion, were the most outstanding in each of the following positions: goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and forwards.

GOALKEEPER: Gianluigi Donnarumma (Paris Saint-Germain / Manchester City, Italy)

DEFENDERS: Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool, Netherlands); Achraf Hakimi (Paris Saint-Germain, Morocco); Nuno Mendes (Paris Saint-Germain, Portugal)

MIDFIELDERS: Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid, England); Cole Palmer (Chelsea, England); Pedri (Barcelona, Spain); Vitinha (Paris Saint-Germain, Portugal)

FORWARDS: Ousmane Dembele (Paris Saint-Germain, France); Kylian Mbappe (Real Madrid, France); Lamine Yamal (Barcelona, Spain)

Erling Haaland and former City star Kevin De Bruyne were both nominated in the Men's shortlist with City skipper Alex Greenwood making the Women's shortlist.

Everyone at Manchester City congratulates Gianluigi on this latest achievement.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Europe's champions vs Europe's best team? How Harry Kane and Vincent Kompany have made Bayern Munich the biggest threat to PSG's Champions League crown","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/harry-kane-vincent-kompany-bayern-munich-biggest-threat-psg-champions-league-crown/blt3fbedcf160c180d9","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

The mood surrounding Bayern Munich heading into September was not one of great optimism. Vincent Kompany missed out on his two main transfer targets, Florian Wirtz and Nick Woltemade, and his side were given a huge scare by third-tier Wehen Wiesbaden in the first round of the DFB-Pokal, with an injury-time winner from Harry Kane ultimately sparing Bayern's blushes.


Wirtz was seen as the ideal short-term replacement and long-term partner for Jamal Musiala, who was sidelined until at least the end of the year after breaking his leg at the Club World Cup. However, the Bayer Leverkusen hero opted to join Premier League champions Liverpool, which was seen as evidence of Bayern's diminished status as one of Europe's elite sides.

More weight was added to that theory when Bayern almost blew a three-goal lead when limping to an unconvincing 3-2 win at Augsburg on August 30. The consensus was that Kompany had enough quality at his disposal to defend the Bundesliga title, but not to oversee a proper assault on the Champions League.

Fast-forward just 65 days, though, and Bayern have defied all expectations. They have a perfect record through their first 15 matches of the 2025-26 campaign - an unprecedented run that has never been matched in the history of Europe's top-five leagues. Bayern sit five points clear at the Bundesliga summit already with 33 goals scored and just four conceded, and they're second in the Champions League table, having beaten Chelsea 3-1 on matchday one before routing Pafos 5-1 and Club Brugge 4-0.

Reigning European champions Paris Saint-Germain are top, courtesy of narrowly outscoring the German giants by 13 to 12 in their first three games, but Bayern have the chance to make a huge statement of intent when they travel to Parc des Princes to face Luis Enrique's side on Tuesday.

A 16th consecutive victory would see Die Roten installed as the new outright favourites for the trophy and complete a remarkable turnaround. Kompany has seemingly transformed Bayern overnight, and if they accomplish their latest goal, there may be no stopping the new Allianz Arena juggernaut in any competition...

On Saturday, Bayer Leverkusen became Bayern's latest victims in a 3-0 defeat that saw Kasper Hjulmand's team completely outclassed in every department. Serge Gnabry raced clear to open the scoring in the 25th minute and Nicolas Jackson doubled the hosts' account with a fine header moments later, claiming his first Bundesliga goal since joining the club on loan from Chelsea.

A Loic Bade own-goal gave Bayern a three-goal advantage at the interval, as Kompany's decision to rest key trio Kane, Luis Diaz and Michael Olise for the first half paid off handsomely. They all came on early in the second and helped Bayern cruise to victory against a Leverkusen side that hadn't lost a league game since August 23.

The final result also ended Leverkusen's two-season unbeaten run away from home, leaving Aleix Garcia certain of one thing. ""Bayern are currently the best team in Europe,"" the Leverkusen midfielder told Sky Germany.

Hjulmand was similarly effusive in his praise: ""We have to recognise that Bayern are an absolutely top team. They punished our mistakes immediately. We're not satisfied with our performance, we have a lot to work on, but overall Bayern were just too good. We have to acknowledge that.""

It feels like Bayern are too good for anyone right now, and thanks to Kompany's bold selection calls, the Bundesliga leaders are poised to claim their biggest scalp yet.

""From this moment on I am more confident of what the team can do. Obviously we are better when Harry plays but we will have a top-fit Harry against Paris,"" the Belgian coach said in his post-match press conference. ""Today it felt like the moment for the other lads. Now we can go into that game without any fitness concerns. Tuesday will be the highest intensity you can have, the highest in Europe, I think.""

PSG have every reason to fear Kane. The former Tottenham striker is in the form of his life, with 22 goals to his name from 15 appearances across all competitions so far this season, and he's emerged as the early front-runner for the 2026 Ballon d'Or.

Kane's latest stellar display came in the second round of the DFB-Pokal last Wednesday as Bayern eased to a 4-1 win over Koln. He produced a sublime turn and finish to make it 2-1 on the night and added his second when nodding in a Joshua Kimmich corner just past the hour mark. One of the main reasons Bayern have been so effective in recent weeks is Kane's ruthlessness from half-chances, both on the ground and in the air, and PSG will have to keep him quiet to have any hope of halting their momentum.

Under Kompany's guidance, Kane has become arguably the most lethal centre-forward in world football, but his playmaking skills have also been crucial for Bayern to make up for the absence of Musiala. The 32-year-old, who is ageing like a fine wine, doesn't just come alive in the box; he's always involved in the build-up and sets the tone with his technical brilliance.

Thanks to the presence of Jackson, Bayern also now have the option to use Kane as No.10, which worked perfectly during their Klassiker win over Dortmund last month. Kane has given Kompany ""full credit"" for his surge, saying: ""I think he has unlocked a different level in me. He is a fantastic coach, not just tactically but also as a person.""

Bayern are perfectly set up to play to Kane's strengths and Kompany knows exactly how to keep his motivation levels high. And, unlike last season, Kane is now delivering as part of a fully-functioning unit instead of shouldering nearly all the responsibility for their success.

""He's felt what his role in our team can be, also among his team-mates. He then also shows his quality, not just with goals but also how he gets others involved,"" Kompany said before the Dortmund game. ""We hope he can keep that up, but there's no extra pressure on him if he happens to perform less once in a while. The others will compensate there. We've got great trust in our squad.""

There is, however, one player who stands out for pushing Kane hardest for the title of Bayern's main man this term. Diaz became Bayern's third-most expensive player ever, after Kane and Lucas Hernandez, when he signed from Liverpool for €75 million (£66m/$87m) in the summer transfer window, but the deal didn't generate that much excitement in Munich.

Diaz had been deemed surplus to requirements at Anfield by Liverpool boss Arne Slot, and it was widely reported that Athletic Club's Nico Williams was Bayern's first-choice target. Dietmar Hamman even went so far as to claim Liverpool were ""laughing"" after banking such a huge fee for the Colombian, but Bayern fans have had way more to smile about than the Reds' faithful since his switch.

There was perhaps no Liverpool player more under-appreciated than Diaz during their run to the 2024-25 Premier League title. He racked up 18 goal contributions overall, second only to Mohamed Salah, and his ability to shift effortlessly between the left flank and central striker roles became of great importance down the finishing stretch.

Diaz has seamlessly transferred that form to Bayern, scoring eight goals in his first 15 appearances while setting up another five. Kompany has given Diaz and Olise licence to take games by the scruff of the neck, with the former leading the Bundesliga for shots attempted with 34 and the latter sitting second on 29.

Bayern often struggled for fluency last season, but Diaz has completed their attack by injecting a significant dose of intensity and quality. He is a master of creating chaos on the transition and leads their press, with a large chunk of the team's opportunities generated after he has battled to win the ball back high up the pitch.

Kane has said he felt an ""instant connection"" with Diaz, and you can see that bond in their link-up play, which no team in Europe has found an answer to yet. That €75m price tag suddenly looks like a bargain, and Diaz is finally getting the credit he deserves.

Kompany has also been rewarded for taking a risk on Bayern academy jewel Lennart Karl. The 17-year-old was still playing for the Under-19s in February, but Kompany has since fast-tracked his development, first by including him in Bayern's Club World Cup squad, then by giving him a regular place in the senior side this season.

Karl now has 13 first-team appearances under his belt, including four starts, and has been a revelation. Capable of playing as a right winger or a No.10, the German wonderkid plays with a level of maturity and confidence that belies his years. He's a quick, agile forward who dribbles with a low centre of gravity and excels at taking the ball on the half-turn.

Comparisons with Arjen Robben have also been drawn because Karl has a wand for a left foot. There were certainly shades of the Bayern icon in Karl's first goal for the club, which saw him ghost past three Club Brugge defenders before unleashing an unstoppable shot straight into the top corner.

That stunning effort made Karl the youngest player to ever score for Bayern in the Champions League, and three days later, he opened his account in the Bundesliga against Borussia Monchengladbach with another remarkable strike after cutting in from the left.

""He's a fantastic player. He's not afraid to dribble,"" Kane has said of his supremely talented new team-mate. ""He just has to keep working hard, and he'll have a great future ahead of him.""  

Kompany is carefully managing Karl's minutes, but he's now a proper wildcard option for Bayern. At the very least, the teenager's versatility could prove useful to cover any injuries and suspensions, and at best, he has the potential to be a decisive impact player as the season progresses.

Bayern are by some distance the top scorers across Europe's top-five leagues, which is in no small part due to a shrewd tactical tweak from Kompany. The former Burnley boss prioritised possession and controlling games in his first year at the helm, but Bayern are now a far more direct team that focuses on vertical passing and explosive counter-attacks.

They are also regularly retreating into a mid-block to tempt opponents forward and open up more space in behind, particularly after they go ahead. The aim is to break quickly and incisively as soon as the ball is recovered, and the results have been devastating.

Bayern now attack with up to six players to overload the defensive line as Kompany encourages his full-backs to bomb forward. It's an aggressive, high-energy approach that you'd think would leave Bayern vulnerable to counters themselves, but that has not been the case. With so many players in close proximity when they lose the ball, Bayern rapidly close down their opponents and force mistakes.

""He brought his own hunger to a team that was perhaps a little complacent,"" explained Koln coach Lucas Kwasniok of ""giant, real bear"" Kompany following their Pokal meeting. ""He instilled a distinct identity in Bayern's work against the ball – there's no room for compromise. The players are fully committed because they see that they can devour their opponents this way. They practically squeeze air out of you.""

Defenders like Jonathan Tah, Konrad Laimer and Josep Stanisic are not blessed with pace, but they're very rarely exposed because so few teams are able to play through the Bayern press. There's only a small window of opportunity when it does happen, too, because Bayern bust a gut as a collective to get back into a solid shape.

Interestingly, Gnabry now stays up instead of Kane when Bayern are defending, which also makes a big difference to the rapid turnovers. Kompany has turned the team from a slinky into a coiled spring, and it's been absolutely thrilling to watch their evolution.

""It's practically impossible to beat Bayern right now,"" Kwasniok added. ""That's the truth, because they're simply incredibly good. I've rarely seen a top team willing to invest so much. They have the unyielding will to win the treble.""

PSG will be the toughest test yet for Bayern, who lost 2-0 to the Ligue 1 champions in the Club World Cup quarter-finals, but they should go into Tuesday's game full of belief. Luis Enrique's team have been superb in the Champions League again, with a scarily impressive win at Barcelona wedged in between demolition jobs against Atalanta and Leverkusen, but Marseille, Lorient, Strasbourg and Lille have all taken points off them in the French top-flight.

Injuries could play into Bayern's hands, too. Ballon d'Or holder Ousmane Dembele is a doubt while Desire Doue has been ruled out for the foreseeable future after suffering a tear in his left thigh. There will also be a gaping hole in the PSG defence as Illia Zabarnyi serves a one-match ban for the red card he picked up against Leverkusen. Marquinhos has only just returned from a layoff, too, and with Kane, Diaz and Olise firing all cylinders, Bayern have the tools to overpower the French giants. 

A draw would put both sides in a strong position for automatic qualification to the round of 16, but Kompany has vowed Bayern ""will go all out"" for another win while continuing to embrace a ""rock n' roll"" style of play. It's precisely that attitude that has won the Belgian the full trust of his players and the fans.

""They have hit the jackpot with Kompany,"" Bayern icon Lothar Matthaus said to Sky Germany after the ex-Burnley boss was handed a two-year contract extension in October. ""Kompany has again involved the players in his decisions and clear, open, honest speeches. He reinvented FC Bayern after four or five years of unrest and did a lot of things that the club missed in those years.""

That opinion will be universal if Kompany's relentless team can silence Parc des Princes, and Bayern can then really start dreaming about a seventh Champions League crown.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Crystal Palace's Chris Richards and Bournemouth's Tyler Adams Getty Images

It was a significant weekend for Bournemouth's American midfield destroyer, while Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner questioned whether his Mr Dependable is playing too many minutes for club and country.

There were also clean sheets for a Championship pair who have played their way into contention for the November internationals.

Welcome to the USMNT Player Tracker.

Tyler Adams is in the form of his life.

It has been an excellent start to the season for his Bournemouth side, who began the weekend's action sitting second in the Premier League. Adams has been a crucial part of Andoni Iraola's early success, starting every league match this season and registering his first assist of the term in Bournemouth's 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest last week.

After injuries halted his early impact at the Vitality Stadium, Adams has been a nailed-on starter for the entirety of 2025. Still, there was one thing that had eluded him: his first goal in English football. Against Manchester City on Sunday, that finally arrived.

In the 25th minute, City goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made a hash of Alex Scott's inswinging corner, miscuing his punch into Adams' direction, who converted on the volley from close range to make the score 1-1. Across spells at Leeds United and Bournemouth, it was Adams' 73rd appearance in English football in all competitions.

Despite the game ending 3-1 to City, Bournemouth are troubling the Premier League's elite under Iraola, and sit fourth. They face Aston Villa on Sunday before Adams joins up with the national team again, having missed the October window as his wife was due to give birth to their second child.

Similar to Adams, Chris Richards is enjoying the best season of his Premier League career.

He has been an ever-present for Palace in the league this season, contributing to another strong defensive performance in their 2-0 win over Brentford on Saturday. Richards also played the full 90 minutes in Palace's full European debut, helping them beat Dynamo Kyiv 2-0 in the Conference League on October 2. When coach Glasner rested him for their trip to Cyprus to face AEK Larnaca in their second fixture, they lost 1-0.

Richards is an indispensable star for club and country — and because of that, he's playing a lot of football. Glasner is concerned.

“My only complaint is the U.S. team didn't talk to us because Chris was struggling with his calf for many weeks,” the Austrian said in his pre-match press conference on Friday. “We talked to them and said he should rest as they were just friendlies. But they played him twice, every single minute. That's a little bit disappointing. On the other side, we've tried to manage his minutes here, resting him against AEK Larnaca, but you can't cheat your body.”

Palace are back in action at Selhurst Park on Thursday against Dutch side AZ. Glasner's squad selections indicate he is taking the competition very seriously, so it would not be a surprise to see him pick a full-strength squad again. And with a home tie against rivals Brighton & Hove Albion on Sunday, there's little chance of Richards being rested on the weekend.

But with Richards in such impressive form, you can hardly blame USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino. Richards will undoubtedly be a key part of the squad next summer.

Despite playing under another new club manager in Luciano Spalletti, Weston McKennie continues to be one of Serie A's most impressive utility men, playing 85 minutes as a quasi-right-winger in Juventus' 2-1 win against Cremonese.

He was his typical industrious self without possession, winning two tackles and making four recoveries. But he also showed his attacking qualities, creating two chances with an expected assists tally of 0.72. Alongside his sole shot — a close-range effort that flew past the post — the data suggests he may have contributed to a goal on the day, with his combined expected goals and assists tally at 1.0.

Christian Pulisic was absent for the fourth game running for Milan after sustaining a hamstring injury on international duty last month, but he is ex for Milan's next league fixture on November 8.

“Pulisic should return against Parma,” said Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri. “Let's see if Pulisic will be back in Parma and then join his national team… We are in contact with all the national team coaches to tell them our players' conditions.”

In Scotland, Auston Trusty did his chances of becoming an established Celtic starter no harm as his side beat Rangers 3-1 in the semi-final of the Scottish League Cup (known as the Premier Sports Cup). Trusty even registered an assist in the Old Firm, one of the world's most famous and hotly contested derby matches.

Goalkeeping hopeful Ethan Horvath had one of the finest displays of the weekend, keeping a clean sheet for Sheffield Wednesday in a 0-0 draw at The Hawthorns against a much-fancied West Bromwich Albion. He's had a challenging start to the season, with Wednesday sitting at the bottom of the table on minus five points after suffering a 12-point deduction for entering administration. Daryl Dike came on for the home side in the 90th minute, but was unable to make much of an impression with his limited time on the field.

Elsewhere in the Championship, Haji Wright was quiet as Coventry suffered their first loss of the league season, falling 3-2 to Wrexham. Josh Sargent couldn't break his goalscoring duck as Norwich City were beaten 2-0 by Hull City, and Aidan Morris made a limited impact in Middlesbrough's 3-0 defeat to Watford.

Damion Downs will be playing under a new head coach, with Southampton calling time on Will Still's disastrous tenure at the helm after a 2-0 away defeat to Preston, which leaves them 21st in the Championship table.

In more positive news, Patrick Agyemang proved an excellent foil for hat-trick hero Carlton Morris as Derby County dispatched Sheffield United, and USMNT-eligible Charlie Kelman scored his first goal of the season in Charlton Athletic's 1-1 draw with Swansea City.

McKennie will be hoping his Juventus side can earn their first win of this season's Champions League against Portugal's Sporting CP tomorrow, available on ESPN3 and Paramount+.

Sergino Dest's PSV and Folarin Balogun's Monaco will also be in action in the Champions League on Tuesday, where they will face Olympiacos and Bodo/Glimt. These matches will also be available on Paramount+.

There are just over 200 days to go until the U.S. men's national team laces up and hits the pitch for the opening game of the 2026 FIFA World Cup at SoFi Stadium.

With the pressing issues of form and fitness, and a desire to crack head coach Mauricio Pochettino's 26-player roster, each match at club level is critical for every player as they look towards their ultimate goal of representing the country. 

A number of high-profile players were in action, but it was actually those who are on the periphery who stood up to be counted as the calendar flipped over until November. 

Here's Sports Illustrated's top five USMNT performances of the week.

Pochettino has largely overlooked Joe Scally, but the man with 21 USMNT caps helped Borussia Mönchengladbach keep a clean sheet in a 4–0 win over FC St. Pauli in Bundesliga action. Scally played all 90 minutes as a right wingback and got forward to fire a shot off the post, while also chipping in with seven defensive contributions.With the shift to a back three for the USMNT, a prolonged period of good form as a right wingback could put him back into the running for a 2026 World Cup roster spot.

Ricardo Pepi kept up his strong form in the Eredivisie with a goal in a 5–2 win over Fortuna Sittard, his fourth of the season, to help PSV Eindhoven to second in the league table. While the former FC Dallas standout didn't start the match, he made quick work off the bench after entering in the 60th minute. Outside of the goal, he completed all 10 of his attempted passes and had 15 touches as an impactful substitute. The worry for Pepi, though, is the lack of starts. PSV have leaned on Guus Til and Ismael Saibari to lead the attack, and both hit the scoresheet in the win as well. However, after the game, manager Peter Bosz reiterated that Pepi is his top choice, but has been held out due to the team's success.

It hasn't been a stellar 2025–26 campaign for either Celtic or Rangers, with both changing managers in the blink of an eye. But despite their respective struggles, the Old Firm remains one of the world's most intense derbies, and an American defender was in the thick of it all on Sunday afternoon. Auston Trusty, who has largely been left out of the USMNT under Pochettino, helped Celtic to a 3–1 win over Rangers in the Scottish League Cup semifinal, putting up an assist in the 120-minute effort after the game ended 1–1 after 90 minutes. The 27-year-old only returned to action midweek after recovering from a foot injury, and stood out in the semifinal, earning the club's Player of the Match award. 

Tyler Adams isn't known for scoring goals. Yet, he bagged his first goal since 2021, and the first of his in the Premier League, in AFC Bournemouth's 3–1 loss to Manchester City on Sunday. The goal came in his 65th Premier League appearance, and was just the seventh goal of his professional career, with three of those seven coming with New York Red Bulls II in the USL Championship. While the Cherries weren't able to pull out a positive result at the Etihad Stadium, Adams had a career moment to remember. However, he had to come out in the 80th minute with what looked to be a minor knee injury after receiving treatment on the field.

While players in Europe will play right through to the summer, the 2025 MLS Cup playoffs are vital to the American players playing on home soil. Any players eliminated won't have any club matches until the season starts up again in February, missing out on time to find form ahead of the World Cup. Max Arfsten and the Columbus Crew faced that issue on Sunday night, sitting on the brink of elimination after losing Game 1 of their first-round best-of-three series against Hell is Real rivals FC Cincinnati. Yet, Arfsten and his side stepped up, with the American netting the opening and eventual winning goal in a 4–0 victory, which forced a decisive Game 3 in one of the league's most heated rivalries. In addition to his goal, he also had an assist, eight completed dribbles, and created four chances, earning him Player of the Match honors. Game 3 of the series is set for Nov. 8 at FC Cincinnati's TQL Stadium.

Carlo Ancelotti has conquered everything club football has to offer but his biggest dream now lies on the world stage. As Brazil's head coach, the Italian tactician is chasing the one title missing from his glittering resume, the FIFA World Cup. With the 2026 tournament looming, Ancelotti's mission is as emotional as it is historic, to end Brazil's 24-year drought and perhaps, face his homeland, Italy, in the final.

When Ancelotti left Real Madrid after guiding them to yet another Champions League crown in 2024, few could have predicted his next destination. Yet, for the man who has lifted 29 major trophies across Europe, the allure of leading the world's most successful footballing nation proved irresistible.

“Managing the Brazilian national team - the most successful in history - was an opportunity I couldn't refuse,” Ancelotti said when asked earlier why he chose to take up the role of Selcao's head coach. “I knew about the passion here, but living it is different. When Brazil play, the country stops.""

Appointed in mid-2024, Ancelotti's arrival marked a new era for the Selecao. By June 2025, he had guided Brazil to World Cup qualification, sealing the spot with a narrow 1-0 win over Paraguay thanks to Vinicius Jr.'s strike. His record of two wins, one draw, and one loss in his first four games reflected a pragmatic approach built on defensive solidity and tactical discipline, qualities Brazil had been missing in recent years.

Ancelotti's Brazil is not about flamboyance alone; it's about control. Known for his calm leadership and man-management, he has tried to mould a side that balances flair with efficiency. “We want to win, and we're not hiding it,” he declared. “The dream is for Brazil to win their sixth World Cup. There are great expectations, but also great enthusiasm. The fact that we haven't won in 24 years is a burden. Let's hope it doesn't become 28!,” Ancelotti said in an interview with Dribbling on Rai Due.

His selections have sparked debate. Neymar's absence due to long-term injury, along with the temporary exclusions of Vinicius and Rodrygo, raised eyebrows. But Ancelotti was clear: fitness, form, and balance come before fame. “It's important to know every player personally,” he explained after calling up several fresh faces like Caio Henrique and Kaio Jorge during 2025 qualifiers.

Yet, not everyone is convinced. Former Brazil goalkeeper and manager Emerson Leao criticised Ancelotti's appointment, calling it “a sad reflection” of the state of Brazilian coaching. “I'm disappointed that a foreigner had to come because our own coaches haven't delivered,” Leao told CNN. “Managing Brazil is much harder than managing Real Madrid - here, an entire nation judges you.”

He questioned Ancelotti's familiarity with domestic talent and communication style, warning that “his work will be very difficult.” The criticism underscores the immense scrutiny that comes with the Brazil job - where every lineup choice becomes a national debate and every result, a referendum.

Ancelotti, however, remains unfazed. Having succeeded under the most intense club pressures, he knows how to shield his players. “I focus on preparation, unity, and belief,” he said in a press-conference. “The World Cup will be competitive, but our goal is clear.”

For all his trophies with league titles in Italy, England, France, Germany, and Spain, plus a record five Champions Leagues, Ancelotti's heart still beats for the game's most poetic moments. And his dream is deeply personal.

“I would like a final between Brazil and Italy,” he admitted in an interview. “It would be beautiful for me on an emotional level.”

The image of Ancelotti leading Brazil and perhaps against his homeland in the 2026 World Cup final is the stuff of cinematic drama. For Brazil, it's a chance to end 24 years of frustration; for Ancelotti, a chance to achieve what no foreign manager ever has, winning the World Cup with the Selecao.

“I've won everything else. But the dream is to make Brazil world champions again,” he said during an interview with FIFA.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

This article was updated on 3 November with information on FIFA World Cup 2026 ticket prices

The 2026 FIFA World Cup, kicking off June 11 across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, will feature 48 teams in 104 matches over 39 days, coinciding with America's 250th anniversary. While the event was expected to spark surging hotel demand in host cities, its impact has so far fallen short of expectations, more so in the United States to date, especially as prices for U.S. World Cup tickets are significantly more expensive than in Canada and Mexico.

Tighter borders, trade tensions, and stricter visa requirements are driving a decline in U.S. tourism, affecting sectors ranging from hospitality to construction. With major ticket sales still ahead for FIFA 2026, the U.S. trails its World Cup co-hosts in year-over-year growth in hotel rates.

Experts point to several factors behind the slowdown, but with nine months remaining, the U.S. hotel industry could see a sharp rebound in bookings after the final draw and full match schedule are released on December 5.

Hospitality data firm Lighthouse reports that length-of-stay rules have limited hotel inventory for FIFA 2026, with occupancy in most host cities still in single digits, nine months before the event. The U.S. also shows the slowest room rate growth during the tournament, with Mexico leading the surge, followed closely by Canada.

Despite differing price surges across regions, average room rates remain well above typical 2026 levels and higher than the same period in 2025, signaling what Lighthouse calls a “clear anticipation of future demand.”

""When viewed in context, current booking levels are higher than normal for this time of year, but still far below what a World Cup host market would typically expect,"" the report states.

The report attributes the slower growth in room rates in the U.S. to a combination of structural and cultural factors. Canada and Mexico have smaller hotel inventories, and Mexico's strong soccer culture has fueled earlier demand.

There is also a projected dip in international travel spending in the U.S. for 2025, with more restrictive visa conditions and tighter border procedures.

For hotels in U.S. host cities, the FIFA World Cup has driven aggressive pricing strategies and heightened expectations, with year-over-year rate growth outpacing the national average. The tournament's impact is evident, just not as pronounced as many anticipated.

The rest of the U.S. during the weeks of competition

3%

U.S. host cities during the weeks of No competition

6%

The rest of the U.S. during the weeks of No competition

The report indicates that, while current booking levels exceed typical figures for this time of year, they remain significantly below what's expected for a World Cup host market. The most substantial uptick is seen in the opening two weeks of the group stage, when occupancy nearly doubles amid peak fan interest.

FIFA announced earlier this month that over a million tickets have been sold out of an estimated 7.1 million. With roughly six million tickets, about 85%, still available, and several factors weighing on early demand, the main hotel booking surge, particularly in the U.S., is yet to come.

The report also notes that many hotels appear unavailable during the tournament, either due to length-of-stay restrictions or withheld inventory.

 With both hotels and fans ""on pause"" until the final ticket draw on December 5, a surge in bookings is expected once fans learn where their teams will play.

“Many hotels are holding back inventory and setting minimum-stay requirements in anticipation of higher-value bookings later,” the report also said.

Despite a slow start in bookings, average hotel rates across North America, including the U.S., for the World Cup period remain well above typical 2026 levels and higher than the same dates in 2025. On the other hand, FIFA's ticket prices have been causing a stir since they were announced, with some fans believing the U.S. is pricing itself out of travelers' radars.

FIFA has also announced that its resale site is now open, and tickets for the World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey, are available on the FIFA website at prices ranging from $9,538 to $57,500 per seat. However, the difference in price between U.S. World Cup tickets and those in Canada and Mexico has many fans noticing. Tickets for the U.S. are more expensive when averaged out, which may also be driving away some travelers to America's neighboring co-host nations instead.

Granted, that may well be because there are more soccer matches in the U.S., but the price comparison for the opening games shows a large difference in cost. These prices, seen below, are for Category 4 tickets, which are the cheapest tickets available for the opening matches.

Below are each host country's average group stage ticket prices for further comparison.

All in all, fans heading to the U.S. for the FIFA World Cup in 2026 will have to put their hands deeper into their pockets. Whether or not these prices will actually steer travelers away (and potentially have a knock-on effect on the U.S. hotel industry) is yet to be seen.

I expect the US is suffering from the continuing Global boycott. Especially for 2026 - the US anniversary has absolutely nothing to do with the World Cup Football championship games. Only trump would try to tie in these two events - for his own purpose of course.

This has to be the most boring sport in all the world. Watching most games for 3 hours is awful, but I know it is accepted worldwide, other than the USA. Just MHO.

No, baseball is FAR more boring and who needs 6-1/2 hour games?

Brent Brilliant response for something that happened 1 time in many many years. This World series was exceptional.

Brent Baseball and chezz are boring as hell, not action and too much stoppage, no wonder is the sport where you see the most people sleeping in the stadium, even their own fans who go there because they like that sport fall of sleep! LOL

Your sports are akin to rugby for girls, netball and what we call rounders. They're all designed for fat people on sofas.



I'd be happy if you never got a chance to host a World Cup again, you don't deserve it.

Everyone shjould boycott the US. There's a good chance they'll be denied entry or arrested by ICE and deported.

L-R: One of Liam Kelly, Scott Bain and Craig Gordon will start in goal for Scotland

Manager Steve Clarke has played down Scotland's goalkeeping crisis and is intent on setting up a ""cup final"" against Denmark in the second of this month's pivotal World Cup qualifiers.

Angus Gunn, who has started all four qualifiers, is missing through injury so Falkirk's Scott Bain - the 33-year-old who won the last of his three caps in San Marino in 2019 - returns for the games against against Greece and Denmark.

Clarke's choice in goal will be between Bain, Liam Kelly - who has made one League Cup appearance for Rangers this term - and Craig Gordon, who will be 43 next month and has not played at all this season.  

Scotland are second in Group C after three wins and a draw and have already secured at least a place in the World Cup play-offs in March.

They are likely to need at least a point in Greece on 15 November to set up a winner-takes-all showdown at Hampden against Denmark three days later, given the group leaders have a superior goal difference and face bottom side Belarus next.

""We're in a good position. What we have to do is make sure we get the result we need in Greece to make the Denmark game a cup final,"" said Clarke.

""It's always a blow when somebody misses out with injury and Angus did well in the four games up until now.

""We were in the same position in September, when Angus hadn't been playing either. With goalkeepers, it's a different position.  

""Quite often they're the number two or the number three with their clubs. As long you've got boys who train well, goalkeepers can be out of the team for a long time and when they're asked to go in, they'll be ready.""

In-form Heart of Midlothian striker Lawrence Shankland has also been recalled and Clarke says ""if you need goals, Lawrence is your man"".

The 30-year-old last featured for Scotland in the Nations League victory over Poland 12 months ago but returns along with defenders Ross McCrorie and Josh Doig as Scotland seek to reach the World Cup finals for the first time since 1998.

Goalkeepers: Scott Bain (Falkirk), Craig Gordon (Heart of Midlothian), Liam Kelly (Rangers)

Defenders: Josh Doig (Sassuolo), Grant Hanley (Hibernian), Jack Hendry (Al-Etiffaq), Aaron Hickey (Brentford), Ross McCrorie (Bristol City), Scott McKenna (Dinamo Zagreb), Anthony Ralston (Celtic), Andy Robertson (Liverpool), John Souttar (Rangers), Kieran Tierney (Celtic)

Midfielders: Ryan Christie (Bournemouth), Lewis Ferguson (Bologna), Ben Gannon-Doak (Bournemouth), Billy Gilmour (Napoli), John McGinn (Aston Villa), Kenny McLean (Norwich City), Scott McTominay (Napoli), Lennon Miller (Udinese)

Forwards: Che Adams (Torino), Lyndon Dykes (Birmingham City), George Hirst (Ipswich Town), Lawrence Shankland (Heart of Midlothian)

Kieron Bowie of Hibernian misses out to make room for Shankland's return, with Che Adams of Torino, Birmingham City's Lyndon Dykes and George Hirst of Ipswich Town the other strikers in the squad.

Shankland has formed a fine partnership up front for Hearts with new signing Claudio Braga this season, with his goal in Saturday's 4-0 demolition of Dundee taking him top of the domestic scoring charts.

Bristol City's McCrorie, who made his sole Scotland appearance against Gibraltar last year, returns to provide additional cover at right-back, with Aaron Hickey only just back from the injury he sustained during the last international window.

Derby County's Max Johnston has been ruled out for up to eight weeks with a hamstring injury while Nathan Patterson of Everton needs a hernia operation.

Sassuolo's Doig - one of six Serie A-based players named in the 25-man pool - missed out on the October squad but was a part of the group in September and will vie for the left-back position with captain Andy Robertson and Kieran Tierney.

The eight midfielders named by Clarke are the same as those in the squad for the hard-working victories against Greece and Belarus in October.

Billy Gilmour came off after 38 minutes of Napoli's 0-0 draw with Como at the weekend but takes his place in the squad alongside club-mate Scott McTominay.

Lawrence Shankland tops the Scottish Premiership goalscoring chart this season with seven for leaders Hearts

Clarke has rewarded Shankland for a stunning start to the season that has the Hearts captain already on 10 goals.

""Lawrence has been good. He's hit the ground running again this season, his team are flying at the top of the league,"" he added. 

""Lawrence is getting his goals. If you need someone in the squad for goals, Lawrence is your man.

""In these two games coming up we're going to need experienced players and Lawrence has certainly got that experience to help us. 

""I have a good relationship with most of my players. We are always very honest with each other. He's a striker who lives on goals, thrives on goals. 

""He's in a good place and when you've got a striker in a good place scoring goals, it's important to get them involved.""

Fans have been flocking to soccer matches in Jalisco, Mexico, as authorities fine-tune security for the 2026 FIFA World Cup

GUADALAJARA, Mexico -- Fans flocking to a soccer match in Zapopan chanted “Mexico! Mexico!” while walking past dozens of police officers, bomb-sniffing dogs, metal detectors and drone jammers — as authorities fine-tuned security ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. A few miles away, south of Guadalajara, a different sort of deployment was underway: National Guard troops stood sentry as volunteers dug up the small patio of an abandoned house looking for some of Mexico's 134,000 disappeared.

It's a jarring contrast especially present in Jalisco, where 48,000-seat soccer stadiums and fan zones — like the site of the Oct. 14 friendly match between Mexico and Ecuador — coexist with one of the world's most powerful criminal organizations. The state — which will host four World Cup matches in June 2026 — is home to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, arguably Mexico's most powerful with an estimated 19,000 members and operations spanning 21 of Mexico's 32 states.

With a population of 8 million, Jalisco leads in disappearances and is among Mexico's top four states for crime rate. As of October, the state had reported approximately 1,000 disappearances — a 30% surge compared to the same period the previous year, according to Mexico's National Search Commission.

Yet, neither the soccer fans attending the recent soccer match, nor the officials securing the site expressed concern about hosting an international sporting event on the home turf of the Jalisco cartel. The reasons offered varied, spanning the notion of a temporary, tacit truce between criminals and the government, to the inherent security boost that such major events provide.

“If you don't get yourself into trouble, nothing will happen,” said Javier Rodríguez, an 18-year-old college student on his way to the stadium.

South of Guadalajara, off the highway that leads to the snowbird destination of Lake Chapala, Indira Navarro and a group of volunteers dug up the concrete slab behind an abandoned house following a tip that human remains were buried there.

They're members of the Jalisco Search Warriors, one of many volunteer groups across Mexico who spend their free time searching for the missing, hoping to find their own relatives or bring closure to another family.

They didn't find anything that morning. However, earlier this year the team searched a ranch near Guadalajara — a site authorities raided the prior year — unearthing hundreds of garments and burned bone fragments that left authorities scrambling to explain why the initial investigation of the purported cartel recruitment and training site had been so shoddy.

Navarro is searching for her brother who disappeared in the neighboring state of Sonora in 2015. Since March, she has lived with round-the-clock protection of the National Guard because of the death threats she received after publicizing the group's discovery at the ranch.

The Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which the Trump administration designated a foreign terrorist organization earlier this year, has established itself as Mexico's most powerful criminal organization. It earned its reputation through bold attacks on authorities, such as downing a Mexican military helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade and attempting a spectacular ambush of a Mexico City police chief in 2020.

Experts say there has not been a criminal organization so powerful in Jalisco since the late 1980s, the last time Guadalajara hosted international matches during the 1986 World Cup.

Roberto Alarcón, Jalisco's state security strategy coordinator, downplayed the local cartel's presence while simultaneously suggesting that their dominance actually makes security efforts easier.

“Not having a great number of criminal groups like other states allows … security authorities to attack these groups in a better, more controlled way,"" said Alarcón, adding that all major crimes in the state are, in fact, trending downward.

Security analyst David Saucedo expects to see a tacit agreement between the cartel and the government, in which security forces would hold off on operations to capture cartel leaders, provided the cartel avoids any high-profile actions.

“I think both sides will agree to a truce that, obviously, might not last very long,"" Saucedo said. “But I think it's convenient for everyone.”

He warns, however, that such a truce will not mean the cartel will stop committing crimes. 

Organized crime, he said, will take advantage of the World Cup to “increase its criminal activity” in casinos, street-level drug sales, sexual tourism and reselling tickets, he said. “I think they're going to enjoy the World Cup themselves.”

A day before the Oct. 14 friendly match, Jalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus, local politicians and soccer federation officials spoke to the media about the investments being made ahead of the World Cup and the advantages of having Jalisco as a host. Security concerns and preparedness were notably absent from the discussion.

Jalisco officials say the 2026 World Cup is expected to generate $1 billion in revenues for the state and create up to 7,000 jobs, primarily in the tourism and construction sectors, as the area rushes to add 12,000 new hotel rooms before the tournament.

“The 2026 World Cup is a great opportunity for Jalisco to position itself before the world,” Lemus told reporters.

The following night, Johana Jaramillo, a 42-year-old event producer working at a fan zone outside the stadium, confronted the stark paradox of hosting a major international event in a place so steeped in suffering.

“These events help slightly repair social pain and bring the opportunity for better security measures simply because so many people are attending,” she said.

In addition to drone jammers and armored vehicles, Jalisco is installing 3,000 additional surveillance cameras, pushing the state's total past 10,000, a legacy of the World Cup that could continue to benefit residents after the tournament ends.

But for those like Navarro, who have dedicated their lives to searching for loved ones with little help from authorities, the World Cup hype feels like whitewashing Jalisco's violence. 

“They want to wash away everything that has to do with the issue of the disappeared,"" she said. ""But they won't be able to do so because we're going to continue fighting.”

Steve Clarke's side are away to Greece on November 15 and then face Denmark at Hampden Park three days later; wins over Greece and Belarus last month helped secure a play-off spot; Scotland will qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1998 if they draw in Greece and beat Denmark

Monday 3 November 2025 13:41, UK

Scotland head coach Steve Clarke has recalled four players to his squad for the decisive World Cup qualifiers against Greece and Denmark.

Falkirk goalkeeper Scott Bain - who made the last of his three appearances for the national side in March 2019 against San Marino - is included in place of No 1 Angus Gunn.

Nottingham Forest's Gunn - who had started all of Scotland's four previous qualifiers - has suffered a knee ligament injury, with Craig Gordon, 42, and Rangers' Liam Kelly the other goalkeeping options for Clarke.

At the other end of the pitch, Gordon's Hearts team-mate Lawrence Shankland returns in place of Hibernian forward Kieron Bowie.

Shankland has scored three goals in his last three games, taking his tally to seven for the season, helping fire Hearts to the top of the Scottish Premiership.

Elsewhere, Clarke has added to his defensive options by recalling Sassuolo left-back Josh Doig following his omission from the October squad.

Meanwhile, Bristol City's Ross McCrorie will hope to make his first Scotland appearance in over a year after also being added to a larger 25-player group.

Elsewhere, Clarke is hopeful Aaron Hickey will feature for Brentford in the coming week after recovering from an injury that has kept him sidelined since early October.

Meanwhile, in an unchanged midfield, Billy Gilmour is expected to be fit despite coming off injured during Napoli's draw with Como at the weekend.

With a World Cup play-off spot already secured, Clarke's side head to Greece on November 15 before welcoming Group C leaders Denmark to Hampden Park three days later in a potential winner-takes-all clash.

Denmark have a better goal difference and face Belarus next, so Scotland will likely need to pick up at least a draw in Greece before beating Denmark at the national stadium if they're to secure automatic qualification to the finals for the first time since 1998.

""We all need to remind ourselves that we would have been delighted to be in this position, coming into the last two of the qualifying campaign, having already eliminated one of the major threats in Greece,"" Clarke said.

""They [Greece] can't be involved in the play-offs or the shake-up for first place, but that doesn't mean to say it's not going to be a difficult game in Greece, because I'm sure they'll be fired up to prove that they're better than Scotland.

""We're in a good position. What we have to do is make sure we get the result we need in Greece to make the Denmark game here a cup final.""

Goalkeepers: Scott Bain (Falkirk), Craig Gordon (Hearts), Liam Kelly (Rangers).

Defenders: Josh Doig (Sassuolo), Grant Hanley (Hibernian), Jack Hendry (Al Etiffaq), Aaron Hickey (Brentford), Ross McCrorie (Bristol City), Scott McKenna (Dinamo Zagreb), Anthony Ralston (Celtic), Andy Robertson (Liverpool), John Souttar (Rangers), Kieran Tierney (Celtic).

Midfielders: Ryan Christie (Bournemouth), Lewis Ferguson (Bologna), Ben Gannon Doak (Bournemouth), Billy Gilmour (Napoli), John McGinn (Aston Villa), Kenny McLean (Norwich), Scott McTominay (Napoli), Lennon Miller (Udinese).

Forwards: Che Adams (Torino), Lyndon Dykes (Birmingham), George Hirst (Ipswich), Lawrence Shankland (Hearts).

Scotland picked up four points from their opening two qualifiers, drawing away to top-seeds Denmark, before beating Belarus 2-0 to end September joint-top of the table.

Next up was a Hampden Park double header in which all six points were claimed.

Clarke's side did it the hard way, as they came from behind to beat Greece 3-1, before a 2-1 win over Belarus helped secure a play-off spot.

That victory over Belarus saw Clarke take charge of a record-breaking 72nd game as national team boss, but afterwards he described the performance as a ""head-scratcher"", before adding it was ""possibly as disappointed as I've been over the whole 72 games"".

However, Clarke did promise ""a different animal"" for these final two games against the already eliminated Greece and group leaders Denmark.

A play-off spot is secured, but two more wins will seal a return to the World Cup for the first time since 1998. Scotland and Clarke are on the brink of making history.

In total, 16 UEFA nations will qualify for the 2026 World Cup. The 12 group winners qualify directly for the World Cup; the four remaining berths are determined by play-offs involving the 12 group runners-up.

The 12 group runners-up will participate in the play-offs, along with the four best-ranked group winners of the 2024/25 UEFA Nations League that did not finish their European Qualifiers group stage in first or second place.

The 16 teams that enter the play-offs will be drawn into four play-off paths, with four teams in each. Play-off matches will be played in single-leg semi-finals, followed by single-leg finals within the same international window in from March 26 to 31 next year.

The 2026 FIFA men's World Cup takes place from June 11 to July 19, 2026.

The tournament will take place across 16 cities in three North American countries: the United States, Canada and Mexico. It is the first time a World Cup has been hosted by three nations.

The last time North America hosted the tournament was in 1994, when Brazil triumphed after beating Italy on penalties.

An expanded World Cup will feature 48 teams - 16 more than in Qatar 2022 - and take place across three host nations for the first time.

Group stage: June 11-27Round of 32: June 28 to July 3Round of 16: July 4-7Quarter-finals: July 9-11Semi-finals: July 14-15Third-place play-off ('Bronze final'): July 18Final: July 19

Arsenal determined to hand star winger new contract that includes 'record-breaking' pay rise amid transfer fear","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/bukayo-saka-arsenal-determined-winger-new-contract-record-breaking-pay-rise/blt0944c65e94efeb1e","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 12:52:52 GMT","

Arsenal are determined to hand star winger Bukayo Saka a new contract, with the England international set for a massive pay hike. After tying down William Saliba to a long-term deal, the Gunners have now shifted their focus to Saka and want to wrap up contract talks as early as possible amid fears that the wide man could draw transfer interest in the future.

Arsenal spent heavily in the summer transfer window to rebuild their squad as they brought in as many as eight new players. The Gunners' outlay has had an impact already as they have won eight out of their first 10 Premier League games and are being considered as early favourites to win the league title. 

However, new sporting director Andrea Berta had mentioned that retaining existing key squad members on a long-term basis continues to remain the club's top priority. In the past few months, they have extended the deals of Gabriel, Ethan Nwaneri, William Saliba and Myles Lewis-Skelly and are now hoping Saka agrees to their offer.

Per Sky Sports, Arsenal have met Saka's representatives on multiple occasions in recent times, which has made it clear that the Gunners are determined to retain their star player. The Premier League leaders want to wrap up the process as early as possible amid fears of transfer interest from across Europe. The club want to tie down Saka until the summer of 2030 and are planning to offer wages in the region of £12 million ($16m) gross per season.

The report adds that Saka's renewal will reflect owner Stan Kroenke's confidence in the player and will also send a message to other clubs that Arsenal can hold onto their star players. The Gunners remain confident that Saka will agree on the new deal.

In a recent interview, Saka expressed his confidence in Arsenal winning the Premier League this season, as she said: ""This year, I feel we're a very strong group and we've got a lot of quality. We've already suffered a lot of injuries, but you know, the players that have come in have shown that we can all keep the level at the top at the highest. That's what it's going to take for us to go all the way. I think that's where we've slipped off in a few seasons, but this season, I think we've got that. And you know, it's making me really believe we can do it.""

Mikel Arteta's side, who have won eight out of their first 10 league matches, have been hailed as favourites to lift the trophy in May. As by far the most consistent side in the division so far, the Gunners have been told the trophy is theirs to lose, although there is one club who could challenge them.

Speaking on his self-titled podcast, ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville said: ""This has got to be them, hasn't it? This has got to be their year. This is the fourth season on the bounce that I've had them to win the league, but they're not necessarily miles better, they're repeating their levels of consistency, and that's all they're going to have to do this year to win the league. They're not going to have to go and get 100 points, they're not going to have to get even 90 or 95 points to win the league, mid-80s, high 80s will win them this title, and they can do that.""

He added: ""The reason I say I'm confident Arsenal will win the league is because you always think about what can stop a team. If Liverpool lost Virgil van Dijk or Mohamed Salah in previous seasons they would be in trouble. But I can't think of any player Arsenal might lose now and it would mean they would lose the title…even the two centre-backs because of the summer signings. Every position is covered. Bukayo Saka was that player in the past but Noni Madueke came in when he was injured. Everywhere, they are properly doubled up with the same level of quality or only a small drop-off. So who's going to take it off them? Arsenal would have to beat themselves not to win it. I don't think Man City are going to get back to a level they've been at previously and come back at Arsenal. Pep Guardiola is a genius but he hasn't got the players or the team playing at the level needed. Liverpool are the only team but they would have to get back on track very quickly.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Inter Miami told how to 'limit the risks' as 'pros and cons' of stunning deal for MLS are weighed up","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/neymar-lionel-messi-reunion-inter-miami-mls/bltd0422118b8a75276","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 14:31:17 GMT","

Former USMNT star Brad Friedel has told GOAL how Inter Miami could “limit the risks” involved in a deal that would see Neymar reunited with Lionel Messi. The ex-Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain forward is seeing a move to MLS speculated on. Neymar will become a free agent at the end of the year, as his contract in Brazil with Santos runs down, meaning that a new challenge in North America could be sought.

Neymar returned to his roots in January after seeing a lucrative contract in the Saudi Pro League with Al-Hilal torn up. A forgettable spell in the Middle East was brought to a close after recovering from a serious knee ligament injury.

More fitness issues have been endured back in his homeland, with Brazil's all-time leading goal-scorer now 33 years of age. He remains eager to represent his country at next summer's World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico, however. Regular game will be required in order to earn a call-up from Selecao boss Carlo Ancelotti.

A return to Europe has been ruled out, following surprising links to Serie A giants Inter, with an extended stay at Santos or a fresh start alongside Messi in Miami considered to be the only options available to Neymar.

Designated player spots will be opening up in Florida as Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba prepare to retire, meaning that another Barcelona legend could be acquired. Inter Miami would, however, be taking a serious punt on Neymar.

Asked how big that gamble would be and where value can be found, Friedel - speaking in association with Hard Rock Bet - told GOAL: “I think it would be a risk on anyone's behalf; I think it just depends on how you would structure the contract. You also have to weigh the pros and cons — when you sign legends of the game like Neymar, you also have to take into account the commercial opportunities that go with it, and it coincides nearly every time with the salary and wage packet that you are going to give.

“You are going to make a substantial amount of money off the field when you bring someone like that in. I think there is probably more of a sporting risk than a commercial risk — or equally so if he does get injured. But if he doesn't get injured, the risk becomes his age and the injuries he has had, and whether he can be that player [they need].

“The plus side is, it is a league that is a step down from where he is playing. Lionel Messi is the greatest of all time, but he can play many more years in MLS. It is a league that will allow players to do that, so I think Inter Miami need to weigh the pros and cons of what they can earn off the field and try to get it correct.

“If they can structure the contract correctly, then it limits the risk. Having Neymar alongside Messi again — I am not sure. We will wait and see, but the league needs to do something commercially.

“The TV contract needs to be bigger within the MLS to make sure the league can be profitable, because the way it is set up, it is not. Bringing in the likes of Thomas Muller at Vancouver — look at what it has done for them. Again, I don't know if it has impacted them commercially in a positive way, but the MLS has to do something, and Neymar would be another step in the right direction.”

Neymar has previously left the door open to playing alongside Messi and Luis Suarez, saying it would be “incredible” to revive their ‘MSN' strike partnership. Friedel, though, is not convinced that veteran Uruguayan striker Suarez has another season left in him.

The ex-Tottenham and Blackburn goalkeeper, who has worked in MLS with the Columbus Crew and New England Revolution, added on 38-year-old Suarez: “I am not in or around his group to know, but I have played against him many times, and when you watch him run — I don't know if it is his ankles or his knees — but it is getting to the end for him, so I don't know if he can do another year even if he wants to. I would not be surprised when he does say that he will be retiring.”

Suarez has stated in the past that he wants to retire at the same time as Messi, but that dream appears to have faded after seeing the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner commit to a new three-year contract through 2028. Inter Miami are currently chasing down MLS Cup glory, with their first round playoff clash with Nashville heading to a decider at Chase Stadium on Saturday.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","From hero to villain: Lionesses icon Mary Earps souring England legacy with shocking criticism of Hannah Hampton and Sarina Wiegman","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/lionesses-icon-mary-earps-souring-england-legacy-hannah-hampton-sarina-wiegman/blt44e5ed452fdda729","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 17:24:42 GMT","

It's crazy how quickly things can change in football. Mary Earps, who has made plenty of headlines this past week ahead of the release of her book 'All In', is a prime example of as much. Only six months ago, the goalkeeper stood tall as a true England hero, having delivered world-class performances in the Lionesses' 2022 European Championship triumph and their run to the 2023 Women's World Cup final. Recent events, however, have seen Earps veer more towards villain territory than anything else.

That England's No.1 shirt started to slip out of her hands last year had no negative impact on her iconic status. Change is natural in football and that was especially, and unsurprisingly, the case here, in a situation where Earps had an uber-talented young shot-stopper by the name of Hannah Hampton charging up behind her. It didn't alter the way England fans thought about the player who was so instrumental in such incredible success, not in terms of her legacy and influence.

It is instead how Earps has reacted to relinquishing her position as the Lionesses' first-choice goalkeeper, first with the manner of her international retirement back in May and now her stunning comments towards Hampton and England boss Sarina Wiegman, that is changing the public's perception of her for the worse. Indeed, one of the most common takes over the past few days is that Earps has tarnished her Lionesses legacy with her recent comments - and it's hard to disagree.

The most headline-grabbing topic from Earps' book, and subsequent interviews, has been Hampton, who usurped her to become England's No.1 ahead of Euro 2025. After Euro 2022, Hampton was dropped from the England squad by Wiegman, with the Guardian citing 'her behaviour and attitude at the team's camps' as the reason. It's something Earps has referred to again in her book, claiming that ""bad behaviour"" was ""rewarded"" when Wiegman decided to bring Hampton back into camps a few months later, despite the England boss explaining that the goalkeeper had ""sorted out"" the ""personal issues"" that had kept her away.

At the time she was left out of the Lionesses' squad, Hampton was 21 years old. It's clear that she went away and addressed whatever the issue was enough to satisfy not only Wiegman - an incredibly successful manager who it's hard to believe would stand for any sort of disruptive behaviour - but also Emma Hayes, who signed her to be Chelsea's No.1 not long after.

""The only thing I want to say about Hannah is that, since I joined Chelsea, she has grown so much,"" Sonia Bompastor, Hayes' successor, said on Saturday when asked about Earps' comments. ""She's such a professional athlete and also a good person. We have a really good relationship together and I want to show her my support in this situation. If you look at what Hannah said in the previous comments about Mary Earps then what Mary is saying about her now, one of them is class - and Hannah is the class one.""

Wiegman, Hayes and Bompastor are three of the most successful and well-respected coaches of this era. It's hard to believe that any of them - never mind all three of them - would have Hampton as their first-choice goalkeeper if she was disruptive and detrimental to an environment. It's also worth noting that when asked for specific examples of Hampton's 'bad behaviour' in an interview with the Guardian, Earps said: ""I don't want to go into the specifics because it's not my place.""

When talking about positive comments about Earps made by Hampton, Bompastor was referring to an interview with Glamour earlier in the week, in which Hampton spoke about being on stage alongside Earps to receive the first-ever Women's Yashin Trophy at the Ballon d'Or ceremony.

""It was a lovely moment,"" she said. “She'd pushed so much for that award and she pushed for the women's game and for women's goalkeepers to be seen and recognised. Everything she's done for the England game and women's football in general is something I've wanted to continue and build on. I've got big shoes and big gloves to fill. I'm trying my hardest. I don't think I'll ever get to the standard she was at, but it was a lovely thing that she was able to be there.""

Compare that to comments made by Earps this week and one person certainly comes out looking much better than the other. The positivity in those remarks from Hampton have likely only made fans feel more inclined to go in to bat for her on social media, too. The internet has been bursting with support for the current England No.1 these past few days, just months after she starred in the Lionesses' Euro 2025 triumph.

The timing of it all has only added to criticism of Earps. To speak of Hampton like this so soon after being ousted as the Lionesses' No.1 by her has, quite frankly, come across as bitter. It's not helped by Earps' recollection of the moment she decided to retire from international football, either. That decision was called out by many at the time as a selfish act, one which left England with only one capped goalkeeper going into the Euros. While giving out experience to other shot-stoppers is not Earps' responsibility, Wiegman clearly felt she could count on her to be there to back-up Hampton. However, after being told she would be second in the pecking order, Earps called time on her Lionesses career.

“I'd like to graciously step aside,"" she told Wiegman, according to an extract in the Guardian from 'All In'. ""I'd rather Khiara [Keating] get the experience."" Keating was uncapped and just 21 years old going into the Euros, with little opportunity to play before the tournament given how close to its kick-off Earps' decision came. The 32-year-old, meanwhile, had the experience to bolster that goalkeeping union as Wiegman wanted, but Earps clearly didn't want to assume any role other than that of No.1.

""I think we had different ideas of what being a team-mate should be,"" she said when pressed further by the Guardian about issues with Hampton. However, when recalling her decision to retire, she hardly portrays herself as the ideal.

How Earps speaks about Wiegman in this passage of her book is also incredibly sad, given it was the ex-Netherlands boss who brought her out of the international wilderness and gave her the platform to become a Lionesses icon. To the surprise of many, after starting for England in a monumental friendly against Germany at Wembley in November 2019, Earps would never be called up again by then-head coach Phil Neville, and it had been almost two years since she had been involved when Wiegman included her in her first England squad, in September 2021.

From there, the goalkeeper blossomed into an assured and often outstanding No.1, enjoying her biggest moments at Euro 2022 and the 2023 Women's World Cup. Wiegman trusted her wholeheartedly. Yet, in her book, as Earps recalls the moment she was told Hampton would be England's No.1 at the Euros, a decision Wiegman says she and her staff had ""only just made"" when they told her in April of this year, Earps writes: ""That sounded like bullsh*t to me.""

It's no wonder Bompastor, when offering words of support for Hampton this past weekend, also felt compelled to stand up for Wiegman, too: “I just feel like with what I read in terms of comments coming from Mary Earps, it is not acceptable not to show respect to your team-mate or your manager. We are talking about Hannah but I am also raising my voice for Sarina. I just think when you use some words saying something about someone who won the European Championship three times in a row, you should probably think about it before you speak.""

Did Earps not think this would be the reaction as she released high-profile criticism of a player and a coach who are both incredibly popular across the nation? Her social media posts suggest not, but it's hard to see how she thought these comments, and this timing, was ever a good idea or how it would ever show her in a good light.

It's a shame, too, because, as Earps notes, there are a lot of things that she has discussed in her book that are powerful and eye-opening. She discusses her battle to get replica goalkeeper shirts on sale, sexuality, depression, a drinking problem, eating issues and much more. In moments she does, too, give out praise, though not to a degree that will satisfy everyone.

Yet, when combined with the shock and intrigue her retirement caused, it is an extract focusing on what is hardly a warm relationship with Hampton, her selfish reaction to the loss of the England No.1 shirt and her criticism of Wiegman's handling of the matter that was always going to overshadow everything else.

When GOAL spoke to Earps last month, she talked about her upcoming return to Manchester United, which she will make with Paris Saint-Germain when the two face off in the Champions League at Old Trafford on November 12. ""I never really got an opportunity to say goodbye, so I'm looking forward to it,"" she said, having departed the club after the season had ended and her contract had expired.

It's not the only return to England that was expected to come in the near future as, upon the announcement of her international retirement, the Football Association (FA) had committed to giving Earps ""a full tribute"" at one of the Lionesses' fixtures after the Euros. November 29, before England's friendly with China at Wembley, was a date proposed to the goalkeeper, but she was unable to accept the invitation, with discussions ongoing about a more suitable date.

It was anticipated that, for both games, Earps would be greeted with an incredible reception. As well as enjoying an iconic stint as England's No.1, she played a key role at United for five years, culminating in winning the Red Devils' first-ever major trophy on the women's side, in the FA Cup final. She departed as a very popular player and person.

What about now? Social media is full-to-bursting with disappointed and angry fans who feel Earps' words are unnecessary and poorly timed, and that she has tarnished a legacy that, until this point, was certainly one to be celebrated. When the former England goalkeeper steps foot back on home soil, in a stadium full of supporters with varying intensities of fandom, perhaps it will become more obviously apparent just how much damage she has done. For now, it's clear that she is never going to be revered in the same way again, not like she was just six months ago.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","The Ox is back! Why free agent Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has returned to Arsenal","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/ox-back-why-free-agent-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-returned-arsenal-explained/blt71b71de3c3ea9a4c","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 14:42:46 GMT","

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has returned to Arsenal after eight years and has been spotted training with the club's Under-21 side. Oxlade-Chamberlain left the Gunners in 2017 to join Premier League rivals Liverpool, where he spent six years before heading to Besiktas in Turkey. This summer, the versatile midfielder mutually terminated his contract to become a free agent.

After graduating from Southampton's youth academy, Oxlade-Chamberlain represented the Saints' senior side for a season before catching the eye of legendary former Gunners boss Arsene Wenger, who signed the wide player in 2011. At Arsenal, the now-32-year-old won three FA Cup titles and as many Community Shields during his six-year-long stint at Emirates Stadium. 

The journey came to an end when he was picked up by Jurgen Klopp ahead of the 2017-18 season as the Reds were rebuilding their squad. Oxlade-Chamberlain was among a host of stars, including Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson, who joined the Merseyside club in that campaign. 

Sky Sports report that Oxlade-Chamberlain has returned to Arsenal after a gap of eight years, as he was spotted in a training session with the Gunners' U21 side on Monday. Oxlade-Chamberlain is currently a free agent after his Besiktas contract was mutually terminated in the summer. Ahead of finding a new home, the experienced operator returned to his former club to continue training and keep himself fit and ready for a fresh challenge.

The England international won five trophies during his time at Anfield, including the Champions League in 2019 and the Premier League in 2020, with his most productive season being the 2019-20 campaign, where he made 43 appearances and scored eight goals.

In an interview with The Athletic this summer, Oxlade-Chamberlain revealed why he parted ways with the Reds two years ago. He said: ""It was never said. I obviously got the picture. I got told before they released the statement: 'Just so you know, we're putting this out about you, Milly, Bobby and Naby leaving'. And I was like, 'Oh, OK. Thanks'. But there was nothing official at any point before. It was just... the silence was enough to know what the situation was. I want to be the best person to everyone around me and a good person to have around the lads, the staff, stuff like that.

""You just expect certain things to be told - whether it's good, bad, whatever, that's how the game goes. The lack of communication was a bit surprising. [He and Klopp] had a good relationship. There was never any falling-out or anything like that. I understand as a manager it's not easy to navigate every player's needs, but when I was playing, I definitely enjoyed him a lot more than when I wasn't even on the bench! But that's how it goes.""

Oxlade-Chamberlain departed Besiktas this summer after just two years in Turkey. The Englishman played under former Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but struggled to make too much of a lasting impact at the club due to constant injury problems.

The 32-year-old midfielder, who is currently without a club, had emerged as a target for a number of English clubs in the summer, including Tom Brady-backed Birmingham City and newly-promoted Premier League club Leeds United, but none of the moves materialised. 

Sky Sports pundits further claimed that the ex-Gunners star could link up with his former colleague Jack Wilshere at Luton Town. Wilshere is in charge of the Hatters, who are currently placed 10th in the League One table with 19 points from 13 matches. The experienced Englishman could be a key addition to Wilshere's squad on a free transfer, as the club aim to finish as high as possible in the third tier this year.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The FIFPRO Men's World 11 was revealed Monday, with Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele highlighting the side, but there no place for Inter Miami's Lionel Messi for just the second time in nearly 20 years. Five players from PSG's Champions League winning team, including goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, were named to the squad, which is voted for by players. 

The 2025 squad is composed of some of the brightest talents in Europe, and features representatives from four of Europe's big five leagues:

The Parisians, unsurprisingly, lead the way, with five of the club's starting XI of the Champions League winning side honored. They might have had more, too. Centerback Marquinhos and midfielder Joao Neves were both nominated - but neither cracked the side.

Winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia was a surprise omission from the list of nominees, which was released in October. Barcelona and Real Madrid were next on the list, with two players apiece, voted in by their peers.

Meanwhile, Lamine Yamal became the youngest-ever player named in the Men's World 11, and Chelsea's Cole Palmer is one of six debutants.

""Being part of the FIFPRO World 11 is obviously a great honor and to be voted by the other players is a nice feeling,"" said Palmer. ""They know what it takes, obviously, to play the game at a high level, so to be voted by them is the best feeling.""

The headline omission was Messi. The Argentine missed the 2024 squad, as well, after making it for 17 straight years. He figured to have an outside shot after being nominated and shortlisted this year, but was unable to crack the team.

Other absentees were perhaps more surprising. Mohamed Salah wasn't included in the World 11, despite leading the Premier League in both goals and assists - and also leading Liverpool to the title.

Cristiano Ronaldo received a nomination, but was not in the team. Alisson Becker, Trent Alexander Arnold and Raphinha - despite being considered a Ballon d'Or candidate for much of the season - also missed out. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Find out who won the very first World Cup in 1930 and how the tournament began.

It all started as an invitational tournament when Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) capitalised on Uruguay's centenary year since independence and selected the nation to host the first-ever FIFA World Cup from July 13 to 30, 1930.

At the time, La Celeste were in the spotlight as a global football powerhouse given their Olympic football gold medals in 1924 and 1928.

The tournament featured 13 teams, including seven from South America, four from Europe, and two from North America. Interestingly, many European nations were hesitant to participate due to the significant cost and duration of sea travel, but France, Belgium, Romania, and Yugoslavia ultimately made the journey.

The first FIFA World Cup was won by Uruguay in 1930. This historic tournament, organised by FIFA, marked the beginning of the world's most prestigious football competition. It not only exhibited international football talent but also set the precedent for what would become a global sporting spectacle. Their conquest on home soil marked a symbol of national pride and set their status as one of football's early giants. July 31 was declared a national holiday in the country to honour a historic victory.

The final was held on July 30, 1930, at the 93,000-capacity Estadio Centenario in Montevideo, Uruguay.

In the rip-roaring contest between two intense South American rivals, Pablo Dorado put Uruguay ahead early, but Carlos Peucelle quickly equalised for Argentina. Guillermo Stabile then gave Argentina a 2-1 lead heading into halftime. However, Uruguay staged a comeback in the second half. Pedro Cea levelled the score, and Santos Iriarte put them in the lead. Along with the team's strong defensive performance, Hector Castro sealed a 4-2 victory with only a minute left, securing the trophy for Uruguay.

Interestingly, it was a rematch of the 1928 Olympic gold medal game after a 2-1 win in a replay, and Uruguay went on to win their second World Cup in 1950.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

A furious Eddie Howe slammed the mentality of his Newcastle United players after a damning defeat to West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday. The Magpies had a nightmare outing at the London Stadium as they gifted the Hammers their first home win in nine months. After the loss, Howe's side have now slipped to 13th place in the Premier League table, with just three wins from their first 10 matches.

The Magpies started the game on a bright note as Jacob Murphy put the visitors in front after just four minutes. The right-winger weaved in and out of the Hammers defence before striking hard into the bottom-left corner. But Newcastle could only hold onto their lead for half an hour as Lucas Paqueta, looking to lead West Ham to safety, curled an effort from distance past the diving Nick Pope. Ten minutes later, an Aaron Wan-Bissaka cutback was turned into his own net by Sven Botman to give the hosts the lead. Newcastle pushed, but were unable to find a way back into the game and Tomas Soucek bundled home in injury time to seal the three points.

It was the Magpies' fourth defeat of the season, as it left them struggling in 13th in the league table with just three wins from their first 10 league games. Star forward Anthony Gordon drew a lot of criticism as his Premier League goal drought extended to 19 matches.

Speaking to reporters about his team's performance after the game, a frustrated Howe said: ""The dynamism wasn't there. The physicality and the energy were missing. We scored early and could have grabbed hold of the game but we didn't and let it slip away. It didn't look like a Newcastle team that we've seen in recent seasons. The body language, the collective spirit on the pitch, loads of little things weren't there. It was a by-product of us just not being where we needed to be mentally.""

On subbing off stars like Gordon and Nick Woltemade, the English coach added: ""I could have taken anyone off. That is a reflection of where we were at that stage of the game. It is very rare for me to feel that way. I don't think I have since I have been Newcastle manager.""

Hammers boss Nuno Espirito Santo was happy to gift the West Ham fans the victory over the Magpies, as the Portuguese coach said: ""I think the fans saw something in the team today. This is what we want. How can we as a team show to our fans that we want to fight and we want to change the situation.""

He added: ""The players are realising that winning in the Premier League, we have to work very hard. We will do it again. The win makes it easier, there are smiles and the legs feel easier. We see slight improvements on the pitch. We have to create a platform on the pitch.""

Captain Jarrod Bowen told Sky Sports: ""It's obviously been a difficult period. But when I've spoke to the lads, [I've said] we're the only ones who change it. When mine [my shot] hit the post... sometimes you think ‘Is our luck going to change?' But we stuck at it and we went on to get a comfortable win. Yes, it's been frustrating. But we have so much potential in this squad, and I've told the team, it's up to us to go out and show it.""

Newcastle's players will now shift focus to Europe and aim to get back to winning ways after the disappointing away defeat against West Ham. In the Champions League, Howe's men have registered back-to-back wins after going down against Barcelona in their opening game. They next host Athletic Club at St James' Park on Wednesday before facing Brentford in a Premier League clash on November 9, their final game before the international break.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Alexander Blockx and Rafael Jodar have climbed in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah after they won ATP Challenger Tour titles in Bratislava and Charlottesville, respectively.

Blockx overcame former World No. 21 Jan-Lennard Struff in his opener and then defeated Titouan Droguet in the final to clinch his second Challenger Tour crown of the season. The 20-year-old Belgian is up to fourth in the Live Race To Jeddah and is set to make his debut at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in December. Earlier this year he won a main draw match at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Cincinnati.

Spaniard Jodar has jumped to ninth after success in Charlottesville. The 19-year-old, who was a sparring partner at the 20-and-under event in 2024, has now won two Challengers in the past three weeks.

Last month, Jodar caught up with ATPTour.com to discuss how he is balancing his tennis with his studies.

“I tried to complete all the assignments and all the tasks on Friday and Saturday, so I could enjoy the day off Sunday,” Jodar told ATPTour.com in October. “I have my laptop with me. You always have to do some work. It's good to keep your mind not thinking about tennis all day. When I have some free time, I do some work to catch up on the material that they do during the weeks I'm missing.”

A son of two teachers, Jodar takes pride in managing academics even amid his rise in pro tennis.

“They've always given priority to studies,” Jodar said of his parents. “And I'm on the same page. I think studies are very important for your development as a person.”

The Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF will take place in Jeddah from 17-21 December. The cutoff date for the Live Race is 10th November, with the Top eight players qualifying for the 20-and-under event. Joao Fonseca won the title in 2024, joining a list of former champions that includes Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.

With just six days to go until the Nitto ATP Finals, there is only one more qualification spot up for grabs. ATPTour.com looks at the movers of the week as of Monday 3 November, following the Rolex Paris Masters.



Felix Auger-Aliassime – eighth (3,845 points)
The Canadian has surged into the final qualification spot in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin after he reached the final in Paris. The 25-year-old earned three comeback victories in the French capital and defeated Valentin Vacherot and Alexander Bublik to advance to his second ATP Masters 1000 final. He lost to Jannik Sinner in the title match.






Lorenzo Musetti – ninth (3,685)
Musetti must win the title at the ATP 250 event in Athens if he is to qualify for the year-end event for the first time. Should 23-year-old Musetti join new World No. 1 Sinner in Turin, it will be the first time that two Italians have qualified for the season finale, which this year offers more than $5 million to an undefeated champion. Musetti will face Stan Wawrinka or Botic van de Zandschulp in his opener.
Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, Novak Djokovic, Alexander Zverev, Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton and Alex de Minaur have qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals, taking place from 9-16 November at Inalpi Arena in Turin.

 Italian Lorenzo Musetti controls his own Nitto ATP Finals qualification destiny this week in Athens as the 2025 ATP Tour season enters the final week of the regular season. 

 Musetti, who begins the week ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin, must win the title at the new ATP 250 to clinch the final berth at the elite eight-man (and eight doubles team) season finale in Turin from 9-16 November. 

 Musetti slipped outside the cut last week in Paris when Felix Auger-Aliassime moved to eighth by reaching the final. The Canadian would have clinched the final Turin spot on Sunday had he upset Jannik Sinner in the final of the Rolex Paris Masters. 

 Should 23-year-old Musetti join new World No. 1 Sinner in Turin, it will be the first time that two Italians have qualified for the season finale, which this year offers more than $5 million to an undefeated champion. 



 Musetti, who fell to countryman Lorenzo Sonego in his Paris opener, has a bye in the first round of the Vanda Pharmaceuticals Hellenic Championship in Athens. He will play the winner of veteran Swiss wild card Stan Wawrinka and Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp in the second round. 

 Auger-Aliassime has withdrawn from this week's other ATP 250 in Metz.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Only three women have repeated as the WTA Finals winner over the past quarter century. Coco Gauff, the defending champion here, is already discovering why.

“I think, A, it's one of those tournaments you're not guaranteed a spot in every year,” Gauff explained before this year-end tournament began. “Some people win and aren't able to even qualify. B, the top eight in the world, it's very hard to I think win this tournament in general, let alone replicate it back-to-back years.

“But I'm not thinking about that. I really just want to focus on my first match ahead. I think that's what I did last year.”

A year ago, Gauff was a revelation, winning her last four matches -- two of them over No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and No. 2 Iga Swiatek -- to win the crown with a memorable third-set tiebreak over Zheng Qinwen.

This year? Her opening match on Sunday against fellow American and good friend Jessica Pegula did not go nearly as well. There were a raft of double faults and missed forehands and a frustration level that was increasingly evident. At one point, Pegula hit an awkward shot that, although it bounced within range, Gauff didn't even get off a proper swing at the ball.

The No. 3 seed faces possible elimination in a Tuesday match against No. 7 Jasmine Paolini.

“Yeah, every match here is tough,” Gauff said. “I played her in Wuhan, so I expect her to play differently than she did in that match. It's another opportunity to be better and hopefully I can win that one to give myself a chance to qualify for the semis.”

`Really, really hard'

Eighteen-time Grand Slam singles champion Chris Evert lived for the summer, focusing primarily on the three majors -- Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the US Open.

“Most of the players peak during the summer,” Evert said. “After the [US] Open, I was done. It was a struggle for me to play Stuttgart and the other fall tournaments, even the year-end championship. It's really, really hard.

“It's at the end of the year. It's the last tournament and everybody's starting to feel a little fatigue, mentally and physically.”

And yet, Evert managed to win four WTA Finals singles titles, fourth on the all-time list, behind rival Martina Navratilova (8), Stefani Graf and Serena Williams (5 each).

Simona Halep qualified for the WTA Finals five times, reaching the final in her very first, in 2014, before losing to Williams 6-3, 6-0 in Singapore. It was Serena's third consecutive title, marking the last time there was a repeat champion. 

“It's an honor to qualify, and you look forward to it,” Halep said. “But when you finally get there your level of energy is a little bit low. And then there is another reason, the biggest one:

“It's also the players. You play a final of a mandatory tournament or a Grand Slam every match. This is also a big pressure.”

Sabalenka has collected four Grand Slam titles, but this big bucket-list item has so far eluded her. The closest Sabalenka's come was three years ago in Fort Worth when she lost a tight match in the final to Caroline Garcia. The past two years, she's fallen in the semifinals -- to eventual champions Iga Swiatek and Gauff.

“It might just be [the season's] timing,” said Jason Stacy, Sabalenka's fitness coach.





 Jimmie48/WTA
                        

It's also about peaking at just the right time. No one, even Sabalenka, can be consistently dialed in over 10-plus months.

Her tactical coach, Anton Dubrov, cited a different kind of timing.

“It's the eight best players who perform the best during the year,” Dubrov said. “For example, one player might have their best matches at the beginning of the year. Maybe it's helpful for them because they're more fresh. 

“But then you have [Jasmine] Paolini and [Elena] Rybakina, who played the last couple of tournaments. It might be helpful because they're on a roll right now.”

Not a moment to relax

As the depth in women's tennis has improved, it's been increasingly difficult to repeat.

Navratilova won five straight singles titles in the mid-1980s and 10 of 11 doubles titles from 1980-89. Monica Seles was the singles champion from 1990-92 and Graf won three of four from 1993-96.

It's difficult in any sport to finish the season with a brilliant burst two years in a row. It's worth noting that the Los Angeles Dodgers just became the first Major League Baseball team to repeat since the New York Yankees, a quarter century ago.

Since 2015, no singles champion has managed to repeat. Three of them -- Dominika Cibulkova, Garbine Muguruza and Caroline Garcia -- failed to even qualify the following year. There were also extenuating circumstances: Williams was the World No. 1 in 2015 but shut it down after the US Open with an injury. In 2020, the year COVID-19 suffocated the schedule, the WTA Finals were canceled, meaning that there was no defending champion in 2021.





 Sport/Getty Images
                        

Elina Svitolina, the 2018 champion, came the closest, reaching the 2019 final as the No. 8 seed before falling to Ashleigh Barty 6-4, 6-3 in the final.

Since the turn of the century, it's been only Kim Clijsters in 2003, Justine Henin in 2007 and Serena in 2013 and 2014.

“Only three players?” tournament director Muguruza asked, sounding slightly surprised. “That's a really low number. First you need to already qualify, then survive the round-robin format, not getting injured in these intense matches.

“There is not one day that you can even relax a little bit. If it's not the day of the match, the day in between you already need to prepare and know that now I'm playing against this other player, all the achievements they've done. 

“It's really mentally tough knowing that every single match you have to be on your 100 percent, or at least 80 percent.”

Evert agrees that, in the end, all the year-end champions share that single trait.

“There's so many ups and downs,” Evert said. “You can have a strong first half of the year and then it's hard to keep it up. Kudos to the depth of the women's game and how close everybody is.

“Skill-set-wise and talent-wise, it very often comes down to the mental part. Who's the most mentally focused?”","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

From Lando Norris' disco ball to Alex Albon's Miami orange, special edition helmets have been everywhere this season. We take a look back at where it all began.

Special edition helmets are a relatively recent addition to Formula 1's long history – what was once purely a piece of safety equipment has become a canvas for drivers and sponsors to showcase their personality, pay tribute or have some fun.

The journey from mostly plain lids to glittering, custom-designed works of art has been full of experimentation over the years – including design restrictions and concerns about the weight of paint. Here's a look back at how special edition helmets became a beloved part of F1's identity.

In a sport where faces are hidden behind visors, a helmet has always been a driver's signature. For decades, drivers such as James Hunt, John Surtees, and Sir Jackie Stewart kept the same design throughout their entire careers.

Back then, helmets weren't nearly as protective, and their main purpose besides safety was for the fans and marshals to tell the drivers apart. Even so, individuality did shine through at time. Hunt's name stretched boldly along the side of his helmet, while Stewart paid homage to his Scottish roots with a tartan band around the crown.

Few designs, however, are as instantly recognisable as Ayrton Senna's yellow, green and blue helmet – an enduring Brazilian icon that once fetched nearly $1million at auction.

For much of F1's history, a helmet represented the driver but not the team. That began to change when Michael Schumacher moved to Ferrari and decided to replace the German flag on his helmet with a bright red design to match his new team's colours. This marked the start of a new, more flexible era, one where creativity and collaboration between driver and team became the norm.

Helmet designs don't come out of thin air, and every special edition helmet begins with an artist – both a designer and engineer. Two of the best-known names in this profession are Jens Munser and Mad 56.

Munser, the mastermind behind Schumacher's Ferrari-era lids, Lando Norris's squiggles, and Sebastian Vettel's 2024 Imola Senna tribute explained to Motorsport Tech Magazine: “The process hasn't changed much – we still start with sketches – but we now use printed stickers for logos instead of hand-painting every detail. We've improved the pigments to make paint lighter and more resistant to stones. Michael always wanted to save weight, even if it meant a less glossy finish.”

Mad 56, real name Massimo Dante, works primarily with Red Bull and has also collaborated with Williams driver Alex Albon for more than a decade. Though artists have creative freedom, they must balance aesthetics with FIA regulations and sponsor requirements, which is a tricky art in itself.

In 2015, the FIA announced that drivers must stick to a single helmet design during the entire season, as some of the constantly changing special edition helmets were starting to cause issues. The reasoning was simple: fans, commentators, and race officials were struggling to recognise who was behind the wheel!

The move came after a series of increasingly elaborate designs – most famously Sebastian Vettel's 2012 LED-lit helmet in Singapore. The glowing design, while undoubtedly eye-catching, raised safety concerns and was quickly banned, prompting the FIA to rethink just how far helmet customisation should go.

The single-design regulation remained in place until 2020, but even under those tighter rules, creativity didn't disappear. Designers found clever ways to work within the limits – for example, Lewis Hamilton's special edition Mexico City Grand Prix helmets, or Sebastian Vettel subtly changing the colour of his usual helmet at the Monaco Grand Prix in 2017.

When the ban was lifted at the beginning of 2020, a wave of colour and creativity returned to the grid – and it hasn't slowed down since.

Today, F1's grid is awash with one-off designs, each a reflection of personality, heritage, and at times – humour. Amongst his many iconic special edition helmets, Lewis Hamilton collaborated with Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama for a chrome-inspired Japanese Grand Prix special in 2023, Valtteri Bottas once ran a pre-season helmet modelled on his own head, and Albon's designs often pay tribute to his pets and his home nation of Thailand.

The 2025 season has also seen plenty of eye-catching limited-edition designs – from bold artistic statements to heartfelt tributes. One standout came from the youngest designer yet, Thea, the young fan behind Carlos Sainz's unofficial mascot “Sparkles” the unicorn. The Spaniard wore Thea's design as a sticker on his helmet for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and, while it was meant as a one-off, after his P3 finish in Baku, there's no wonder he'd want his new mascot to stick around!

While some special edition helmet designs are lighthearted, others carry deep personal significance. One of the best examples of this was Romain Grosjean during his return to the Haas garage for Pirelli tyre testing, where he was finally able to wear the helmet that his children had designed for his planned 2020 farewell race – one he never got to use after his terrifying Bahrain crash.

It was a very sentimental helmet and reaffirmed that special edition helmets can be much more than just a marketing tool when they hold such meaning for the drivers.

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

With the Drivers' Championship continuing to hot up, as well as various battles in the Teams' Championship, here are the big stories ahead of the 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

Following a change in championship leader with just four rounds still to run, there are now just 36 points separating the three title contenders. Heading into the final standalone race of the season, the pressure is only growing on multiple fronts, with an often-dramatic trip to Interlagos on the horizon.

Lando Norris held the championship lead for the first four rounds of this season, but in Saudi Arabia he was usurped by team mate Oscar Piastri. The Australian led the way heading into the following 15 rounds, but Norris' victory in Mexico saw him regain top spot by a solitary point.

The gap between the two McLaren drivers had grown to as much as 34 points after Norris' retirement from the Dutch Grand Prix, but he has outscored Piastri at every race since that point to put himself in prime position with four rounds to go.

Not only is it important to remember just how slender the advantage is, but it is also significant in the way it marks a different dynamic between the McLaren pair. No longer is Norris the one doing the chasing – having said after Zandvoort that “it's almost a big enough gap now that I can just chill out about it and just go for it” – but instead he has moved into the role of being chased by everyone.

For Piastri, the past two race weekends have been particularly tough, as he has struggled to match Norris' pace and has had to adapt his driving style, but the initial feedback from McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella was that progress had been made in Mexico City. How Piastri builds on that, and how Norris handles the focus of being the championship leader, will be fascinating.

As tough as the Mexico City Grand Prix was for Red Bull and Max Verstappen, the defending champion actually managed to close the gap to the championship lead.

Verstappen arrived in Mexico off the back of three wins and two second places in the past five rounds, and had rapidly reduced Piastri's advantage to just 40 points. As the weekend unfolded at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, it became clear Verstappen did not have the pace to challenge for victory, but he was able to salvage a podium that further outscored Piastri, and leaves him 36 points adrift of Norris.

A year ago, the roles were somewhat reversed, as Norris was the one hunting down Verstappen, sitting 47 points back of the championship leader arriving at Interlagos.

After cutting that gap to 44 points after the Sprint, Norris started on pole with Verstappen in 17th due to a grid penalty, but a remarkable performance in the wet saw the Dutchman climb through the field to win. With Norris finishing sixth, the gap was extended to 62 points with three rounds remaining, and Verstappen was able to clinch the championship at the next round.

Although the gaps are smaller this year, it shows how one result can totally change the complexion of the championship picture at this stage of the season, and Verstappen will be keen to ensure he at least stays in the frame heading to Las Vegas to kick-off the final triple header.

Although a lot of the focus is on what is happening at the top of the Drivers' Championship, there are some thrilling battles ongoing when it comes to the Teams' standings.

Second place is currently occupied by Ferrari, but like Norris in the Drivers' standings, they are just one point ahead of the next team, with Mercedes sitting in third place. Red Bull are also right in the mix, with double points in three of the last six races allowing them to stay just 10 points back of Ferrari.

The fluctuating form between the front-running teams makes it tough to predict who will come out on top, although Red Bull will likely need some more wins from Verstappen to have a chance of moving further up the order.

While Williams appear relatively secure in fifth place overall, behind them there is another tense fight for sixth. Racing Bulls currently occupy sixth position on 72 points, but Aston Martin (69), Haas (62) and Sauber (60) are all very much in contention, following a big result for Haas in Mexico.

A year ago, Alpine secured a shock double podium to move from eighth to sixth in one go, so there's history of Interlagos offering up opportunities for significant scores.

The 2025 silly season has been far less dramatic than a year ago, but as we enter November there are still quite a few unknowns when it comes to who will be driving where next season.

The majority of those questions relate to the Red Bull driver line-up, across both Red Bull Racing and Racing Bulls.

Verstappen is secure at Red Bull, but the identity of his team mate remains unknown. Yuki Tsunoda currently holds the seat, but Isack Hadjar has been linked with a promotion, and with Arvid Lindblad pushing for a Racing Bulls chance, it could become a straight fight between Tsunoda and Liam Lawson for the remaining position.

Alpine have also yet to finalise their line-up for next year, with Franco Colapinto trying to retain his seat alongside Pierre Gasly. Colapinto will receive significant support from fans in South America during the Sao Paulo Grand Prix weekend, and it could mark a good time to confirm his future if he is to stay put.

Aside from the final results, if there is one thing that stands out when thinking back to last year's race, it is the weather.

The Sprint means there are an extra eight points on offer on the Saturday, and a year ago that race was followed by heavy rain and thunderstorms that pushed Qualifying back to early on Sunday morning. The race itself was also wet, providing the ingredients for a classic drive from Verstappen as he went from 17th on the grid to victory.

The long-term forecast suggests there could be rain and thunderstorms again during the race weekend, and that always opens up the opportunity for some unexpected results. But whatever the weather, the iconic Interlagos circuit and the passionate Brazilian fans often combine for a special race that could prove pivotal when it comes to the championship.

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

F1.com takes a look back at some of the most iconic images in the sport's history, ranging from the early days of the championship through to the modern era.

Over the course of its 75 championship years so far, Formula 1 has witnessed countless iconic moments both on and off the track. From thrilling battles to fierce rivalries, emotional outbursts to dramatic crashes, the sport has continued to deliver unforgettable scenes.

Many of these have been captured on camera, with these photos going on to become legendary in their own right.

As F1 enters into the latter stages of its 75th year, we've been taking a look back at some of these particularly special images from the archive, ranging from the early days right through to the modern era…

On May 13, 1950, Silverstone hosted the first race of the inaugural Formula 1 World Championship. Over 70 laps, 24 drivers went racing in front of a crowd estimated to number up to 120,000 spectators, while prestigious guests included His Royal Highness King George VI, Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.

Giuseppe ‘Nino' Farina took victory; while the Italian's fellow Alfa Romeo driver Juan Manuel Fangio had led, a broken oil pipe forced the future five-time World Champion to retire. It was the first of three wins for Farina that season, who went on to become the sport's maiden championship victor.

Graham Hill was leading the 1968 championship standings ahead of Round 6 of the campaign at France's Rouen-Les-Essarts Circuit. In a race marred by the tragic death of Jo Schlesser following a crash on Lap 2, Hill retired his Lotus on Lap 14 owing to an issue with his car.

Despite his retirement, the Briton seemed keen to help team mate Jo Siffert, who was still running amid damp conditions. Siffert stopped by the side of the track as Hill gave him his rain visor to help with driving against the spray, a moment that has since become a famed image depicting this particular era in the sport.

The story of James Hunt and Niki Lauda's battle for the title in 1976 is well known, with the ups and downs of that season – which featured Lauda's remarkable comeback from a horrifying crash at the Nurburgring – leading to the tale being retold in the 2013 film Rush.

But despite their on-track rivalry, the two drivers also shared a friendship away from racing. Lauda went on to describe Hunt as an “open, honest to God pal” – something that this photo, captured at the Belgian Grand Prix in 1977, seems to capture.

The 1980s saw the emergence of some big icons of the sport – and, ahead of the 1986 Portuguese Grand Prix, four of these star names posed for a famous photograph, with all still in contention for the title prior to the race.

Lotus' Ayrton Senna, McLaren's Alain Prost and the Williams pair of Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet all smiled for the cameras amid a close championship fight amongst them. It was ultimately Prost who took the crown on this occasion – and these four drivers would be responsible for every title victory that followed until 1994.

After that aforementioned 1986 triumph, Prost had to wait until 1989 for his third World Championship – which arrived in dramatic style following a controversial collision with Senna, now his McLaren team mate, at Suzuka.

Contact at the Casio Triangle chicane put Prost out of the race, with the Frenchman subsequently captured by photographers as he walked away from his MP4/5. While Senna had continued on, the Brazilian was later disqualified for cutting the chicane when he rejoined, meaning that the title went to Prost.

Another memorable picture from that era came at Silverstone in 1991. Senna had arrived into the weekend as championship leader, having bolstered his points with a run of four consecutive victories when the season got underway.

It was Mansell's time to shine at the British Grand Prix, however, with the home favourite taking the win. Senna ran out of fuel on the last lap, but was still classified in fourth – and famously hitched a ride on Mansell's triumphant Williams after the chequered flag.

Later on in the 1990s, an iconic rivalry developed between McLaren's Mika Hakkinen and Ferrari's Michael Schumacher, one that was respectful but also featured some incredible battles on the track.

Perhaps one of the most famous moments between the two occurred at the 2000 Belgian Grand Prix, where Hakkinen overtook Schumacher for the lead as both lapped backmarker Ricardo Zonta. As this post-race photograph shows, the duo were seen deep in conversation after Hakkinen went on to take the win.

When the 2009 campaign began, Jenson Button and the Brawn GP team caused a shock by embarking on a stunning run of victories, winning six of the seven opening races.

While Button did not triumph again that season as the squad's rivals caught up, that early success was enough to secure him a maiden title at the penultimate race in Brazil, sparking memorable scenes as the wide-eyed new World Champion celebrated his achievement.

After Button's championship success, Sebastian Vettel was the next man to experience title glory for the first time in 2010, a feat he repeated three more times as he wrapped up an impressive four consecutive titles.

The final one of these arrived during a dominant 2013 season for Vettel, the German sealing his fourth crown with three races to spare at the Indian Grand Prix. Following his latest win, the four-time World Champion bowed down on his knees in front of his Red Bull RB9 machine.

While both titles had been decided prior to the 2018 season finale in Abu Dhabi – having been won by Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes – the campaign came to a close in unforgettable style thanks to a special moment after the chequered flag.

With the event marking Fernando Alonso's final race at the time – before his later comeback in 2021 – the Spaniard lined up alongside fellow World Champions Hamilton and Vettel to perform some celebratory donuts on the grid.

Amid a shortened season owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes had continued their run of success, the Briton having already notched up nine victories before Round 14 in Turkey.

Another win that weekend brought Hamilton a historic seventh World Championship, equalling Michael Schumacher's tally. It was clearly an emotional moment for the driver, who knelt forwards on the halo of his W11 in parc ferme as he processed what he had done.

One of the sport's most shocking incidents of recent times took place in Bahrain during the latter stages of the 2020 season, when Haas' Romain Grosjean suffered a crash through the barriers on the opening lap of the race that saw his car burst into flames.

The Frenchman managed to extricate himself from the wreckage and, with help from the attending medical team, made his way to the ambulance where he was subsequently transferred to hospital. He was treated for burns to his hands and his ankle, while the race would prove to be Grosjean's last in Formula 1.

In 2021, a fierce battle for the Drivers' Championship played out between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen that went right down to the wire, with several contentious moments along the way.

So tight was the duel that every point counted more than ever – and the intensity shone through when a late-race tyre failure for Verstappen put him out of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, the Dutchman famously kicking the left rear that had suffered the blowout in frustration as he walked away from his stricken car.

Charles Leclerc had seemingly carried something of a home race curse across much of his F1 career when it came to the Monaco Grand Prix, the Ferrari driver having generally suffered bad luck at the event since his debut in 2018.

But all that changed at the 2024 race, in which the Monegasque converted pole position into an emotional win. The result sparked unforgettable scenes after the chequered flag had fallen as Leclerc celebrated the result with his team.

The Las Vegas Grand Prix has delivered the spectacle both on and off track since joining the calendar in 2023 – and it was an especially important race for Max Verstappen in 2024, with it being the scene of the Red Bull driver sealing his fourth consecutive World Championship.

While he had been in dominant form during his previous title win, this one proved more hard-fought for the Dutchman, and the joy at securing the crown was clear to see as he held four fingers aloft for the cameras.

News of Lewis Hamilton's switch to Ferrari for the 2025 season sent shockwaves through the F1 world when it was announced before the 2024 campaign had even begun, with the move bringing an end to the Briton's long and successful partnership with Mercedes.

Needless to say, there was much anticipation ahead of the seven-time World Champion's first days with the Scuderia – and the photos showing him on his maiden visit to Maranello as a Ferrari driver quickly gained iconic status.

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

With just four rounds left in the 2025 Formula 1 season, Lawrence Barretto assesses who could be strong at each of the remaining weekends as the battle for the championship nears its climax.

A couple of months ago, both the Drivers' and Teams' Championships looked like foregone conclusions. Oscar Piastri had just won the Dutch Grand Prix – and with McLaren team mate Lando Norris suffering a mechanical failure when running second, the Australian's advantage over Norris ballooned to 34 points. Max Verstappen, meanwhile, was a monstrous 104 adrift in P3...

But while McLaren converted that advantage by wrapping up the defence of the Team's Championship three races later in Singapore, a plot twist had been written in courtesy of Red Bull and Verstappen. With their rivals fully focused on development for the new-for-2026 regulations, Red Bull opted to divert a bit more cash to this year's car – and it was paying off.

Verstappen won three races in four weekends and was forcing his way into title contention while Piastri was going the other way. Having been on the podium in 14 of the first 16 races of 2025, Piastri is now on a run of four races outside the top three and has lost his grip on the title lead for the first time since Saudi Arabia.

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

Charles Leclerc has been celebrating some happy news away from the track, with the Ferrari driver announcing his engagement to partner Alexandra Saint Mleux.

Charles Leclerc has announced his engagement to long-time partner Alexandra Saint Mleux, with the Monegasque confirming the news to his social media followers over the weekend.

Leclerc took to Instagram on Sunday night to share photos of the couple holding their much-loved pet dog, Leo, alongside the caption “Mr². & Mrs. Leclerc” plus a ring emoji and several heart emojis, while Saint Mleux modelled a new ring.

While Leclerc did not share details of the proposal, the photos also show a dog tag for Leo featuring the words “Dad wants to marry you!”, as well as pictures of the celebrations including a display of red petals designed in a heart shape surrounded by candles.

The couple, who have been together since 2023, received plenty of well-wishes from the F1 community, with Leclerc's fellow Ferrari driver Lewis Hamilton commenting on the post: “Congratulations to you both”

Former team mate Carlos Sainz simply wrote “Yesssss”, while others including Oscar Piastri and Esteban Ocon also sent messages to congratulate Leclerc and Saint Mleux.

The news comes during what has seemingly been a positive few weeks for Leclerc both on and off the track, with the 28-year-old recently claiming back-to-back podiums in Austin and Mexico.

A newly-engaged Leclerc will be hoping to extend this run of form when F1 heads to Brazil for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix on the weekend of November 7-9.

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

As Gabriel Bortoleto enters into the final races of his rookie season in F1, Kick Sauber boss Jonathan Wheatley has given his take on what has particularly impressed him about the Brazilian.

Jonathan Wheatley has admitted that Gabriel Bortoleto's level of maturity is the aspect of the rookie's debut season in F1 that he has been “most surprised by”.

Bortoleto was one of a number of new arrivals on the grid this year, having made the step up from his championship-winning F2 campaign to join Kick Sauber in the top echelon.

Since then the Brazilian has gone on to score points on five occasions – which included a career-best P6 in Hungary – while his partnership with veteran team mate Nico Hulkenberg has so far brought home a total of 60 points.

Sharing his thoughts on Bortoleto's rookie season during the Mexico City Grand Prix weekend, Wheatley – who joined Kick Sauber as the squad's new Team Principal in April – praised the 21-year-old for how he has approached his first campaign in the sport.

“I think it's the maturity that I've been the most surprised by,” said Wheatley. “When you consider his age, the way he handles things – the frustration, the natural things you'd imagine from a driver in his first season – he handles them with such maturity.

“I've talked before about his work ethic; if he can be in the simulator, he's in the simulator – if he can be on a simulator, he's on a simulator. And I think on top of that, the way he's knitting his engineering team around him – the way they're working together – is hugely encouraging as well.

“And the final piece in the puzzle for me is when he's at a tricky circuit, he builds up to it. Monaco, he built up to it – his only contact with the barrier was in the race. Same in Baku, same in Singapore.

“He just has such a mature approach, so I'm hugely encouraged by his performance so far.”

Entering into the final races of Bortoleto's maiden F1 season, much of the focus for Kick Sauber will be on the tight midfield battle in the Teams' Championship, with only 12 points covering those placed between sixth and ninth.

Pushed on whether he feels that climbing up to that P6 spot – currently occupied by Racing Bulls – is feasible, Wheatley responded: “We're taking it a race at a time. Ayao [Komatsu, Team Principal at Haas] taught us a lesson a few races ago. It's so close. The margins are so close.

“I feel like I'm always saying the same thing, but it's nip and tuck all the way down the line, and it'll come down to who makes the fewest mistakes, I think, at the end of the day.

“But honestly, I'm loving our racing at the moment. I'm loving coming into this competitive environment where the margins are so tight, and the calls are so close. I'm just enjoying the season.”

The 'Last Week Tonight' host said the post was ""tone-deaf"" amid the monthlong government shutdown.

	Amid the government shutdown, President Donald Trump posted photos of a newly remodeled bathroom.


	On Friday, Trump shared a couple dozen photos of a renovated bathroom that is connected to the Lincoln Bedroom.




	“I renovated the Lincoln Bathroom in the White House,” he wrote on Truth Social. “It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era. I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”

					John Oliver on Trump's White House Demolition: ""A Metaphor That Is, If Anything, Too on the Nose""		
			









	On Sunday's Last Week Tonight, host John Oliver echoed critics of the president, noting: “That is pretty tone-deaf. And you know what? I will say to Trump what I said while watching David Harbour's Architectural Digest video: ‘You are vastly overestimating how much I care about where you take a shit.'”

	Added Oliver: “It is odd to be posting bathroom remodel photos when so many are legitimately concerned about getting the government open again.” The government shutdown, which started Oct. 1, will break a record for the longest shutdown if it continues until Tuesday.


	The bathroom isn't the only remodel Trump has ordered in the White House. He's also overseeing a demolition project on the East Wing so that he can construct a $250 million ballroom.












Oliver previously weighed in on that project after photos surfaced of the construction: “Those images are distressing, especially when you know it's all to build a giant ballroom in a style best described as ‘Med Spa Versailles.' ” He added that “the demolition of the White House [is] a metaphor that, if anything, is too on the nose” for Trump's presidency.

A nod to Hollywood film noir classics, writer-director Romas Zabarauskas' thriller, the third movie in his queer trilogy that will get its international premiere at Tallinn, features rising star Robertas Petraitis.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Things are not always what they seem. That phrase is likely to pop into your head when watching The Activist (Aktyvistas), the new crime drama from Lithuanian film writer-director Romas Zabarauskas. The noir thriller, the third movie in his queer trilogy after The Lawyer (2020) and The Writer (2023), features rising star Robertas Petraitis, known from Lithuania's 2026 Oscar contender The Southern Chronicles.


The Activist opened theatrically in Lithuania on Sept. 19, debuting in the second spot at the country's box office. It will have its international premiere at the 29th edition of the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival (PÖFF) on Nov. 14.

	“A masked intruder murders Deividas (Elvinas Juodkazis), Lithuania's most influential human rights activist, just as the city of Kaunas prepares for its first LGBTQ+ march,” reads a plot synopsis. “Only hours earlier, Deividas had clashed with his secret lover, Andrius (Petraitis), who is too afraid to come out or publicly support the fragile community. Consumed by grief and guilt, Andrius launches his own covert investigation, soon discovering that Deividas was surrounded by two-faced enemies.”

	The cast also features Vaslov Goom as Bernardas, who wants to keep activist group Rainbow going strong; Redita Dominaityte as politician Rolanda Markeviciene; Tekle Baroti as the torn Laima; Karolis Kasperavicius and Arnoldas Augustaitis as neo-Nazis Mykolas and Rytis; and more.

	











The Hollywood Reporter can exclusively reveal three clips from The Activist that give a first sense of the movie and its characters.


	The first clip shows Juodkazis as Deividas and Dominaityte as Rolanda Markeviciene as they face a protest by neo-Nazis and others. 


	The second clip from The Activist goes inside a planning meeting of right-wing activists looking to disrupt an LGBTQ+ march. In it, viewers meet Petraitis as Andrius, who is in undercover mode; Baroti as Laima; Kasperavicius as Mykolas; and Augustaitis as Rytis.


	Things threaten to get out of hand when they start discussing the address of a queer rights group.


	Petraitis' Andrius and Goom as Bernardas star in the final exclusive clip for The Activist. The dangers of Andrius' own secret investigation loom large in their tense conversation, as do a potential scandal and the question of reputation.

	According to Western Australia Police, the incident occurred on Saturday (Nov. 1) during Metallica's first Australian show since 2013. The two men — a 20-year-old from Carey Park and a 23-year-old from Australind — were removed from the venue and will face court for the dangerous stunt.

	Police confirmed that a 20-year-old man from Carey Park and a 23-year-old man from Australind were arrested and charged with trespassing after scaling the structure.


	“It will be alleged the men climbed up the central tower inside the bowl at the Metallica concert held at Optus Stadium on Saturday,” a WA Police spokesperson said, according to news.com.au.



	The concert marked the band's first return to Australian soil in over a decade. Their last local appearance was headlining the now-defunct Soundwave Festival in 2013, where they shared the bill with blink-182, Linkin Park, Slayer and Paramore.


	Support came from Suicidal Tendencies and Evanescence, while fans lined up earlier in the week at a dedicated M72 pop-up shop in Perth, offering exclusive merch, screen-printed posters, vinyl, and tour-themed skateboards.


	Metallica has enjoyed remarkable success on the Billboard charts, with their 1991 self-titled album, known as The Black Album, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and becoming one of the longest-charting albums in the chart's history. 


	The band's Australian tour continues with upcoming shows in Adelaide (Nov. 5), Melbourne (Nov. 8), Brisbane and Sydney over the next week. After wrapping their Australia and New Zealand shows, the rockers will continue the tour with Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Their current M72 World Tour will wrap in July 2026, following dates in Europe and the U.K.


	Full tour details are available on the band's official website.

Killa Bee will tell the story of Bryony Tyrell, a mother of two with a master's degree in nursing and a degree in molecular biology who worked at the ICU by day, navigating the challenges of the NHS, and at night transformed into one of Britain's leading cage fighting prospects.


	The Southampton nurse began kickboxing at university and worked her way up to black belt before branching out into martial arts. She began competing as an amateur before moving to the professional ranks and has won multiple belts.

					By Jesse Whittock 

International TV Co-Editor


EXCLUSIVE: If you ever wanted to know what's on Bob Iger‘s podcast playlist, here's your answer.


	The Disney CEO has made an appearance on The Rest is History, which claims to be the most popular history podcast with new data putting it at around 20 million monthly downloads and more than 80,000 paying members. He revealed he's a fan of the podcast, which is part of the Goalhanger-produced The Rest is… franchise.


	Iger is appearing in a two-part video special about Walt Disney's legacy this week. Scroll to the bottom for exclusive images of Iger taking The Rest is History hosts Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook on a tour around Disneyland, as they discuss Disney's legacy as an animator and film producer and the cultural significance of the theme park.

	Besides the Disney chatter, Iger told Holland and Sandbrook about his love of their work, saying: “There's mutual respect here. I've loved the lessons that both of you have taught me, and you've done so with such a great degree of humour and entertainment. And I thank both of you for everything you've taught me and the experiences you've given me.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Iger will also offer up reflections on his own time at Disney ahead of his planned exit in 2026. Iger had, of course, famously given up the Disney hot seat and retired in December 2021, only to return eleven months later after the dismissal of his successor, Bob Chapek.


The Rest is History‘s deep dive into House of Mouse's past begins today with an episode titled ‘Walt Disney: The Great American Storyteller' followed by another on Thursday, currently untitled, which will go chart to creation and enduring popularity of Disneyland.

	











	The double video release will drop on Friday featuring the exclusive interview with Iger, which was conducted on the lot in Burbank. It will also include a mini-documentary in which Iger gives Sandbrook and Holland a private historical tour of the Walt Disney Studios and Disneyland Park, exploring the latter's 1955 origins, its associated cultural milestones and the story behind its legacy.


	The trip down memory lane will have been a welcome one for Iger. Disney is currently locked in a carriage dispute with YouTube TV and dealing with the fallout of its move to exit its big-budget co-production agreement with the BBC for Doctor Who.


	Iger, whose influence on modern-day Disney cannot be understated thanks to him leading on acquisitions such as the deal for Marvel in 2009, is set to step down for a second time next year, with the likes of Disney Entertainment co-chair Dana Walden and Disney Experiences boss Josh D'Amaro among the names in the running to replace him. Whoever lands the role is stepping into arguably the highest-profile job in global entertainment.


	As for The Rest is History, the news comes after Deadline revealed in January that it is being developed as TV show. Wheelhouse is attached to develop unscripted titles based on the podcast and its library of hundreds of episodes. The podcast, from Gary Lineker's production house Goalhanger, has a huge fanbase in the U.S., and has covered American topics such as Hollywood myths about the Titanic and examining the lives and deaths of legendary figures including John F. Kennedy. Disney will be the latest in the pantheon.


	“Everybody knows the name Disney,” said Sandbrook. “It's an organisation with an almost unparalleled grip on the world's imagination – particularly of children, when your imagination is most formative. Walt Disney himself is one of the most important cultural figures of the twentieth century, and anyone who says ‘Disney is just for children' completely misses its impact in shaping the imaginations and therefore the cultural and political choices – of hundreds of millions.”


	“Whenever we investigate a subject, we always want to do more – we're frustrated we can't carry on,” added Holland. “With Walt Disney, we thought it only right to come to Disney – to Disneyland itself. Walt Disney, more than any other figure, embodies twentieth-century American culture, and Disneyland is a remarkable creation – one of the most influential architectural works of the mid-20th century.”

EXCLUSIVE: Comedian Mary Beth Barone is set to bring her first hour-long comedy special, Galaxy Brain, to Netflix.


	Coming on the heels of Thought Provoking, a 40-minute special that Barone self-released in April 2024, the hour will be directed by Ky Newman, taping at the Skirball in New York City on Thursday, March 19.


	Known on the stand-up side for her self-aware, darkly post-modern material, Barone is also a writer and actor who worked in both of those capacities on Overcompensating, the hit comedy series from Benito Skinner, Amazon MGM Studios and A24, which premiered on Prime Video in May and has been renewed for a second season.

	











Overcompensating is a college ensemble comedy following the wild and chaotic journey of Benny (Skinner), a closeted former football player and homecoming king who becomes fast friends with Carmen (Wally Baram), a high school outsider on a mission to fit in at all costs, while attending the fictional Yates University. Barone plays Benny's older sister, Grace.

	Barone has headlined sold-out shows at the New York Comedy Festival, Netflix Is a Joke Fest, and the Edinburgh Fringe. She is co-host, alongside Skinner, of the popular podcast Ride, and has performed twice as a stand-up on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.


	Barone is represented by Entertainment 360, UTA, and Jackoway Austen Tyerman.

Jennifer Aniston and Jim Curtis went Instagram official on Sunday.

The “Friends” star hard-launched their romance on the social media platform as she wished her boyfriend a happy birthday.

Alongside a sweet black and white photo of her hugging Curtis, the 56-year-old actress wrote, “Happy birthday my love. Cherished.” She also added a red heart emoji.

The image showed Aniston wrapping her arms around the 50-year-old love guru from behind, with both smiling, their hands intertwined.

The “Morning Show” star's gushing post comes nearly two months after she soft-launched their relationship by sharing a series of summer snaps. 

In a carousel of photos that included selfies with fellow “Friends” alum Courteney Cox, as well as Sandra Bullock, Adam Sandler and more A-listers, eagle-eyed fans homed in on the shot of Curtis toward the end.

In the photo in question, the hypnotist looked at the sunset at the beach with his back to the camera.

Aniston and Curtis' relationship first made headlines in July when they were photographed on Spain's Mallorca island with the Emmy winner's pal Jason Bateman.

The couple enjoyed a double date with Cox, 61, and her boyfriend, Johnny McDaid, in August.

And in early September, Aniston and Curtis were spotted going out in New York City.

Prior to her relationship with Curtis, the Golden Globe winner was married to Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux.

Curtis was married once before. He shares a teenage son named Aidan with ex-wife Rachel Napolitano.

Britney Spears deleted her Instagram account after making headlines for her erratic behavior that reportedly sparked serious concern from her family.

Spears' Instagram account was no longer available on Sunday, with a message reading, “Sorry, this page isn't available to view.” Instagram noted that “the page may have been removed.”

Her X account, however, is still available to view.

The pop star's surprising social media move comes after she was filmed swerving dangerously while driving herself home after a night out with a female friend late last month. At one point, Spears' black BMW convertible crossed the road's center divider in video obtained by Page Six.

However, a manager at Red O restaurant in Westlake, Calif., who attended to Spears and her friend before the “Toxic” singer got behind the wheel, said she was “not intoxicated” while dining at the upscale establishment.

“She was super chill and really nice,” manager Oliver Wynn told Us Weekly. “She just kind of hung out, grabbed a bite to eat and left.”

“I was impressed at how nice she actually was,” he added. “I worked at other restaurants frequented by a lot of celebrities, and I've never really seen a celebrity be as nice as Britney was.”

She later appeared to give her Instagram followers a bizarre excuse for her erratic driving.

“If anyone is wondering the lookalike was not me…🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤓,” she wrote on Instagram.

Still, the video of Spears wandering into other car lanes reportedly terrified her loved ones, who compared her behavior to her antics ahead of her 2007 breakdown, when she shaved her head and lost custody of her two sons — Sean Preston, now 20, and Jayden James, now 19 — whom she shares with her ex-husband, Kevin Federline.

“There's a lot of concern. Everyone has always wanted the best for her, and she's showing right now that she's making bad choices,” a source told the Daily Mail.

“It's terrifying,” the source added. “So there's a lot of talk about what to do, if anything. How can we protect her from herself.”

Spears was in the headlines last month due to Federline's tell-all memoir, “You Thought You Knew,” which aired out shocking accusations against the 43-year-old pop star.

She has hit back at his claims, and a spokesperson for her previously told Page Six that the former backup dancer is “profiting off her” after her child support payments ended.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Anthony Hopkins' wife speculates actor might have autism — but he thinks it's all ‘nonsense'","https://pagesix.com/2025/11/03/celebrity-news/anthony-hopkins-wife-speculates-actor-might-have-autism-but-he-think-its-all-nonsense/","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 13:18:00 GMT","

Anthony Hopkins revealed his wife believes he may be on the autism spectrum — but he thinks it's all “nonsense.”

The “Silence of the Lambs” actor, 87, told the Sunday Times on Nov. 2 that his wife of 22 years, Stella Arroyave, speculates he might be on the spectrum because he is “obsessed with numbers” and “details.”

He further explained, “I like everything in order. And memorizing. Stella looked it up and she said, ‘You must be Asperger's.' I didn't know what the hell she was talking about. I don't even believe it.”

Asperger Syndrome, per WebMD, is a term that's no longer used to describe a developmental disorder that's part of the autism spectrum disorder. People with this type of ASD tend to have a hard time relating to others socially, may stick to a very specific routine and have a narrow set of interests.

When pointed out that a “late-life neurodivergence diagnosis can […] often bring tremendous relief,” Hopkins said, “Well, I guess I'm cynical because it's all nonsense. It's all rubbish. ADHD, OCD, Asperger's, blah, blah, blah. 

“Oh God, it's called living. It's just being a human being, full of tangled webs and mysteries and stuff that's in us. Full of warts and grime and craziness, it's the human condition. All these labels. I mean, who cares? But now it's fashion.” 

“Oh, give me a break,” he concluded with a roll of his eyes.

The “Hannibal” actor then noted that, instead, he might have “some kind of embarrassment” about his job as an actor. 

“No, I've not done a stroke of work in my life. When I look at my life, the reality is I haven't had a good, decent job in my entire life. I've done nothing except show up, speak the lines and go home,” he said.

“People out there are digging the streets and working in shops and stores. That is real work. I haven't dug a street out. I've done nothing. I look at [myself] and think, ‘I haven't done a day's work in my life.' That's the reality.”

However, the world might beg to differ, as he is considered one of Hollywood's most prolific actors.

Throughout his career, Hopkins has received numerous awards, including two Academy Awards, four BAFTA Awards, two Emmy Awards and an Olivier Award. He also received the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2005 and the BAFTA Fellowship for lifetime achievement in 2008. 

He was also knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1993.

Hopkins' comments come after he opened up about the terrifying incident that led him to admit he was an alcoholic. 

In his upcoming memoir, “We Did OK, Kid,” the “Red Dragon” star wrote about the time in 1975 he drove from Arizona to Beverly Hills while blackout drunk.

“I could have killed someone,” he writes. “I could have taken out a whole family.”

That day, Dec. 29, 1975, he lost all “craving to drink” and started going to Alcoholics Anonymous. 

“We Did OK, Kid” is out tomorrow.

Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation and extortion countersuit against Blake Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, has been officially ended by the judge overseeing the case.

On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Liman entered a final judgement stating that Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios co-plaintiffs had declined to file an amended complaint, according to court documents obtained by Page Six.

Liman said he had contacted all parties in mid-October to warn them that he would be entering a final judgment to conclude the case, noting that Lively was the only one to respond.

The actress, 38, asked that her request for legal fees remain active, which Liman granted.

Baldoni's legal team tells us that he declined to respond so he could preserve his right to file an appeal.

Baldoni's January countersuit — as well as his $250 million libel lawsuit against the New York Times — were initially tossed out in June.

At the time, Liman ruled that Baldoni and his co-plaintiffs “have not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements in her [California Civil Rights Department] complaint, which are privileged.”

Lively first accused her “It Ends With Us” co-star and director of sexual harassment and retaliation in December 2024, going on to formally sue him later that month.

The New York Times was first to report on her claims.

Liman explained that Baldoni's countersuit “alleged that Reynolds and [publicist Leslie] Sloane made additional statements accusing Baldoni of sexual misconduct and that the Times made additional statements accusing the Wayfarer Parties of engaging in a smear campaign.”

However, Liman continued, “The Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Reynolds, Sloane or the Times would have seriously doubted these statements were true based on the information available to them, as is required for them to be liable for defamation under applicable law.”

Baldoni, 41, has continued to deny Lively's allegations against him.

Her case will be tried in March 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Hot-mess comedy I Love LA kicks off with frenemies, hangovers, and promise","https://www.avclub.com/i-love-la-premiere-recap","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 04:20:00 GMT","

From the moment I saw Rachel Sennott make holding a bagel with disquieting anger in Emma Seligman's Shiva Baby feel like both a setup and punchline, I haven't been able to shake off what the eventual star of Bodies Bodies Bodies, Bottoms, and, yes, The Idol could do for a wry laugh. And as the creator, writer, and lead of HBO's I Love LA, she doesn't disappoint. With her deadpan humor and penchant for embodying messy young women who are their own worst enemies, she's concocted a fitting love letter to this aggressively sunny city that opens with the most L.A. thing you can think of: an earthquake.

Not that Maia (Sennott) notices it all. She's much too focused on the sex she's having with her boyfriend, Dylan (Josh Hutcherson). Indeed, she's mistaking all the shaking around her for proof that she's having the best birthday sex she could've ever asked for (now if only he would choke her more). We learn plenty about this junior manager in this opening sequence: Maia may be unable to think outside of herself, but she's a pragmatist to a fault: “If we're gonna die, I just wanna come,” she tells him when he begins worrying this might be the big quake everyone in L.A. is always waiting on.

Maia, as we learn, is at a crossroads. She's turning 27, arguably a terrifying age for someone who's still trying to make her own mark in Los Angeles after leaving New York City behind a few years back. She already feels she's aging faster (she blames L.A. air). Thankfully, Dylan knows how best to navigate his girlfriend spiraling, redirecting her to focus on how skinny she looks now and her achievements at work. Now if only she got the promotion she's been angling for at the boutique agency she works at.

But first—and because this is a decidedly L.A. show—Maia has to go walking with her friends around the reservoir. Said pals are Charlie (Jordan Firstman, playing an L.A. Jordan Firstman-type gay) and Alani (True Whitaker, portraying your quintessential L.A. astrology girlie) who are stuck in what has to be the most 21st century discussion you can imagine: Should you block or mute a friend (or frenemy) you've had a fallen out with? There are clear pros and cons, especially because the person in question (Maia's old friend Tallulah) lives an extremely online life, what with being an influencer who once went viral for taking the subway in just a bikini (in a video that Maia took, no less). There's clearly bad blood, some money owed, and plenty of hurt feelings. It makes sense Maia would choose to just block her and avoid getting angry seeing how well Tallulah is still doing back in NYC, booking ad campaigns and clearly living it up.

Right now, she's stuck barely mustering enough courage at her job to ask her boss  (a fabulous Leighton Meester as Alyssa, who's getting her nails done while meeting with Maia) for a promotion. Presented with the Kafkaesque L.A. conundrum of “you can't really become a manager unless you have experience being a manager,” Maia is quick on her feet. Oh, but she is! To Tallulah Steele, who's been doing great lately. Only her ruse is foiled when Alyssa, looking at Tallulah's Instagram, realizes she's not following Maia and, seeing her phone ring (“Maybe: State Farm”), insists she has to get it and that they'll follow up later.

The day is clearly not going how Maia envisioned it. And it only gets worse. For guess who's waiting for her at home? Tallulah, who may well be a human hurricane. As soon as Odessa A'zion enters the frame it's like an electric jolt, her gorgeous curls, piercing eyes, and loud demeanor taking up all the space (and air) in the room. You immediately understand why Maia would equally love and loathe her. And she just doesn't have time for this at the moment. But Tallulah, who obviously got into an altercation at the airport when she left her bag on the plane and dared to go back (and still found time to steal tiny airport liquor bottles in the process—yes, she's that kind of mess) is elated to see Maia, at the apartment the two of them were once supposed to share had Tallulah gone through with their OG plan years ago to move together to L.A. It seems she was flown in by Alani as a friendly gesture to get them to make up.

Despite some protesting, Maia tries to make the most of it (watching Sennott calculate as Maia how best to still appear cool to Tallulah while also showing how incensed she is at the whole thing is just a thing of beauty) and eventually gets roped into going out for the night. Maia hates that Tallulah wants to go somewhere with a line (“They used to roofie people here but then they fixed it”), especially when she fails to leverage her new promotion (a lie, of course) to skip it and gets to watch her friend succeed, instead, by simply having met the owner out on the street. Where Maia's efforts go unnoticed, it seems Tallulah just skates on without any problems whatsoever. And that's how the two eventually get way too drunk, waking up hungover the next day and arriving late at Alani's, where Maia's birthday celebrations were to begin.

The day was supposed to be simple: bagels at Alani's, then Erewhon, and later a dinner at 7 p.m. Except that's all too boring for Tallulah: Why not go to the beach? (This is a basic non-Angeleno proposition. Does she even know how long that takes?) No matter, after donning one of Alani's swimsuits, Tallulah's convinced that's what they should do. Oh, and maybe move dinner to 8pm in case they do get stuck in traffic. It's all too much for Maia, who has become a guest star in her own birthday and just bails and says she'll meet them for dinner.

What follows is arguably the show's essence in a montage: set to Randy Newman's “I Love L.A.,” we get to see Alani and Tallulah have a fabulous day in Los Angeles (driving, walking around Erewhon, flashing the Scientology building on Fountain, thrift shopping—and yes, going to the beach) all while Maia is stuck trying to get her dinner reservation changed. This is a caricature of Los Angeles that, trust me, is also hilariously on-point, which seems to be the tone I Love LA is trying to strike.

And it all comes together at Maia's dinner, which turns out to be a surprise party of sorts (courtesy of Tallulah lying about it being her birthday, thus getting herself a suite and a cake with her name on it in exchange for a few Insta posts). This all drives Maia a bit insane and leads to the Tallulah vs Maia fight the episode was building toward: “L.A. is hard for a lot of people,” Maia insists, embittered. “Like I've been here, it's really isolating. It sucks. And you have to drive everywhere.” Meanwhile, Tallulah just waltzes in and makes it look easy. It's infuriating. Only Tallulah's life is not that great. She got dumped and is basically broke. (The scene, shot in a bathroom and increasingly giving us close-ups of Sennott and A'zion, is proof that Lorene Scafaria is a great director, understanding how best to capture the oppressive intimacy that exists between these two lifelong friends.)

And so, we have the setup for the show: What if Tallulah doesn't head back to New York? What if she stays and has Maia become her manager? What if they enjoy the cake together and relish dancing with the stripper they got for the party who soon enough is dancing up on Tallulah, all while Maia takes what I have to imagine will soon become incriminating pictures of an up-and-coming L.A. starlet? It's all a delicious kind of mess. And I cannot wait to see how it all unfolds.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Chair Company flashes back, but its best stuff is in the present","https://www.avclub.com/the-chair-company-recap-season-1-episode-4","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 03:45:00 GMT","

You can't have a conspiracy thriller without the conspiracy theorist, and The Chair Company has a doozy in Ron Trosper. He's an impulsive square with a hair-trigger temper, a destructive need for recognition and attention, and, most dangerous of all, unfettered internet access. We're compelled by Ron's quest to find order and logic in a disorderly and illogical universe, a trait he shares with other characters who've seen through the matrix and attempted to awaken all the sleepers around them. We laugh at Ron because of the teensy, tiny dimensions of the domino that's causing all the other ones around it to fall.

But do we need that explained to the degree that “Bahld Harmon Birthplace (Disputed)” does? Dipping in and out of flashbacks to Ron and Barb quitting their jobs to pursue their dreams, this is the series' most structurally adventurous episode to date. But it's shouldering a lot of plot, too, delivering Ron to a grandiose conclusion about what Tecca is hiding (opioids in the chairs). 

Meanwhile, we see a map of how we got to this point with glimpses from six and five years in the past, when Barb and Ron each, as mentioned, quit their jobs to pursue their dreams. She wanted to develop “a portable, stylish breast pump” (a.k.a. Everpump, which was referenced last week). We already know what he wanted to do, but now we get to see just how spectacularly his plans for a Jeep-adventure business imploded. The flashbacks are neat, casting the Trospers' big risk in the optimistic glow of sunlight through living-room windows and barroom Christmas lights. But I feel like if this is The Chair Company capitalizing on the length of its episodes and first season in order to flesh out its characters, then Ron using a spreadsheet to assemble his Pepe Silvia board illustrates just as much about him and his personality as viewing excerpts from his business' collapse.

And so the question “Is Ron seeing connections that aren't there?” runs headlong into the question “Is it enjoyable to know this much about what makes Ron tick?” At least his drunk declaration about showing the kids “that you don't have to settle—you can do what you love” grounds his actions in some sincerity. If we're going to spend four more weeks with this guy, I suppose we ought to be able to sympathize with him and his desire to make something of his life. We're clearly meant to connect the dots between his new obsession and his spinout over his expensive, potentially investor-concussing entrepreneurial failure. 

Natalie certainly does, with the episode's final flashback showing us what Ron looked like from his daughter's POV five years ago (read: bad times at the Trosper house). But it sets up a tricky balance for The Chair Company to maintain: to keep us laughing at Ron's outlandish behavior even though we know the concerns his family has about it and the all-too-human motivations behind it. Whatever happens after this week's episode, there's bound to be a tinge of tragicomedy.

Fortunately, there are still heavy doses of comedy comedy in “Bahld Harmon Birthplace (Disputed).” “That's really bizarre,” Ron remarks a couple of times while he sifts through the dirt he and Mike have gathered on Tecca. But his day-to-day life is plenty bizarre to begin with, punctuated by co-workers popping into his office to fret about the “treat” their boss has planned for later in the week (“Do you think it's going to be like a dessert or like a book?”) and a future daughter-in-law whose current work assignment involves making Wendy's new Almond Pimento Burger look photogenic. It continues to be fun to see where and when the Chair Company team decide to flex their sketch-comedy instincts within this type of serialized story. I can totally picture the goateed tuba mascot for Miss Maddy's Beignets causing trouble for Tim Robinson in an I Think You Should Leave sketch.

Here, however, Ron is tormented by an escalating series of online impersonations seemingly orchestrated by the Tecca people. They're all amusingly novel and (save for the email to Jeff demanding a raise and declaring a love of being paid money) harmless: first a fake eBay listing for some Beatles figures, later a couple of applications for modeling gigs. It's another game of proportionality, each little nuisance engineered for a big Robinson blow-up. This extends to the look and feel of “Bahld Harmon Birthplace (Disputed),” too: During the second of the modeling calls, Ron ducks into an empty office, and the camera shoots Robinson as if he's trapped in an impenetrable white void. A fake out later in the episode, blinding police lights, handheld cinematography, and some ominous clanging (plus, naturally, Robinson shouting at the top of his lungs) combine to create a sense of peril that's cleverly undercut by the reveal that the cops are there to collect a donation of one Big Green Egg.

Whether the heat is coming from the shadowy forces of Tecca or an HR investigation that has now roped in an outside observer to Ron's interactions with Amanda, he can't help but take it personally. In an episode full of priceless Tim Robinson reactions, my favorite is Ron's disbelief at the titular Bahld Harmon beating him out for the second modeling job. And when pressed about a yearbook photo that seemingly shows that Ron and Amanda hung out in high school, his response suggests he's offended at HR impugning his campus social standing, not his sense of honesty.

This is the truly illuminating material in “Bahld Harmon Birthplace (Disputed),” and it aligns with the righteousness with which Ron describes dissecting the Tecca chair to Natalie. That spiel and its accompanying montage of chair-part inspection and zoomed-in web pages are kicked off by Natalie telling her father that she admires how he's supporting his wife while Barb courts investors for Everpump. All this, plus the overriding paranoia that someone, somewhere, was out to get him with the faulty chair, shows how deeply Ron wants to be the center of attention. This is where the flashbacks are at their subtlest, what with Ron piggybacking on Barb's bold leap into the unknown and the way he talks about his dad. 

Well, joke's on him, because thanks to the nose he poked into Tecca's business, now he is. And with a head full of half-baked ideas about hydraulic levers, Hungarian exports, and pharmaceutical-company boards of directors, he's about to make sure that they're not the only ones keeping tabs on Ron Trosper. Fortunately for Ron, Natalie's got an eye on him, too. As we learn from the “Bahld Harmon Birthplace (Disputed)” flashbacks, she's been through this kind of thing before. But as we know from The Chair Company's present, she has no idea what her dad's conspiracy theory has dragged her into.

The Cure surprised no one by returning from a 16-year hiatus better than ever. It is The Cure after all. The band's 2024 release, Songs Of A Lost World, kicked off a new era for the group, with the band's 66-year-old leader, Robert Smith, continuing his 44-year mission to bring goth to the masses. But Smith and The Cure aren't through excavating the Lost World for sadness yet. Following the release of their latest LP, a live album, a remix album, and the band's extensive Lost World tour, the Cure is turning the record into a new concert film.

Directed by Nick Wickham, The Show Of A Lost World brings the band's album release concert at London's Troxy Theatre to movie theaters. Live-streamed last November, the show included a 31-song, career-spanning setlist, featuring the only performance of the Songs Of A Lost World album in full. The band also surprised fans with a five-song block of tracks from their 1980 sophomore album, Seventeen Seconds, as well as the hits “Friday I'm In Love” and “Boys Don't Cry.” The performance also became a live album, Songs Of A Live World: Troxy London MMXXIV.

The live stream introduced listeners to the album in its entirety, but it was still a very much a live-streamed concert that lacked the qualities necessary for a proper concert movie. They have a cure for that. The band says Wickham has recut and remastered the footage in 4K, with Smith himself remixing the audio for greater fidelity and a deeper sense of dramatic melancholy. There is perhaps no better way of navigating the Lost World.

The Show Of A Lost World hits cinemas worldwide on December 11, with tickets going on sale on November 20th. There will also be a DVD and Blu-ray release coming in late December.

In the snapshots, Heard is dressed as a witch with a pointy hat, while her daughter Oonagh Paige, 4, matches her in a black witch's outfit, striped tights and an orange sash.

Her newborn twins — son Ocean and daughter Agnes, born this year — both appear in festive hats (a spider and a pumpkin) and cozy outfits as they join the trick-or-treat outing. Heard captioned the post: “Halloweening with my minnies.”  

The occasion is striking for more than the adorable costumes.

It signals a period of family renewal for Heard, who has described motherhood as the “most humbling experience.”

The “Aquaman” actress made the sweet annoucement in a touching Mother's Day post.

She shared an image of her twins feet and a lengthy caption on what it means to be a mom of three.

A post shared by Amber Heard (@amberheard)

“This year I am elated beyond words to celebrate the completion of the family I've strived to build for years,” she shared. “Today I officially share the news that I welcomed twins into the Heard gang.”

Heard added that her whole world changed after her oldest child and thought she couldn't expreience any more joy. However, she revealed she could after her twins arrived.

“Becoming a mother by myself and on my own terms despite my own fertility challenges has been the most humbling experience of my life,” she added. “I am eternally grateful that I was able to choose this responsibly and thoughtfully.”

She concluded the message by adding, “To all the moms, wherever you are today and however you got here, my dream family and I are celebrating with you.”

Heard has maintained a quiet life since her divorce and highly publicized legal case with actor Johnny Depp.

The actress alleged that Depp was physically abusive, which Depp has vehemently denied. The trial lasted from April to June 2022, and Heard was ultimately found liable in all three defamation matters against Depp.

Since the trial, she moved to Madrid, Spain.

She spoke with “Today” host Savannah Guthrie in June 2022, according to E! News and expressed what she was looking forward to most.

“I get to be a mom,” she said at the time. “Full time, you know? Where I'm not having to juggle calls with lawyers.”

If you must report information about this woman could you please NOT post it on Johnnys Google page… thanks!

Fans of “The Dukes of Hazzard” are rallying around Catherine Bach, best known for her iconic role as Daisy Duke on the beloved CBS classic. The 70-year-old actress is currently hospitalized after suffering an embolism that reportedly developed following a recent surgery.

As news of her condition spread, Bach's former co-stars and longtime friends shared messages of love and prayers for her recovery. Ben Jones, who played Cooter Davenport, and his wife, Alma, were the first to break the news on Facebook. 

“Breaking news! Our dear Catherine Bach has just been admitted to the hospital in Los Angeles on an emergency basis,” they wrote. “Catherine has an embolism that probably developed as a result of a recent surgery. We will keep you posted… Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers. Love, Ben and Miss Alma.”

The couple added that Bach was heartbroken to cancel her scheduled appearance at Cooter's Place in Nashville, where she had planned to reunite with fans. “She is so, so sorry to have to cancel her appearance this weekend,” they shared. “Please keep her in your prayers.”

A post shared by Tom Wopat (@tomwopatofficial)

Tom Wopat, who played Luke Duke, posted a heartfelt tribute to Bach on Instagram, sharing a throwback photo of the pair from their “Dukes of Hazzard” days.

“Tom and the Wopat Webcrew are sending our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to Catherine Bach, who was recently hospitalized,” he wrote. “Wishing her comfort and a full, speedy recovery. ❤️”

Fans quickly filled the comments section with prayers and good wishes. “Get well soon, Legend. Wishing you a speedy and healthy recovery,” one wrote, while another added, “Prayers from Brazil, Catherine. We love you.”

John Schneider, who played Bo Duke, also reached out to fans with an encouraging update about Bach's condition.

“Attention, Dukes of Hazzard family! I just texted Catherine, and thankfully, she responded right away,” Schneider wrote on Facebook. “Yes, she is in the hospital, but she assures me that she is going to be fine. She appreciates all our prayers and support and is truly disappointed not to be traveling this weekend. We love you, Catherine!”

Fans echoed his positivity with messages like “Please Lord, let Catherine heal quickly” and “Praying for you, Daisy. You are the best!”

As Bach continues to recover, her “Dukes of Hazzard” family — both on-screen and off — is standing firmly beside her. Jones and his wife continue to post updates, thanking fans for their overwhelming support.

The 70-year-old actress remains beloved by generations of fans for her iconic role as Daisy Duke, the spirited cousin from Hazzard County who became a pop culture legend.

“I just texted Catherine, and thankfully, she responded right away,” Schneider reiterated. “She appreciates all our prayers and support.”

The show's tight-knit cast, along with fans around the world, are now rallying behind their Daisy Duke, sending prayers and strength for her recovery.

Please get well by the grace of God

Feel better fast! Hugs and blessings Catherine! In Jesus name. Amen

Jennifer Aniston isn't worried about keeping her love a secret. At least, not any more. She proved that on Sunday, November 2, when she went Instagram official with her partner and sent a special birthday message to her boyfriend, wellness coach and hypnotist Jim Curtis.

Popping up a black and white photo of herself and Jim on Instagram, the pic showed the actress standing behind her boyfriend with her arms wrapped around his middle. Jim smiles widely in the shot while Jennifer — who can barely be seen over her partner's shoulder — can also be seen with an adorable grin on her face.

“Happy birthday my love,” she wrote in the caption of the post. She also added, “Cherished ❤️”

A post shared by Jennifer Aniston (@jenniferaniston)

While Jennifer surely wanted to show her love for her boyfriend on his birthday, her fans and followers wanted to show their love for the couple.

One person wrote, “This version of you is my fav! Healthy, happy, successful and in love! You really deserve this Jen! 😍 Happy birthday to your love!”

“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh ❤️😍 You guys are very cute,” another person added.

A third person left a comment, saying, “OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG😍😍😍😍 FINALLY!!!!!! We have been waiting for this moment for a long time!!! 😫😫❤️”

Someone else wrote, “you are GLOWING! you go girl, you have us cheering for you forever n always. 🤍”

That's not to mention the person who left a comment, saying, “I cannot even explain how happy I am to see you happy my Jen Jen 🥹🫶🏼 HAPPY BIRTHDAY JIM 🥳🥳🥳 This post just made my whole week and it's not even Monday yet 🥹🥰”

A post shared by Jim Curtis (@jimcurtis1)

Just a few days before Jennifer's special birthday message, Jim took to Instagram to talk about finding love. Specifically, looking for a relationship in your 40s. However, what he had to offer seems like good advice for anyone at any age.

“First love yourself and recognize that you are the perfect age and that life is not over at 42,” he noted during a Q&A. “When you are 62 and 72, you will look back at 42 and wish that you were that age.”

“And today is a great day to start looking,” he continued. “Go out, open yourself to love and smile, connect with people and most importantly, love yourself.”

He added, “When you love yourself, you will magnetize more love to you.”

Erika Kirk is bravely opening up in her first sit-down interview since the tragic assassination of her husband, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk.

Erika will appear with Fox News host Jesse Watters on “Jesse Watters Primetime” this upcoming Wednesday, Nov. 5.

In a recent clip ahead of the episode, Erika started to cry as she watched a video of her late husband.

A post shared by New York Post (@nypost)

“Oh, he looks so good,” she began before the clip cut to after the video.

“Sorry guys, just give me a second,” she said as she began to cry. “This is the longest video I've watched of him. Just give me a second.”

In the brief clip that was shared, Erika also expressed how Charlie Kirk was the love of her life.

“I didn't sign up for anything. I just married the love of my life,” he told Watters.

The 36-year-old was named the new CEO of Turning Point USA after her husband's death.

The podcast host married Charlie Kirk in 2021. They went on to welcome their first child, a daughter, in 2022 and a son in 2024.

In a statement just two days after the assassination, Erika bravely spoke and revealed the sweet explanation she gave her daughter when she asked where her dad was.

“Baby, daddy loves you so much. Don't you worry,” she told her. “He's on a work trip with Jesus, so he can afford your blueberry budget.”

During the video, Erika also expressed how much family meant to her late husband. “Charlie always said that when he was gone, he wanted to be remembered for his courage and for his faith,” she said. “Most of all, Charlie loved his children, and he loved me with all of his heart.” 

Erika frequently shared rare moments with her children. In one touching post from Oct. 27, she shared a video of your daughter saying Charlie Kirk's name.

A post shared by E. (@mrserikakirk)

She wrote a heartfelt message with the video.

“[H]er…saying your name, as she witnesses all you've built and continue to build, proves that love never dies, just changes form. It breathes through our children. This is her legacy also,” Erika wrote.

She continued, “And as she grows up and continues to say your name, I'll be reminding her that each time Heaven leans in to listen.”

Thirty days after Charlie's passing, Erika shared how it has been since the tragic event.

“There is no linear blueprint for grief,” she began the lengthy statement.

A post shared by E. (@mrserikakirk)

“They say time heals. But love doesn't ask to be healed. Love asks to be remembered,” she added. “It's humbling to realize that this magnitude of suffering didn't steal my love for my husband. It amplified it. It crystallized it.”

The former Miss Arizona stated that she will carry Charlie's memory with her forever.

“I carry my Charlie in every breath, in every ache, and in every quiet act of day to day living as I attempt to relearn what that rhythm will be,” she continued.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jonathan Bennett's Husband Has Risky Role Behind the Scenes of 'Finding Mr. Christmas' (EXCLUSIVE)","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/jonathan-bennett-husband-finding-mr-christmas-tester/","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:40:29 GMT","

Being married to a Hallmark Channel superstar has its perks, but for singer-songwriter Jaymes Vaughan, who wed longtime Hallmark actor and producer Jonathan Bennett in 2022, it comes with some unique challenges, too.  

Vaughan has long been Bennett's biggest supporter, accompanying him to movie sets, on ad shoots, and at fan events. But in the spring of 2025, when filming began on the second season of “Finding Mr. Christmas” — the search for Hallmark's next leading man, co-created and hosted by Bennett — Vaughan indvertently landed his riskiest and funniest supporting role yet.

“I'm the guinea pig,” Vaughan told EntertainmentNow, revealing that Bennett and the production team enlisted him to try out each physical challenge before they put the 10 contestants to the test. Proving he'll do just about anything for his hubby, the assignment meant Vaughan wound up in all kinds of precarious situations, from hanging upside down in mid-air to sliding down a Crisco-covered hill. 

A post shared by Jaymes Vaughan (@jaymesv)

Ahead of the new season of “Finding Mr. Christmas,” airing Monday nights on Hallmark Channel, Bennett told EntertainmentNow that he was pumped to up the ante on each physical challenge that the 10 contestants faced, including a photo shoot that required the hunks to be suspended in mid-air, which is part of the new season's hilarious second episode, airing on November 3. 

“Like three or four days before filming, we have to test every challenge to make sure it works,” Bennett told EntertainmentNow. “I can't test it because, God forbid, something would happen to my face or I get hurt and can't film the show.” 

Vaughan quipped, “So make Jaymes do it!” 

“Well, if you look at our guys,” Bennett explained, “they're all like 225 pounds of muscle and, you know, Davey and Drake are six-four. Like, what are we going to do? Who are we going to get to test it? And Ilook around and go, ‘Well, Jaymes, is that size! Jaymes, can you do it?'”

“I'm as tall as the tallest guy and as heavy as the heaviest guy, so that's why it works,” Vaughan confirmed, adding, “But, also, that stuff is really fun. So I'm like, ‘I want to do it!'” 

In the November 3 episode, the remaining nine contestants are each assigned to portray a different member of Santa's reindeers — complete with brown leather pants, evergreen vests over shirtless chests (of course!) and antlers — while being hoisted in mid-air by a crane. 

With Bennett and fellow Hallmark stars Melissa Peterman and guest judge Heather Hemmens watching their every move, the contestants have to strike a pose for two celebrity photographers snapping away. But before they arrived, Vaughan went up first, figuring out what worked — and what didn't.  

“Everybody's standing around watching me, and I looked a little ridiculous the first time I went up,” Vaughan laughed about testing the “Reindeer Games” challenge. 

“The way they had put the harness on at first, you would completely just fall forward, no matter what you did,” he continued. “And, you know, the guys are gonna want to flex their abs up there. We moved the belt, played a bit with the harness. I was falling forward anytime I tried to, like, flex my abs and pose. But then I got it. So you knew it was gonna be difficult for the guys, but doable.”

The toughest challenge of the season, in Vaughan's opinion, comes in the third episode, when the contestants have to climb a “Slippery Slope” that's covered in grease. 

“I couldn't do it,” Vaughan told EntertainmentNow. “I spent 15 minutes on it trying to get up the thing. And it's like, the longer you're on it, the slipperier it gets, so it just gets harder and harder to get up. Think about it, your feet are covered in Crisco. Covered!” 

“It was hilarious,” Bennett laughed. “Jaymes was even trying to crawl up! And all of the producers are standing there watching. There's like, one guy with a stopwatch, and they're like, ‘Okay, how longis it gonna take them? Okay, that's too long, we have to use less grease!'” 

“You know, we have these crazy ideas for the challenges,” Bennett continued, “but we don't know what's really going to happen until we actually build the challenge and Jaymes goes through it.” 

Vaughan finally figured out a way to make it up the hill, so producers knew that they could move forward with the challenge. But just as hard, they later realized, was how long it took to get all of the grease off afterwards in the shower. 

“It literally took 30 minutes to get all that off,” Vaughan marveled. “Just think about it! You're covered in Crisco and baby oil or whatever it was. But again, it's so fun because, like, I got to do it all. I'm very happy to be the tester!” 

The next episode of “Finding Mr. Christmas” airs on November 3 at 8 p.m. Eastern time, and will be available to stream on Hallmark+ the following day. Featuring many of Hallmark's top stars helping Bennett and Peterman judge the competition as they face acting and physical challenges, the goal is to find the network's next leading man, who will appear in a 2025 Countdown to Christmas movie.

12 year have passed since Wong Kar-Wai‘s most recent film “The Grandmaster” was released, but North American fans of the legendary Hong Kong auteur are about to get a treat that makes up for the lost time. “Blossoms Shanghai,” the Chinese miniseries of which Wong directed all 30 episodes, is finally making its way stateside after airing in China in 2023 and 2024. 

Adapted from Jin Yucheng's acclaimed 2015 novel “Blossoms,” which is one of the only novels ever written in the Shanghainese dialect, the series follows a self-made millionaire (Hu Ge) who navigates the economic boom that accompanied the opening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange in the 1990s to become “the Jay Gatsby of Shanghai.” Ma Yili, Tiffany Tang, and Xin Zhilei also star in the series.

“I am thrilled to continue my long-standing relationship with Criterion with the North American debut of my first series on the Criterion Channel,” Wong said in a statement. “The series captures the vitality of Shanghai's roaring '90s, revealing universal human truths about desire and destiny. We hope the series provides insight into the pivotal moment of China's reinvention.”

While the bulk of Wong's films are set in Hong Kong, which he has long called home, the auteur was born in Shanghai. His films like “In the Mood for Love” and “2046” engage with Shanghai culture by following characters who left Shanghai for Hong Kong, but “Blossoms Shanghai” marks his first time setting a project in the Chinese city. 

The series was a massive hit when it premiered on the linear network CCTV-8 and the streaming service Tencent Video in December 2023, becoming the most streamed TV show in China and setting advertising records. It also aired on Jade Channel in Hong Kong. In addition to North America, Criterion Channel will also stream the series in UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. 

The first three episodes of “Blossoms Shanghai” will be available to stream on Criterion Channel at 8pm ET on Monday, November 24, with three new episodes dropping on the streaming platform each week through the end of January. Watch the trailer below.

HBO‘s “The Chair Company” is the latest hilarious dissection of midwestern office life from Tim Robinson and Zach Kanin, writers who have made a specialty of capturing the idiosyncrasies, camaraderie, and hostility of the workplace in shows like “Detroiters” and “I Think You Should Leave.” As Robinson‘s Ron Trosper falls down a customer service rabbit hole and uncovers a conspiracy, the show veers from mundane reality to darkly comic surrealism and steadily evolves into one of the best and most surprising TV shows of 2025.

For costume designer Nicky Smith, helping Robinson and Kanin deliver on the show's eccentric potential meant working against her natural inclinations. “I was thinking more about practicality and less about fashion,” Smith told IndieWire. “If the clothes were wrinkled or had stains, we said, ‘let's wash it, but not completely get the stains out. Let's keep the holes.' If the neck was pulled out because it was a really old shirt, we were like, ‘Ah, perfect.'”

Realism was the mandate from the beginning because Smith knew that in order for the show to work as it became more bizarre, there had to be a relatable baseline from which to start. “Tim and Zach and [director] Andrew DeYoung wanted the show to look as real as possible, so that when you see the jokes and the hijinks they're not expected,” Smith said. “It was really about making the world authentic.”

 










To find out how Ohio workers would dress, Smith scoured LinkedIn profiles and spent a lot of time on Instagram and Flicker looking for photos of family outings. She also bought a lot of the costumes at thrift stores that had the kinds of clothes she thought the characters would wear. “When it comes to the sourcing of the clothes we shopped at the stores people of this socioeconomic background would shop at,” she said. “For example, we were not buying the character of Mike Santini (Joseph Tudisco) nice clothes.  Everything's secondhand. Some of the pants were new, but they were a little ill-fitting, a little baggy in the legs.”

Smith also did a lot of thrifting for Robinson's character, especially when it came to his ties. “ When you find things that are thrifted, it's good for the environment and sustainability, but it also gives you clothes that have a life to them,” Smith said. “They're already worn, so the shoes look a little sad before the actors even put them on their feet. That's something that we can create, but it's almost easier and better to have it as is when you start the journey.” 

The main thing that Smith learned from her internet research was that when it came to workplace clothes, most people were going for function over fashion. “ It's less about the look, it's more about, ‘I have this thing to do. What should I wear to do my task?'” Smith said. “Looking at people in office attire, it's, ‘I need a sweater because the office is cold. I need a comfortable shoe because I may do a lap around the parking lot at lunch for exercise, and I need a bag so I can put my computer, my lunch, and my headphones in it.'”

 










Smith wanted to make sure the clothes looked lived in whether they were bought used or not. “We wanted the clothes to be clean, but not lose their authenticity,” she said. “If we bought things new — like some of Tim's pajamas and night shirts — we would double wash them in the washing machine with Cascade to break them down, and then we wouldn't steam them so it looks pilled, like a shirt that you've had for a year or two.”  

As Ron gets deeper and deeper into the underbelly of Ohio crime, his world starts to expand; Smith wanted to reflect that not only in his clothes, but in those of the people around him. “Him finding who he is outside of work activates other people,” Smith said. “You start to see people around the office with more varied silhouettes, wearing sweaters and dresses that they hadn't worn in the first few episodes, because as Tim is expanding and opening his eyes to the world, the world is opening up around him.”

One of the most impressive aspects of Smith's costume design is the fact that each character, no matter how small, has their own distinct look that still feels of a piece with the overall world. “That was the biggest challenge,” Smith said, “making sure that we were not using the same silhouette for everyone that comes into the show.  As you go further into the series, you start to see different people with a variety of body sizes and ages, and I wanted to make sure that everyone felt good in their clothes. The idea is not to look beautiful but to look authentic for the story, but I still wanted people to feel like their best selves in the clothes.”

 










While the workplaces in Robinson and Kanin's shows tend to be infected by passive-aggressive insults and power plays, Smith says one of the great pleasures of working on “The Chair Company” was the sense of community fostered by the showrunners. “The joy of working on a show like this is not only that it's really funny, but you're working with creators who care about their crew members,” Smith said. “Tim and Zach come on set and say hi to everybody, whether they're working with them personally or not. They made sure there was a real camaraderie on set, and you don't always get that.”

“The Chair Company” airs Sunday nights on HBO and is currently streaming on HBO Max.

1497, the nonprofit dedicated to boosting South Asian film and TV storytellers, has wrapped its fifth annual Features Lab.

The five-day Malibu retreat presented an impressive slate of mentors, including Ritesh Batra (“The Lunchbox,” “Our Souls at Night”), Nida Manzoor (“We Are Lady Parts,” “Polite Society”), Shuchi Talati (“Girls Will Be Girls”), Danny Alexander (Independent Artist Group), Suchir Batra (Zero Gravity Management), Nishika Kumble (Extracurricular), Raj Raghavan (ColorCreative), Urooj Sharif (Paramount), and Ameet Shukla (One Community), plus returning 1497 alumni Fatimah Asghar, Jaclyn Backhaus, and Jhanvi Motla.

The retreat's highlights included fireside chats with filmmaker Boots Riley (“Sorry to Bother You,” “I'm a Virgo”) and David Levine, chief content officer of Anonymous Content and former co-head of drama at HBO. The always-frank Riley joined for a candid conversation about the politics of art. Levine, meanwhile, gave participants an inside look at the changes in storytelling and within the industry in recent years.

 










The week also featured a hands-on workshop with Adrienne Weiss, best known as a directing and storytelling coach.

This year's 1497 Features Lab was supported by ShivHans Pictures, which is also committed to uplifting underrepresented voices and nurturing new perspectives in storytelling. Founder Shivani Rawat said, “I am honored to support 1497 to foster the South Asian talent who will create the stories of tomorrow for a more inclusive world of film and television.”

Since launching in 2020, 1497 has become a cornerstone of the South Asian creative movement in Hollywood. The organization is an official partner of the Sundance Film Festival, where it has hosted the 1497 South Asian Lodge since 2023. Past 1497 mentors include Mira Nair, Deepa Mehta, Gurinder Chadha, Zoya Akhtar, Nisha Ganatra, and Aneesh Chaganty, with industry guests including Tony Gilroy, Taika Waititi, Michelle Satter, Rajiv Menon, Rupi Kaur, Tan France, Poorna Jagarnathan, Guneet Monga, and others. 

“Five years in, this Lab has become the kind of space South Asian filmmakers have never truly had before,” said co-founders Adeel Ahmed, Lipica Shah, and Kamran Khan. “Our work isn't just focused on representation and authenticity — it's also about access. It's about building creative and institutional infrastructure behind the screen so storytellers in our community can thrive long after the Lab ends. Culture change doesn't only happen through who we see on screen; it's also through who gets to craft those stories.” 

 










Past 1497 alumni have gone on to staff writers' rooms, secure development deals, gain festival access and acceptance and entry to labs including Sundance, and have their projects optioned by leading studios.

The failure of the the law to protect people who need it, particularly refugees, has long been a subject of director Akio Fujimoto's work. His “Passage of Life” sees an undocumented Burmese become torn apart in Tokyo after circumstances force them to uproot themselves again and move to Myanmar, where the children have never lived, having been born and raised Japanese. 2020's “Across the Sea” concerns the exploitation of foreign workers, as it follows a trio of Vietnamese women working in Japan who are unable to get hospital treatment after their employers confiscates their passports.

 










“Lost Land” is Fujimoto's third link in this powerful chain of dramas concerning the extreme hostility of the establishment towards displaced people, this time focusing on the Rohingya, an Islamic people effectively without a country following genocide in Myanmar. The film concerns what it feels like to have no floor beneath one's feet; it's a film in constant, jarring, elliptical forward motion as it charts the journey of a Rohingya family from Bangladesh to Malaysia. (It also feels of a piece with the Tokyo International Film Festival competition title “Mother Bhumi,” also interested in the region's history, particularly towards the “various ethnic groups that were embittered against each other by the dictums of British rule.”)

Fujimoto's film quickly leaves the small comforts of home, as it watches children (real life siblings Muhammad Shofik Rias Uddin and Shomira Rias Uddin) play hide-and-seek before their aunt and uncle, frantically pack for their emigration; they immediately have to make unpleasant choices in leaving behind what material possessions they have in order to better care for the kids. The older sister, Somira — aged nine — is quickly and tragically forced to grow up in the space of a week as she finds herself responsible for her four-year-old brother Shafi during this harrowing exodus. Boat captains bark at the families to give up their phones and shut down what little expression the passengers can muster (one man sings “I wonder when I can return to our home country”). Later in the journey the family run afoul of smugglers in Thailand, which leads to an even more desperate situation as the children have to fend for themselves. 

Fujimoto shoots in an almost documentary-like, fly-on-the-wall style from the very beginning, but this isn't to say that the film is cold or analytical in its depiction of this story. The camera often orbits the children from their point of view, highlighting what they see and feel (such as the claustrophobia of the boat they board to Malaysia), and the flight-or-survival instincts they're forced to learn. Fujimoto deliberately makes the camera operator feel present in the scene being depicted as a kind of invisible witness: In some moments you feel the cameraperson stand up along with the characters, or in one scene where the children steal some bamboo out of desperation, they feel present as they run with them. The plight of the Rohingya is often discussed in terms of its scale, so Fujimoto's visual efforts to pare things down to a human level feel incredibly meaningful. 

 










The director pieces the film together in elliptical fashion. It starts with title cards announcing “Day One” and “Day Two,” but then suddenly skips ahead to “Day Eight” and then “Day Fourteen” as time begins slipping. A story from Somira's aunt about a mango tree which survived the burning of their village is met with the response of a dreamlike montage of the fire, narrated with a prayer for lost souls from the Qur'an. That sequence then slips to show that a passenger on the boat has died, specifically an old man who affirms that “compared to our past, this is nothing.” The torment of “Lost Land” is perpetual, never aestheticizing misery but rather operating in the sense that it mourns for those in the stories relayed to the director (Fujimoto worked directly with Rohingya people in the making of the film, which is notably the first to use the Rohingya language). Crucially, the tragedies of the film don't come from a sense of the filmmaker's cynicism, but from compassion.

That feeling is made clear in a sequence that's practically shot like the testimonials in a doc: a montage of Rohingya refugees discussing the dreams they'll achieve once they reach Malaysia. Those dreams include opening a car business, becoming a teacher, or in the case of the children, buying shoes and a hat. The film feels at its sharpest when the main family is embedded with other groups of refugees, which allows it to function as a window into a series of wider stories both about what the Rohingya refugees are forced to endure in their search for a home, as well as the outright hostility of the police towards them in various countries. Though interested and in some cases hopeful for its characters in rare moments of kindness and charity, there's no magical thinking to be found here, as the tragic final notes of the film's ending linger painfully even as one character clings to the memory of the aunt's mango tree, as though to make the point that while the sharing of stories can provide some kind of personal salvation, that salvation can only go so far. 

 










“Lost Land” premiered at the 2025 Tokyo International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Behind the masquerade, Chat Pile and Hayden Pedigo are dreaming of a kinder world. You could easily mistake the Oklahoma City sludge band's snarling songs about abattoirs and filicide as sadistic, but their most anthemic track is a raw entreaty to end the housing crisis, Raygun Busch's voice stretched and cracked as he screams, “Why do people have to live outside?” Pedigo, a fingerstyle guitarist from the Texas panhandle, has often played the trickster, but his antics have always been undercut by a deep empathy. A joke campaign video he made at age 24 for a seat on the Amarillo, Texas City Council sparked an earnest bid for office against an elitist incumbent. And in recent years his Instagram grid has transitioned away from photos of himself dressed as highway billboards to open-hearted mini-essays about stage fright, grief, and why he writes essays on Instagram.

Shared compassion is at the core of Pedigo and Chat Pile's new collaborative album, In the Earth Again. Imagining this experiment between any of the titans the two acts have respectively been compared to—John Fahey and the Jesus Lizard, or William Tyler and Eyehategod—is fun, but the common ground seems slim. Chat Pile and Pedigo's fusion occurred last summer, when Pedigo moved from Amarillo to a house a few blocks from Chat Pile bassist Stin in OKC. And when Pedigo pitched the idea of working on a single together, Chat Pile raised the stakes to a full LP. Rather than a split—the bread and butter of the metal-industrial complex—or a Chat Pile-featuring-Pedigo record, this album is the product of a seamless synchronicity, two seemingly opposed forces combined into a single, interpenetrated entity.

In the Earth Again is set at a glacial pace, allowing each element to coalesce in its own time. The first two tracks descend into murky purgatory: Instrumental opener “Outside” is led by Pedigo, his plaintive guitar backed by additional axe work from Chat Pile guitarist Luther Manhole, Busch, and Cap'n Ron, who traditionally handles percussion but plays a powerslide lap steel on some of these songs. That track flows seamlessly into “Demon Time,” a hypnotic number in which Busch prophesies the burning of all the castles in the world and the return of every demon. “And they will find you/And they will fuck you up,” he sings, his voice low and even. Despite their tranquil sound, “Outside” and “Demon Time” are all tension, no release. So when “Never Say Die!” begins with a bulldozing power chord and a nuclear kick—the first percussion on the record—it's pure catharsis. It's the most characteristic Chat Pile cut on the album: sludgy, detuned, and merciless.

The rest of In the Earth Again alternates between vocal-centric songs and instrumental tracks. “Behold a Pale Horse” is a Pedigo/Manhole duet full of lovely counterpoint curdled by reverb. “Fission/Fusion” begins as a noisy, jolting scrum before settling into something more Metallica adjacent. And “I Got My Own Blunt to Smoke” finds Busch alone with his guitar, seemingly interpolating Timbaland. It's only a five-note descending scale, but Busch draws out its melodrama to an almost cartoonish degree. It's hard to imagine that, in light of the goofy cultural references he's sprinkled across Chat Pile's past work, he doesn't know exactly what he's doing.

Where field recordings and tape loops make indelible contributions to the record's atmosphere, they fall flat on its eight-minute centerpiece, “The Matador.” “Things fall apart!” Busch yowls several times, and it's here Chat Pile and Pedigo's shared sensibilities hold together least. They open the song with nearly two minutes of tape loops before the drums, bass, and guitar build gradually into a monster lick. The music chugs ceaselessly but loses its punch on the home stretch. There's a great four-minute song here, but the long closing guitar solo is gratuitous, as is the sluggish intro.

In the Earth Again is best at its simplest, in the singer-songwriter tracks at the middle and end of the record. In “The Magic of the World,” Busch's disarmingly tender voice sits center-stage. “Before the life goes from my eyes/Before all magic is lost to time,” he sings, “You're here with me/One more time/Until the world ends.” Then “Fission/Fusion” enters with a roar, ripping a hole in his revery. On closing track “A Tear for Lucas,” Busch stands alone again, addressing a dead friend directly. He sounds naked, stripped of his jaded façade as he sings, “You once shared the saddest thing/To cheer me up/And it haunts me.” In 14 words, he sketches a loving but troubled relationship and describes the echoing trauma of a single interaction. It's in these songs—softer and sweeter than anything in Chat Pile's catalog, gloomier and more foreboding than anything in Pedigo's—that their mutual empathy radiates strongest.

In 2013, Daniel Avery made a name for himself in the techno world almost overnight with Drone Logic, the UK DJ and producer's sprawling debut album. While rooted in club culture, the album appeared interested less in playing with propulsive rhythms than with a fusion of acid and ethereal melodies, creating an atmospheric push-and-pull with each track. At the time, Avery was known in London circles primarily through his residency at Fabric, where he performed under the alias Stopmakingme before using his real name. Since Drone Logic, Avery has released a string of projects that, although varied, haven't strayed far from the electronic realm, from 2020's more ambient-leaning and contemplative Song for Alpha to 2022's intense, breakbeat-infused Ultratruth. But Avery's newest album, Tremor, his first in three years, sees the artist trading the solitude of the electronic producer for the collaborative spirit of a rock band.

In some ways, this represents a return to his roots. Avery's work has always been shaped by early influences such as Nine Inch Nails, Deftones, and My Bloody Valentine. Avery's first taste of DJing came as a teenager warming up the decks at a local indie club night called Project Mayhem, where he spun everything from electroclash to post-punk, before he was taken under the wing of mentors like Erol Alkan and the late Andrew Weatherall, both renowned for bridging the worlds of rock and dance music.

While Ultra Truth featured electronic peers like Kelly Lee Owens, HAAi, and Manni Dee, Avery's sixth solo album pulls from a completely different group of contemporaries, including the Kills' Alison Mosshart, Quicksand and Rival Schools' Walter Schreifels, yeule, and yunè pinku. Tremor's production still remains distinctly Avery, lined with acid-tinged bass and a brooding, psychedelic sound. But these elements tend to lay the groundwork for a smattering of voices enmeshed in swirling guitars, rather than standing out as the main show. When Tremor holds your attention, it works—but sometimes Avery gets lost in his own trance, drifting away from the album's rough pulse just as it begins to take hold.

The record opens with “Neon Pulse,” inviting the listener into a dreamy, orchestral world that flows seamlessly into “Rapture in Blue,” where singer Cecile Believe's delicate vocals breathe air into slowed-down breakbeats. Guitar melodies lurk, waiting to pounce, on “Haze,” featuring Ellie, which bleeds into “A Silent Shadow,” featuring bdrmm—and they do, with a fierce clash of drums and electric riffs. While Avery has emphasized the distinction between his recorded output and his work as a DJ, the shape of Tremor's tracklist mirrors a set that gradually builds, shaping a pyramid stacked with desire. While the album's grit is softened by the rounded, flowing synths on “A Moon Starts Shaking,” it comes at the cost of interrupting Avery's teeth-grinding flow at a pivotal halfway point.

When asked about his particular taste, Avery has only been able to whittle it down to “music that sounds unreal.” And an otherworldly, electric current runs through Tremor, which, at its best, showcases Avery's skills at reshaping the textures of his collaborators into new, distinctive forms. Mosshart's sultry vocals melt into the muddied synths of “Greasy Off the Racing Line,” while yeule's plaintive pleas grow even more wistful against the backdrop of Avery's hazy, immersive production. And on the album's most distinctly shoegaze-influenced track, “In Keeping (Soon We'll Be Dust),” Avery creates a playful melody that gives shape to Schreifels' earnest vocals before exploding into loudspeaker fuzz. The song's instrumental parts flow into “Tremor,” where they are meant to stand alone. Yet as it stretches on, it begins to drag, and Schreifels' absence is keenly felt.

The album's penultimate track, “A Memory Wrapped in Paper and Smoke,” creates an orbital soundscape that brings us down to earth and nods to opening track “Neon Pulse,” the only other song created solely with Avery's long-time collaborator James Greenwood. But Avery doesn't close out Tremor by tying it in a neat little bow. Instead, he makes his departure on “I Feel You,” with Art School Girlfriend, like he does behind the decks: with a grand, synth-heavy crescendo—taking you higher and higher, out of your world and into his.

Mark Fell has spent much of his career building castles out of splinters. Or their digital equivalents, anyway: The Sheffield native's music is an amalgamation of shards, fragments, and slivers of electronic sound sculpted into dazzling arrhythmic bursts. Composed on software platforms like Max/MSP, his pieces are rigorously formalist in nature, their shapes largely determined by the interaction of elements within closed systems. Even in the absence of understanding just what makes his music tick, one intuits the action of inscrutable processes at work, arcane rules generating sequences that unspool at the speed of black MIDI. To listen to Mark Fell often feels like standing in the shadow of the mathematical sublime.

Still, while the effects may be bracing, titles like Periodic orbits of a dynamic system related to a knot suggest a cool-headed researcher in the background, his hands stuffed in lab-coat pockets while his machines whip themselves into a frenzy. As he recently told Tone Glow of his approach: “It's less about the construction of emotion or meaning or storytelling and more about foregrounding the characteristics of the process and technology.”

But Fell's new album Psychic Resynthesis marks a major shift in his work: It was written for, and performed by, the players in Explore Ensemble, a London chamber group appearing here as a sextet for flute, clarinet, piano, violin, viola, and cello. This isn't the first time he's written for human musicians; his 2018 album Intra, for an ensemble of microtonal metallophones, was recorded by percussionists interpreting software-generated audio patterns, which they listened to on headphones while playing. But Psychic Resynthesis feels new for Fell: a recognizably “classical” piece whose tonal makeup echoes 20th-century composers like Morton Feldman and Giacinto Scelsi, and whose structure is rooted in Cagean chance operations.

The piece opens with a held note on the cello that at first I mistook for the opening of Pablo Casals' recording of the Bach cello suites. A scratchy violin figure drifts over the top; the violist tersely jabs away at a single string while the pianist repeats a series of softly dissonant tone clusters. As is often the case in Fell's work, there's as much silence as sound. Musical phrases drift like solitary clouds through an empty sky: plucks and scrapes, reedy bleats, strings that creak like rusty hinges, drones that sound like the air being let out of a balloon. Sounds and ideas come and go, triggering accidental collisions and incidental harmonies, but there is no apparent structure or logic. Nearly an hour and a half long, the piece feels less like a composition to be followed than a space to inhabit—a room to enter and occupy for a while, picking up random objects and setting them back down at your leisure, feeling neither uncomfortable nor completely at ease.

The numerical titles of the album's 10 tracks—things like “Combination #1 ( • | 6 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 6 )” and “Combination #4 ( 7 & 3 | 3 | 7 | 6 & 2 | 1 | 2 & 6 )”—once again seem to indicate that some serious number crunching is going on under the hood. That's not entirely true, although few people not named Mark Fell are likely to decipher exactly what is happening on tape. Originally given the title Every non-empty ultra-connected compact space has a largest proper open subset, the original composition upon which this recording is based assigns seven “behaviors,” or sets of actions, to each player in the ensemble—a particular chord, say, or a sequence of notes, or a glissando along a string—for variable amounts of time. According to coded instructions assigned by the score, the players' actions are designed to overlap in unpredictable and non-repeating ways. There are some other quirks, too: For one thing, performers are instructed not to rehearse together or even discuss their respective parts. And the durations of each action remain open-ended; as dictated by the score, one part might be as short as 10 minutes or as long as 10 hours—a daunting prospect, to say the least.

For all the emphasis on process, it hasn't been made very transparent for listeners of the album. (That I know this much is thanks to Fell's explanations during a recent Bandcamp listening party for the album.) And Fell himself seems to have played fast and loose with the rules: Although Psychic Resynthesis is based on the original piece's collection of assigned “behaviors,” Fell recorded each artist separately and, disregarding assigned durations, simply collaged together the results in a way that sounded good to him. It's a relief that he's not dogmatic about his systems. Rather than insisting on an hours-long endurance test, he seems willing to let listeners off the hook: We just get to sit back and enjoy this bizarre, not entirely intentional soundscape.

And it is, truly, enjoyable. In its cryptic changes, tangled quasi-repetitions, and contrasts between the soft and the spiky, the piece has an odd effect. I find it impossible to listen to closely; invariably, my attention wanders. But get inside it, even for a spell, and you may feel like you've gone away for a while. Time dissolves; the conscious mind atomizes.

Another new recording, Fell's Nite Closures EP, offers an entirely different experience. It's the first release on a fledgling label with a wonderfully stone-faced name—the National Centre for Mark Fell Studies—which the artist has said will be reserved for his solo electronic music, mostly in EP form. The record's five tracks are more in keeping with the bewildering beat-based music of records like his Gábor Lázár collaboration The Neurobiology of Moral Decision Making, cobbling together deep-house pads and footwork syncopations into wildly lurching behemoths that seem to defy the very laws of physics, with balletic grace.

“Nite Closures (extended dub)” begins with the glistening iridescent synths of Fell's Sensate Focus era before contorting itself into a nine-minute barrage of seemingly non-repeating beats. “Nite Closures (version)” is even more frenetic, spinning Errorsmith-like rubber-band noises into a singeli-tempo maelstrom. The bulk of the record's remaining tracks are nearly as disorienting; what I find particularly appealing are the strange, iridescent drones that hover in the background, glistening like oil slicks. Much like Autechre, Fell appears to be testing multiple limits at once: the speed of his beats, the possibilities of his tools, the ability of his listeners to make sense of what they're hearing. Yet for all the obvious difficulty of his music, on a track like the shuddering “large modulos #3,” the beauty he conjures—awe-inspiring, breathtaking, incomprehensible—is undeniable.

George Clooney has no regrets about penning a New York Times op-ed calling for former president Joe Biden bow out of the 2024 presidential election. However, the actor now says it was a “mistake” for Kamala Harris to step in as the new candidate. 


	Speaking on CBS' Sunday Morning, Clooney acknowledged that he would write the op-ed again in hindsight. “We had a chance,” he said. “I wanted there to be, as I wrote in the op-ed, a primary. Let's battle-test this quickly and get it up and going.”


	He continued, “I think the mistake with it being Kamala is she had to run against her own record. It's very hard to do if the point of running is to say, ‘I'm not that person.' It's hard to do, and so she was given a very tough task. I think it was a mistake, quite honestly. But we are where we are. We were gonna lose more House seats, they say. So I don't know. To not do it would be to say, ‘I'm not gonna tell the truth.'”


	Reporter Seth Doane then asked Clooney if he saw Hunter Biden's aggressive response to the op-ed. Clooney confirmed he had, saying he could spend “a lot of time debunking many of the things he said.” These included the claim that Barack Obama had put Clooney up to it, which Clooney said is untrue.

	“But the reality is I don't looking backwards like that is helpful to anyone, particularly to [Hunter],” Clooney said. “I think don't think it's helpful for the Democratic party. And so I'm just going to wish him well on his ongoing recovery and I hope he does well and just leave it at that. I have many personal opinions about it, but I don't find it to be helpful to have a public spat with him.”

	











	Elsewhere in the interview, Clooney explained of his decision to voice his opinion publicly, “I do it when I think I have a responsibility to, quite honestly.” He added, “My father always told me to challenge people with more power than you and protect people with less power. … I believe in that. I teach our kids that.”

	Last July, Clooney authored a much-read op-ed in The New York Times calling for Biden to step down, writing that “the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.” “We are not going to win in November with this president,” the actor wrote. “On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and Congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private.”


	Eleven days later, on July 21, Biden dropped out of the presidential race and backed Harris, who Clooney subsequently endorsed.

S
ince 2018, Russell Simmons has been living the life of a well-heeled holy man primarily in Bali, cultivating an aesthetic that falls somewhere between Eat, Pray, Love and alternative-medicine practitioner. Calling himself a yogi and professing wellness expertise — he has been promoting his 2015 vegan cookbook on Instagram — the Def Jam Recordings co-founder posted an exuberant selfie with a group of apparent religious pilgrims earlier this year, with the caption: “The goal is self discovery when one knows the self she/he makes life a moving prayer.… he should practice living in prayer ❤️ and one day in this lifetime or the next all suffering stops…” This introspection has also served as a business opportunity: Simmons is a founder and investor in the Gdas Bali Health and Wellness Resort, “the destination for devotional and wellness practitioners,” he wrote on Instagram.  


	His Instagram account is filled with dedications to his family, yoga mentors, and old-school rapper friends — “It has probably been at least one year since I missed 8 am meditation,” he wrote in August — with Simmons noting recently that “Govinda das Ananda (god's blissful servant) was the name given to me by krishna,” and writing that one woman's introduction to yoga and meditation “inspire[s] me to keep serving.”

	











	However full the pioneering hip-hop mogul's island life might appear, his relocation came amid numerous sexual-misconduct allegations back in the United States. For more than a year, Simmons' continued residence in Bali dovetailed with allegations that he had yet to pay agreed-upon settlements to at least five women who have accused him of sexual misconduct.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Wendy Franco, Sil Lai Abrams, and Sherri Abernathy said in court papers filed in October 2024 that for more than a year, Simmons hadn't paid 2023 agreements of more than $3 million total. Specifically, Simmons had agreed to pay Franco $515,000, and Abrams and Abernathy $1,265,000 each.

	Abernathy alleged that Simmons raped her in 1983, while Abrams claimed Simmons raped her a decade later in 1994. Franco has not publicly made claims against Simmons, but according to settlement paperwork filed in court, the settlement relates to alleged “physical injuries and sickness.” Documents filed in the legal proceedings also show that as of January 2025,, Simmons also owed a total of at least $8 million to three other accusers: Tina Klein-Baker, Toni Sallie, and Alexia Jones. These filings from earlier this year claimed that Simmons had paid only $220,000 total to them. (A firm spokesperson for Klein-Baker's lawyer, Kenya Davis of Boies Schiller Flexner, said that “at this stage of litigation, the attorneys and clients could not comment.” The attorney for Sallie and Jones declined to comment and declined to make them available for this article.)


Rolling Stone sent a detailed list of questions related to the allegations of abuse and nonpayment to multiple attorneys representing Simmons. Simmons, through one of his attorneys, Imran Ansari, declined to comment. Two days after Rolling Stone sent Simmons questions for this article, a lawyer for Franco, Abrams, and Abernathy told Rolling Stone, “The matter has been resolved,” but declined to provide any additional details. Lawyers for Simmons did not reply to additional inquiries on the nature of the resolution, and it remains unclear what conditions and parameters, if any, are included in the resolution or how much money, if any, the women have received.


	Meanwhile, Simmons has gone on the attack in response to allegations against him. This summer, he filed a defamation suit against HBO and Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick, the filmmakers who produced On the Record, a 2020 documentary featuring interviews with several Simmons accusers. (Simmons' lawyer claimed “credible information, persuasive evidence, [and] witness statements” supporting Simmons were “disregarded” in the making of the film. HBO's parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, said in a statement to Rolling Stone that the lawsuit “lacks both merit and substance” and that they “stand behind the documentary.” The suit is ongoing.)

	The settlement papers with Franco, Abrams, and Abernathy do not detail specific accusations — like Franco's, the other two settlements reflect that “[t]he Settlement Amount constitutes a payment for damages for Claimant's alleged personal, physical injuries and sickness” — nor does Simmons admit wrongdoing in the settlements, which state that his payment does not imply “any admission of liability, fault, or wrongdoing.” Sallie and Jones' settlements also state that the agreements do not admit any liability of wrongdoing, nor specify exact allegations.


	In interviews with Rolling Stone prior to the resolution, Franco, Abrams, and Abernathy largely described Simmons' apparent delay in payment as another emotional blow in the already-arduous process of legal action against him. His nonpayment, which spanned more than a year at the time of these interviews, felt like another trauma.


	“It was devastating,” Franco said in an April interview with Rolling Stone, before the resolution. “I just felt so stupid that I thought this person would follow through, that I thought that someone who could do what he did would turn around and acknowledge me and make some type of amends. You exposed yourself to this, and now this person again shows you that it doesn't matter to him.” 


	Simmons has said that “I own no property in the United States,” and has cried poverty in filings. His legal team, in a defamation suit filed by former music-industry executive Drew Dixon, who accused him of rape in 2017, said in September that he owes them more than $100,000 in fees. (Simmons has denied Dixon's claims.) The attorneys also said that Simmons is unable to pay a $15,000 penalty imposed by the court on his legal team for missing a scheduled court hearing.

“You exposed yourself to this, and now this person again shows you it doesn't matter to him.”


	Dixon's lawyer, Kenya Davis, shot back that Simmons has money, urging a New York judge to ignore Simmons' “palpably false and self-serving claims of poverty.” Davis said that Simmons has a 75 percent stake in the Gdas resort and noted his “ongoing partnership with and ownership interest” in a Singapore-based talent agency.


	Resolved or not, Franco, Abrams, and Abernathy's years-long financial purgatory also exemplifies the unfulfilled promises of #MeToo. Women were encouraged to take action against men who had allegedly harmed them — often upending their lives in the process — only to find that the financial and emotional relief in coming forward might be ephemeral at best, nonexistent at worst. Simmons' protracted nonpayment also reflects the logistical perils and broader challenges for anyone navigating the legal process. People can willingly enter into settlements — as Simmons did — but if they don't pay, enforcement of these agreements could spiral into a labyrinthine and prolonged legal fight. 


	“It could be indefinite,” says Daniel Tabak, a partner at the New York law firm Cohen & Gresser who focuses on bankruptcy and was not involved in any Simmons cases. “There's no guarantee that [plaintiffs] will ever be able to collect.”


	Meanwhile, Simmons' financial liabilities don't seem to have impeded his movements. On Aug. 11, he posted a video of himself and a fan to his Instagram shot in New York City. “NYC can be so magical,” he wrote. “Just met this wonderful young lady. She is full of love <3.”

	











	For years, Franco dealt with her pain personally and alone, and tried as best as she could to avoid thinking about Simmons. “I did not follow Russell Simmons in any way. I was very averse to him and everything about him,” she says. Then came #MeToo. 


	While Franco declined to discuss the specifics of her allegations — “Ms. Franco is reluctant to elaborate on her claims against Mr. Simmons, given his penchant for litigation,” her attorney, Andrew Wilson of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel, tells Rolling Stone — she spoke openly prior to the resolution about the deep emotional toll of Simmons' apparent failure to pay the settlement. 


	“A lot of people were writing about their experiences with powerful men having abused them,” Franco tells Rolling Stone. She had come across accounts of women speaking out against Simmons and had learned about a documentary on him while it was already in progress. “I missed my opportunity to be in this film because it had already been done,” Franco says. “It was a letdown.”


	Franco contended with economic and family hardships from a young age. The 50-year-old came to the U.S. with her family from the Dominican Republic at age 11, and describes the move as “a lot of trauma.” She and her siblings were separated and scattered into foster homes during the immigration process. Franco says she was “pretty much living on my own by the age of 14” and staying with friends in New York.  


	She wanted to act, but her dyslexia and need to learn English on her own scared her from reading in public. But Franco, who ultimately became enmeshed in the downtown New York City arts world, taught herself by “reading The Outsiders with a dictionary, listening to the Smiths, and translating.”


	The resilience carried forward. Franco kept up with Simmons' accusers through social media and discovered the Adult Survivors Act. The 2022 New York state law created a one-year window for adult survivors of sexual misconduct to file civil claims against their alleged abusers that otherwise would have exceeded the statute of limitations. “It felt like divine intervention,” she says, sometimes twirling a ringlet around her finger when she speaks. “It felt crazy and it worked out. I felt like a little bit of my history was validated. It was amazing.”


	The settlement addressed a sense of dehumanization that had weighed on her for years. “It's like a life-shifting, life-changing trauma that makes you doubt who you are and your value and your worth, and it means so little to the person who traumatizes you, who abuses you; it means nothing to them,” she says. “They might not even fucking remember it. So to have that person have to admit, even if it's just to get you off their back, that you existed … it's incredibly important.”


	Abernathy — who as Sheri Sher was a founding member of the pioneering all-female hip-hop group Mercedes Ladies — describes a sense of empowerment in her decision to come forward. The 64-year-old former rapper still delivers her words enthusiastically, often smiling as she recalls the group's music. She tells Rolling Stone that she worried about reprisal amid her already turbulent life had she come forward back in the 1980s. Abernathy's family, consisting of her mother and 10 siblings, constantly faced eviction in New York City. Writing was her solace. She was frequently scribbling in black-and-white-speckled notebooks, covering one side in rhymes and the other with diary-like missives.

	











	During one eviction, Abernathy recalls, city marshals took her composition book. “That really hurt me,“ she says. She crossed paths with Simmons a few times while she was pushing hard for Mercedes Ladies' success. She has previously said that Simmons attacked her one evening after luring her to his office under the false pretence of a business conversation. 


	Abernathy alluded to the alleged rape in her 2008 autobiographical novel, Mercedes Ladies, but did not name Simmons despite her friends' encouragement to do so. She mulled naming him for four months, but ultimately decided against it. “I felt that if I came out,” she tells Rolling Stone, “I would have a lot of trouble on my hands.”


	That changed in late 2017. Following allegations against Harvey Weinstein that October, more women were coming forward with sexual misconduct claims against powerful men in the entertainment industry, including music, notably leading to the conviction of R&B star R. Kelly and sprawling allegations against Marilyn Manson. (Manson has denied the claims.)


	Model Keri Claussen accused Simmons of sexual assault in a November 2017 article in the Los Angeles Times. Less than two weeks later, screenwriter Jenny Lumet alleged in The Hollywood Reporter that Simmons sexually assaulted her. Three women, including Dixon, accused Simmons of rape in a Dec. 13, 2017, New York Times article. (Simmons is fighting Dixon's defamation suit, in part by insisting that his broad denials of sexual misconduct on a podcast did not directly name her.) 

“I felt that if I came out [in 2008], I would have a lot of trouble on my hands.”


	That same day, Abernathy was one of five women who accused Simmons of misconduct in a Los Angeles Times article. “I never really expected that all these women would come out. I thought I was the only one,” she says. “When it came out, I felt a little bit of empowerment behind it. I thought there was never gonna be justice, but justice did come out.”


	Simmons has repeatedly denied the claims, saying in 2017 that “these horrific accusations have shocked me to my core, and all of my relations have been consensual.” He apologized in another statement for being “thoughtless and insensitive.” Weeks earlier, he said that he had “never committed any acts of aggression or violence in my life. I would never knowingly cause fear or harm to anyone.” 

	











	The settlement “wasn't about money,” says Abernathy, noting how she didn't name Simmons despite her book coming out at the height of his fame. “I'm not a money person. I always worked and kept paying my own way.” For Abernathy, who recently retired after working as a New York state court officer for 20 years, the settlement meant that Simmons was “being held to account for his actions.”


	Abrams, a writer and survivor advocate, says she was surprised that there might be any way to get justice. “When I first heard of the Adult Survivors Act, I was shocked that it would even pass. I always held reservations about it as a mechanism for justice, because I know how extensive sexual victimization is in our society,” she says. “We treat it as if it is this aberration, and while it is aberrant, unfortunately it is common. And one of the things we've learned from #MeToo was how widespread this issue is. It's not something that just happens on the fringes of society.”


	Abrams, who has said that she came from a chaotic home, told The Hollywood Reporter that she met Simmons in 1989. She had moved to New York City the prior year, and was working as a nightclub hostess. (She also worked as an executive assistant at Def Jam in 1992.) A few years after meeting Simmons, they had sex at various points. In 1994, Abrams saw Simmons for what she believed was a platonic meeting. She had previously told him she no longer wanted a sexual relationship and he agreed to that, according to her interview with The Hollywood Reporter. When they were out that night, Abrams has previously said, she was drinking alcohol while Simmons drank sparkling water, claiming he was sober. 


	Later that evening, Abrams asked Simmons to direct his driver to bring her home, but she was driven to his apartment instead. Abrams said that she passed out on his bed with her clothes on. Abrams, who has said she was wavering in and out of consciousness, alleged that Simmons raped her despite her repeatedly saying no, and then directed her to leave his apartment because he was waiting for a romantic interest to call him. 


	In November 2023, it seemed like things would finally come to a close for the three women. Simmons signed settlements with Abrams, Abernathy, and Franco and agreed to an October 2024 deadline for payment. These settlement agreements were confidential — meaning that the women were legally barred from disclosing the amount or even the existence of a potential settlement. Nobody would know that he paid the women a dime, obviating the possibility of additional bad press. As part of these settlements, Simmons also signed paperwork attesting that he owed them the settlement money and confirming the payment deadline. 


	Because these statements effectively validated the settlements, they should have expedited enforcement. The statements also stipulated that if Simmons didn't pay, the women's attorneys could file these statements — and the total amounts owed — in court and make them public. 


	Simmons blew past the deadline without paying any of the women. The women's attorneys filed these statements in October 2024, publicly revealing that he had brokered confidential agreements, alongside the amounts. “I was looking at my phone every day,” Franco says of waiting for Simmons' payment. When she spoke to her attorney at the deadline and learned that he hadn't paid, “it was devastating.”  

	











	“It just made me feel crazy. I cried for days. I was completely incapacitated,” she tells Rolling Stone. “I didn't work for a little bit, and not because I'm melodramatic and [not because] I'm a fucking take-to-my-bed person.” Franco was angry. The burden of that limbo, she says, was “like an anchor.”


	Abernathy voices similar sentiments. After a “very tedious and long” process, she and Simmons had come to an agreement, and for her, it seemed like it would be as over as it could be. “I thought, and I'm quite sure the rest of the girls thought, that Russell was going to keep [his promise].” When he delayed payment for more than a year, all the while leaning harder into his Zen vibe and luxe tropical lifestyle on social media, “it was just like living a nightmare over and over.”

“How do you go from the godfather of hip-hop to this broken, cornered animal on this tiny island? That's quite sad.”


	Last spring, Abernathy underwent brain surgery for an aneurysm and was “in the hospital fighting for my life.” As a result, Abernathy says she must avoid stress and keep her blood pressure down. She also needs a clear head for a hopeful Mercedes Ladies project. “I didn't want myself to get upset,” she said at the time of the ongoing nonpayment. “I didn't want to start crying again.”


	Abrams says the past year touched on her longstanding reservations about the legal process: “With the Adult Survivors Act, my concern was that once these cases began to be settled through the civil courts, a pushback would come [with] the narrative that had always existed: that the intention of a survivor coming forward is monetary gain.”


	She says she still decided to give it a shot, going into the negotiation “with an open mind.” She was baffled at Simmons' delay in upholding the agreement, saying the situation “just [kept] him tethered to all of us.”


	“How do you go from the godfather of hip-hop to this broken, cornered animal on this tiny island?” Abrams says. “That's quite sad.”

	











	Abrams says the entire situation points “to the limitations that civil suits can have on actually bringing survivors some measure of justice that's intended.”


	The whole point of coming to a settlement is to avoid lengthy lawsuits and trials that can cost both sides more money. Most settlements include confidentiality clauses that not only conceal the settlement figure, but also bar anyone involved from publicly discussing it. When someone doesn't pay, collecting the owed money isn't as straightforward as sending an angry letter. The person with the purse strings could decide to stall or skip out on their tab. Attorneys can take them to court. A judge can order payment. Banks can be forced to comply. But if the money isn't readily available, getting it becomes a challenging process.


	“A sophisticated, wealthy defendant often can hide their assets in a way that makes it very difficult for plaintiffs to collect,” explains Tabak, the Cohen & Gresser lawyer who helmed Hulk Hogan's legal team in Gawker's bankruptcy, resulting in a $31 million settlement. 


	The state of Simmons' finances remains unclear. For years, Simmons has been fighting his ex-wife, Kimora Lee, in court over millions of dollars in Celsius energy drink shares that the feds want to seize following the money-laundering conspiracy conviction of Kimora's ex-husband Tim Leissner. (Through a rep, she declined to comment for this article.)


	How exactly the Celsius case will play out is unknown — a recent court filing suggests that Simmons and Kimora might have come to some sort of agreement that's yet to be finalized — but at the very least, Simmons has tens of millions on the line. Three of his accusers — Sallie, Baker, and Jones — have appeared in court filings as “interested parties” in the Celsius case, though it's unclear if any of the disputed money would go to his accusers. 


	Wilson, Franco's attorney, has subpoenaed a business firm that works with Simmons for information about his finances. He has also subpoenaed one of Simmons' daughters, Aoki Lee Simmons, for financial information. Wilson's firm also sent Aoki Lee a letter dated April 4 warning that if she spent any of her father's money, she could be on the hook for his nonpayment. (A rep for Aoki said he was not able to reach her for comment.)


	Resolution aside, the months of waiting both took a toll and prompted questions for the women. “He has his freedom, technically, but he's trapped in a prison of his own making, mentally and otherwise — he's not dealing with reality,” Abrams said in July. “The reality is: He owes a significant number of people a significant amount of money. And that's not going to get wiped away just because he chooses to hide on an island in the ocean.”

	A new class action lawsuit against Spotify alleges the company has “turned a blind eye” to “mass-scale fraudulent streaming” on its platform and that one musician in particular has been the beneficiary of “billions” of fake streams: Drake.


	The suit was filed in California District Court on Sunday night with rapper (and cousin of Snoop Dogg) RBX named as the lead plaintiff. While the most eye-popping allegations in the suit relate to Drake's streaming numbers, there are no specific accusations of wrongdoing against the “Nokia” rapper. Only Spotify is named as a defendant. 


	“Every month, under Spotify's watchful eye, billions of fraudulent streams are generated from fake, illegitimate, and/or illegal methods,” like bots, the lawsuit states. Such “mass scale” streaming fraud, it continues, “causes massive financial harm to legitimate artists, songwriters, producers, and other rightsholders.” 


	Streaming royalties are paid out through a “streamshare” model, where subscription and ad dollars are put into a giant pool, with the money divvied up based on each artist's share of the total streams. Most of that money already flows upstream to the most successful artists and biggest rights holders. In this type of shared-pool model, fake streams hurt other artists whose shares aren't inflated.

	“We cannot comment on pending litigation. However, Spotify in no way benefits from the industry-wide challenge of artificial streaming,” a Spotify spokesperson said in a statement. “We heavily invest in always-improving, best-in-class systems to combat it and safeguard artist payouts with strong protections like removing fake streams, withholding royalties, and charging penalties. 

	











	“Our systems are working: In a case from last year, one bad actor was indicted for stealing $10 million from streaming services, only $60,000 of which came from Spotify, proving how effective we are at limiting the impact of artificial streaming on our platform.” The spokesperson included a link to Spotify's page on artificial streaming.

	While the lawsuit suggests that use of bots is widespread on Spotify, the only example it cites pertains to Drake. It claims “voluminous information” which Spotify “knows or should know” proves that a “substantial, non-trivial percentage” of Drake's approximately 37 billion streams were “inauthentic and appeared to be the work of a sprawling network of Bot Accounts.” (A representative for Drake did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)


	This allegedly fraudulent activity took place between January 2022 and September 2025, according to the complaint. It claims an examination of Drake's streams revealed “abnormal VPN usage” had obscured the location of the bot accounts streaming Drake's songs. For instance, the lawsuit claims that over a four-day period in 2024, at least 250,000 streams of his song “No Face” originated in Turkey “but were falsely geomapped through the coordinated use of VPNs to the United Kingdom in [an] attempt to obscure their origins.”


	The lawsuit also alleges that “a large percentage” of accounts streaming Drake's music were “geographically concentrated around areas whose population could not support” such a high volume of streams. No exact places or numbers were given, though the suit claimed that some streams reportedly originated in areas with “zero residential addresses.” 


	The lawsuit also cites “significant and irregular uptick months” for Drake's songs long after they've been released, as well as “slower and less dramatic” decay rates for Drake's music compared to his contemporaries. (Decay rate refers to a typical streaming pattern where plays of an album or song naturally dwindle in the weeks and months after release.)

	The lawsuit further claims that “the number of streams of Drake's music attributable to individual accounts is staggering and irregular,” with a “massive amount of accounts listening to Drake's music” doing so “23 hours a day.” Less than two percent of these users, the lawsuit goes on to claim, account for “roughly 15 percent” of Drake's streams; and about about nine percent of Drake's streams “are attributable to less than one percent” of these users. 

	











	“As a result,” the complaint claims, “Drake's music accumulated far higher total streams compared to other highly streamed artists, even though those artists had far more ‘users' than Drake.” 


	The lawsuit does not state how the plaintiffs, or their lawyers, obtained this data, nor does it shed any light on how the analysis of Drake's streaming numbers was conducted.


	These allegedly fraudulent streams “generated significant revenues” for Drake and his company Frozen Moments, at the expense of other artists, the lawsuit claims. But it also states that Spotify “deliberately turns a blind eye to fraudulent streaming” for its own benefit. 


	While Spotify has taken steps in recent years to combat and tamp down streaming fraud, the lawsuit casts doubt on the efficacy of these measures and Spotify's own incentives to stop fraud. It suggests that Spotify is particularly vulnerable to bots on the platform's ad-supported free tier because myriad accounts can be generated without handing over a credit card number. By allegedly allowing bots to run rampant, Spotify can present high stream and user activity numbers to potential advertisers, the lawsuit alleges. 


	“For Spotify, more users and music streams means more advertising dollars, so long as the true origin of the streams remains hidden,” the lawsuit states. (Spotify also loses money in the form of royalty payouts whenever fraudulent streaming occurs.)


	“Artists across the streaming industry need accurate reporting of streams and effective fraud detection to ensure fair compensation. When streams are artificially inflated on a large scale – as my client's lawsuit alleges has happened with respect to streams of Drake's music – it affects the income of countless songwriters, performers, and producers,” Mark Pifko, one of the lawyers with Baron and Budd, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of RBX, tells Rolling Stone. “The lawsuit seeks to address these broader issues, recoup losses for affected musicians, and make the streaming ecosystem as fair and transparent as possible for everyone involved.”


	The new lawsuit — and the claims regarding Drake's music — notably come just weeks after a judge tossed Drake's lawsuit against Universal Music Group, which contained its own allegations of streaming fraud. Though technically a defamation case, Drake accused his own record label UMG of artificially inflating the popularity of Kendrick Lamar's diss track “Not Like Us,” marking arguably the most high-profile allegation of streaming fraud to date. UMG denied all of Drake's allegations and the streaming fraud claims specifically, writing in a March legal filing, “There is no evidence of any such stream manipulation.”

	











	Streaming fraud has been a topic of discussion in the industry for years. While pinpointing just how rampant it is — and calculating corresponding losses — is difficult, most estimates hover in the range of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars. A 2019 Rolling Stone report noted that fake streams could be costing artists $300 million a year. A 2023 study in France found that between one and three percent of all streams in the country were fake. If those numbers held true globally, that would mean royalty losses up to $510 million. Last year, Beatdapp, a streaming fraud detection program, estimated that at least 10 percent of all streams are fraudulent, leading to annual losses of $2 to $3 billion. 


	Efforts to crack down on streaming fraud have ramped up around the world. A Danish man was convicted last year, while another individual was arrested in Brazil back in March. Over the summer, officials in Turkey — where the lawsuit says some of the allegedly fraudulent Drake streams originated — started investigating Spotify over several allegations, including bribes for playlist placement and bot streams distorting domestic charts. (A rep for Spotify told Music Business Worldwide at the time that they are “cooperating with the investigation, are actively seeking to understand it, and will work toward a swift, constructive resolution with the Turkish Competition Authority.”) 


	And in the U.S., federal prosecutors brought an unprecedented streaming fraud indictment last September against a North Carolina musician named Michael Smith. Smith is accused of using artificial intelligence to generate hundreds of thousands of songs, which he then allegedly streamed with bots. The feds claim that, at one point, Smith had as many as 10,000 active bot accounts streaming his music, and allegedly made over $10 million from this scheme. (Smith has denied the charges.)


	Drake filed his first legal claims over “Not Like Us” just two months after Smith was arrested and indicted, and the official defamation suit was brought in January of this year. The streaming fraud allegations against UMG were based on statements from a purported anonymous whistleblower, who appeared on a show by DJ Akademiks, the popular streamer and longtime Drake associate. As stated in Drake's lawsuit, the whistleblower claimed that Lamar's label, Insterscope (a UMG subsidiary), paid him $2,500 “via third parties” to “use ‘bots' to achieve 30 million streams on Spotify in the initial days following” the release of “Not Like Us.” Per the suit, the whistleblower said the goal was “jumpstarting” the song's spread and making it “a crazy hit” on the platform.

	











	UMG, in a motion to dismiss, noted the whistleblower “directly refuted” his own claim when he said that he was hired by Lamar's manager, Anthony Saleh. In a revised complaint filed in April, Drake pared down his allegation, claiming “UMG was aware that third parties were using bots to stream the Recording and turned a blind eye, despite having the power to stop such behavior.”


	The original suit also alleged that UMG “conferred financial benefits” to Apple so that Siri would “purposely misdirect users to” “Not Like Us” when they asked it to play Drake's album, Certified Lover Boy. This claim was sourced partly to a viral video posted by HipHopDX's Jeremy Hecht, who later clarified that Siri appeared capable of pulling up songs based on just lyrics it recognized. Thus, asking Siri to play Certified Lover Boy — without specifying “by Drake” — could conceivably trigger “Not Like Us,” because of Lamar's line, “Certified loverboy? Certified pedophiles.” 


	Even before Drake filed his defamation lawsuit, many legal experts and industry figures were skeptical of his allegations and their viability in court. Speaking with Rolling Stone last year about the petition, Brian Zisook, co-founder of the streaming service Audiomack, even suggested Drake might regret asking Universal to provide documentation of artificial streaming. 


	“It's likely that a lot of artists, Drake included, have benefited [from streaming bots] without their knowledge,” he said. Zisook also noted that many top artists have labels and distribution partners who have “opted into above-board programs like Discovery Mode and have artificially manipulated streams, and the artist has no idea. And they don't ask questions because it looks good.”


	Ultimately, Drake's suit faltered. A judge summarily dismissed the suit's defamation accusations, ruling that “Not Like Us,” as a diss track, qualified as “nonactionable opinion.” And while the judge's decision largely centered on the validity of Drake's defamation claims — or lack thereof — she also briefly addressed his streaming fraud allegations. She said Drake's evidence essentially amounts to “Tweets by individual users and reporting from fans,” and called his “reliance on online comments and reporting insufficient to meet the plausibility standard.”


	The proposed class action filed Sunday claims damages in excess of $5 million. It's asking that a federal judge certify the lawsuit as a class action, order Spotify to identify alleged victims, and oversee a jury trial seeking compensatory and punitive damages.

	











	RBX, born Eric Dwayne Collins, helped author Dr. Dre's West Coast anthem “Let Me Ride” and was featured on several tracks for Dre's seminal album The Chronic.

US congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has sparked controversy after telling television host Bill Maher that unidentified flying objects may actually be 'fallen angels' rather than alien spacecraft.

The Georgia Republican insisted that demons are real and suggested that UFOs could belong in that category, accusing parts of the US government of concealing the truth.

Appearing on the 1 November episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, Greene was asked whether she believed demons exist. She replied: 'Absolutely. I'm a Bible-believing Christian. And I believe those could be fallen angels.'

When Maher pressed further, asking if she thought aliens might be fallen angels, Greene said: 'That's possible. I think that's what they could be. That's what makes sense in my worldview.'

During the discussion, guest filmmaker Dan Farah referenced claims from senior US military officials who allegedly believe some UFOs may be demonic rather than extraterrestrial. Greene did not challenge that theory.

She also addressed her previous Facebook posts linking wildfires and space lasers, claiming she had been unaware at the time that some of the parties mentioned were Jewish.

Greene went on to suggest that the government is not being truthful about UFOs. She accused officials of keeping Congress in the dark about the nature of such phenomena and claimed that any spiritual dimension to the sightings is being deliberately hidden.

Her remarks contrast sharply with official investigations by NASA and the Pentagon, which have focused on scientific explanations for unidentified aerial phenomena rather than supernatural theories.

Nonetheless, Greene's comments highlight a growing intersection of politics, religion and conspiracy, which has increasingly shaped the American debate on UFOs.

Critics say Greene's latest remarks fit her broader pattern of provocative and conspiratorial beliefs, from her earlier claims about 'space lasers' to repeated suggestions of government cover-ups.

Yet, her willingness to merge theology with extraterrestrial theories has again made her a viral talking point online, especially among audiences sceptical of mainstream science.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tells Bill Maher she believes UFOs could be fallen angels“I think [UAP] is a serious issue.”“People deserve to know the truth.” pic.twitter.com/1xH761Dele

Just another ignorant person that has no clue what her own Bible says! If the UFOs in the sky were of malevolent ETs none of us would be here. It's incredibly annoying how something so simple is so hard for people to understand!!!

Demonic spirits are absolutely obsessed with human suffering and death. Septian is their primary tool, so of course weird things could easily be demonic activity.Her terminology is off, but what she said is biblically accurate.But honestly, the stuff humans are up to is more…

News outlets have described Greene's remarks as highly unusual for a sitting member of Congress. The Guardian noted that her appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher 'highlighted her belief in demons and her suggestion that they may be aliens who fell from heaven'.

Her claims have been met with scepticism from members of the scientific community, who warned against confusing religious belief with unexplained aerial phenomena.

Across social media, Greene's comments quickly became a trending topic. Critics condemned what they saw as the blurring of theology and science, while supporters praised her for speaking openly about spiritual realities. Others viewed her statements as another example of her long-running flirtation with conspiracy theories.

The timing of Greene's remarks coincides with renewed public fascination with UFOs. The popular tracking app Enigma has recorded more than 30,000 reported sightings since 2022, including thousands of mysterious underwater anomalies off US coastlines.

For some, the surge in sightings highlights the need for deeper scientific investigation. For others, it only intensifies speculation about hidden truths — whether governmental, extraterrestrial or spiritual.

Times of San Diego


					Local News and Opinion for San Diego				

San Diego has a way of hiding odd and fascinating stories beneath its well-known attractions. Beyond the beaches, theme parks, and bustling harbor, the region has a history full of quirky incidents, unexpected innovations, and feats of engineering. Here are five little-known tales that reveal a side of San Diego most visitors never hear about.

1. The Plunge's Swimming Scandal (1940s)Mission Beach's iconic saltwater pool, the Plunge, sparked controversy when city officials swapped the saltwater for fresh water in the 1940s. Locals were outraged, missing the ocean-like swimming experience they had grown to love. Despite the uproar, the Plunge endured and remains a cherished part of San Diego's recreational history.

2. UFO Wave of 1947While Roswell often gets all the attention for UFO sightings, San Diego had its own summer of mysterious aerial phenomena. In 1947, numerous residents reported seeing “flying discs” over the county. Local newspapers speculated about secret military experiments or extraterrestrial visitors, leaving behind a chapter of quirky local lore.

3. The Birth of the San Diego Zoo (1916)Dr. Harry Wegeforth founded the San Diego Zoo after animals imported for the 1915 Panama-California Exposition were quarantined. Unable to release them, Wegeforth envisioned a permanent zoological park. He reportedly told his brother, “Wouldn't it be wonderful if we had a zoo?” That vision became one of the world's most renowned zoos, attracting visitors from around the globe.

4. The Rise of the Tuna Industry (1920s)The 1920s saw San Diego emerge as a hub for tuna fishing and canning, drawing workers from across the country. This booming industry helped define the city's maritime identity and left a lasting mark on the region's economy and culture.

5. The Goat Canyon Trestle (1932)In the rugged desert of Carrizo Gorge stands the Goat Canyon Trestle, the largest wooden railroad trestle in the world. Completed in 1932, it was called an “impossible railroad” due to the difficult terrain. Though no longer in active use, the massive structure endures as a testament to early 20th-century engineering and ambition.

These stories show that San Diego's history isn't just sunny and scenic—it's also strange, surprising, and full of hidden gems waiting to be discovered.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=paranormal","See Who's Starring in Paranormal Activity in London's West End","https://playbill.com/article/see-whos-starring-in-paranormal-activity-in-londons-west-end","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 15:19:00 GMT","

The original film, released in 2009, reimagined the found footage genre for a new generation, kicking off a blockbuster franchise.

Melting Pot's stage adaptation of the Paranormal Activity horror films has found its West End cast.

The already extended limited run, which will begin performances December 5 at the Ambassadors Theatre, will continue through March 28, 2026. Felix Barrett directs.

Inspired by the horror film franchise, the new play is directed by Punchdrunk Founder and Artistic Director Barrett, and written by playwright Levi Holloway, whose theatrical thriller Grey House played Broadway in 2023. The original Paranormal Activity film, released in 2009, reimagined the found footage genre for a new generation, grossing nearly $200 million worldwide and kicking off a blockbuster franchise spanning six sequels. The play, aimed at audiences 15 and above, again reimagines the modern ghost story by reinterpreting the original domestic horror with theatrical illusion.

For the production, Melissa James will reprise her role as Lou, alongside fellow performers Pippa Winslow as Carolanne, and Jackie Morrison as Etheline Cotgrave. The West End company will also welcome Ronan Raftery as James. Understudies for the production will include Cheyenne Dasri and Jake Solari.

The production will have set and costume design by Fly Davis, illusions by Chris Fisher, lighting design by Anna Watson, sound design by Gareth Fry, and video design by Luke Halls. Casting is by Stuart Burt and Ginny Schiller.

Paranormal Activity is produced by Simon Friend and Hanna Osmolska for Melting Pot in association with Gavin Kalin, Ken Davenport, Jenny King, Patrick Gracey, Jonathan and Rae Corr, and Leeds Playhouse.

Are we truly alone—or just unable to hear anyone else? A NASA scientist suggests alien civilizations may exist, but their technology could be far less detectable than we've long assumed.

Enrico Fermi's decades-old question—“Where is everybody?”—remains one of science's most haunting mysteries. If the universe is teeming with stars and planets, and life has evolved on Earth, why hasn't it happened elsewhere in a way we can detect? For many researchers, the so-called Fermi Paradox is a puzzle that demands fresh approaches rather than grand assumptions.

Paul M. Sutter, astrophysicist and science communicator, digs into this question in a Popular Mechanics feature, drawing heavily from a recent paper by NASA scientist Robin Corbet. Corbet's “A Less Terrifying Universe,” published on the arXiv preprint server, challenges our longstanding ideas of advanced alien civilizations and offers a less dramatic—but more grounded—explanation for the quiet cosmos.

One of the core arguments Corbet raises, in his paper, is that our expectations of alien technology are shaped more by science fiction than science. From cinematic flying saucers to galaxy-spanning empires, popular culture has created an image of extraterrestrials far beyond what physics or engineering currently allow.

According to Corbet, even if advanced alien societies do exist, their technology may not differ significantly from ours—at least not in the detectable ways we assume. According to Popular Mechanics, Hollywood imagines aliens as having flying saucers capable of beaming humans into the sky. We don't have anything close to that, and by that logic, they wouldn't either. This more restrained view of technological progress suggests that alien civilizations might not be broadcasting strong signals, launching visible megastructures, or traversing the galaxy at impossible speeds.

This perspective reframes the entire search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). If other civilizations are using low-power communications or simply not interested in contact, we might never know they're there—even if they're relatively close.

Distance remains a primary barrier in any attempt at interstellar communication. While the nearest star system, Proxima Centauri, is just over four light-years away, even that modest stretch poses monumental challenges.

Voyager 1, the farthest human-made object, is currently more than 15 billion miles from Earth. Traveling at 38,000 miles per hour, it would still take roughly 75,000 years to reach Proxima Centauri, according to the article. Corbet uses this to highlight a simple truth: If our most advanced spacecraft can't span the gap, why should we expect alien vessels to do so either?

And radio signals, though faster, degrade over distance. Once they travel far enough, even Earth's strongest transmissions blend into the general galactic background. As Sutter explains in the same source, “By the time even our most powerful broadcasts… reach Proxima Centauri, they are so weak that they can no longer be distinguished.” Interstellar space is noisy, full of radiation from exploding stars and charged particles. In that context, alien messages—even if they exist—may arrive as nothing more than static.

Even if advanced civilizations had emerged and expanded in the past, their traces could easily be lost in the sheer size and age of the Milky Way. The galaxy spans over 100,000 light-years and contains hundreds of billions of stars. In that context, the presence of even a million colonized systems would be barely noticeable—a statistical rounding error.

Paul M. Sutter writes that an alien empire inhabiting a million worlds would still account for “less than 0.001 percent of all the stars in the entire Milky Way galaxy.” Furthermore, civilizations—even highly advanced ones—may exist only for brief periods when measured against the universe's 14-billion-year history. Humanity's own urban existence spans a few thousand years, a mere blink on the cosmic calendar.

According to this view, the reason we don't see alien ruins or hear alien voices may be that the universe is too vast and too old, and intelligent life—no matter how advanced—is simply too temporary to leave lasting footprints on a galactic scale.

The Séance of Blake Manor
Developer: Spooky Doorway
Price: $20
Platform: PC
MonsterVine was provided a PC code for review.

The Séance of Blake Manor is a new supernatural detective mystery from Spooky Doorway, the developer of the comedy adventure game The Darkside Detective and its sequel. I loved both Darkside Detective games, so I was intrigued by what they would do in a more serious story. You play a private investigator called to Blake Manor, where a group of people have gathered to perform a special séance. One attendee has gone missing, and your goal is to secretly investigate her disappearance while pinpointing who the culprit might be.



It's an adventure game in which you explore from a first-person perspective. You can examine things and talk to people in your search for clues, but your actions take time. Moving from place to place doesn't cost anything, but actions such as investigating something in the environment or asking someone about a piece of evidence do. Common actions like these cost one minute, while lengthier events such as attending lunch take more time. You have until the night of the séance to find the answers you need, so you'll want to learn the other characters' plans and pay attention to scheduled events to make sure you don't miss anything important.

Fortunately, the time limit isn't as strict as it first appears. The early part of the game gives you strict deadlines to emphasize the importance of choosing your actions carefully, but after that, it opens up considerably and gives you the freedom to investigate as you wish, with much greater margin for error than you might first expect. It really just comes down to thinking carefully about your actions. You don't want to examine every single item in a room, but if you inspect a few unimportant things, it won't mean the end of the world. The one downside is that sometimes a conversation topic that seems inconsequential will yield important information when you ask the right character, so you can't be too afraid to ask about conversation topics, either. Once again, it allows for more freedom than it first appears. I find time limits stressful in most games, but this one didn't bother me. If you do end up hitting a point where you need to restart, you can restart from a save file to start from any previous hour.



As you gather information, you'll be able to make connections between different clues and piece together the secrets that each character is hiding. Once you gather all the relevant clues about a specific lead, you can form a hypothesis by filling in the blanks. If your hypothesis is about a character, completing it lets you officially confront them with your newfound information, which leads to some great character moments and heartfelt scenes. Some characters' stories are intertwined, so if you reach a dead end with one, you might need to investigate someone close to them. Together with the importance of watching characters' schedules and paying attention to time, this approach to gameplay really makes it feel like you're doing detective work.

It also has a great atmosphere for the supernatural side of things. I was surprised at first at how overt it is about the supernatural. It isn't long before you learn that several people in attendance are practitioners of magic, and Irish mythology and folklore play an important role. There are ghost sightings, mysterious dreams, and ominous implications that something terrible might happen at the séance. On top of that, you'll also take a direct role in the supernatural aspect of the game by solving puzzles where you have to trace magical sigils. The default controls for tracing the sigils are a little frustrating, but there's an option in the settings that lets you click each point of the sigil instead of dragging the mouse from one to another.



I encountered a handful of small bugs, such as a safe where the camera zoomed out whenever I tried to enter the combination, making it impossible until I reloaded the game, but nothing that caused major problems. It also has a great visual presentation, solid voice acting, and a soundtrack that enhances the mood. There's even optional lore to research in the library alongside the required information, if you're interested in learning more about the historical and folkloric topics referenced. I enjoyed my time uncovering the secrets of Blake Manor, and overall, I found The Séance of Blake Manor to be a great game.

The Final Word
The Séance of Blake Manor is an intriguing supernatural mystery filled with interesting characters and secrets to discover. While the time management aspect might feel intimidating at first, it adds a sense of urgency and helps the player feel like a detective while offering enough freedom not to feel stifled. Overall, it's an excellent game for fans of mysteries and the supernatural.

US space agency Nasa has rejected reality star Kim Kardashian's claim that the 1969 space mission to land the first man on the Moon was faked.

""Yes, we've been to the Moon before... 6 times!"" Nasa acting administrator Sean Duffy wrote on social media.

Kardashian made the comments on the latest episode of her long-running TV series The Kardashians, telling co-star Sarah Paulson she thought the Moon landing ""didn't happen"".

Despite being consistently debunked, conspiracy theories as to whether humans actually reached the Moon have persisted for more than 50 years, particularly with the rise of social media. 

In the episode, Kardashian can be seen showing Paulson an interview with astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who along with Neil Armstrong took the first steps on the lunar surface during the Apollo 11 mission.

""I'm sending you a million articles with both Buzz Aldrin and the other one,"" Kardashian says, before reading a quote allegedly from Aldrin responding to a question about the scariest moment of the expedition.

""There was no scary moment because it didn't happen. It could've been scary, but it wasn't because it didn't happen,"" she reads.

Kardashian appears to be referring to comments made by Aldrin during a talk in the UK in 2015. During that exchange, Aldrin does not seem to suggest that the expedition did not happen, but instead that a scary moment did not happen. However, he is then prompted to recite an anecdote about a broken circuit breaker.  

In her conversation with Paulson, Kardashian is later seen telling a producer that she believes the Moon landing was fake.

""I think it was fake. I've seen a few videos on Buzz Aldrin talking about how it didn't happen,"" she says. ""He says it all the time now, in interviews. Maybe we should find Buzz Aldrin."" 

Aldrin has not yet commented on Kardashian's remarks. 

Fact-checkers, including at the Reuters news agency, have previously debunked conspiracy theories in which Aldrin's comments have been misinterpreted to suggest he has admitted the landing did not happen. 

Following the Kardashian broadcast, Duffy tagged the reality star in a post on X, rebuffing her comments, and promoted Nasa's current moon exploration program Artemis, which is ""going back under the leadership"" of Donald Trump.

""We won the last space race and we will win this one too,"" he added.

In response, Kardashian wrote back asking about the interstellar object named 3I/Atlas, which astronomers said could be the oldest comet ever seen.

""Wait…. what's the tea on 3I Atlas?!?!!!!!!!?????"" she replied.

Duffy later invited Kardashian to the Kennedy Space Center for the launch of the Artemis mission to the moon.

For  decades, scientists and experts have rebutted conspiracy theories claiming the Apollo 11 mission was a hoax.

""Every single argument claiming that Nasa faked the Moon landings has been discredited,"" according to the Institute of Physics.

It is hoped the number of employees in Scotland's space industry will rocket to 20,000 in the next 10 years. 

The rocket launched from Starbase, Texas and flew for more than an hour before splash landing into the Indian Ocean.

The Euclid satellite, launched by Space X, was developed by a team including Professor Adam Amara.

Astronauts of Nasa's first crewed mission to the Moon for more than 50 years hope their journey inspires a new generation.

The mission around the Moon will pave the way for a lunar landing as soon as 2027.

Conspiracy theories don't just invent villains; they recycle them.


	By Luis Prada

The United States is currently in the midst of a grand experiment: what happens if we give the cranks, the maniacs, the grifters, the late-night AM radio conspiracy theorist call-in people the reins of the country? What happens if we hand over the government to the tinfoil hat wearers who have spent centuries thinking the government and its various nefarious plots are behind every evil deed?

It doesn't seem to be going too well, but success or failure isn't really the point when it comes to this kind of person. The point is the perpetuation of the mystery. The conspiracy itself, the community that builds around it, is the point.

In a new essay in MIT Technology Review, author Dorian Lynskey writes about the United States as a nation that thrives on paranoia and conspiracy, and how technology has only made it easier to get lost in your own little parallel world of unreality.

Lynskey writes about a pair of mid-century scholars whose works combined to divide the roadmap for understanding modern conspiracy theory culture. Karl Popper, a Philosopher who defined the idea of a conspiracy theory as we know it today, and Richard Hofstadter, a professor of American history at Columbia University, who gave a lecture on the paranoia inherent in American politics the day before President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, kicking off one of the most enduring conspiracies in American history. 

Together, they nailed something that still defines our public life: the idea that if we just dig deep enough, we'll find the puppet master pulling every string.

The problem here, Lynskey argues, is that this idea is nothing new. It's been around for centuries. The only thing that changes is the names of the people behind it all. In the 1700s, it was the Illuminati. In the 1800s, the Jews of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. In the 1900s, the communists. In the 2000s, it was globalists, George Soros, or “The Deep State.”

Each set of villains provides the same thing: a tidy explanation for why things are a mess, and they give the paranoid someone to blame it all on. Conspiracy theories don't just invent villains; they recycle them.

Technology supercharges it all – and not just of the smartphones in our pockets. Lynskey says the printing press fueled witch hunts, and radio helped spread fascist propaganda. All smartphones and the internet have done is turn paranoia into a lifestyle brand. Algorithms run on outrage, and the people on these services demand simple, elegant answers to deeply complex problems, but don't realize that the supposedly simpler and more elegant solutions are much more complicated than anything reality has to offer.

People today can fully envelop themselves within conspiracy theories much more easily than people ever could before. You could, in no time at all, almost accidentally curate a social media feed that walls off reality and nestles you within a cozy little cocoon of conspiracy.

Hofstadter warned that the paranoid style thrives when people feel powerless. Today, we're drowning in powerlessness. NPR just ran a demoralizing story about how America's youth feel like they have no future, that the American dream is well and truly dead, and no one in charge cares enough to do anything about it.

That is probably why we are currently being run by the conspiracy theory administration. In an era where hope is dead, anyone with a social media account can rise up and provide “truths” that easily and conveniently explain who's behind the latest crisis, only for all of that to get tossed out and replaced with a whole new set of villains when the next outrage hits.

Lynskey stops short of really digging into why conspiracy theories persist, especially in this day and age when they seem more prevalent and influential than ever. I have my own theory about that.

Conspiracy theories used to exist on the political fringes, but now they are the establishment. Conspiracy theory is now policy. This is what happens when you create a large-scale societal shift in focus away from those of us who feel powerless and start catering to the powerful. In time, this shift drives a society toward trying to find a collective explanation for why the majority was abandoned.

There were no simple answers. The divide-and-conquer strategies of American politics muddied the waters. Everyone could potentially be corrupt. Everyone could potentially be a part of the problem. All the while, being ignored and being driven into isolation drove us crazy. It broke our brains. Sometimes, a large-scale societal shift in focus away from those of us who feel powerless and a catering toward the powerful can, in time, drive a society toward blaming a shadowy network of powerful figures when, really, the problem is just as simple as neglect.

We've all been there. It's after sunset and another vehicle flashes its headlights in your direction. This could mean anything from a speed trap nearby, bad road conditions ahead, or even crashed cars on the roadway ahead.

Sometimes it can be helpful, other times, downright annoying. But the question is, is flashing your headlights illegal in the state of South Dakota?

While doing a little research on the subject, the answer didn't present itself right away. After diving a little deeper, I found some information on South Dakota's section of the website, trafficschoolonline.com. This website is for anyone who moves to a new state and needs information on its driving laws, as they can differ dramatically depending on what state you live in.

According to the site, there is no specific law allowing or prohibiting headlight flashing. While this may seem like a ringing endorsement for headlight flashing, it's more likely a much more vague law in the eyes of law enforcement. If the police believe your headlight flashing is impairing other drivers (or even yourself) from your duties on the roadway, you could still be cited.

This law (or lack of law) varies from state to state. In Minnesota, it is in fact illegal to flash your high beams at another vehicle. In Iowa, it appears that there is also no law preventing you from flashing your headlights, but if your flashing is interfering with the work of law enforcement, it could be enough for them to pull you over.

In this article

Cloud computing startup Lambda announced on Monday a multibillion-dollar deal with Microsoft for artificial intelligence infrastructure powered by tens of thousands of Nvidia chips.

The agreement comes as Lambda benefits from surging consumer demand for AI-powered services, including AI chatbots and assistants, CEO Stephen Balaban told CNBC's ""Money Movers"" on Monday.

""We're in the middle of probably the largest technology buildout that we've ever seen,"" Balaban said. ""The industry is going really well right now, and there's just a lot of people who are using ChatGPT and Claude and the different AI services that are out there.""

Balaban said the partnership will continue the two companies' long-term relationship, which goes back to 2018.

A specific dollar amount was not disclosed in the deal announcement.

Founded in 2012, Lambda provides cloud services and software for training and deploying AI models, servicing over 200 thousand developers, and also rents out servers powered by Nvidia's graphics processing units.

The new infrastructure with Microsoft will include the NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, which are also deployed by hyperscaler CoreWeave, according to a release.

""We love Nvidia's product,"" Balaban said. ""They have the best accelerator product on the market.""

The company has dozens of data centers and is planning to continue not only leasing data centers but also constructing its own infrastructure as well, Balaban said.

Earlier in October, Lambda announced plans to open an AI factory in Kansas City in 2026. The site is expected to launch with 24 megawatts of capacity with the potential to scale up to over 100 MW.

            A medieval tower in the heart of Italy's capital, near the famous Roman Forum ruins, partially collapsed on Monday during renovations of the structure, critically injuring one worker and trapping another, authorities said.
    


            Hundreds of tourists watched as firefighters used a mobile ladder to bring a stretcher to the upper level of the Torre dei Conti to rescue the worker who remained trapped.
    


            During the rescue attempt, another part of the structure partially collapsed, sending up a cloud of debris and forcing firefighters to quickly retreat.
    


            Firefighter spokesman Luca Cari confirmed that the one remaining worker remained trapped hours after the initial collapse. He added that a rescued worker was being treated in critical condition and that another three workers were rescued unharmed.
    


            The initial collapse happened some time before noon, and did not appear to have involved any bystanders.
    


            Queen Paglinawan was working in a nearby gelato parlor when she heard the two loud noises from the town in quick succession.
    


            “I was working and then I heard some like falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way,” Paglinawan, 27, said as yet another collapse occurred in the background.
    


            German student Viktoria Braeu passed by the scene just as the partial collapse during the firefighters' rescue occurred.
    


            “We were just at the Colosseum … and we were just walking to get some food. … And then we were like, ‘It's probably not long until it's going to go down,' and then it just started erupting,” said Braeu, 18.

            Four firefighters later approached the first-floor window on two mobile ladders, but were quickly pulled back when dust emerged. Authorities then positioned a drone in front of the window in an apparent attempt to check the condition of the trapped worker.
    


            The Torre dei Conti was built in the 13th century by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his family. The tower was damaged in a 1349 earthquake and suffered subsequent collapses in the 17th century.
    


            Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri and Italian Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli were at the scene, but declined to speak with reporters.

Judge ‘found no credible evidence' that protests grew out of control but final ruling to come Friday

A federal judge in Oregon on Sunday barred Donald Trump's administration from deploying the national guard to Portland, Oregon, until at least Friday, saying she “found no credible evidence” that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops earlier this fall.

The city and state sued in September to block the deployment.

It's the latest development in weeks of legal back-and-forth in Portland, Chicago and other US cities as the Trump administration has moved to federalize and deploy the National Guard in city streets to quell protests.

The ruling from US district court judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city's US Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law.

In a 16-page filing late Sunday, Immergut said she would issue a final order on Friday due to the voluminous evidence presented at trial, including more than 750 exhibits.

The purpose of the deployment, according to the Trump administration, is to protect federal personnel and property where protests are occurring or likely to occur. Legal experts said that a higher appellate court order that remains in effect would have barred troops from being deployed anyway.

Immergut wrote that most violence appeared to be between protesters and counter-protesters and found no evidence of “significant damage” to the immigration facility at the center of the protests.

“Based on the trial testimony, this court finds no credible evidence that during the approximately two months before the president's federalization order, protests grew out of control or involved more than isolated and sporadic instances of violent conduct that resulted in no serious injuries to federal personnel,” she wrote.

The complex case comes as Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement – including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue – seek to push back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states' sovereignty.

The administration argues that it needs the troops because it has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces – one of the conditions set by Congress for calling up troops.

Immergut issued two orders in early October that blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. She previously found that Trump had failed to show that he met the legal requirements for mobilizing the national guard. She described his assessment of Portland, which Trump has called “war-ravaged” with “fires all over the place,” as “simply untethered to the facts”.

One of Immergut's orders was paused on 20 October by a three-judge panel of the ninth US circuit court of appeals. But late Tuesday, the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the matter before an 11-judge panel. Until the larger panel rehears the case, the appeals court's initial order from early October – under which the national guard is federalized but not deployed – remains in effect.

During the Portland trial, witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city's ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Trump's national guard announcement.

The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a “rebellion” or “danger of rebellion” – another one of the conditions for calling up troops under federal law.

Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, RC, due to safety concerns.

RC, who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland's ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter. He also said he was “surprised” to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down.

Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on 14 June, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The United States is not ready to restart nuclear weapons testing and risks losing ground to China and Russia if it pushes ahead with Donald Trump's plans, experts believe.

The president announced this week that the US would conduct tests of nuclear weapons for the first time in more than three decades, breaking one of the few remaining taboos among the superpowers.

Experts fear that in doing so, Mr Trump has fired the starting gun on a race Washington is ill-prepared to win, and that it could find itself matched or overtaken by Moscow and Beijing.

Visitors to America's vast testing site in the Nevada desert said it is filled with equipment that is slowly rusting away, while former officials say it simply has not had the investment to match the president's ambitions.

Now there are fears that Mr Trump has opened a “Pandora's Box” that has remained shut almost since the end of the Cold War. And he might not be prepared for what comes next.

The president made the announcement on Thursday via his Truth Social platform, shortly before sitting down for talks with Xi Jinping.

Some believe it was a case of nuclear sabre-rattling intended to intimidate the Chinese premier. Some think he was kicking off a nuclear arms race in earnest. And others are simply baffled by the announcement.

Since 1992, the US, China and Russia abide by a moratorium on nuclear testing, although one US official suggested several years ago that Moscow could be conducting secret experiments.

Because none of the superpowers have ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CBTB), which bans “any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion”, this is not legally binding.

The situation resembles a Mexican stand-off, but with nuclear bombs instead of guns.

Mr Trump's announcement could have been prompted by Moscow's claims to have tested nuclear-powered weapons, such as its “Poseidon” drone apparently capable of creating a radioactive tsunami, or “Skyfall” cruise missiles, said to have an effectively unlimited range.

But this is different to detonating a nuclear warhead.

Mr Trump giving the instruction to the Pentagon also rings alarm bells: the energy department has responsibility for atomic testing through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).

“The president of the United States needs to be speaking with clarity and precision and care about nuclear matters. And as we can see, this president is not,” said Daryl G Kimball, director of the Arms Control Association.

“If there's a nuclear crisis, and if Trump is communicating this way, it could lead to catastrophe.”

Corey Hinderstein, a former senior NNSA official, wants the president to urgently clarify his announcement on Thursday.

“It's one thing to fire the starting gun,” she said. “It's another thing to accidentally pull the trigger.”

Mr Trump's announcement seemingly dropped out of the sky with all the force of a 50-megaton bomb, but the idea has been floated for a while.

Officials in the president's first term reportedly considered breaking the moratorium, and Robert O'Brien, Mr Trump's former national security adviser, publicly backed that move last year as a means of “peace through strength”.Yet others believe the US has maintained its lead among global nuclear arsenals precisely because of the tests it conducted before the practice became taboo in the 1990s.

Since 1945, Washington has detonated 1,149 nuclear devices compared to Russia's 969. China, a fledgling superpower during the same period, detonated a mere 45.

Ms Hinderstein, who now works with the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace in Washington, DC, says the US has a much more sophisticated understanding of nuclear weapons because of those tests and there is no technical need for full-scale trials to ensure the reliability and safety of its existing weapons stockpile.

The information it already has from earlier trials can be used in tandem with billion-dollar supercomputers at sites which simulate nuclear tests without the need for detonations. One such site is Los Alamos in New Mexico where Robert Oppenheimer led efforts to build a nuclear bomb during the Second World War.

Ms Hinderstein said: “The United States is better-suited to do all of this without nuclear testing than any of our adversaries. Starting a testing cascade where others would follow is actually giving a cheat code to our adversaries that they don't have.”

Authorities could detonate a nuclear device underground within about 18 months if they did not have to collect any data: what one expert refers to as a “screw you nuclear test explosion”.

Mounting a proper test would take, by broad consensus, at least three years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

Miners and drillers qualified to work in a nuclear test zone would have to be hired. Equipment such as a specialised crane to lower the device dep into the ground needs to be procured. Sand and rock must be stockpiled to fill the shafts and prevent radioactive material from spreading above ground.

Staffing issues at the NNSA exacerbated by Elon Musk's Doge cuts will scarcely speed up the process, which could be further delayed if Nevada politicians mount a legal fight to stop tests going ahead.

And, on top of all of that, the test site simply is not fit for Mr Trump's purposes.

“The area where they're storing the equipment for the test readiness programme is filled with rusted cables and equipment,” recalled Mr Kimball, who visited the site two years ago.

Others told The Washington Post the equipment that would be used to excavate the site for an underground nuclear detonation was a “rust pit”.

“It doesn't look fancy and shiny,” said a former official. “The equipment would be capable, but it certainly wouldn't impress anybody with its modern characteristics.”

At the same time, satellite images appear to show that Russia and China have been upgrading their test sites at Novaya Zemlya and Lop Nur so they are ready to resume nuclear detonations.

Mr Kimball expects they would probably be able to do so more rapidly than the US “because they have fewer safety and regulatory issues to deal with”.

There is widespread bafflement about why Mr Trump should be the president to break a taboo observed by his predecessors since the days of George Bush Snr.

It's only a few months ago that he said he wanted to “denuclearise” and reduce the US stockpile of 3,800 nuclear weapons.

Some speculate that an official connected to the Heritage Foundation, a think tank that has called for the resumption of nuclear weapons tests, raised the issue with him.

Robert Peters, a research fellow with the foundation, told The Washington Post last week the US needed to “do something to demonstrate that we're not going to be intimidated or coerced by these autocrats in Beijing, Moscow and Pyongyang”.

A years-long wait for tests was “unacceptable”, he said, suggesting the president could carry out a test above ground, which has not been done since the days of John F Kennedy and has been linked to increased cancer rates.

Other experts hope the president misspoke or is indulging in characteristic brinkmanship, and that the Kremlinologists in China and Russia aren't taking him too literally.

Almost nobody knows what Mr Trump means. He may not be sure himself. Either way, a nuclear arms race might already have begun.

The move is a “perverted interpretation of a rule that stops grocers from price gouging SNAP recipients,” said a critic.

As the Trump administration continued its illegal freeze on food assistance, the US Department of Agriculture sent a warning to grocery stores not to provide discounts to the more than 42 million Americans affected.

Several grocery chains and food delivery apps have announced in recent days that they would provide substantial discounts to those whose Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits have been delayed. More than 1 in 8 Americans rely on the program, and 39% of them are children.

But on Sunday, Catherine Rampell, a reporter at the Washington Post published an email from the USDA that was sent to grocery stores around the country, telling them they were prohibited from offering special discounts to those at greater risk of food insecurity due to the cuts.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“You must offer eligible foods at the same prices and on the same terms and conditions to SNAP-EBT customers as other customers, except that sales tax cannot be charged on SNAP purchases,” the email said. “You cannot treat SNAP-EBT customers differently from any other customer. Offering discounts or services only to SNAP-eligible customers is a SNAP violation unless you have a SNAP equal treatment waiver.”

The email referred to SNAP's “Equal Treatment Rule,” which prohibits stores from discriminating against SNAP recipients by charging them higher prices or treating them more favorably than other customers by offering them specialized sales or incentives.

Rampell said she was “aware of at least two stores that had offered struggling customers a discount, then withdrew it after receiving this email.”

She added that it was “understandable why grocery stores might be scared off” because “a store caught violating the prohibition could be denied the ability to accept SNAP benefits in the future. In low-income areas where the SNAP shutdown will have the biggest impact, getting thrown off SNAP could mean a store is no longer financially viable.”

While the rule prohibits special treatment in either direction, legal analyst Jeffrey Evan Gold argues that it was a “perverted interpretation of a rule that stops grocers from price gouging SNAP recipients… charging them more when they use food stamps.”

The government also notably allows retailers to request waivers for programs that incentivize SNAP recipients to purchase healthy food.

Others pointed out that SNAP is currently not paying out to Americans because President Donald Trump is defying multiple federal court rulings issued Friday, requiring him to tap a $6 billion contingency fund to ensure benefit payments go out. Both courts, in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, have said his administration's refusal to pay out benefits is against the law.

One labor movement lawyer summed up the administration's position on social media: “Can't follow the law when a judge says fund the program, but have to follow the rules exactly when they say don't help poor people afford food.”

 In America's Tug of War With China, Oceanic Democracy Is Caught in the Middle 

 Michael Kovrig

As the strategic rivalry between China and the United States intensifies across the Indo-Pacific, the Taiwan Strait is often seen as the key flash point. Yet whether the regional balance holds or tips into conflict will also be shaped by choices made in, by, and about the Pacific Islands—the 12 sovereign states and several territories whose archipelagos stretch across the vast ocean between the Philippines and Hawaii.

Since the first decade of this century, China has steadily expanded its presence across the region. Most Pacific governments have leaned in to Beijing's offerings—seeking infrastructure and investment, as well as the leverage that Chinese ties give them with other partners. At the same time, they have worked to preserve their own autonomy and advance a “Blue Pacific” vision of a peaceful and cohesive regional order. But as China's influence deepens and the islands' democratic institutions come under growing pressure, that vision risks being eclipsed.

Under the first Trump administration and the Biden administration, the United States belatedly recognized that, left unchecked, Chinese influence could erode governance and eventually turn some island nations into client states of Beijing. Over time, it could split regional consensus, deprive Taiwan of diplomatic allies, and complicate Western deterrence in the Pacific. To counter this dynamic, both administrations began a reengagement with the region, and the Biden administration launched a government-wide Pacific Partnership Strategy and pledged $1 billion in assistance over ten years.

Since then, however, the second Trump administration has taken steps that many Pacific leaders see as disregarding their countries' interests. With the shuttering of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the islands lost USAID's regional mission in Fiji, which oversaw programs across all 12 Pacific Island countries. The administration has also frozen tens of millions of dollars in U.S. foreign aid to the region. Other Western allies in the region have tried to fill the gap—including Australia, which has reallocated $77 million to the Pacific. But that will not be enough to counterbalance Beijing.

Meanwhile, the United States has imposed across-the-board tariffs of ten to 15 percent on Pacific nations such as Fiji, Vanuatu, and Nauru. And the administration's dismissal of climate change flies in the face of the priorities of islanders, who regard it as an existential threat—particularly those in low-lying atoll countries such as Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu.

For now, the Pacific Islands have mostly sought to avoid explicit alignment with either China or the United States and its partners. At this year's Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting in September—an annual gathering of island countries and territories together with Australia and New Zealand—the host nation, Solomon Islands, broke with tradition and did not invite any nonmembers. The immediate reason was to avoid controversy over Taiwan's participation, which China opposes as part of a persistent campaign to deprive Taipei of diplomatic recognition and relevance. But a larger consideration was China's own expanding presence in the region, which has, in turn, encouraged the United States and other powers to treat the islands more as strategic assets than as sovereign partners.

In a bid to manage this trend, the forum announced new rules on island partnerships with outside powers and made a formal declaration to keep the region free from militarization and external coercion. But to make these ideals a reality, Western partners will need to do more to help the islands protect their democratic institutions and defend their sovereignty. For the United States and its allies, it will be imperative to find new ways to address the islands' priorities and concerns, even as they seek to balance China.

In the late twentieth century, Pacific Island countries and territories aligned with and relied on former colonial overlords. As they achieved independence or at least greater self-rule, they built a multilateral regional order centered on the Pacific Islands Forum, established in 1971 to coordinate policies and elevate Pacific voices. Over time, this cooperative framework helped the islands chart their own destinies, alongside broad partnerships with Western governments. After the Cold War ended, however, Western strategic interest in the islands waned: aid declined, diplomatic representation thinned, and high-level engagement became sporadic.

Against this background, most Pacific Islands have welcomed China's emergence. Beijing's ambitions in the region can be traced to the early years of the twenty-first century, with then Premier Wen Jiabao making a landmark visit to Fiji in 2006. Since then, China has shaped a Pacific strategy based on incrementally increasing its presence, influence, and pressure. President Xi Jinping personally signaled that the Pacific had become a priority with trips to Fiji in 2014 and Papua New Guinea in 2018. 

The scale of Xi's ambition was revealed four years later, when Beijing attempted to persuade ten Pacific leaders to sign on to a Chinese-led development and security framework. Although this plan failed to win consensus, China has pressed ahead with some 50 bilateral agreements that deepen climate cooperation, enhance culture and education ties, expand trade and investment, facilitate Chinese maritime mapping and seabed mining, and establish law enforcement and security cooperation.



For many of the islands, the economic benefits China brings have been immediate and often literally concrete, in the form of extensive construction projects. Beijing has sought to frame its infrastructure investments—such as the longest wharf in the South Pacific at Luganville in Vanuatu or a restored airfield in the Micronesian state of Yap—as benign and trustbuilding. But China clearly has its own economic and military agenda, as well. Assessing the Pacific as relatively weakly contested, Beijing aims to become a maritime power (haiyang qiangguo) that can control the western Pacific, marginalize regional neighbors, and prevent the United States from acting as an offshore balancer that could deter it.

To further this Pacific vision, the People's Liberation Army needs access to ports and airstrips. So far, the PLA has not sought to establish actual military bases, which would undoubtedly draw countermeasures from the United States and other Western powers. By instead building infrastructure and leasing or investing in potential dual-use logistics facilities on the islands, China can acquire the footholds it needs more quietly, often with local buy-in.

Thus far, Chinese actors have directed most attention to the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. But they are by no means neglecting others. China in this sense views the Pacific Islands as a network that can support its broader strategy across enormous ocean expanses. With time, this will enable the Chinese military, Coast Guard and research vessels to operate routinely in the central Pacific, Antarctic waters and ultimately the approaches to North and South America.

As the military scholars Andrew Erickson and Joel Wuthnow have noted, Chinese analysts have adopted the American concept of successive chains of islands (daolian) running north-south across the Pacific Ocean. As Beijing sees it, the three island chains serve as springboards for Western military deployments, benchmarks of the PLA's own force projection, and concentric Western lines of defense and containment that China must break.

Until now, most international attention has focused on the first island chain, which wraps along the coast of Asia from the Kuril Islands through Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines to Borneo. Since roughly 2012, when Xi came to power and China became increasingly assertive in the Pacific, Beijing has persistently stepped up its military presence in the Taiwan Strait and claimed maritime sovereignty over large parts of the seas within this chain—despite international rulings to the contrary.

Yet the second island chain, where many of the Pacific Islands are located, has also become a geopolitical testing ground. Running from the north Pacific through Micronesia and Melanesia, this broad arc of countries and territories is where Western interests collide with China's emerging power projection across the Pacific. South Pacific sea-lanes that link Asia with Australia pass Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, making those countries strategically significant for Australia and potential pressure points for Beijing. A third conceptual chain stretches from the Aleutian Islands through Hawaii, Kiribati's Line Islands, and French Polynesia. For now, China is not directly asserting influence there, but signs of nascent Chinese interest in atolls such as Kanton, Kiritimati, and Hao suggest longer-term ambitions.

Just as Taiwan and Hawaii are critical defensive links for the United States and its allies in the first and third chains, Guam, an unincorporated territory, is the linchpin of U.S. deterrence in the second island chain, allowing the U.S. military to respond rapidly to military contingencies in the first chain. But over the past decade, the PLA has introduced intermediate-range ballistic missiles such as the DF-26—often dubbed the “Guam killer” (Guandao shashou)—capable of striking Guam and other second-chain islands.



In September, Beijing also showcased new hypersonic missiles that Chinese media claim can “break” the island chains. In response, the U.S. military has sought to harden, disperse, and distribute its assets more widely across the region, notably by expanding airfields in the Northern Mariana Islands and Micronesia. Both developments have heightened Pacific Island concerns that they could become U.S. staging bases—and, hence, Chinese targets.

To anchor its growing influence, Beijing has tried to build formal and substantive relations with all the Pacific Islands. Since 2019, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and Nauru have switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, leaving only the Marshall Islands, Palau, and Tuvalu maintaining ties with Taipei, despite persistent Chinese pressure. For China, muscling Taiwan out of the region and embedding its own assets there is part of its larger aim to dominate the maritime approaches to the first chain, be able to deny and disrupt Western military operations and logistics between there and the second, and develop the blue-water naval capabilities to distract and divert in the third.

At the Pacific edges of what Beijing's policymakers call China's greater periphery (da zhoubian), the PLA and China Coast Guard are also rapidly increasing surveillance, intelligence gathering, and force projection—often using “gray zone” tactics. For example, Chinese research vessels have probed the waters of Micronesia and navy ships have expanded defense diplomacy. In 2024, PLA Navy destroyers visited Vanuatu and Tonga, and in a rare missile test, the PLA Rocket Force sent an intercontinental ballistic missile into the South Pacific. In February, a Chinese naval task force circumnavigated Australia and conducted live-fire exercises in the Tasman Sea. Australian analysts see these as unsubtle demonstrations of China's growing capability to coerce Canberra.

Pacific Island officials fret about a spiral of militarization, and with good reason. In a clash between China and Taiwan, for example, multiple war-gaming scenarios indicate the PLA could seek to thwart Western intervention by striking military targets, cutting undersea cables, and disrupting transportation along and between the island chains. The consequences for the Pacific Islands could be catastrophic—particularly if fighting coincided with one of the region's frequent natural disasters.

Alongside its growing military presence in the region, Beijing has sought to become a preferred provider of internal security expertise, training, and equipment. China's Ministry of Public Security now works with police in Fiji, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu; PLA defense attachés offer similar assistance to the militaries of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Tonga. The China Coast Guard's recent registration of 26 ships with the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, an intergovernmental body that promotes sustainable fishing, underscores Beijing's aim to become a leading enforcer of the high seas. Security and human rights experts worry that these activities may also provide Beijing a way to disseminate authoritarian doctrines and politicize defense and law enforcement.

In its diplomatic and economic activity, China is already rivaling the United States and slowly closing the gap with Australia. For now, Canberra still has the most officials working on Pacific countries and is their leading donor. But as part of its overall strategy to strengthen ties, China has hosted frequent state visits for Pacific leaders and gatherings of officials, offered scholarships and cultural exchanges, and deployed Chinese medical teams and a PLA hospital ship. These efforts have begun to shape Pacific perceptions.

All the Pacific Islands that have diplomatically recognized Beijing have also joined its Belt and Road Initiative, including most recently the Cook Islands, which signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement in February, rattling officials in New Zealand, its constitutional partner and strategic guarantor. These accords are weaving a new web of economic and political relationships and jolting traditional Western partners to shore up their own influence. Australia has responded with a slew of its own initiatives, including a landmark mutual defense treaty with Papua New Guinea signed in October. Australia's foreign minister, Penny Wong, says her country is in a permanent contest.



Trade, financing, and development assistance now link most Pacific Islands to China. Some countries, such as Tonga, have become increasingly dependent on Chinese credit. Chinese engineering companies dominate construction sectors, and other Chinese enterprises have become key players in Pacific economies. Although some islanders and observers criticize Chinese loans and projects as unsuitable, unsustainable, or coming with hidden strings attached, the general view from most of these countries is that China delivers—typically more quickly and with less red tape than Western competitors.

Yet these deals and projects often involve extensive corruption. In island after island, politicians, civil society representatives, journalists, and analysts allege that Chinese interests have used bribery and other unethical incentives. They report such methods as coercion, election interference, media manipulation, and use of proxies who are linked to organized crime networks or the Chinese Communist Party's United Front, an international network of the party that operates globally to capture foreign elites and shape narratives about China abroad. Although few cases have been proved in court, surveys indicate that many islanders believe corruption is widespread and safeguards are inadequate.

Regional analysts also warn that China has been targeting island elites with lavish financial and political rewards for supporting its strategic preferences. This has already been reflected in the shifting voting patterns of the 12 Pacific Island countries at the UN General Assembly: in 2000, on resolutions where China and the United States disagreed, Pacific votes aligned with China's just 54 percent of the time. By 2024, that alignment had risen to 86 percent. To be fair, such support for China is at least partly motivated by frustration with Western partners for failing to deliver on climate financing and critical infrastructure. But it suggests how quickly China has gained sway.

By now, many Pacific leaders understand what is at stake in China's bid to bring the region into its orbit. Despite its tangible benefits, engagement with Beijing is posing new threats to governance, political stability, environmental sustainability, national security, regional consensus—and potentially self-determination. The Pacific norms and institutions that hold elites accountable, ensure rule of law, and sustain independent news reporting all show signs of strain. The sheer disparity in scale with Beijing that the islands face—China's population is 1.4 billion compared with their combined 14 million—imposes an extreme imbalance of power.

Pacific peoples insist that their islands are not just links in strategic chains and are making clear that they form a unique, self-governing community with a right to define its own vision and destiny. They have been asserting their priorities, such as dealing with climate change, promoting sustainable development, and addressing nontraditional security threats, through such initiatives as the Pacific Islands Forum's Boe Declaration on Regional Security, the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, and now the Ocean of Peace Declaration, which the forum adopted in September.

Yet in the face of China's ever-expanding influence, Pacific-led efforts will only succeed with steadfast support. One positive step would be for the U.S. Congress to adopt the Pacific Partnership Act, legislation that would mandate the administration to put forth a formal Pacific Islands strategy, which would likely facilitate increased and more predictable U.S. financing, deeper cooperation on maritime and security challenges, and better coordination with other partners. Following through on such a strategy would be a powerful signal of U.S. commitment to the region.

The United States can build a better model of engagement that recognizes the islands' own interests even as it enhances U.S. national security. American and Pacific Island interests are already aligned in seeking to deter aggression and coercion in the Pacific. But to sustain that deterrent capacity, the United States and its partners must recognize the political, economic, environmental, and social concerns of the islands themselves. Supporting the islands' sovereignty and democratic institutions, and sincerely addressing their interests, is not only good for Pacific peoples. It is also a cost-effective way for Washington and its allies to preserve the fragile balance that keeps the Pacific as peaceful as its name.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Netanyahu speaks out on Israel's ‘most serious PR attack'","https://www.rt.com/news/627279-netanyahu-idf-palestinian-detainee-abuse/","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 12:35:00 GMT","

The leak of a video allegedly showing Israeli soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian prisoner is the “most serious public relations attack against Israel,” Benjamin Netanyahu has said.

The footage, filmed at the Sde Teiman base near the Gaza border, showed soldiers leading a blindfolded detainee away and surrounding him with riot shields as they allegedly carried out the abuse. Leaked to Israel's Channel 12, it aired in August 2024 and caused an uproar.

The detainee was later treated for a ruptured bowel, severe anal and lung injuries, and broken ribs. Five reservists were initially probed for rape, but their charges were later downgraded to “severe abuse,” according to a February indictment. All denied the charges, and the trial is ongoing.

The scandal reignited on Friday after the Israel Defense Force's (IDF) top military lawyer, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, admitted that she had approved the video's release and resigned from her post.

At a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu decried the scandal, saying the leak “caused enormous reputational damage to Israel, to the IDF, and to our soldiers.”

“It is perhaps the most serious public relations attack Israel has experienced since its founding – I cannot recall one so concentrated and intense,” Netanyahu said, as cited by The Times of Israel, and called for “an independent and impartial inquiry.”

The leak followed the arrest of the reservists accused of abuse, which sparked right-wing riots demanding their release. In her resignation letter, Tomer-Yerushalmi said she leaked the video amid pressure to halt the investigation into the incident, insisting her duty was to act on “reasonable suspicion of violence against a detainee.”

Multiple right-wing politicians, including Defense Minister Israel Katz, have since claimed the release of the footage from security cameras amounted to a “blood libel” against falsely accused soldiers, despite their indictments. Last week, a criminal investigation was launched into the leak.

The case drew sharp criticism from a UN commission investigating Israel's treatment of Palestinians, which said it “represented the tip of the iceberg.” It noted that detainees at Sde Teiman and other Israeli detention sites were routinely shackled, beaten, and subjected to acts of sexual nature. These and other findings earlier this year prompted the UN to accuse Israel of genocide against Palestinians.

King Charles stripped his brother of his titles over relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, a former friend of Trump's

Donald Trump has said he feels “very badly” for the British royal family after King Charles stripped his brother, Andrew, of his titles over the former prince's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the late, convicted sex offender.

The ex-Duke of York, now known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, will also have to move out of his long-term residence at the Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate, Buckingham Palace announced on Thursday.

The decision follows anxiety within the royal household about the damage caused by continual headlines concerning Mountbatten Windsor's friendship with the paedophile financier. The former prince has also faced allegations of sexual assault against him by one of Epstein's victims, Virginia Giuffre.

Speaking to reporters onboard Air Force One on Sunday evening, Trump – who was friends with Epstein before winning his two US presidencies – was asked about King Charles's decision to strip Andrew of his peerages and titles.

“I feel very badly,” Trump said. “It's a terrible thing that's happened to the family. That's been a tragic situation. It's too bad. I feel badly for the family.”

Trump has frequently spoken of his admiration for Britain's royal family, including during his unprecedented second state visit to the UK in September. He hailed the so-called special relationship between the US and Britain as he paid a gushing tribute to King Charles.

But Trump has faced his own political woes in recent months over his own alleged relationship with Epstein, who was found dead in a New York jail cell in 2019. Before Trump was greeted by King Charles during September's visit, several images of the US president and Epstein were projected on to Windsor Castle, with an accompanying soundtrack questioning their relationship.

Meanwhile, Mountbatten Windsor has been under renewed scrutiny over his ties to Epstein after the publication of newly released emails and a posthumous memoir by Giuffre, who died by suicide in April at the age of 41. In the book, she claimed she was forced to have sex with the former prince on three occasions, including when she was 17 and also during an orgy after being trafficked by Epstein. She claimed Mountbatten Windsor “believed that having sex with me was his birthright”.

Mountbatten Windsor, 65, has always denied claims he had sex with Giuffre when she was 17. He settled a civil case with her for a reported £12m ($16m) with no admission of liability.

In the latest fallout from the scandal, the UK defence secretary, John Healey, said on Sunday that Mountbatten Windsor would be stripped of his last remaining naval title, which he was given in 2015.

He was stripped of his other honorary military titles by his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, in 2022 after he was sued by Giuffre.

On Friday, a Democratic congressman called for Mountbatten Windsor to testify before the US House of Representatives committee that is conducting an inquiry into the government's handling of the Epstein case.

Firefighters worked to rescue a worker trapped for hours beneath the rubble of a medieval tower that partly collapsed while under renovation in the heart of Italy's capital on Monday, critically injuring another worker.

Firefighters faced a complex task as the structure continued to give way as they tried to get near the trapped worker through a first-floor window, forcing their retreat on telescopic aerial ladders in a cloud of smoke. Another approach on two ladders was also aborted, and a drone sent up in their stead.

As dusk approached, firefighters lifted on a crane used giant tubes to suck rubble out of the second-floor window.

Three workers were rescued unharmed after the initial midday collapse, said firefighter spokesperson Luca Cari. Italian media reported that another worker, age 64, was hospitalized in critical condition but there was no immediate update on his condition. No firefighters were injured in the ongoing operation.

Rome's top law enforcement official, Prefect Lamberto Giannini, said there were “signs of life” from the trapped worker, and that firefighters had managed to give him some protective cover during an earlier rescue attempt.

Giannini called the situation “very complex” and said that other equipment was being brought in.

“It will be a very long operation. We must try to save this person while mitigating the enormous risks to the people who are trying to save him,'' Giannini told reporters.

Hundreds of tourists had assembled to watch as firefighters used a mobile ladder to bring a stretcher to the upper level of the Torre dei Conti during the first rescue attempt. Suddenly, another part of the structure partially collapsed, sending up a cloud of debris and forcing firefighters to quickly descend on the ladder.

Queen Paglinawan was working in a nearby gelato parlor when she heard the two loud noises from the town in quick succession.

“I was working and then I heard something falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way,'' Paglinawan, 27, said as yet another collapse occurred in the background.

German student Viktoria Braeu passed by the scene just as the partial collapse during the firefighters' rescue occurred.

“We were just at the Colosseum … and we were just walking to get some food. … And then we were like, ‘It's probably not long until it's going to go down,' and then it just started erupting,'' said Braeu, 18.

The Torre dei Conti was built in the 13th century by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his family. The tower was damaged in a 1349 earthquake and suffered subsequent collapses in the 17th century.

Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri and Italian Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli were at the scene, but did not speak to reporters.

“The firefighters risked their lives with the second collapse. We are worried for the worker who remains trapped,'' said Federico Mollicone, chairman of the parliamentary culture committee.

Trump has baselessly asserted that other countries are testing weapons —  a claim contradicted by monitoring groups.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

This past week, President Donald Trump called on the Department of Defense (DOD) to restart nuclear weapons testing “immediately,” citing false claims about other countries' nuclear arsenals and testing.

In a Truth Social post on Wednesday and an interview that aired on Sunday, Trump was vague regarding the extent of the future nuclear weapons testing, including whether he would push for actual nuclear explosions. 

Trump claimed in his social media post that the U.S. has the most nuclear weapons out of every country in the world, followed by Russia and China. This is false — Russia actually has the most nuclear weapons. Trump also claimed that China would reach parity with the U.S. “within 5 years,” although nuclear arms experts doubt that China will come anywhere close to possessing the amount of nuclear weapons the U.S. has within the next few years.

“Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War [sic] to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,” Trump wrote. “That process will begin immediately.”

Despite Trump's suggestion that other countries are testing nuclear weapons, only one country, North Korea, has even tested such weapons in the 21st century. Indeed, most countries ended their nuclear weapons testing in the 1990s. (The U.S. suspended tests in 1992.)

Trump repeated these falsehoods in a “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday evening. 

“We're the only country that doesn't test,” Trump said. 

O'DONNELL: Why do we need to test our nuclear weapons?TRUMP: Well, because you have to see how they work

When host Norah O'Donnell attempted to correct him, Trump rejected the idea that he could be wrong, asserting that China and Russia both conduct nuclear weapons tests — despite the fact that international monitoring organizations would be aware of such tests and alert the public if they were taking place.

O'Donnell suggested to Trump that he could be referring to a missile test that Russia conducted last week, which did not include an actual nuclear weapon but could potentially carry such an arsenal.

“My understanding is what Russia did recently was test the delivery systems for nuclear weapons, essentially missiles,” O'Donnell told Trump.

But the president continued to insist that other countries were doing broader tests of nuclear weapons.

“Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,” he said. 

Political observers have noted that this isn't the first time Trump has struggled to accurately convey crucial details about nuclear weapons  — indeed, during the 2016 presidential campaign, he appeared to have no idea what the nuclear triad was. 

Any mention of nuclear weapons by leaders of the nine countries that have them — including the possibility of resuming testing — is closely watched, and could be followed by action from the remaining eight countries to increase production or ready their own military capabilities.

Earlier on Sunday, Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright sought to assure Americans that Trump had not yet planned for nuclear weapons testing that would include explosions. However, even Wright's comments were not definitive.

“I think the tests we're talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said in a Fox News interview. 

Notably, Project 2025 (the policy blueprint for the Trump administration developed by the Heritage Foundation during last year's presidential election) includes sections that discuss nuclear testing. For example, the document calls on Trump to reject the international Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. It also encourages the Trump White House to “move to immediate test readiness” when it comes to the country's nuclear arsenal. 

The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) recognized in a recent press release that Trump's statements on restarting nuclear weapons testing are “not clear” regarding whether he would pursue nuclear-explosive testing, but noted that many of the president's allies have suggested he should do so. 

The announcement from Trump last week is “a wake-up call that the threat of nuclear war is real and accelerating,” CND said, adding:

If the U.S. re-starts testing its nuclear weapons, this will accelerate a new nuclear arms race, as other nuclear weapons states do the same. With heightened tensions over Ukraine, it will further escalate this terrible conflict. It will also increase tensions with China.

“CND calls for more global pressure to create diplomatic space for new treaties to be established, to push for nuclear weapons states to abide by nuclear disarmament obligations under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and for the ratification of the CTBT by all the nuclear weapons states,” the organization continued.

The first phase of the ceasefire agreement, signed by Hamas and Israel in early October after weeks of intense negotiations mediated by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States in Sharm El-Sheikh, resulted in the withdrawal of Israeli forces to what officials referred to as the “Yellow Line.” This initial pullback included areas of Gaza City that the Israeli army had occupied during its military operation called Chariots of Gideon 2, launched in August 2025. But for those of us whose homes sit perilously close to the “Yellow Line,” our neighborhoods have remained a war zone.

The areas Israel has withdrawn from included Al-Jalaa Street and Universities Street in western Gaza City; the Tel al-Hawa and Al-Zaytoun neighborhoods in the southern part of the city; the Sheikh Radwan pond area in the north and Al-Rashid Street in the west; as well as the Abu Hamid area and Bani Suhaila roundabout in the center of the city. In addition, Israeli forces withdrew from central Khan Yunis and some parts of the eastern areas after five months of full occupation.

However, according to the withdrawal maps, Israeli forces still control 58 percent of the Gaza Strip, labeling these regions as “areas within the Yellow Line.” This includes Rafah; parts of the Al-Zaytoun, Al-Shujaiya, and Tuffah neighborhoods in eastern Gaza City; Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun in the northern governorate; and certain areas in eastern Khan Yunis.

According to the withdrawal maps, Israeli forces still control 58 percent of the Gaza Strip.

Unlike many evacuees who were permitted to return, residents of those regions were barred from going back to their homes. Israeli War Minister Israel Katz announced that the army would place clear markings along the “Yellow Line” in the Gaza Strip as a warning to both “Hamas terrorists and Gaza residents that any violation and attempt to cross the line will be met with fire.”

The Israeli forces even impose fire control over areas beyond the “Yellow Line,” which they describe as adjacent to it. According to the withdrawal maps, the area where my destroyed home once stood — in the Al-Zaytoun neighborhood — lies approximately 300 meters away from the Yellow Line. A group of residents from my neighborhood decided to go there and set up their tents, but Israeli forces stationed nearby opened direct fire on them, even though the area is located outside the Yellow Line.

“I went with my brothers to check on the remains of our home, which I hadn't been allowed to reach for six months because Israeli forces were there,” my neighbor, Ahmed Matar, 36, said. “For a moment, I thought our area was safe since it lies outside the Yellow Line, but as soon as we arrived, a quadcopter began firing and dropping bombs randomly, and artillery shelling intensified. We survived only by a miracle.”

The issue of the Yellow Line and the occupied areas has spoiled the joy of many Gazans who had eagerly awaited the ceasefire, hoping to return to their neighborhoods — even though they are fully aware that everything there has been completely destroyed. They have had enough of living in exile, far from the places where they were born and raised, confined to overcrowded camps that lack the basic necessities of life and privacy. They dreamed of rebuilding their lives once more in their own neighborhoods — to breathe its air, to touch its soil, to pitch their tents over the rubble of their destroyed homes — but all these dreams were shattered.

“No place can ever replace the one where you were born … Every day, I dream of the moment I can return.”

Gazans affected by this situation are living every single day in fear of never being able to return to their lands. Our worst fear is that the “Yellow Line” might ultimately become a new border for Israel. According to the Trump administration's plan, the second phase of the ceasefire would later include a withdrawal from the remaining areas up to the buffer zone along the Strip, which constitutes about 16 percent of the Gaza Strip. However, as of now, negotiations regarding the second phase have not yet begun, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is using the fact that Hamas has been unable to recover and hand over the final hostages' bodies from under the rubble as a pretext to delay the negotiation process and to maintain Israel's control over those areas, leaving more than 2 million Gazans living on only half of the Strip's total area.

“I was forced to leave my home in the early days of the war, as the Israeli army classified it as a dangerous war zone,” Fadila Abu Raida, 23, told me. “For two years, we lived in a small tent that my father set up on Al-Mawasi Beach. I feel like a stranger there; I still haven't gotten used to life away from my neighborhood.”

Abu Raida, a resident of Gaza who has not been allowed to return to her neighborhood of Khuzaa in eastern Khan Yunis, added: “No place can ever replace the one where you were born — even the air in your homeland feels different from anywhere else. Every day, I dream of the moment I can return. I am truly exhausted from living this humiliating life. For me, and for thousands of Gazans, the war hasn't ended; it will only truly end when we can return to our lands.”

            Four suspects in custody in relation to their alleged involvement in the spectacular heist at the Louvre museum last month are local petty criminals with no association with organized crime, according to investigators.
    


            Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the quartet, comprising three men and one woman, were living in or around Seine-Saint-Denis, a suburb to the north of the French capital.
    


            One of the men is a 37-year-old with 11 previous convictions, 10 of which were for robbery, Beccuau said in an interview on the FranceInfo radio station Sunday.
    


            The man has “a varied criminal record but not one which would normally suggest involvement with organized crime,” she said.
    


            Another of the suspects has 15 previous convictions, two of which are for robberies, Beccuau added.
    


            The two men were also convicted over their involvement in the same robbery in Paris in 2015, she said.
    


            One of the men is in a long-term relationship with the 38-year-old woman who has been detained.
    


            “They are clearly local people,” said Beccuau.
    

Five further suspects were arrested as part of French authorities investigation into the infamous Louvre heist. Two suspects arrested last week were also placed under formal investigation on Wednesday. CNN's Melissa Bell has the latest from right outside the scene of the crime in Paris.

            Asked whether she found the profile of the suspects unusual, Beccuau replied: “I don't find it that surprising. What we are seeing now is that people with no significant association with organized crime are progressing relatively quickly to committing extremely serious crimes.”
    


            The thieves raided the Apollo Gallery on the Louvre's upper floor, which houses the French crown jewels, on October 19.
    


            They used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the museum, through a window.
    


            They broke into two high-security display cases and made off with nine items, including a diamond and sapphire jewelry set worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.

ROME (AP) — Firefighters worked to rescue a worker trapped for hours beneath the rubble of a medieval tower that partially collapsed while under renovation in the heart of Italy's capital on Monday, critically injuring another worker.

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A federal judge in Oregon on Sunday barred President Donald Trump's administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon until at least Friday, saying she “found no credible evidence” that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops earlier this fall. 

The city and state sued in September to block the deployment.

It's the latest development in weeks of legal back-and-forth in Portland, Chicago and other U.S. cities as the Trump administration has moved to federalize and deploy the National Guard in city streets to quell protests.

The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law. 

In a 16-page filing late Sunday, Immergut said she would issue a final order on Friday due to the voluminous evidence presented at trial, including more than 750 exhibits. 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




The purpose of the deployment, according to the Trump administration, is to protect federal personnel and property where protests are occurring or likely to occur. Legal experts said that a higher appellate court order that remains in effect would have barred troops from being deployed anyway.

Immergut wrote that most violence appeared to be between protesters and counter-protesters and found no evidence of “significant damage” to the immigration facility at the center of the protests.

“Based on the trial testimony, this Court finds no credible evidence that during the approximately two months before the President's federalization order, protests grew out of control or involved more than isolated and sporadic instances of violent conduct that resulted in no serious injuries to federal personnel,” she wrote. 

The complex case comes as Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue — seek to push back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states' sovereignty. The administration argues that it needs the troops because it has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces — one of the conditions set by Congress for calling up troops.

Immergut issued two orders in early October that blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. She previously found that Trump had failed to show that he met the legal requirements for mobilizing the National Guard. She described his assessment of Portland, which Trump has called “war-ravaged” with “fires all over the place,” as “simply untethered to the facts.”

One of Immergut's orders was paused Oct. 20 by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But late Tuesday, the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the matter before an 11-judge panel. Until the larger panel rehears the case, the appeals court's initial order from early October — under which the National Guard is federalized but not deployed — remains in effect.

During the Portland trial, witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city's ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Trump's National Guard announcement.

The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a “rebellion” or “danger of rebellion” — another one of the conditions for calling up troops under federal law.

Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., due to safety concerns.

R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland's ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter. He also said he was “surprised” to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down.

Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified.

Another Federal Protective Service official whom the judge also allowed to testify under his initials said protesters have at times been violent, damaged the facility and acted aggressively toward officers working at the building.

The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer due to property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions.

Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Scott Kennedy said that “without minimizing or condoning offensive expressions” or certain instances of criminal conduct, “none of these incidents suggest ... that there's a rebellion or an inability to execute the laws.”

President Donald Trump issued scads of Truth Social posts on Sunday backing politicians for re-election, including GOP Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and a slew of House Republicans.

""Sarah Huckabee Sanders has my Complete and Total Endorsement for Re-Election — SHE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!"" the president exclaimed in one post. 

Sanders, who served as Trump's White House press secretary during a portion of his first term, is the daughter of U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor.

Fox News Digital spoke with Sandra Awodele, the creator behind COI Traveler, about what Americans should be wary of ahead of their summer travels to Mexico.

The U.S. State Department has issued an increased travel advisory pertaining to Tanzania, adding an ""unrest"" risk indicator. 

The Level 2 advisory was increased to Level 3 on Oct. 31, following the presidential, Parliament and council elections there.

""Reconsider travel to Tanzania due to unrest, crime, terrorism and targeting of gay and lesbian individuals,"" the advisory says. ""Some areas [carry] increased risk.""

URGENT ADVISORY FOR EXOTIC DESTINATION WARNS OF ‘CRIMINAL GANGS' AND ‘VIOLENT CRIME' 

The State Department has warned that demonstrations can be unpredictable, and the Tanzanian government has increased security presence around protests.

""Members of the gay and lesbian community have been arrested, targeted and harassed. People who identify as gay or lesbian may experience a higher likelihood of being targeted by police,"" the advisory says.

The advisory adds, ""People detained under suspicion of same-sex sexual conduct may face invasive physical exams.""

Violent crime is also listed as common; the advisory mentioned the risk of robberies, assault and sexual assault.

The effect on food and welfare support to the poor in the government shutdown has revealed that the noncitizen and illegal immigrant community has been benefiting from the taxpayer-funded programs more than American citizens — by far.

According to newly analyzed Census Bureau data, nearly half of the immigrant community taps into the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which was suspended in some states due to the shutdown.

An analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies shared with Secrets Monday found that 47% of noncitizen households with children under 6 use the programs. For comparison, 31% of American citizen households use SNAP and WIC.

What's more, added the center, “non-citizen households account for nearly one in five of all households with young children receiving WIC or SNAP.”

It is the latest evidence that the nation's estimated 14 million illegal immigrants are costly to the country and not just because of border control expenses. Once in the country, the costs of feeding, clothing, housing, and educating the migrants add up fast.

“The results also are a reminder that once low-income immigrants settle in the country, it is very difficult to prevent their use of the welfare system,” said the center's report.

“This situation,” added the report, “raises important policy questions, including whether it makes sense to have an immigration system that allows in so many people who turn to taxpayers to support their children?”

The analysis did not suggest that fraud was at work. WIC, for example, is available to illegal immigrants while SNAP, or welfare, typically isn't.

But the center's report highlighted that most of the children in the households included in the census data are American via birthright citizenship, which the Trump administration would like to end. Those children are eligible for both programs.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Julie Lennox's fascination with tiny homes began after she tore her ACL downhill skiing in 2019.

During her long recovery from knee surgery, she spent many hours rehabbing on a stationary bike while watching a YouTube series called ""Living Big in a Tiny House."" Lennox, 59, was captivated by the tours of postage-stamp-sized homes, and by how creative and cost-effective the lifestyle seemed.

""It made me a little bit obsessed with tiny homes,"" she said. ""It just seemed like a cool way to have a smaller footprint in the world.""

But she didn't think seriously about shrinking her own footprint until 2021, when she and her former partner split up and sold their three-bedroom house in Missoula, Montana.

A surge in demand for housing across the Mountain West had sent home values skyrocketing in Missoula, and Lennox couldn't afford much on the market. So she moved in with her parents on their 15-acre property just outside the city and began planning to build her own tiny home in their backyard.

Lennox, the head of a local private school in Missoula, eventually settled on a prefabricated mobile tiny home built and delivered to her by a Canadian company, Teacup Tiny Homes, in 2022. Unlike a regular tiny home, the structure was built on a trailer chassis and sits permanently on wheels, so it can be towed and relocated to a different piece of land if needed.

The tiny home on wheels, also known as a THOW, has allowed Lennox to significantly reduce her housing costs over the last three years. It's also enabled her to live next door to her parents, whom she cooks dinner for almost every night, while giving her the flexibility to move the home if she ever wants to. She's among a growing number of Americans, including older people who are downsizing, who are choosing this alternative form of housing.

Perhaps the biggest upside of the move has been the cost savings.

Lennox spent 191,000 Canadian dollars, which was about $146,000 at the time, buying the home. She estimates she spent another $15,000 installing a pad for the structure to sit on, building a porch around it, and hooking it up to water, sewer, and electricity. She didn't take out a mortgage; she used the cash from her home sale to cover all of her costs.

These days, her housing costs are limited to utilities and home repairs, the latter of which she estimates she's spent less than $500 on over the last three years.

Because the home is so small, Lennox said she spends only about $600 a year on propane, which she uses for cooking, to heat her home and water, and to power her dryer. She hooked her home up to her parents' electricity, which powers the pump for her well water and keeps the lights on. While her parents cover the electricity bill, Lennox said her costs are quite low. In exchange, Lennox pays the Starlink Internet bill for her parents, her sister, and herself, which is $100 a month.

This brings her average monthly housing costs to less than $200.

But there's been a learning curve associated with tiny living. She's had to adjust to removing and refilling her propane tank regularly — every five or six weeks in the winter — and making sure to leave her taps dripping in the winter to prevent her pipes from freezing.

And her move required a fair amount of downsizing. But Lennox says that, these days, she doesn't miss any of her old stuff. And she's able to store some large things, like her skis and bicycles, in her parents' garage.

She shares her home with her dog, Rizzo, a 10-year-old labradoodle. It's just enough space for the two of them.

""I think if it were more than one person, that would feel a little more challenging,"" she said.

The quarters also feel a bit more cramped when it's cold out. ""The winters can be a little bit harder because it is such a small space, and so I feel a little more closed in,"" Lennox said.

Her living space is larger in the warmer months, as she spends much of her time outside on her porch, surrounded by Ponderosa pines and Douglas-fir trees, with a view of the Blackfoot River.

""Sometimes I feel more like I'm camping than I am living in my house,"" she said.

New York Attorney General Letitia James and more than a dozen other state attorneys general on Monday sued the Trump administration over its new rule limiting eligibility for a popular student loan forgiveness program.

The AGs' lawsuit, filed in Boston federal court, was prompted by the U.S. Department of Education's final rule released last week. The rule changes the definition of a ""qualifying employer"" under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to exclude certain organizations ""that engage in unlawful activities"" such as ""supporting terrorism and aiding and abetting illegal immigration,"" according to an Education Department statement.

PSLF, signed into law in 2007 by George W. Bush, offers debt cancellation after a decade to borrowers who work for non-profits and the government.

""Public Service Loan Forgiveness was created as a promise to teachers, nurses, firefighters, and social workers that their service to our communities would be honored,"" said Attorney General James in a statement.

""Instead, this administration has created a political loyalty test disguised as a regulation,"" James said.

In an email to CNBC, Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent called the rule ""commonsense reform.""

More than 40 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. Over 9 million borrowers may be eligible for PSLF, according to a 2022 estimate from Protect Borrowers, a nonprofit focused on student loans.

President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness efforts, which included making it easier to qualify for PSLF. Under President Joe Biden, more than 1 million people had their debts cleared under the program, according to a 2024 White House fact sheet.

The lawsuit was brought by attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

A coalition of cities across the U.S, labor unions and nonprofit organizations also filed a lawsuit on Monday against the Trump administration over its PSLF rule.

""The Trump Administration's illegal actions threaten to make higher education even more expensive for Boston's teachers, first responders, and civil servants,"" said Boston Mayor Michelle Wu in a statement.

President Donald Trump, who recently suggested he would be at the Supreme Court on Wednesday for oral arguments in the case that will determine the fate of many of his wide-ranging tariffs, now says he will not attend.

""I will not be going to the Court on Wednesday in that I do not want to distract from the importance of this Decision,"" Trump wrote Sunday in a Truth Social post.

""It will be, in my opinion, one of the most important and consequential Decisions ever made by the United States Supreme Court,"" he wrote.

Trump said on Oct. 15 that if he loses the case, ""we will be a weakened, troubled, financial mess for many, many years to come.

""That's why I think I'm going to go to the Supreme Court to watch,"" Trump said at the time.

If he had gone, Trump likely would have been the first sitting U.S. president to attend oral arguments at the Supreme Court.

The Justice Department is asking the Supreme Court to reverse lower federal court rulings in two separate cases that found that Trump did not have the legal authority to impose so-called reciprocal tariffs on April 2 on imported goods from nearly every country in the world.

The tariffs range from a baseline of 10% on many countries to as high as 50% on imported goods from Brazil and India.

Also at stake in the case is the legality of separate ""fentanyl tariffs"" that Trump slapped on some imports from China, Canada and Mexico. Trump said the tariffs on those countries were for not stopping the flow of that deadly drug into the United States.

Trump had invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the tariffs.

On Sunday, Trump wrote, ""If a President is not allowed to use Tariffs, we will be at a major disadvantage against all other Countries throughout the World, especially the 'Majors.' ""

""In a true sense, we would be defenseless,"" he said.

In this article

Tesla has been ordered to provide records to U.S. federal auto safety regulators to comply with a sweeping investigation into possible safety defects with the company's flush-mounted, retractable door handles that can lead to people getting trapped.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a letter to Elon Musk's automaker that the agency continued to receive complaints from Tesla owners after the regulators initiated a probe in September.

Owners said they were unable to enter or exit their cars due to battery power loss and other situations impeding normal use of the doorhandles.

In some cases, owners' children were trapped inside hot vehicles, requiring first responder interventions or breaking windows to open the doors.

NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigations said they had ""received 16 reports of exterior door handles becoming inoperative due to low 12VDC battery voltage in certain MY 2021 Tesla Model Y vehicles,"" as of October 27, 2025.

The agency began the electronic door handles investigation into Tesla following a Bloomberg report bringing incidents to light. The news agency reported that people were injured or died after becoming trapped in Tesla vehicles after collisions or battery power losses that prevented doors from opening normally.

Tesla design leader Franz Von Holzhausen has said in subsequent press interviews that the company would change the design of its door handles.

Tesla competitors, including Rivian, are also reconsidering flush-mounted, or retractable door handle designs.

Volkswagen CEO Thomas Schäfer recently said his company's customers don't even want the flush-mounted, electronic doorhandles and VW has no plans to adopt them.

Meanwhile, China is expected to implement new vehicle safety standards around door handles, including a requirement to have more clearly marked, accessible and easier-to-use emergency, interior door release mechanisms.

China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has released draft standards and comments are open through November 22.

The NHTSA Tesla probe seeks records concerning all model year, ""2021 Tesla Model Y vehicles manufactured for sale or lease in the United States,"" as well as ""peer vehicles,"" including Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles from model years 2017 to 2022, and ""systems related to opening doors including, door handles, door latches, 12VDC batteries, software,"" and other components.

Tesla has until Dec. 10 to provide the records.

While Tesla can seek an extension on the deadline from NHTSA, it may face fines of ""$27,874 per violation per day, with a maximum of $139,356,994"" if the company either fails to or refuses to ""respond completely, accurately, or in a timely manner"" to NHTSA's information requests, the agency cautioned in its letter.

Oops, something went wrong

IREN

Shares of IREN surged to a record high Monday after the Australian Bitcoin miner and data center company said it inked a $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft.

IREN is also spending $5.8 billion to purchase Nvidia chips from Dell Technologies.

IREN (IREN) shares jumped to an all-time high Monday after the Australian Bitcoin miner and data center company said it inked a $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft (MSFT).

Shares of IREN were up over 8% near $66 in recent trading after reaching an intraday high of $75.73 earlier in the session. Shares of Microsoft were little changed.

The company said the deal would give Microsoft access to Nvidia (NVDA) chips in its data centers over five years. IREN also said it struck a deal to purchase related Nvidia chips and ancillary equipment from Dell Technologies (DELL) for about $5.8 billion.

IREN said it plans to pay for all the capital expenditures involved by “a combination of existing cash, customer prepayments, operating cashflows and additional financing initiatives.”

IREN, like some other Bitcoin miners, has pivoted to focus more of its business on providing AI infrastructure to capitalize on the boom in demand for computing.

Co-founder and CEO Daniel Roberts said that the Microsoft agreement represents “another major step forward for IREN as we continue to expand large-scale GPU deployments across our 3GW secured power portfolio in North America.”

With Monday's gains, IREN shares are up close to 600% for 2025.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), the Ethereum-centric treasury firm led by Fundstrat's Thomas Lee, bought 82,353 ether ETH$3,722.54 through last week, worth roughly $306 million at early Monday prices, lifting its total holdings to 3.4 million tokens, the company reported on Monday.

BMNR is lower by 5.7% in early Monday trading alongside a sizable late weekend and Monday drop in the crypto prices, with ETH lower by 3.5% over the past 24 hours to $3,715.

The company said it also boosted its unencumbered cash holdings to $389 million, up from $305 million a week ago. The combined value of BitMine's crypto, cash and equity stakes now totals $13.7 billion, according to the press release, including a $62 million position in Eightco Holdings and a 192 bitcoin in total.

The move brings BitMine's share of the ETH supply to 2.8%, worth roughly $13.3 billion at current prices as part of a long-term strategy to acquire 5% of the token's supply. 

""We're now more than halfway to our goal,"" said Lee in a statement.

The acquisition happened while many digital asset treasuries saw their share prices plummet over the past few months, struggling to raise cash and pursue their mandate to accumulate cryptocurrencies. Some entities, such as ETHZilla and Brazil's OranjeBTC, pivoted to buy back shares as their stock price fell below the net asset value of their underlying holdings.

First report from OMFIF's Public Blockchain Working Group


While the financial world is eager to embrace the promise of public blockchain technology, some in the regulatory community believe that it represents unique risks. They are responding by putting in place rules that limit the adoption of public blockchain, particularly at commercial banks.

This stance is far from universal: US regulators are keen to see public blockchain adopted and are rapidly dismantling regulatory obstacles, leaving the world's banks on an uneven playing field.

OMFIF has created the Public Blockchain Working Group with the support of Aptos, Hedera, Minsait (Indra Group), Ripple and Stellar Development Foundation. The group met with six financial and bank regulators to examine the challenges involved in regulating the use of public blockchain at commercial banks.

This report is the result of those conversations. It argues that the products and tools exist to ensure that public blockchains can deliver the features required of the technology that underpins financial market infrastructure, and that any novel risks the architecture presents can be effectively mitigated. Financial institutions should therefore be able to decide for themselves what protocols best fit their needs.

The carriage workshop, which also had evidence of fixing horseshoes, was situated along the well-traveled Via Claudia Augusta and offered services to travelers in the first century C.E.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A smattering of iron pieces and an array of nails discovered in the remains of a first century Roman building provided some clues as to what the ancient site's use must have been. According to experts, the site (located along the Via Claudia Augusta) was likely the Roman equivalent of a body shop—a.k.a. a carriage workshop and horseshoe repair stop.  

According to a translated statement from the Italian province in which the site was found, the local Office of Archaeological Heritage of the Provincial Superintendence of Cultural Heritage and a team of archaeologists excavated the area ahead of a residential construction project, and discovered the foundation of a Roman building broken into two distinct sections.

The excavation resulted in evidence pointing to the site having once been a metalworking shop—one specifically tied to an ancient Roman posting station serving the needs of travelers by repairing carriages and horseshoes. Other remnants of the ancient business included a pit with evidence of charcoal and metal slag, along with a litany of iron pieces and nails. 

The new discovery adds to what was previously known about the ancient Egna settlement. Historically called Endidae, it was known for acting as a way stop along the Roman road network. This find further cements the site as a key travelers' workshop in a likely high-traffic area. Trading was heavy along the Via Claudia Augusta. 

The team also uncovered Roman roof tiles stamped with the manufacturer's name (Auresis)—which could help track where the objects came from—as well as a mix of other items popular in Roman trade, such as fragments of ceramic and glass pots, pieces of amphorae, and five coins. Experts date all the finds to between the first and third centuries C.E., keeping them in line with previous discoveries nearby. 

The statement explained that along with the artifact discoveries, the location of the building—which the team is calling the “Mansio Endidae”—solidifies it as a key posting station on a road that served as a rest stop for officials and their horses. Located on the elevated side of the road, the station would have been a striking visual marker for travelers nearing the area, sitting along the road that connected northern Italy with what is now Innsbruck, Austria, and Munich, Germany. 

The metalworking shop would have offered additional services for the posting station, likely focused on the repair of carriages and horseshoes,as well as tools for other repairs required by travelers or those living and working in the settlement.

Engineering heterologous natural product pathways in bacteria has achieved broad success but most approaches suffer from low initial production levels that require extensive, resource-heavy iterative strain optimization. Xanthommatin is a structurally complex, color-changing animal ommochrome with material and cosmetic applications, yet production in microbial cell factories has been difficult. Here, we introduce a growth-coupled biosynthetic strategy involving a feedback loop where an excised one-carbon (C1) moiety is used as a driver of bacterial growth, simultaneously boosting bioproduction of the target compound. This broadly applicable, plug-and-play strategy is illustrated by enabling xanthommatin biosynthesis in a 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate auxotroph of the platform soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida. In this design, formate released during xanthommatin production relieves the C1 deficiency, thereby effectively coupling bacterial growth to pigment synthesis. Adaptive laboratory evolution streamlined xanthommatin's gram-scale bioproduction from glucose, establishing C1 restoration as a general biosynthetic approach to accelerate the engineering of natural product biosynthesis in bacteria.

a. 2D flux spaces spanned by growth rate and formate uptake rate for a P. putida wild-type strain (iJN1463) and its derivative PUMA including the heterologous formate assimilation pathway and the knockout of the glycine cleavage system (gcvTHP) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase (glyA). b. Flux space of the PUMA strain with a glycine supplementation is additionally shown. c. Metabolic destinations of the derivatives from the formate assimilation in the PUMA metabolic model and a corresponding flux distribution are shown. Fluxes are given relative to an arbitrary formate uptake rate of 100. A glucose minimal medium was applied under aerobic conditions for all simulations.

Strains EM42-Kyn (a), PUMA-Kyn (b), EM42-Xa (c) and PUMA-Xa (d) were cultivated in shake flasks filled with 20% (v/v) minimal salt medium (MSM) containing glucose (20 mM), glycine (5 mM) and L-tryptophan (5 mM). Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviation of two biological replicates (n = 2). Abbreviations include L-kynurenine (Kyn), kynurenic acid (KYNA), L-3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK), xanthurenic acid (XANA), xanthommatin (Xa), and decarboxylated Xa (DC-Xa).

PUMA is not able to grow in the absence of glycine whereas ‘re-engineered' PUMA mutants show growth comparable to an ePUMA clonal isolate. Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviation of two biological replicates (n = 2).

Whole-genome sequencing of clonal isolates from endpoint populations of ePUMA-Kyn and ePUMA-Xa, weaned from L-tryptophan supplementation, revealed mutations in the promoter region controlling expression of qbs biosynthetic genes.

Mutant plasmids were isolated from single clones (ALE IDs indicated) of ePUMA-kyn(Win) and ePUMA-Xa(Win) and transformed into the PUMA and ePUMA strains. The PUMA strains harboring the mutant plasmids were able to grow in MSM containing glucose (20 mM) and glycine (5 mM) in the absence of L-tryptophan whereas the PUMA strain carrying the original pS4413-qbsFH or pS4413-qbsFGH plasmid did not. Similarly, ePUMA only grew in MSM containing glucose as the sole carbon source when carrying mutant pS4413-qbsFH and pS4413-qbsFGH plasmids, but not the originals. Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviation of two biological replicates (n = 2).

Feeding with [2-13C]glucose yields L-tryptophan (indole-2-¹³C). Labeled L-tryptophan is oxidized by QbsF, generating N-formyl-L-kynurenine, which is hydrolyzed by QbsH, yielding 13C-formate, which is ligated to THF by formate-THF ligase (FtfL), yielding labeled 10-formyl-THF13.C-formate is then incorporated into purine nucleotides by PurH. The 5-phosphoribosyl group of 5-phosphoribosyl diphosphate (PRPP) is transferred to ATP, yielding phosphoribosyl-ATP and inorganic pyrophosphate (not shown). Additional transformations yield N-(5'-Phospho-D-1'-ribulosylformimino)-5-amino-1-(5”-phospho-D-ribosyl)-4-imidazolecarboxamide (PRFAR) and ultimately histidine, which contains a labeled carbon, derived from ATP.

Data are presented as Labeling experiments are averages from two biological replicates (n = 2)samples harvested at the end of exponential growth. In all cases standard deviations were ≤0.96%.

Strains EM42-Kyn (a), ePUMA-Kyn(Win) (b), EM42-Xa (c) and ePUMA-Xa(Win) (d) were cultivated in shake flasks filled with 20% (v/v) MSM containing 20 mM glucose. Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviation of two biological replicates (n = 2). Abbreviations include L-kynurenine (Kyn), kynurenic acid (KYNA), L-3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK), xanthurenic acid (XANA), xanthommatin (Xa), and decarboxylated Xa (DC-Xa).

a. A growth plot showing glucose concentration over the course of the fermentation. b. Samples taken every 6 h from the fermentation broth show a visual increase in xanthommatin production as indicated by the yellow to brown color change. c. and d. Fermentation was performed in a 250 mL Ambr microbioreactor. The final culture broth was colored deep burgundy.

A P. putida methylenetetrahydrofolate auxotroph was generated from parental strain P. putida EM42 via five genomic modifications, which included deletion of glyA-I, glyA-II, and gcv-II, insertion of a formate assimilation module (P4→mtdA-fch-ftfL) and deletion of gcv-I, in that order. The resulting strain named PUMA was subjected to adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) to remove its dependence on exogenous glycine for growth in minimal medium. One of the evolved populations of the resulting glycine-independent strain, named ePUMA, was transformed with the pathway plasmids pS4413-qbsFH or pS4413-qbsFGH, to generate ePUMA-Kyn and ePUMA-Xa, respectively. Single transformants were subsequently subjected to ALE in parallel to remove the dependence on exogenous L-tryptophan for growth in minimal medium. The resulting strains ePUMA-Kyn(Win) and ePUMA-Xa(Win) grow in minimal medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source.

Cognition deteriorates less rapidly in people with Alzheimer's disease who take at least 3,000 to 5,000 steps per day. Credit: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg/Getty

When it comes to preventing Alzheimer's disease, every step counts. For older people whose brains have begun to show molecular signs of the disease, but who have yet to display any cognitive symptoms, taking as few as 3,000 to 5,000 steps per day can help to stave off mental decline, a study finds1.

That level of activity slows cognitive decline by 3 years, on average, the results show. And in similar individuals who walk further, taking 5,000 to 7,500 steps per day, decline slows by an average of 7 years. The work also offers hints to how exercise alters the brain to offer this protection.

“The very encouraging takeaway is that even a little bit of exercise seems to help,” says Wai-Ying Wendy Yau, a physician-scientist specializing in memory disorders at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, and a co-author of the study, which was published on 3 November in Nature Medicine. The research indicates that people don't need to take 10,000 steps a day, a goal that is often touted but might be hard for some older individuals to attain, she says.

The research team ran regular checks on 296 people participating in the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a programme that is investigating the early stages of Alzheimer's. None of them had signs of cognitive impairment at the beginning of the study. Over a period of up to 14 years, the team periodically assessed the participants — whose ages ranged from 50 to 90 — using cognitive tests and brain scans. Participants were also asked to wear pedometers to measure how many steps they took each day.

The brains of people at a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease usually show an abnormal build-up of two proteins: amyloid-β and tau. Although the relationship between the two proteins is not fully understood, amyloid-β levels begin to increase first, followed by tau levels. Cognitive decline seems to be more closely tied to the accumulation of tau.

The benefits of taking 3,000 to 7,500 steps per day were apparent only for participants with high baseline levels of amyloid-β in their brains. Their mental decline was slowed — by 3 to 7 years — compared with participants who were sedentary. The researchers didn't see any further slowing of mental decline in participants who took more than 7,500 steps a day.

Back in the 2010s, a website called Let Me Google That For You gained a notable amount of popularity for serving a single purpose: snark.

The site lets you generate a custom link that you can send somebody who asks you a question. When they click the link, it plays an animation of the process of typing a question into Google. The idea is to show the person asking the question how easy it would have been for them to just look up the answer themselves.

It's an insult, basically. It's funny and rude.

Now, there's nothing wrong with a little rudeness in the right context. If an openly hostile person is wasting your time on social media by asking easily researched questions, I think you should go ahead and enjoy a little passive aggression (as a treat).

In more personal contexts, though, using Let Me Google That For You states clearly that you don't respect the person you gave the link to, and that their question is a waste of your time. If someone from your workplace or your personal life is asking you a question, it's because they want your specific input, so it's better to just give the answer—ideally with context only you can provide—than it is to send a link to a Google search results page.

Now, this being 2025, the people behind Let Me Google That For You also offer Let Me ChatGPT That For You, which works exactly the way you think it does. And its existence points to something new: how rude it is to, in response to a question, respond with AI output—especially in a more professional context.

Telling someone to Google something can be funny and satisfying, but it's not helpful. I'd put copy-pasting or screenshotting a conversation with ChatGPT, Claude, or any other AI agent in the same category: not helpful and kind of rude.

Developer Alex Martsinovich touched on this a while ago in a blog post called it's rude to show AI output to people: “Be polite, and don't send humans AI text,” he writes. “My own take on AI etiquette is that AI output can only be relayed if it's either adopted as your own or there is explicit consent from the receiving party.” I think this is a pretty good framework for AI etiquette.

If someone asks you a question, when they could have asked the machine instead, it's because they wanted your perspective. The internet exists, at least in theory, so that humans can connect with each other, and so that we can benefit from each other's knowledge. Responding to a question with AI output ignores this dynamic, especially if you don't say that's what you're doing.

Again: There are situations where you may want to be rude. That doesn't make it less rude.

But there's another reason sharing AI output is kind of rude: it could be flat out wrong.

While models are getting better all the time, they still make (occasionally hilarious) mistakes. Sharing the output of a large language model in conversations, without checking it yourself for accuracy, means you could potentially be sharing misinformation.

Even worse, because you didn't state you were sharing AI output, you're giving the person you're sharing the output with the impression that you can vouch for the information.

None of this is to say that AI isn't useful, or that you can't use it to answer questions people ask. But as with Googling, using AI to answer questions isn't the end of the job—it's the beginning.

When I use AI as a research tool, it's a way to find primary sources. I ask for an overview, sure, but I also ask for articles and studies to read on a subject. Then I read those sources myself in order to decide whether the AI's summary of the subject matter is accurate or not. I'll likely even follow up with a few of the people involved.

I, as a journalist, consider this doing my due diligence. If an editor asks me a question about a statement in an article I don't just ask ChatGPT. I dig down to primary sources, or as close as I can get, and point to them. I'm sure your profession has a similar level of due diligence.

AI can be an amazing starting point for research, but you have more to offer than a starting point. Use these tools to show what you can do, not as an alternative to doing things.

Google announced on Monday that its Chrome browser can now fill in your passport, driver's license, vehicle registration, and more as part of its auto-fill feature.

The addition expands Chrome's existing ability to automatically fill in your addresses, passwords, and payment information.

Desktop users who have enhanced autofill enabled will see their passport and driver's license number, vehicle information — like their license plate or VIN — and more automatically filled in on web pages when they're prompted to enter them.

Google says Chrome can now also better understand complex forms and varied formatting requirements, which will improve accuracy across the web.

The tech giant notes that Chrome only saves autofill data when you give it permission to do so and that the browser will protect this information through encryption. Additionally, before Chrome fills in saved information on your behalf, it will ask you to confirm.

These new updates are available globally in all languages starting Monday. In the coming months, Chrome plans to add support for even more data types, the company says.

Monday's announcement comes as Google has been adding additional functionality to Chrome to make it more helpful amid the surge of new AI browsers.

A few weeks ago, Google rolled out Gemini in Chrome to all Mac and Windows desktop users in the U.S. after previously limiting the capability to Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra subscribers. The tech giant also announced at the time that it plans to bring agentic capabilities to Chrome in the future, add its AI Mode search feature to the address bar, launch new Gemini features, use AI to combat AI-generated scams, roll out automatic password resets, and more.

Other smaller features that have launched on Chrome recently include a new tool that automatically disables browser notifications for the websites you haven't interacted with recently, along with a feature that makes it easier to switch between work and personal Google accounts.

Meta on Monday announced an update to Facebook Groups that will allow admins to make their previously private groups public, without compromising the privacy of their existing members. The company said that past content will remain private after the conversion, and member lists will remain protected.

Often, admins start their groups as private, thinking they will remain small, but then realize they could reach a much broader audience if they were easier to find. This update will allow Facebook Groups to expand their reach without having to start a public group from scratch or exposing their members' past posts.

According to Meta, the change to the group's privacy can be made from the settings page on Facebook. When an admin changes the private group's status to public, all other admins are notified of the change and have a three-day window to review and cancel the conversion if not everyone agrees.

After the update, all past group content — including posts, comments, and reactions — will only be visible to members who were in the group before the conversion, as well as to admins and moderators. Member lists are also protected and only visible to admins and moderators.

Members are also notified about the change and will be reminded again when they post or comment for the first time in the newly public group.

After the conversion to public, new posts, comments, and reactions will be visible to anyone, including those who aren't on Facebook, as with any other public group. This could also help Facebook's content be more easily indexed by search engines like Google, which can then surface these groups in their search results for related queries.

If the admins decide that being a public group isn't the right call, they can revert the group to private again.

In this conversation, the FT's John Thornhill and MIT Technology Review's Caiwei Chen consider the battle between Silicon Valley and Beijing for technological supremacy.

The State of AI is a collaboration between the Financial Times & MIT Technology Review examining the ways in which AI is reshaping global power. Every Monday for the next six weeks, writers from both publications will debate one aspect of the generative AI revolution reshaping global power.

In this conversation, the FT's tech columnist and Innovation Editor John Thornhill and MIT Technology Review's Caiwei Chen consider the battle between Silicon Valley and Beijing for technological supremacy.

John Thornhill writes:

Viewed from abroad, it seems only a matter of time before China emerges as the AI superpower of the 21st century. 

Here in the West, our initial instinct is to focus on America's significant lead in semiconductor expertise, its cutting-edge AI research, and its vast investments in data centers. The legendary investor Warren Buffett once warned: “Never bet against America.” He is right that for more than two centuries, no other “incubator for unleashing human potential” has matched the US.

Today, however, China has the means, motive, and opportunity to commit the equivalent of technological murder. When it comes to mobilizing the whole-of-society resources needed to develop and deploy AI to maximum effect, it may be just as rash to bet against. 

The data highlights the trends. In AI publications and patents, China leads. By 2023, China accounted for 22.6% of all citations, compared with 20.9% from Europe and 13% from the US, according to Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2025. As of 2023, China also accounted for 69.7% of all AI patents. True, the US maintains a strong lead in the top 100 most cited publications (50 versus 34 in 2023), but its share has been steadily declining. 

Similarly, the US outdoes China in top AI research talent, but the gap is narrowing. According to a report from the US Council of Economic Advisers, 59% of the world's top AI researchers worked in the US in 2019, compared with 11% in China. But by 2022 those figures were 42% and 28%. 

The Trump administration's tightening of restrictions for foreign H-1B visa holders may well lead more Chinese AI researchers in the US to return home. The talent ratio could move further in China's favor.

Regarding the technology itself, US-based institutions produced 40 of the world's most notable AI models in 2024, compared with 15 from China. But Chinese researchers have learned to do more with less, and their strongest large language models—including the open-source DeepSeek-V3 and Alibaba's Qwen 2.5-Max—surpass the best US models in terms of algorithmic efficiency.

Where China is really likely to excel in future is in applying these open-source models. The latest report from Air Street Capital shows that China has now overtaken the US in terms of monthly downloads of AI models. In AI-enabled fintech, e-commerce, and logistics, China already outstrips the US. 

Perhaps the most intriguing—and potentially the most productive—applications of AI may yet come in hardware, particularly in drones and industrial robotics. With the research field evolving toward embodied AI, China's advantage in advanced manufacturing will shine through.

Dan Wang, the tech analyst and author of Breakneck, has rightly highlighted the strengths of China's engineering state in developing manufacturing process knowledge—even if he has also shown the damaging effects of applying that engineering mentality in the social sphere. “China has been growing technologically stronger and economically more dynamic in all sorts of ways,” he told me. “But repression is very real. And it is getting worse in all sorts of ways as well.”

I'd be fascinated to hear from you, Caiwei, about your take on the strengths and weaknesses of China's AI dream. To what extent will China's engineered social control hamper its technological ambitions? 

Caiwei Chen responds:

Hi, John!

You're right that the US still holds a clear lead in frontier research and infrastructure. But “winning” AI can mean many different things. Jeffrey Ding, in his book Technology and the Rise of Great Powers, makes a counterintuitive point: For a general-purpose technology like AI, long-term advantage often comes down to how widely and deeply technologies spread across society. And China is in a good position to win that race (although “murder” might be pushing it a bit!).

Chips will remain China's biggest bottleneck. Export restrictions have throttled access to top GPUs, pushing buyers into gray markets and forcing labs to recycle or repair banned Nvidia stock. Even as domestic chip programs expand, the performance gap at the very top still stands.

Yet those same constraints have pushed Chinese companies toward a different playbook: pooling compute, optimizing efficiency, and releasing open-weight models. DeepSeek-V3's training run, for example, used just 2.6 million GPU-hours—far below the scale of US counterparts. But Alibaba's Qwen models now rank among the most downloaded open-weights globally, and companies like Zhipu and MiniMax are building competitive multimodal and video models. 

China's industrial policy means new models can move from lab to implementation fast. Local governments and major enterprises are already rolling out reasoning models in administration, logistics, and finance. 

Education is another advantage. Major Chinese universities are implementing AI literacy programs in their curricula, embedding skills before the labor market demands them. The Ministry of Education has also announced plans to integrate AI training for children of all school ages. I'm not sure the phrase “engineering state” fully captures China's relationship with new technologies, but decades of infrastructure building and top-down coordination have made the system unusually effective at pushing large-scale adoption, often with far less social resistance than you'd see elsewhere. The use at scale, naturally, allows for faster iterative improvements.

Meanwhile, Stanford HAI's 2025 AI Index found Chinese respondents to be the most optimistic in the world about AI's future—far more optimistic than populations in the US or the UK. It's striking, given that China's economy has slowed since the pandemic for the first time in over two decades. Many in government and industry now see AI as a much-needed spark. Optimism can be powerful fuel, but whether it can persist through slower growth is still an open question.

Social control remains part of the picture, but a different kind of ambition is taking shape. The Chinese AI founders in this new generation are the most globally minded I've seen, moving fluidly between Silicon Valley hackathons and pitch meetings in Dubai. Many are fluent in English and in the rhythms of global venture capital. Having watched the last generation wrestle with the burden of a Chinese label, they now build companies that are quietly transnational from the start.

The US may still lead in speed and experimentation, but China could shape how AI becomes part of daily life, both at home and abroad. Speed matters, but speed isn't the same thing as supremacy.

John Thornhill replies:

You're right, Caiwei, that speed is not the same as supremacy (and “murder” may be too strong a word). And you're also right to amplify the point about China's strength in open-weight models and the US preference for proprietary models. This is not just a struggle between two different countries' economic models but also between two different ways of deploying technology.  

Even OpenAI's chief executive, Sam Altman, admitted earlier this year: “We have been on the wrong side of history here and need to figure out a different open-source strategy.” That's going to be a very interesting subplot to follow. Who's called that one right?

Earth's average temperature is nearing critical thresholds as the international community lags behind its emissions goals. As a result, bold technological strategies to cool the planet have gained attention in recent years, and now, Elon Musk is weighing in.

Early Monday morning, Musk took to X to share his two cents on how to address the climate crisis. He claimed that using satellites for solar radiation management (SRM)—a theoretical geoengineering technique that would allow humans to control the amount of sunlight reaching Earth—would be an effective solution.

“A large solar-powered AI satellite constellation would be able to prevent global warming by making tiny adjustments in how much solar energy reached Earth,” Musk wrote.

When asked how this would ensure precise, equitable adjustments to solar energy across the planet—while also accounting for seasonal variations and potential geopolitical conflicts over control—Musk replied: “Yes. It would only take tiny adjustments to prevent global warming or global cooling for that matter. Earth has been a snowball [many] times in the past.”

So, it would appear he doesn't quite have all the answers. That said, it's certainly notable that the wealthiest man on Earth and the CEO of the world's largest satellite company is advocating for space-based SRM. Experts warn, however, that this strategy is both highly unrealistic and dangerous.

Musk isn't the only entrepreneur interested in blocking out the Sun. A growing number of companies are exploring different approaches to SRM, from using atmospheric aerosols to mimic the sunlight-blocking effects of volcanic eruptions to launching thousands of mirrors into orbit.

While some of these companies have raised significant capital and have set ambitious near-term targets for development and testing, none are anywhere close to deploying their technology at scale. If Musk's SpaceX wades into this burgeoning industry, these startups will suddenly find a very big fish in their very small pond.

But to be clear, Musk has not shared any plans for SpaceX to develop SRM-capable satellites. And even with the company's billion-dollar valuation and the enormous Starlink constellation it has already deployed, doing so would be far easier said than done.

The first hurdle SpaceX would face is a pivot away from producing Starlink communications satellites to developing the artificially intelligent, solar-powered, SRM-capable satellites Musk described. And no, the nearly 9,000 operational Starlinks currently in orbit could not be adapted for this purpose. Alternatively, SpaceX could launch an entirely new satellite division devoted to this geoengineering project while simultaneously managing Starlink.

While Musk did not share specifics on how these satellites would work, they would likely be equipped with mirrors or sunshades that come together in formation to create a gigantic, manipulatable barrier between Earth and the Sun. When we say gigantic—we really mean it.

Scientists don't know exactly how many SRM satellites it would take to make a meaningful difference in Earth's average temperature, but estimates range so high that many experts consider this solution infeasible. The cost of deployment alone would likely prove insurmountable even for Musk, with estimates in the multi-trillion-dollar range.

Even if Musk could make this happen, that doesn't mean he should. Experts have long warned of the potential consequences of space-based SRM, which could trigger major, unintended changes in Earth's climate, the day-night cycle, biodiversity, geopolitical tensions, and more.

Avoiding these consequences—and actually mitigating global warming—would require unprecedented technological control and international governance over the largest and most impactful satellite constellation ever deployed.

Needless to say, it's not happening anytime soon. Still, Musk's growing interest in this technology will undoubtedly attract attention to this nascent industry, potentially fueling innovation and debate over how far geoengineering can and should go.

The IP firm claims AMD's stacked cache relies on its patented bonding methods.

Adeia has filed a pair of patent infringement lawsuits against AMD in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, claiming that AMD's chips incorporate patented innovations covered by its hybrid bonding IP portfolio.

The company says ten patents are at issue — seven covering hybrid bonding and three tied to process nodes used in advanced logic and memory manufacturing. The litigation, announced November 3, follows what Adeia describes as years of failed licensing talks. AMD has not yet commented.

Hybrid bonding technology sits at the heart of AMD's 3D V-Cache design, the feature that gives Ryzen X3D processors their gaming advantage and server-class cache density. Instead of solder bumps, it fuses copper and dielectric surfaces directly between dies, creating a near-monolithic connection at micron-scale pitch. That allows a 64MB slab of SRAM to be stacked on each Zen compute die without overwhelming its thermal or electrical limits. The technique is widely understood to use TSMC's SoIC process family, a form of hybrid bonding that enables ultra-dense 3D integration.

Adeia, which spun out of Xperi, claims ownership of a large portfolio of bonding and interconnect IP. Its DBI and ZiBond technologies have already been licensed to major players in memory, CMOS image sensors, and 3D NAND. The company now argues AMD's products make “extensive use” of the same concepts, asserting that its patented work has “greatly contributed” to AMD's success.

Hybrid bonding could be the foundation for the next phase of chip scaling, as performance gains shift from transistor density to vertical integration. AMD's roadmap leans heavily on stacked designs, not just for Ryzen but for EPYC and future accelerators that layer compute, memory, and I/O. If Adeia's claims survive early procedural challenges, the case could test how much of that stack belongs to the IP holder and how much to the foundry in any judgments that follow.

Few expect any near-term disruption to AMD's products, since injunctions in patent cases of this kind are rarely granted under post-eBay v. MercExchange precedent. The more immediate question is whether Adeia's claims can survive the early procedural hurdles that often decide the outcome long before trial.

AMD and its foundry partners are almost certain to challenge the patents through inter partes review at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, arguing that the asserted claims are either too broad or already covered by TSMC's process IP.

If the patents hold up, the case could set a new boundary between proprietary bonding methods and foundry-specific implementations, effectively defining who owns the connective tissue of 3D chip design. A negotiated settlement remains the most likely outcome, but the ruling could influence how every hybrid-bonded processor, from Ryzen to Intel's Foveros Direct, is valued in future licensing deals.

QUEBEC CITY — The cardiovascular sequelae of COVID and its vaccinations are an ongoing clinical challenge in Canada, such that the Canadian Cardiovascular Society dedicated an educational session at the Canadian Cardiovascular Congress (CCC) 2025 to the scope of the problem and how to address it.

“A lot of people still do not believe that [long COVID] exists until they see a few patients of their own,” Thao Huynh, MD, cardiologist at the McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, told Medscape News Canada.

“Everybody should be able to treat long COVID patients,” said Huynh, who offers peer-to-peer education on the topic. But to do so requires “patience and empathy” and a willingness to work through the symptoms with the patient. A goal of the educational session was to help clinicians do just that.

Naveed Janjua, MBBS, DrPH, executive director of epidemiology and intelligence services at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, Vancouver, shared epidemiologic data on the cardiovascular impact of COVID. A population-based study conducted in British Columbia revealed an increased risk for major cardiovascular adverse events (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.34) and acute myocardial infarction (adjusted HR, 1.65) following SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a median follow-up period of 260 days. In addition, a meta-analysis of post-acute cardiovascular effects of COVID revealed a greater than fivefold increased risk for myocarditis in the year following the index infection (HR, 5.16).

Huynh followed with a report on her experience treating patients with long COVID-related myopericarditis. She and her team showed in the IMPACT QUEBEC COVID-19 Long Haul Study that, among a sample of 276 patients with a post-COVID condition, 38% had cardiac involvement confirmed via MRI. Symptoms were debilitating and most often included dyspnea (95%), pleuritic chest pain (86%), and palpitations (84%).

A major challenge to diagnosing long COVID-related myopericarditis is that preliminary testing (including C-reactive protein and troponin levels, as well as echocardiography) typically yields normal results. More useful diagnostic tests include sedimentation rate and N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide, but these tests can also be normal in the context of severe myopericarditis, which is usually identifiable via cardiac MRI (CMR).

Wait times for CMR can be months or even years in Canada, so Huynh recommended starting treatment in the context of high clinical suspicion, even before receiving a confirmatory CMR. To make the diagnosis, she said, physicians must “listen to the patient,” which can be difficult for cardiologists who see a high volume of patients each day.

Bias can also be a barrier. “The majority of cardiologists are men. The majority of patients with long COVID are female, and there's a myth that the females [with long COVID] have a psychiatric disease,” she said.

Huynh's first-line approach to treatment is colchicine, with anakinra as a second-line option, if accessible. She emphasized that patients absolutely require treatment because they are highly debilitated and do not recover spontaneously, even after several years.

One should not take a wait-and-see approach to this condition, Huynh said. She would like to try other anti-inflammatory biologic therapies, but insurance will not cover off-label use, and Huynh has been unable to secure support from industry.

In rare cases, myocarditis can occur following vaccination for COVID, Michael Khoury, MD, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, said during the presentation that followed. The incidence of vaccine-related myocarditis overall is approximately 1.2 per 100,000 doses, but this estimate increases to as high as 39 per 100,000 doses among adolescent and young adult males, who represent the group at highest risk.

The pathway to diagnosis for vaccine-induced myocarditis is more straightforward than that for long COVID-related myopericarditis, said Huynh. Young men typically arrive at the emergency department with chest pain and receive a CMR, which often shows fibrosis and may also reveal reduced ejection fraction. Nevertheless, CMR can be delayed in these patients as well.

Vaccine-induced myocarditis is also much more likely to resolve on its own after 3-6 months, although patients must be closely monitored during this period and limit physical activity. Many patients continue to have evidence of fibrosis on CMR, and the long-term implications of this finding are unknown.

The MYCOVACC study is monitoring myocarditis following messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID vaccination across Canada, and an update of this effort was presented by Nathaniel Hawkins, MD, MPH, assistant professor of cardiology at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. So far, the team has identified 359 cases, of which 51% are probably, 41% are definitely, and 8% are likely related to the mRNA vaccine. The most common manifestation is myocarditis (55.7%), but 13.5% of patients have pericarditis, and 30.8% have both. As expected, most cases are in young males.

Most cases occurred after receiving the original Pfizer (52%) or Moderna (44%) vaccine, usually when it was delivered as a first (24%) or second (64%) dose. The risk with the newer vaccines and with additional boosters is much lower, Hawkins said.

Symptoms (most commonly, chest pain and dyspnea) usually present within a week of receiving the vaccine. Patients are usually treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with or without colchicine, or cardiac medications (most often beta-blockers or renin-angiotensin system inhibitors). Patients often spend 1-4 nights in the hospital.

Janjua, Khoury, and Hawkins reported having no relevant financial relationships. Hyunh reported having received support from Moderna. The IMPACT-QUEBEC COVID-19 Long Haul Study received support from Pfizer. MYCOVACC was funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Substituting added sugars with sweeteners and sweetness enhancers (S&SEs) as part of a healthy diet for 1 year modestly supports weight loss maintenance and promotes favorable gut microbiota composition changes in adults with overweight or obesity, without adversely affecting cardiometabolic markers.

""S&SEs improve weight control and gut microbiota composition while having neutral effects on metabolic health,"" the lead author commented in an accompanying research highlight.

The study was led by Michelle D. Pang, BSc, Institute for Nutrition and Translational Research in Metabolism, Maastricht University Medical Centre+, Netherlands. It was published online in Nature Metabolism.

The trial had a higher-than-expected dropout rate (40% vs 30%), reducing statistical power. Energy intake may have been underestimated, with baseline consumption about 25% below the estimated energy requirements. Results for children should be interpreted cautiously due to limited sample size and suboptimal compliance. The absence of direct short-chain fatty acid measurements and detailed metagenomic-enabled functional analyses limited interpretation of the metabolic implications of microbiota changes. 

The study was funded by the Horizon 2020 programme. One author disclosed receiving honoraria from Nestlé, Unilever, and the International Sweeteners Association, and employment by Novo Nordisk. Other authors disclosed receiving project funding, travel supporting, consultancy fees, and other ties with various organizations.

High-dose, rapid-escalation oral immunotherapy (OIT) with an adjunct probiotic was effective for treating hen's egg and milk allergies in children, the small, open-label PREMO trial from Australia found.

Reporting findings in Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, Mimi L.K. Tang, MD, allergist/immunologist at Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne, and colleagues said the treatment strategy may increase the likelihood of achieving sustained unresponsiveness (SU) and shorten the required treatment period.

“The findings provide observational evidence that this approach was highly effective at binding remission of allergy,” Tang told Medscape Medical News. “We now need to confirm efficacy and safety in a blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.” 

Alongside peanuts, hen's eggs and cow's milk are among the three most common causes of pediatric immunoglobulin E-mediated food allergies. 

“In Australia, egg allergy is the single most common food allergy during infancy, but because the majority — about 80% — resolve during school years, peanut and tree nuts assume greatest prevalence by late primary and early secondary school,” said Tang.

High-dose, rapid-escalation OIT previously proved successful for treating peanut allergy in the PPOIT-003 study, achieving high SU rates of 46%-74%.

The current open-label proof-of-concept trial enrolled 40 girls and boys ages 5 to 17 (mean age just over 9 years) with egg (n = 20) or milk (n = 20) allergy as confirmed by double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). The children received the gut-friendly probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and appropriate OIT for 18 months, with SU assessed by DBPCFC posttreatment and after 8 weeks of dietary allergen exclusion. “We selected L rhamnosus GG based on its many tolerogenic effects,” Tang said.

The primary outcome was the proportion completing the dose-escalation phase; secondary outcomes were the proportion achieving SU, adverse events, and change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL).

Nine (45%) egg and seven (35%) milk OIT participants completed dose escalation, and 17 (85%) in both groups were able to reach the maintenance phase with appropriate dose modifications. Eleven (55%) egg and 10 (50%) milk participants attained SU, and clinically significant improvements in HRQOL were observed in both groups.

Treatment-emergent adverse events, however, were frequent, with moderate or severe episodes documented in nine (45%) egg and 13 (65%) milk participants. Adverse events included gastrointestinal, respiratory, skin, and cardiovascular manifestations, and more than half of the participants required dose adjustments. Three quarters of treatment completers achieved SU and improved quality of life.

“The very high levels of SU attained during PREMO suggest that the combination of rapid updosing with a minimum of 12 months of maintenance dosing may offer an efficient and effective treatment option for many patients,” the authors wrote. “Clinicians practicing OIT should consider the trade-off between the speed of up-dosing and the required duration of maintenance dosing.”

As to an adjunct probiotic, while it may have enhanced efficacy, it was not supported by results from PPOIT­003, in which a probiotic reduced gastrointestinal symptoms but did not lead to higher SU rates.

Offering a US perspective on the study, Jeffrey Factor, MD, executive director of the New England Food Allergy Treatment Center in West Hartford, Connecticut, commended the authors for showing that their protocol resulted in many patients reaching maintenance and attaining SU.

“But this was an uncontrolled open-label study without a placebo arm, and that limits the significance of their findings and observations with probiotic therapy,” he told Medscape Medical News. “Additionally, there's the high occurrence rate of adverse reactions, many of which were classified as moderate-to-severe, in the study populations — both egg, 45%, and milk, 65%. These levels are high and would warrant a less aggressive protocol.”

As to adjunct probiotic therapy, the emergence of biologics such as omalizumab, now approved for preventing anaphylaxis due to multiple food allergies, could make other adjuncts such as probiotics less desirable, Factor said.

Tang's group is investigating potential patient factors that modify treatment efficacy. “We will continue to examine available data to gain a deeper understanding of key effect modifiers of OIT,” she said.

This study was jointly funded by Prota Therapeutics and Murdoch Children's Research Institute. Tang disclosed receiving consultant fees from CSL Seqirus and Pfizer, as well as interest/options in Prota Therapeutics. She reported being a member of the medical advisory board of Anaphylaxis & Anaphylaxis Australia, the board of directors of the Asia Pacific Association of Allergy, Asthma, and Clinical Immunology, AllergyPal, and Prota Therapeutics; and expert committees of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology, the Asia Pacific Association of Allergy, Asthma, and Clinical Immunology, and the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy.

Co-author Loke reported receiving consultant fees from SPRIM Consulting and an institutional grant from Siolta Therapeutics, outside of the submitted work. Factor reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

A hidden atrial dysfunction may raise stroke risk in people with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM); however, a non-invasive assessment tool may help identify those at increased risk, according to a preliminary study to be presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2025. The disease is a progressive condition that stiffens the heart muscle and may raise the risk of stroke, even when the heart rhythm appears normal.

The meeting, Nov. 7-10, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science.

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a potentially fatal disease that has historically been considered rare. However, it is difficult to know the actual number of people with the disorder because it is often underrecognized. In this condition, a protein called transthyretin becomes misshapen and accumulates in the heart, nerves and other organs. This protein buildup can stiffen the heart walls, making it difficult for the left ventricle to relax and fill with a regular heart rhythm. Patients also face a significant risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) – a temporary blockage of blood to the brain. However, no tool exists to identify those at highest risk for stroke or TIA from this condition, according to the study.

Even with a regular heart rhythm, some people with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy are still at risk of stroke if their atrium doesn't squeeze well. Our study indicates that atrial contraction may matter as much as heart rhythm in predicting risk. This hidden dysfunction could help guide earlier conversations and treatment about preventive strategies including anticoagulation medications.""

Aldostefano Porcari, M.D., Ph.D., study author, consultant cardiologist at Cardiovascular Department, University of Trieste, Italy, and researcher at the National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London

Researchers at the U.K. National Amyloidosis Centre analyzed health records between 2003 and 2023 and reviewed those of more than 2,300 adults with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. About 1 in 8 of the patients with regular heart rhythm had atrial electromechanical dissociation (AEMD), a condition where the upper heart chamber, the atrium, looks normal on an electrocardiogram, yet does not contract and pump blood effectively.

During nearly three years of follow-up, researchers found:

With this data, researchers developed a risk-prediction tool that uses two measures widely available on echocardiograms to measure the mechanical function of the atrial chamber. They found that stroke risk rose steadily as the atrium's ability to squeeze weakened. In the highest-risk group ­– people with poor contraction – the rate was about 9 strokes per 100 people each year. The risk pattern was consistent across people with different genetic subtypes of ATTR amyloidosis and across different disease stages, suggesting atrial dysfunction represents a common driver of stroke risk in this condition.

""These findings shift attention from rhythm function to how well the atrium actually squeezes,"" Porcari said.

The study is observational, so it cannot prove cause and effect. The next step is to conduct a prospective, multicenter study to investigate how this tool works and if preventive anticoagulation can lower the risk of stroke in people with atrial electromechanical dissociation. Researchers said the goal is to generate practice-ready evidence that can guide individualized decisions and, ultimately, help prevent disabling or fatal cerebrovascular events.

Fernando D. Testai, M.D., Ph.D., FAHA, vice-chair of the American Heart Association's Brain Health Committee, who was not involved in the study noted that ""patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy who remain in sinus rhythm still exhibit a significantly elevated stroke risk compared to the general population, so there is a need for novel strategies to identify high-risk individuals who may benefit from anticoagulation, even in the absence of atrial fibrillation.

""This study offers evidence of a strong predictor of future stroke or TIA,"" said Testai, professor of neurology and rehabilitation at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago. ""However, several challenges must be addressed before this approach can be integrated into clinical practice. The diagnosis of atrial electromechanical dissociation relied on speckle-tracking strain echocardiography, a specialized imaging technique which is not widely accessible and the findings require validation in larger, independent groups.""

The study reviewed data from one national center, so the results may not apply to all people with cardiac amyloidosis. Other limitations include that the classification of strokes was sometimes missing, and more research is needed to determine potential treatment options for people with AEMD.

In the fight against disease, programmed cell death – also known as apoptosis – is a key protective function of the body. It breaks down cells that are damaged or have undergone dangerous changes. However, cancer cells often manage to override this mechanism. A research team at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has now succeeded in identifying a new molecular switch in this process and elucidating how it works.

The activation and deactivation of apoptosis is a promising field of research in basic biomedical research. The team led by Prof. Franz Hagn from the Chair of Structural Membrane Biochemistry at the TUM School of Natural Sciences has now discovered a new switch: ""Many research teams worldwide are working on the exciting topic of apoptosis and its targeted control. The big advantage is that we are dealing with a highly efficient, evolutionarily developed regulatory mechanism. So, we don't have to invent something completely new, but can use the appropriate structural methods to learn from nature's optimized processes.""

To prevent healthy cells from accidentally destroying themselves, the apoptosis system is very balanced. The researchers were able to show that the protein Bcl-xL, an apoptosis inhibitor that prevents overreactions, can be overridden by another protein called VDAC1 when necessary. The activation of this essential protein in the mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, is mainly triggered by increased cell stress, which can be an indication of abnormal cell development. VDAC1 then unfolds part of its structure, connects it to Bcl-xL, and thus deactivates the inhibitor.

Dr. Umut Günsel and Dr. Melina Daniilidis, co-first authors of the study in Prof. Hagn's team at the Bavarian NMR Center, which is jointly supported by TUM and Helmholtz Munich, emphasize: ""In our study, we used high-resolution structural methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray crystallography, and cryo-electron microscopy to investigate how the VDAC1 protein changes under stress conditions. We also combined this data with biochemical functional experiments to show that VDAC1 actually binds to the brake protein Bcl-xL, thereby promoting apoptosis.""

This newly understood regulatory mechanism opens up possibilities for the search for active substances that could influence the behavior of VDAC1. In cancer therapy, for example, future drugs could specifically enhance activation and thus drive cancer cells to cell death. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, the opposite would be true. There, one could try to block the unwanted death of nerve cells. Deactivation of VDAC1 could also be helpful in certain heart diseases such as ischemia-reperfusion injury.

However, there is still a long way to go before these new findings can be applied clinically. The search for appropriate active substances can now begin. Whether it will be successful is completely open and will become clear after further experiments.

Napoli are reportedly plotting another transfer raid on Manchester, with United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo registering on their recruitment radar once more. The reigning Serie A champions were able to acquire Kevin De Bruyne over the summer, after seeing him leave City as a free agent, but the Belgian midfielder is currently ruled out with a thigh injury.

Antonio Conte is eager to reinforce his engine room, as Napoli compete on domestic and continental fronts, with collective sights being cast in the direction of proven Premier League performers.

According to Sky Sports, Napoli's interest in Mainoo is “for real”. They are reportedly working on a deal that could be pushed through in the January window. It is claimed that “the question of a departure is now more than ever on the table” when it comes to Mainoo and United.

The England international midfielder, who burst onto the scene after stepping out of the fabled academy system at Old Trafford, has been restricted to just eight appearances this season. His only start came in the Red Devils' humbling Carabao Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby.

Mainoo is yet to make a starting XI in the Premier League during the 2025-26 campaign, with Ruben Amorim favouring alternative midfield options in his 3-4-3 system. Serious questions were asked of the 20-year-old's future over the summer, but no deal was done. With game time proving limited, he is ready to reassess his options.

It is reported that “United are not considering a permanent transfer”, but Napoli are pushing for an initial loan agreement that includes a purchase option. Sky Sports claim that the Red Devils have “opened the door to a compromise”. Mainoo is said to be “tempted” by the opportunity to work with former Chelsea and Tottenham manager Conte.

A permanent deal for Mainoo could be pushed through in 2026 if certain terms are met, with the amount of appearances he makes over the second half of the season set to determine whether or not he remains in Italy alongside fellow United academy graduate Scott McTominay.

United are said to have “made it clear they would prefer to see the player in a foreign league rather than in the Premier League”, with several options that would keep Mainoo in English football being “ruled out”.

Mainoo may not be the only United star swapping the Premier League for Serie A during the winter window. Sky Sports also report on how Joshua Zirkzee could be treading that path. He only left Bologna for Old Trafford in the summer of 2024, but is another forward to have found the going tough in Manchester.

The Netherlands international is also yet to start a top-flight fixture for the Red Devils this season, with just five appearances being made in total. He has no goals to his name this term, having registered only seven across his debut campaign in England.

Zirkzee is said to have “told his entourage to find him a loan deal in January to revive his career”. He is considered to be “highly regarded” in Italy, having registered 12 goals for Bologna in the 2023-24 season.

Roma are considered to be the side most likely to do a deal for the Dutch forward, with talks already taking place. Zirkzee's representatives have discussed a “salary agreement” with the Giallorrossi, with it likely that he will need to accept a serious pay cut in order to make a move possible.

The Netherlands international is reportedly willing to pass up financial gain in order to get his career back on track. While Roma are leading the chase for his signature, it is also being suggested that AC Milan could join the race as they look to bring in more firepower at San Siro alongside the likes of USMNT star Christian Pulisic and Portugal international Rafael Leao. Any deal for Zirkzee would leave United short on striking options - having already allowed Rasmus Hojlund to join Napoli - with Benjamin Sesko being backed up by 17-year-old Danish wonderkid Chido Obi.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Ex-Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag under consideration for sensational Premier League return","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/ex-man-utd-boss-erik-ten-hag-premier-league-return-shock-candidate/bltb6cfed5af585646e","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 17:27:31 GMT","

Former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag could be set to return to English football after being considered for the vacant role at a Premier League club. Ten Hag is a free agent after being sacked by Bayer Leverkusen in September, becoming the first manager in Bundesliga history to lose his job after two games. He was fired by United in October 2024, four months after signing a new contract.

Ten Hag is among the candidates to succeed Vitor Pereira at Wolves, according to The Athletic. Pereira was relieved of his duties after Wolves were thrashed 3-0 by Fulham on Saturday, leaving them rooted to the bottom of the Premier League table with no wins from 10 games. The Portuguese became Wolves coach last December and steered them away from the relegation zone thanks to a six-game winning streak, their longest ever run of victories in the Premier League. He signed a new, three-year contract in September but was sacked six weeks later.

Wolves have expressed interest in speaking to Ten Hag, who was discussed internally as a potential candidate. However, The Athletic reports that Gary O'Neil is the frontrunner to take the vacant post at Molineux after holding advanced talks. It would be a remarkable turn of events if O'Neil accepted the job as he was only sacked by Wolves less than a year ago, being succeeded by Pereira.

The Dutchman had an excellent first season with United, leading the Red Devils to finish third in the Premier League while winning the Carabao Cup and reaching the FA Cup final (eventually losing to Manchester City) and making it to the quarter-finals of the Europa League. Despite further strengthening the squad by signing Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount and Andre Onana, he had a hugely disappointing second campaign. United came eighth in the league - their worst finish in the Premier League era at the time - and crashed out of the Champions League in the group stage. 

However, they managed to end on a positive note by winning the FA Cup and avenging their previous defeat by Manchester City at Wembley. The shock result led to United unexpectedly keeping faith in Ten Hag and extending his contract until 2026. However, just four months later he was dismissed following four defeats in the opening nine league games.

United's dismal results under successor Ruben Amorim, however, put Ten Hag's reign into some perspective. Under Amorim, United finished 15th in the Premier League, their worst league finish since being relegated 51 years previously, and failed to qualify for Europe after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.

Ten Hag was furious with the way he was sacked by Leverkusen following one defeat and one draw in the Bundesliga and a victory against lower league opposition in the cup. He blamed his bad results on the fact Leverkusen had sold a number of top players in the summer, many of whom had won the club's first ever Bundesliga title.

He said in a statement at the time: ""To part ways with a coach after just two league matches is unprecedented. This summer, many key players who were part of past successes left the squad. Building a new, cohesive team is a careful process that requires both time and trust. A new coach deserves the space to implement his vision, set the standards, shape the squad and leave his mark on the style of play.

""I started this job with full conviction and energy, but unfortunately the management was not willing to grant me the time and trust I needed, which I deeply regret. I feel this was never a relationship based on mutual trust. Throughout my career, every season I have been able to see through to the end as a coach has brought success. Clubs that placed their trust in me have been rewarded with success and silverware.""

Ten Hag will therefore be keen to get back into management as early as possible and put the episode with Leverkusen behind him. And even if Wolves decide against hiring him, he is bound to be linked with more Premier League jobs in the future.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Football icon Cristiano Ronaldo has admitted he does not believe arch-rival Lionel Messi is the greatest of all time in a bombshell interview. The Al-Nassr star sat down with Piers Morgan for a catch-up on his life since moving to Saudi Arabia, and the Portuguese forward revealed he does not see the Argentine great as the best to ever play the game. 

For years, fans have been debating whether Ronaldo or Messi can claim the title of GOAT. Both are now in the twilight of their careers, with the former seeking a title with Al-Nassr in the Middle East, and the latter pursuing glory in Major League Soccer under the watchful eye of David Beckham at Inter Miami. Across the years, both have refrained from speaking negatively about each other as they claimed La Liga titles, Ballon d'Or awards and countless other pieces of silverware, but Ronaldo has now definitively given his answer to the big debate. 

Sitting down on 'Piers Morgan Unsensored', Ronaldo was asked by the presenter whether Messi is the GOAT. His response was simply: ""Messi better than me? I don't agree with that opinion. I don't want to be humble.""

Humble is a word not often associated with Ronaldo, who has been known for his showmanship over the years. And as he continues to tally the goals at Al-Nassr, the Real Madrid and Manchester United legend believes he has proven why he deserves to be recognised as the best. Fans will have to wait for the full answer to the question, with part one of his interview with Morgan set to be releasee on Tuesday, November 4.

As part of the preview, Ronaldo was also quizzed on the comments of his former United team-mate Wayne Rooney. Over 10 years ago, the England icon made it clear that he had a favourite between the ex-Red Devils No.7 and Messi. He said: ""They're two different players. But I think Messi's incredible. I think he's the best ever, so I'd have to say Messi. But Ronaldo has been a bit unlucky because, in any other time, he'd be winning all the awards Messi has. But they're two of the best players of all time.""

It was a surprising moment considering Rooney shared the pitch with Ronaldo, but the 40-year-old was unbothered by the quotes. He simply responded: ""It doesn't pose any problem for me."" Since then, Rooney has gone on to clarify that just because he chose Messi, does not mean he has a bad opinion of Ronaldo. Speaking on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, he clarified: ""People think I hate him! I love him! I think he's an absolute genius; what he's doing is incredible. I don't think people realize how close he and I were. Just because I've said Messi is better than Ronaldo, people think I don't like Cristiano. What he's doing. To be honest, over the last couple of years, I'm thinking, 'Do you know what?', he's probably gonna be the one when you look back, Cristiano, because he keeps going.

""I think these last three seasons he's the top goalscorer in Saudi [Arabia] and whatever. I absolutely love Messi, I love watching him play, and that was the only reason because I think Messi had a little bit more in terms of how he played, and taking players on. Ronaldo's a killer. People think because I've said Messi is better than Ronaldo, that I don't like him or I speak down on him. [I prefer the way Messi plays], that's it - you might prefer Cristiano, this person might prefer Messi or Ronaldo, but I don't think you can argue with any of them two. I just like the little flair about Messi, and that's it.

""Cristiano's an absolute genius in what he's doing; he's just turned 40, and what he's doing is incredible.""

Despite celebrating his 40th birthday in February, Ronaldo has shown no signs of slowing down on the pitch. In 2025-26, he's already bagged nine goals in 10 appearances across all competitions for Al-Nassr. The talisman has made it very clear that he would like to win silverware in Saudi Arabia, something he has so far failed to do since moving from United in 2022. The only other major achievement to pass the global superstar by is the World Cup. While Ronaldo has made it very clear that he is not thinking about retirement yet, he will surely only get one last chance to lift the biggest prize of them all in 2026, perhaps facing Messi one final time. 

For now, though, Ronaldo's focus remains on domestic football. Al-Nassr sit at the top of the Saudi Pro League after seven games, and have a four-point cushion to Al-Taawoun in second. Next up for the five-time Champions League winner is an AFC Cup clash with Goa, on Wednesday evening.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Gary Neville has admitted he is yet to be convinced by one of Manchester United's biggest signings of the summer. The Red Devils were held to a 2-2 by Nottingham Forest on Saturday which interrupted their three-game winning streak in the Premier League. And former United captain Neville took aim at one player in particular, who failed to make the most of starting at the City Ground.

Neville was unimpressed with Benjamin Sesko, who was United's most expensive signing of last summer at £74m ($97m). The Slovenian had three efforts on goal against Forest but couldn't hit the target with any of them. He has only scored twice since his big-money move from RB Leipzig, having been brought in as a supposed upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund, who was sent out on loan to Napoli and is expected to make a permanent move to the Serie A champions as soon as January.

And he contrasted Sesko's struggles with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha's positive starts since joining the club from Brentford and Wolves respectively.

""I'm no further forward with him, the jury's still out,"" Neville said on NBC Sports. ""He's miles off it compared to the other forwards United brought in, like Cunha and Mbeumo. He looks awkward, his touch was off a few times when balls went over the top. For £80m [sic], yes he's young and still settling but you want to see something more.""

Gary Lineker was a little more generous with Sesko than Neville when he analysed United's recruitment over the summer on 'The Rest is Football' podcast. ""One thing I would say is that their recruitment for the first time in some time looks pretty good. Cunha looks a really good player and Mbeumo looks a really good player,"" he said. ""Sesko I think might show something, I think he is promising, so I think it has been better recruitment, but time will tell on that as well.""

Lineker added on United's run of three wins and one draw since losing at Brentford: ""I would say they are slightly better. I think they are moving in the right direction. I still don't think overall they have the players that suit the way Amorim plays.While they have a little bit of a good run, and a revival, it is hard to envisage that they will sustain it for a long period but you have got to remember, where they were last season, 15th in the league or something, you are not going to suddenly jump up to the top."" 

Sesko has a lot of work to do to win round United fans and sceptical pundits such as Neville. Indeed, there was some uncertainty about whether he would be a big upgrade on Hojlund given the fact that he seemed a similar profile of player: a young striker with potential but with only two years of experience in Europe's top five leagues and no track record in the Premier League.

The Slovenian was marginally more experienced than Hojlund, with 27 goals for Leipzig in two seasons in the Bundesliga compared to Hojlund scoring nine times in one season in Serie A. Hojlund waited four months to finally score his first Premier League goal with United, ending his debut campaign with 10 strikes. His second season at Old Trafford was a huge disappointment as he netted only four times in the league although the Dane pointed out that few United players could be happy with their performances last season.

Now that United's overall displays are improving along with their results, Sesko needs to rise to the level of Cunha and Mbeumo and start raising his goal count. United's next fixture away to Tottenham on Saturday is a good opportunity for him to do so as Spurs are low on confidence after losing their last two games to Newcastle and Chelsea, with supporters beginning to show discontent towards coach Thomas Frank.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

 Felix Auger-Aliassime has withdrawn from the Moselle Open in Metz, one of two ATP 250s being played in the final week of the regular season. 

 The Canadian pushed new World No. 1 Jannik Sinner to two tight sets in Sunday's final of the Rolex Paris Masters. The 25-year-old, who rallied from a set down in his first three matches in the French capital, cited a left knee injury for his withdrawal. 



 Auger-Aliassime's withdrawal puts at risk his bid to qualify for the second time for the Nitto ATP Finals, which begins Sunday in Turin. At eighth in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin, the eight-time ATP Tour champion has one hand on the last remaining berth to the season finale. But should ninth-placed Lorenzo Musetti claim the title at this week's other ATP 250 in Athens, the Italian will join countryman Sinner in Turin. 

 Auger-Aliassime is 48-22 on the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. It is just the second time in his career that he has topped 40 wins in a season, second only to the 60 wins he amassed in 2022 when he qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals.

When your name appears next to Carlos Alcaraz in the record books, you are operating at an elite level.


Rafael Jodar has accomplished just that with his Sunday triumph at the Jonathan Fried Men's Pro Challenger. The 19-year-old became the third Spanish teenager to win at least three Challenger titles, joining 24-time tour-level titlist Alcaraz and former No. 9 Nicolas Almagro. Alcaraz and Almagro each claimed four Challenger titles as teenagers. With Jodar just turning 19 in September, he could tie them in the next 10 months.


Jodar's statement triumph came on familiar ground at the University of Virginia, where he is a sophomore. He defeated American Martin Damm 6-3, 7-6(2) in the final, a rematch of last month's championship match at the Lincoln Challenger, also won by Jodar. The #NextGenATP star has earned three Challenger titles in as many months.


Following his victory at the indoor event, Jodar is ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah. The 2024 US Open boys' singles champion is aiming for his maiden trip to the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, where last year he was a sparring partner.

Janice Tjen, a rising tennis star from Indonesia, has made an impressive leap in the WTA rankings, reaching No. 53 after winning her first singles title at the Chennai Open. Her success, aided by coach Christopher Bint, showcases her dedication and perseverance despite challenges. Tjen's inspiring journey serves as a reminder to young players to never lose hope in pursuing their dreams.

Twelve months ago, Janice Tjen was ranked in the 500s in the WTA singles rankings. On Monday, the 23-year-old from Indonesia moved to No. 53 in the world, capping off an incredible year by winning her first WTA Tour singles title at the Chennai Open -- and following it up with her second WTA doubles title in as many weeks just a few hours later.

Tjen's rise has been historic. Her triumph in Chennai makes her the first player from Indonesia to win a WTA singles title in 23 years, and her new ranking of No. 53 is the second highest achieved by any Indonesian player on the professional tour. Only Yayuk Basuki, who peaked at No. 19, has gone higher.

This was Tjen's second appearance in a WTA Tour-level final. She came close to winning the trophy in Sao Paulo in September but fell short against France's Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah. Sunday's win was even sweeter after that loss, which she described as heartbreaking.

“I'm very happy to be able to get the win this time because it was a heartbreaking loss the previous time,” the Indonesian player said. “I got to the final in Sao Paulo WTA 250 but luckily today, I came out on the better end.”

If you are looking to find out the secret to her stunning breakthrough over the past year, there isn't any -- as Tjen pointed out herself after winning the singles title on Sunday.

“I don't think there is any secret,” she said. “I think it's just about putting in the work, trying to improve every aspect of my game, week in and week out. Also trying to learn from the previous losses and from the matches that I win as well.”

Tjen made it only as far as No. 93 in the world junior rankings, and while she honed her skills on the U.S. college circuit, few had earmarked her for this rapid breakthrough on the pro tour. The success has been unexpected even for Tjen, but she isn't paying too much attention to the numbers.

“I would say it's unexpected,"" she said. ""On paper, the rankings do jump out a bit but I don't really think too much about numbers. I just trying to work and see what's going to happen. Me and my coach haven't talked much about rankings and that stuff. We just want to keep improving, what can we do better and from the start of us working together, we said we're not going to talk about rankings until a year after that and we can look back and see where we are.”

Perhaps one of the biggest contributing factors to her rise has been that partnership with coach Christopher Bint.

“I had been struggling to find a coach that connects with me and has the same values,"" Tjen said. ""Somehow, I got to connect with my coach Christopher Bint and it has been really good till now.”

The pair met at the end of last year when Bint was the national performance coach for Tennis New Zealand. They began a trial partnership in April and May before deciding to work together full time. But things haven't been always easy for Tjen and her family, who come from a humble background in Indonesia. The financial challenges of pursuing a professional tennis career led the Tjens to opt for the U.S. college tennis route. Tjen first attended Oregon before moving to Pepperdine to complete her college career.

“Tennis is a very expensive sport where you have to travel and then you have to hire a coach,"" Tjen said. ""All of these expenses add up and it's not easy for me and my family. Luckily there's a college route that helped me to continue to develop my game and put myself in a better position to turn pro.""

Tjen is grateful for finding the right pathway to give her dream of competing at the highest level a chance. And she has a simple message for aspiring young players.

“I think my message would be don't lose hope,"" she said. ""It's like for me, I always try to put myself in the best position to be able to compete to the highest level and never stop believing and hopefully like there will be like a chance, a pathway for other young players to be able to compete like in the highest level as well.”

There are a few shifts within the Top 8 after Paris—Zverev and Djokovic switching spots, Shelton and Fritz switching spots—but the most notable move today comes at the border of the elite, as Felix Auger-Aliassime rises from No. 9 to No. 8 in the race standings after reaching the final in the French capital, bumping Lorenzo Musetti from No. 8 to No. 9.That battle will continue into this week, as Auger-Aliassime and Musetti are the only two players in contention for the final spot in Turin.And the scenario is simple: Musetti needs to win the title in Athens this week to pass Auger-Aliassime's points and return to No. 8 in the race standings, and thus qualify for the ATP Finals in Turin.And that feat could be even tougher given he might have to defeat Djokovic in the final in the Greek capital, if they both make the final.That scenario would have been more complicated as Auger-Aliassime was entered in Metz this week, but he withdrew with a left knee injury.RACE TO THE ATP FINALS, TOP 15 (as of November 3rd, players qualified in bold):No. 1: Carlos Alcaraz—11,050 pointsNo. 2: Jannik Sinner—10,000 pointsNo. 3: Alexander Zverev—4,960 points [+1]No. 4: Novak Djokovic—4,580 points [-1]No. 5: Ben Shelton—3,970 points [+1]No. 6: Taylor Fritz—3,935 points [-1]No. 7: Alex de Minaur—3,935 pointsNo. 8: Felix Auger-Aliassime—3,845 points [+1]No. 9: Lorenzo Musetti—3,685 points [-1]No. 10: Jack Draper—2,990 pointsNo. 11: Alexander Bublik—2,870 points [+4]No. 12: Casper Ruud—2,835 points [-1]No. 13: Daniil Medvedev—2,760 pointsNo. 14 Alejandro Davidovich Fokina—2,635 pointsNo. 15: Holger Rune—2,580 points [-3]

All will be revealed on Friday. But if you just can't wait...

	Paul Grein



	A couple of recent news items from the Recording Academy may give us some hints about what to expect when the Grammy nominations are announced on Friday Nov. 7.


	On Monday (Nov. 3), the academy announced that they have added approximately 2,900 new voting members this year as part of their years-long effort to diversify the voting body. Of the newly-admitted members, 49% are age 39 and under, 60% are people of color and 30% identify as women.


	Also, for the first time, invitations to join the Recording Academy were extended to all voting members of the Latin Recording Academy. Many accepted the offer. That's a strong indicator that Bad Bunny could be headed for his second album of the year nod for Debí Tirar Más Fotos. He was already a likely nominee in that category, especially since Sept. 28, when he was announced as next year's Super Bowl halftime headliner. Now, he seemingly can't miss. The influx of Latin Recording Academy members also puts Karol G, who is entered with Tropicoqueta, in the album of the year conversation.


	Last Thursday, the academy announced the names of the celebrities who will participate in Friday's nominations livestream, including several artists who are vying for nods – Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Brandi Carlile, Doechii, Jon Batiste and the aforementioned Karol G. Just because someone has been invited to announce some nominees on the livestream doesn't automatically mean they're going to be nominated, but if you're looking for every conceivable hint and clue (and we are!), it's a positive sign. Would the academy really ask an A-lister like Carpenter to participate in their livestream if she was shut out in the nominations? (That would be “Manchild” behavior.)


Kendrick Lamar (GNX) and Lady Gaga (MAYHEM) are probably this year's surest bets for album of the year nods. It would be the fifth nomination in the category as lead (or co-lead) artists for both artists. Neither has ever won in the category. If Lamar is nominated, he'll become the first solo artist in Grammy history to receive album of the year nods for five consecutive studio albums.


Elton John and Coldplay could be headed for their fourth nods in the category – John for his collab with Carlile, Who Believes in Angels?; Coldplay for Moon Music. Carlile, Batiste (Big Money) and Justin Bieber (Swag) could be headed for their third nods in the category.


	We could see history made on Friday, if three rap albums are nominated for album of the year. There have never been more than two rap albums nominated in any one year. Lamar's GNX seems a lock for a nomination. Clipse's Let God Sort Em Out and Tyler, the Creator's CHROMAKOPIA also have a good shot.


	Two soundtracks are strong contenders – KPop Demon Hunters, which has been an inescapable pop-culture phenomenon, and Wicked, which stars a major pop star (Ariana Grande) as well as a near-EGOT (Cynthia Erivo). But in the last 30 years, just three soundtracks have been nominated for album of the year – and all three were linked to a top-name producer – Waiting to Exhale (Babyface), O Brother, Where Art Thou? (T Bone Burnett) and Black Panther (Kendrick Lamar).


	Debut or breakthrough albums often make the album of the year finals. Leon Thomas' second album, Mutt, and debut releases by Alex Warren (You'll Be Alright, Kid) and sombr (I Barely Know Her) are contenders this year. Olivia Dean's breakthrough album, The Art of Loving, was released after the end of the eligibility period (Aug. 31, 2024, to Aug. 30, 2025). It will be eligible here next year, though Dean is eligible for best new artist this year, and is among the front-runners in that category.


	Other albums, not already mentioned, that are strong contenders include The Weeknd‘s Hurry Up Tomorrow, Tate McRae's So Close to What, Laufey's A Matter of Time, Bon Iver's SABLE, fABLE, Jelly Roll's Beautifully Broken, HAIM's I Quit, Lorde's Virgin and Kali Uchis' Sincerely.


	Here are the eight albums most likely to be nominated for album of the year. They are listed in alphabetical order by artist, as they will appear on the official Grammy nominations list. We show you how many album of the year nominations the artist has previously received as a lead artist and how high this album placed on the Billboard 200.






Previous album of the year nods: 1


Billboard 200 peak: No. 1 (four weeks)


Notes: Three years ago, Bunny's Un Verano Sin Ti became the first Spanish-language album to receive an album of the year nod. His follow-up album, Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana, wasn't nominated in this category, but his latest may put him back on track, and make him the only artist with two Spanish-language albums nominated in the top category.


Debí Tirar Más Fotos drew stronger reviews and had a more extended chart presence than Nadie Sabe… Also, Bunny's upcoming Super Bowl gig is putting him top-of-mind (and demonstrating a greater American mainstream embrace) right during Grammy voting season. Finally, the racist backlash to Bunny's selection will stir a “backlash to the backlash” among many Grammy voters, who will want to show their support. If Bunny is nominated, he'll become the first artist to be an album of the year contender in the same year that he was a Super Bowl halftime headliner since Justin Timberlake achieved both feats in 2004. JT was up for album of the year with his solo debut, Justified, and co-headlined the Super Bowl show with Janet Jackson (which gave us the phrase “wardrobe malfunction”), P. Diddy, Nelly, Kid Rock and Jessica Simpson. Bunny would be the first sole headliner (not part of a multiartist show) who was nominated for album of the year in the same year that they headlined the Super Bowl show since U2 in 2002, which was up for the top Grammy with All That You Can't Leave Behind.


Debí Tirar Más Fotosis also competing for a nod for best música urbana album, a category in which Bunny has won twice.


Previous album of the year nods: 1


Billboard 200 peak: No. 1 (one week)


Notes: Carpenter was nominated in this category last year for Short n' Sweet. She is vying to become just the third artist in the past decade – following H.E.R. and Taylor Swift – to be nominated in this category in back-to-back years. H.E.R. was nominated with the compilation albums H.E.R. and I Used to Know Her in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Swift was nominated with the studio albums Folklore (which won) and Evermore in 2021 and 2022, respectively.


	More Grammy Trivia: If she's nominated, Carpenter will match the Carpenters (no relation), who had back-to-back album of the year nods in 1971-72.


Man's Best Friend is also competing for a nod for best pop vocal album, an award Carpenter won last year with Short n' Sweet. If she wins again in February, she'll become the first artist to win in the category in back-to-back years.


Previous album of the year nods: 0


Billboard 200 peak: No. 4 (one week)


Notes: The members of Clipse, Pusha T and Malice, were listed alongside the duo's name on the Grammy entry list and will presumably be listed that way on the final ballot as well, should they make it. Pharrell Williams, who has won producer of the year, non-classical three times, produced the set, which is also vying for a best rap album nod.


	This is Clipse's fourth album; its first in nearly 16 years. Clipse's Grammy track record is scant but Let God drew the best first-week numbers of the duo's career and drew considerable praise from media and fans for the strength of its material, all to a degree rarely seen for a veteran rap act. If Let God is nominated, it would honor this particular album, but it would also be something of a lifetime achievement award.


Previous album of the year nods: 3 for John, 2 for Carlile


Billboard 200 peak: No. 9 (one week)


Notes: This would be John's fourth nod in this category, following Elton John (1971), Caribou (1975) and Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy (1976). This would give John a 55-year span of album of the year nominations, a record topped only by Tony Bennett, whose nods spanned 59 years. Andrew Watt, who won producer of the year, non-classical in 2021, produced the album.


	The album is also vying for a nod for best traditional pop vocal album. If it wins, this would be the fourth album category in which Carlile has prevailed. She won best Americana album twice for her albums By the Way, I Forgive You and In These Silent Days, best country album as a producer of Tanya Tucker's While I'm Livin' and best folk album as a producer of Joni Mitchell Live at Newport (Live).


Who Believes in Angels? didn't really have legs commercially – it spent just two weeks on the Billboard 200 – and a CBS TV special based on the album, An Evening With Elton John and Brandi Carlile, received just one Primetime Emmy nomination (in a technical category). But the artists are revered, and the story of their collaboration – a hot current artist teaming with a legend – is compelling.


Previous album of the year nods: 4


Billboard 200 peak: No. 1 (one week)


Notes: This would be Gaga's fifth nomination in this category; her first for a contemporary pop album since Born This Way in 2012. Her other nods are for The Fame (2010), The Fame Monster (2011) and Love for Sale (a collab with Tony Bennettt, 2022).


	Gaga has amassed 14 Grammys, but she has yet to win in a Big Four category – album, record and song of the year plus best new artist. That's rather mind-boggling after all this time. Let's hope that changes.


	Gaga and Bruno Mars memorably performed “California Dreamin'” to boost Los Angeles wildfire relief on the 2025 Grammys. In April, she headlined the first night of Coachella.


Mayhem is also vying for a nod for best pop vocal album, a category in which Gaga won in 2011 with The Fame Monster. If she wins again in February, she'll tie Adele, Kelly Clarkson and Taylor Swift for the most wins in the category.


Previous album of the year nods: 4


Billboard 200 peak: No. 1 (three weeks)


Notes: Lamar is vying to become the first rapper to receive five nominations in this category as a lead artist. He's currently tied with Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, with four album of the year nods. Lamar's nods are for good kid, m.A.A.d. city (2014), To Pimp a Butterfly (2016), DAMN. (2018) and Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers (2023). Lamar was also nominated for the Black Panther soundtrack (2019), but not as a lead artist. He was nominated as a featured artist, producer and songwriter.


	As noted above, he would also become the first solo artist from any genre to be nominated in this category with five consecutive studio albums. Donald Fagen was nominated with five consecutive studio albums, but that combines solo and Steely Dan projects. The impressive run began with Steely Dan's Aja and Gaucho, continued with Fagen's first two solo albums, The Nightfly and Kamakiriad and culminated with Steely Dan's album Two Against Nature, which won.


GNX also vying for a nod for best rap album, a category in which Lamar has won three times. If he wins in February for a fourth time, he'll tie Ye as the runner-up to all-time category champ Eminem (six wins).


Previous album of the year nods: 0


Billboard 200 peak: No. 1 (three weeks)


Notes: The rapper was nominated in this category 13 years ago as a featured artist on Frank Ocean's debut studio album, Channel Orange, but this would be his first nod in the category as a lead artist.


CHROMAKOPIA has ridden a slowly-cresting wave for Tyler, the Creator as with each release he posts better numbers while moving away from the shock-rap of his early material, consistently proving himself one of the most exciting and thoughtful artists in popular music, and one now celebrated both by critics and streaming audiences. 


	The LP, which set a personal best for Tyler, the Creator for most weeks atop the Billboard 200, is also vying for a nod as best rap album. Tyler has won twice in the category for Igor and Call Me If You Get Lost. It's hard to imagine him beating Lamar in that category, but if he does, they'll be tied with three wins each.


Previous album of the year nods: 1


Billboard 200 peak: No. 1 (one week)


Notes: The crossover star was nominated for album of the year 10 years ago with Beauty Behind the Madness, but was passed over in this category with his next three studio albums – Starboy, After Hours and Dawn FM. When he wasn't nominated in any categories at the 2021 ceremony for his megahit “Blinding Lights,” he announced a Grammy boycott. He made a surprise, bury-the-hatchet appearance on the Grammys in February, where he performed two songs from his just-released album Hurry Up Tomorrow, “Cry for Me” and “Timeless.” Will Grammy voters extend the rapprochement with a nod here?


Hurry Up Tomorrow is also vying for a nod for best pop vocal album. It would be The Weeknd's first win in that category. He won twice for best urban contemporary album for Beauty Behind the Madness and Starboy.

Benson Boone was forced to pull the plug on his show at Utilita Arena in Birmingham, England on Saturday (Nov. 1) at the last minute due to vocal issues. According to a BBC report, in a since-expired statement posted to his Instagram Story, Boone apologized to fans for the missed date, saying his throat condition necessitated the call-off.

	“Birmingham I am so so sorry but I will not be able to perform tonight,” Boone wrote in the since expired message. “I have tried everything I can to revive my voice, but I cannot give you the show I'd like to be able to give you with the condition of my throat right now. This is genuinely the crappiest feeling, I am so sorry. I promise you I will do everything in my power to make it up to you.”

	Boone promised that he will update fans on a rescheduled date as soon as possible. 


	The BBC reported that the arena also confirmed the cancellation, saying it was “working through all possible options to reschedule… We understand how disappointing this is and sincerely apologize for the extremely short notice and inconvenience caused.” 




	At press time a spokesperson for Boone had not returned Billboard‘s request for comment on the cancelled show or and no information was available on whether Boone will be back in fighting shape for his upcoming three-night run at the O2 Arena in London, which is slated to kick off on Monday night (Nov. 3). Editor's note: Several hours after this story posted, Boone took to his Instagram Story with a post that featured a pic of his legs stretched out on stage and the caption “It's on London,” with a note that additional seats had been released for tonights's show.


	Boone is slated to be on the road in Europe in support of his second studio album, American Heart, through a Nov. 18 show at Avicii Arena in Stockholm, Sweden and will round out his year of touring with a Dec. 4 slot at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in the United Arab Emirates.


	Boone is also booked to play one of the most exciting shows of his career on Nov. 29 when he is lined up to play as part of Visa Live at the Rocket Garden, a one-night-only special event at the Rocket Garden at Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Fla., which will be livestreamed to fans around the world on TikTok.

Kehlani's ""Folded"" flies 14-7, following the release of new remixes.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” notches a fourth week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, encompassing its entire run on the chart so far.


	Helping the song's continued Hot 100 command, Swift released its “Alone in My Tower Acoustic Version” for digital purchase Oct. 28, just after 4:30 p.m. ET, ahead of the tracking week's close at the end of Oct. 30. (A CD single of the new mix, along with its instrumental, and a CD single of the song's original version and its instrumental went up for pre-order in Swift's webstore from late Oct. 30 through the afternoon of Oct. 31; those CD sales will impact charts once singles are shipped.)


	Meanwhile, after first appearing on the Hot 100 in 2016, Kehlani achieves her first top 10 on the chart, as “Folded” surges seven spots to No. 7, aided by high-profile remixes released Oct. 24.


	Check out the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Nov. 8, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Nov. 4. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.








	“The Fate of Ophelia” drew 29.1 million official streams (down 13%) and 54.5 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 10%) and sold 22,000 (up 236%) in the United States Oct. 24-30.


	The single scores a fourth week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart and a third week atop Digital Song Sales and is steady at its No. 5 high on Radio Songs.


	“The Fate of Ophelia” became Swift's 13th career Hot 100 No. 1, tying her for the fourth-most in the chart's archives.


	Swift now solely has the eighth-most weeks spent atop the Hot 100, as “The Fate of Ophelia” ups her count to a milestone 40, breaking her out of a tie with Bruno Mars:




	(Beyoncé's total above does not include her 17 weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100 as a member of Destiny's Child, while Jackson's doesn't include his 10 weeks on top as part of the Jackson 5.)


	Swift also ties for the fifth-most Hot 100 No. 1s that have dominated for four or more weeks, as “The Fate of Ophelia” becomes her fifth. Here's a look at the artists with the most such long-leading hits (with their overall No. 1 totals in parentheses):




	Swift's five Hot 100 No. 1s that have led for at least four weeks each: “Anti-Hero” (eight, beginning Nov. 5, 2022); “Blank Space” (seven, Nov. 29, 2014); “The Fate of Ophelia” (four, Oct. 18, 2025); “Cruel Summer” (four, Oct. 28, 2023); and “Shake It Off” (four, Sept. 6, 2014).


	As previously reported, “The Fate of Ophelia” parent album The Life of a Showgirl adds a fourth week atop the Billboard 200 chart, following its modern-era-record debut with 4.002 million equivalent album units three weeks earlier.


	Swift's concurrent command over Billboard's premier album and song charts hits more historic heights. Of the 16 instances of acts launching atop the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 simultaneously, The Life of a Showgirl and “The Fate of Ophelia” make for the first occurrence of an artist doing so and both titles maintaining their respective reigns for their first four weeks.


	Swift stacks three songs in the top 10 of the latest Hot 100, all from The Life of a Showgirl, following her four top 10s a week ago, eight the week before that and all 10 songs in the region in their debut week:




	Kehlani collects her first Hot 100 top 10 as “Folded” bounds 14-7, with 13 million streams (up 35%), 32.9 million in airplay audience (up 11%) and 3,000 sold (up 74%) in the tracking week. It also becomes Kehlani's first top 10 on Streaming Songs (28-10) and Radio Songs (11-8).


	Helping propel “Folded,” six remixes were released Oct. 24 as an “Homage Pack,” one each with Toni Braxton, Brandy, JoJo, Mario, Ne-Yo and Tank. (All versions except for the one with Tank contribute to the song's singular chart listing; that mix does not due to Kehlani's vocals being much more minimized than on the others. Meanwhile, Kehlani remains the only artist credited on the song on the Hot 100, as none of its remixes outperformed the original in consumption for the week.)


	The Oakland, Calif., native has charted 18 Hot 100 entries, including two top 40 hits in addition to “Folded,” both via featured turns on Cardi B songs: “Safe” (No. 26 debut and peak, October) and “Ring” (No. 28 debut and peak, 2018). Kehlani first reached the chart with “Gangsta” in August 2016 and is proof that persistence pays off, as her wait of nine years, two months and two weeks between first appearing on the chart and first hitting the top 10 marks the longest such journey since Kacey Musgraves took 10 years, eight months and two weeks from “Merry Go Round” in 2012 through Zach Bryan's “I Remember Everything,” on which she's featured, in 2023.


	“Folded” also becomes Kehlani's first No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot R&B Songs, rising a spot on each multimetric chart.


Billboard recently asked Kehlani about what she would say to the version of the singer-songwriter a decade ago. Among other advice: “Lock in, focus on your relationship with God and perfect your craft. Take your time and have fun.”


	HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters, is steady at No. 2 on the Hot 100, following eight weeks at No. 1 beginning in August.


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary,” which led the Hot 100 for 10 weeks starting in May, keeps at No. 3, while topping Radio Songs for a landmark 20th week (78.5 million in audience, down 1%). Only two other songs have reached 20 or weeks atop the airplay tally: Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” (27, beginning in August 2024) and The Weeknd's “Blinding Lights” (26, starting in April 2020).


	Olivia Dean's first Hot 100 entry, “Man I Need,” becomes her first top five hit, climbing 8-5, and Justin Bieber's “Daisies” pushes 7-6, after reaching No. 2.


	Morgan Wallen's “I Got Better” holds at No. 9 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. 7, as it leads the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart for a fourth week, and Leon Thomas' “Mutt” sits at its No. 10 Hot 100 high.

	Newcomer Mae Schenk and Ryan Reynolds are set to star in a live-action adaptation of Eloise with Netflix recently boarding the project to distribute. Amy Sherman-Palladino is directing from a script she co-wrote with Hannah Marks and Linda Woolverton. Reynolds will produce through his Maximum Effort banner along with George Dewey, Ashley Fox and Johnny Pariseau. Woolverton will also produce with Molly Milstein exec producing for Maximum Effort.


	The live-action family film's logline is currently under wraps, but will be a wholly original adventure based on the beloved children's book series written by Kay Thompson and illustrated by Hilary Knight. Schenk will play the titular character with Reynolds playing new original villain.

	“Eloise has been beloved for generations, from when she was first published in the 1950s through to today, when no family trip to New York City is complete without a stop at The Plaza,” said Hannah Minghella, Netflix's Head of Feature Animation and Family Film. “It's an honor to reintroduce this cherished character to the world with two people who share her signature mischief and charm—Amy Sherman-Palladino and Ryan Reynolds—in this bold, hilarious, and heartfelt new family film.”

	Independent film and TV studio, MRC, acquired the rights to Eloise in 2019 and is overseeing production of the movie.  Handmade Films will work in conjunction with MRC on the production of the picture.


	“We've been working with the Thompson Estate and Handmade Films for a long time to bring Eloise to fans everywhere, and we're thrilled to be partnering with Maximum Effort, Amy and Netflix to bring the cherished children's property to audiences around the world,” said Jonathan Golfman and Brye Adler, Co-Presidents, MRC Film.

	











	The film had been set up at Paramount, but following the recent Skydance merger, the previous Paramount regime had been certain films could find new homes once the merger was signed without having to worry about ending up in development purgatory. Once the project hit the market, Netflix moved fast to reunite with Reynolds and Maximum Effort after working on past films like Red Notice.


	“When Amy introduced us to Mae Schenk, we knew instantly she was Eloise,” said Ashley Fox & Johnny Pariseau, Co-Presidents of Production, Maximum Effort. “She's got the spark, the wit, and just the right amount of mischief. We're so excited to introduce her to the world with our friends at MRC and Netflix.”


	MRC will collaborate with the Thompson estate, illustrator Knight, as well as Simon & Schuster, the book series' publisher, on the film. Principal photography is set to start in November.


	Reynolds is repped by WME and Sherman-Palladino is repped by CAA. Schenk is repped by Paradigm and Goodman Genow.

Senior International Film Correspondent


EXCLUSIVE: Krysten Ritter (Jessica Jones), Cameron Crovetti (The Boy), Sarah Bolger (Mayans M.C.) and Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix) are set to star in creature horror thriller Claire.


	Producers Matthew R. Cooper and Anna Dragoo of Objectively Good Media (OGM), along with Sterling Beaumon and Thomas Mahoney, announced the upcoming horror feature on Monday ahead of an AFM sales launch.


	Written by John Carlos Higgins, the feature explores the intersection of addiction and the supernatural in modern-day rural New Mexico with elements of The Babadook, The Relic and Hereditary.


	Tracy Kleeman, whose short film Fear Filter was a viral hit, generating 10 million views, makes her feature directorial debut on the film. The director is also a former longtime assistant to mentor James Wan (The Conjuring, Malignant), while her other short works include Housekeeping and Beneath the Skin.

	Ritter plays Claire, a struggling single mother battling addiction, as a malevolent creature that feeds on despair begins to terrorize her and her two sons. As her fight for sobriety deepens, the line between inner demons and real monsters, blurs, culminating in a harrowing battle for survival and redemption. 


	The project is executive produced by Julie Kroll, Lior Haas, Lisa Wolofsky and Edoardo Bussi of Twenty-Nine Palms Entertainment, who is overseeing global sales and will be presenting the title to distributors at the AFM.


	“As a staunch advocate for addiction and recovery stories, Claire brilliantly balances its creature feature/ horror elements with the frustrating realities of living with an active addict. I couldn't be prouder of Tracy, Krysten, Sarah, John and the entire team for shepherding this project to fruition” says producer Matthew R. Cooper (Damned If You Do, Honk for Jesus, Tankhouse).

	











	Bussi, who launched London-based international sales and production company earlier this year, will be leading sales discussions at the AFM.


	“At Twenty-Nine Palms, our mission is to champion bold, visionary stories that transcend genre while maintaining commercial appeal,” he said.


	“Claire is exactly that, an emotionally charged, terrifyingly original horror film that invites audiences everywhere to confront what haunts us most. We're thrilled to bring this project to international distributors looking for a powerful and market-ready new title.”


	Kleeman is represented by CAA and Redshift Management; Ritter by CAA, Industry Entertainment, Principal LA and Brecheen Feldman; Crovetti by Osbrink Talent Agency, Industry Entertainment as well as  Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher; Sarah Bolger by Mosaic, IAG, Accelerate, Rick Genow at Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher, and Carrie-Anne Moss by Elizabeth Hodgson,  Hodgson Management Group, Robert Lange at Kleinberg, Lange, Cuddy & Carlo, Jennifer Allen at Viewpoint.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Pregnant Cardi B wears head-to-toe Bottega leather to cheer on boyfriend Stefon Diggs at her first Patriots game","https://pagesix.com/2025/11/03/style/pregnant-cardi-b-wears-head-to-toe-bottega-veneta-leather-to-cheer-on-boyfriend-stefon-diggs-at-her-first-patriots-game-at-gillette-stadium/","Mon, 03 Nov 2025 17:14:00 GMT","

Cardi B has made her football WAG debut, pulling out all the stops on Sunday night to cheer on boyfriend Stefon Diggs at Gillette Stadium.

For her first-ever game, the pregnant singer chose head-to-toe Bottega Veneta.

She was spotted in the VIP box wearing a burgundy leather coat and matching gloves, the color of the season. The entire outfit was crafted of the design house's signature woven leather pattern.

Underneath, Cardi wore a coordinated burgundy jumpsuit and thigh-high woven leather boots that matched her colorful coat and gloves.

And, as a final touch, she carried an exotic Hermès Birkin in burgundy.

Cardi seems to have hard-launched her field-side outing as a good luck charm. Not only did the Patriots beat the Atlanta Falcons 24-23, but Diggs also caught an 11-yard touchdown pass that had his girlfriend up out of her seat, hands in the air.

In a post-game interview, Diggs shared that Cardi might have been late to the game, adding, “I've gotta do my homework … I've gotta watch the tape on that one,” and, when questioned about whether he taught her the touchdown celebration, he joked, “she picked it up on her own … her dance moves are a little shaky, though.”

Taking to X after the game, she celebrated by writing, “BIG PAAATTTTSSSS!!!! BIG TD FROM 8!!!!! …You from Boston let's have a little tea partyyyyyy GRRRR.”

Though not specifically Patriots red, the 33-year-old certainly came dressed as the festive supporter in burgundy, taking a cue from fellow football girlfriend (turned fiancée) Taylor Swift, who also turns it up in team colors when supporting her man on the field.

He's so happy, baby.

Ashanti threw a private, star-studded 51st birthday party for her husband, Nelly, at the hot spot Lo Kee Atlanta on Saturday.

A source exclusively tells Page Six that the “Foolish” singer, 45, rented out a private room for the “Dilemma” emcee to celebrate his big day.

The bash was attended by 50 of Nelly and Ashanti's closest friends and family, including rapper Bow Wow and producer Jermaine Dupri, we're told.

The couple, who secretly tied the knot in December 2023, arrived at the modern Asian fusion restaurant around 10:30 p.m. ET and stayed until 1:30 a.m. ET. 

The “Baby” songstress and the “Hot In Herre” rapper, born Cornell Iral Haynes Jr., dined on Beijing chicken, chicken satay, rock shrimp tempura and salt and pepper prawns.

They also enjoyed a birthday cake and other desserts.

After Ashanti serenaded her beau with a sweet rendition of “Happy Birthday,” everyone watched the Los Angeles Dodgers defeat the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 7 of the World Series together.

In 2023, Nelly and Ashanti reignited romance rumors by holding hands together, nearly 10 years after they broke up for good.

That September, the “Air Force Ones” emcee confirmed that they were back together, saying that they were “cool again.”

“I think it surprised both of us, though. It wasn't anything that I don't think was planned,” he said in an interview with “Love and Hip Hop” stars Rasheeda and Kirk Frost.

Nelly said he believed the years he and Ashanti spent apart contributed to them finding their way back to each other.

Three months later, news broke that the “John Tucker Must Die” actress was pregnant and expecting her first child with Nelly. (Nelly is also a father to daughter Chanelle, 31, and son Cornell Haynes III, 26, with ex Channetta Valentine.)

In June 2024, Page Six obtained the pair's marriage license, stating that they were secretly married for six months and said “I do” in Nelly's hometown, St. Louis, Mo.

Ashanti gave birth to their son, Kareem Kenkaide Hayes, in July 2024.

In an exclusive interview with Page Six, Ashanti's Murder Inc. collaborator Ja Rule gushed over how “great” the singer was at motherhood.

“She's been manifesting this moment for a long time, so now it's finally here,” the “Always On Time” rapper, 49, told us in January.

“The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” OG, Kyle Richards, recently gave fans a peek under the brim of her next business venture, and let's just say it's a perfect fit. 

During her last Amazon Live stream, in between showcasing her newest favorite clothing accessories and home goods, Kyle told viewers that she's moving closer to launching a hat line. To the point that she even opted for a front-row seat to learn the full design process, pick out material, and understand the art of millinery.

And for those who've been watching “RHOBH” since the beginning, this hardly comes as a surprise.  

While in Aspen during season 12 of “RHOBH,” Kyle took the girls to Kemo Sabe, a mecca of high-end western wear. According to Kyle, when it comes to her friends, a visit to Kemo Sabe is a “rite of passage.”

After buying a hat, which ranges from $350 to $1,595, shoppers can then customize it with their initials or even opt to distress it by lighting it on fire. Naturally, after dropping that much cash on their new purchase, the idea of setting it on fire is a bit scary. But, hey, it's all in the name of fashion!

Kyle's love of hats can actually be traced back to her own mother, who had a similar affinity for headwear. And because of that fashionable trait, this mom of four has rocked pretty much every hat imaginable during her long-running tenure on “RHOBH.” But it's the classic cowboy style that won her heart.

But wearing a cowboy hat on her head wasn't enough for Kyle. So, in 2024, she added to her growing tattoo collection by getting a cowboy hat tattoo! Luckily, a tattoo goes with any outfit, because this is one accessory she can never take off.

Kyle's been a “RHOBH” mainstay for 15 years, and it certainly makes sense for her to have an eye towards the future. Her youngest daughter, Portia Umansky, will be off to college soon, and then she'll be a true empty nester with a lot of hours to fill. And while she has a lengthy background in front of the camera, her latest venture may very well find her wading into the wild world of textiles.

The classic narrative structure of “One Thousand and One Nights,” which saw a woman who marries a prince with a penchant for killing his brides extend her own life via a series of riveting stories, gets a modern feminist update this holiday season in the form of Julia Jackman's “100 Nights of Hero.” 

Adapted from Isabel Greenberg's 2016 graphic novel, the film follows a maid who attempts to protect a young bride from a dreadful fate by telling her a series of stories. Emma Corrin stars as the titular storyteller alongside Maika Monroe, with Nicholas Galitzine, Amir El-Masry, Charli XCX, Richard E. Grant, and Felicity Jones rounding out the rest of the supporting cast.

“100 Nights of Hero” premiered at the 2025 Venice International Film Festival, where it earned overwhelming praise for its sharp pop sensibilities and writer/director Julia Jackman's ability to update a classic storytelling format for more contemporary sensibilities. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






“What makes the work remarkable is its sincerity,” Leila Latif wrote in her IndieWire review. “In a cinematic landscape increasingly dominated by algorithm-driven sameness, this film stands out for its defiant originality. It revels in its singularity and empathy, in the radical power of storytelling: to distract tyrants, to empower the silenced, to imagine new futures. The act of telling a story becomes, in itself, an act of survival and resistance. That message, articulated through Cherry and Hero's connection, resonates far beyond the screen. By the end, one feels not just entertained, but invigorated. Jackman's film is a joyous testament to independence, creativity, and the enduring necessity of stories. It proves that happy endings need not conform to centuries-old formulas, and that love, be it romantic, platonic, queer, or fleeting, can be as complex and wondrous as any of the tales we tell.”

 










She continued, “This is a film of rare joy and spirit, and one that deserves to be celebrated as both a feminist fairytale and a manifesto that will inspire a myriad of future stories.”

An Independent Film Company release, “100 Nights of Hero” opens in theaters on Friday, December 5. Watch the official trailer below.

Daniel Lopatin will release his upcoming Oneohtrix Point Never album, Tranquilizer, later this month, and, today, he's previewing the LP with a new song. “Cherry Blue” comes with a music video by Pol Taburet, marking the French artist's first-ever foray into the medium. The painter incorporates surreal imagery in the short film to signify the gaps between life and death, body and spirit, and decay and renewal. Check it out below.

Tranquilizer is out digitally on November 17 and physically on November 21 via Warp. “Cherry Blue” is the fifth preview of the album, following “For Residue,” “Bumpy,” “Lifeworld,” and “Measuring Ruins.” The follow-up to 2023's Oneohtrix Point Never album Again was “shaped by commercial audio construction kits from a bygone era—an index of cliches turned inside out,” according to Lopatin.

Beyond his Oneohtrix Point Never moniker, Lopatin also scored the new Josh Safdie film Marty Supreme, starring Timothée Chalamet, Gwyneth Paltrow, Tyler, the Creator, and Abel Ferrara. That movie screens in U.S. theaters starting on December 25. He previously worked with the Safdie Brothers on their movies Good Time, for which Lopatin won the Soundtrack Award at Cannes Film Festival, and Uncut Gems.

							By 

	Alan Sepinwall



	“I'm kind of a glass-half-empty guy,” says Vince Gilligan, creator of the legendary Breaking Bad, co-creator of Better Call Saul, and legendarily nice guy. “When I do interviews or when I'm in the writers room, I'm trying to be [nice], because it's nice seeing people smile. But my real self is as much the negative stuff.”


	That “negative stuff” comes through in spades in Gilligan's new series, Pluribus, his first since the stories of Walter White and Saul Goodman ended three years ago. It is set in an entirely new world and built around a character, Carol, whom Apple TV+ describes as “the most miserable person on Earth.”


	“I'm not unlike Carol, really,” Gilligan continues. “The sarcasm and the negativity and the general miserableness — that's the easy part for me, honestly.”


	That glass-half-empty approach might explain why it's taken almost two decades for Gilligan to make something not set in what fans have taken to calling the Heisenberg universe of Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, Saul Goodman and Co. Most producers in his position would have used the clout from Breaking Bad's success to make a dream project. But to Gilligan, who launched that series after a fallow career stretch following the end of The X-Files, where he first learned to write and direct for television, the phenomenon it became felt more than a little fluky. “I was nervous about leaving the Heisenberg universe,” he admits.   

	











	“Some people who read my biography are going to say ‘Well, this guy got real lucky real early.' And that's true,” Gilligan says. “But there's some years in the wilderness where it was like, ‘I'm never going to get to where I want to be.' And suddenly, Breaking Bad happens, and it turns into this thing that was beyond any of our wildest expectations. It still blows my mind. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“And that's not false modesty or aw-shucks, gee-whiz performative whatever,” he insists. “I honestly feel that way. I don't know what we did right to make it go off like a skyrocket. It was just the right actors, the right place, at the right time. If Breaking Bad had been the exact same show, but it had come out 10 years sooner or 10 years later, maybe no one would be talking about it. Timing is luck, and luck is timing.”

					The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time		
	









	But now, Gilligan has finally cashed in the blank check to which he's been long entitled. And boy, has he. Pluribus has a reported budget of $15 million per episode, five times more than what the average Breaking Bad cost. That's not quite as high as shows like House of the Dragon and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, but those are based on proven IP, at a moment when the industry seems afraid to spend big on anything but brand names. Pluribus, on the other hand, is a wholly original concept — one so strange and specific, I'm barely allowed to say anything about it, save that, as Apple TV+ describes it, the aforementioned most miserable person on Earth “must save the world from happiness.” Our cranky heroine is played by Saul alum Rhea Seehorn, beloved by fans of the spin-off but far from a household name. Without a big star, without a familiar title, and with a premise that Gilligan wanted kept under wraps until the Nov. 7 premiere, Apple TV+ is gambling a lot of money that merely saying they have a new series from the creator of Breaking Bad will be enough to draw people in. 


	“When you put it that way, you kind of scared me,” says Gilligan. 


	He shouldn't be scared. Pluribus is a dazzling piece of entertainment. It takes advantage of everything Gilligan learned about patient storytelling with Breaking Bad and Saul, then combines it with the high-concept ambition of X-Files, as well as the visual flair Gilligan has developed as a director on all his shows. Though the plot involves every person on the planet, the focus is often entirely on Carol, as Gilligan relies on all the things he realized Seehorn could do — tragedy, slapstick, and sheer screen presence — during her time playing attorney Kim Wexler on Saul. There are long stretches where we're just watching Carol struggle through various tasks, like digging a grave. And it's riveting.

	The sprawling premise gave Gilligan his first opportunity to film outside of North America, including stops in northern Spain and the Canary Islands. But Carol, like Walt and Kim before her, makes her home in Albuquerque. That's not Gilligan hedging his bets. Rather, it's him being happy with the house he and wife Holly Rice bought in New Mexico during the Heisenberg years, plus a desire to keep working with a local production crew with whom he's developed a near-telepathic bond over nearly two decades.

	While Gilligan is experimenting with a new sci-fi concept in Pluribus, he's in an industry where an older trope of the genre — the robots coming for us — has somehow become a depressing reality. “If you really want to wake me in a cold sweat at three in the morning, AI is the stick to poke me with,” he says. “But then some deeper part of me says, ‘Human beings are always going to want stories created by other human beings. They are not going to want stories scraped by Sam Altman and his guys from the artistry and hard work of literally thousands of years of writing and painting and music, regurgitating it into something ‘new.' ”


	Hollywood's obsession with IP — and the impossibility of anyone without Gilligan's track record being allowed to make something this big that's not based on a comic book or video game — feels like its own existential threat to him. “Star Wars is great. Marvel Comics is great,” he says. “I'm a giant fan of Star Trek. But at a certain point, new generations coming up need their own Star Wars. When the business gets to the point that that's all that's being made and there's no room anymore for original ideas, that's like the death of a civilization. Am I lucky that I get to do something original? I am. And it makes me sad that it's that unusual.”

Vice President JD Vance has joined the list of high-ranking government officials wanting answers about UFOs and extraterrestrials.

In an interview released Wednesday, the vice president doubled down on his promise to 'get to the bottom of' the existence of alien life.

Vance happily declared himself a 'UFO lunatic' and was committed to taking some time during his term in office to examine the evidence he has access to regarding life from other planets.

His comments came nearly three months after he told the hosts of the Ruthless Podcast that he was 'obsessed with the whole UFO thing.'

At the time, Vance said he planned to use the time off during the August recess in Congress to do a 'deep dive' into the government's files on what the military now calls unidentified anomalous phenomenon (UAPs).

However, the vice president has amended his timeline for getting to the bottom of the alien mystery, telling Miranda Devine that it's going to take some time, but he intends to learn if UFOs are real before the next election.

'This is the crazy person inside of me. All of us put the tinfoil hat on from time to time. I can't allow myself to become so busy that I spend the next three years and I don't get to the bottom of this,' Vance said.

The vice president added that he wasn't the only member of the Trump Administration seeking answers about UFOs, noting that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard want to know as well.

'Marco's actually very interested in this, too. We talked about this a little. We talked about this back in our Senate days. So, yeah, there's certainly an interest there,' Vance said during the Pod Force One podcast.

However, the vice president added that what he might view as an angel or demon might be interpreted as an extraterrestrial by others.

Vance said he firmly believed that there were phenomena that humans simply can't explain, but was more open to other possibilities, such as a divine presence.

The vice president, who was raised an evangelical Christian and converted to Catholicism in 2019, explained that he believed in spiritual forces working in the physical world, which could be mistaken for alien encounters.

'Is it aliens or is it our guardian angel, or is it aliens or is it a not-so-guardian force that doesn't care about us, or in fact actively wishes us harm? I don't know the answer to that question,' Vance admitted.

Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna has echoed some of the vice president's beliefs, tying biblical events to more recent reports of extraterrestrial sightings.

Luna, who serves as the chairwoman for the House Oversight Committee on UFO disclosure, said that many witnesses have described what they saw as 'interdimensional' beings that had similarities to angels in the Bible.

'Then you look into texts that were removed from the Bible, like the book of Enoch, that actually specifically address technologies that were given to mankind or of entities not of human origin,' Luna said on the PBD podcast last week.

In August, Gabbard declared on Pod Force One that she did believe in the existence of both UFOs and extraterrestrials, but noted that her role in the intelligence community prevented her from saying anything else.

'We're continuing to look for the truth, uh, and share that truth with the American people,' the intelligence chief said.

However, Gabbard did add that she still had questions regarding the mysterious UFO swarms that invaded the US East Coast in 2024 and was not convinced they were harmless drones.

Despite the growing belief in extraterrestrial life, no verifiable physical evidence, such as artifacts or clear footage of these craft, has been publicly presented to confirm the existence of aliens.

Skeptics have argued that the reliance on anecdotal reports from military personnel and civilians and the lack of peer-reviewed scientific data cast significant doubt on the claims made during recent congressional hearings on UAPs.

However, a new documentary featuring both Luna and Rubio is set to be released in late November, which alleges that the US government has withheld information regarding UFOs and extraterrestrials from both the public and the White House.

'Even presidents have been operating on a need-to-know basis, but that begins to ramp out of control,' Rubio claimed in the film The Age of Disclosure. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

A new study is pointing a spooky, bony finger to Texas as one of the spookiest states in the country.

Being the season of ghouls, witches and skeletons, the team at Hard Rock Bet, an online sportsbook and casino app, conducted a study on all 50 states, looking at four frightening factors — haunted locations, ghost towns, UFO sightings, and average haunted house rating.

Texas came in second after California. California has 136 haunted locations and a staggering 16,969 UFO sightings. Florida came in third, with 120 haunted locations and with 8,757 UFO sightings.

Here is why Texas came in second and where you can find more spooky details.

EU officials reportedly fear that a refusal by the IMF to further back Ukraine could trigger a “cascading loss of confidence in the country's economic viability,” Politico has reported, citing sources in the bloc.

The EU could have to provide Russian sovereign funds frozen in Belgium as collateral in order to secure continued IMF loans for Kiev, but that plan faces significant resistance from Belgium, where the funds are held, the outlet reported on Monday. 

Ukraine, which relies heavily on Western aid, has been struggling to secure a new IMF funding package as its $15.5 billion program expires in 2027. Kiev requested an additional $8 billion last month, but talks have reportedly stalled over doubts about its economic viability.

The EU, Ukraine's main sponsor, last month failed to approve a €140 billion ($160 billion) “reparations loan” backed by frozen Russian assets after Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever opposed it, calling it “sort-of-confiscation” and warning it exposes Belgium to major legal and financial risks without shared liability from other EU states.

Sources told Politico that the IMF may not grant further funding to Ukraine, vital for its war effort amid a deep budget shortfall, unless the EU approves the new loan.

They explained that the “reparations loan” would reassure the IMF of Ukraine's fiscal resilience – a key condition for any funding. Though relatively small, the IMF program's approval would in turn signal to investors that Ukraine remains solvent, they added.

Western nations froze about $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets in 2022, including €200 billion ($209 billion) held at the Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear. The G7 last year backed using interest from those funds to secure $50 billion in loans for Ukraine.

This year, EU finance ministers proposed a similar “reparations loan,” to be repaid if Kiev receives compensation from Moscow after the conflict ends. Following Belgium's refusal to support the plan – and amid wider concerns over legal and fiscal risks – reports claimed EU states could instead issue joint bonds to aid Kiev or cut funding for Ukraine entirely. A final decision is expected at the European Commission summit in December.

Moscow has condemned Western plans to redirect its frozen funds as outright “theft,” warning that the move would undermine trust in Western financial systems. It has also maintained that Western aid to Kiev only prolongs the conflict without affecting its outcome.

Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House of Representatives, is expected to announce her retirement, according to reports.

Mrs Pelosi, who was first elected to Congress during Ronald Reagan's presidency, remains hugely influential in the Democratic Party.

The 85-year-old has remained tight-lipped about her political future, but many in the party believe she is about to bring her five-decade career to a close.

“I wish she would stay for 10 more years,” a California Democrat in the House told NBC, but added: “I think she's out.”

Referring to Tuesday's vote on redistricting California, which could net the Democrats an additional five seats in the 2026 midterms, the Democrat continued: “She's going to go out with Prop 50 overwhelmingly passing, and what a crowning achievement for her to do that.”

A House Democratic leadership aide said of Mrs Pelosi: “I think she's preparing to exit the stage.”

The individual added that the Party “will not fully appreciate the time we have spent with her” until she's gone.

“Most people think it is highly unlikely that she will run for another term,” a Democrat official in California said.

Mrs Pelosi reportedly suggested recently she might not be on the House floor to watch Hakeem Jeffries, currently the Democrat leader in the chamber, sworn in as the first black speaker after next year's mid-terms.

She also does not appear to be campaigning against two Democrats who have entered the primary in her district, San Francisco.

If Mrs Pelosi does indeed draw an end to her political career, it will mark an end of an era in Congress in which she kept an iron grip on her caucus.

As speaker during Barack Obama's administration, she is credited with marshalling votes to pass landmark legislation such as the Affordable Care Act, along with massive spending projects during Joe Biden's single term.

She emerged as a major opponent of Donald Trump in his first term, during which time the House twice voted to impeach the Republican.

After she lost her speaker's gavel in 2024, Mrs Pelosi was widely seen to have drawn on her deep base of supporters to pile pressure on Mr Biden to end his faltering re-election campaign.

The former president is reported to have a grudging respect for Mrs Pelosi despite her “ruthless” decision to move against him, a Biden White House official told Politico last year.

Ian Krager, a spokesman for Mrs Pelosi, declined to say whether she will seek re-election to a 20th full term in Congress.“Speaker Pelosi is fully focused on her mission to win the Yes on 50 special election in California on Tuesday,” he told NBC. “She urges all Californians to join in that mission on the path to taking back the House for Democrats.”

Sports fans frustrated by the standoff between Disney and YouTube TV are sounding off on top ESPN personalities, and the network itself.

Disney's networks, including the ESPN channels, are unavailable on YouTube TV as part of a blackout that began on October 30. The media giant has said YouTube TV isn't willing to pay the market rate.

Meanwhile, the Google-owned live TV service has said that Disney's proposal would force it to raise prices again, while helping Disney-controlled rivals like Fubo and Hulu + Live TV. YouTube TV promised to give its customers a $20 credit if the blackout drags on.

The dispute comes as live sports rights are increasingly costly. The NBA secured a $76 billion TV deal over 11 years, up from its prior deal of $24 billion over nine years. And sports rights inflation could cause media companies to raise prices, cut spending in other areas, or both.

This high-profile carriage fight meant that YouTube TV subscribers couldn't watch ESPN's college football games this past weekend, or its popular pregame show ""College GameDay"" through the platform (though it was streamed live without a paywall on both X and the ESPN app). And if the dispute isn't resolved soon, football fans will also miss ""Monday Night Football.""

Disney and ESPN have tried to win over fans by stirring up outrage against YouTube TV. A Disney spokesperson said in a statement that ""Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition."" ESPN has even enlisted megastars like Stephen A. Smith, Scott Van Pelt, and Mike Greenberg in the fight. All three personalities posted short clips on social media informing viewers of the dispute and directing them to a Disney-owned website to petition YouTube TV, which didn't immediately return a request for comment.

But some sports fans aren't feeling too sympathetic to Disney and ESPN.

Instead, a chorus of social media users took out their frustrations on ESPN's boldfaced names. Top replies to Smith, Van Pelt, and Greenberg's X posts included criticisms of the call-to-action to petition YouTube TV, concerns that the standoff between the two corporations would drive up prices, frustrations with the new ESPN app, and even threats to watch ESPN's live sports on pirate sites.

YouTube TV wasn't spared from the backlash, as the top replies to its X posts were pledges to quit. Searches for ""cancel YouTube TV"" spiked immediately after the blackout rose to the highest level in at least five years, according to data from Google Trends. Interest in competing services like Fubo and Hulu + Live TV has also soared to the highest levels in years.

Still, the online pushback against ESPN and its biggest celebrities is notable, especially as the sports network tries to build a direct relationship with consumers.

Some sports fans seem fed up with how streaming is increasingly defined by higher prices and fragmentation, with games spread across several streamers. And while virtual pay-TV services like YouTube TV or Fubo are easier to cancel than cable, they're no longer significantly cheaper.

Disney is in a tough spot, as it needs to collect enough money from providers like YouTube TV to justify its investments in live sports, but doing so risks alienating customers. Sports lovers may already suspect that Disney and ESPN are playing hardball with YouTube TV since it offers several alternatives for fans to watch, including subscribing to the ESPN app directly.

Another risk for Disney and ESPN is that a blackout may train sports fans to either skip the games and watch the highlights instead — or even to find the games on illegal pirating sites. That would be a disastrous outcome for a company recovering from a widely followed boycott that cost it millions of streaming subscribers.

Head of Microsoft's AI division Mustafa Suleyman thinks that AI developers and researchers should stop trying to build conscious AI.

“I don't think that is work that people should be doing,” Suleyman told CNBC in an interview last week.

Suleyman thinks that while AI can definitely get smart enough to reach some form of superintelligence, it is incapable of developing the human emotional experience that is necessary to reach consciousness. At the end of the day, any “emotional” experience that AI seems to experience is just a simulation, he says.

“Our physical experience of pain is something that makes us very sad and feel terrible, but the AI doesn't feel sad when it experiences ‘pain,'” Suleyman told CNBC. “It's really just creating the perception, the seeming narrative of experience and of itself and of consciousness, but that is not what it's actually experiencing.”

“It would be absurd to pursue research that investigates that question, because they're not [conscious] and they can't be,” Suleyman said.

Consciousness is a tricky thing to explain. There are multiple scientific theories that try to describe what consciousness could be. According to one such theory, posited by famous philosopher John Searle who died last month, consciousness is a purely biological phenomenon that cannot be truly replicated by a computer. Many AI researchers, computer scientists and neuroscientists also subscribe to this belief.

Even if this theory turns out to be the truth, that doesn't keep users from attributing consciousness to computers.

“Unfortunately, because the remarkable linguistic abilities of LLMs are increasingly capable of misleading people, people may attribute imaginary qualities to LLMs,” Polish researchers Andrzej Porebski and Yakub Figura wrote in a study published last week, titled “There is no such thing as conscious artificial intelligence.”

In an essay published on his blog in August, Suleyman warned against “seemingly conscious AI.”

“The arrival of Seemingly Conscious AI is inevitable and unwelcome. Instead, we need a vision for AI that can fulfill its potential as a helpful companion without falling prey to its illusions,” Suleyman wrote.

He argues that AI cannot be conscious and the illusion it gives of consciousness could trigger interactions that are “rich in feeling and experience,” a phenomenon that has been dubbed as “AI psychosis” in the cultural lexicon.

There have been numerous high-profile incidents in the past year of AI-obsessions that drive users to fatal delusions, manic episodes and even suicide.

With limited guardrails in place to protect vulnerable users, people are wholeheartedly believing that the AI chatbots they interact with almost every day are having a real, conscious experience. This has led people to “fall in love” with their chatbots, sometimes with fatal consequences like when a 14-year old shot himself to “come home” to Character.AI's personalized chatbot or when a cognitively-impaired man died while trying to get to New York to meet Meta's chatbot in person.

“Just as we should produce AI that prioritizes engagement with humans and real-world interactions in our physical and human world, we should build AI that only ever presents itself as an AI, that maximizes utility while minimizing markers of consciousness,” Suleyman wrote in the blog post. “We must build AI for people, not to be a digital person.”

But because the nature of consciousness is still contested, some researchers are growing worried that the technological advancements in AI might outpace our understanding of how consciousness works.

“If we become able to create consciousness – even accidentally – it would raise immense ethical challenges and even existential risk,” Belgian scientist Axel Cleeremans said last week, announcing a paper he co-wrote calling for consciousness research to become a scientific priority.

Suleyman himself has been vocal about developing “humanist superintelligence” rather than god-like AI, even though he believes that superintelligence won't materialize any time within the next decade.

“i just am more more fixated on ‘how is this actually useful for us as a species?' Like that should be the task of technology,” Suleyman told the Wall Street Journal earlier this year.

Sue  Hughes

 November 03, 2025  

BARCELONA, Spain — Thrombolysis with tenecteplase led to earlier reperfusion and improved functional outcomes at 90 days without any significant safety issues in selected patients with basilar artery occlusion stroke presenting up to 24 hours after symptom onset in the TRACE-5 trial.

“The trial is very important in our field. It supports the use of tenecteplase up to 24 hours in basilar artery occlusion stroke in both endovascular capable or endovascular limited settings,” lead investigator Yunyun (Carol) Xiong, MD, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Beijing, China, said.

The results of the TRACE-5 trial were presented on October 22 at the 17th World Stroke Congress (WSC) 2025.

Basilar artery occlusion accounts for about 1% of all strokes but is among the most devastating, with mortality and disability rates reaching 80%-90% without recanalization.

Thrombolysis is recommended for patients presenting within 4.5 hours, and endovascular therapy (EVT) benefits select cases in the extended window. However, immediate EVT access is often limited.

The recent EXPECTS trial showed that alteplase administered 4.5 to 24 hours after stroke onset could benefit patients with posterior circulation stroke, but the trial population primarily included patients with mild stroke, and those with planned thrombectomy were excluded.

The TRACE-5 trial investigated whether tenecteplase thrombolysis, with or without EVT, could improve outcomes vs standard care in select basilar artery occlusion strokes presenting up to 24 hours after symptom onset.

Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, extensive ischemic changes (posterior circulation Acute Stroke Prognosis Early CT score, < 6), significant cerebellar mass effect, acute hydrocephalus, clear hypodensity on noncontrast CT, or bilateral extensive brainstem ischemia were excluded from the trial based on baseline imaging.

A total of 452 Chinese individuals were randomized to receive tenecteplase or standard of care, which served as the control group. Control patients could receive anticoagulation such as heparin infusion or antiplatelets as per standard care and alteplase if eligible. EVT therapy was performed according to local practice and availability.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an excellent functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 0-1 at 90 days. This was achieved in 37.6% of the tenecteplase group vs 28.6% of the control group (P = .014).

Early reperfusion on initial angiography occurred in 15.4% of the tenecteplase patients vs 7.3% in the control group.

Safety outcomes were similar between the groups, with no signs of increased symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, major bleeding, or death in the tenecteplase group.

Bastian Cheng, MD, stroke neurologist at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany, who was not involved in the study said the findings, said “give the treatment physician the hope that not everything is lost in basilar artery occlusion, and that we should be treating these patients.”

Cheng pointed out that the outcomes were surprisingly good, given that basilar artery occlusion is the most catastrophic type of stroke, and especially as the Chinese population has high rates of stroke caused by intracranial atherosclerosis.

Xiong responded that the impressive early recanalization rate with tenecteplase would have helped patients achieve good functional outcomes.

Cheng asked how generalizable the findings are to other populations, such as western patients, where strokes are more often caused by embolism rather than atherosclerosis.

Xiong noted that atrial fibrillation (AF) is more prevalent in the Caucasian population.

“Previous studies have shown that if patients have AF they are more likely to have a distal occlusion, so we should see similar or even better results from tenecteplase in Caucasian patients,” she said.

Commenting on the study for Medscape Medical News, Raul Nogueira, MD, professor of neurology and neurosurgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, said he thought this was an important trial, with broad application.

“Basilar artery occlusion stroke is a particular problem. It is worse than any other type of stroke. We have recently established that endovascular therapy can help selected patients out to 24 hours, but this is not available everywhere, so now we have an option for these patients who cannot get endovascular treatment. I would say this is a major achievement,” he said.

Jeff Price has started three successful companies — TuneCore, Audiam and Word Collections — to maximize artist royalties while roiling industry waters.


													By
												

	Ed Christman



	Mention Jeff Price‘s name in a room full of music executives and some will almost certainly wince and say that he is a troublemaker — an entrepreneur who enjoys noisily lashing out at those in the business he perceives are not doing right by music artists, songwriters, comedians and other creators.


	Most conspicuously, that sense of righteousness has manifested in a two-year on-and-off email battle — often with journalists, including this reporter cc'd — with the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC), the nonprofit organization established by the Music Modernization Act (MMA) to administer blanket licenses for digital streams and downloads in the United States.


	Price claims that deficiencies in the MLC's operations have deprived clients of his current startup, Word Collections, royalty payments, and, in other cases, have delayed payments.


	What Price's critics rarely acknowledge is that Word Collections is the third successful business that he has built as a result of his indignation. “It's usually a combination of something that I'm frustrated with, combined with having an opportunity in my professional career to correct it,” he says of his entrepreneurial ventures.


	For example: Price founded TuneCore in 2006 to help DIY artists and indie labels get their music onto digital platforms for a fraction of what it previously cost. Then, in 2013, he started Audiam, which claims YouTube publishing royalties for DIY songwriters who, in many cases, are uninformed about music publishing and how to get paid for their work. And he established his latest venture, Word Collections, in 2020 to fight for and collect mechanical royalties for comedians' recordings, which many digital services were not paying at the time.


	Although Price admits he departed the first two companies under unpleasant circumstances — possibly due to his combative nature — TuneCore and Audiam were successfully sold. Word Collections is still in a growth phase, but many of Audiam's investors are helping to fund it — proof that he remains a bankable entrepreneur.


	And these investors are not small players. Key among them is Black Squirrel Partners, the investment division of Metallica's business operations. The band and Black Squirrel were a client and investor, respectively, in Audiam and followed Price to Word Collections, which now also represents music artists. (Pop artist Jason Mraz is among other investors who did the same.)


	The reason: Black Squirrel principal and partner Eric Wasserman says that while at Audiam, Metallica's income “went from a small amount to a significant portion of the revenue from their [intellectual property].”


	The band apparently is happy at Word Collections as well. In July 2023, Price and Word Collections closed on a $5 million investment round led by Black Squirrel, which became its lead investor. “We are very enthusiastic about this company and Jeff's leadership,” Wasserman says. “Word Collections is doing a great job representing the Metallica catalog.” 


	Other Word Collections clients include Greta Van Fleet, The Offspring, Grace Potter, Thomas Dolby, Galactic, John Oates, Switchfoot, Richard Marx and the estate of Johnny Marks, among other songwriters. Word Collections, which employs a staff of 10, also represents the comedy catalogs of Robin Williams, George Carlin, Margaret Cho, Jerry Seinfeld and Billy Crystal, among others.


	Because of his history of saber-rattling, Price acknowledges that industry executives have accused him of being an opportunist looking for industry problems so that he could profit from those issues.


	“Yes, it [can be] a business opportunity, but that's usually not the driving force,” he says. “It isn't like, ‘Ha ha, here's this thing, let me go make money off it.' It's more of, ‘This thing is not right, let's fix it,' which also happens to be a business opportunity.”


‘That's stealing in my mind'


	Slim with gray hair parted in the middle, Price does not resemble a street fighter. He even sports a broad smile in his LinkedIn photo. Of all the stands he has taken against the industry, he is best known for publicly opposing — and loudly criticizing — the MMA, which passed in 2018 and dramatically changed digital music licensing and how payments are made for compositions. He was even part of a group, which dubbed itself the American Music Licensing Collective (AMLC), that vied against the National Music Publishers' Association's (NMPA) preferred assemblage of major music publishers to be designated the MMA's administrator of digital licenses.


	The U.S. Copyright Office went with the NMPA-backed team — now known as the MLC — but not before Price had alienated several of the industry's legacy players. 


	While the passage of the MMA was largely hailed as a beneficial game-changer for songwriters, Price alleges that the law created a form of legal theft that benefits large publishers. That's because songs for which the publisher or payout instructions cannot be determined are designated as black-box monies — they are also called unmatched or unclaimed royalties — and if the rightful recipient cannot be determined within three years, the MLC has the authority to distribute these monies to publishers based on their market share. 


	Unmatched royalties total hundreds of millions of dollars annually, and Price contends that the bulk of them are generated by DIY creators who don't know how to properly register their songs with the MLC. Worse, he says, if those creators learn belatedly that their royalties were distributed elsewhere, they cannot retroactively claim them, because according to the text of the MMA, distributions of unclaimed and/or unmatched royalties “shall supersede and preempt any state law (including common law) concerning escheatment or abandoned property, or any analogous provision, that might otherwise apply.” 


	“I believe [digital services] should get a license and pay a commensurate royalty, and the entity that earns the royalty should get the money,” Price says. “The other side is like, ‘We don't want to do that. Why don't we just take all this money that's not getting paid and hand it to ourselves based on a black-box [market-share] allocation?' And that's stealing, in my mind.” 


	However, the MLC has yet to use this market-share mechanism to disburse any black-box monies, which have been accumulating for the last eight years and predate the passage of the MMA. 


	Price has other issues with the MLC, and in addition to the blizzard of emails he has sent its CEO, Kris Ahrend, and other executives there, his complaints are collected in a 53-page memo submitted by Word Collections that opposes redesignating the organization as the administrator of blanket compulsory mechanical licenses “without significant policy and governance changes to achieve the [MMA's] intended goals and objectives.”


	Word Collections' memo is one of 63 posted on the U.S. Copyright Office website as it conducts a mandated periodic review on whether the MLC should be redesignated. While other submissions suggest improvements, the overwhelming majority support the MLC's reappointment, if the more than 500 publishing companies and industry trade organizations cited in the MLC's own filing are counted. Among those in favor are Warner Chappell Music, peermusic, the RIAA, the Recording Academy, the Academy of Country Music, the Association of Independent Music Publishers and the NMPA.


	The MLC declined to comment, but industry executives say in its defense that the organization is dealing with a vast amount of data and, as a result, its execution “will never be flawless or perfect,” as one music publishing source puts it.


	In the early days of streaming, Price's squeaky-wheel approach earned him grudging respect as a renegade. But over the years, his detractors have grown in number, and some say they are weary of his unyielding combativeness, even if he is right.


‘The messenger being the problem'


	One executive says Price “is a classic example of the messenger being the problem, not the message,” explaining, “While he is really trying to get the most money for songwriters, the way he has gone about highlighting these issues pisses off everybody.” 


	An executive in the digital music realm calls Price “litigious.” In reality, Price has not directly sued any digital services, but through data supplied by his company, he was involved in songwriter lawsuits filed against Spotify, including a 2017 legal action led by Camper Van Beethoven founder and musicians' rights activist David Lowery that resulted in a $45 million settlement, and others by Four Seasons member and songwriter Bob Gaudio, Bluewater Music, and Dolby.


	Word Collections' data was also used in lawsuits filed by a number of comics against Pandora, including Andrew Dice Clay, Bill Engvall, Ron White and the estates of Carlin and Williams. Price says his clients usually don't resort to litigation until a digital service has spent about a year ignoring requests for payment. 


	Others in the industry offer a more charitable assessment of Price. One executive who has crossed swords with him says he's “difficult to work with” but concedes that “98% of what he says is correct.” The executive adds, “[Price] is not a lawyer, so sometimes he gets a nuance wrong, but in terms of the important stuff — like how digital services didn't pay publishing properly and what's wrong with the system in publishing — he was the only one making noise.”


	“I think Jeff is a catalyst and is brilliant,” says Jordan Bromley, entertainment group leader for law firm Manatt Phelps & Phillips. “Guys like him don't follow rules or lines of politics. They say the quiet things out loud.”


	Though Price concedes that he “once” apologized to the MLC for mistakenly claiming it hadn't paid out Pandora royalties due to Word Collections, he expresses no regret for his unflagging approach to perceived transgressors. “Water on stone eventually makes the Grand Canyon,” he says. “I am working from outside the system to change the system.”


	Before entering the music industry, Price lived an itinerant life. His mother founded an advertising agency in the 1970s when it was still a male-dominated business, and they moved frequently for her career. Growing up, he says he attended eight schools in a 12-year period. He also spent time in Japan and Israel, where he served in the latter's military reserve. He worked as a bartender, sold books out of mall kiosks and was a production assistant for film/TV producer Rachael Horovitz, the older sister of the Beastie Boys' Adam “Ad-Rock” Horovitz.


	Price, who attributes his rectitude to once witnessing his father stop an attack against another person, entered the music industry in 1991 as a co-founder of the SpinART indie label, which released the music of such indie acts as Frank Black, The Church, Apples in Stereo, The Boo Radleys and Vic Chesnutt before succumbing to bankruptcy in 2007. “SpinART taught me everything I know about the industry,” Price says. “I wouldn't be able to make informed decisions without the knowledge that experience gave me.”


	As iTunes, Rhapsody and other online music stores started up, Price began looking for a digital distributor for SpinART, but says he was angered by the terms he was offered, especially what he considered unwarranted high distribution fees. “Distributors were demanding 15% to 30% of revenue to basically send a digital file to places like Apple and Amazon,” he says. “Overlaying the analog business funnel on top of the digital channel just didn't make sense.”


	Price voiced his grievances in a 2006 issue of Billboard. “I despise the economic model of aggregators. They are morally repugnant,” he said. “On the physical side, distributors work their asses off. They provide co-op opportunities; they'll have regional sales reps. In the digital world, they don't provide that service. They're an aggregator.”


	Through his dissatisfaction, Price saw an opportunity to fill a void in the market, and with partners Gary Burke and Peter Wells launched TuneCore in 2006. To date, it's his most successful venture and remains a major indie player 13 years after he and his partners left the company.


	TuneCore's model was simple and elegant. It initially charged a flat rate of $7.98 an album per year and a delivery charge of 99 cents per song to put titles up on all the digital stores, with all sales revenue going to the artist. By 2010, prices had increased to $49.99 an album per year and $9.99 per song. 


	Price's refusal to play by established rules earned him scorn when he created his own International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) — essentially digital fingerprints for tracking royalties — for works released by TuneCore artists instead of paying the RIAA, which, at the time, assigned the codes.


‘Took off like a rocket‘


	TuneCore “took off like a rocket and it was a heck of a learning curve,” Price recalls. “All of a sudden, we were doing over a million dollars a month. We were like, ‘Holy crap!' And then that number became $8 million to $10 million a month. It got crazy how quickly it grew.” 


	The company eventually needed funding to accommodate that growth and brought in Guitar Center and Opus Capital as investors. But the introduction of private equity blew up management in 2012. Price and some of his staff were ousted, and in 2015, the company was acquired by Believe Music, where it is now one of the largest independent distributors in the world. 


	While at TuneCore, Price realized that indie artists were not collecting their fair share of music publishing royalties and started a publishing administration division. After his departure, he founded Audiam in June 2013 as, he says, a corrective. 


	His team built a system that tracked down cover versions of songs and user-generated videos on YouTube and other streaming platforms that included unlicensed recordings of songs. On behalf of its clients, Audiam claimed the songs to collect both publishing and recorded master royalties that were due.


	A publisher administrator client of Audiam says, “We may have found 30 cover versions of a song, but when Jeff entered the picture, he said, ‘Here are 225 ISRC cover versions of that song.' ” 


	Like TuneCore, anyone could sign up for Audiam, but this time Price's economic model took an undisclosed percentage of the revenue. 


	Official videos of a song were easy to find and claim, but songs included in user-generated videos and cover versions performed by DIY artists were not, and Audiam's success enabled the company to expand into licensing and collecting publishing royalties from other digital platforms such as Spotify and Amazon. But that meant Price was soon butting heads with those platforms' service agents, like the Harry Fox Agency and Music Reports Inc.


	Audiam eventually attracted major artists such as Metallica, Mraz and Jimmy Buffett. Industry heavyweights also invested, including Q Prime co-founder Cliff Burnstein, then-WME head of music Mark Geiger, Victory Records founder Tony Brummel, Distrokid founder Philip Kaplan, Silva Entertainment namesake Bill Silva and Provident Financial Management.


	When Audiam's growth required new sources of funding, Price and his investors agreed to sell the company to the Canadian performing rights organization SOCAN in 2016. But his relationship with the PRO soured, in part because of his vociferous opposition to the MMA and the NMPA's backing of the legislation that calls for market-share distribution of black-box monies. 


	When Price and the AMLC team he helped assemble began jockeying with the NMPA's choice to administer blanket mechanical licenses for the MMA, informed sources say his efforts — which included posting videos to YouTube that questioned the fairness and transparency of music publishing — resulted in SOCAN management taking fire from the mainstream music industry. 


	SOCAN pressured Price to abandon his protest, sources say, and his relationship with the PRO became further complicated when Audiam's investors began agitating for an additional equity payout because, they claimed, the company had hit previously agreed-upon profit performance targets. 


	Price says he resigned due to the equity payout issue, which created a conflict because he was serving as his initial investors' security representative while also still leading the company. He says he agreed to stay on long enough to help prepare Audiam for a sale, but was terminated before that happened.


	Price declines to elaborate but says his parting with Audiam, like his departure from TuneCore, was “unpleasant,” and in 2021, SOCAN sold the company — ironically, to the MLC's data management agent, the Harry Fox Agency, which is now owned by the Blackstone-owned SESAC Music Group. As for Audiam's investors, sources say that a lawsuit filed on their behalf resulted in an undisclosed settlement in addition to the initial payout from the sale. (SOCAN declined to comment, as did Eric Baptiste, who led the PRO when it purchased Audiam.)


	By then, Price had started Word Collections, which originally focused on comedy streams. He likened comedians' jokes to song compositions that were deserving of publishing royalties. Up to then, most digital services had been paying record labels for comedic master recordings but not the underlying literary compositions. “That's what Jeff does,” says ClearBox Rights founder and principal John Barker. “He recognizes when people aren't getting paid, and he finds a solution.”


	After the expiration of Price's noncompete clause with Audiam, Word Collections expanded into music publishing administration, putting him in competition with his former company. And though TuneCore remains Price's most successful startup, he claims Word Collections' revenue now matches the publishing royalty volume collected by Audiam. 


	Price retains strong opinions on the MMA and gives no indication that he's ready to ease up on the MLC, certainly as long as publisher market share could be used to disburse black-box monies. But he claims he has dialed back his combativeness on a number of industry issues because much of what he complained about has been corrected. 


	And in a number of ways, Price is no longer the outsider he claims to be. “It's an interesting paradox for me,” he says. “We are directly licensed outside North America with the largest digital services in the world, which enables Word Collections to collect mechanical and performance royalties from streams. Wherever we can, we disintermediate the CMOs, the subpublishers and the black boxes in between songwriters and their money. For nondigital, we collect from 104 countries and are direct members in 40 of the music rights organizations in their countries through a joint venture with Nashville publishing administrator Bluewater Music,” he adds. “We work for some of the most important artists in the world and some of the biggest artist management companies and music companies in the world. I like being on the same side of the fence as them.”

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Fox has put in development Bewitched, an hourlong reimagining of the classic TV series. It comes from writer/executive producer Judalina Neira (The Boys, Daisy Jones and the Six), executive producer Doug Robinson and Sony Pictures Television.


	Both Neira and Robinson are based at Sony TV and have re-upped their overall deals with the indie studio.


	The Bewitched reboot was the first project Neira took on via her Famous Last Words Productions when she signed her first overall deal with Sony TV in early 2024. She was teamed from the get-go with Robinson and Lauren Moffat of Doug Robinson Productions who executive produce alongside her.

	Developed internally at Sony TV, the project was taken out over the summer, landing at Fox. As per usual in the current environment, it took close to two months for the deal to close. Sony TV will co-produce the potential series with Fox Entertainment.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The two companies have an existing business framework as Sony TV has become a top scripted series supplier to the independent broadcast network with shows such as sophomore hit Doc, animated comedy series Universal Basic Guys, as well as dramas Accused and Alert.


	In the new Bewitched, whose tone is described as heartfelt, though they come from two wildly different worlds — he's a human, she's a witch — for Samantha and Darrin, it's love at first sight. But in order to be together, they'll have to navigate their disapproving parents, walk a tightrope of cultural clashes, and bridge the divides between their families and worlds.

	











	Already the longest-tenured producer at Sony TV, Robinson is extending his stay at the studio where he has been for 23 years. Over that time, he has executive produced such series for the studio as Rules of Engagement (via Happy Madison), The Goldbergs and For Life.


	Neira is an executive producer on Sony TV's superhero hit for Prime Video The Boys, which is headed to its fifth and final season, and served in the same capacity on another Prime Video series, horror dark comedy The Horror of Dolores Roach. She also worked on The Boys offshoot Gen V as co-executive producer. 


	Additionally, Neira was a supervising producer on Prime Video's Daisy Jones & the Six, sharing in the show's 2023 Emmy nomination for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series. Her series credits also include Apple TV's The Morning Show and the CW's The Flash. 


	A graduate of the 2023 WGA Showrunner Training Program, Neira is an alumnus of the National Hispanic Media Coalition's Series Scriptwriters Program, a governor emeritus of the Television Academy's Writers Peer Group, and the co-founder of La Lista – a networking group for working Latina television writers. She is repped by Kaplan Stahler, Kaplan/Perrone, and attorney David Hiller.


	Created by Sol Saks and executive produced by Harry Ackerman, Bewitched ran for eight seasons on ABC from 1964-72. It starred Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha, a witch married to an ordinary mortal man, Darrin, and chronicles the way her powers and family get in the way of her efforts to live a normal, magic-free life as a typical suburban housewife. A short-lived spinoff about Samantha's daughter, Tabitha, ran on ABC in 1977.


	There have been separate attempts by ABC, NBC and CBS over the past decade and a half to develop a Bewitched reboot with Sony TV. 


	Like the original, all three projects were half-hour comedies. The dramatic, hourlong take by Neira is reminiscent of the Bel-Air drama reimagining of the Will Smith sitcom, which streams on Peacock. Neira has background in drama, comedy and drama with comedic/satiric elements, and Robinson also has worked across both comedy and drama.


	Additionally, there is a live-action family Bewitched series following pre-teen Tabitha, which remains in active development from the Sony Pictures Television Kids division and Flying Bark.

Watched it some originally but never felt it was ” must see ” TV.

Do wish Elizabeth Montgomery had had more chance at showing her true acting ability in better stuff.RIP

Go Judalina!!! Ignore the haters. The reality is, you need an existing IP these days for it to sell. That isn't the writers fault nor for lack of creativity. I'm looking forward to see this one.

I think this is a terrible idea, but I love what Judalina Neira did with DAISY JONES.

More reheated IP that no one asked for.

The first one was campy as hell, they always seem to forget that part.
