                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeff Price has started three successful companies — TuneCore, Audiam and Word Collections — to maximize artist royalties while roiling industry waters. Mention Jeff Price‘s name in a room full of music executives and some will almost certainly wince and say that he is a troublemaker — an entrepreneur who enjoys noisily lashing out at those in the business he perceives are not doing right by music artists, songwriters, comedians and other creators. Price claims that deficiencies in the MLC's operations have deprived clients of his current startup, Word Collections, royalty payments, and, in other cases, have delayed payments. What Price's critics rarely acknowledge is that Word Collections is the third successful business that he has built as a result of his indignation. “It's usually a combination of something that I'm frustrated with, combined with having an opportunity in my professional career to correct it,” he says of his entrepreneurial ventures. For example: Price founded TuneCore in 2006 to help DIY artists and indie labels get their music onto digital platforms for a fraction of what it previously cost. Then, in 2013, he started Audiam, which claims YouTube publishing royalties for DIY songwriters who, in many cases, are uninformed about music publishing and how to get paid for their work. And he established his latest venture, Word Collections, in 2020 to fight for and collect mechanical royalties for comedians' recordings, which many digital services were not paying at the time. Although Price admits he departed the first two companies under unpleasant circumstances — possibly due to his combative nature — TuneCore and Audiam were successfully sold. Word Collections is still in a growth phase, but many of Audiam's investors are helping to fund it — proof that he remains a bankable entrepreneur. Key among them is Black Squirrel Partners, the investment division of Metallica's business operations. (Pop artist Jason Mraz is among other investors who did the same.) The reason: Black Squirrel principal and partner Eric Wasserman says that while at Audiam, Metallica's income “went from a small amount to a significant portion of the revenue from their [intellectual property].” The band apparently is happy at Word Collections as well. In July 2023, Price and Word Collections closed on a $5 million investment round led by Black Squirrel, which became its lead investor. “We are very enthusiastic about this company and Jeff's leadership,” Wasserman says. “Word Collections is doing a great job representing the Metallica catalog.” Other Word Collections clients include Greta Van Fleet, The Offspring, Grace Potter, Thomas Dolby, Galactic, John Oates, Switchfoot, Richard Marx and the estate of Johnny Marks, among other songwriters. Word Collections, which employs a staff of 10, also represents the comedy catalogs of Robin Williams, George Carlin, Margaret Cho, Jerry Seinfeld and Billy Crystal, among others. “Yes, it [can be] a business opportunity, but that's usually not the driving force,” he says. Slim with gray hair parted in the middle, Price does not resemble a street fighter. He even sports a broad smile in his LinkedIn photo. Of all the stands he has taken against the industry, he is best known for publicly opposing — and loudly criticizing — the MMA, which passed in 2018 and dramatically changed digital music licensing and how payments are made for compositions. He was even part of a group, which dubbed itself the American Music Licensing Collective (AMLC), that vied against the National Music Publishers' Association's (NMPA) preferred assemblage of major music publishers to be designated the MMA's administrator of digital licenses. That's because songs for which the publisher or payout instructions cannot be determined are designated as black-box monies — they are also called unmatched or unclaimed royalties — and if the rightful recipient cannot be determined within three years, the MLC has the authority to distribute these monies to publishers based on their market share. Worse, he says, if those creators learn belatedly that their royalties were distributed elsewhere, they cannot retroactively claim them, because according to the text of the MMA, distributions of unclaimed and/or unmatched royalties “shall supersede and preempt any state law (including common law) concerning escheatment or abandoned property, or any analogous provision, that might otherwise apply.” Why don't we just take all this money that's not getting paid and hand it to ourselves based on a black-box [market-share] allocation?' Copyright Office website as it conducts a mandated periodic review on whether the MLC should be redesignated. The MLC declined to comment, but industry executives say in its defense that the organization is dealing with a vast amount of data and, as a result, its execution “will never be flawless or perfect,” as one music publishing source puts it. In the early days of streaming, Price's squeaky-wheel approach earned him grudging respect as a renegade. But over the years, his detractors have grown in number, and some say they are weary of his unyielding combativeness, even if he is right. An executive in the digital music realm calls Price “litigious.” In reality, Price has not directly sued any digital services, but through data supplied by his company, he was involved in songwriter lawsuits filed against Spotify, including a 2017 legal action led by Camper Van Beethoven founder and musicians' rights activist David Lowery that resulted in a $45 million settlement, and others by Four Seasons member and songwriter Bob Gaudio, Bluewater Music, and Dolby. Word Collections' data was also used in lawsuits filed by a number of comics against Pandora, including Andrew Dice Clay, Bill Engvall, Ron White and the estates of Carlin and Williams. Others in the industry offer a more charitable assessment of Price. One executive who has crossed swords with him says he's “difficult to work with” but concedes that “98% of what he says is correct.” The executive adds, “[Price] is not a lawyer, so sometimes he gets a nuance wrong, but in terms of the important stuff — like how digital services didn't pay publishing properly and what's wrong with the system in publishing — he was the only one making noise.” “Guys like him don't follow rules or lines of politics. “Water on stone eventually makes the Grand Canyon,” he says. Before entering the music industry, Price lived an itinerant life. His mother founded an advertising agency in the 1970s when it was still a male-dominated business, and they moved frequently for her career. He worked as a bartender, sold books out of mall kiosks and was a production assistant for film/TV producer Rachael Horovitz, the older sister of the Beastie Boys' Adam “Ad-Rock” Horovitz. “SpinART taught me everything I know about the industry,” Price says. “I wouldn't be able to make informed decisions without the knowledge that experience gave me.” In the digital world, they don't provide that service. Through his dissatisfaction, Price saw an opportunity to fill a void in the market, and with partners Gary Burke and Peter Wells launched TuneCore in 2006. It initially charged a flat rate of $7.98 an album per year and a delivery charge of 99 cents per song to put titles up on all the digital stores, with all sales revenue going to the artist. Price's refusal to play by established rules earned him scorn when he created his own International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) — essentially digital fingerprints for tracking royalties — for works released by TuneCore artists instead of paying the RIAA, which, at the time, assigned the codes. But the introduction of private equity blew up management in 2012. While at TuneCore, Price realized that indie artists were not collecting their fair share of music publishing royalties and started a publishing administration division. His team built a system that tracked down cover versions of songs and user-generated videos on YouTube and other streaming platforms that included unlicensed recordings of songs. On behalf of its clients, Audiam claimed the songs to collect both publishing and recorded master royalties that were due. Like TuneCore, anyone could sign up for Audiam, but this time Price's economic model took an undisclosed percentage of the revenue. But that meant Price was soon butting heads with those platforms' service agents, like the Harry Fox Agency and Music Reports Inc. Audiam eventually attracted major artists such as Metallica, Mraz and Jimmy Buffett. Industry heavyweights also invested, including Q Prime co-founder Cliff Burnstein, then-WME head of music Mark Geiger, Victory Records founder Tony Brummel, Distrokid founder Philip Kaplan, Silva Entertainment namesake Bill Silva and Provident Financial Management. When Audiam's growth required new sources of funding, Price and his investors agreed to sell the company to the Canadian performing rights organization SOCAN in 2016. SOCAN pressured Price to abandon his protest, sources say, and his relationship with the PRO became further complicated when Audiam's investors began agitating for an additional equity payout because, they claimed, the company had hit previously agreed-upon profit performance targets. Price says he resigned due to the equity payout issue, which created a conflict because he was serving as his initial investors' security representative while also still leading the company. As for Audiam's investors, sources say that a lawsuit filed on their behalf resulted in an undisclosed settlement in addition to the initial payout from the sale. (SOCAN declined to comment, as did Eric Baptiste, who led the PRO when it purchased Audiam.) By then, Price had started Word Collections, which originally focused on comedy streams. He likened comedians' jokes to song compositions that were deserving of publishing royalties. Up to then, most digital services had been paying record labels for comedic master recordings but not the underlying literary compositions. “That's what Jeff does,” says ClearBox Rights founder and principal John Barker. After the expiration of Price's noncompete clause with Audiam, Word Collections expanded into music publishing administration, putting him in competition with his former company. And though TuneCore remains Price's most successful startup, he claims Word Collections' revenue now matches the publishing royalty volume collected by Audiam. Price retains strong opinions on the MMA and gives no indication that he's ready to ease up on the MLC, certainly as long as publisher market share could be used to disburse black-box monies. And in a number of ways, Price is no longer the outsider he claims to be. “We are directly licensed outside North America with the largest digital services in the world, which enables Word Collections to collect mechanical and performance royalties from streams. For nondigital, we collect from 104 countries and are direct members in 40 of the music rights organizations in their countries through a joint venture with Nashville publishing administrator Bluewater Music,” he adds.

Related Stories South Asian Storytelling Nonprofit 1497 Wraps Features Lab with Ritesh Batra, Boots Riley, and More ‘Lost Land' Review: The First Movie Shot in the Rohingya Language Is a Powerful and Unflinching Story of Displacement “100 Nights of Hero” premiered at the 2025 Venice International Film Festival, where it earned overwhelming praise for its sharp pop sensibilities and writer/director Julia Jackman's ability to update a classic storytelling format for more contemporary sensibilities. “What makes the work remarkable is its sincerity,” Leila Latif wrote in her IndieWire review. “In a cinematic landscape increasingly dominated by algorithm-driven sameness, this film stands out for its defiant originality. That message, articulated through Cherry and Hero's connection, resonates far beyond the screen. By the end, one feels not just entertained, but invigorated. Jackman's film is a joyous testament to independence, creativity, and the enduring necessity of stories. It proves that happy endings need not conform to centuries-old formulas, and that love, be it romantic, platonic, queer, or fleeting, can be as complex and wondrous as any of the tales we tell.” An Independent Film Company release, “100 Nights of Hero” opens in theaters on Friday, December 5.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kehlani's "Folded" flies 14-7, following the release of new remixes. Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” notches a fourth week at No. Helping the song's continued Hot 100 command, Swift released its “Alone in My Tower Acoustic Version” for digital purchase Oct. 28, just after 4:30 p.m. (A CD single of the new mix, along with its instrumental, and a CD single of the song's original version and its instrumental went up for pre-order in Swift's webstore from late Oct. 30 through the afternoon of Oct. 31; those CD sales will impact charts once singles are shipped.) Meanwhile, after first appearing on the Hot 100 in 2016, Kehlani achieves her first top 10 on the chart, as “Folded” surges seven spots to No. Check out the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations.

In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. “The Fate of Ophelia” drew 29.1 million official streams (down 13%) and 54.5 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 10%) and sold 22,000 (up 236%) in the United States Oct. 24-30. The single scores a fourth week at No. “The Fate of Ophelia” became Swift's 13th career Hot 100 No. Swift now solely has the eighth-most weeks spent atop the Hot 100, as “The Fate of Ophelia” ups her count to a milestone 40, breaking her out of a tie with Bruno Mars: (Beyoncé's total above does not include her 17 weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100 as a member of Destiny's Child, while Jackson's doesn't include his 10 weeks on top as part of the Jackson 5.) Swift also ties for the fifth-most Hot 100 No. 1s that have dominated for four or more weeks, as “The Fate of Ophelia” becomes her fifth. As previously reported, “The Fate of Ophelia” parent album The Life of a Showgirl adds a fourth week atop the Billboard 200 chart, following its modern-era-record debut with 4.002 million equivalent album units three weeks earlier. Swift's concurrent command over Billboard's premier album and song charts hits more historic heights. Helping propel “Folded,” six remixes were released Oct. 24 as an “Homage Pack,” one each with Toni Braxton, Brandy, JoJo, Mario, Ne-Yo and Tank. (All versions except for the one with Tank contribute to the song's singular chart listing; that mix does not due to Kehlani's vocals being much more minimized than on the others. The Oakland, Calif., native has charted 18 Hot 100 entries, including two top 40 hits in addition to “Folded,” both via featured turns on Cardi B songs: “Safe” (No. Kehlani first reached the chart with “Gangsta” in August 2016 and is proof that persistence pays off, as her wait of nine years, two months and two weeks between first appearing on the chart and first hitting the top 10 marks the longest such journey since Kacey Musgraves took 10 years, eight months and two weeks from “Merry Go Round” in 2012 through Zach Bryan's “I Remember Everything,” on which she's featured, in 2023. HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters, is steady at No. 2 on the Hot 100, following eight weeks at No. Alex Warren's “Ordinary,” which led the Hot 100 for 10 weeks starting in May, keeps at No. 3, while topping Radio Songs for a landmark 20th week (78.5 million in audience, down 1%). Only two other songs have reached 20 or weeks atop the airplay tally: Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” (27, beginning in August 2024) and The Weeknd's “Blinding Lights” (26, starting in April 2020). Olivia Dean's first Hot 100 entry, “Man I Need,” becomes her first top five hit, climbing 8-5, and Justin Bieber's “Daisies” pushes 7-6, after reaching No. Morgan Wallen's “I Got Better” holds at No. 7, as it leads the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart for a fourth week, and Leon Thomas' “Mutt” sits at its No. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

But in order to be together, they'll have to navigate their disapproving parents, walk a tightrope of cultural clashes, and bridge the divides between their families and worlds. Already the longest-tenured producer at Sony TV, Robinson is extending his stay at the studio where he has been for 23 years. Over that time, he has executive produced such series for the studio as Rules of Engagement (via Happy Madison), The Goldbergs and For Life. Neira is an executive producer on Sony TV's superhero hit for Prime Video The Boys, which is headed to its fifth and final season, and served in the same capacity on another Prime Video series, horror dark comedy The Horror of Dolores Roach. She also worked on The Boys offshoot Gen V as co-executive producer. Additionally, Neira was a supervising producer on Prime Video's Daisy Jones & the Six, sharing in the show's 2023 Emmy nomination for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series. A graduate of the 2023 WGA Showrunner Training Program, Neira is an alumnus of the National Hispanic Media Coalition's Series Scriptwriters Program, a governor emeritus of the Television Academy's Writers Peer Group, and the co-founder of La Lista – a networking group for working Latina television writers. She is repped by Kaplan Stahler, Kaplan/Perrone, and attorney David Hiller. It starred Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha, a witch married to an ordinary mortal man, Darrin, and chronicles the way her powers and family get in the way of her efforts to live a normal, magic-free life as a typical suburban housewife. A short-lived spinoff about Samantha's daughter, Tabitha, ran on ABC in 1977. There have been separate attempts by ABC, NBC and CBS over the past decade and a half to develop a Bewitched reboot with Sony TV. Like the original, all three projects were half-hour comedies. Additionally, there is a live-action family Bewitched series following pre-teen Tabitha, which remains in active development from the Sony Pictures Television Kids division and Flying Bark.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Krysten Ritter (Jessica Jones), Cameron Crovetti (The Boy), Sarah Bolger (Mayans M.C.) and Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix) are set to star in creature horror thriller Claire. Producers Matthew R. Cooper and Anna Dragoo of Objectively Good Media (OGM), along with Sterling Beaumon and Thomas Mahoney, announced the upcoming horror feature on Monday ahead of an AFM sales launch. Tracy Kleeman, whose short film Fear Filter was a viral hit, generating 10 million views, makes her feature directorial debut on the film. Ritter plays Claire, a struggling single mother battling addiction, as a malevolent creature that feeds on despair begins to terrorize her and her two sons. As her fight for sobriety deepens, the line between inner demons and real monsters, blurs, culminating in a harrowing battle for survival and redemption. The project is executive produced by Julie Kroll, Lior Haas, Lisa Wolofsky and Edoardo Bussi of Twenty-Nine Palms Entertainment, who is overseeing global sales and will be presenting the title to distributors at the AFM. “As a staunch advocate for addiction and recovery stories, Claire brilliantly balances its creature feature/ horror elements with the frustrating realities of living with an active addict. I couldn't be prouder of Tracy, Krysten, Sarah, John and the entire team for shepherding this project to fruition” says producer Matthew R. Cooper (Damned If You Do, Honk for Jesus, Tankhouse). Bussi, who launched London-based international sales and production company earlier this year, will be leading sales discussions at the AFM. “At Twenty-Nine Palms, our mission is to champion bold, visionary stories that transcend genre while maintaining commercial appeal,” he said. “Claire is exactly that, an emotionally charged, terrifyingly original horror film that invites audiences everywhere to confront what haunts us most. Kleeman is represented by CAA and Redshift Management; Ritter by CAA, Industry Entertainment, Principal LA and Brecheen Feldman; Crovetti by Osbrink Talent Agency, Industry Entertainment as well as  Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher; Sarah Bolger by Mosaic, IAG, Accelerate, Rick Genow at Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher, and Carrie-Anne Moss by Elizabeth Hodgson,  Hodgson Management Group, Robert Lange at Kleinberg, Lange, Cuddy & Carlo, Jennifer Allen at Viewpoint.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cardi B has made her football WAG debut, pulling out all the stops on Sunday night to cheer on boyfriend Stefon Diggs at Gillette Stadium. For her first-ever game, the pregnant singer chose head-to-toe Bottega Veneta. Underneath, Cardi wore a coordinated burgundy jumpsuit and thigh-high woven leather boots that matched her colorful coat and gloves. And, as a final touch, she carried an exotic Hermès Birkin in burgundy. Cardi seems to have hard-launched her field-side outing as a good luck charm. Not only did the Patriots beat the Atlanta Falcons 24-23, but Diggs also caught an 11-yard touchdown pass that had his girlfriend up out of her seat, hands in the air. In a post-game interview, Diggs shared that Cardi might have been late to the game, adding, “I've gotta do my homework … I've gotta watch the tape on that one,” and, when questioned about whether he taught her the touchdown celebration, he joked, “she picked it up on her own … her dance moves are a little shaky, though.” Taking to X after the game, she celebrated by writing, “BIG PAAATTTTSSSS!!!! …You from Boston let's have a little tea partyyyyyy GRRRR.” Though not specifically Patriots red, the 33-year-old certainly came dressed as the festive supporter in burgundy, taking a cue from fellow football girlfriend (turned fiancée) Taylor Swift, who also turns it up in team colors when supporting her man on the field.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daniel Lopatin will release his upcoming Oneohtrix Point Never album, Tranquilizer, later this month, and, today, he's previewing the LP with a new song. “Cherry Blue” comes with a music video by Pol Taburet, marking the French artist's first-ever foray into the medium. Tranquilizer is out digitally on November 17 and physically on November 21 via Warp. “Cherry Blue” is the fifth preview of the album, following “For Residue,” “Bumpy,” “Lifeworld,” and “Measuring Ruins.” The follow-up to 2023's Oneohtrix Point Never album Again was “shaped by commercial audio construction kits from a bygone era—an index of cliches turned inside out,” according to Lopatin. Beyond his Oneohtrix Point Never moniker, Lopatin also scored the new Josh Safdie film Marty Supreme, starring Timothée Chalamet, Gwyneth Paltrow, Tyler, the Creator, and Abel Ferrara. That movie screens in U.S. theaters starting on December 25. He previously worked with the Safdie Brothers on their movies Good Time, for which Lopatin won the Soundtrack Award at Cannes Film Festival, and Uncut Gems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation and extortion countersuit against Blake Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, has been officially ended by the judge overseeing the case. On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Liman entered a final judgement stating that Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios co-plaintiffs had declined to file an amended complaint, according to court documents obtained by Page Six. The actress, 38, asked that her request for legal fees remain active, which Liman granted. At the time, Liman ruled that Baldoni and his co-plaintiffs “have not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements in her [California Civil Rights Department] complaint, which are privileged.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Lively first accused her “It Ends With Us” co-star and director of sexual harassment and retaliation in December 2024, going on to formally sue him later that month. The New York Times was first to report on her claims. Liman explained that Baldoni's countersuit “alleged that Reynolds and [publicist Leslie] Sloane made additional statements accusing Baldoni of sexual misconduct and that the Times made additional statements accusing the Wayfarer Parties of engaging in a smear campaign.” However, Liman continued, “The Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Reynolds, Sloane or the Times would have seriously doubted these statements were true based on the information available to them, as is required for them to be liable for defamation under applicable law.” Baldoni, 41, has continued to deny Lively's allegations against him.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But my real self is as much the negative stuff.” That “negative stuff” comes through in spades in Gilligan's new series, Pluribus, his first since the stories of Walter White and Saul Goodman ended three years ago. It is set in an entirely new world and built around a character, Carol, whom Apple TV+ describes as “the most miserable person on Earth.” “I'm not unlike Carol, really,” Gilligan continues. That glass-half-empty approach might explain why it's taken almost two decades for Gilligan to make something not set in what fans have taken to calling the Heisenberg universe of Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, Saul Goodman and Co. Most producers in his position would have used the clout from Breaking Bad's success to make a dream project. But to Gilligan, who launched that series after a fallow career stretch following the end of The X-Files, where he first learned to write and direct for television, the phenomenon it became felt more than a little fluky. “I was nervous about leaving the Heisenberg universe,” he admits. “Some people who read my biography are going to say ‘Well, this guy got real lucky real early.' And suddenly, Breaking Bad happens, and it turns into this thing that was beyond any of our wildest expectations. “And that's not false modesty or aw-shucks, gee-whiz performative whatever,” he insists. I don't know what we did right to make it go off like a skyrocket. If Breaking Bad had been the exact same show, but it had come out 10 years sooner or 10 years later, maybe no one would be talking about it. But now, Gilligan has finally cashed in the blank check to which he's been long entitled. Pluribus has a reported budget of $15 million per episode, five times more than what the average Breaking Bad cost. Pluribus, on the other hand, is a wholly original concept — one so strange and specific, I'm barely allowed to say anything about it, save that, as Apple TV+ describes it, the aforementioned most miserable person on Earth “must save the world from happiness.” Our cranky heroine is played by Saul alum Rhea Seehorn, beloved by fans of the spin-off but far from a household name. It takes advantage of everything Gilligan learned about patient storytelling with Breaking Bad and Saul, then combines it with the high-concept ambition of X-Files, as well as the visual flair Gilligan has developed as a director on all his shows. Though the plot involves every person on the planet, the focus is often entirely on Carol, as Gilligan relies on all the things he realized Seehorn could do — tragedy, slapstick, and sheer screen presence — during her time playing attorney Kim Wexler on Saul. There are long stretches where we're just watching Carol struggle through various tasks, like digging a grave. How Bob Odenkirk's Heart Attack Rocked 'Better Call Saul' How the 'Netflix Effect' Saved 'Girls5eva,' 'The Tourist' and Other TV Orphans The sprawling premise gave Gilligan his first opportunity to film outside of North America, including stops in northern Spain and the Canary Islands. Rather, it's him being happy with the house he and wife Holly Rice bought in New Mexico during the Heisenberg years, plus a desire to keep working with a local production crew with whom he's developed a near-telepathic bond over nearly two decades. Lawsuit Against Spotify Claims ‘Billions' of Drake Streams Were ‘Fraudulent' George Clooney Says It Was a ‘Mistake' for Kamala Harris to Replace Joe Biden in Election While Gilligan is experimenting with a new sci-fi concept in Pluribus, he's in an industry where an older trope of the genre — the robots coming for us — has somehow become a depressing reality. “If you really want to wake me in a cold sweat at three in the morning, AI is the stick to poke me with,” he says. “But then some deeper part of me says, ‘Human beings are always going to want stories created by other human beings. Hollywood's obsession with IP — and the impossibility of anyone without Gilligan's track record being allowed to make something this big that's not based on a comic book or video game — feels like its own existential threat to him.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ince 2018, Russell Simmons has been living the life of a well-heeled holy man primarily in Bali, cultivating an aesthetic that falls somewhere between Eat, Pray, Love and alternative-medicine practitioner. Calling himself a yogi and professing wellness expertise — he has been promoting his 2015 vegan cookbook on Instagram — the Def Jam Recordings co-founder posted an exuberant selfie with a group of apparent religious pilgrims earlier this year, with the caption: “The goal is self discovery when one knows the self she/he makes life a moving prayer.… he should practice living in prayer ❤️ and one day in this lifetime or the next all suffering stops…” This introspection has also served as a business opportunity: Simmons is a founder and investor in the Gdas Bali Health and Wellness Resort, “the destination for devotional and wellness practitioners,” he wrote on Instagram. His Instagram account is filled with dedications to his family, yoga mentors, and old-school rapper friends — “It has probably been at least one year since I missed 8 am meditation,” he wrote in August — with Simmons noting recently that “Govinda das Ananda (god's blissful servant) was the name given to me by krishna,” and writing that one woman's introduction to yoga and meditation “inspire[s] me to keep serving.” However full the pioneering hip-hop mogul's island life might appear, his relocation came amid numerous sexual-misconduct allegations back in the United States. For more than a year, Simmons' continued residence in Bali dovetailed with allegations that he had yet to pay agreed-upon settlements to at least five women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Wendy Franco, Sil Lai Abrams, and Sherri Abernathy said in court papers filed in October 2024 that for more than a year, Simmons hadn't paid 2023 agreements of more than $3 million total. Franco has not publicly made claims against Simmons, but according to settlement paperwork filed in court, the settlement relates to alleged “physical injuries and sickness.” Documents filed in the legal proceedings also show that as of January 2025,, Simmons also owed a total of at least $8 million to three other accusers: Tina Klein-Baker, Toni Sallie, and Alexia Jones. These filings from earlier this year claimed that Simmons had paid only $220,000 total to them. (A firm spokesperson for Klein-Baker's lawyer, Kenya Davis of Boies Schiller Flexner, said that “at this stage of litigation, the attorneys and clients could not comment.” The attorney for Sallie and Jones declined to comment and declined to make them available for this article.) Rolling Stone sent a detailed list of questions related to the allegations of abuse and nonpayment to multiple attorneys representing Simmons. Simmons, through one of his attorneys, Imran Ansari, declined to comment. Two days after Rolling Stone sent Simmons questions for this article, a lawyer for Franco, Abrams, and Abernathy told Rolling Stone, “The matter has been resolved,” but declined to provide any additional details. Meanwhile, Simmons has gone on the attack in response to allegations against him. This summer, he filed a defamation suit against HBO and Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick, the filmmakers who produced On the Record, a 2020 documentary featuring interviews with several Simmons accusers. (Simmons' lawyer claimed “credible information, persuasive evidence, [and] witness statements” supporting Simmons were “disregarded” in the making of the film. Sean Combs Accused of Allegedly Assaulting Producer Following Masturbation Incident: Police Report Justin Baldoni Misses Deadline to Revive $400 Million Lawsuit Against Blake Lively Woman Allegedly Held Over Balcony by Sean Combs Serves Revised Complaint on Mogul in Jail The settlement papers with Franco, Abrams, and Abernathy do not detail specific accusations — like Franco's, the other two settlements reflect that “[t]he Settlement Amount constitutes a payment for damages for Claimant's alleged personal, physical injuries and sickness” — nor does Simmons admit wrongdoing in the settlements, which state that his payment does not imply “any admission of liability, fault, or wrongdoing.” Sallie and Jones' settlements also state that the agreements do not admit any liability of wrongdoing, nor specify exact allegations. His nonpayment, which spanned more than a year at the time of these interviews, felt like another trauma. “It was devastating,” Franco said in an April interview with Rolling Stone, before the resolution. “I just felt so stupid that I thought this person would follow through, that I thought that someone who could do what he did would turn around and acknowledge me and make some type of amends. The attorneys also said that Simmons is unable to pay a $15,000 penalty imposed by the court on his legal team for missing a scheduled court hearing. Dixon's lawyer, Kenya Davis, shot back that Simmons has money, urging a New York judge to ignore Simmons' “palpably false and self-serving claims of poverty.” Davis said that Simmons has a 75 percent stake in the Gdas resort and noted his “ongoing partnership with and ownership interest” in a Singapore-based talent agency. Resolved or not, Franco, Abrams, and Abernathy's years-long financial purgatory also exemplifies the unfulfilled promises of #MeToo. Women were encouraged to take action against men who had allegedly harmed them — often upending their lives in the process — only to find that the financial and emotional relief in coming forward might be ephemeral at best, nonexistent at worst. People can willingly enter into settlements — as Simmons did — but if they don't pay, enforcement of these agreements could spiral into a labyrinthine and prolonged legal fight. “It could be indefinite,” says Daniel Tabak, a partner at the New York law firm Cohen & Gresser who focuses on bankruptcy and was not involved in any Simmons cases. “There's no guarantee that [plaintiffs] will ever be able to collect.” Meanwhile, Simmons' financial liabilities don't seem to have impeded his movements. For years, Franco dealt with her pain personally and alone, and tried as best as she could to avoid thinking about Simmons. “I did not follow Russell Simmons in any way. While Franco declined to discuss the specifics of her allegations — “Ms. Franco is reluctant to elaborate on her claims against Mr. Simmons, given his penchant for litigation,” her attorney, Andrew Wilson of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel, tells Rolling Stone — she spoke openly prior to the resolution about the deep emotional toll of Simmons' apparent failure to pay the settlement. “A lot of people were writing about their experiences with powerful men having abused them,” Franco tells Rolling Stone. She had come across accounts of women speaking out against Simmons and had learned about a documentary on him while it was already in progress. “I missed my opportunity to be in this film because it had already been done,” Franco says. Franco contended with economic and family hardships from a young age. Franco says she was “pretty much living on my own by the age of 14” and staying with friends in New York. Franco kept up with Simmons' accusers through social media and discovered the Adult Survivors Act. The 2022 New York state law created a one-year window for adult survivors of sexual misconduct to file civil claims against their alleged abusers that otherwise would have exceeded the statute of limitations. I felt like a little bit of my history was validated. The settlement addressed a sense of dehumanization that had weighed on her for years. Abernathy — who as Sheri Sher was a founding member of the pioneering all-female hip-hop group Mercedes Ladies — describes a sense of empowerment in her decision to come forward. Abernathy's family, consisting of her mother and 10 siblings, constantly faced eviction in New York City. During one eviction, Abernathy recalls, city marshals took her composition book. She has previously said that Simmons attacked her one evening after luring her to his office under the false pretence of a business conversation. Abernathy alluded to the alleged rape in her 2008 autobiographical novel, Mercedes Ladies, but did not name Simmons despite her friends' encouragement to do so. She mulled naming him for four months, but ultimately decided against it. Following allegations against Harvey Weinstein that October, more women were coming forward with sexual misconduct claims against powerful men in the entertainment industry, including music, notably leading to the conviction of R&B star R. Kelly and sprawling allegations against Marilyn Manson. Less than two weeks later, screenwriter Jenny Lumet alleged in The Hollywood Reporter that Simmons sexually assaulted her. Three women, including Dixon, accused Simmons of rape in a Dec. 13, 2017, New York Times article. (Simmons is fighting Dixon's defamation suit, in part by insisting that his broad denials of sexual misconduct on a podcast did not directly name her.) “I never really expected that all these women would come out. Simmons has repeatedly denied the claims, saying in 2017 that “these horrific accusations have shocked me to my core, and all of my relations have been consensual.” He apologized in another statement for being “thoughtless and insensitive.” Weeks earlier, he said that he had “never committed any acts of aggression or violence in my life. I would never knowingly cause fear or harm to anyone.” The settlement “wasn't about money,” says Abernathy, noting how she didn't name Simmons despite her book coming out at the height of his fame. I always worked and kept paying my own way.” For Abernathy, who recently retired after working as a New York state court officer for 20 years, the settlement meant that Simmons was “being held to account for his actions.” Abrams, a writer and survivor advocate, says she was surprised that there might be any way to get justice. I always held reservations about it as a mechanism for justice, because I know how extensive sexual victimization is in our society,” she says. And one of the things we've learned from #MeToo was how widespread this issue is. It's not something that just happens on the fringes of society.” Abrams, who has said that she came from a chaotic home, told The Hollywood Reporter that she met Simmons in 1989. She had moved to New York City the prior year, and was working as a nightclub hostess. (She also worked as an executive assistant at Def Jam in 1992.) A few years after meeting Simmons, they had sex at various points. In 1994, Abrams saw Simmons for what she believed was a platonic meeting. She had previously told him she no longer wanted a sexual relationship and he agreed to that, according to her interview with The Hollywood Reporter. When they were out that night, Abrams has previously said, she was drinking alcohol while Simmons drank sparkling water, claiming he was sober. Abrams, who has said she was wavering in and out of consciousness, alleged that Simmons raped her despite her repeatedly saying no, and then directed her to leave his apartment because he was waiting for a romantic interest to call him. In November 2023, it seemed like things would finally come to a close for the three women. As part of these settlements, Simmons also signed paperwork attesting that he owed them the settlement money and confirming the payment deadline. Because these statements effectively validated the settlements, they should have expedited enforcement. “I was looking at my phone every day,” Franco says of waiting for Simmons' payment. When she spoke to her attorney at the deadline and learned that he hadn't paid, “it was devastating.” The burden of that limbo, she says, was “like an anchor.” “I thought, and I'm quite sure the rest of the girls thought, that Russell was going to keep [his promise].” When he delayed payment for more than a year, all the while leaning harder into his Zen vibe and luxe tropical lifestyle on social media, “it was just like living a nightmare over and over.” Last spring, Abernathy underwent brain surgery for an aneurysm and was “in the hospital fighting for my life.” As a result, Abernathy says she must avoid stress and keep her blood pressure down. She says she still decided to give it a shot, going into the negotiation “with an open mind.” She was baffled at Simmons' delay in upholding the agreement, saying the situation “just [kept] him tethered to all of us.” Abrams says the entire situation points “to the limitations that civil suits can have on actually bringing survivors some measure of justice that's intended.” The whole point of coming to a settlement is to avoid lengthy lawsuits and trials that can cost both sides more money. Most settlements include confidentiality clauses that not only conceal the settlement figure, but also bar anyone involved from publicly discussing it. But if the money isn't readily available, getting it becomes a challenging process. “A sophisticated, wealthy defendant often can hide their assets in a way that makes it very difficult for plaintiffs to collect,” explains Tabak, the Cohen & Gresser lawyer who helmed Hulk Hogan's legal team in Gawker's bankruptcy, resulting in a $31 million settlement. For years, Simmons has been fighting his ex-wife, Kimora Lee, in court over millions of dollars in Celsius energy drink shares that the feds want to seize following the money-laundering conspiracy conviction of Kimora's ex-husband Tim Leissner. (Through a rep, she declined to comment for this article.) How exactly the Celsius case will play out is unknown — a recent court filing suggests that Simmons and Kimora might have come to some sort of agreement that's yet to be finalized — but at the very least, Simmons has tens of millions on the line. Three of his accusers — Sallie, Baker, and Jones — have appeared in court filings as “interested parties” in the Celsius case, though it's unclear if any of the disputed money would go to his accusers. Wilson, Franco's attorney, has subpoenaed a business firm that works with Simmons for information about his finances. Wilson's firm also sent Aoki Lee a letter dated April 4 warning that if she spent any of her father's money, she could be on the hook for his nonpayment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Erika Kirk is bravely opening up in her first sit-down interview since the tragic assassination of her husband, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. In a recent clip ahead of the episode, Erika started to cry as she watched a video of her late husband. “This is the longest video I've watched of him. In the brief clip that was shared, Erika also expressed how Charlie Kirk was the love of her life. I just married the love of my life,” he told Watters. In a statement just two days after the assassination, Erika bravely spoke and revealed the sweet explanation she gave her daughter when she asked where her dad was. During the video, Erika also expressed how much family meant to her late husband. “Charlie always said that when he was gone, he wanted to be remembered for his courage and for his faith,” she said. “Most of all, Charlie loved his children, and he loved me with all of his heart.” Erika frequently shared rare moments with her children. In one touching post from Oct. 27, she shared a video of your daughter saying Charlie Kirk's name. She wrote a heartfelt message with the video. “[H]er…saying your name, as she witnesses all you've built and continue to build, proves that love never dies, just changes form. This is her legacy also,” Erika wrote. She continued, “And as she grows up and continues to say your name, I'll be reminding her that each time Heaven leans in to listen.” Thirty days after Charlie's passing, Erika shared how it has been since the tragic event. “There is no linear blueprint for grief,” she began the lengthy statement. But love doesn't ask to be healed. The former Miss Arizona stated that she will carry Charlie's memory with her forever. “I carry my Charlie in every breath, in every ache, and in every quiet act of day to day living as I attempt to relearn what that rhythm will be,” she continued.

I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!” John Oliver to Host Comic Relief Live in New York Honoring Trevor Noah and Kristin Lemkau On Sunday's Last Week Tonight, host John Oliver echoed critics of the president, noting: “That is pretty tone-deaf. Added Oliver: “It is odd to be posting bathroom remodel photos when so many are legitimately concerned about getting the government open again.” The government shutdown, which started Oct. 1, will break a record for the longest shutdown if it continues until Tuesday. Oliver previously weighed in on that project after photos surfaced of the construction: “Those images are distressing, especially when you know it's all to build a giant ballroom in a style best described as ‘Med Spa Versailles.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From the moment I saw Rachel Sennott make holding a bagel with disquieting anger in Emma Seligman's Shiva Baby feel like both a setup and punchline, I haven't been able to shake off what the eventual star of Bodies Bodies Bodies, Bottoms, and, yes, The Idol could do for a wry laugh. With her deadpan humor and penchant for embodying messy young women who are their own worst enemies, she's concocted a fitting love letter to this aggressively sunny city that opens with the most L.A. thing you can think of: an earthquake. We learn plenty about this junior manager in this opening sequence: Maia may be unable to think outside of herself, but she's a pragmatist to a fault: “If we're gonna die, I just wanna come,” she tells him when he begins worrying this might be the big quake everyone in L.A. is always waiting on. Maia, as we learn, is at a crossroads. She's turning 27, arguably a terrifying age for someone who's still trying to make her own mark in Los Angeles after leaving New York City behind a few years back. Thankfully, Dylan knows how best to navigate his girlfriend spiraling, redirecting her to focus on how skinny she looks now and her achievements at work. But first—and because this is a decidedly L.A. show—Maia has to go walking with her friends around the reservoir. Said pals are Charlie (Jordan Firstman, playing an L.A. Jordan Firstman-type gay) and Alani (True Whitaker, portraying your quintessential L.A. astrology girlie) who are stuck in what has to be the most 21st century discussion you can imagine: Should you block or mute a friend (or frenemy) you've had a fallen out with? There are clear pros and cons, especially because the person in question (Maia's old friend Tallulah) lives an extremely online life, what with being an influencer who once went viral for taking the subway in just a bikini (in a video that Maia took, no less). There's clearly bad blood, some money owed, and plenty of hurt feelings. It makes sense Maia would choose to just block her and avoid getting angry seeing how well Tallulah is still doing back in NYC, booking ad campaigns and clearly living it up. Right now, she's stuck barely mustering enough courage at her job to ask her boss  (a fabulous Leighton Meester as Alyssa, who's getting her nails done while meeting with Maia) for a promotion. Presented with the Kafkaesque L.A. conundrum of “you can't really become a manager unless you have experience being a manager,” Maia is quick on her feet. To Tallulah Steele, who's been doing great lately. Only her ruse is foiled when Alyssa, looking at Tallulah's Instagram, realizes she's not following Maia and, seeing her phone ring (“Maybe: State Farm”), insists she has to get it and that they'll follow up later. The day is clearly not going how Maia envisioned it. Tallulah, who may well be a human hurricane. You immediately understand why Maia would equally love and loathe her. And she just doesn't have time for this at the moment. But Tallulah, who obviously got into an altercation at the airport when she left her bag on the plane and dared to go back (and still found time to steal tiny airport liquor bottles in the process—yes, she's that kind of mess) is elated to see Maia, at the apartment the two of them were once supposed to share had Tallulah gone through with their OG plan years ago to move together to L.A. Despite some protesting, Maia tries to make the most of it (watching Sennott calculate as Maia how best to still appear cool to Tallulah while also showing how incensed she is at the whole thing is just a thing of beauty) and eventually gets roped into going out for the night. Where Maia's efforts go unnoticed, it seems Tallulah just skates on without any problems whatsoever. And that's how the two eventually get way too drunk, waking up hungover the next day and arriving late at Alani's, where Maia's birthday celebrations were to begin. Except that's all too boring for Tallulah: Why not go to the beach? No matter, after donning one of Alani's swimsuits, Tallulah's convinced that's what they should do. It's all too much for Maia, who has become a guest star in her own birthday and just bails and says she'll meet them for dinner. What follows is arguably the show's essence in a montage: set to Randy Newman's “I Love L.A.,” we get to see Alani and Tallulah have a fabulous day in Los Angeles (driving, walking around Erewhon, flashing the Scientology building on Fountain, thrift shopping—and yes, going to the beach) all while Maia is stuck trying to get her dinner reservation changed. And it all comes together at Maia's dinner, which turns out to be a surprise party of sorts (courtesy of Tallulah lying about it being her birthday, thus getting herself a suite and a cake with her name on it in exchange for a few Insta posts). This all drives Maia a bit insane and leads to the Tallulah vs Maia fight the episode was building toward: “L.A. is hard for a lot of people,” Maia insists, embittered. (The scene, shot in a bathroom and increasingly giving us close-ups of Sennott and A'zion, is proof that Lorene Scafaria is a great director, understanding how best to capture the oppressive intimacy that exists between these two lifelong friends.) What if she stays and has Maia become her manager? What if they enjoy the cake together and relish dancing with the stripper they got for the party who soon enough is dancing up on Tallulah, all while Maia takes what I have to imagine will soon become incriminating pictures of an up-and-coming L.A. starlet? And I cannot wait to see how it all unfolds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He's an impulsive square with a hair-trigger temper, a destructive need for recognition and attention, and, most dangerous of all, unfettered internet access. We're compelled by Ron's quest to find order and logic in a disorderly and illogical universe, a trait he shares with other characters who've seen through the matrix and attempted to awaken all the sleepers around them. But it's shouldering a lot of plot, too, delivering Ron to a grandiose conclusion about what Tecca is hiding (opioids in the chairs). Meanwhile, we see a map of how we got to this point with glimpses from six and five years in the past, when Barb and Ron each, as mentioned, quit their jobs to pursue their dreams. We already know what he wanted to do, but now we get to see just how spectacularly his plans for a Jeep-adventure business imploded. But I feel like if this is The Chair Company capitalizing on the length of its episodes and first season in order to flesh out its characters, then Ron using a spreadsheet to assemble his Pepe Silvia board illustrates just as much about him and his personality as viewing excerpts from his business' collapse. And so the question “Is Ron seeing connections that aren't there?” runs headlong into the question “Is it enjoyable to know this much about what makes Ron tick?” At least his drunk declaration about showing the kids “that you don't have to settle—you can do what you love” grounds his actions in some sincerity. Natalie certainly does, with the episode's final flashback showing us what Ron looked like from his daughter's POV five years ago (read: bad times at the Trosper house). But it sets up a tricky balance for The Chair Company to maintain: to keep us laughing at Ron's outlandish behavior even though we know the concerns his family has about it and the all-too-human motivations behind it. Whatever happens after this week's episode, there's bound to be a tinge of tragicomedy. Fortunately, there are still heavy doses of comedy comedy in “Bahld Harmon Birthplace (Disputed).” “That's really bizarre,” Ron remarks a couple of times while he sifts through the dirt he and Mike have gathered on Tecca. But his day-to-day life is plenty bizarre to begin with, punctuated by co-workers popping into his office to fret about the “treat” their boss has planned for later in the week (“Do you think it's going to be like a dessert or like a book?”) and a future daughter-in-law whose current work assignment involves making Wendy's new Almond Pimento Burger look photogenic. I can totally picture the goateed tuba mascot for Miss Maddy's Beignets causing trouble for Tim Robinson in an I Think You Should Leave sketch. It's another game of proportionality, each little nuisance engineered for a big Robinson blow-up. A fake out later in the episode, blinding police lights, handheld cinematography, and some ominous clanging (plus, naturally, Robinson shouting at the top of his lungs) combine to create a sense of peril that's cleverly undercut by the reveal that the cops are there to collect a donation of one Big Green Egg. Whether the heat is coming from the shadowy forces of Tecca or an HR investigation that has now roped in an outside observer to Ron's interactions with Amanda, he can't help but take it personally. In an episode full of priceless Tim Robinson reactions, my favorite is Ron's disbelief at the titular Bahld Harmon beating him out for the second modeling job. And when pressed about a yearbook photo that seemingly shows that Ron and Amanda hung out in high school, his response suggests he's offended at HR impugning his campus social standing, not his sense of honesty. That spiel and its accompanying montage of chair-part inspection and zoomed-in web pages are kicked off by Natalie telling her father that she admires how he's supporting his wife while Barb courts investors for Everpump. And with a head full of half-baked ideas about hydraulic levers, Hungarian exports, and pharmaceutical-company boards of directors, he's about to make sure that they're not the only ones keeping tabs on Ron Trosper. Fortunately for Ron, Natalie's got an eye on him, too. As we learn from the “Bahld Harmon Birthplace (Disputed)” flashbacks, she's been through this kind of thing before. But as we know from The Chair Company's present, she has no idea what her dad's conspiracy theory has dragged her into.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Being married to a Hallmark Channel superstar has its perks, but for singer-songwriter Jaymes Vaughan, who wed longtime Hallmark actor and producer Jonathan Bennett in 2022, it comes with some unique challenges, too. Vaughan has long been Bennett's biggest supporter, accompanying him to movie sets, on ad shoots, and at fan events. But in the spring of 2025, when filming began on the second season of “Finding Mr. Christmas” — the search for Hallmark's next leading man, co-created and hosted by Bennett — Vaughan indvertently landed his riskiest and funniest supporting role yet. Proving he'll do just about anything for his hubby, the assignment meant Vaughan wound up in all kinds of precarious situations, from hanging upside down in mid-air to sliding down a Crisco-covered hill. Ahead of the new season of “Finding Mr. Christmas,” airing Monday nights on Hallmark Channel, Bennett told EntertainmentNow that he was pumped to up the ante on each physical challenge that the 10 contestants faced, including a photo shoot that required the hunks to be suspended in mid-air, which is part of the new season's hilarious second episode, airing on November 3. “Like three or four days before filming, we have to test every challenge to make sure it works,” Bennett told EntertainmentNow. “I can't test it because, God forbid, something would happen to my face or I get hurt and can't film the show.” “Well, if you look at our guys,” Bennett explained, “they're all like 225 pounds of muscle and, you know, Davey and Drake are six-four. In the November 3 episode, the remaining nine contestants are each assigned to portray a different member of Santa's reindeers — complete with brown leather pants, evergreen vests over shirtless chests (of course!) and antlers — while being hoisted in mid-air by a crane. With Bennett and fellow Hallmark stars Melissa Peterman and guest judge Heather Hemmens watching their every move, the contestants have to strike a pose for two celebrity photographers snapping away. “Everybody's standing around watching me, and I looked a little ridiculous the first time I went up,” Vaughan laughed about testing the “Reindeer Games” challenge. “The way they had put the harness on at first, you would completely just fall forward, no matter what you did,” he continued. “And, you know, the guys are gonna want to flex their abs up there. So you knew it was gonna be difficult for the guys, but doable.” “I couldn't do it,” Vaughan told EntertainmentNow. “I spent 15 minutes on it trying to get up the thing. Think about it, your feet are covered in Crisco. And all of the producers are standing there watching. Okay, that's too long, we have to use less grease! “You know, we have these crazy ideas for the challenges,” Bennett continued, “but we don't know what's really going to happen until we actually build the challenge and Jaymes goes through it.” Vaughan finally figured out a way to make it up the hill, so producers knew that they could move forward with the challenge. But just as hard, they later realized, was how long it took to get all of the grease off afterwards in the shower. “It literally took 30 minutes to get all that off,” Vaughan marveled. You're covered in Crisco and baby oil or whatever it was. The next episode of “Finding Mr. Christmas” airs on November 3 at 8 p.m. Eastern time, and will be available to stream on Hallmark+ the following day. Featuring many of Hallmark's top stars helping Bennett and Peterman judge the competition as they face acting and physical challenges, the goal is to find the network's next leading man, who will appear in a 2025 Countdown to Christmas movie.
