Oops, something went wrong

IREN

Shares of IREN surged to a record high Monday after the Australian Bitcoin miner and data center company said it inked a $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft.

IREN is also spending $5.8 billion to purchase Nvidia chips from Dell Technologies.

IREN (IREN) shares jumped to an all-time high Monday after the Australian Bitcoin miner and data center company said it inked a $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft (MSFT).

Shares of IREN were up over 8% near $66 in recent trading after reaching an intraday high of $75.73 earlier in the session. Shares of Microsoft were little changed.

The company said the deal would give Microsoft access to Nvidia (NVDA) chips in its data centers over five years. IREN also said it struck a deal to purchase related Nvidia chips and ancillary equipment from Dell Technologies (DELL) for about $5.8 billion.

IREN said it plans to pay for all the capital expenditures involved by “a combination of existing cash, customer prepayments, operating cashflows and additional financing initiatives.”

IREN, like some other Bitcoin miners, has pivoted to focus more of its business on providing AI infrastructure to capitalize on the boom in demand for computing.

Co-founder and CEO Daniel Roberts said that the Microsoft agreement represents “another major step forward for IREN as we continue to expand large-scale GPU deployments across our 3GW secured power portfolio in North America.”

With Monday's gains, IREN shares are up close to 600% for 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As major altcoins cool off, traders are hunting for strength. If you're watching SUI and SOL, you should be looking at $TAP, the crypto presale, which is already up by 114% from its initial price. Over the past week, SUI has dropped 13.28%, sliding from around $2.65 to $2.30. Solana has also softened, down roughly 7.1% to about $189, as technical indicators signal more short-term pressure. Both tokens seem under pressure as trading volumes ease and investors take profits after months of strong gains. It looks like traders are moving away from these overextended major tokens and shifting their focus toward newer opportunities with higher potential upside. The Linear Regression Curve (LRC) overlay on Solana's chart confirms a weakening trend, showing price drifting beneath the regression midline, a technical sign that momentum is softening and sellers are regaining control. While these top-tier altcoins cool off, one project is defying gravity — Digitap, a fintech token blending crypto with real-world financial services, is surging ahead. Digitap, a revolutionary unified money app blending crypto and fiat, is proving that real-world traction can move markets just as quickly as technical indicators. Unlike typical crypto startups, Digitap's ecosystem allows users to hold, spend, and transfer both fiat and digital currencies seamlessly, with an integrated Visa crypto card on the way. Such milestones are typically reached after a token's launch, yet Digitap has already delivered, positioning $TAP as the best crypto to buy now for investors seeking tangible utility. This fusion of live fintech adoption and blockchain innovation gives $TAP a credibility edge over purely narrative-driven altcoins. Analysts are turning their attention to $TAP as its presale momentum and early fintech adoption suggest the kind of ground-floor entry that could underpin the project's ambitious goals. This success has clearly drawn attention, as the current stage (which opened only a few days ago) is already 62% sold out. With the current presale round already more than halfway sold, Digitap's phased approach has established a clear upward trajectory in both price and investor engagement. SUI's 13% drawdown and SOL's 7% dip highlight a broader correction phase across Layer-1 ecosystems, whereas $TAP's presale rise of 114% suggests the beginning of a sustained upward trajectory. As 2026 approaches, Digitap's combination of live fintech operations and transparent tokenomics could position it among the top altcoins to buy before listing, outperforming speculative projects struggling to deliver.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PORTO, Portugal / Wilmington, DE , Nov.  03, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Naoris Protocol, the first in production quantum-resistant blockchain and cybersecurity mesh architecture, has announced that Maria Lobanova, the company's Chief Marketing Officer, is set to speak at the upcoming Blockchain Futurist Conference in Miami, Florida, on Wednesday November 5th. Lobanova joins the likes of Eric Trump, Tristan Thompson, Iggy Azalea and a wide range of prominent blockchain leaders set to speak at the event, which brings together innovators, investors and technologists active in Web3, tokenisation and digital-asset ecosystems. The session will explore how today's builders are turning ambitious blockchain ideas into real-world products that solve tangible problems. Maria Lobanova, a seasoned crypto PR and marketing strategist, media contributor, and founder of Interstellar Digital, recently joined Naoris Protocol as Chief Marketing Officer. “The Blockchain Futurist Conference is an ideal platform for us to show how cybersecurity underpins the next generation of finance, from tokenised assets to derivatives, and why banks, funds and ecosystems must build on a unified foundation to realise Web3's potential.” Naoris Protocol leadership recently attended the Milken Institute Global Investors' Symposium in Mexico City, which brought together senior executives, policymakers and investors, providing a unique platform for Naoris to showcase its quantum-resilient infrastructure, and engage with institutional investors and strategic partners exploring emerging digital asset classes and cybersecurity in the tokenised economy. Naoris also recently announced the launch of Naoris Ventures, a dedicated venture arm driving the adoption of decentralized, post-quantum security infrastructure across critical global systems. Naoris Ventures will accelerate initiatives that strengthen resilience, trust, and efficiency in an increasingly automated and interconnected world, with a view to partnering with visionary founders building solutions that secure the foundations of the next technological era. Last month Naoris was also cited in a research submission to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the reference model for quantum-resistant blockchain infrastructure in its Post-Quantum Financial Infrastructure Framework (PQFIF). Within this framework, Naoris Protocol is recognized as a proven, evidence-based implementation model for industry-wide adoption. Earlier this year Naoris raised $3 million in a strategic funding round led by Mason Labs, with participation from Tim Draper, Frekaz Group, Level One Robotics and Tradecraft Capital. To learn more about Naoris Protocol, users can visit https://www.naorisprotocol.com/ Operating beneath blockchain layers 0 to 3 as a Sub-Zero Layer, it integrates with existing EVM chains, nodes, bridges, dApps, enterprise systems, and IoT devices without requiring hard forks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Local news reports said that Zhao was suggesting the development of an organization called “Bereket Bank” that would focus on digital assets and not be owned by the government or a family. Banks should collaborate with crypto in general, but I don't want to run one”. Zhao's statement emphasizes his broader push for integrating cryptocurrencies into regular finance without having to personally run any operations. Zhao's explanation follows a visit to Kyrgyzstan earlier this month that garnered significant attention. He also met with Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov during his visit, which demonstrated the country's openness to new ideas in blockchain technology. The government said it would launch its national stablecoin, KGST, constructed on the BNB Chain, which is Binance's own blockchain, just a few days after Zhao's meetings. To make these efforts even stronger, the government announced intentions to create a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that would be used for government payments. In a recent X post, Zhao personally talked about these improvements and praised Kyrgyzstan's forward-thinking approach to digital money. At the same time, Zhao said that Binance Academy would work with ten of Kyrgyzstan's top colleges. The goal of these agreements is to include blockchain education in school curricula so that the next generation may learn how to use virtual assets and decentralized technologies. These kinds of actions have clearly led people to believe that Zhao has more power, which could make them think his advice is actually about commercial deals. Kyrgyzstan is still working on improving the rules for digital assets, even with all these new ideas. Lawmakers are discussing amendments to the “On Virtual Assets” bill that would establish a state-backed crypto reserve. This structure would enhance control and mitigate risks as the sector continues to grow rapidly. Instead, a new body selected by the president will be in charge. The bill is still waiting for final approval, and the organization has not yet been named, but these measures show that Kyrgyzstan is committed to creating a safe, unified system for managing virtual assets. Zhao's denial serves as a reminder of the fine line between being an advisor and an entrepreneur as Central Asia becomes a centre for crypto adoption.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Series A Variable Rate Perpetual Preferred Stock, dubbed SATA, aims to pay an initial 12% annual dividend, paid monthly in cash. Strive currently holds just under 6,000 BTC, valued at roughly $637 million at current prices, an amount that will rise to roughly 11,000 coins should it complete its all-stock merger with Semler Scientific (SMLR). A nearly unrelenting sell-off in its common stock since completing a SPAC deal several weeks ago, has left Strive trading at a discount to the value of the bitcoin on its balance sheet (an mNAV of below 1). Thus, issuing common stock for continued bitcoin purchases would be highly dilutive to existing shareholders. The move to instead issue preferred stock follows the footsteps of pioneering bitcoin treasury firm Strategy, which began issuing various classes of preferred shares to broaden its options to raise capital for BTC purchases. Strive said it plans to maintain SATA's trading range between $95 and $105 per share by adjusting dividend rates within set limits. A $12 per share dividend reserve will be set aside to cover the first year of distributions. ASST shares are lower by 2.3% on Monday alongside a 4% slide in the price of bitcoin to $106,000.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home » News » New Crypto ICO to Watch: SpacePay Could Change Real-World Payments Patrick Johnson is a seasoned crypto journalist and analyst with a sharp eye for emerging trends in blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 innovation. A London startup called SpacePay might finally be the one to make it happen. The company is building a simple way for people to spend digital currencies in physical stores without any extra hardware or confusion. It works on existing Android payment terminals, so merchants do not need to buy new machines. A simple software update turns the device into one that can process crypto payments. People can pay through more than 325 different crypto wallets, from MetaMask to Trust Wallet and many others. On the other side, shop owners get their money right away in their local currency, without stressing over sudden changes in crypto prices. SpacePay takes only 0.5% per transaction, compared with the 2% to 4% that card companies usually charge. For a small business, that saving can quickly turn into extra breathing room each month. The platform uses bank-grade encryption and constant monitoring to detect suspicious activity in real time. It gives both buyers and sellers confidence that each transaction is safe from fraud. Merchants see transactions appear in their system as they normally would. There is no need to understand blockchain or learn new tools. The platform also shields them from price volatility by converting crypto into their chosen currency automatically. This combination of accessibility, security, and speed gives SpacePay a clear utility. Businesses can accept crypto customers without taking any financial risk. Customers can spend their digital assets without going through exchanges or waiting for confirmations that take minutes. It feels normal and reliable, which is exactly what mainstream adoption needs. Out of 34 billion total tokens, most go toward the public sale, growth, partnerships, and rewards. The team kept only a small portion, which shows they're focused on long-term goals rather than quick gains. People who hold the tokens can join community votes, earn loyalty rewards, and try out new features before they're released to everyone else. There is also a plan for revenue sharing, where part of the transaction income goes back to token holders. Investors can take part in the presale using cryptocurrencies such as ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, USDT, and USDC, or even through bank cards. The company launched its SpacePay One Testnet, an early version of its payment API that allows developers and merchants to test how the system works. Early users can try out payments, watch how fast the funds settle, and see crypto turn into regular money in real time. SpacePay combines real-world usability, low fees, and a live product, which sets it apart from many token projects that only exist on paper. So far, SpacePay has pulled in more than $1.4 million, built support for hundreds of wallets, and launched a working testnet – solid signs that things are moving forward. Looking ahead, SpacePay's focus on keeping things easy to use and reliable might help it stand apart in a market that's full of talk but short on real results. If paying with crypto ever becomes as normal as tapping a card, this project could play a big part in getting there. According to an official press release, this new phase...

As liquidity returns, the timing is perfect for Bitcoin Hyper as it continues to gain traction, securing $25.6 million in presale funding while advancing development of what it calls the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its design introduces a two-layer architecture: an execution layer powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for high-speed, low-cost transactions, and a settlement layer anchored to the Bitcoin network for finality and security, now reinforced by the project's newly detailed security framework that ensures integrity across both layers. For now, there's still time to secure HYPER at $0.013215 per token. 🚨 The FED just cut interest rates and officially ended Quantitative Tightening. The operation was designed to ease short-term funding stress among banks and stabilize overnight lending rates, which had started to rise as reserves in the system tightened. By adding cash, the Fed ensured banks could continue meeting daily funding needs without disrupting broader credit markets. For Bitcoin (BTC), moves like this have historically marked the start of a liquidity window, i.e. periods when central bank support coincides with renewed market risk appetite. Each time the Fed has shifted from tightening to stabilizing liquidity, Bitcoin has typically responded with stronger inflows and higher volatility to the upside. With liquidity flowing back into markets, Bitcoin Hyper is pressing ahead with development, refining the architecture designed to make Bitcoin more than a passive store of value. The project is now focused on strengthening its dual-layer framework, where the SVM handles execution speed and scalability, while Bitcoin anchors settlement and finality. The team's latest update places stronger emphasis on security integrity, ensuring that every state change within the network remains verifiable against Bitcoin's base layer. In practice, this means transactions execute at Solana-level speed but ultimately settle on Bitcoin, combining performance with immutability. Developers can use familiar SVM tools to deploy DeFi, gaming, and other high-throughput applications – all within Bitcoin's security umbrella. This phase also introduces new operational safeguards, including transparent sequencing, reproducible builds, and community-led verification, designed to make every component auditable and tamper-resistant. Each enhancement reinforces Bitcoin Hyper's guiding principle: scalability should never come at the expense of trust. Overall, Bitcoin Hyper marks the point where Bitcoin shifts from being stored to being used, which creates an ecosystem where BTC becomes the medium of exchange powering applications in DeFi, gaming, and real-world use cases, rather than sitting idle in wallets. To participate in the presale, visit the Bitcoin Hyper website and purchase HYPER using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card. HYPER is already listed under Best Wallet's Upcoming Tokens section, making it easy to buy, track, and claim once live.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brazilian financial giant Banco Inter and Chainlink have completed a blockchain-based pilot that enabled the central banks of Brazil and Hong Kong to settle a cross-border trade transaction in real time using digital currencies and smart contracts. It linked Brazil's Drex network with Hong Kong's Ensemble platform, overseen by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Chainlink's infrastructure provided the connection between the two systems, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk, allowing funds and asset records to move across jurisdictions within a single automated workflow. “By leveraging Chainlink to connect the BCB, the HKMA, and trade finance platforms, we're building a more connected financial ecosystem that has the ability to underpin the future of global trade,” said Bruno Grossi, Head of Digital Assets at Banco Inter. The pilot featured both delivery-versus-payment (DvP) and payment-versus-payment (PvP) model tests. These mechanisms allow for the simultaneous transfer of goods and payments, reducing settlement risk. The system also supported conditional and installment-based payments, such as releasing funds when a specific part of the trade process is confirmed. Supporting organizations included Standard Chartered, the Global Shipping Business Network (GSBN), and 7COMm. GSBN's platform handled updates to the electronic bill of lading (eBL) as part of the payment process. By removing manual processes and improving coordination across platforms, the solution could reduce costs for banks and exporters, especially smaller firms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The market capitalization of privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies rose by about 80% over the past week to briefly surpass $24 billion earlier on Monday before retracing 2.9% to $23.7 billion at the time of writing, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. The privacy coin rally occurred despite a wider crypto market downturn, which saw the total crypto market cap decline by 3.7% over the past week, from $3.96 trillion to $3.81 trillion, signaling increasing investor demand for financial privacy. Privacy coins such as Zcash and Monero XMRUSD obscure sender, receiver and transaction details, offering greater anonymity than pseudonymous cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTCUSD. “Privacy is increasingly viewed as a necessity rather than a feature,” Jake Kennis, senior research analyst at Nansen, told Cointelegraph. Kennis said the expansion of Zcash's shielded pool and improvements in its technology, including the Zashi wallet for shielded transfers and Solana integration, are making privacy transactions more accessible. Zcash's fixed supply of 21 million coins, its proof-of-work (PoW) consensus model and its privacy setting based on zk-SNARK technology position it as an “encrypted Bitcoin” for investors seeking private transactions, added Kennis. Zk-SNARKs are cryptographic primitives that can sever any tractable piece of data between two parties over a public blockchain network, aiming to strengthen digital privacy. Arthur Hayes tips $10,000 ZEC tokens before Zcash hits eight-year high Zcash rallied from $272 to a peak of $355 in the hours after Hayes's bullish prediction on Sunday, Cointelegraph reported.

Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley recently took to X to claim that within the next 12 months, every Wall Street institution will be doing something in crypto. Crypto is going to eat capital markets' – Hunter Horsley Almost every major bank, from Bank of America and BlackRock to Goldman Sachs and HSBC, is knee-deep in one or more crypto-related endeavors, whether that's crypto trading and custody, crypto ETPs, crypto-enabled payments, or tokenization. Especially considering that DeFi currently represents less than half a percent of traditional finance's scope. That said, it's worth noting that these crypto-related investment products are still relatively new, and it's only fair to give them time to mature rather than immediately comparing them to TradFi. What's more, a recent Bloomberg report revealed that JP Morgan is all set to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum as loan collateral. This would offer billion-dollar investment parties more flexible financing options, allowing them to retain their crypto holdings and avoid triggering taxable events. And then there's BlackRock, one of the biggest asset-management companies in the world, which now boasts over $87B in Bitcoin ETF assets and more than $10B in Ether ETFs – proving that crypto is indeed the next big investment opportunity. Don't want to miss the crypto gold rush? Below are three top altcoins to buy right now. It'll also enable developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts directly on Bitcoin. So, get ready to access DeFi trading apps, DAOs, governance, lending, staking, and gaming on Bitcoin, all thanks to Bitcoin Hyper. Furthermore, a decentralized canonical bridge will facilitate seamless interaction between Bitcoin's Layer-1 and Hyper's Layer-2 networks. Simply put, it'll convert your original Bitcoin into wrapped, Layer 2-compatible tokens. The project is currently in presale, meaning right now you can buy Bitcoin Hyper for just $0.013215 each – and stake it for 46% APY. And holding onto your tokens until 2026 could earn you a handsome 1,400% ROI, with the token projected to potentially reach $0.20 according to our $HYPER price prediction. Right now, traditional crypto mining is not only super expensive – with high GPU, electricity, and maintenance costs – but also highly technical, requiring detailed knowledge to set up and operate. Second, mining on PEPENODE is set to be simple yet engaging. The only challenge lies in experimenting with different combinations of mining nodes, as each will have unique characteristics and compatibilities. The dashboard will include familiar elements such as hashrate and other key performance metrics. Check out our step-by-step guide on how to buy $PEPENODE. And according to our $PEPENODE price prediction, if you catch the trend early and get in now, you could potentially see a 542% ROI by the end of 2026. Comedian ($BAN) launched in October last year and rode the Q4 boom to shoot up over 3,000% in less than a month. Nearly 12 months later, the token now appears ready for another major rally. It's currently finding support on a key upward-sloping trendline – the same one that triggered a 1,000% rally back in March this year. However, with a strong resistance line overhead, its upside potential will depend on whether it can successfully break past that resistance. But if $BAN manages to break beyond that line – which is highly likely given that it has tested it four times already (and as we know, the more times a resistance is tested, the weaker it gets) – then we could see another 2024-style rally. Join the meme coin mania – buy $BAN on MEXC today. Disclaimer: Kindly do thorough first-hand research before investing, as crypto is highly volatile.

HSBC CEO Georges Elhedery told the audience that three days earlier HSBC had exchanged interoperable tokenized deposits with Standard Chartered in Hong Kong. Standard Chartered's CEO Bill Winters was upbeat about blockchain. He said “pretty much all transactions will settle on blockchains eventually and that all money will be digital. Think about what that means. A complete rewiring of the financial system.” However, exactly how that will play out remains unclear, so there is a need for the experimentation that is happening in Hong Kong. From an international perspective, he observed that Hong Kong Dollar tokenized deposits and HKD stablecoins could become “a really interesting … medium of exchange for international trade”. That's partly because it is linked to the US dollar.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump says he does not know who Changpeng Zhao is, despite pardoning the cryptocurrency multi-billionaire last month. Zhao, who is also known as "CZ", pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering in 2023. He served four months in prison and agreed to step down as the chief executive of Binance, the crypto exchange he co-founded. His companies have partnered with firms linked to Trump on new digital-currency projects including Dominari Holdings, where his sons sit on the board of advisers and which is based in Trump Tower. The host of 60 Minutes, Norah O'Donnell, asked Trump why he pardoned Zhao even though government prosecutors had said he caused "significant harm to US national security." I don't know who he is," the president said. Trump added that he did not recall meeting Zhao and had "no idea who he is", only that he had been told that the businessman was a victim of a "witch hunt" by the administration of former US President Joe Biden. The president's pardon lifts restrictions that had stopped Zhao from running financial ventures, but it is unclear whether it changes his standing with US regulators or his role at Binance. "This was an overly prosecuted case by the Biden administration," she said, adding that the case had been "thoroughly reviewed". "So the president wants to correct this overreach of the Biden administration's misjustice and he exercised his constitutional authority to do so." The Trump administration previously halted a fraud case against crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, after his investments in the Trump family's crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. In May, it was announced that a stablecoin launched by World Liberty Financial would be used by an Abu Dhabi firm for a $2bn (£1.52bn) investment in Binance. Trump has also pardoned founders of the crypto exchange BitMEX, who faced charges related to money laundering, and Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road, the dark web marketplace known as a place for drug trade. One in eight Americans receive a food assistance programme called Snap, which has gone unfunded since Saturday. Left-wing candidate Zohran Mamdani is leading many opinion polls in Tuesday's mayoral race. The US president says his threat is over killings of Christians - though experts say there is no evidence they are disproportionately targeted. The actor - a prominent Democratic fundraiser - also says he has no regrets about calling for Biden to quit the US presidential race.</p>
