                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta on Monday announced an update to Facebook Groups that will allow admins to make their previously private groups public, without compromising the privacy of their existing members. This update will allow Facebook Groups to expand their reach without having to start a public group from scratch or exposing their members' past posts. After the update, all past group content — including posts, comments, and reactions — will only be visible to members who were in the group before the conversion, as well as to admins and moderators. After the conversion to public, new posts, comments, and reactions will be visible to anyone, including those who aren't on Facebook, as with any other public group. This could also help Facebook's content be more easily indexed by search engines like Google, which can then surface these groups in their search results for related queries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, there's nothing wrong with a little rudeness in the right context. If an openly hostile person is wasting your time on social media by asking easily researched questions, I think you should go ahead and enjoy a little passive aggression (as a treat). In more personal contexts, though, using Let Me Google That For You states clearly that you don't respect the person you gave the link to, and that their question is a waste of your time. If someone from your workplace or your personal life is asking you a question, it's because they want your specific input, so it's better to just give the answer—ideally with context only you can provide—than it is to send a link to a Google search results page. Telling someone to Google something can be funny and satisfying, but it's not helpful. I'd put copy-pasting or screenshotting a conversation with ChatGPT, Claude, or any other AI agent in the same category: not helpful and kind of rude. Developer Alex Martsinovich touched on this a while ago in a blog post called it's rude to show AI output to people: “Be polite, and don't send humans AI text,” he writes. “My own take on AI etiquette is that AI output can only be relayed if it's either adopted as your own or there is explicit consent from the receiving party.” I think this is a pretty good framework for AI etiquette. If someone asks you a question, when they could have asked the machine instead, it's because they wanted your perspective. The internet exists, at least in theory, so that humans can connect with each other, and so that we can benefit from each other's knowledge. Responding to a question with AI output ignores this dynamic, especially if you don't say that's what you're doing. Again: There are situations where you may want to be rude. But there's another reason sharing AI output is kind of rude: it could be flat out wrong. While models are getting better all the time, they still make (occasionally hilarious) mistakes. Sharing the output of a large language model in conversations, without checking it yourself for accuracy, means you could potentially be sharing misinformation. None of this is to say that AI isn't useful, or that you can't use it to answer questions people ask. I ask for an overview, sure, but I also ask for articles and studies to read on a subject. Then I read those sources myself in order to decide whether the AI's summary of the subject matter is accurate or not. I'll likely even follow up with a few of the people involved. I, as a journalist, consider this doing my due diligence. If an editor asks me a question about a statement in an article I don't just ask ChatGPT. I'm sure your profession has a similar level of due diligence. AI can be an amazing starting point for research, but you have more to offer than a starting point.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google announced on Monday that its Chrome browser can now fill in your passport, driver's license, vehicle registration, and more as part of its auto-fill feature. The addition expands Chrome's existing ability to automatically fill in your addresses, passwords, and payment information. Desktop users who have enhanced autofill enabled will see their passport and driver's license number, vehicle information — like their license plate or VIN — and more automatically filled in on web pages when they're prompted to enter them. Google says Chrome can now also better understand complex forms and varied formatting requirements, which will improve accuracy across the web. The tech giant notes that Chrome only saves autofill data when you give it permission to do so and that the browser will protect this information through encryption. Additionally, before Chrome fills in saved information on your behalf, it will ask you to confirm. These new updates are available globally in all languages starting Monday. Other smaller features that have launched on Chrome recently include a new tool that automatically disables browser notifications for the websites you haven't interacted with recently, along with a feature that makes it easier to switch between work and personal Google accounts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The IP firm claims AMD's stacked cache relies on its patented bonding methods. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Adeia has filed a pair of patent infringement lawsuits against AMD in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, claiming that AMD's chips incorporate patented innovations covered by its hybrid bonding IP portfolio. The company says ten patents are at issue — seven covering hybrid bonding and three tied to process nodes used in advanced logic and memory manufacturing. The litigation, announced November 3, follows what Adeia describes as years of failed licensing talks. Hybrid bonding technology sits at the heart of AMD's 3D V-Cache design, the feature that gives Ryzen X3D processors their gaming advantage and server-class cache density. Instead of solder bumps, it fuses copper and dielectric surfaces directly between dies, creating a near-monolithic connection at micron-scale pitch. That allows a 64MB slab of SRAM to be stacked on each Zen compute die without overwhelming its thermal or electrical limits. The technique is widely understood to use TSMC's SoIC process family, a form of hybrid bonding that enables ultra-dense 3D integration. The company now argues AMD's products make “extensive use” of the same concepts, asserting that its patented work has “greatly contributed” to AMD's success. Hybrid bonding could be the foundation for the next phase of chip scaling, as performance gains shift from transistor density to vertical integration. Few expect any near-term disruption to AMD's products, since injunctions in patent cases of this kind are rarely granted under post-eBay v. MercExchange precedent. AMD and its foundry partners are almost certain to challenge the patents through inter partes review at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, arguing that the asserted claims are either too broad or already covered by TSMC's process IP.

A negotiated settlement remains the most likely outcome, but the ruling could influence how every hybrid-bonded processor, from Ryzen to Intel's Foveros Direct, is valued in future licensing deals.

Keen to hear your point of view! The alternative is seeing fewer candidates (because you can't have engineers do non-stop interviews) or just filtering heavily based on CVs. Which as yanyu says is a signal the company isn't "willing to spend the effort, time, and money to provide a good recruiting process, [which is] a huge red flag for the kind of candidates you want and the kind of employee experience you provide".Which circles around and creates even more incentive for good candidates not to participate.There's no doubt a market on both sides for hiring mediocre candidates.

This kind of thing is just one more step in the direction of marginalizing people who are already struggling to find work. In an already broken hiring system, these approaches to "save engineering time" or "drive a more efficient hiring process" exacerbate the divide between those who have jobs and those who are desperate to get a fair shot, and that's what feels truly dehumanizing. The technical screening call typically happens after an initial screening chat with HR or the hiring manager. The tech screening interview comes in after that. A few years ago I was screening candidates over a 30-minute live coding interview covering pretty day to day stuff. I can't tell you how many times they seemed very stressed simply because they had to code in a live interview setting knowing someone is actively watching what they are doing.Now compare that to a 20-minute screening interview where most of that pressure is gone. You can do it whenever you want to.That is my rationale behind it, thinking both as an applicant and as a hiring manager.Why do you think this leads to more wasted time? You can do it whenever you want to.That is my rationale behind it, thinking both as an applicant and as a hiring manager.Why do you think this leads to more wasted time? That is my rationale behind it, thinking both as an applicant and as a hiring manager.Why do you think this leads to more wasted time? Why do you think this leads to more wasted time? Also, your 20 vs 30 minute calculation ignores that companies are incentivized to conduct more screening tests if it becomes practically free for them. So if instead of 10 screening calls they do 16 tests for one position, that's already more time being wasted, even if the tests are 1/3 shorter. And realistically, the number will shoot up much more. And I think screening more is not inherently a problem. Imagine they turned down the dial on their CV filters and had more applicants do a technical screen - wouldn't that give more applicants an opportunity to shine? In most cases it unfortunately is a numbers game. They'll keep running screenings after they've got someone they're almost sure they are going to hire, because if the deal falls through its better to have candidates in the pipeline.They'll run screenings before they bother to evaluate if they're even interested in a candidates skill set, because you've made it cheaper to filter out candidates for lack of technical skills than lack of job fit. (And no forcing them to meet the candidate once before running this tool will not change the fact that they will do this)And so on and so forth. Which is ironically why using this tool would filter the best candidates from the hiring pipeline while simultaneously making life worse for everyone who isn't one of the best candidates and who does have to put up with many companies wasting their time to get a single job offer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle venture firm Founders' Co-op unveiled its sixth fund — $50 million, matching the size of its previous fund — to back another batch of early-stage tech startups. Chris DeVore, founding managing partner at Founders' Co-op, said about 80–90% of investments will go to Pacific Northwest founders, typically at the pre-product or pre-revenue stage. Founded in 2008, Founders' Co-op was an early backer of billion-dollar companies such as Remitly, Outreach, and Auth0. The firm is sticking to its core strategy of backing ambitious technical founding teams in its backyard and helping them build companies that go on to raise capital elsewhere. He added, in reference to the fund size: “It's not bigger, because as they say in venture, ‘your fund size is your strategy. It does not invest in specific verticals, instead placing more weight on entrepreneurs. Founders' Co-op is now based inside Foundations, the new hub for Seattle-area entrepreneurs founded last year by Aviel Ginzburg, general partner at Founders' Co-op. “Foundations is Aviel's love-letter to the local founder community — so it's not a fund project — but by making Seattle a better place to be a founder, and helping the strongest and most committed founders connect and share with each other, it has absolutely put compelling new investment opportunities in our path,” DeVore told GeekWire. Asked this morning if the firm is still bullish on Seattle, DeVore said: “like you wouldn't believe.” Some of the firm's more recent investments include land use data startup Aarden AI, business automation AI company Logic, and internal help desk startup Ravenna. DeVore said one team “particularly worth watching at the moment” is RowZero, a Seattle startup that sells spreadsheet software and raised $10 million in a seed round earlier this year. DeVore previously led the Techstars Seattle accelerator but stepped down in 2019 to focus on Founders' Co-op full time. Ginzburg, a Simply Measured co-founder who joined the firm in 2015 and became general partner in 2018, was managing director of Amazon's Alexa Accelerator from 2017 to 2020. Other Seattle-area firms raising new funds include Ascend, Flying Fish, and Graham & Walker. Longtime firm Madrona raised $770 million for its new funds earlier this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>RDSEED failures are incorrectly being flagged as correct, leading to potentially predictable encryption keys being generated by the random number generator. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. AMD has confirmed the existence of RDSEED failure on CPUs based on its latest Zen 5 architecture, a critical security vulnerability in its hardware-based random number generator. AMD is labeling the fault "AMD-SB-7055" and classifying it as a high-severity issue. This is a critical issue for cryptography applications that rely on RDSEED's random number generation capabilities to provide fully unpredictable cryptography keys. If RDSEED fails, applications using it are at risk of attacks if the failure leads to a character pattern that is predictable. RDSEED is one of two random key generation systems available on modern CPUs (including Intel chips). The issue was not only the same as what AMD confirmed above, but was reliably reproducible by hammering RDSEED with one CPU thread and another thread "collectively eating and hammering on ~90% of memory..." A few days later, an updated Linux patch was posted that would disable RDSEED on all Zen 5 chips to stop the security vulnerability. This isn't the first time RDSEED has proven problematic on Zen-based processors. Cyan Skillfish, AMD's Zen 2-based APUs, also suffered from a similar (but different) RDSEED failure that also forced the Linux community to disable RDSEED functionality on those chips. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Thankfully, AMD will have AGESA microcode updates out soon to rectify this issue across all Zen 5 CPUs. In the meantime (for chips that don't have the mitigation yet), AMD recommends its users switch to its unaffected 64-bit form of RDSEED or switch to a software fallback.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Suleyman thinks that while AI can definitely get smart enough to reach some form of superintelligence, it is incapable of developing the human emotional experience that is necessary to reach consciousness. “Our physical experience of pain is something that makes us very sad and feel terrible, but the AI doesn't feel sad when it experiences ‘pain,'” Suleyman told CNBC. There are multiple scientific theories that try to describe what consciousness could be. According to one such theory, posited by famous philosopher John Searle who died last month, consciousness is a purely biological phenomenon that cannot be truly replicated by a computer. Many AI researchers, computer scientists and neuroscientists also subscribe to this belief. “Unfortunately, because the remarkable linguistic abilities of LLMs are increasingly capable of misleading people, people may attribute imaginary qualities to LLMs,” Polish researchers Andrzej Porebski and Yakub Figura wrote in a study published last week, titled “There is no such thing as conscious artificial intelligence.” “The arrival of Seemingly Conscious AI is inevitable and unwelcome. Instead, we need a vision for AI that can fulfill its potential as a helpful companion without falling prey to its illusions,” Suleyman wrote. He argues that AI cannot be conscious and the illusion it gives of consciousness could trigger interactions that are “rich in feeling and experience,” a phenomenon that has been dubbed as “AI psychosis” in the cultural lexicon. There have been numerous high-profile incidents in the past year of AI-obsessions that drive users to fatal delusions, manic episodes and even suicide. With limited guardrails in place to protect vulnerable users, people are wholeheartedly believing that the AI chatbots they interact with almost every day are having a real, conscious experience. “Just as we should produce AI that prioritizes engagement with humans and real-world interactions in our physical and human world, we should build AI that only ever presents itself as an AI, that maximizes utility while minimizing markers of consciousness,” Suleyman wrote in the blog post. “We must build AI for people, not to be a digital person.” But because the nature of consciousness is still contested, some researchers are growing worried that the technological advancements in AI might outpace our understanding of how consciousness works. “If we become able to create consciousness – even accidentally – it would raise immense ethical challenges and even existential risk,” Belgian scientist Axel Cleeremans said last week, announcing a paper he co-wrote calling for consciousness research to become a scientific priority. Suleyman himself has been vocal about developing “humanist superintelligence” rather than god-like AI, even though he believes that superintelligence won't materialize any time within the next decade. This is what happens when you ignore hardware for years while dumping all your once-exclusive titles onto other platforms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ChatGPT maker OpenAI, exercising newfound freedom under its renegotiated Microsoft partnership, will expand its cloud footprint for training and running AI models to Amazon's infrastructure under a new seven-year, $38 billion agreement. The deal, announced Monday, positions Amazon as a major infrastructure provider for Microsoft's flagship AI partner, highlighting seemingly insatiable demand for computing power and increasingly complex alliances among big companies seeking to capitalize on AI. Under its new Amazon deal, OpenAI is slated to begin running AI workloads on Amazon Web Services' new EC2 UltraServers, which use hundreds of thousands of Nvidia GPUs. Amazon says the infrastructure will help to run ChatGPT and train future OpenAI models. “Our partnership with AWS strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.” In an interview with CNBC, Dave Brown, Amazon's vice president of compute and machine learning services, said the new agreement represents “completely separate capacity” that AWS is building out for OpenAI. Up to this point, OpenAI has relied almost exclusively on Microsoft Azure for the computing infrastructure behind its large language models. At the same time, OpenAI committed to purchase an additional $250 billion in Microsoft services. OpenAI's new $38 billion deal with Amazon builds on a relationship that began earlier this year, when Amazon added OpenAI's first open-weight models in five years to its Bedrock and SageMaker services. Released under an open-source license, those models weren't bound by OpenAI's exclusive API agreement with Microsoft, letting Amazon offer them on its platforms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The iPhone has a lot of settings to bolster your privacy. Apple, despite collecting a decent amount of your data, gives you more control over your privacy than your average gadget, mobile or not, but many of these settings are turned off by default. You can lock down your location sharing, app sharing, and targeted advertising, as well as enable features that will help you find your device if it's lost or stolen. If you have an older version of iOS, certain settings may be in a different location, but the majority of iPhones should have access to most (if not all) of these settings. Privacy is personal, so you shouldn't treat the settings I listed here as a checklist. Your tolerance for data collection and the individual apps you have installed will largely dictate what settings you need to change. And remember, there's some level of privacy you have to give up with any device connected to the internet, so although these settings will help your online privacy, they won't make you completely anonymous. There are a lot of reasons you'd want to share location data with an app—for example, when using Apple or Google Maps—but apps that don't need your location might still request it. Follow the same path of Settings, then Privacy & Security, but choose Location Services after. There, you'll find all of the apps that have access to location services, their individual settings, and the option to turn off location services altogether. I don't recommend doing that, but you can still clean things up. First, for any app that doesn't need a precise GPS signal (for instance, a retailer's app), turn off the Precise Location setting, which you can find by tapping into an app. Once that's done, choose System Services, which covers all of the functionality built into the iPhone that accesses location data. There are a lot of settings here you probably want to leave on, such as Setting Time Zone and Cell Network Search, but there are some you can take off. In the same Privacy & Security menu, just below the previous two settings, you'll see a list of apps. A great example is already set up on the iPhone. You'll see that the Focus app is shared with the Messages app, which is pretty useful to let your iMessage friends know that you need some time to focus. There's some app sharing you might want to turn off. For example, the Photos app is fully shared with Google Drive on my iPhone, but I don't use Google Drive for photos. There's a ton of information that travels along with photos—metadata like the date captured and location—that I'd rather not share. By default, the iPhone doesn't share a ton of data. In fact, most settings are turned off out of the box, but there are a few analytics you'll need to dig in and turn off manually. There, you'll find two settings: Analytics & Improvements and Apple Advertising. Apple Advertising is more focused on privacy than other platforms, blocking ads from tracking you across websites and services. You can turn off the Personalized Ads toggle. You'll still get ads, but they'll be generic. If you turn on Apple Advertising, you can tap into the Ad Targeting Information screen to see what data is shared, such as your birth year, zip code, and the categories for apps you have downloaded. This isn't really a setting, but the iPhone has built-in privacy reporting tools that can give you insight into what data apps are requesting and using. For Apple Intelligence, you'll see private compute requests and what data was shared with the request. Regardless, both of these reports are fairly technical, and they don't help your privacy; they just give you more information. Apple automatically stores and syncs anything you put in the Notes app through iCloud, so no, those random thoughts you jotted down five years ago aren't completely private. Thankfully, you can keep them private with an “On My iPhone” account, which, as the name suggests, doesn't sync your notes and keeps them local to your device. Just above it, you can also set a password if you want to encrypt and lock any highly sensitive notes. Remember, you won't be able to pull up these notes on another Apple device because they won't sync, and if you lose your iPhone, you may not be able to access your notes altogether without a recent backup. You can hold down on any app icon, select Edit Home Screen, and tap an app to hide it. You can also hold down and select Require Face ID to lock the app, meaning it'll require biometric authorization every time you open the app. Hold down on any photo in the Photos app and select Hide. The iPhone is pretty secure out of the box, and Apple courts users into leveraging its security features as you set up a new device. Many security settings will sacrifice privacy, and vice versa. But I've seen some misconceptions about how Face ID (and biometric authentication more broadly) works. Your fingerprint for Touch ID and images for Face ID are not sent to Apple, and they're generally more secure than a password or simple PIN. Instead, your fingerprint or face is used to generate an ID, which is encrypted and stored in Apple's Secure Enclave, locally on your device. You and I both know it—you should be using two-factor authentication (2FA). I hate typing in a code or pulling up a second device as much as the next person, but it's hard to overstate just how much more secure an account is with two authentication factors instead of one. Select Sign-In & Security, and then choose Two-Factor Authentication. When signing into your Apple account on another device, you can use any of the devices listed as your second factor, be it another Apple product or a text sent to a verified phone number. iCloud encrypts your data, but it doesn't use end-to-end encryption, at least by default. Out of the box, Apple manages your encryption keys, so it could, technically, decrypt the data you store in iCloud. Although that's unlikely, you can still set up end-to-end encryption and manage your own encryption keys with Advanced Data Protection. To turn it on, open Settings and select iCloud. Then, scroll down and select Advanced Data Protection. Apple won't be able to decrypt your data, so if you don't have any recovery options set up, you won't be able to decrypt or recover your data. Apple includes Stolen Device Protection with your iPhone, but it's turned off by default. This feature requires you to verify with Face ID or Touch ID when taking certain actions without a password to fall back on, and it enforces a security delay, where critical actions such as changing your Apple password are only possible after a one-hour delay. There are two forms of Stolen Device Protection. Note that if you choose the latter, you'll need to keep the Significant Locations & Routes setting mentioned earlier turned on. If you set up Stolen Device Protection to only work when you're away from familiar locations, it'll kick in automatically. However, Stolen Device Protection doesn't lock down everything about your iPhone. It crops up in certain situations, which Apple details on its support page. You often have to trade privacy for better security, and that's the case for both Stolen Device Protection and Apple's “Find My” feature. To make sure you have it on, open Settings, select your account at the top, and choose Find My. Make sure Find My iPhone is turned on. If you tap in, you can also turn on Send Last Location, which will update the location of your iPhone if it's about to die. Although you'll need to have location services running, Apple says that devices using iOS 17 and later don't need to share that location data. If you have sensitive information that could pop up in notifications, you can obfuscate how notifications appear while your iPhone is locked. If you have a particularly sensitive app—say, an encrypted messaging app—you can also customize individual app notifications on this screen. The iPhone provides a surprising number of privacy and security tools, from app privacy reports to a built-in password manager via the Passwords app. Although all of the apps I'm recommending here have paid options—and I recommend those paid plans—they all also have a free version if you don't have the money to spare. I'd be worried if a free VPN didn't impose any limitations, frankly. It's also one of the best VPNs for iPhone, mainly due to its excellent speed. Proton tops the charts in our speed tests, and although others, such as NordVPN, are close, Proton has maintained its lead across desktop and mobile. The iPhone has a VPN built in, but it's not the same thing as commercial VPNs as most people know them. Rather, it's a configuration tool if you want to set up your own VPN. Bitwarden ranks as the best password manager you can use, though Proton Pass takes a close second. Both offer free options, and they'll give you more flexibility when storing and sharing credentials compared to Apple's built-in Passwords app. Although Apple's Passwords app is plenty secure, it's limited. Third-party password managers let you store a wide range of data, too, from passwords and passkeys to encrypted documents and medical insurance. You've locked down your messages; now it's time for email. If you want end-to-end encryption for personal use, you'll need an encrypted email service like Proton Mail, which is my favorite option.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A corporate turnaround is the most difficult maneuver in business: invest heavily in the future while being judged quarter by quarter. Intel is now deep in that crucible, and for the first time in years, the pain is starting to look like progress. For Intel, this challenge now falls to its new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, who has taken the helm to execute the ambitious IDM 2.0 strategy architected by his predecessor, Pat Gelsinger. Intel beat expectations on revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share. The real story is that this is the fourth consecutive quarter of improved execution, proving the strategy isn't just a set of slides; it's a plan in motion under new, steady leadership. It is the necessary, painful, and deeply positive cost of investment. Let's talk about Intel this week, and we'll close with my Product of the Week: the Wonderfitter M9 Smart VR pistol. When Pat Gelsinger began this turnaround, Intel was a company that had lost its credibility. It had a long, painful history of missing deadlines, fumbling new process nodes, and losing its manufacturing crown to TSMC. Beating guidance on revenue, margin, and EPS for the fourth consecutive time is the most important signal Intel can send. It tells customers, partners, and investors that the operational chaos is over and the ship, under its new captain, remains steady. Without this disciplined execution, the entire long-term plan is just a fantasy. The government's support effectively makes Intel a strategic national asset, insulating its long-term plan from short-term market turbulence. Second, and perhaps more stunning, is the support from its competitors. Nvidia's recent investment in Intel, alongside others like SoftBank, is a massive vote of confidence. Nvidia is partnering with Intel to create a new class of x86 products for the AI era, and more importantly, it has signaled a strong interest in using Intel Foundry Services (IFS). Because Nvidia needs a viable alternative to TSMC. These moves are a smart financing hallmark of Tan's strategic playbook. By selling a majority stake in these entities, Intel raised billions in cash to fund the core fab build-out without taking on suffocating new debt, all while retaining valuable partnerships and ownership shares. The AI revolution is driving an insatiable, accelerating demand for computing power. Intel's Q3 report shows it's finally positioning itself to capture this wave from every possible angle. Every company racing to build a custom AI chip — be it Microsoft, Google, Amazon, or a new startup — needs someone to manufacture it. This is where the foundry strategy comes into full focus. The news that Intel's ambitious 18A process node is advancing as planned is critical because this technology will put Intel back in the lead over TSMC. The fact that Fab 52 in Arizona, where 18A will be manufactured, is now fully operational and on track to bring Panther Lake chips to market this year is the proof of execution investors have been waiting for. Intel's Q4 guidance illustrates the investing-in-a-turnaround paradox most clearly. The company guided its Gross Margin (GM) down sequentially, a fact that would normally send investors fleeing. Intel is prioritizing its limited wafer capacity for high-value, high-profit server chips over low-value, entry-level client parts. Ramping New Products: The guidance cites the “first shipments of Core Ultra 3.” Ramping a brand-new product on a new process is always expensive. Accounting Changes: The “Altera deconsolidation” (selling a majority stake) means Intel can no longer count Altera's high-margin revenue on its main balance sheet. This is a simple accounting change, not an operational failure. Intel is strategically prioritizing its most profitable products and eating the upfront costs of launching its next generation of chips — precisely what a company in a deep investment cycle is supposed to do. Intel's Q3 2025 report is one of the most significant and positive in years, precisely because it's not all rosy. It shows a company executing with discipline under its new leadership, providing the financial stability to fund its own rebirth. The strategy laid out by Pat Gelsinger was bold. However, strategy is nothing without execution and financial discipline. He is bringing a new level of financial and partnership-focused discipline to the fight. We can put on a headset and see astonishing, photorealistic worlds, but the moment we look down at our hands, the illusion shatters. We're holding two floating, lightweight plastic controllers that look and feel like video game toys. The new Wonderfitter M9 Smart VR Pistol — currently on sale for $229 — doesn't just chip away at this barrier; it shatters it with the cold, hard feel of machined metal. It's a stunning piece of hardware that shows us the real future of VR, even if its software is still racing to catch up. It's a 1:1-scale, CNC-machined aluminum replica of the legendary Beretta M9. The “wow factor” isn't just visual; it's visceral. The magazine release drops a weighted mag into your palm. This tactile feedback is what VR has been missing. Because it's a third-party accessory that “borrows” the tracking puck from a standard controller, the integration isn't always seamless. Out of the box, it may be supported only by a handful of dedicated simulation titles, such as Onward or Pavlov VR. For many other games, getting it to work requires diving into complex settings menus or using third-party configuration tools, which can be a massive headache for the average user. This software problem is solvable and, almost certainly, temporary. As high-fidelity accessories become more popular, game developers will be incentivized to add native support for them. We will see driver-level improvements and simpler setup wizards. Rob Enderle has been an ECT News Network columnist since 2003. He has an MBA in human resources, marketing and computer science.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Acolyte only lasted a single season, but fans still carry a torch for the late Star Wars spinoff. One element the show seemed eager to continue, and something a specific sect of fans were looking forward to, was the relationship between ex-Jedi Osha (Amandla Stenberg) and future Knight of Ren founder Qimir (Manny Jacinto). During a recent interview with TV Insider, he talked about Qimir and Osha's relationship—Oshamir, for short—being a dynamic that interested him to begin with. It's a weird thing: we have the big fight scenes and the origin stories of these heroes and whatnot, but they don't really have a relationship with other people.” “I'm incredibly proud of what we did in The Acolyte and I loved Qimir and Osha relationship, because we were taking it back to having a relationship in this big world,” he continued. We were taking it back to a relationship in this big world.” The lack of romances in blockbuster movies has long been a talking point, and Star Wars has been part of those conversations. Relationships and romance has always been a core part of the franchise, which Disney hasn't always been the best about accepting, much less portraying. Most romances in the franchise don't end well, but maybe summer 2026's YA romance book Eyes Like Stars from Ashley Poston will buck the trend. Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who. "BLACK", by David Productions, represents the apex of what 'Star Wars: Visions' should be: bold, stylistic, challenging, and thoroughly, dazzlingly new. The search for a primary writing system in 'Star Wars' has a history almost as old as the saga itself. Kyle Katarn's third-ever action figure—his first since 2009—will bring dark forces to your toy shelf next year.</p>
