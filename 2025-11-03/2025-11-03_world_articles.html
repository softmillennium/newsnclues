                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump has said he feels “very badly” for the British royal family after King Charles stripped his brother, Andrew, of his titles over the former prince's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the late, convicted sex offender. The ex-Duke of York, now known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, will also have to move out of his long-term residence at the Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate, Buckingham Palace announced on Thursday. Speaking to reporters onboard Air Force One on Sunday evening, Trump – who was friends with Epstein before winning his two US presidencies – was asked about King Charles's decision to strip Andrew of his peerages and titles. “It's a terrible thing that's happened to the family. Trump has frequently spoken of his admiration for Britain's royal family, including during his unprecedented second state visit to the UK in September. He hailed the so-called special relationship between the US and Britain as he paid a gushing tribute to King Charles. Before Trump was greeted by King Charles during September's visit, several images of the US president and Epstein were projected on to Windsor Castle, with an accompanying soundtrack questioning their relationship. Meanwhile, Mountbatten Windsor has been under renewed scrutiny over his ties to Epstein after the publication of newly released emails and a posthumous memoir by Giuffre, who died by suicide in April at the age of 41. In the book, she claimed she was forced to have sex with the former prince on three occasions, including when she was 17 and also during an orgy after being trafficked by Epstein. She claimed Mountbatten Windsor “believed that having sex with me was his birthright”. Mountbatten Windsor, 65, has always denied claims he had sex with Giuffre when she was 17. In the latest fallout from the scandal, the UK defence secretary, John Healey, said on Sunday that Mountbatten Windsor would be stripped of his last remaining naval title, which he was given in 2015. He was stripped of his other honorary military titles by his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, in 2022 after he was sued by Giuffre.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>•  Top business people and thought leaders from the worlds of politics, economics and fashion have gathered in London today for CNN International's first Global Perspectives live event, focused on Africa. • We've heard from WTO director general Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who called for “careful thinking” on tensions in Nigeria, after US President Donald Trump suggested the US may take military action there to protect the nation's Christians. Celebrated Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie gives a wonderful reading about the power of literature. We become alive in bodies that are not our own,” she said. A reminder that is needed now, in today's world, more than ever. “My mother, when I first moved to New York gave me the best advice of my life … Knowing that what I was about to approach was going to be the hardest thing I ever did in my life, she said, ‘Uzo – just work hard! We have to see sports as a business,” Ujiri told CNN's Eleni Giokos. We are so talented, it's crazy,” he added. “Pilots, chefs, artists, basketball players, soccer (players), accountants, everything you can think of — we are truly the most talented continent in the world. Nonkululeko Nyembezi, the chairperson of Standard Bank Group and co-chair of B20, a forum for the global business community, told CNN's Richard Quest that infrastructure is key to growing intra-Africa trade across the continent. “Even on the core infrastructure, what we have in Africa today is infrastructure that's designed from mine to port, because it was designed for export and for extraction industries,” she said. “We have to have a close relationship with the new regime,” he told CNN's Eleni Giokos, during a discussion on Africa's next generation of leaders. The relationship between tourism and conservation has always been difficult in Africa; the tourism industry provides jobs, but some argue that it can have a negative impact on local biodiversity. But conservationist Dr. Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka says tourists could be a “necessary evil” for environmental protection. “I saw the positive impact of tourism, which was very important for me as a vet student, as a scientist,” she told CNN's Larry Madowo. In the late 90s, Kalema-Zikusoka set up the first veterinary unit at the Uganda Wildlife Authority, before undertaking a zoological medical residency and masters in specialized veterinary medicine at North Carolina State University and North Carolina Zoological Park. “Humans have disturbed the wildlife so much,” she said. “I found out that the gorillas' habitat was really encroached.” Now, conservationists have found a “happy medium” between enabling conservation efforts, engaging with local communities and boosting the overall economy, added Kalema-Zikusoka. After speaking with Ozwald Boateng, Eva Omaghomi, founder of consultancy firm Forster Jones & Associates, hosted a panel on how Africa can reclaim global luxury. “We need to move from a continent that supplies the world with its finest materials to one that actually creates beauty and puts it out in the world as a finished product. Fashion designer Ozwald Boateng told Eva Omaghomi, founder of Forster Jones & Associates, that when he started out in the early 1980s in London, race was a barrier to entry, and he had learned through his childhood that he had to fight for his voice to be heard. When he was 18, he visited Savile Row, a London street known for its bespoke men's tailoring, and saw an opportunity: “The street was a bastion of British tradition, but it was dying. In 1995, Boateng opened his first retail store, in Savile Row, achieving two goals: firstly “a cultural point, from my own heritage — and I was saving something that was very important to be British.” Fast-forward to this year, and Boateng's shimmering designs for the Met Gala in New York — themed “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” — cemented his lasting style legacy. Dr. Anne-Marie Imafidon MBE, CEO and co-founder Stemettes, which promotes the inclusion of women and non-binary people in STEM industries (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), took to the stage alongside CNN's Zain Asher. “We're in the middle of a fourth industrial revolution,” says Imafidon, with so much exciting “untapped potential.” But more people need to be in the conversation and listened to, she adds. “It's about saying there's a whole population that's not represented in the way we built this technology,” Imafidon said. Gender inclusivity goes hand in hand with geography too, she said, adding, while referring to the continent: “Can you build something globally if it doesn't work for 54 countries?” A crop of African-founded financial technology (fintech) start-ups has risen over the past decade. Here, four leading industry figures told CNN's Richard Quest the key to unlocking a sustainable ecosystem for budding entrepreneurs lies in: Addressing funding gaps and skills shortages, improving intra-continental cohesion, and creating a fluid regulatory system to match an ever-evolving market. But that said, we're still behind.”Alex Okosi, managing director, Google Africa. But that said, we're still behind.”Olugbenga Agboola, co-founder and CEO, Flutterwave “Our experience is also, in some countries, the regulations were literally being written as we were talking to them because what we're doing is so new, and they needed to take some steps to think about what's actually happening.Lucy Liu, Co-founder and President, Airwallex. Next up, as part of “Africapitalism” and a New Era of Inclusive Finance, we're discussing “inclusive capitalism” – a term Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, conceded is “an oxymoron to most people today.” De Rothschild, founder and CEO of the Council for Inclusive Capitalism,  referred to warnings that disillusionment with capitalism is high among many demographics, including Gen Z. Reforms are needed, she argued, “because if capitalism doesn't work for everyone, the system of capitalism is going to go away.” “Africa,” de Rothschild said, “is a place that could test the contest between capitalism and socialism.” Fellow panelist Tony O. Elumelu, group chair of Heirs Holdings and founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation, said companies need both profit and purpose. His foundation identifies and invests in 3,000-5,000 young African entrepreneurs annually, he said. “It's been so wonderful to see how that music is traveling around the planet,” she told CNN's Larry Madowo. “I think people are starting to look at African artists in a different way. “I'm grateful for the extended visibility that those artists grant to so many others,” she said. In 2024, the Grammys added a new category – Best African Music Performance – to capture the multiplicity of sounds across a continent of 54 nations. However, Somi believes there is more work to be done. “I still think there's an opportunity to push against the monolith of African music,” she said. Born in Illinois to parents from Rwanda and Uganda, the vocalist is inspired by “being a child of immigrants.” “We always talk so much about telling our stories. During a lively panel here alongside Sanda Ojiambo, CEO and executive director, United Nations Global Compact and hosted by CNNs Jim Scuitto, Mo Ibrahim Foundation founder and chair Dr. Mo Ibrahim describes the new world disorder as a “wake up call.” “There's no crisis without a silver lining,” he said. “What's happening around the world is a call to action.” “Without peace you cannot have development,” Ibrahim added regarding the African continent, saying that conflict has never delivered for its people. In a region where internet use has skyrocketed over the past decade, Africa's largest internet provider is dedicated to involving Gen Z in digital transformation, according to Ebenezer Asante, the senior vice president of markets for MTN Group. Asante told CNN's Larry Madowo that cross-generational partnership is essential to growth in Africa. “We are getting to a space where, without a partnership, and working together — not only with our competitors, but also with other investors, with government, as well as multilateral agencies and development fund providers — we are simply not going to be able to cover the next one billion people.” We're required to bring the cost of deployment way lower than where it is today,” he said. “Why can't Africa feed itself when we have all this arable land?” Larry Madowo asks Dr. Florence Wambugu, CEO of Africa Harvest, Dr. Ismahane Elouafi, executive managing director of CGIAR and Sunny Verghese, co-founder and group CEO, Olam Group Limited. Elouafi said per hectare, Africa is producing 20-40% the yield of a highly developed nation. Maximizing agricultural efficiency on the continent could have wide-ranging impact. Africa, which contains more than 60 percent of the world's remaining uncultivated land, represents a huge opportunity. Ademola Adesina, the co-founder and president of digital infrastructure provider Sabi, told CNN's Richard Quest that Africa had in some ways “actually benefitted” from the tariffs imposed earlier this year by the Trump administration — because they have led to a more decentralized mineral supply chain.” “There's a requirement that some of these critical minerals come directly from Africa now and not go through the elephant in the room: China,” said Adesina. The CEO of DP World has highlighted how important African routes are to his company, one of the world's largest logistics firms. CNN's Jim Scuitto sat down with Professor Carlos Lopes of The University of Cape Town to discuss how Africa is responding to turbulent global economics and geopolitics. “Africa's agency has been on the rise,” said Lopes, regarding global relations. In the quest for influence, “Western countries are losing the game,” he argued, signposting Africa's increased ties with the Gulf states, Turkey and India – “as important as China was a decade ago.” Lopes said outside the continent, perceptions need to be recalibrated: “Africa is a net exporter of capital. This idea that we're being helped needs to be turned on its head.” CNN anchor and Chief National Security Analyst Jim Sciutto talks to Bissau-Guinean development economist Professor Carlos Lopes about how Africa can secure a lasting position of power amid a rapidly shifting global order.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump has baselessly asserted that other countries are testing weapons —  a claim contradicted by monitoring groups. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. This past week, President Donald Trump called on the Department of Defense (DOD) to restart nuclear weapons testing “immediately,” citing false claims about other countries' nuclear arsenals and testing. In a Truth Social post on Wednesday and an interview that aired on Sunday, Trump was vague regarding the extent of the future nuclear weapons testing, including whether he would push for actual nuclear explosions. This is false — Russia actually has the most nuclear weapons. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War [sic] to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,” Trump wrote. Despite Trump's suggestion that other countries are testing nuclear weapons, only one country, North Korea, has even tested such weapons in the 21st century. Indeed, most countries ended their nuclear weapons testing in the 1990s. Trump repeated these falsehoods in a “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday evening. “We're the only country that doesn't test,” Trump said. When host Norah O'Donnell attempted to correct him, Trump rejected the idea that he could be wrong, asserting that China and Russia both conduct nuclear weapons tests — despite the fact that international monitoring organizations would be aware of such tests and alert the public if they were taking place. O'Donnell suggested to Trump that he could be referring to a missile test that Russia conducted last week, which did not include an actual nuclear weapon but could potentially carry such an arsenal. “My understanding is what Russia did recently was test the delivery systems for nuclear weapons, essentially missiles,” O'Donnell told Trump. But the president continued to insist that other countries were doing broader tests of nuclear weapons. Political observers have noted that this isn't the first time Trump has struggled to accurately convey crucial details about nuclear weapons  — indeed, during the 2016 presidential campaign, he appeared to have no idea what the nuclear triad was. Any mention of nuclear weapons by leaders of the nine countries that have them — including the possibility of resuming testing — is closely watched, and could be followed by action from the remaining eight countries to increase production or ready their own military capabilities. Earlier on Sunday, Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright sought to assure Americans that Trump had not yet planned for nuclear weapons testing that would include explosions. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) recognized in a recent press release that Trump's statements on restarting nuclear weapons testing are “not clear” regarding whether he would pursue nuclear-explosive testing, but noted that many of the president's allies have suggested he should do so. The announcement from Trump last week is “a wake-up call that the threat of nuclear war is real and accelerating,” CND said, adding: With heightened tensions over Ukraine, it will further escalate this terrible conflict. Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative. But independent journalists at Truthout face mounting political suppression under Trump. He can be found on most social media platforms under the handle @thatchriswalker.

A group of residents from my neighborhood decided to go there and set up their tents, but Israeli forces stationed nearby opened direct fire on them, even though the area is located outside the Yellow Line. “I went with my brothers to check on the remains of our home, which I hadn't been allowed to reach for six months because Israeli forces were there,” my neighbor, Ahmed Matar, 36, said. “For a moment, I thought our area was safe since it lies outside the Yellow Line, but as soon as we arrived, a quadcopter began firing and dropping bombs randomly, and artillery shelling intensified. They have had enough of living in exile, far from the places where they were born and raised, confined to overcrowded camps that lack the basic necessities of life and privacy. “No place can ever replace the one where you were born … Every day, I dream of the moment I can return.” Our worst fear is that the “Yellow Line” might ultimately become a new border for Israel. “For two years, we lived in a small tent that my father set up on Al-Mawasi Beach.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Firefighters worked to rescue a worker trapped for hours beneath the rubble of a medieval tower that partly collapsed while under renovation in the heart of Italy's capital on Monday, critically injuring another worker. Firefighters faced a complex task as the structure continued to give way as they tried to get near the trapped worker through a first-floor window, forcing their retreat on telescopic aerial ladders in a cloud of smoke. Another approach on two ladders was also aborted, and a drone sent up in their stead. As dusk approached, firefighters lifted on a crane used giant tubes to suck rubble out of the second-floor window. Three workers were rescued unharmed after the initial midday collapse, said firefighter spokesperson Luca Cari. Italian media reported that another worker, age 64, was hospitalized in critical condition but there was no immediate update on his condition. No firefighters were injured in the ongoing operation. Rome's top law enforcement official, Prefect Lamberto Giannini, said there were “signs of life” from the trapped worker, and that firefighters had managed to give him some protective cover during an earlier rescue attempt. Giannini called the situation “very complex” and said that other equipment was being brought in. Hundreds of tourists had assembled to watch as firefighters used a mobile ladder to bring a stretcher to the upper level of the Torre dei Conti during the first rescue attempt. Suddenly, another part of the structure partially collapsed, sending up a cloud of debris and forcing firefighters to quickly descend on the ladder. Queen Paglinawan was working in a nearby gelato parlor when she heard the two loud noises from the town in quick succession. “I was working and then I heard something falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way,'' Paglinawan, 27, said as yet another collapse occurred in the background. Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri and Italian Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli were at the scene, but did not speak to reporters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Actor who said in 2015 that a Trump presidency would be ‘the end of the world' says celebrities make no difference to how people vote Jennifer Lawrence has said she no longer feels it appropriate to speak out against the Trump administration, lest she exacerbate unhelpful debate and further divisions. “During the first Trump administration, I felt like I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off. I'm just sharing my opinion on something that's going to add fuel to a fire that's ripping the country apart.” Raised by conservative Republicans in Kentucky, she voted for John McCain in 2008 before joining the Democratic party and saying she realised during Obama's administration that voting Republican was voting against her own rights as a woman. “The second term feels different,” said Lawrence of Trump's presidency. We knew what he did for four years. Lawrence is promoting Die, My Love, Lynne Ramsay's drama in which she plays a new mother who struggles with her mental health in rural Montana. What's happening is no less than a genocide and it's terrible.” She continued by saying that she was saddened by “the disrespect in the discourse of American politics right now and how that is going to be normalised to the kids right now. “Stay focused on who is responsible,” she said, in what many took to be a reference to the then-recent pledge signed by more than 4,000 entertainment industry figures to boycott Israeli film institutions. The actor, who won an Oscar aged 22 for her role in Silver Linings Playbook, is attracting awards attention for her performance in Die, My Love. Although Ramsay has rejected the story being interpreted as one of postpartum depression and psychosis, Lawrence said that she did relate to elements of her character's journey after the birth of her second son, soon after shooting ended. “It was fear about my child,” she said, “just picturing every worst-case scenario, and then doubting everything that I was doing. “It feels nice,” she said, of being forced to cast off vanity. But it doesn't keep me up at night.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil refineries and Western sanctions have significantly benefited top Western oil companies, Reuters reported on Nov. 3. Since July, Ukraine's drone strikes on Russian refineries and export terminals have cut Russia's average daily oil product exports by 500,000 barrels, according to energy analytics firm Kpler. Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) chief Vasyl Maliuk said on Oct. 31 that Ukrainian forces had conducted nearly 160 successful strikes on Russian oil extraction and refining facilities in 2025. This lifted global refining margins for Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, and TotalEnergies, which together produce more than 10% of the world's refined oil products, or about 11 million barrels per day. Exxon Mobil reported a 30% quarterly profit increase in its energy products division, reaching $1.84 billion, attributing the gains to "supply disruptions" in the global market. British oil and gas company BP, which will publish its quarterly results on Nov. 4, saw its profit margin rise by 33% in the same period. BP previously held nearly 20% of Russian energy giant Rosneft's shares. The U.S. imposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil on Oct. 22, freezing their U.S.-based assets and threatening secondary sanctions against foreign entities transacting with them. The European Union's July sanctions, which ban the supply of petroleum products made from Russian crude to Europe starting in January, have also strained Rosneft's operations, including at its Indian refinery that exported significant volumes to European markets. The development also follows Kyiv's intensified campaign against Russia's energy infrastructure. Ukrainian drones have struck at least 16 of Russia's 38 oil refineries since August 2025. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa, working there for two years from the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. The 7th Rapid Response Corps said that assault and special operations units blocked an effort to cut a supply route between Pokrovsk and nearby Rodynske.. After the invasion of Ukraine, most Western and Asian car manufacturers quit Russia, selling assets to local companies for symbolic sums while securing repurchase options in case of future reentry. An undisclosed number of missiles were delivered to replenish Ukraine's stockpiles ahead of winter, when Russia is expected to intensify its attacks, the source told Bloomberg. The Kremlin previously said that Putin is not expected to attend the event, which is scheduled to take place in Johannesburg between Nov. 22 and 23. The Saratov oil refinery in Russia was struck by drones on Nov. 3, according to the Astra Telegram channel, which cited open-source intelligence data. State-owned Chinese refiners, such as Sinopec and PetroChina Co., have canceled some Russian cargos, and smaller private refiners are also holding off on purchases, according to Bloomberg. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Nov. 2 that as of now, he is not planning to provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles. Ukrainian Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said on Nov. 2 that the strike would have "long-term consequences" for Russia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A medieval tower in the heart of Italy's capital, near the famous Roman Forum ruins, partially collapsed on Monday during renovations of the structure, critically injuring one worker and trapping another, authorities said. Hundreds of tourists watched as firefighters used a mobile ladder to bring a stretcher to the upper level of the Torre dei Conti to rescue the worker who remained trapped. During the rescue attempt, another part of the structure partially collapsed, sending up a cloud of debris and forcing firefighters to quickly retreat. Firefighter spokesman Luca Cari confirmed that the one remaining worker remained trapped hours after the initial collapse. He added that a rescued worker was being treated in critical condition and that another three workers were rescued unharmed. The initial collapse happened some time before noon, and did not appear to have involved any bystanders. Queen Paglinawan was working in a nearby gelato parlor when she heard the two loud noises from the town in quick succession. “I was working and then I heard some like falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way,” Paglinawan, 27, said as yet another collapse occurred in the background. “We were just at the Colosseum … and we were just walking to get some food. Tourist dies after falling from outer wall of Rome's Pantheon Four firefighters later approached the first-floor window on two mobile ladders, but were quickly pulled back when dust emerged. The Torre dei Conti was built in the 13th century by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his family. Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri and Italian Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli were at the scene, but declined to speak with reporters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hello, this is Jared Goyette from a sunny, brisk fall day in Kyiv on day 1,349 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. We are closely monitoring the situation in Pokrovsk, with reports of further deterioration in the city for Ukraine's embattled forces. Ukrainian forces said on Nov. 3 that they stopped a Russian attempt to advance north of Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in Donetsk Oblast, which is semi-circled by Russian forces and the site of fierce fighting. The 7th Rapid Response Corps of Ukraine's Air Assault Forces said in a statement that assault and special operations units blocked an effort to cut a supply route between Pokrovsk and nearby Rodynske, killing 19 Russian soldiers. “On Pokrovsk's eastern and southern perimeters, Russian forces have slowly crept forward in recent weeks, seizing roads, slowly strangling supply lines, and pressuring Ukrainian defenses,” reads a Nov. 3 report from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Strike drones from Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) destroyed Russian air defense equipment in Crimea overnight on Nov. 1, including a radar system of an S-400 air defense system, according to HUR. Ukraine has systematically targeted Russian air defense in Crimea since mid-2023. The last strike occurred on Oct. 29, when drones from the Special Operations Center “A” of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) destroyed a Pantsir-S2 self-propelled anti-aircraft system, valued at an estimated $20 million, along with two radar stations, in an attack that also targeted two oil depots, according to the SBU. The UK has transferred additional Storm Shadow cruise missiles to Ukraine, boosting Ukraine's long-range strike capability against targets deep inside Russia, Bloomberg reported Nov. 3, citing unnamed sources. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Nov. 2 that as of now, he is not planning to provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles. When asked by reporters if his administration is considering sending Kyiv Tomahawks, Trump responded: "No, not really… things can change but at this moment I'm not." At least six people have been killed and 30 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Nov. 3. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 115 out of the 138 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys launched by Russia overnight, as well as one out of the three Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, according to the Air Force. In the village of Raihorodok, a Russian strike injured one person, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks targeted 36 settlements, killing one person and injuring eight others over the past day, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a 55-year-old man was killed, and four people, including an 8-year-old girl, suffered injuries in an attack against the city of Pavlohrad on Nov. 2, Governor Vladyslav Haivanenko reported. Russian forces also attacked the regional center of Dnipro on Nov. 3, injuring a 37-year-old man, according to Haivanenko. In the Lebedyn community, two women suffered injuries. In Kharkiv Oblast, Russia targeted 13 settlements, injuring five people, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Russia has lost around 1,144,830 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Nov. 3. The number includes 1,160 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,321 tanks (+5), 23,531 (+6) armored fighting vehicles, 66,411 (+121) vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,207 (+45)  artillery systems, 1,534 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,235 air defense systems, 428 airplanes, 346 helicopters, 77,435 (+383) drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

Earlier, he worked as a digital editor/reporter at FOX 9 in Minneapolis and received the Minnesota SPJ's 2022 Peter S. Popovich Award.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President insists new trials will begin, but officials say US not capable of doing so The United States is not ready to restart nuclear weapons testing and risks losing ground to China and Russia if it pushes ahead with Donald Trump's plans, experts believe. Experts fear that in doing so, Mr Trump has fired the starting gun on a race Washington is ill-prepared to win, and that it could find itself matched or overtaken by Moscow and Beijing. Visitors to America's vast testing site in the Nevada desert said it is filled with equipment that is slowly rusting away, while former officials say it simply has not had the investment to match the president's ambitions. Now there are fears that Mr Trump has opened a “Pandora's Box” that has remained shut almost since the end of the Cold War. And he might not be prepared for what comes next. Some believe it was a case of nuclear sabre-rattling intended to intimidate the Chinese premier. Some think he was kicking off a nuclear arms race in earnest. Since 1992, the US, China and Russia abide by a moratorium on nuclear testing, although one US official suggested several years ago that Moscow could be conducting secret experiments. The situation resembles a Mexican stand-off, but with nuclear bombs instead of guns. Mr Trump's announcement could have been prompted by Moscow's claims to have tested nuclear-powered weapons, such as its “Poseidon” drone apparently capable of creating a radioactive tsunami, or “Skyfall” cruise missiles, said to have an effectively unlimited range. But this is different to detonating a nuclear warhead. And as we can see, this president is not,” said Daryl G Kimball, director of the Arms Control Association. Corey Hinderstein, a former senior NNSA official, wants the president to urgently clarify his announcement on Thursday. “It's one thing to fire the starting gun,” she said. Since 1945, Washington has detonated 1,149 nuclear devices compared to Russia's 969. Ms Hinderstein, who now works with the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace in Washington, DC, says the US has a much more sophisticated understanding of nuclear weapons because of those tests and there is no technical need for full-scale trials to ensure the reliability and safety of its existing weapons stockpile. The information it already has from earlier trials can be used in tandem with billion-dollar supercomputers at sites which simulate nuclear tests without the need for detonations. One such site is Los Alamos in New Mexico where Robert Oppenheimer led efforts to build a nuclear bomb during the Second World War. Starting a testing cascade where others would follow is actually giving a cheat code to our adversaries that they don't have.” Authorities could detonate a nuclear device underground within about 18 months if they did not have to collect any data: what one expert refers to as a “screw you nuclear test explosion”. Staffing issues at the NNSA exacerbated by Elon Musk's Doge cuts will scarcely speed up the process, which could be further delayed if Nevada politicians mount a legal fight to stop tests going ahead. “It doesn't look fancy and shiny,” said a former official. At the same time, satellite images appear to show that Russia and China have been upgrading their test sites at Novaya Zemlya and Lop Nur so they are ready to resume nuclear detonations. Mr Kimball expects they would probably be able to do so more rapidly than the US “because they have fewer safety and regulatory issues to deal with”. There is widespread bafflement about why Mr Trump should be the president to break a taboo observed by his predecessors since the days of George Bush Snr. Robert Peters, a research fellow with the foundation, told The Washington Post last week the US needed to “do something to demonstrate that we're not going to be intimidated or coerced by these autocrats in Beijing, Moscow and Pyongyang”. A years-long wait for tests was “unacceptable”, he said, suggesting the president could carry out a test above ground, which has not been done since the days of John F Kennedy and has been linked to increased cancer rates. Other experts hope the president misspoke or is indulging in characteristic brinkmanship, and that the Kremlinologists in China and Russia aren't taking him too literally. Either way, a nuclear arms race might already have begun.</p>

HANGZHOU /China/, November 3. /TASS/. Economic cooperation between Russia and China has been strengthening, despite global turbulence, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said at the 30th regular meeting of the Russian and Chinese heads of government.

"Despite turbulent global politics and world economy, cooperation between Russia and China has deepened. We have launched new large-scale projects, including in developing oil and gas fields, the production of high-tech equipment, cooperation in the energy field, peaceful nuclear energy, and space and Lunar exploration. We are implementing joint programs in aircraft-and car making, developing transport corridors, and we work in extreme Arctic conditions," he specified.

The Russian prime minister praised the 30 years of meetings between the two countries' heads of government as a reliable and stable aspect of Russia-China comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation. "As Russian President Vladimir Putin has stressed, Moscow and Beijing share a wide range of interests and hold a similar vision of fundamental issues," Mishustin said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump accused Russia, North Korea, China, Pakistan and other countries of secretly holding underground nuclear tests. "But they don't go and tell you about it. You don't necessarily know where they're testing. And Russia did make— a little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China— and China does test, and we're gonna test also," the US leader added as he stated that North Korea and Pakistan, too, have been testing. "We have the best [nuclear weapons], and I was the one that renovated them and built them during a four-year period [as a president]. And I hated to do it, because the destructive capability is something you don't even wanna talk about," the US leader explained. "And if we have 'em [nuclear arsenals], we have to test 'em, otherwise you don't really know how they're gonna work. And we don't wanna ever use them," Trump concluded. On October 29, Trump instructed the Pentagon to immediately resume nuclear weapons testing. He did not specify what type of tests he meant or whether they would involve detonating nuclear warheads.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. MICHAEL KOVRIG is Senior Adviser, Asia for the International Crisis Group. Most Pacific governments have leaned in to Beijing's offerings—seeking infrastructure and investment, as well as the leverage that Chinese ties give them with other partners. At the same time, they have worked to preserve their own autonomy and advance a “Blue Pacific” vision of a peaceful and cohesive regional order. But as China's influence deepens and the islands' democratic institutions come under growing pressure, that vision risks being eclipsed. Over time, it could split regional consensus, deprive Taiwan of diplomatic allies, and complicate Western deterrence in the Pacific. To counter this dynamic, both administrations began a reengagement with the region, and the Biden administration launched a government-wide Pacific Partnership Strategy and pledged $1 billion in assistance over ten years. Since then, however, the second Trump administration has taken steps that many Pacific leaders see as disregarding their countries' interests. But that will not be enough to counterbalance Beijing. Meanwhile, the United States has imposed across-the-board tariffs of ten to 15 percent on Pacific nations such as Fiji, Vanuatu, and Nauru. For now, the Pacific Islands have mostly sought to avoid explicit alignment with either China or the United States and its partners. The immediate reason was to avoid controversy over Taiwan's participation, which China opposes as part of a persistent campaign to deprive Taipei of diplomatic recognition and relevance. But a larger consideration was China's own expanding presence in the region, which has, in turn, encouraged the United States and other powers to treat the islands more as strategic assets than as sovereign partners. In a bid to manage this trend, the forum announced new rules on island partnerships with outside powers and made a formal declaration to keep the region free from militarization and external coercion. As they achieved independence or at least greater self-rule, they built a multilateral regional order centered on the Pacific Islands Forum, established in 1971 to coordinate policies and elevate Pacific voices. Over time, this cooperative framework helped the islands chart their own destinies, alongside broad partnerships with Western governments. After the Cold War ended, however, Western strategic interest in the islands waned: aid declined, diplomatic representation thinned, and high-level engagement became sporadic. Against this background, most Pacific Islands have welcomed China's emergence. Since then, China has shaped a Pacific strategy based on incrementally increasing its presence, influence, and pressure. President Xi Jinping personally signaled that the Pacific had become a priority with trips to Fiji in 2014 and Papua New Guinea in 2018. But China clearly has its own economic and military agenda, as well. Assessing the Pacific as relatively weakly contested, Beijing aims to become a maritime power (haiyang qiangguo) that can control the western Pacific, marginalize regional neighbors, and prevent the United States from acting as an offshore balancer that could deter it. So far, the PLA has not sought to establish actual military bases, which would undoubtedly draw countermeasures from the United States and other Western powers. By instead building infrastructure and leasing or investing in potential dual-use logistics facilities on the islands, China can acquire the footholds it needs more quietly, often with local buy-in. Thus far, Chinese actors have directed most attention to the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. China in this sense views the Pacific Islands as a network that can support its broader strategy across enormous ocean expanses. As Beijing sees it, the three island chains serve as springboards for Western military deployments, benchmarks of the PLA's own force projection, and concentric Western lines of defense and containment that China must break. Running from the north Pacific through Micronesia and Melanesia, this broad arc of countries and territories is where Western interests collide with China's emerging power projection across the Pacific. South Pacific sea-lanes that link Asia with Australia pass Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, making those countries strategically significant for Australia and potential pressure points for Beijing. For now, China is not directly asserting influence there, but signs of nascent Chinese interest in atolls such as Kanton, Kiritimati, and Hao suggest longer-term ambitions. In September, Beijing also showcased new hypersonic missiles that Chinese media claim can “break” the island chains. Both developments have heightened Pacific Island concerns that they could become U.S. staging bases—and, hence, Chinese targets. Since 2019, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and Nauru have switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, leaving only the Marshall Islands, Palau, and Tuvalu maintaining ties with Taipei, despite persistent Chinese pressure. At the Pacific edges of what Beijing's policymakers call China's greater periphery (da zhoubian), the PLA and China Coast Guard are also rapidly increasing surveillance, intelligence gathering, and force projection—often using “gray zone” tactics. In 2024, PLA Navy destroyers visited Vanuatu and Tonga, and in a rare missile test, the PLA Rocket Force sent an intercontinental ballistic missile into the South Pacific. Australian analysts see these as unsubtle demonstrations of China's growing capability to coerce Canberra. Pacific Island officials fret about a spiral of militarization, and with good reason. In a clash between China and Taiwan, for example, multiple war-gaming scenarios indicate the PLA could seek to thwart Western intervention by striking military targets, cutting undersea cables, and disrupting transportation along and between the island chains. Alongside its growing military presence in the region, Beijing has sought to become a preferred provider of internal security expertise, training, and equipment. China's Ministry of Public Security now works with police in Fiji, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu; PLA defense attachés offer similar assistance to the militaries of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Tonga. The China Coast Guard's recent registration of 26 ships with the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, an intergovernmental body that promotes sustainable fishing, underscores Beijing's aim to become a leading enforcer of the high seas. For now, Canberra still has the most officials working on Pacific countries and is their leading donor. All the Pacific Islands that have diplomatically recognized Beijing have also joined its Belt and Road Initiative, including most recently the Cook Islands, which signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement in February, rattling officials in New Zealand, its constitutional partner and strategic guarantor. These accords are weaving a new web of economic and political relationships and jolting traditional Western partners to shore up their own influence. Australia has responded with a slew of its own initiatives, including a landmark mutual defense treaty with Papua New Guinea signed in October. Australia's foreign minister, Penny Wong, says her country is in a permanent contest. Trade, financing, and development assistance now link most Pacific Islands to China. Some countries, such as Tonga, have become increasingly dependent on Chinese credit. Although some islanders and observers criticize Chinese loans and projects as unsuitable, unsustainable, or coming with hidden strings attached, the general view from most of these countries is that China delivers—typically more quickly and with less red tape than Western competitors. Yet these deals and projects often involve extensive corruption. In island after island, politicians, civil society representatives, journalists, and analysts allege that Chinese interests have used bribery and other unethical incentives. They report such methods as coercion, election interference, media manipulation, and use of proxies who are linked to organized crime networks or the Chinese Communist Party's United Front, an international network of the party that operates globally to capture foreign elites and shape narratives about China abroad. Although few cases have been proved in court, surveys indicate that many islanders believe corruption is widespread and safeguards are inadequate. Regional analysts also warn that China has been targeting island elites with lavish financial and political rewards for supporting its strategic preferences. To be fair, such support for China is at least partly motivated by frustration with Western partners for failing to deliver on climate financing and critical infrastructure. But it suggests how quickly China has gained sway. By now, many Pacific leaders understand what is at stake in China's bid to bring the region into its orbit. Despite its tangible benefits, engagement with Beijing is posing new threats to governance, political stability, environmental sustainability, national security, regional consensus—and potentially self-determination. The Pacific norms and institutions that hold elites accountable, ensure rule of law, and sustain independent news reporting all show signs of strain. The sheer disparity in scale with Beijing that the islands face—China's population is 1.4 billion compared with their combined 14 million—imposes an extreme imbalance of power. Pacific peoples insist that their islands are not just links in strategic chains and are making clear that they form a unique, self-governing community with a right to define its own vision and destiny. Yet in the face of China's ever-expanding influence, Pacific-led efforts will only succeed with steadfast support. One positive step would be for the U.S. Congress to adopt the Pacific Partnership Act, legislation that would mandate the administration to put forth a formal Pacific Islands strategy, which would likely facilitate increased and more predictable U.S. financing, deeper cooperation on maritime and security challenges, and better coordination with other partners. The United States can build a better model of engagement that recognizes the islands' own interests even as it enhances U.S. national security. It is also a cost-effective way for Washington and its allies to preserve the fragile balance that keeps the Pacific as peaceful as its name.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Toronto Blue Jays' gutting World Series Game 7 loss is vindication of the decision by executive chair Edward Rogers and chief executive officer Tony Staffieri to make sports a tentpole strategy at the telecom company. For even the most casual of fans, the Blue Jays' heady run through baseball's playoffs built a bond with both players such as Ernie Clement – the guy who sat beside you in Grade 10 chemistry – and a company that never stopped reminding viewers it is the “proud owner of Canada's team.” Going into this season, Rogers marketing research showed only 30 per cent of Canadians knew the company owned the Blue Jays. For a cellphone and cable operator plagued by perceptions it overcharges, an overachieving team became a heaven-sent branding opportunity. In an early-season break with precedent, Mr. Rogers and Mr. Staffieri got personally involved in negotiations that signed slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to a US$500-million contract extension. Rogers gets brand boost from Blue Jays' World Series run However, he is stepping up public appearances to burnish the company's brand. In this season's playoffs, Canada's team faced two showcase franchises, the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees. The Blue Jays pounded the Yankees and came within two home runs off hanging sliders of dispatching a supposedly unbeatable LA team. What is the Toronto Blue Jays' playoff run worth to Rogers? It speaks to competence at a family-controlled company that hasn't always been able to get out of its own way. Investors and lenders challenged Ted Rogers over the logic of sinking money into baseball as content for a fledgling sports TV channel. Fast forward 25 years, and soaring broadcast fees for must-see TV events such as the World Series have turned team owners from billionaires into multibillionaires. The Blue Jays are worth an estimated US$2.2-billion. Rogers signals it may wait to acquire final MLSE stake before seeking outside investors As Rogers prepares to take full control of Toronto's other marquee pro-sports franchises later this year by purchasing billionaire Larry Tanenbaum's 25-per-cent stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd., the company is riding a marketing and financial hot streak. If the past and future faces of Toronto sports ownership get it right, the transition from Mr. Tanenbaum to Edward Rogers as MLSE's leader will have all the drama of ordering a pizza. Rogers's entire sports and media division – which includes stakes in hockey's Maple Leafs and basketball‘s Raptors – is valued at $20-billion. The Blue Jays‘ run and massive valuation on Rogers's sports platform speak to a consistent approach to building a business, after leaders swung and missed on a few pitches. Ted Rogers always believed in big bets, financed with debt. After his death in 2008, the approach grew tentative. In 2012, CEO Nadir Mohamed teamed up with BCE Inc. BCE-T to acquire 75 per cent of MLSE. Buying out BCE earlier this year meant Rogers returned to a mindset of competing, not co-operating, with telecom rivals. Opinion: Rogers needs a private equity partner for sports, not an IPO spinout After Mr. Mohamed retired, Rogers looked to brash British telecom veteran Guy Laurence for leadership. Shortly after, Rogers wrote off the Vice partnership. Over the past three years, Mr. Staffieri paid down debt by raising capital from sophisticated investors such as Blackstone Inc. and pension plans. Last month, Rogers boosted forecast annual revenue from its media and sports platform by $100-million to $4-billion to reflect the deep playoff run.
