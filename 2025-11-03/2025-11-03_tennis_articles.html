                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Italian Lorenzo Musetti controls his own Nitto ATP Finals qualification destiny this week in Athens as the 2025 ATP Tour season enters the final week of the regular season. Musetti slipped outside the cut last week in Paris when Felix Auger-Aliassime moved to eighth by reaching the final. Should 23-year-old Musetti join new World No. 1 Sinner in Turin, it will be the first time that two Italians have qualified for the season finale, which this year offers more than $5 million to an undefeated champion. Musetti, who fell to countryman Lorenzo Sonego in his Paris opener, has a bye in the first round of the Vanda Pharmaceuticals Hellenic Championship in Athens. He will play the winner of veteran Swiss wild card Stan Wawrinka and Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp in the second round. Auger-Aliassime has withdrawn from this week's other ATP 250 in Metz. © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Only three women have repeated as the WTA Finals winner over the past quarter century. Coco Gauff, the defending champion here, is already discovering why. “I think, A, it's one of those tournaments you're not guaranteed a spot in every year,” Gauff explained before this year-end tournament began. “Some people win and aren't able to even qualify. B, the top eight in the world, it's very hard to I think win this tournament in general, let alone replicate it back-to-back years. I really just want to focus on my first match ahead. 2 Iga Swiatek -- to win the crown with a memorable third-set tiebreak over Zheng Qinwen. Her opening match on Sunday against fellow American and good friend Jessica Pegula did not go nearly as well. There were a raft of double faults and missed forehands and a frustration level that was increasingly evident. At one point, Pegula hit an awkward shot that, although it bounced within range, Gauff didn't even get off a proper swing at the ball. 3 seed faces possible elimination in a Tuesday match against No. “Yeah, every match here is tough,” Gauff said. “I played her in Wuhan, so I expect her to play differently than she did in that match. “After the [US] Open, I was done. It was a struggle for me to play Stuttgart and the other fall tournaments, even the year-end championship. And yet, Evert managed to win four WTA Finals singles titles, fourth on the all-time list, behind rival Martina Navratilova (8), Stefani Graf and Serena Williams (5 each). “But when you finally get there your level of energy is a little bit low. And then there is another reason, the biggest one: The closest Sabalenka's come was three years ago in Fort Worth when she lost a tight match in the final to Caroline Garcia. “It might just be [the season's] timing,” said Jason Stacy, Sabalenka's fitness coach. It's also about peaking at just the right time. No one, even Sabalenka, can be consistently dialed in over 10-plus months. Her tactical coach, Anton Dubrov, cited a different kind of timing. Maybe it's helpful for them because they're more fresh. “But then you have [Jasmine] Paolini and [Elena] Rybakina, who played the last couple of tournaments. It might be helpful because they're on a roll right now.” As the depth in women's tennis has improved, it's been increasingly difficult to repeat. It's difficult in any sport to finish the season with a brilliant burst two years in a row. Since 2015, no singles champion has managed to repeat. Three of them -- Dominika Cibulkova, Garbine Muguruza and Caroline Garcia -- failed to even qualify the following year. There were also extenuating circumstances: Williams was the World No. 1 in 2015 but shut it down after the US Open with an injury. 8 seed before falling to Ashleigh Barty 6-4, 6-3 in the final. “Only three players?” tournament director Muguruza asked, sounding slightly surprised. First you need to already qualify, then survive the round-robin format, not getting injured in these intense matches. “There is not one day that you can even relax a little bit. “It's really mentally tough knowing that every single match you have to be on your 100 percent, or at least 80 percent.” “There's so many ups and downs,” Evert said. “You can have a strong first half of the year and then it's hard to keep it up. “Skill-set-wise and talent-wise, it very often comes down to the mental part.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Janice Tjen, a rising tennis star from Indonesia, has made an impressive leap in the WTA rankings, reaching No. 53 after winning her first singles title at the Chennai Open. Tjen's inspiring journey serves as a reminder to young players to never lose hope in pursuing their dreams. On Monday, the 23-year-old from Indonesia moved to No. 53 in the world, capping off an incredible year by winning her first WTA Tour singles title at the Chennai Open -- and following it up with her second WTA doubles title in as many weeks just a few hours later. The first Indonesian player to win a WTA Tour singles title since Angelique Widjaja in 2002 🇮🇩Janice Tjen 👏#ChennaiOpen pic.twitter.com/99c8ij8Skz This was Tjen's second appearance in a WTA Tour-level final. She came close to winning the trophy in Sao Paulo in September but fell short against France's Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah. Sunday's win was even sweeter after that loss, which she described as heartbreaking. “I got to the final in Sao Paulo WTA 250 but luckily today, I came out on the better end.” If you are looking to find out the secret to her stunning breakthrough over the past year, there isn't any -- as Tjen pointed out herself after winning the singles title on Sunday. “I don't think there is any secret,” she said. “I think it's just about putting in the work, trying to improve every aspect of my game, week in and week out. The success has been unexpected even for Tjen, but she isn't paying too much attention to the numbers. "On paper, the rankings do jump out a bit but I don't really think too much about numbers. Perhaps one of the biggest contributing factors to her rise has been that partnership with coach Christopher Bint. “I had been struggling to find a coach that connects with me and has the same values," Tjen said. "Somehow, I got to connect with my coach Christopher Bint and it has been really good till now.” They began a trial partnership in April and May before deciding to work together full time. But things haven't been always easy for Tjen and her family, who come from a humble background in Indonesia. “Tennis is a very expensive sport where you have to travel and then you have to hire a coach," Tjen said. Tjen is grateful for finding the right pathway to give her dream of competing at the highest level a chance. And she has a simple message for aspiring young players. “I think my message would be don't lose hope," she said.
