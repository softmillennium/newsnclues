                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Emma Hayes's short reign as head coach of the USWNT, she has given 25 players their international debut over the past 19 months. After making eight changes to her starting XI in the rematch with Portugal, the USWNT bounced back in a big way to win 3–1. The window closed with a 6–0 thrashing of New Zealand, which was much harder to evaluate. Let's look at who made their case, and what questions remain from these latest friendlies. The 20-year-old attacker has not been a constant since making her senior national team debut in 2023, but a career-best season in the NWSL with the Portland Thorns has pushed her back into Hayes's plans. Moultrie grabbed her opportunity with both hands and scored a quick brace in the 3–1 win over Portugal. Moultrie offers Hayes versatility in the midfield and forward lines. She has the distribution to play deep and help generate passes that move the play forward, setting up chances for others. In a more advanced role, as seen against Portugal, she possesses the ability to finish chances and occupy lethal spaces in the box. It's a crowded field, but Moultrie is certainly making herself known. @olivia_moultrie caught @USWNT coach Emma Hayes' attention right away 🤝 pic.twitter.com/x6WfLQPcJE The 19-year-old center back is making the most of established defenders Tierna Davidson, Alana Cook and Naomi Girma, all being absent due to injury. With poise well beyond her years, Bugg thrived, picking up two starts in both of the USWNT's wins in the October window. She was calm and confident when building from the back. With only four caps to her name and just over a year in the books as a professional, she still has plenty to learn. Known for her blazing pace on the wings, Sears excelled in the October window when it came to drifting more centrally to get the final touch in a passing move and finishing from close range. The 24-year-old was one of just six players on the USWNT roster to appear in all three friendlies, which was an encouraging sign that Hayes knows how she wants the winger to fit into her lineups. With Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson all missing, having a nose for goals will keep you getting called up to camp. That left Mandy McGlynn without any minutes during the October window. It's been one year since McGlynn made her USWNT debut, and, in that time, her club form with Utah Royals has dipped after a very impressive 2024. McGlynn has age on her side, being just 27 years old, which is relatively young for a goalkeeper. The upside of versatile players is that they can be deployed in many roles; the downside is a lack of clarity on their best position. Sentnor hasn't seemed to have quite nailed down a preferred spot in the USWNT. Sentnor hasn't shown a cutting edge in front of the goal or an ability to link with teammates in tight spaces. Sam Coffey subs on and scores to give USA the 3-1 win over Portugal 😤 pic.twitter.com/eKpbpxTnOZ The USWNT defense lacked intensity and organization in that first game. Hayes hopes McKeown's confidence and cohesion with her USWNT teammates will grow, allowing her to transform into a key ball passer from deep at the international level. The question is whether Hayes will allow more time to go to younger defenders, such as Bugg, Kennedy Wesley, or perhaps even Trinity Armstrong.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the pressing issues of form and fitness, and a desire to crack head coach Mauricio Pochettino's 26-player roster, each match at club level is critical for every player as they look towards their ultimate goal of representing the country. A number of high-profile players were in action, but it was actually those who are on the periphery who stood up to be counted as the calendar flipped over until November. Here's Sports Illustrated's top five USMNT performances of the week. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. Pochettino has largely overlooked Joe Scally, but the man with 21 USMNT caps helped Borussia Mönchengladbach keep a clean sheet in a 4–0 win over FC St. Pauli in Bundesliga action. Ricardo Pepi kept up his strong form in the Eredivisie with a goal in a 5–2 win over Fortuna Sittard, his fourth of the season, to help PSV Eindhoven to second in the league table. However, after the game, manager Peter Bosz reiterated that Pepi is his top choice, but has been held out due to the team's success. A ferocious strike from Callum McGregor catches Jack Butland out and restores the @CelticFC lead early on in extra time! It hasn't been a stellar 2025–26 campaign for either Celtic or Rangers, with both changing managers in the blink of an eye. But despite their respective struggles, the Old Firm remains one of the world's most intense derbies, and an American defender was in the thick of it all on Sunday afternoon. Tyler Adams isn't known for scoring goals. Yet, he bagged his first goal since 2021, and the first of his in the Premier League, in AFC Bournemouth's 3–1 loss to Manchester City on Sunday. The goal came in his 65th Premier League appearance, and was just the seventh goal of his professional career, with three of those seven coming with New York Red Bulls II in the USL Championship. While the Cherries weren't able to pull out a positive result at the Etihad Stadium, Adams had a career moment to remember. However, he had to come out in the 80th minute with what looked to be a minor knee injury after receiving treatment on the field. Any players eliminated won't have any club matches until the season starts up again in February, missing out on time to find form ahead of the World Cup. Max Arfsten and the Columbus Crew faced that issue on Sunday night, sitting on the brink of elimination after losing Game 1 of their first-round best-of-three series against Hell is Real rivals FC Cincinnati. Yet, Arfsten and his side stepped up, with the American netting the opening and eventual winning goal in a 4–0 victory, which forced a decisive Game 3 in one of the league's most heated rivalries. In addition to his goal, he also had an assist, eight completed dribbles, and created four chances, earning him Player of the Match honors. Game 3 of the series is set for Nov. 8 at FC Cincinnati's TQL Stadium.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag could be set to return to English football after being considered for the vacant role at a Premier League club. Ten Hag is a free agent after being sacked by Bayer Leverkusen in September, becoming the first manager in Bundesliga history to lose his job after two games. He was fired by United in October 2024, four months after signing a new contract. Pereira was relieved of his duties after Wolves were thrashed 3-0 by Fulham on Saturday, leaving them rooted to the bottom of the Premier League table with no wins from 10 games. He signed a new, three-year contract in September but was sacked six weeks later. Wolves have expressed interest in speaking to Ten Hag, who was discussed internally as a potential candidate. It would be a remarkable turn of events if O'Neil accepted the job as he was only sacked by Wolves less than a year ago, being succeeded by Pereira. Despite further strengthening the squad by signing Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount and Andre Onana, he had a hugely disappointing second campaign. However, they managed to end on a positive note by winning the FA Cup and avenging their previous defeat by Manchester City at Wembley. The shock result led to United unexpectedly keeping faith in Ten Hag and extending his contract until 2026. United's dismal results under successor Ruben Amorim, however, put Ten Hag's reign into some perspective. He said in a statement at the time: "To part ways with a coach after just two league matches is unprecedented. This summer, many key players who were part of past successes left the squad. I feel this was never a relationship based on mutual trust. Throughout my career, every season I have been able to see through to the end as a coach has brought success. Clubs that placed their trust in me have been rewarded with success and silverware." Ten Hag will therefore be keen to get back into management as early as possible and put the episode with Leverkusen behind him. And even if Wolves decide against hiring him, he is bound to be linked with more Premier League jobs in the future.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Recent events, however, have seen Earps veer more towards villain territory than anything else. Change is natural in football and that was especially, and unsurprisingly, the case here, in a situation where Earps had an uber-talented young shot-stopper by the name of Hannah Hampton charging up behind her. It didn't alter the way England fans thought about the player who was so instrumental in such incredible success, not in terms of her legacy and influence. It is instead how Earps has reacted to relinquishing her position as the Lionesses' first-choice goalkeeper, first with the manner of her international retirement back in May and now her stunning comments towards Hampton and England boss Sarina Wiegman, that is changing the public's perception of her for the worse. Indeed, one of the most common takes over the past few days is that Earps has tarnished her Lionesses legacy with her recent comments - and it's hard to disagree. The most headline-grabbing topic from Earps' book, and subsequent interviews, has been Hampton, who usurped her to become England's No.1 ahead of Euro 2025. It's something Earps has referred to again in her book, claiming that "bad behaviour" was "rewarded" when Wiegman decided to bring Hampton back into camps a few months later, despite the England boss explaining that the goalkeeper had "sorted out" the "personal issues" that had kept her away. It's clear that she went away and addressed whatever the issue was enough to satisfy not only Wiegman - an incredibly successful manager who it's hard to believe would stand for any sort of disruptive behaviour - but also Emma Hayes, who signed her to be Chelsea's No.1 not long after. "The only thing I want to say about Hannah is that, since I joined Chelsea, she has grown so much," Sonia Bompastor, Hayes' successor, said on Saturday when asked about Earps' comments. We have a really good relationship together and I want to show her my support in this situation. It's hard to believe that any of them - never mind all three of them - would have Hampton as their first-choice goalkeeper if she was disruptive and detrimental to an environment. It's also worth noting that when asked for specific examples of Hampton's 'bad behaviour' in an interview with the Guardian, Earps said: "I don't want to go into the specifics because it's not my place." When talking about positive comments about Earps made by Hampton, Bompastor was referring to an interview with Glamour earlier in the week, in which Hampton spoke about being on stage alongside Earps to receive the first-ever Women's Yashin Trophy at the Ballon d'Or ceremony. Compare that to comments made by Earps this week and one person certainly comes out looking much better than the other. The positivity in those remarks from Hampton have likely only made fans feel more inclined to go in to bat for her on social media, too. To speak of Hampton like this so soon after being ousted as the Lionesses' No.1 by her has, quite frankly, come across as bitter. It's not helped by Earps' recollection of the moment she decided to retire from international football, either. That decision was called out by many at the time as a selfish act, one which left England with only one capped goalkeeper going into the Euros. However, after being told she would be second in the pecking order, Earps called time on her Lionesses career. Keating was uncapped and just 21 years old going into the Euros, with little opportunity to play before the tournament given how close to its kick-off Earps' decision came. The 32-year-old, meanwhile, had the experience to bolster that goalkeeping union as Wiegman wanted, but Earps clearly didn't want to assume any role other than that of No.1. "I think we had different ideas of what being a team-mate should be," she said when pressed further by the Guardian about issues with Hampton. However, when recalling her decision to retire, she hardly portrays herself as the ideal. How Earps speaks about Wiegman in this passage of her book is also incredibly sad, given it was the ex-Netherlands boss who brought her out of the international wilderness and gave her the platform to become a Lionesses icon. To the surprise of many, after starting for England in a monumental friendly against Germany at Wembley in November 2019, Earps would never be called up again by then-head coach Phil Neville, and it had been almost two years since she had been involved when Wiegman included her in her first England squad, in September 2021. Yet, in her book, as Earps recalls the moment she was told Hampton would be England's No.1 at the Euros, a decision Wiegman says she and her staff had "only just made" when they told her in April of this year, Earps writes: "That sounded like bullsh*t to me." It's no wonder Bompastor, when offering words of support for Hampton this past weekend, also felt compelled to stand up for Wiegman, too: “I just feel like with what I read in terms of comments coming from Mary Earps, it is not acceptable not to show respect to your team-mate or your manager. We are talking about Hannah but I am also raising my voice for Sarina. Did Earps not think this would be the reaction as she released high-profile criticism of a player and a coach who are both incredibly popular across the nation? Her social media posts suggest not, but it's hard to see how she thought these comments, and this timing, was ever a good idea or how it would ever show her in a good light. It's a shame, too, because, as Earps notes, there are a lot of things that she has discussed in her book that are powerful and eye-opening. She discusses her battle to get replica goalkeeper shirts on sale, sexuality, depression, a drinking problem, eating issues and much more. In moments she does, too, give out praise, though not to a degree that will satisfy everyone. Yet, when combined with the shock and intrigue her retirement caused, it is an extract focusing on what is hardly a warm relationship with Hampton, her selfish reaction to the loss of the England No.1 shirt and her criticism of Wiegman's handling of the matter that was always going to overshadow everything else. When GOAL spoke to Earps last month, she talked about her upcoming return to Manchester United, which she will make with Paris Saint-Germain when the two face off in the Champions League at Old Trafford on November 12. "I never really got an opportunity to say goodbye, so I'm looking forward to it," she said, having departed the club after the season had ended and her contract had expired. November 29, before England's friendly with China at Wembley, was a date proposed to the goalkeeper, but she was unable to accept the invitation, with discussions ongoing about a more suitable date. It was anticipated that, for both games, Earps would be greeted with an incredible reception. As well as enjoying an iconic stint as England's No.1, she played a key role at United for five years, culminating in winning the Red Devils' first-ever major trophy on the women's side, in the FA Cup final. When the former England goalkeeper steps foot back on home soil, in a stadium full of supporters with varying intensities of fandom, perhaps it will become more obviously apparent just how much damage she has done. For now, it's clear that she is never going to be revered in the same way again, not like she was just six months ago.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crystal Palace's Chris Richards and Bournemouth's Tyler Adams Getty Images It was a significant weekend for Bournemouth's American midfield destroyer, while Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner questioned whether his Mr Dependable is playing too many minutes for club and country. Tyler Adams is in the form of his life. Adams has been a crucial part of Andoni Iraola's early success, starting every league match this season and registering his first assist of the term in Bournemouth's 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest last week. Still, there was one thing that had eluded him: his first goal in English football. They face Aston Villa on Sunday before Adams joins up with the national team again, having missed the October window as his wife was due to give birth to their second child. Similar to Adams, Chris Richards is enjoying the best season of his Premier League career. He has been an ever-present for Palace in the league this season, contributing to another strong defensive performance in their 2-0 win over Brentford on Saturday. Richards also played the full 90 minutes in Palace's full European debut, helping them beat Dynamo Kyiv 2-0 in the Conference League on October 2. “My only complaint is the U.S. team didn't talk to us because Chris was struggling with his calf for many weeks,” the Austrian said in his pre-match press conference on Friday. “We talked to them and said he should rest as they were just friendlies. On the other side, we've tried to manage his minutes here, resting him against AEK Larnaca, but you can't cheat your body.” Palace are back in action at Selhurst Park on Thursday against Dutch side AZ. Glasner's squad selections indicate he is taking the competition very seriously, so it would not be a surprise to see him pick a full-strength squad again. And with a home tie against rivals Brighton & Hove Albion on Sunday, there's little chance of Richards being rested on the weekend. But with Richards in such impressive form, you can hardly blame USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino. Richards will undoubtedly be a key part of the squad next summer. Despite playing under another new club manager in Luciano Spalletti, Weston McKennie continues to be one of Serie A's most impressive utility men, playing 85 minutes as a quasi-right-winger in Juventus' 2-1 win against Cremonese. He was his typical industrious self without possession, winning two tackles and making four recoveries. But he also showed his attacking qualities, creating two chances with an expected assists tally of 0.72. “Pulisic should return against Parma,” said Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri. “Let's see if Pulisic will be back in Parma and then join his national team… We are in contact with all the national team coaches to tell them our players' conditions.” In Scotland, Auston Trusty did his chances of becoming an established Celtic starter no harm as his side beat Rangers 3-1 in the semi-final of the Scottish League Cup (known as the Premier Sports Cup). Josh Sargent couldn't break his goalscoring duck as Norwich City were beaten 2-0 by Hull City, and Aidan Morris made a limited impact in Middlesbrough's 3-0 defeat to Watford. Damion Downs will be playing under a new head coach, with Southampton calling time on Will Still's disastrous tenure at the helm after a 2-0 away defeat to Preston, which leaves them 21st in the Championship table.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crystal Palace's Chris Richards and Bournemouth's Tyler Adams Getty Images It was a significant weekend for Bournemouth's American midfield destroyer, while Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner questioned whether his Mr Dependable is playing too many minutes for club and country. Tyler Adams is in the form of his life. Adams has been a crucial part of Andoni Iraola's early success, starting every league match this season and registering his first assist of the term in Bournemouth's 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest last week. Still, there was one thing that had eluded him: his first goal in English football. They face Aston Villa on Sunday before Adams joins up with the national team again, having missed the October window as his wife was due to give birth to their second child. Similar to Adams, Chris Richards is enjoying the best season of his Premier League career. He has been an ever-present for Palace in the league this season, contributing to another strong defensive performance in their 2-0 win over Brentford on Saturday. Richards also played the full 90 minutes in Palace's full European debut, helping them beat Dynamo Kyiv 2-0 in the Conference League on October 2. “My only complaint is the U.S. team didn't talk to us because Chris was struggling with his calf for many weeks,” the Austrian said in his pre-match press conference on Friday. “We talked to them and said he should rest as they were just friendlies. On the other side, we've tried to manage his minutes here, resting him against AEK Larnaca, but you can't cheat your body.” Palace are back in action at Selhurst Park on Thursday against Dutch side AZ. Glasner's squad selections indicate he is taking the competition very seriously, so it would not be a surprise to see him pick a full-strength squad again. And with a home tie against rivals Brighton & Hove Albion on Sunday, there's little chance of Richards being rested on the weekend. But with Richards in such impressive form, you can hardly blame USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino. Richards will undoubtedly be a key part of the squad next summer. Despite playing under another new club manager in Luciano Spalletti, Weston McKennie continues to be one of Serie A's most impressive utility men, playing 85 minutes as a quasi-right-winger in Juventus' 2-1 win against Cremonese. He was his typical industrious self without possession, winning two tackles and making four recoveries. But he also showed his attacking qualities, creating two chances with an expected assists tally of 0.72. “Pulisic should return against Parma,” said Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri. “Let's see if Pulisic will be back in Parma and then join his national team… We are in contact with all the national team coaches to tell them our players' conditions.” In Scotland, Auston Trusty did his chances of becoming an established Celtic starter no harm as his side beat Rangers 3-1 in the semi-final of the Scottish League Cup (known as the Premier Sports Cup). Josh Sargent couldn't break his goalscoring duck as Norwich City were beaten 2-0 by Hull City, and Aidan Morris made a limited impact in Middlesbrough's 3-0 defeat to Watford. Damion Downs will be playing under a new head coach, with Southampton calling time on Will Still's disastrous tenure at the helm after a 2-0 away defeat to Preston, which leaves them 21st in the Championship table. In more positive news, Patrick Agyemang proved an excellent foil for hat-trick hero Carlton Morris as Derby County dispatched Sheffield United, and USMNT-eligible Charlie Kelman scored his first goal of the season in Charlton Athletic's 1-1 draw with Swansea City. McKennie will be hoping his Juventus side can earn their first win of this season's Champions League against Portugal's Sporting CP tomorrow, available on ESPN3 and Paramount+.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2026 FIFA World Cup, kicking off June 11 across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, will feature 48 teams in 104 matches over 39 days, coinciding with America's 250th anniversary. While the event was expected to spark surging hotel demand in host cities, its impact has so far fallen short of expectations, more so in the United States to date, especially as prices for U.S. World Cup tickets are significantly more expensive than in Canada and Mexico. Tighter borders, trade tensions, and stricter visa requirements are driving a decline in U.S. tourism, affecting sectors ranging from hospitality to construction. With major ticket sales still ahead for FIFA 2026, the U.S. trails its World Cup co-hosts in year-over-year growth in hotel rates. Experts point to several factors behind the slowdown, but with nine months remaining, the U.S. hotel industry could see a sharp rebound in bookings after the final draw and full match schedule are released on December 5. Hospitality data firm Lighthouse reports that length-of-stay rules have limited hotel inventory for FIFA 2026, with occupancy in most host cities still in single digits, nine months before the event. Despite differing price surges across regions, average room rates remain well above typical 2026 levels and higher than the same period in 2025, signaling what Lighthouse calls a “clear anticipation of future demand.” "When viewed in context, current booking levels are higher than normal for this time of year, but still far below what a World Cup host market would typically expect," the report states. There is also a projected dip in international travel spending in the U.S. for 2025, with more restrictive visa conditions and tighter border procedures. For hotels in U.S. host cities, the FIFA World Cup has driven aggressive pricing strategies and heightened expectations, with year-over-year rate growth outpacing the national average. The report indicates that, while current booking levels exceed typical figures for this time of year, they remain significantly below what's expected for a World Cup host market. With roughly six million tickets, about 85%, still available, and several factors weighing on early demand, the main hotel booking surge, particularly in the U.S., is yet to come. The report also notes that many hotels appear unavailable during the tournament, either due to length-of-stay restrictions or withheld inventory. With both hotels and fans "on pause" until the final ticket draw on December 5, a surge in bookings is expected once fans learn where their teams will play. “Many hotels are holding back inventory and setting minimum-stay requirements in anticipation of higher-value bookings later,” the report also said. On the other hand, FIFA's ticket prices have been causing a stir since they were announced, with some fans believing the U.S. is pricing itself out of travelers' radars. FIFA has also announced that its resale site is now open, and tickets for the World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey, are available on the FIFA website at prices ranging from $9,538 to $57,500 per seat. Tickets for the U.S. are more expensive when averaged out, which may also be driving away some travelers to America's neighboring co-host nations instead. Below are each host country's average group stage ticket prices for further comparison. All in all, fans heading to the U.S. for the FIFA World Cup in 2026 will have to put their hands deeper into their pockets. Whether or not these prices will actually steer travelers away (and potentially have a knock-on effect on the U.S. hotel industry) is yet to be seen. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Only trump would try to tie in these two events - for his own purpose of course. No, baseball is FAR more boring and who needs 6-1/2 hour games? Brent Baseball and chezz are boring as hell, not action and too much stoppage, no wonder is the sport where you see the most people sleeping in the stadium, even their own fans who go there because they like that sport fall of sleep! Your sports are akin to rugby for girls, netball and what we call rounders. I'd be happy if you never got a chance to host a World Cup again, you don't deserve it. There's a good chance they'll be denied entry or arrested by ICE and deported.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Steve Clarke's side are away to Greece on November 15 and then face Denmark at Hampden Park three days later; wins over Greece and Belarus last month helped secure a play-off spot; Scotland will qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1998 if they draw in Greece and beat Denmark Scotland head coach Steve Clarke has recalled four players to his squad for the decisive World Cup qualifiers against Greece and Denmark. Falkirk goalkeeper Scott Bain - who made the last of his three appearances for the national side in March 2019 against San Marino - is included in place of No 1 Angus Gunn. Nottingham Forest's Gunn - who had started all of Scotland's four previous qualifiers - has suffered a knee ligament injury, with Craig Gordon, 42, and Rangers' Liam Kelly the other goalkeeping options for Clarke. Meanwhile, Bristol City's Ross McCrorie will hope to make his first Scotland appearance in over a year after also being added to a larger 25-player group. Elsewhere, Clarke is hopeful Aaron Hickey will feature for Brentford in the coming week after recovering from an injury that has kept him sidelined since early October. Meanwhile, in an unchanged midfield, Billy Gilmour is expected to be fit despite coming off injured during Napoli's draw with Como at the weekend. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player With a World Cup play-off spot already secured, Clarke's side head to Greece on November 15 before welcoming Group C leaders Denmark to Hampden Park three days later in a potential winner-takes-all clash. Denmark have a better goal difference and face Belarus next, so Scotland will likely need to pick up at least a draw in Greece before beating Denmark at the national stadium if they're to secure automatic qualification to the finals for the first time since 1998. "They [Greece] can't be involved in the play-offs or the shake-up for first place, but that doesn't mean to say it's not going to be a difficult game in Greece, because I'm sure they'll be fired up to prove that they're better than Scotland. Goalkeepers: Scott Bain (Falkirk), Craig Gordon (Hearts), Liam Kelly (Rangers). Defenders: Josh Doig (Sassuolo), Grant Hanley (Hibernian), Jack Hendry (Al Etiffaq), Aaron Hickey (Brentford), Ross McCrorie (Bristol City), Scott McKenna (Dinamo Zagreb), Anthony Ralston (Celtic), Andy Robertson (Liverpool), John Souttar (Rangers), Kieran Tierney (Celtic). Midfielders: Ryan Christie (Bournemouth), Lewis Ferguson (Bologna), Ben Gannon Doak (Bournemouth), Billy Gilmour (Napoli), John McGinn (Aston Villa), Kenny McLean (Norwich), Scott McTominay (Napoli), Lennon Miller (Udinese). Forwards: Che Adams (Torino), Lyndon Dykes (Birmingham), George Hirst (Ipswich), Lawrence Shankland (Hearts). Scotland picked up four points from their opening two qualifiers, drawing away to top-seeds Denmark, before beating Belarus 2-0 to end September joint-top of the table. Next up was a Hampden Park double header in which all six points were claimed. Clarke's side did it the hard way, as they came from behind to beat Greece 3-1, before a 2-1 win over Belarus helped secure a play-off spot.

The 2026 FIFA men's World Cup takes place from June 11 to July 19, 2026. It is the first time a World Cup has been hosted by three nations. An expanded World Cup will feature 48 teams - 16 more than in Qatar 2022 - and take place across three host nations for the first time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>L-R: One of Liam Kelly, Scott Bain and Craig Gordon will start in goal for Scotland Manager Steve Clarke has played down Scotland's goalkeeping crisis and is intent on setting up a "cup final" against Denmark in the second of this month's pivotal World Cup qualifiers. Angus Gunn, who has started all four qualifiers, is missing through injury so Falkirk's Scott Bain - the 33-year-old who won the last of his three caps in San Marino in 2019 - returns for the games against against Greece and Denmark. Clarke's choice in goal will be between Bain, Liam Kelly - who has made one League Cup appearance for Rangers this term - and Craig Gordon, who will be 43 next month and has not played at all this season. They are likely to need at least a point in Greece on 15 November to set up a winner-takes-all showdown at Hampden against Denmark three days later, given the group leaders have a superior goal difference and face bottom side Belarus next. "It's always a blow when somebody misses out with injury and Angus did well in the four games up until now. As long you've got boys who train well, goalkeepers can be out of the team for a long time and when they're asked to go in, they'll be ready." Goalkeepers: Scott Bain (Falkirk), Craig Gordon (Heart of Midlothian), Liam Kelly (Rangers) Defenders: Josh Doig (Sassuolo), Grant Hanley (Hibernian), Jack Hendry (Al-Etiffaq), Aaron Hickey (Brentford), Ross McCrorie (Bristol City), Scott McKenna (Dinamo Zagreb), Anthony Ralston (Celtic), Andy Robertson (Liverpool), John Souttar (Rangers), Kieran Tierney (Celtic) Midfielders: Ryan Christie (Bournemouth), Lewis Ferguson (Bologna), Ben Gannon-Doak (Bournemouth), Billy Gilmour (Napoli), John McGinn (Aston Villa), Kenny McLean (Norwich City), Scott McTominay (Napoli), Lennon Miller (Udinese) Forwards: Che Adams (Torino), Lyndon Dykes (Birmingham City), George Hirst (Ipswich Town), Lawrence Shankland (Heart of Midlothian) Shankland has formed a fine partnership up front for Hearts with new signing Claudio Braga this season, with his goal in Saturday's 4-0 demolition of Dundee taking him top of the domestic scoring charts. Bristol City's McCrorie, who made his sole Scotland appearance against Gibraltar last year, returns to provide additional cover at right-back, with Aaron Hickey only just back from the injury he sustained during the last international window. Derby County's Max Johnston has been ruled out for up to eight weeks with a hamstring injury while Nathan Patterson of Everton needs a hernia operation. Billy Gilmour came off after 38 minutes of Napoli's 0-0 draw with Como at the weekend but takes his place in the squad alongside club-mate Scott McTominay. Lawrence Shankland tops the Scottish Premiership goalscoring chart this season with seven for leaders Hearts If you need someone in the squad for goals, Lawrence is your man.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans have been flocking to soccer matches in Jalisco, Mexico, as authorities fine-tune security for the 2026 FIFA World Cup Mexico!” while walking past dozens of police officers, bomb-sniffing dogs, metal detectors and drone jammers — as authorities fine-tuned security ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. It's a jarring contrast especially present in Jalisco, where 48,000-seat soccer stadiums and fan zones — like the site of the Oct. 14 friendly match between Mexico and Ecuador — coexist with one of the world's most powerful criminal organizations. The state — which will host four World Cup matches in June 2026 — is home to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, arguably Mexico's most powerful with an estimated 19,000 members and operations spanning 21 of Mexico's 32 states. With a population of 8 million, Jalisco leads in disappearances and is among Mexico's top four states for crime rate. “If you don't get yourself into trouble, nothing will happen,” said Javier Rodríguez, an 18-year-old college student on his way to the stadium. South of Guadalajara, off the highway that leads to the snowbird destination of Lake Chapala, Indira Navarro and a group of volunteers dug up the concrete slab behind an abandoned house following a tip that human remains were buried there. They're members of the Jalisco Search Warriors, one of many volunteer groups across Mexico who spend their free time searching for the missing, hoping to find their own relatives or bring closure to another family. However, earlier this year the team searched a ranch near Guadalajara — a site authorities raided the prior year — unearthing hundreds of garments and burned bone fragments that left authorities scrambling to explain why the initial investigation of the purported cartel recruitment and training site had been so shoddy. The Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which the Trump administration designated a foreign terrorist organization earlier this year, has established itself as Mexico's most powerful criminal organization. Roberto Alarcón, Jalisco's state security strategy coordinator, downplayed the local cartel's presence while simultaneously suggesting that their dominance actually makes security efforts easier. “Not having a great number of criminal groups like other states allows … security authorities to attack these groups in a better, more controlled way," said Alarcón, adding that all major crimes in the state are, in fact, trending downward. Security analyst David Saucedo expects to see a tacit agreement between the cartel and the government, in which security forces would hold off on operations to capture cartel leaders, provided the cartel avoids any high-profile actions. “I think both sides will agree to a truce that, obviously, might not last very long," Saucedo said. Organized crime, he said, will take advantage of the World Cup to “increase its criminal activity” in casinos, street-level drug sales, sexual tourism and reselling tickets, he said. “I think they're going to enjoy the World Cup themselves.” A day before the Oct. 14 friendly match, Jalisco Gov. Security concerns and preparedness were notably absent from the discussion. “These events help slightly repair social pain and bring the opportunity for better security measures simply because so many people are attending,” she said. In addition to drone jammers and armored vehicles, Jalisco is installing 3,000 additional surveillance cameras, pushing the state's total past 10,000, a legacy of the World Cup that could continue to benefit residents after the tournament ends. But for those like Navarro, who have dedicated their lives to searching for loved ones with little help from authorities, the World Cup hype feels like whitewashing Jalisco's violence.
