                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from Tulane University found that, over the past decade, more states have moved to make it easier for people with opioid use disorder to get potentially life-saving medication. The study published in Health Affairs found that, as of 2023, 22 states have passed laws prohibiting private insurance plans from requiring prior authorization, a process that requires doctors to get insurer approval before prescribing certain medications for opioid use disorder. This signals a positive trend that states are taking legislative efforts to address the opioid crisis. Prior authorization is a major barrier to care and removing it helps patients start treatment faster." Allison Ju-Chen Hu, lead author, assistant professor of health policy and management at the Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University The study analyzed state laws from 2015 to 2023 and focused on private insurance since those with private coverage are more likely to encounter prior authorization than those enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid. More than one-third of people with opioid use disorder are covered by private insurance. Medications for opioid use disorder include methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone. If prior authorization is denied by an insurer, a doctor can still provide the medication, but the patient must pay out of pocket or go without treatment. "Having coverage doesn't necessarily guarantee access to needed medications," Hu said. The study also found that eight states extended the scope of their prior authorization prohibitions to naloxone, a medication that reverses opioid overdoses. Approximately 80,000 Americans died from drug overdoses involving opioids in 2023. "With proper enforcement, patients in these states should face fewer delays and have an easier time getting the medications they need," Hu said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many young people who suffered sudden cardiac death had recently sought medical care. More frequent use of electrocardiograms (ECG) could help prevent such cases, according to researchers at the University of Gothenburg. It is, however, very rare: about 15 cases occur each year in Sweden. In this Swedish nationwide study, researchers examined all cases of sudden arrhythmic death among individuals aged 1 to 35 who died in Sweden between 2000 and 2010. Using Sweden's national health and population registers along with medical records, the researchers analyzed symptoms, ECG results, and healthcare visits prior to death. Each case was compared with ten randomly selected individuals from the Swedish population, matched by age, sex, and county of residence. Key findings: • Most of the victims were young men in their early twenties. • Half had shown early warning signs such as fainting or palpitations. • One in three had sought medical care within six months of death. Among these, visits for fainting were twenty times more common and visits for seizures ten times more common than among controls. • Nearly one in five had a previously abnormal ECG. "It's striking that so many had seen a doctor shortly before the event. It shows that we have an opportunity to identify those at risk before something happens," says Matilda Frisk Torell. The results indicate that fainting, seizures, and abnormal ECG findings in young people should be taken more seriously.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international panel of leading women's mental health experts – including UVA Health's Jennifer Payne, MD – is calling to reclassify postpartum psychosis as its own category of mental illness to improve the care new mothers receive. Postpartum psychosis is a severe psychiatric illness that is estimated to strike up to 2.6 out of every 1,000 women after they give birth. Symptoms can include mania, depression with psychotic features, impaired thinking, agitation and irritability. Left untreated, the condition can cause women to commit suicide or kill their babies. It is considered a psychiatric emergency and often requires hospitalization. The condition is considered one of the most easily identified mental illnesses among women because of its rapid onset and distinctive symptoms, yet it is not recognized in two key resources used for medical treatment and billing: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, often called DSM-5, or the International Classification of Disease. "Postpartum psychosis is a very rare and serious psychiatric illness which requires a specific treatment approach," said Payne, an expert in reproductive psychiatry at the University of Virginia School of Medicine and the senior author of a new "consensus statement" urging the change. "Recognition of postpartum psychosis as a distinct clinical entity will promote evidence-based, safe and effective treatment." They note that women typically respond extremely well to existing treatments, such as lithium. These treatments are often used for bipolar disorder, formerly known as manic depression. (Women who develop postpartum psychosis have a 50-50 chance of developing bipolar disorder, while pregnant women who are already diagnosed with bipolar disorder are at extremely high risk for postpartum psychosis.) This, the authors say, incorrectly describes how postpartum psychosis can set in weeks or months after delivery. To facilitate diagnosis, they have proposed specific criteria, such as depression, delusions and hallucinations, to include in the treatment and coding resources. We hope that recognition of postpartum psychosis as a distinct clinical entity will improve identification and outcomes and lead to further research to identify the underlying pathophysiology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For someone who has heart surgery or experiences a major cardiovascular event, cardiac rehabilitation can significantly improve their short and long term recovery. People who participate in this comprehensive exercise, lifestyle and education program are less likely to be readmitted to the hospital and have a lower risk of future heart attack. Despite a slew of benefits linked to cardiac rehabilitation, attendance remains poor - with even fewer women utilizing the program. Even when women do participate, the research tells us that they are still less likely to complete cardiac rehabilitation as compared to men. There are several barriers that women face to accessing cardiac rehabilitation, and existing programs may fail to adequately address their specific needs." Jessica Golbus, M.D., cardiologist, University of Michigan Health Frankel Cardiovascular Center The statement, published in Circulation, addressed benefits, barriers to access and possible solutions for increasing participation among women. Despite women participating in cardiac rehabilitation less than men, studies have shown that women who utilize it experience at least as much benefit as men. Golbus: There are many barriers that women face to accessing cardiac rehabilitation, and they vary widely. First, women have lower referral rates than men for cardiac rehabilitation. We know that patients are much more likely to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation once they have discussed it with their clinician, and clinicians are unfortunately less likely to have that essential conversation with women. This is even more pronounced among women from underrepresented racial groups. Issues with insurance coverage, transportation and social isolation can also limit their participation. Women are more often caregivers, and those responsibilities may serve as a barrier to enrollment. For example, both men and women with cardiovascular disease are likely to experience depression and psychosocial distress after a cardiovascular event, but this is particularly pronounced among women. Lastly, women are also more likely to be referred to cardiac rehabilitation after less common cardiovascular diagnoses such as a coronary artery dissection. Despite women having some unique needs, the research supports that all patients that qualify for cardiac rehabilitation have the potential for benefit. The easiest barrier to address is by increasing referrals for women. Studies have shown that introducing an automatic referral process can greatly increase referrals. Other strategies like a physician's recommendation or facilitated enrollment though a case manager have also been shown to be effective strategies for increasing awareness about cardiac rehabilitation and improving enrollment. Cardiac rehabilitation teams might consider tailoring certain programming to women. This could include having a broader range of exercise choices, focused education or offering more extensive psychosocial support. Participating in those groups is linked to increased quality of life and lower depression and anxiety scores, which all affect cardiac rehab attendance. Finally, there is reason to explore virtual cardiac rehab that incorporates digital health technologies. This could eliminate the need for transportation to sessions and potentially improve access for patients who are unable to attend center-based cardiac rehabilitation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It breaks down cells that are damaged or have undergone dangerous changes. However, cancer cells often manage to override this mechanism. A research team at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has now succeeded in identifying a new molecular switch in this process and elucidating how it works. The big advantage is that we are dealing with a highly efficient, evolutionarily developed regulatory mechanism. So, we don't have to invent something completely new, but can use the appropriate structural methods to learn from nature's optimized processes." To prevent healthy cells from accidentally destroying themselves, the apoptosis system is very balanced. The researchers were able to show that the protein Bcl-xL, an apoptosis inhibitor that prevents overreactions, can be overridden by another protein called VDAC1 when necessary. VDAC1 then unfolds part of its structure, connects it to Bcl-xL, and thus deactivates the inhibitor. Dr. Umut Günsel and Dr. Melina Daniilidis, co-first authors of the study in Prof. Hagn's team at the Bavarian NMR Center, which is jointly supported by TUM and Helmholtz Munich, emphasize: "In our study, we used high-resolution structural methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray crystallography, and cryo-electron microscopy to investigate how the VDAC1 protein changes under stress conditions. We also combined this data with biochemical functional experiments to show that VDAC1 actually binds to the brake protein Bcl-xL, thereby promoting apoptosis." This newly understood regulatory mechanism opens up possibilities for the search for active substances that could influence the behavior of VDAC1. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, the opposite would be true. There, one could try to block the unwanted death of nerve cells. Deactivation of VDAC1 could also be helpful in certain heart diseases such as ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, there is still a long way to go before these new findings can be applied clinically. The search for appropriate active substances can now begin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Living farther than 30 km from a family physician can negatively affect access to health care, found a new Ontario study published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250265. Even after moving, many patients reported continuing with their family physicians, despite travelling longer distances to reach them. "Distance to health care services is an important determinant of health and can be classified as a factor of health care utilization, with increased distance a potential barrier to receiving care," writes Dr. Archna Gupta, a scientist at Upstream Lab and a family physician at St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, with coauthors. To understand the impact of distance between family physicians and their patients on health care usage and quality of care, researchers undertook a large study based on data as of Mar. The study of almost 10 million patients in Ontario, Canada's largest province, found that 13% of patients lived more than 30 km from their family physician. These patients were more likely to visit the emergency department for nonurgent reasons and had fewer visits with a family physician in the previous two years. Our research shows that people use the emergency room not just because they don't have a family doctor or can't get an appointment. It's also because their family doctor might be too far away to reach easily. The distance makes it harder for many Ontarians to get the care they need when they need it most." Patients who lived more than 150 km from their family physician had the highest odds of an emergency department visit for nonurgent reasons and were less likely to visit their physician. As well, the farther patients lived from their primary care physician, the less likely they were to undergo preventive screening for colorectal, breast, or cervical cancer. The authors hope this study will aid policy-makers with health care planning. Our findings suggest that reforms should prioritize offering primary care a minimum of 30 km from a patient's home," conclude the authors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A hidden atrial dysfunction may raise stroke risk in people with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM); however, a non-invasive assessment tool may help identify those at increased risk, according to a preliminary study to be presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting, Nov. 7-10, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science. Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a potentially fatal disease that has historically been considered rare. This protein buildup can stiffen the heart walls, making it difficult for the left ventricle to relax and fill with a regular heart rhythm. Even with a regular heart rhythm, some people with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy are still at risk of stroke if their atrium doesn't squeeze well. This hidden dysfunction could help guide earlier conversations and treatment about preventive strategies including anticoagulation medications." Aldostefano Porcari, M.D., Ph.D., study author, consultant cardiologist at Cardiovascular Department, University of Trieste, Italy, and researcher at the National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London Researchers at the U.K. National Amyloidosis Centre analyzed health records between 2003 and 2023 and reviewed those of more than 2,300 adults with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. About 1 in 8 of the patients with regular heart rhythm had atrial electromechanical dissociation (AEMD), a condition where the upper heart chamber, the atrium, looks normal on an electrocardiogram, yet does not contract and pump blood effectively. With this data, researchers developed a risk-prediction tool that uses two measures widely available on echocardiograms to measure the mechanical function of the atrial chamber. They found that stroke risk rose steadily as the atrium's ability to squeeze weakened. The risk pattern was consistent across people with different genetic subtypes of ATTR amyloidosis and across different disease stages, suggesting atrial dysfunction represents a common driver of stroke risk in this condition. "These findings shift attention from rhythm function to how well the atrium actually squeezes," Porcari said. The study is observational, so it cannot prove cause and effect. The next step is to conduct a prospective, multicenter study to investigate how this tool works and if preventive anticoagulation can lower the risk of stroke in people with atrial electromechanical dissociation. Researchers said the goal is to generate practice-ready evidence that can guide individualized decisions and, ultimately, help prevent disabling or fatal cerebrovascular events. Fernando D. Testai, M.D., Ph.D., FAHA, vice-chair of the American Heart Association's Brain Health Committee, who was not involved in the study noted that "patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy who remain in sinus rhythm still exhibit a significantly elevated stroke risk compared to the general population, so there is a need for novel strategies to identify high-risk individuals who may benefit from anticoagulation, even in the absence of atrial fibrillation. The diagnosis of atrial electromechanical dissociation relied on speckle-tracking strain echocardiography, a specialized imaging technique which is not widely accessible and the findings require validation in larger, independent groups." Other limitations include that the classification of strokes was sometimes missing, and more research is needed to determine potential treatment options for people with AEMD.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A combined analysis of blood tests to measure three biomarkers linked to higher risk of cardiovascular disease-lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), remnant cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)-may help identify high-risk individuals earlier and guide more personalized prevention strategies, according to a preliminary study to be presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting, Nov. 7-10, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science. The three blood tests examine different pathways that can lead to cardiovascular disease. Remnant cholesterol refers to harmful fat particles in the blood that standard cholesterol tests can miss but can also clog arteries. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) measures inflammation in the body. Elevated levels of hsCRP may signal that the body is under stress and may indicate risk of damage to the arteries. Each of the blood tests on its own indicate only a modest increase in heart attack risk, however, when we found elevated levels for all three, the risk of heart attack was nearly three times higher." "These biomarkers work together like pieces of a puzzle. One piece cannot show the full picture, yet when combined, we can see a much clearer and more complete depiction of heart attack risks," he added. Researchers reviewed health data from the UK Biobank, one of the world's largest health databases, for more than 300,000 participants who were free of heart disease when they were first enrolled. Evaluating the combined results of all three blood tests may help health care professionals act more quickly and provide tailored care for people with the highest risk. In addition, guidance that encourages healthy lifestyle changes or initiating treatment, such as medication to lower cholesterol and/or blood pressure, are keys to reducing risk and preventing heart attacks," Kazibwe said. Although these blood tests are not yet part of routine screening guidelines, Kazibwe notes this combination approach may be more accessible than it initially appears. Lp(a) and hsCRP tests are available at most labs upon request, and health care professionals can calculate remnant cholesterol from standard cholesterol panels already performed during many routine checkups. "Even if traditional risk factors like cholesterol and blood pressure are under control, these simple blood tests can identify hidden inflammation, genetic risk and cholesterol abnormalities. The results could help health care professionals detect heart disease risk earlier and guide steps to keep your heart healthy before symptoms appear or a cardiac event occurs," Kazibwe said. Developed by the American Heart Association in 2023, the PREVENTTM risk calculator uses cardiovascular, kidney and metabolic health factors to more precisely estimate a person's cardiovascular disease risk, which can help guide treatment decisions personalized for each individual. Kazibwe emphasized that people with a family history of heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or other cardiovascular risk factors may particularly benefit from discussing these additional biomarker tests with their health care team. "Advances in the accuracy and precision of risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (caused by plaque buildup in arterial walls) mean that clinicians can now more precisely identify individuals who are likely to benefit from preventive therapies," said Pamela Morris, M.D., FAHA, an American Heart Association volunteer expert and a professor of cardiology, Paul V. Palmer Endowed Chair in cardiovascular disease prevention and director of the Seinsheimer Cardiovascular Health Program at the Medical University of South Carolina. This study supports recommendations that consideration of risk enhancers including Lp(a), hsCRP and remnant cholesterol can play an important role in personalizing risk estimates. Kazibwe acknowledges some health care professionals may initially be cautious about adding more tests due to cost and insurance coverage considerations, however, growing research and new treatments are making these tests increasingly relevant in preventive cardiology care. "The three biomarker tests represent part of a larger toolkit for assessing heart attack risks that also include genetic risk scores and coronary artery calcium scans. The future challenge will be learning how to combine all this information to help health care professionals make personalized decisions for each patient," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Long-term use of melatonin supplements, often used to promote sleep and address insomnia, was associated with a higher risk of heart failure diagnosis, heart failure hospitalization and death from any cause in chronic insomnia, according to a preliminary study to be presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting, Nov. 7-10, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science. Chemically identical synthetic versions of the hormone are often used to treat insomnia (difficulty falling and/or staying asleep) and jet lag. In this study, researchers classified people who had used melatonin long-term (with long-term use defined as a year or more documented in their electronic health records) as part of the "melatonin group." If our study is confirmed, this could affect how doctors counsel patients about sleep aids." Ekenedilichukwu Nnadi, M.D., lead author of the study and chief resident in internal medicine at SUNY Downstate/Kings County Primary Care in Brooklyn, New York Melatonin supplements are promoted and marketed as a safe sleep aid; however, data demonstrating their long-term cardiovascular safety are lacking, which prompted the researchers to examine whether melatonin use alters the risk of heart failure, specifically in chronic insomnia patients. According to the American Heart Association's 2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics, heart failure occurs when the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs for them to function properly and is a common condition that affects 6.7 million adults in the U.S. Using a large international database (the TriNetX Global Research Network), the researchers reviewed 5 years of electronic health records for adults with chronic insomnia who had melatonin recorded in their health records and used it for more than a year. They were matched with peers in the database who also had insomnia but never had melatonin recorded in their health records. People were excluded from the analysis if they had previously been diagnosed with heart failure or had been prescribed other sleep medications. "Melatonin supplements are widely thought of as a safe and 'natural' option to support better sleep, so it was striking to see such consistent and significant increases in serious health outcomes, even after balancing for many other risk factors," Nnadi said. "I'm surprised that physicians would prescribe melatonin for insomnia and have patients use it for more than 365 days, since melatonin, at least in the U.S., is not indicated for the treatment of insomnia. In the U.S., melatonin can be taken as an over-the-counter supplement and people should be aware that it should not be taken chronically without a proper indication," said Marie-Pierre St-Onge, Ph.D., C.C.S.H., FAHA, chair of the writing group for the American Heart Association's 2025 scientific statement, Multidimensional Sleep Health: Definitions and Implications for Cardiometabolic Health. Hospitalization figures were also higher than those for initial diagnosis of heart failure because a range of related diagnostic codes may be entered for the hospitalization, and they may not always include the code for a new diagnosis of heart failure. "Worse insomnia, depression/anxiety or the use of other sleep-enhancing medicines might be linked to both melatonin use and heart risk," Nnadi said. "Also, while the association we found raises safety concerns about the widely used supplement, our study cannot prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship. This means more research is needed to test melatonin's safety for the heart."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Once reserved for emperors, black rice is making a comeback as a natural way to boost antioxidants, support metabolism, and power a new generation of healthy, plant-based foods. Review: Black rice as the emerging functional food: bioactive compounds, therapeutic potential and industrial applications. About half of the global population relies on rice as a basic food source. In Asia, nearly two billion people derive 60 to 70% of their daily caloric intake from rice. The need for better food options to support the growing population has been a key factor driving demand for plant-based foods. Nutritional analyses have shown that, in addition to macronutrients, black rice contains essential amino acids (e.g., tryptophan and lysine), minerals, and vitamins. Black rice contains substantial amounts of zinc, selenium, and iron, which are essential for the functioning of antioxidant enzymes. It also contains B-complex vitamins, vitamin E, and β-carotene. Germination also increases γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, further enhancing the nutritional value of black rice. Resistant starch in black rice amplifies these effects by enhancing insulin sensitivity and decelerating carbohydrate digestion. Studies have reported improvements in glucose homeostasis in rats with diabetes following the administration of black rice extracts (BRE). Studies on rats have reported that cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), an anthocyanin found in black rice, enhances superoxide dismutase activity, inhibits lipid peroxidation, and induces a hypoglycemic effect. However, the review notes that anthocyanin bioavailability in humans is generally low, which may limit the translation of these effects to clinical outcomes. Anthocyanin fractions from black rice bran were found to protect neuronal cells from endoplasmic and oxidative stress induced by amyloid-beta. One study reported that anthocyanins mitigated cytokine storms caused by the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in lung cell models. The anti-metastatic properties of C3G and peonidin-3-glucoside, the two primary anthocyanins in black rice, have also been well documented. Black rice processing influences the degradation or preservation of its bioactive compounds. A comprehensive metabolomics study examined the changes in metabolites in black rice following germination, milling, and exposure to high pressure and temperature. It noted that germination increased γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), phenolic compounds, and γ-oryzanol, while milling reduced anthocyanins and phenolic compounds. Conversely, pressure heat treatment was linked to microbiological safety. Other studies have found that approximately 4% polishing during milling reduces anthocyanin content by 50-90%. Furthermore, post-harvest sprouting, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and fermentation may partially increase the levels of bioactive compounds. Enzymatic acylation was found to enhance antioxidant capacity and stabilize anthocyanin levels in black rice. Incorporating anthocyanin-enriched BRE into the coatings of extruded snacks can prolong their shelf life. Using black rice flour instead of wheat flour for bread baking has been reported to decrease glycemic index and enhance antioxidant capacity. Similarly, using black rice flour in pasta increases the dietary fiber content and reduces the glycemic index, while incorporating it into noodles diminishes oil absorption during frying. Taken together, black rice is a culturally significant, nutrient-dense functional food that contains substantial levels of minerals, anthocyanins, dietary fiber, phenolic compounds, and resistant starch. However, the human clinical evidence remains limited and mixed, with some short-duration trials showing benefits to body composition and others reporting no changes in lipid levels, indicating the need for adequately powered, longer-term, standardized, randomized controlled trials before drawing firm conclusions. The authors also highlight practical challenges, including low crop yield, high production costs, and water-intensive cultivation, which must be addressed to ensure sustainable scaling of black rice as a functional food crop. Black rice is also an excellent ingredient in the food industry, including beverages, functional and gluten-free snacks, baked foods, and colorants. Tarun is a writer based in Hyderabad, India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new Italian study reveals that a daily blend of citrus and grape extracts with chromium can normalize blood sugar and improve cholesterol faster than diet alone, offering new hope for millions living with prediabetes. Study: Impact of a food supplement containing Citrus limon L. Osbeck and Vitis vinifera L. extracts, hesperidin and chromium in combination with an isocaloric diet on glucose and lipid metabolism in subjects with impaired fasting blood glucose: a single-center, controlled, randomized, parallel-arm, double-blind clinical trial. Study findings revealed that supplementation reduced fasting blood glucose from 114 to 94 mg/dL within 6 months and achieved normal fasting levels by 3 months, while also improving low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C, "bad") cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C, "good") cholesterol, and triglycerides. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG), commonly known as prediabetes, is a rapidly growing global health issue. It is characterized by blood sugar levels higher than normal but not yet diagnostic of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and is strongly linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Although prediabetes is often reversible through a healthy diet and exercise, adherence is low, and lifestyle measures alone are frequently insufficient. This has led researchers to explore nutritional supplements that can complement traditional lifestyle interventions and deliver measurable metabolic benefits. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial aimed to determine whether a specific blend of ingredients, chromium, hesperidin, and extracts from lemon and red grapes, could improve glucose metabolism and lipid balance in individuals with IFG. The study enrolled 62 Italian adults (ages 18–75) diagnosed with IFG (fasting blood glucose levels of 100–125 mg/dL). Participants were randomly assigned to either the supplement or placebo group. The treatment group received two tablets daily (after lunch and dinner) for six months, while both groups followed an isocaloric DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. The supplement provided 250 µg of chromium and 560 mg of flavonoids derived from Citrus limon (lemon), Vitis vinifera (red grape), and Citrus sinensis (orange). Participants received dietary counseling to maintain an isocaloric regimen. Blood samples were collected at baseline, three months, and six months to measure key biomarkers, including glucose, insulin, HbA1c, and lipid fractions. The primary endpoint was the effect of supplementation on fasting blood glucose (FBG), while secondary endpoints included HbA1c, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and lipid markers (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides). Statistical analyses incorporated demographic and medical history corrections to ensure robust comparisons between groups. HbA1c decreased significantly only in the supplement group, while insulin and HOMA-IR showed no treatment effect. Conversely, triglyceride levels increased in the placebo group (p = 0.0012). Within six months, the formulation normalized blood glucose and improved lipid balance, suggesting strong cardiovascular benefits. However, limitations include the single-center design, restriction to participants with a BMI <30, and lack of post-trial follow-up, which may affect generalizability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new California study reveals that “safe” levels of PFAS in tap water may still lead to elevated toxic chemicals in the bloodstream, raising new concerns about everyday exposure and regulatory limits. Their findings suggest that even in areas without industrial PFAS manufacturing, people can be significantly exposed to these “forever chemicals” through contaminated drinking water, requiring ongoing monitoring. PFAS are man-made chemicals used for resistance to heat, stains, and water. They persist in the environment and human body, accumulating in water and living organisms due to their long half-lives. Humans are mainly exposed through contaminated water and food. There is also exposure via skin contact, dust, or consumer products. Certain PFAS have been linked to health problems such as cancer, hormone disruption, reduced birth weight, and immune system effects. High PFAS contamination is often found near chemical manufacturing plants or sites using firefighting foams, but low-level contamination is now widespread. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that thousands of water systems serving millions of Americans exceed newly established limits for at least one PFAS. Although California lacks PFAS manufacturing facilities, it has contamination sources such as airports, military bases, and landfills. Most previous studies focused on areas with severe contamination, leaving uncertainty about PFAS exposure in general populations. They used data from the California Regional Exposure (CARE) study, a biomonitoring program assessing environmental chemical exposure across Eastern and Southern California. Blood samples were analyzed for 12 PFAS using advanced chromatography and mass-spectrometry methods with rigorous quality controls. Drinking-water data were obtained from the California State Water Resources Control Board's monitoring program (2019–2022), which tested public water systems, primarily untreated source wells with some post-treatment samples, for 18 PFAS compounds. Participant addresses were geocoded and matched to specific public water system boundaries to determine whether their water supply had detectable PFAS levels at State Consumer Confidence Report Detection Limits of 2–4 ng/L (for the modeled analytes, 4 ng/L). After excluding participants with private wells or missing data, 563 individuals were included in the final sample. Serum PFAS concentrations were compared across participants with and without PFAS detections in their local water systems, adjusting for race/ethnicity, sex, education, age, income, parity, and nativity. Among 563 adults from Southern California, the majority of participants were middle-aged women, with nearly 40% identifying as Hispanic and 54% primarily drinking tap water. PFAS were detected in almost all blood samples, with PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS being the most prevalent. Serum PFAS levels were generally lower than national averages but still indicated a potential for health effects in 86% of participants, according to National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) guidance. Seventy public water systems serving the study area had PFAS testing data, and 56% of participants were connected to systems in which at least one PFAS was detected. PFBS, PFHxS, PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxA were the most frequently detected chemicals, particularly in urban Southern California. Participants whose water systems had PFHxS detections exhibited 31.9% higher serum PFHxS concentrations, with even stronger associations when detections were frequent (≥50% of sampling locations, 64% higher). The association between drinking water and blood PFHxS was strongest among tap-water drinkers, while overall serum PFAS were lower among bottled-water drinkers, although some effect estimates for PFOS and ∑5 PFAS were approximately 20% higher but not statistically significant. These results indicate that even relatively low PFAS levels in drinking water contribute to measurable increases in blood PFAS concentrations. This study demonstrated that even at low environmental levels, PFAS in drinking water contribute to elevated blood concentrations, particularly for PFHxS, a compound with a long biological half-life. Compared with national and highly contaminated regions, PFAS levels in Southern California were lower but still of health concern. The strong link between PFHxS in drinking water and serum supports previous findings and highlights the legacy of aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) contamination. Strengths include robust linkage of biomonitoring data with statewide water-quality records and adjustment for key demographic variables. However, notable limitations included potential exposure misclassification from raw (pre-treatment) water data, the selection of larger or higher-risk systems that may bias associations upward, a temporal mismatch between some water sampling and serum collection, and a lack of information on other exposure routes (such as dust or diet). Despite these limitations, the findings emphasize that PFAS-contaminated drinking water remains a significant exposure pathway, even in non-industrial areas, reinforcing the need for stricter PFAS regulations, expanded monitoring, and improved water treatment across California.
