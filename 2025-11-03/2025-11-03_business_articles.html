                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cloud computing startup Lambda announced on Monday a multibillion-dollar deal with Microsoft for artificial intelligence infrastructure powered by tens of thousands of Nvidia chips. The agreement comes as Lambda benefits from surging consumer demand for AI-powered services, including AI chatbots and assistants, CEO Stephen Balaban told CNBC's "Money Movers" on Monday. "We're in the middle of probably the largest technology buildout that we've ever seen," Balaban said. "The industry is going really well right now, and there's just a lot of people who are using ChatGPT and Claude and the different AI services that are out there." Balaban said the partnership will continue the two companies' long-term relationship, which goes back to 2018. A specific dollar amount was not disclosed in the deal announcement. Founded in 2012, Lambda provides cloud services and software for training and deploying AI models, servicing over 200 thousand developers, and also rents out servers powered by Nvidia's graphics processing units. The new infrastructure with Microsoft will include the NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, which are also deployed by hyperscaler CoreWeave, according to a release. "We love Nvidia's product," Balaban said. The company has dozens of data centers and is planning to continue not only leasing data centers but also constructing its own infrastructure as well, Balaban said. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a letter to Elon Musk's automaker that the agency continued to receive complaints from Tesla owners after the regulators initiated a probe in September. Owners said they were unable to enter or exit their cars due to battery power loss and other situations impeding normal use of the doorhandles. In some cases, owners' children were trapped inside hot vehicles, requiring first responder interventions or breaking windows to open the doors. NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigations said they had "received 16 reports of exterior door handles becoming inoperative due to low 12VDC battery voltage in certain MY 2021 Tesla Model Y vehicles," as of October 27, 2025. The agency began the electronic door handles investigation into Tesla following a Bloomberg report bringing incidents to light. The news agency reported that people were injured or died after becoming trapped in Tesla vehicles after collisions or battery power losses that prevented doors from opening normally. Tesla design leader Franz Von Holzhausen has said in subsequent press interviews that the company would change the design of its door handles. Tesla competitors, including Rivian, are also reconsidering flush-mounted, or retractable door handle designs. Volkswagen CEO Thomas Schäfer recently said his company's customers don't even want the flush-mounted, electronic doorhandles and VW has no plans to adopt them. Meanwhile, China is expected to implement new vehicle safety standards around door handles, including a requirement to have more clearly marked, accessible and easier-to-use emergency, interior door release mechanisms. The NHTSA Tesla probe seeks records concerning all model year, "2021 Tesla Model Y vehicles manufactured for sale or lease in the United States," as well as "peer vehicles," including Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles from model years 2017 to 2022, and "systems related to opening doors including, door handles, door latches, 12VDC batteries, software," and other components. Tesla has until Dec. 10 to provide the records. While Tesla can seek an extension on the deadline from NHTSA, it may face fines of "$27,874 per violation per day, with a maximum of $139,356,994" if the company either fails to or refuses to "respond completely, accurately, or in a timely manner" to NHTSA's information requests, the agency cautioned in its letter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York Attorney General Letitia James and more than a dozen other state attorneys general on Monday sued the Trump administration over its new rule limiting eligibility for a popular student loan forgiveness program. The rule changes the definition of a "qualifying employer" under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to exclude certain organizations "that engage in unlawful activities" such as "supporting terrorism and aiding and abetting illegal immigration," according to an Education Department statement. PSLF, signed into law in 2007 by George W. Bush, offers debt cancellation after a decade to borrowers who work for non-profits and the government. "Public Service Loan Forgiveness was created as a promise to teachers, nurses, firefighters, and social workers that their service to our communities would be honored," said Attorney General James in a statement. In an email to CNBC, Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent called the rule "commonsense reform." More than 40 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. Over 9 million borrowers may be eligible for PSLF, according to a 2022 estimate from Protect Borrowers, a nonprofit focused on student loans. President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness efforts, which included making it easier to qualify for PSLF. Under President Joe Biden, more than 1 million people had their debts cleared under the program, according to a 2024 White House fact sheet. The lawsuit was brought by attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia. A coalition of cities across the U.S, labor unions and nonprofit organizations also filed a lawsuit on Monday against the Trump administration over its PSLF rule. "The Trump Administration's illegal actions threaten to make higher education even more expensive for Boston's teachers, first responders, and civil servants," said Boston Mayor Michelle Wu in a statement.

Julie Lennox's fascination with tiny homes began after she tore her ACL downhill skiing in 2019. "It made me a little bit obsessed with tiny homes," she said. But she didn't think seriously about shrinking her own footprint until 2021, when she and her former partner split up and sold their three-bedroom house in Missoula, Montana. A surge in demand for housing across the Mountain West had sent home values skyrocketing in Missoula, and Lennox couldn't afford much on the market. So she moved in with her parents on their 15-acre property just outside the city and began planning to build her own tiny home in their backyard. Lennox, the head of a local private school in Missoula, eventually settled on a prefabricated mobile tiny home built and delivered to her by a Canadian company, Teacup Tiny Homes, in 2022. Unlike a regular tiny home, the structure was built on a trailer chassis and sits permanently on wheels, so it can be towed and relocated to a different piece of land if needed. The tiny home on wheels, also known as a THOW, has allowed Lennox to significantly reduce her housing costs over the last three years. She's among a growing number of Americans, including older people who are downsizing, who are choosing this alternative form of housing. She estimates she spent another $15,000 installing a pad for the structure to sit on, building a porch around it, and hooking it up to water, sewer, and electricity. She didn't take out a mortgage; she used the cash from her home sale to cover all of her costs. These days, her housing costs are limited to utilities and home repairs, the latter of which she estimates she's spent less than $500 on over the last three years. Because the home is so small, Lennox said she spends only about $600 a year on propane, which she uses for cooking, to heat her home and water, and to power her dryer. This brings her average monthly housing costs to less than $200. But there's been a learning curve associated with tiny living. And her move required a fair amount of downsizing. But Lennox says that, these days, she doesn't miss any of her old stuff. It's just enough space for the two of them. The quarters also feel a bit more cramped when it's cold out. Her living space is larger in the warmer months, as she spends much of her time outside on her porch, surrounded by Ponderosa pines and Douglas-fir trees, with a view of the Blackfoot River.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump, who recently suggested he would be at the Supreme Court on Wednesday for oral arguments in the case that will determine the fate of many of his wide-ranging tariffs, now says he will not attend. "I will not be going to the Court on Wednesday in that I do not want to distract from the importance of this Decision," Trump wrote Sunday in a Truth Social post. "It will be, in my opinion, one of the most important and consequential Decisions ever made by the United States Supreme Court," he wrote. Trump said on Oct. 15 that if he loses the case, "we will be a weakened, troubled, financial mess for many, many years to come. If he had gone, Trump likely would have been the first sitting U.S. president to attend oral arguments at the Supreme Court. The Justice Department is asking the Supreme Court to reverse lower federal court rulings in two separate cases that found that Trump did not have the legal authority to impose so-called reciprocal tariffs on April 2 on imported goods from nearly every country in the world. The tariffs range from a baseline of 10% on many countries to as high as 50% on imported goods from Brazil and India. Also at stake in the case is the legality of separate "fentanyl tariffs" that Trump slapped on some imports from China, Canada and Mexico. On Sunday, Trump wrote, "If a President is not allowed to use Tariffs, we will be at a major disadvantage against all other Countries throughout the World, especially the 'Majors.' "In a true sense, we would be defenseless," he said. We want to hear from you.

OpenAI announced a $38 billion partnership with Amazon's AWS on Monday, its first major cloud computing deal since striking a new agreement with Microsoft that gave it more flexibility. Amazon shares were up more than 5% in premarket trading on the news. "AWS's leadership in cloud infrastructure combined with OpenAI's pioneering advancements in generative AI will help millions of users continue to get value from ChatGPT," the announcement said. OpenAI's new definitive agreement with Microsoft, announced last week as part of OpenAI's restructuring to a more traditional for-profit business, removed the tech giant's power to have first refusal on cloud computing deals. Microsoft, an early investor in OpenAI, now has a roughly 27% in OpenAI Group PBC, a newly formed for-profit public benefit corporation. "Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute," OpenAI co-CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. "Our partnership with AWS strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone." After starting last week with 14,000 layoffs, Amazon ended the week on a high note with third-quarter earnings topping expectations and disclosures about how the company has made progress on AI. With AI companies' valuations growing, along with their spending commitments, there's been growing concern on Wall Street over a possible bubble amid increasingly circular deal structures and dependencies between leading companies. During a recent livestream, Altman said there have been conversations around OpenAI about how to build a compute factory that would allow OpenAI to create 1 gigawatt of compute per week.</p>

The ship's fastest speed was a record-setting 35.2 knots, or a little over 40 miles per hour, in 1968. At 887 feet and 7 inches long, the USS New Jersey is almost three football fields long, and 5 feet longer than the Titanic. The USS New Jersey earned 19 battle stars throughout its career. After it was decommissioned for the last time, it was transformed into a museum based in its namesake state where visitors can explore spaces such as the combat engagement center, officers' staterooms, and gun turrets. "I've been here eight years now," Ryan Szimanski, curator of Battleship New Jersey, told Business Insider. "I still have not been in all 1,600 rooms." Take a look inside the USS New Jersey. The 45,000-ton ship cost around $150 million to build in the 1940s, or around $2 billion in 2025 when adjusted for inflation. Reagan was the first sitting president to commission a battleship. After serving in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf, it was decommissioned for the final time in 1991. The museum, operated by Battleship New Jersey, offers daily self-guided and guided tours. Tickets can be purchased through Battleship New Jersey. The USS New Jersey's shore bombardment capabilities made it irreplaceable from World War II through the 1980s. "Even though aircraft carriers rendered battleships obsolete nominally in World War II, in the '50s, they bring the ship back. Because to this day, we haven't developed a platform that can cheaply provide that shore bombardment," Szimanski said. The explosive rounds weighed 1,900 pounds and armor-piercing rounds weighed 2,700 pounds — about the same as a Kia Soul. The 16-inch guns could hit targets up to 23 miles away. "Pull the trigger on that," Szimanski said, pointing to a M2 Browning machine gun on the deck. Far be it from me to disobey a direct order. This particular gun was a replica, but visitors to the USS New Jersey can fire blanks from its 5-inch or 40mm saluting guns upon making a donation to the museum. The red line focuses on weapons and navigation, with stops like the combat engagement center and missile deck. Szimanski guided me through a combination of these routes for a broader look at the ship, but if you do all four as they're laid out, it's 1 ½ miles long and covers 200 of the ship's 1,600 rooms. The USS New Jersey was designed to hold 2,000 crew members, but during War War II, there were 2,700 sailors on board. When there weren't enough bunks, sailors slept in hammocks. Around 3,000 former crew members have visited the museum since it opened in 2001, Szimanski said. Officers were seated by rank and only began eating once the executive officer, or XO, gave the signal. Unlike enlisted crew members, officers paid for all of their meals. Reason told the museum that he read classified information at a desk in his bedroom, but otherwise spent most of his time working at a larger desk in the stateroom. The spacious room was meant to impress foreign leaders … and intimidate them. "It's very specifically placed right here so that when dignitaries come across the gangway, they have to walk past the gun turrets to get here," Szimanski said. It featured more modern equipment such as the Tomahawk Weapons System for launching Tomahawk missiles, and sensors including Air Search and Surface Search radars. Volunteers worked to make the CEC as realistic as possible with screens showing mock-ups of how the computers functioned. Much of this equipment is still used on modern Navy ships. Upon closer examination, the museum realized the keys had brass tags that read "nuclear PTF," which stands for "permission to fire." "The Navy just left the original keys on board, the museum had them, and we didn't know we had them for over 20 years," Szimanski said. A ladder leads from the admiral's state room up to the admiral's bridge for easy access. Only four officers have ever been promoted to five-star fleet admiral in the history of the Navy. Since Halsey held the title, no other officer has been promoted to that level. If the conning tower was damaged or destroyed during battle, there were three other places on board where the ship could be steered from. "That's the real genius of this ship, the level of redundancy that they built in," Szimanski said. "Okay, you might be able to shoot through this and knock that out, but we've got four backups or six backups. We've found one system so far that has at least 46 different backups." The USS New Jersey measures 11 stories high. The museum offers special 90-minute in-depth tours of Turret II, spanning five stories. "My favorite thing about the computer is in the 1980s, they looked at replacing it with a modern digital computer and they chose not to," Szimanski said. "The modern computer was as accurate, but it wasn't more accurate, so why waste the money? Plus, if we lose power because we've been hit by the enemy, the modern computer dies. A screen also showed video footage of the guns firing, making it feel even more realistic. The hallway featured equipment such as oxygen breathing apparatuses and doors leading to fire rooms and engine rooms. If a torpedo from an enemy ship penetrated the ship's multiple layers of steel — three layers on the bottom and five on the sides — crew members in the fire room could make a quick escape via this four-story ladder. "We are not allowed to run our radar, because if we did, all of the cable TV within 50 miles would go out," Szimanski said. Enlisted crew members were served in buffet-style lines on metal trays, unlike officers who ate on china and silver. Enlisted crew members could choose between the meal of the day, which would have been entrees like ginger pot roast or steak and lobster, or fast-food-style items such as pizza, hot dogs, and cheeseburgers, which were always available. They had around 12 minutes to eat their meals. Since the crew was so large, they ate in at least three shifts. The USS New Jersey usually had two chaplains on board — one Protestant and one Catholic — but the chapel was a non-denominational space that held worship services for other faiths, as well. Male crew members' hair was not allowed to be any longer than 3 inches. The ship's washing machines could wash 100 pounds of uniforms per load, and the dryers held 50 pounds each. In the brig, prisoners received one ration of bread and water per day and had to be escorted to the bathroom by a Marine. The USS New Jersey carried different aircraft throughout its years of service. During World War II, it deployed Kingfisher and Seahawk seaplanes to monitor the aim of the 16-inch guns. Helicopters replaced seaplanes in the Korean War, when a Sikorsky HO3S-1 Dragonfly helicopter known as the "Jersey Bounce" assisted with search-and-rescue missions. Why did the Navy phase out battleships? Szimanski said the answer was simple: Battleships have large-caliber guns and thick armor, but neither can withstand the impact of missiles. However, President Donald Trump has expressed interest in bringing battleships back. At the September all-hands meeting called by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth featuring 800 military leaders, Trump said that he'd spoken to Navy Secretary John Phelan and that it's "something we're seriously considering." "Some people would say, 'No, that's old technology.' I don't think it's old technology when you look at those guns," Trump said. In a statement to Business Insider, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said that "President Trump is prioritizing this vital industry to strengthen our country's economic and national security — including by securing a historic $43 billion shipbuilding investment in the Working Families Tax Cut." Destroyers are equipped with high-range guns and missiles. Long-range strikes are carried out by aircraft carriers. And submarines have filled the role of anti-surface warships. However, there's no vessel that can execute shore bombardment as effectively and efficiently as battleships did with their large artillery. That's why the USS New Jersey was brought out of retirement again and again after World War II — and why it would still serve as a crucial asset if the need arose. "If we got into another first-class shooting war, there's a strong chance that they would fire me and bring the ship back," Szimanski said. Update: November 3, 2025 — This story has been updated to include a statement from the White House.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI has signed a deal to buy $38 billion worth of capacity from Amazon Web Services, its first contract with the leader in cloud infrastructure and the latest sign that the $500 billion artificial intelligence startup is no longer reliant on Microsoft. Under the agreement announced on Monday, OpenAI will immediately begin running workloads on AWS infrastructure, tapping hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) in the U.S., with plans to expand capacity in the coming years. The first phase of the deal will use existing AWS data centers, and Amazon will eventually build out additional infrastructure for OpenAI. "It's completely separate capacity that we're putting down," said Dave Brown, vice president of compute and machine learning services at AWS, in an interview. OpenAI has been on a dealmaking spree of late, announcing roughly $1.4 trillion worth of buildout agreements with companies including Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle and Google — prompting skeptics to warn of an AI bubble and question whether the country has the power and resources needed to turn the ambitious promises into reality. Until this year, OpenAI had an exclusive cloud agreement with Microsoft, which first backed the company in 2019 and has invested a total of $13 billion. In January, Microsoft said it would no longer be the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI, and was moving to an arrangement where it would have right of first refusal for new requests. Last week, Microsoft's preferential status expired under its newly negotiated commercial terms with OpenAI, freeing the ChatGPT creator to partner more widely with the other hyperscalers. Even before that, OpenAI forged cloud deals with Oracle and Google, but AWS is by far the market leader. "Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in Monday's release. "Our partnership with AWS strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone." OpenAI will still be spending heavily with Microsoft, reaffirming that commitment by saying last week that it will purchase an incremental $250 billion of Azure services. Amazon has invested billions of dollars in Anthropic, and is currently constructing an $11 billion data center campus in New Carlisle, Indiana, that's designed exclusively for Anthropic workloads. "The breadth and immediate availability of optimized compute demonstrates why AWS is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI's vast AI workloads," AWS CEO Matt Garman said in the release. In its earnings report last week, Amazon reported more than 20% year-over-year revenue growth at AWS, beating analyst estimates. The current agreement with OpenAI is explicitly for use of Nvidia chips, including two popular Blackwell models, but there's potential to incorporate additional silicon down the road. Amazon's custom-built Trainium chip is being used by Anthropic in the new facility. "We like Trainium because we're able to give customers something that gives them better price performance and honestly gives them choice," Brown said, adding that he can't provide any details on "anything we've done with OpenAI on Trainium at this point." The infrastructure will support both inference — such as powering ChatGPT's real-time responses — and training of next-generation frontier models. OpenAI can expand with AWS as needed over the next seven years, but no plans beyond 2026 have been finalized. OpenAI's foundation models, including so-called open-weight options, are already available on Bedrock, AWS's managed service for accessing leading AI systems. Altman acknowledged in a recent livestream that an IPO is "the most likely path" given OpenAI's capital needs. CFO Sarah Friar has echoed that sentiment, framing the recent corporate restructuring as a necessary step toward going public.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kimberly-Clark announced Monday it's struck an agreement to buy Kenvue in a deal valued at $48.7 billion that would create a consumer staples giant. The deal is a combination of cash and stock and totals about $40 billion on an equity basis, excluding the impact of debt. Shares of Kenvue surged 15% Monday, while Kimberly-Clark stock fell 13%. The combined company would bring together brands like Huggies and Kleenex with the likes of Band-Aid and Tylenol. It would include 10 billion-dollar brands, the companies said in a news release. Kimberly-Clark Chairman and CEO Mike Hsu said in a statement that the companies share a "commitment to developing science and technology to provide extraordinary care." "Over the last several years, Kimberly-Clark has undertaken a significant transformation to pivot our portfolio to higher-growth, higher-margin businesses while rewiring our organization to work smarter and faster," Hsu said. "We have built the foundation and this transaction is a powerful next step in our journey." Kenvue, a portfolio of consumer health brands, spun out of Johnson & Johnson in May 2023, marking the biggest shake-up in J&J's nearly 140-year history. Since then, Kenvue shares have fallen almost 35% from their initial public offering price. The deal comes just weeks after President Donald Trump made unfounded claims linking the use of acetaminophen — the active ingredient in Tylenol — during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism, sending Kenvue's stock sharply lower. The company has staunchly pushed back against his administration's accusation, and many medical experts say Tylenol is often the safest and only option for pain and fever relief in pregnant women. Acetaminophen is used by upward of 100 million Americans annually. Kenvue Chair Larry Merlo said in a statement that following a comprehensive strategic review, the board is "confident this combination represents the best path forward for our shareholders and all other stakeholders." Hsu will continue to serve as chairman and CEO. The combined company would generate estimated 2025 annual net revenue of roughly $32 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of approximately $7 billion, according to the release. Tariffs imposed by Trump's administration have challenged the industry and its profits as key commodities like pulp, which is used to make tissues and diapers, grow more expensive. At the beginning of 2025, Kimberly-Clark stopped making private-label diapers for Costco to focus on more premium brands that command higher margins. In June, the company sold a majority stake in its international tissue business to Brazilian pulp maker Suzano. The resulting joint venture is intended to shield Kimberly-Clark from volatile input costs and help stabilize its margins. Once the deal closes, Kimberly-Clark will own health-care brands like Sudafed and Pepcid, once again pitting the company against rival Procter & Gamble, which has a health-care division that includes Pepto-Bismol and Vicks. But even with Kimberly-Clark's blockbuster acquisition, P&G still dwarfs its rival in both enterprise value and annual revenue. P&G has a market cap of about $350 billion. Last year, candy maker Mars announced plans to buy Kellanova, a snacking-centric spinoff of Kellogg, while Ferrero bought W.K.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft said Monday it has secured export licenses to ship Nvidia chips to the United Arab Emirates in a move that could accelerate the Gulf's lofty AI ambitions. The tech giant said it is the first company under U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to secure such licenses from the Commerce Department and that the approval, granted in September, was based on "updated and stringent technology safeguards." "While the chips are powerful and the numbers are large, more important is their positive impact across the UAE," Microsoft said in a blog post. "We're using these GPUs to provide access to advanced AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source providers, and Microsoft itself." Azad Zangana, head of GCC macroeconomic analysis at Oxford Economics, said in a note that Nvidia's chips are "crucial" for the UAE's push to be a major global player in AI. "Access to the world's leading AI chips provides the hardware that will give developers the leading edge that is needed in an incredibly competitive global landscape," Zangana wrote. There is a "very important" relationship between the UAE and U.S. governments that has spanned multiple administrations, Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNBC's Dan Murphy at the ADIPEC conference in Abu Dhabi. "That builds as well on the relationships we had with Secretary [Marco] Rubio when he was in the Senate and Democrats as well. [It] takes two parties to govern, and we keep that in mind." Microsoft also announced it will be increasing its investment in UAE, bringing its total contribution to $15.2 billion by the end of this decade. That includes a $1.5 billion equity investment in AI firm G42 and more than $5.5 billion in capital expenses for the expansion of Microsoft's AI and cloud infrastructure projects in the region. "We're really investing in trust, and I think it's that combination of technology, talent and trust that you're seeing come together here in the UAE, around AI, around technology, but really the future of the whole economy," Smith said. — CNBC's Dan Murphy contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Europe's biggest carmakers rose Monday as fears over an industry shortage of semiconductors appeared to recede. China on Saturday said it would consider some exemptions for Nexperia chip exports. It had previously blocked Nexperia semiconductors from leaving the country after the Dutch government seized control of Nexperia, owned by the Chinese company Wingtech. France's Renault, Germany's Mercedes-Benz Group and Milan-listed shares of Jeep maker Stellantis were all trading up around 3% on Monday morning. Auto parts suppliers Valeo and Aumovio had advanced 3% and 1.6%, respectively, by around 11:30 a.m. London time (6:30 a.m. Germany's Volkswagen, Porsche and BMW were also trading more than 1.3% higher. Analysts at Barclays said developments over the weekend appeared to be "quite positive" for the automotive sector, with fears of significant disruption likely to be avoided. "While the Nexperia issue is not fully resolved, with ongoing negotiations between the Dutch and Chinese government to determine a path forward for Nexperia, we believe the potential near-term production headwind has been remediated, although we await more details," Dan Levy, senior autos analyst at Barclays, said in a research note published Monday. In making the decision, the Dutch government cited fears that technology from the company — which specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries — "would become unavailable in an emergency." China responded by blocking exports of the firm's finished products. German automakers are thought to be especially sensitive to Nexperia-related disruptions because they rely heavily on large, domestic suppliers, known as "Tier 1s," and local production facilities and companies, such as Nexperia, despite much of its manufacturing moving to China. Japan's Honda Motor became the first known automaker to reduce production due to the problem last week. We want to hear from you.

Between billion-dollar investments and global market shocks, partners at Goldman Sachs have no shortage of things to worry about. But two of them share a common nighttime preoccupation. "I'm always thinking about our people," said Lakdawala-Flynn, who has been at the firm for more than 25 years and became a partner in 2014. She added that having a "rotating door" makes it more difficult to create strong businesses and client solutions. Lakdawala-Flynn manages teams of private wealth advisors, who themselves work with the bank's ultra-high-net-worth clients. As of late last year, Goldman had 39 private wealth management offices around the world. Pompey, who is nearing two decades at Goldman and became a partner in 2018, also said "our people." "You have the careers of all these individuals in your hands," she said. "Are you doing the very best you can to amplify their talents, give them the opportunities that they need to succeed? Goldman is about to announce its next class of managing directors, who sit one rung below partners in the firm's leadership hierarchy. The bank has come under scrutiny in recent years for an exodus of female leadership and a general lack of women in the most senior positions. Yesterday, CEO David Solomon said Goldman had "made a bunch of progress, especially in the senior ranks, but candidly not enough, and we continue to be focused on creating opportunities." Pompey also said that she still worries about the little things when trying to fall asleep.</p>

Here's the reality in 2025: you can lose your job with no warning. I've worked in tech for the past four years, and during that time, I've witnessed thousands of layoffs and reorganizations. This week, Amazon announced that it will lay off up to 30,000 employees this year, and 14,000 have been let go already. My recommendation is that you make this a standard practice every month or two. A year from now, it may be hard to remember who that colleague was who told you that you were the best project manager they ever worked with. Record the names and contact info of colleagues you've worked with, along with a few notes on how you worked together. Screenshot a shoutout from an executive and download performance reviews. You can use this to help you think through examples for interviews, and it can even serve as motivation and a reminder of your impact. You'll want these data points for your résumé and interviews, and saving them along the way will make it much easier than having to hunt them down once you've left your workplace. Some job applications require you to share a portfolio or samples of your work. Many of us use our work emails for work-related accounts, such as LinkedIn. Make sure you add a personal email address as well — this will be helpful for accessing these accounts should you be laid off. You can always update these after a layoff, but if you make a habit of updating them regularly, it will be far easier to kick off your job search than if this becomes another task that you have to take on during a time of stress. If you have already been laid off, give yourself time to grieve and process your emotions. Layoffs are traumatic, and you will need time to recover before starting your job search. Make sure you understand the details of your severance package. There may be requirements to receive your full package, or it may be more beneficial to negotiate some portions. Many service providers have programs for those who are unemployed — you may be able to get a forbearance on student loans, a pause on car loans or your mortgage, or some relief on your interest rates for a credit card. Most people probably don't know what you do, but if you share a bit about job titles and industries that are a good match and let them know you're seeking referrals, they may be able to help as well. Many find that a job search can take more than six months in 2025, so the more you're able to prepare yourself, the better your chances are of navigating that period successfully.</p>

But when a 2023 video of his wife sharing a toddler playtime hack at the beach went viral, he was suddenly thrust into social media stardom. Now Vargas is on a mission to help other service members cash in too. "It's taken away the fear and anxiety that I previously had with swiping a debit card or swiping a credit card or opening up my bank app," he said. He's also part of a top-level Army pilot program that partners with soldier-influencers to help the Army recruit more young people online. (That program was recently paused for a legal review.) If you are serving or have served and want to share your experience with social media and the military, contact this reporter by email at kbaker@insider.com or on Signal at kelseybaker75.75. Today, he reaches about 25 million views a month on TikTok and Instagram, with more than 270,000 followers across social platforms. Vargas has faced criticism from some who say he profits from his uniform, blurring the line between his military role and personal brand. "It can look bad to some people, but social media has changed my life and my family's life financially and career-wise," he said. Vargas declined to share exactly how much he earns as a creator, but said the new income has transformed his family's finances. Most platforms pay on a scale that can vary drastically depending on reach, content, and audience demographics — a metric known as "revenue per mile." Some videos might bring in $30, while others generate several hundred dollars. Vargas has been on active duty for nearly 13 years — most recently as a cavalry scout at Fort Hood, Texas. Social media started as a side hustle, and it now rivals his military career in terms of time commitment, he said. Most soldiers with similar rank, experience, and family size typically earn around $8,000 a month, or nearly $98,000 yearly, according to a government military pay calculator. He started by posting funny skits and "top five" lists before finding a niche in military news. Vargas' recent posts have highlighted pay changes for troops and potential privatization of military grocery stores. Other videos rib top enlisted leaders for the services. His explainer videos on military peculiarities are especially popular. Troops are hungry for news about the military, Vargas said. That hunger for information reflects a wider decline in the availability of military-focused journalism. Vargas doesn't view himself as a journalist; he just values good storytelling and raising awareness. "Between those three pillars, I've been able to create this business, but also protect the authenticity of my story and my words." Because military guidelines prohibit government employees from receiving compensation tied to their official name, image, and likeness, he typically appears in civilian clothes to draw a line between his military job and personal work. Each video takes roughly 90 minutes to produce, between filming, shooting, editing, and uploading. He handles almost everything himself, though a remote assistant helps with admin and responding to DMs. Recently, Vargas branched out into consulting, joining a wave of creators helping companies reach younger consumers. He works with a handful of financial companies and several nonprofits, billing by the hour to help sharpen their messaging. The military is still trying to figure out how to treat employee influencers like Vargas who build online audiences while serving on active duty. Monetization in social media, in particular, is a major gray area for the Army, said Col. Kris Saling, an Army talent management expert who oversees eight influencers, part of a Pentagon program aiming to boost recruitment. "These guys drive engagement, and they drive positive engagement in a way that we haven't seen, both for recruiting and just for general Army content development," she said of the group of influencers. "And the ROI is one we can't ignore." "We can figure something out" to help keep military influencers in compliance with Pentagon rules, she said. "We just don't know what that is yet." As his following has grown, Vargas has created an LLC, works with a military lawyer to ensure that he operates within the military justice system, and hired a civilian lawyer to help defend everything he's built. "I would love, more than anything, for every service member to have access to making even an extra, like, $20,000 a year," he said. "I feel like that would change so many lives."</p>
