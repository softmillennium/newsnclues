Firefighters work on a medieval tower Torre dei Conti near the Roman Forum after it had partially collapsed during renovation works, meters away from the Colosseum in Rome, Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. ROME (AP) — Firefighters worked to rescue a worker trapped for hours beneath the rubble of a medieval tower that partially collapsed while under renovation in the heart of Italy's capital on Monday, critically injuring another worker. Firefighters faced a complex task as the structure continued to give way as they tried to get near the trapped worker through a first-floor window, forcing their retreat on telescopic aerial ladders in a cloud of smoke. Another approach on two ladders was also aborted, and a drone sent up in their stead. As dusk approached, firefighters lifted on a crane used giant tubes to suck rubble out of the second-floor window. Three workers were rescued unharmed after the initial midday collapse, said firefighter spokesperson Luca Cari. Italian media reported that another worker, age 64, was hospitalized in critical condition but there was no immediate update on his condition. No firefighters were injured in the ongoing operation. Rome's top law enforcement official, Prefect Lamberto Giannini, said there were “signs of life” from the trapped worker, and that firefighters had managed to give him some protective cover during an earlier rescue attempt. This combo of three pictures shows a cloud of debris from a second collapse surrounding firefighters who were trying to rescue a worker after a medieval tower near the Roman Forum partially collapsed during renovation work, in Rome, Italy, Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. Giannini called the situation “very complex” and said that other equipment was being brought in. Hundreds of tourists had assembled to watch as firefighters used a mobile ladder to bring a stretcher to the upper level of the Torre dei Conti during the first rescue attempt. Suddenly, another part of the structure partially collapsed, sending up a cloud of debris and forcing firefighters to quickly descend on the ladder. Queen Paglinawan was working in a nearby gelato parlor when she heard the two loud noises from the town in quick succession. “I was working and then I heard something falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way,'' Paglinawan, 27, said as yet another collapse occurred in the background. The Torre dei Conti was built in the 13th century by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his family. Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri and Italian Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli were at the scene, but did not speak to reporters. We are worried for the worker who remains trapped,'' said Federico Mollicone, chairman of the parliamentary culture committee.</p>

Fox News Digital spoke with Sandra Awodele, the creator behind COI Traveler, about what Americans should be wary of ahead of their summer travels to Mexico. The U.S. State Department has issued an increased travel advisory pertaining to Tanzania, adding an "unrest" risk indicator. The Level 2 advisory was increased to Level 3 on Oct. 31, following the presidential, Parliament and council elections there. "Reconsider travel to Tanzania due to unrest, crime, terrorism and targeting of gay and lesbian individuals," the advisory says. The State Department has warned that demonstrations can be unpredictable, and the Tanzanian government has increased security presence around protests. People who identify as gay or lesbian may experience a higher likelihood of being targeted by police," the advisory says. The State Department upgraded Tanzania to a Level 3 travel advisory, citing unrest, crime and terrorism risks. The advisory adds, "People detained under suspicion of same-sex sexual conduct may face invasive physical exams." Violent crime is also listed as common; the advisory mentioned the risk of robberies, assault and sexual assault. The State Department also says there's a risk of "terrorist violence," stating that it is most common in the Mtwara Region. Over two million people traveled to Tanzania in 2024, according to the Tanzania National Bureau of Statistics. It's known for its 25,000 large animals, with over 1 million wildebeest and 72,000 zebras, according UNESCO World Heritage. Officials advise travelers to have an emergency escape plan "that does not depend on U.S. government help." Travelers should "keep a low profile," stay aware of their surroundings, should not leave food or drinks unattended, and "avoid public displays of affection, particularly between same-sex couples." Over two million people traveled to Tanzania in 2024. The State Department has four travel advisory levels to help travelers assess safety risks before visiting other countries. Ashley J.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Both Christians and Muslims — the two main religious groups in the country of more than 230 million people — have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists, they say. The West African nation has grappled for years with deep-rooted security problems that are driven by various factors, including religiously motivated attacks. The Nigerian government rejects claims that it is not doing enough to protect Christians from violence, saying it was bewildered by Trump's suggestion of a potential military intervention. “We are shocked that President Trump is mulling an invasion of our country,” Nigerian presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga told CNN after the US president instructed the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action. As Trump's war threats echo among Nigerians, his assertion that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” has provoked strong reactions from many within the country. John Joseph Hayab, a pastor who leads the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the country's northern region, where attacks by Islamist groups are prevalent, told CNN that he agrees with Trump's claim of “systematic killings of Christians” in that area. Hayab said he had presided over numerous mass burials of slain Christians, stating that “every state in northern Nigeria has suffered its own terrible share of killings targeting Christians.” Trump says he's ordered Pentagon to ‘prepare for possible action' in Nigeria Some analysts argue that while Christians have been targeted by Boko Haram and other Islamist groups seeking to impose their extreme interpretation of Islamic law, Muslims, including those considered moderate, have also been victims of those groups. Bulama Bukarti, a Nigerian human rights advocate specializing in security and development, disputed Trump's comments, telling CNN that they “reflect a dangerous oversimplification of Nigeria's complex security crisis.” Northern Nigeria has witnessed horrific killings targeting religious groups this year. Pope Leo XIV offered prayers for the victims of the Yelwata attack, many of whom were “internally displaced persons sheltered by a local Catholic mission,” a Vatican news report said. Muslims have also been victims of targeted killings this year. Trump's rhetoric (suggesting a mass slaughter of Christians) not only misinforms the international community but also risks fuelling extremist propaganda and undermining local efforts to build peace,” he added. Armed Conflict Location & Event Data, a crisis-monitoring group, reported that more than 20,400 civilians were killed in attacks in Nigeria between January 2020 and September of this year. Security analyst Nnamdi Obasi, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group think tank, explained that while extremist groups have wreaked havoc against both Christians and Muslims in the northeast of Nigeria, bandit groups have terrorized predominantly Muslim communities in the northwest. Additionally, predominantly Christian farming communities in parts of the North Central zone have suffered persistent violence from armed groups. However, “in most parts of the country, Christians and Muslims live peacefully with each other,” he said. Gunmen kill at least 20 people in gold mining village of Nigeria's Zamfara state Ken Eluma Asogwa, a spokesperson for the opposition Labour Party, told CNN that “even though the government of Nigeria has been lackluster and shambolic in its approach to the protection of its citizens from murderous non-state actors operating under different aliases, there is no evidence to support Trump's claims that Christians are particularly targeted for extermination.” On Friday, Trump designated Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” under the US International Religious Freedom Act. The label is a suggestion that his administration has found that Nigeria has engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, (and) egregious violations of religious freedom.” Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has so far remained silent about Trump's mention of potential military intervention but pushed back against the designation, stating in a social media post that “the characterization of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.” Trump has not ruled out the possibility of sending US troops to Nigeria or launching airstrikes in the country, telling reporters on Sunday, “I envisage a lot of things.” But analyst Obasi said that any unilateral US military operation against Islamist groups in Nigeria would not address the underlying factors driving instability there. Such an intervention, he said, “without the involvement of Nigerian security forces, would be predictably unwelcome by many Nigerians and could further destabilize the country, aggravating its security situation.” “It should meet misinformation with data,” he suggested, adding that “this moment calls for candor, not posturing.” “Constructive dialogue, not social-media outrage, will best serve Nigeria's interests — and the cause of peace,” he advised.</p>

The Senate returns to Washington, D.C., this week as the government shutdown nears a record-shattering milestone and as lawmakers remain entrenched in their positions. Still, there was newfound optimism among some lawmakers as bipartisan talks increased last week, and many hope that same momentum carries into this week. But for now, neither side is budging from the positions they've maintained since Oct. 1, when the shutdown officially began. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and his Democratic caucus want a deal on expiring Obamacare premium subsidies before they agree to reopen the government. Saturday was when open enrollment officially began nationwide. They've long warned that unless a deal was made before open enrollment, Americans that rely on the subsidies would see their premiums spike, despite the subsidies not expiring until the end of this year. "People are going to see drastic, drastic increases in their healthcare costs," Schumer said last week. "People are going to sit at the dinner table Friday night with a pit, with a hole in the pit of their stomach, and say, ‘How are we going to do this?'" President Donald Trump looks on as he speaks to members of the media on board Air Force One en route to Joint Base Andrews, Nov. 2, 2025. Senate Republicans largely agree that there needs to be an extension of some kind to the subsidies, but they also want a host of reforms made to the program that was enhanced under former President Joe Biden. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has offered Senate Democrats a vote on the Obamacare subsidies, but they say that's not enough and demand that President Donald Trump get involved. While Schumer and his Democratic caucus' demands have remained laser-focused on expiring Obamacare subsidies, they have also blamed Trump for not funding federal food benefits as he did in 2019, and Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., have called for a meeting with the president. Senate Majority Leader John Thune speaks during a press conference with Senate Republican leadership following a policy luncheon on Capitol Hill in Washington, Oct. 28, 2025. But Trump won't meet with the top congressional Democrats until the shutdown ends — a point he and Republicans have made time and time again. And he won't budge on healthcare negotiations until the government reopens, either. "I'm not going to do it by being extorted by the Democrats who have lost their way," Trump said on CBS' "60 Minutes." Meanwhile, Trump has urged Senate Republicans to get rid of the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the upper chamber. Doing so is a proverbial third rail for Senate Republicans and a longstanding priority for Senate Democrats. He renewed that call over the weekend in posts on Saturday and Sunday to his social media platform Truth Social. Alex Miller is a writer for Fox News Digital covering the U.S. Senate.

Retired FBI special agent Jason Pack breaks down three key issues investigators will be looking at regarding the explosion at Harvard University's medical school on 'Fox Report.' Two suspects in the weekend explosion at Harvard Medical School in Boston remain on the run Monday as police declared it safe for students and faculty to return to campus. Two masked suspects were seen fleeing from the building after the blast went off in a small section of the fourth-floor hallway, Harvard officials said in an update on Sunday. It added that the building did not sustain any structural damage and all labs and equipment remained intact. Harvard University Police Department (HUPD) confirmed there was no continued public safety threat and said it was safe to return to campus, university officials said in the update. HUPD on Saturday released surveillance photos of two suspects wearing masks and head coverings fleeing the building at the time of the blast. No one was injured in the explosion, officials have said. The Boston Fire Department Arson Unit responded and made an initial assessment that the explosion appeared to be intentional, officials previously said, and they believe a single device to be involved. The Boston Police Department conducted a sweep of the building to check for any additional devices, and none were found. Fox News Digital's Alexandra Koch contributed to this report.

Fox News senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse reports on a suspect crashing into actress Jennifer Aniston's front gate. Jennifer Aniston is smitten with her love, Jim Curtis. On Sunday, the "Friends" star, 56, took to social media to give Curtis a birthday shout-out while sharing a sweet, coupled-up photo of the two of them. "Happy birthday my love," she wrote on Instagram, alongside a black-and-white photo of herself wrapping her arms around Curtis' waist. Close friends and fans of Aniston were quick to chime in. Jennifer Aniston confirmed her romance with Jim Curtis by sharing a cozy photo of the pair on Instagram. Stars like Leslie Mann, Jenna Dewan and Miranda Kerr commented with heart emojis, while former "Bachelorette" Kaitlyn Bristowe wrote, "FINE I BELIEVE IN LOVE." "This version of you is my fav!" A post shared by Jennifer Aniston (@jenniferaniston) In July, Aniston and Curtis were seen enjoying a day at sea aboard a yacht off the coast of Mallorca, Spain. In a photo, Aniston gently placed her hand on Curtis' hand, while he had his arm around her waist. The couple were accompanied by actor Jason Bateman, his wife, Amanda Anka, and Amy Schumer. Aniston was photographed with Curtis while aboard a yacht over the summer. "They've been seeing each other for a few months now," another source told the outlet. "They were introduced by a friend and started out as friends. They are dating, but it's still casual." "She's been happy on her own, but she's also open to sharing her life with someone. Curtis, a life coach who specializes in hypnotherapy, is "very different from anyone she's dated before," the insider said. According to Curtis' Instagram, the author's "mission is to help you heal and thrive by upgrading your I AM." When Curtis was 22 years old, he found out he had lesions on his spinal cord, which led to years of chronic pain. He told Fast Company during an interview in 2018, "It was unknown how they started, but I very rapidly became ill and soon had trouble walking." He spoke to the outlet about hiding his illness from his co-workers while he worked on Wall Street, a job that Curtis said "couldn't have been a worse choice" with his condition. "I had to stand up in a crowd all day. It was super high-stress, which is inflammatory and devastating for a condition like mine. "My own illness and disability forced me to confront the limited beliefs, disconnection and trauma that was keeping me sad, sick and alone," he wrote on his website. "My health journey has been my greatest teacher in developing a life of higher connection, purpose and love. Through many powerful tools including hypno-realization - I not only transformed my physical health, depression and relationships, I've helped thousands of others break free to create an entirely new reality full of connection, community and love."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Extra Strength Tylenol is shown in Carmel, Ind., Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025. Kimberly-Clark is buying Tylenol maker Kenvue in a cash and stock deal worth about $48.7 billion, creating a massive consumer health goods company. bout 46% in what is one of the largest corporate takeovers this year. The combined company will have a huge stable of household brands under one roof, putting Kenvue's Listerine mouthwash and Band-Aid side-by-side with Kimberly-Clark's Cottonelle toilet paper, Huggies and Kleenex tissues. It will also generate about $32 billion in annual revenue. Kenvue has spent a relatively brief period as an independent company, having been spun off by Johnson & Johnson two years ago. J&J first announced in late 2021 that it was splitting its slow-growth consumer health division from the pharmaceutical and medical device divisions. Kenvue has since been targeted by activist investors unhappy about the trajectory of the company and Wall Street appeared to anticipate some heavy lifting ahead for Kimberly-Clark. Kenvue and Tylenol have been thrust into the national spotlight this year as President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoted unproven and in some cases discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and the complex brain disorder autism. Trump then urged pregnant women against using the medicine. That went beyond Food and Drug Administration advice that doctors “should consider minimizing” the painkiller acetaminophen's use in pregnancy — amid inconclusive evidence about whether too much could be linked to autism. Kennedy reiterated the FDA guidance during a press conference last week. Kenvue has continued to push back on the Trump administration's dialogue. “Nothing is more important to us than the health and safety of the people who use our products,” Kenvue said in a statement on its website. “We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with allegations that it does and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents.” In July Kenvue, announced that CEO Thibaut Mongon was leaving in the midst of a strategic review with the company under mounting pressure from activist investors. Kimberly-Clark Chairman and CEO Mike Hsu will be chairman and CEO of the combined company. The combined company will keep Kimberly-Clark's headquarters in Irving, Texas, but there will be significant operations around Kenvue facilities and locations as well. Kenvue shareholders will receive $3.50 per share in cash and 0.14625 Kimberly-Clark shares for each Kenvue share held at closing. Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue said that they identified about $1.9 billion in cost savings that are expected in the first three years after the transaction's closing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel's military said the Red Cross has handed over the remains of three hostages in Gaza and they will be taken to the Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv for identification. Red Cross vehicles carrying the bodies of three people believed to be deceased hostages handed over by Hamas make their way toward the border crossing with Israel, to be transferred to Israeli authorities, in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, Sunday, Nov. 2, 2025. This undated photo provided by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum shows hostage Omer Neutra, who was abducted and brought to Gaza in the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023. This undated photo provided by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum shows hostage Oz Daniel, who was abducted and brought to Gaza in the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Bodies of unidentified Palestinians returned from Israel as part of the ceasefire deal are brought to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. Palestinian women mourn over the body of Jamil Hanani, 17, who, according to health authorities, was killed after being shot in the chest during an Israeli raid, at his funeral in the West Bank village of Beit Furik, Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. Since the truce took effect on Oct. 10, Palestinian militants have released the remains of 20 hostages, with eight now remaining in Gaza. For each hostage returned, Israel has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians. Forensic work is complicated by a lack of DNA testing kits in Gaza, it added. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ‘s office identified the three hostages, whose bodies were returned to Israel on Sunday night, as Capt. A Hamas statement earlier said their remains were found on Sunday in a tunnel in southern Gaza. Neutra was 21 when Hamas militants abducted his tank crew during the 2023 attack. U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday he had spoken with Neutra's family. “They were thrilled, in one sense, but in another sense, obviously, it's not too great,” Trump said. Hamami, commander of Israel's southern brigade in the Gaza division, was killed during the 2023 attack while fighting to defend Kibbutz Nirim and his body was taken into the Palestinian territory. Militants have released one to three bodies every few days. Israel has pushed to speed up the returns and in certain cases has said the remains were not those of hostages. Hamas has said the work is complicated by widespread devastation. A political scandal continued to rock Israel involving the military's former legal chief, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, who admitted to leaking a video of Israeli soldiers sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee and resigned from office. Far-right politician Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's national security minister, said Tomer-Yerushalmi was arrested Sunday night. At a court hearing Monday, the judge extended her detention by 48 hours until Wednesday, according to a copy of the decision. Police conducted a frantic search for Tomer-Yerushalmi on Sunday after her family raised concerns about her safety and police found her abandoned car near the beach in Tel Aviv, Israel's Channel 12 reported. Police said she was found soon after the search began. Israeli media reported that former chief military prosecutor Col. Matan Solomesh was also arrested overnight and his detention was also extended. Two Palestinians, one of them a teenager, were killed by Israeli gunfire Sunday night in separate incidents in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah. Israel's military said soldiers opened fire at Palestinians hurling rocks, hitting one person. Also Sunday, Ahmed Al-Atrash, 32, was fatally shot by an Israeli settler at an entrance to the city of Hebron, the ministry said. Hundreds of hard-line settlers live in fortified enclaves under military protection in the city of more than 200,000 Palestinians. U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper will be in Jordan on Monday, with plans to visit a warehouse where British aid remains stuck waiting to enter Gaza. Ahead of the visit, Cooper said that “humanitarian support is desperately needed and the people of Gaza cannot afford to wait.” Cooper also announced that Britain will provide an extra 6 million pounds ($7.9 million) of humanitarian support for Gaza, provided by the U.N. Population Fund. Also Monday, Gaza's Health Ministry announced that a campaign to vaccinate some 40,000 Palestinian children under 3 years old against preventable diseases like measles, polio and meningitis will kick off next week. It will focus on children who missed routine vaccinations or received only partial doses due to the war, Dr. Nedal Ghoneim, the Health Ministry's public health manager, told the AP. The Hamas-led attack on southern Israel two years ago killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 68,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts. Israel, which has denied accusations by a U.N. commission of inquiry and others of committing genocide in Gaza, has disputed the ministry's figures without providing a contradicting toll.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A witness of a mass stabbing on a London-bound train has described how she fled through carriages to escape the attack, saying she didn't know if she'd be the next to be stabbed.

Armed police officers go on patrol at St Pancras International train station in London, England, Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. Police officers patrol King's Cross train station, in London, Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. LONDON (AP) — U.K. police on Monday charged a 32-year-old man with attempted murder over a mass stabbing attack on a train that wounded 11 people, and revealed that he may have stabbed two other people in the 24 hours before the attack. He is also charged with attempted murder over an earlier incident at Pontoon Dock light rail station in London just before 1 a.m. on Saturday, in which a victim “suffered facial injuries after being attacked with a knife” by an assailant who fled the scene. Police say they are not treating the train stabbings as an act of terror and are not looking for other suspects. Flanked by four security officers as he stood in the dock wearing a gray prison tracksuit and handcuffs, was ordered detained until his next hearing on Dec. 1. The charge of actual bodily harm is for allegedly hitting a police officer and breaking his nose after Williams' arrest. The minutes-long stabbing attack spree spread fear and panic through a train bound from Doncaster in northern England to London on Saturday evening. The train was about halfway through its journey and had just departed from a stop at Peterborough when police began receiving calls about people being stabbed onboard. The most seriously wounded victim is a member of train staff who tried to stop the attacker and suffered “grievous injuries,” Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said. He is hospitalized in critical but stable condition. Today he is a hero and forever will be,” Mahmood told lawmakers in the House of Commons. Four other victims remained in a hospital on Monday, including Jonathan Gjoshe, a player with soccer team Scunthorpe United. The team said he has “non-life threatening injuries.” Williams was arrested when the train made an emergency stop in the town of Huntingdon, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) north of London. Police say he was detained within eight minutes of officers receiving the first emergency calls. Authorities said the attack was an isolated incident but stepped up security on the railway, with armed police officers on patrol Monday at major train stations. The government rejected calls for increased security measures such as airport-style passenger and baggage screening to be introduced at Britain's 3,500 railway stations, saying that wouldn't be “proportionate or practical.” In the U.K, which has strict gun-control laws, almost half of all homicides involve a knife or sharp instrument. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's center-left government has pledged to reduce knife crime and has tightened rules for purchasing knives and banned some kinds of blades.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No, I did not prepare for the end of Daylight Saving Time this past weekend, when most US states set clocks back an hour. Sunrise and sunset now come an hour earlier, despite my protestations. Experts advised planning for this change two weeks ago by shifting your sleeping schedule a bit each night. That did not happen in my house, where the workdays were long, everyone's calendars were packed and a bad cold threw off our schedule for a week. While the shift technically provided one extra hour of sleep on Sunday, many people didn't feel that benefit. Nighttime light exposure may be linked with top killer disease worldwide So what to do now that we've “fallen back”? What if the darker days ahead start affecting your mood? To help get adjusted, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. CNN: What happens to your body when the clocks change? Dr. Leana Wen: Your internal clock, also called the circadian rhythm, is closely tied to light and darkness. When sunrise and sunset shift suddenly, your body's natural rhythm doesn't immediately keep up. Melatonin, the hormone that helps you feel sleepy, is still being released based on last week's light schedule. That's why you might find yourself wide awake later at night and struggling to get going in the morning. Even a one-hour time change can cause temporary misalignment in your sleep-wake cycle. Your body needs time, consistent routines and light cues to reset. Children and teenagers may take longer to adjust since their circadian rhythms are naturally different from adults'. Teens tend to fall asleep later and wake up later, so early school start times combined with darker mornings can make them especially groggy. CNN: What can we do to get on track faster? Wen: Consistent bedtimes and light exposure in the morning help you adjust faster regardless of your age. Keep your bedtime and wake-up time consistent, even on weekends if possible. These are all part of standard advice for good sleep hygiene, which also includes reducing screen use before bed and creating a regular evening routine, like reading or listening to calming music. A comfortable, cool and dark sleep environment can make a big difference as well since even small amounts of light, noise or discomfort can delay sleep onset. Light is a key regulator of your circadian rhythm, as it suppresses melatonin and helps shift your body clock to the new time. If you wake up before sunrise or work in a dark space, bright indoor lighting or a light therapy lamp used for 20 to 30 minutes in the morning can serve as an effective substitute. These 3 exercises may help with insomnia, new study finds Try to eat breakfast soon after waking, keep mealtimes regular, and avoid heavy meals right before bed. Exercise is another powerful cue for your body clock and an excellent way to improve sleep quality. Morning or afternoon workouts can help you feel more awake and improve your mood. Morning exercise may have the edge since it could also get you outdoors and exposed to natural light. That's fine, though keep in mind that vigorous exercise within a few hours of bedtime can be too stimulating and make it harder to fall asleep. CNN: Does losing daylight affect more than just sleep? The shift to shorter days can negatively affect mood and energy levels, too. According to the US National Institutes of Health, less daylight exposure can slow production of serotonin, which is a brain chemical that supports mood. For some, the change can trigger a more serious condition known as seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. Seasonal affective disorder doesn't mean you have to be SAD. Wen: Consistency and light exposure are key here, too. Avoid introducing new or longer naps; this can make it harder for kids to fall asleep at night and delay their adjustment. Try to get them outside for a few minutes of fresh air and natural light before day care or school. That early light exposure helps reset their internal clock. Gradually shifting bedtime and wake-up time by 10 to 15 minutes over several nights can help smooth the transition and get everyone back on schedule. CNN: When should someone seek help for sleep or mood issues after the time change? Wen: If fatigue, poor sleep or low mood persist for more than two weeks, it's worth checking in with your primary care provider. Chronic sleep loss can affect heart health, immune function and mental well-being. For mood changes, especially feelings of sadness or loss of interest in usual activities, your health care provider can screen for seasonal affective disorder or other causes. Early support makes it easier to recover and may help prevent these patterns from recurring each year. Sign up for CNN's Sleep, But Better newsletter series.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani greets some people in a car while surrounded by reporters in New York, Monday, Oct. 27, 2025. KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — In the Ugandan newsroom where he appeared one day as an intern, Zohran Mamdani looked shy and unassuming. His father had arranged for him to spend time at the Daily Monitor newspaper with hope that the teenager would show more interest in current affairs. Mamdani wanted to be a “top reporter,” which is how Izama recalled saving the young man's number in his cellphone. “He was very, very curious as a young person,” said Izama, who remained in touch with Mamdani for years after his months-long experience as a journalist. “This is something that will stay with him forever.” Now the 34-year-old Mamdani, who has kept his Ugandan citizenship, could become New York City's first Muslim mayor and the first of Indian descent. Tuesday is the final day of voting as he faces Republican Curtis Sliwa and former New York Gov. Izama told The Associated Press he was not surprised by Mamdani's rise in U.S. politics and described him as a role model not just for fellow Ugandans and other Africans but young people everywhere. His father is Mahmood Mamdani, a Columbia professor who taught for many years at Uganda's top public college, Makerere University, and whose academic writings are influential in the field of postcolonial studies. His mother is filmmaker Mira Nair, whose work has been nominated for an Academy Award. The Mamdanis split their time among the U.S., India and Uganda, where they have a hillside home in a wealthy area of Kampala. In July, the family gathered here to celebrate Zohran Mamdani's marriage, underscoring their Ugandan roots. “We shouldn't just be proud of Mamdani,” said Joseph Beyanga, a media manager who is among those who mentored Mamdani at the Daily Monitor. Beyanga said he felt “challenged” by Mamdani's ambition, calling it a civic lesson for young Africans who feel alienated from politics as aging leaders are accused of overstaying their time in power. They include Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who has led the country since 1986. Izama said Mamdani “brings a role-model charge that would electrify Africa, which is full of talent,” adding that “there is reason for us to be very proud.” Mamdani left Uganda as a child but regularly returned. Before he became a New York assemblyman in 2021, the self-described democratic socialist was a community organizer in the New York borough of Queens, helping vulnerable homeowners facing eviction. His campaign has focused on lowering the cost of living, promising free city buses, free childcare, a rent freeze for people living in rent-stabilized apartments and government-run grocery stores, all paid for with taxes on the wealthy. His candidacy has attracted the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who alleged without evidence that Mamdani was in the U.S. “illegally.” Some Republicans have called for Mamdani's denaturalization and deportation. Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama has reportedly offered to be a sounding board for Mamdani, and endorsements have come in from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and New York Gov. You would have to blast your way into the door.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four suspects in custody in relation to their alleged involvement in the spectacular heist at the Louvre museum last month are local petty criminals with no association with organized crime, according to investigators. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the quartet, comprising three men and one woman, were living in or around Seine-Saint-Denis, a suburb to the north of the French capital. One of the men is a 37-year-old with 11 previous convictions, 10 of which were for robbery, Beccuau said in an interview on the FranceInfo radio station Sunday. The man has “a varied criminal record but not one which would normally suggest involvement with organized crime,” she said. One of the men is in a long-term relationship with the 38-year-old woman who has been detained. “They are clearly local people,” said Beccuau. Five further suspects were arrested as part of French authorities investigation into the infamous Louvre heist. Two suspects arrested last week were also placed under formal investigation on Wednesday. French police arrest five further suspects in connection with Louvre heist Asked whether she found the profile of the suspects unusual, Beccuau replied: “I don't find it that surprising. What we are seeing now is that people with no significant association with organized crime are progressing relatively quickly to committing extremely serious crimes.” They broke into two high-security display cases and made off with nine items, including a diamond and sapphire jewelry set worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They have advanced the case to the nation's highest court even as their larger and better-known competitors have remained notably silent. The lack of public input from major US companies on the docket of a Supreme Court appeal with potentially vast consequences for their bottom line and the economy as a whole is unusual and likely based at least in part on a fear of retribution from the White House, multiple people involved with the case and outside experts said. Trump tariffs decision rests on arguments conservatives repeatedly used against Biden “I was shocked that those with much more power and money did not step up,” said Victor Owen Schwartz, the founder of V.O.S. The law lets a president “regulate importation” during emergencies, but does not specifically mention tariffs. Relying on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Trump has rapidly turned some of those tariffs on and off and adjusted rates suddenly to squeeze or ease the pressure during negotiations. Small businesses generally enjoy bipartisan political support and so having lesser-known companies lead the legal charge on tariffs may prove to be a strategic advantage. “It's an asphyxiating tax,” said Rick Woldenberg, the CEO of Learning Resources, which makes educational toys and other products and which is also a lead plaintiff. “I'm a taxpayer who's been hit with an unlawful tax.” And it has warned that a loss would have “catastrophic consequences” for the economy. Even when they are not named plaintiffs, major companies often wade into Supreme Court cases with friend-of-court briefs, offering their own take on the controversy pending before the justices. Three years ago, more than 60 major American firms – including General Electric, Procter & Gamble and Intel – signed a brief urging the justices not to end affirmative action in college admissions, for instance. Today, some of the same companies that signed that brief are facing criticism in the second Trump administration for efforts to expand diversity within their workforces. Walmart jumped into an appeal in 2017 dealing with the credit card industry. Large companies, including many that have been affected by the tariffs, also avoided weighing in on the cases as they moved through lower federal courts. “I think there's a sense that companies wanted to be more careful with this administration.” Friend-of-the-court briefs rarely have sway over the outcome of a case at the Supreme Court, but they can sometimes influence justices in unexpected ways. Last week, an amicus brief from a Georgetown law professor led the court to pause a case involving Trump's use of the National Guard in Illinois and request additional information from both the administration and state officials. Cassie Abel, founder and CEO of a women's outdoor apparel company called Wild Rye, agreed that fear of retaliation was probably part of the reason that larger companies haven't engaged in the tariffs appeal. Abel, who launched her company in Idaho nearly a decade ago, noted that Walmart and other retailers endured public blowback from Trump this year when they threatened tariff-related price increases. “That was a clear signal that anyone who wants to speak out against this is going to be in the pain cave,” said Abel, who joined an amicus brief with other small businesses opposed to the tariffs. Some can switch supply chains or absorb the costs. And, Abel said, some of her largest competitors have pushed back on tariffs – just in quieter ways that don't involve taking a public position in a high-profile case. Several major companies that have submitted briefs in high-profile cases at the Supreme Court in the past – including Apple, Levi Strauss, Walmart and Home Depot – did not respond to requests for comment. Former national security officials, a group representing the watchmaking industry, nearly three dozen former federal judges, a Virginia-based seller of audio equipment and many other small businesses told the justices they're opposed to the import taxes. It's also not clear who is funding the litigation. Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at Liberty Justice Center, a group involved in the case, told CNN that it is funded by “individuals and groups that support our mission” but said it doesn't disclose its donors without their permission. “There are a lot of calculations going on,” said Gregory Husisian, a trade lawyer who represents large importers for the Foley & Lardner law firm. Large companies, he said, have to think about what legal argument they can raise “that's not already before the court.” Without that, he said, “what do you really gain by being the person who sticks your neck out?”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One year out from the midterm elections, the Democratic Party holds a sizable enthusiasm advantage as views of President Donald Trump dip further into negative territory, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. And favorable views of the party still stand near all-time lows as they have throughout this year, 8 points below where they were in the fall of Trump's first year in office. Trump's approval rating in the poll stands at 37%, the worst of his second term in CNN polling and roughly equivalent to his 36% approval rating at this point in his first term. And his disapproval rating, at 63%, is numerically the highest of either term, one point above the previous high of 62% as he was leaving office in January 2021. CNN's Poll of Polls average, which puts Trump's approval rating a few points higher at 41% as of Sunday, charts a similar trend since January. Looking ahead  to next year's midterms, Democrats appear to have a very early advantage: 47% of registered voters say they'd vote for the Democrat in their district if the election were held today, while 42% prefer the Republican. And 41% say they would be sending a message that they oppose Trump with their vote, nearly double the 21% who say their vote would be a message of support for the president. Independents break in Democrats' favor on the generic ballot (44% to 31% for Republicans, with 19% saying they wouldn't pick either right now). Those Democratic-aligned voters who consider the state of democracy to be a top concern are perhaps the most fired up within the party: 82% in that group say they are deeply motivated to vote, compared with 57 % among Democratic-aligned voters who call the economy their top concern. CNN's poll results suggest that the Democratic Party's ongoing internal image troubles may not necessarily translate into defections at the ballot box. Democratic-aligned voters remain far less fond of their own party (65% have a favorable view of the Democratic Party) than Republican-aligned voters (80% have a favorable view of the GOP), but even those Democratic-aligned voters with a negative view of the party are almost universally behind the Democratic candidate in their district (93%) and broadly motivated to vote (71% say they are extremely motivated). All told, Democrats hold a 12-point advantage among those voters who say they are extremely or very motivated to turn out next year. Roughly 8 in 10 consider the federal government shutdown a crisis (31%) or a major problem (50%), and 61% disapprove of Trump's handling of it. Nearly as many disapprove of the way each party's congressional leadership is handling it (58% disapprove of each). A majority hold negative views of Trump's performance on several other key issues: most (56%) feel that his foreign policy decisions have hurt America's standing in the world and 57% say he's gone too far deporting immigrants living in the US illegally. Americans are increasingly likely to say Trump has gone too far in using the power of the presidency – 61% say so, up 9 points since February. On his teardown of the East Wing of the White House, 54% of the public is dissatisfied or angry, with just 10% saying they're satisfied with or happy about that decision. Another 36% (including nearly half of Republicans) say it doesn't matter much to them. Most Americans also see the Republicans who control Congress as doing too much to support Trump (55%, up from 48% who felt that way in February). On the Democratic side, though, views are more divided and party support less clear. Four in 10 say the Democrats in Congress aren't doing enough to oppose Trump, and among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 69% feel that way. The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS online and by phone from October 27 to 30 among a random national sample of 1,245 adults, including 954 registered voters. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points; it is plus or minus 3.6 points for results among registered voters. CNN's Ariel Edwards-Levy and Edward Wu contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Arizona school is embroiled in controversy after a photo of a group of teachers wearing bloody T-shirts went viral on social media over the weekend. Andrew Kolvet, a spokesman for Turning Point USA and executive producer of “The Charlie Kirk Show,” posted about the photo on his X account on Nov. 1, saying the educators deserved to be “famous and fired.” Concerned parents just sent us this image of what's believed to be teachers in @vailschools in Tuscon, Arizona mocking Charlie's murder with costumes that read "Problem Solved" and blood down the left side of their shirts.They deserve to be famous, and fired. “Concerned parents just sent us this image of what's believed to be teachers in @vailschools in Tuscon, Arizona mocking Charlie's murder with costumes that read ‘Problem Solved' and blood down the left side of their shirts,” read Kolvet's post. The school district's superintendent said the shirts were “part of a math-themed Halloween costume meant to represent solving tough math problems” and that the shirts “were never intended to target any person, event, or political issue.” “Unfortunately, the image is being shared online with false claims that they were intended as a statement of recent events in our country,” said Carruth in a statement released to parents in the district. The shirts were purchased online and were also worn last year as part of the same math-themed costumes, long before recent events. “We are truly sorry for the hurt or upset it has caused.” A search for the “Problem Solved” T-shirt revealed that it started being sold long before Kirk's assassination. There was also an Instagram post from a math teacher in October 2024 (seemingly not from the same school district) asking her followers what “math” Halloween costume she should wear, with one of the three options she posted being the “Problem Solved” shirt. Despite this, as of early Monday morning, Kolvet's post had 9.5 million views and over 32,000 likes on X. Rep. Rachel Keshel, a Republican elected official from Arizona's 17th district in the state's House of Representatives, also reposted Kolvet, saying she was “deeply outraged by the recent reports of staff at Vail Unified School District donning costumes that seemingly mock the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk—complete with ‘Problem Solved' slogans and simulated blood stains on the same side that Charlie's fatal wound was on. Conservative activist Riley Gaines promoted the picture as well in a post on X. Ron DeSantis quoted Kolvet's original post on his X account, stating, “It's been really disturbing to see teachers across the country glorifying a murder just because they disagreed with the victim.” Numerous other influencers, commentators, and politicians reposted the story about the Arizona teachers. Some have cast doubt on this explanation but people can read it and decide for themselves. Kolvet posted Carruth's response and explanation later on Nov. 1. “I was waiting for confirmation, and it appears they did. We've seen enough evil since Charlie's murder that I'd actually be relieved if this isn't another example.” Incidentally, Carruth's reply, which was initially posted to the Vail school district's Facebook page, was later removed without explanation. Some have claimed that the post is an example of the dangers of social media, where people do not accurately vet news stories. While Kolvet's original post had over 9.5 million views and 32,000 likes, the updated statement had fewer than 3 million views and over 7,000 likes. There have been reports of other educators mocking Kirk's death, including during the “No Kings” Protest last month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn hosted a phone bank for New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani on Sunday, drawing scrutiny from the Justice Department for potential foreign election interference. “I'm hosting a phone bank with @nycDSA to Get Out The Vote for @ZohranKMamdani today at 6pm ET. Phone-banking is a common campaign tactic where surrogates call voters to ask for their vote. It's unclear if Corbyn is calling voters himself or instructing volunteers on how to make calls. “Foreign interference in a US election?” Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon speculated on X. “I'm sure the John Brennan posse will get right on this with an indignant letter,” Dhillon said in a follow-up post, referencing the former CIA director's Russian interference claim. Stu Smith, an investigative analyst for Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank, says Corbyn's actions could be legal as long as he isn't compensated. Still, it's a perfect example of how DSA, technically a 501(c)(4), keeps blurring lines with its ongoing collaborations and cross border ties to foreign parties. Makes you wonder how closely they're tiptoeing around FARA,” he posted on X. An Equality and Human Rights Commission report in 2020 said the Labour Party was responsible for “unlawful” harassment and discrimination during Corbyn's time as leader. Corbyn has been a supporter of Mamdani, celebrating the New York politician's Democratic primary win in June.</p>
