                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conspiracy theories don't just invent villains; they recycle them. What happens if we hand over the government to the tinfoil hat wearers who have spent centuries thinking the government and its various nefarious plots are behind every evil deed? It doesn't seem to be going too well, but success or failure isn't really the point when it comes to this kind of person. In a new essay in MIT Technology Review, author Dorian Lynskey writes about the United States as a nation that thrives on paranoia and conspiracy, and how technology has only made it easier to get lost in your own little parallel world of unreality. Lynskey writes about a pair of mid-century scholars whose works combined to divide the roadmap for understanding modern conspiracy theory culture. Karl Popper, a Philosopher who defined the idea of a conspiracy theory as we know it today, and Richard Hofstadter, a professor of American history at Columbia University, who gave a lecture on the paranoia inherent in American politics the day before President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, kicking off one of the most enduring conspiracies in American history. Together, they nailed something that still defines our public life: the idea that if we just dig deep enough, we'll find the puppet master pulling every string. Each set of villains provides the same thing: a tidy explanation for why things are a mess, and they give the paranoid someone to blame it all on. Conspiracy theories don't just invent villains; they recycle them. Technology supercharges it all – and not just of the smartphones in our pockets. Lynskey says the printing press fueled witch hunts, and radio helped spread fascist propaganda. All smartphones and the internet have done is turn paranoia into a lifestyle brand. Algorithms run on outrage, and the people on these services demand simple, elegant answers to deeply complex problems, but don't realize that the supposedly simpler and more elegant solutions are much more complicated than anything reality has to offer. People today can fully envelop themselves within conspiracy theories much more easily than people ever could before. You could, in no time at all, almost accidentally curate a social media feed that walls off reality and nestles you within a cozy little cocoon of conspiracy. Hofstadter warned that the paranoid style thrives when people feel powerless. NPR just ran a demoralizing story about how America's youth feel like they have no future, that the American dream is well and truly dead, and no one in charge cares enough to do anything about it. That is probably why we are currently being run by the conspiracy theory administration. In an era where hope is dead, anyone with a social media account can rise up and provide “truths” that easily and conveniently explain who's behind the latest crisis, only for all of that to get tossed out and replaced with a whole new set of villains when the next outrage hits. Lynskey stops short of really digging into why conspiracy theories persist, especially in this day and age when they seem more prevalent and influential than ever. I have my own theory about that. Conspiracy theories used to exist on the political fringes, but now they are the establishment. This is what happens when you create a large-scale societal shift in focus away from those of us who feel powerless and start catering to the powerful. In time, this shift drives a society toward trying to find a collective explanation for why the majority was abandoned. Everyone could potentially be a part of the problem. Sometimes, a large-scale societal shift in focus away from those of us who feel powerless and a catering toward the powerful can, in time, drive a society toward blaming a shadowy network of powerful figures when, really, the problem is just as simple as neglect.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A NASA scientist suggests alien civilizations may exist, but their technology could be far less detectable than we've long assumed. Enrico Fermi's decades-old question—“Where is everybody?”—remains one of science's most haunting mysteries. If the universe is teeming with stars and planets, and life has evolved on Earth, why hasn't it happened elsewhere in a way we can detect? For many researchers, the so-called Fermi Paradox is a puzzle that demands fresh approaches rather than grand assumptions. Paul M. Sutter, astrophysicist and science communicator, digs into this question in a Popular Mechanics feature, drawing heavily from a recent paper by NASA scientist Robin Corbet. Corbet's “A Less Terrifying Universe,” published on the arXiv preprint server, challenges our longstanding ideas of advanced alien civilizations and offers a less dramatic—but more grounded—explanation for the quiet cosmos. From cinematic flying saucers to galaxy-spanning empires, popular culture has created an image of extraterrestrials far beyond what physics or engineering currently allow. According to Popular Mechanics, Hollywood imagines aliens as having flying saucers capable of beaming humans into the sky. This more restrained view of technological progress suggests that alien civilizations might not be broadcasting strong signals, launching visible megastructures, or traversing the galaxy at impossible speeds. Distance remains a primary barrier in any attempt at interstellar communication. While the nearest star system, Proxima Centauri, is just over four light-years away, even that modest stretch poses monumental challenges. Voyager 1, the farthest human-made object, is currently more than 15 billion miles from Earth. Corbet uses this to highlight a simple truth: If our most advanced spacecraft can't span the gap, why should we expect alien vessels to do so either? Once they travel far enough, even Earth's strongest transmissions blend into the general galactic background. As Sutter explains in the same source, “By the time even our most powerful broadcasts… reach Proxima Centauri, they are so weak that they can no longer be distinguished.” Interstellar space is noisy, full of radiation from exploding stars and charged particles. In that context, alien messages—even if they exist—may arrive as nothing more than static. In that context, the presence of even a million colonized systems would be barely noticeable—a statistical rounding error. According to this view, the reason we don't see alien ruins or hear alien voices may be that the universe is too vast and too old, and intelligent life—no matter how advanced—is simply too temporary to leave lasting footprints on a galactic scale.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vice President JD Vance has joined the list of high-ranking government officials wanting answers about UFOs and extraterrestrials. Vance happily declared himself a 'UFO lunatic' and was committed to taking some time during his term in office to examine the evidence he has access to regarding life from other planets. The vice president added that he wasn't the only member of the Trump Administration seeking answers about UFOs, noting that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard want to know as well. We talked about this back in our Senate days. However, the vice president added that what he might view as an angel or demon might be interpreted as an extraterrestrial by others. Vance said he firmly believed that there were phenomena that humans simply can't explain, but was more open to other possibilities, such as a divine presence. The vice president, who was raised an evangelical Christian and converted to Catholicism in 2019, explained that he believed in spiritual forces working in the physical world, which could be mistaken for alien encounters. I don't know the answer to that question,' Vance admitted. Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna has echoed some of the vice president's beliefs, tying biblical events to more recent reports of extraterrestrial sightings. Luna, who serves as the chairwoman for the House Oversight Committee on UFO disclosure, said that many witnesses have described what they saw as 'interdimensional' beings that had similarities to angels in the Bible. 'Then you look into texts that were removed from the Bible, like the book of Enoch, that actually specifically address technologies that were given to mankind or of entities not of human origin,' Luna said on the PBD podcast last week. In August, Gabbard declared on Pod Force One that she did believe in the existence of both UFOs and extraterrestrials, but noted that her role in the intelligence community prevented her from saying anything else. However, Gabbard did add that she still had questions regarding the mysterious UFO swarms that invaded the US East Coast in 2024 and was not convinced they were harmless drones. Despite the growing belief in extraterrestrial life, no verifiable physical evidence, such as artifacts or clear footage of these craft, has been publicly presented to confirm the existence of aliens. Skeptics have argued that the reliance on anecdotal reports from military personnel and civilians and the lack of peer-reviewed scientific data cast significant doubt on the claims made during recent congressional hearings on UAPs. However, a new documentary featuring both Luna and Rubio is set to be released in late November, which alleges that the US government has withheld information regarding UFOs and extraterrestrials from both the public and the White House. 'Even presidents have been operating on a need-to-know basis, but that begins to ramp out of control,' Rubio claimed in the film The Age of Disclosure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Yes, we've been to the Moon before... 6 times!" Nasa acting administrator Sean Duffy wrote on social media. Despite being consistently debunked, conspiracy theories as to whether humans actually reached the Moon have persisted for more than 50 years, particularly with the rise of social media. "I'm sending you a million articles with both Buzz Aldrin and the other one," Kardashian says, before reading a quote allegedly from Aldrin responding to a question about the scariest moment of the expedition. "There was no scary moment because it didn't happen. Kardashian appears to be referring to comments made by Aldrin during a talk in the UK in 2015. During that exchange, Aldrin does not seem to suggest that the expedition did not happen, but instead that a scary moment did not happen. However, he is then prompted to recite an anecdote about a broken circuit breaker. In her conversation with Paulson, Kardashian is later seen telling a producer that she believes the Moon landing was fake. I've seen a few videos on Buzz Aldrin talking about how it didn't happen," she says. "He says it all the time now, in interviews. Aldrin has not yet commented on Kardashian's remarks. Fact-checkers, including at the Reuters news agency, have previously debunked conspiracy theories in which Aldrin's comments have been misinterpreted to suggest he has admitted the landing did not happen. Following the Kardashian broadcast, Duffy tagged the reality star in a post on X, rebuffing her comments, and promoted Nasa's current moon exploration program Artemis, which is "going back under the leadership" of Donald Trump. In response, Kardashian wrote back asking about the interstellar object named 3I/Atlas, which astronomers said could be the oldest comet ever seen. For  decades, scientists and experts have rebutted conspiracy theories claiming the Apollo 11 mission was a hoax. "Every single argument claiming that Nasa faked the Moon landings has been discredited," according to the Institute of Physics. It is hoped the number of employees in Scotland's space industry will rocket to 20,000 in the next 10 years. The rocket launched from Starbase, Texas and flew for more than an hour before splash landing into the Indian Ocean. The Euclid satellite, launched by Space X, was developed by a team including Professor Adam Amara. Astronauts of Nasa's first crewed mission to the Moon for more than 50 years hope their journey inspires a new generation. Read about our approach to external linking.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has sparked controversy after telling television host Bill Maher that unidentified flying objects may actually be 'fallen angels' rather than alien spacecraft. Appearing on the 1 November episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, Greene was asked whether she believed demons exist. When Maher pressed further, asking if she thought aliens might be fallen angels, Greene said: 'That's possible. During the discussion, guest filmmaker Dan Farah referenced claims from senior US military officials who allegedly believe some UFOs may be demonic rather than extraterrestrial. She also addressed her previous Facebook posts linking wildfires and space lasers, claiming she had been unaware at the time that some of the parties mentioned were Jewish. Greene went on to suggest that the government is not being truthful about UFOs. Her remarks contrast sharply with official investigations by NASA and the Pentagon, which have focused on scientific explanations for unidentified aerial phenomena rather than supernatural theories. Nonetheless, Greene's comments highlight a growing intersection of politics, religion and conspiracy, which has increasingly shaped the American debate on UFOs. Critics say Greene's latest remarks fit her broader pattern of provocative and conspiratorial beliefs, from her earlier claims about 'space lasers' to repeated suggestions of government cover-ups. Yet, her willingness to merge theology with extraterrestrial theories has again made her a viral talking point online, especially among audiences sceptical of mainstream science.

Marjorie Taylor Greene tells Bill Maher she believes UFOs could be fallen angels“I think [UAP] is a serious issue.”“People deserve to know the truth.” pic.twitter.com/1xH761Dele Just another ignorant person that has no clue what her own Bible says! Demonic spirits are absolutely obsessed with human suffering and death. News outlets have described Greene's remarks as highly unusual for a sitting member of Congress. Her claims have been met with scepticism from members of the scientific community, who warned against confusing religious belief with unexplained aerial phenomena. Across social media, Greene's comments quickly became a trending topic. Critics condemned what they saw as the blurring of theology and science, while supporters praised her for speaking openly about spiritual realities. The popular tracking app Enigma has recorded more than 30,000 reported sightings since 2022, including thousands of mysterious underwater anomalies off US coastlines. For others, it only intensifies speculation about hidden truths — whether governmental, extraterrestrial or spiritual.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's after sunset and another vehicle flashes its headlights in your direction. This could mean anything from a speed trap nearby, bad road conditions ahead, or even crashed cars on the roadway ahead. Sometimes it can be helpful, other times, downright annoying. While doing a little research on the subject, the answer didn't present itself right away. After diving a little deeper, I found some information on South Dakota's section of the website, trafficschoolonline.com. This website is for anyone who moves to a new state and needs information on its driving laws, as they can differ dramatically depending on what state you live in. According to the site, there is no specific law allowing or prohibiting headlight flashing. While this may seem like a ringing endorsement for headlight flashing, it's more likely a much more vague law in the eyes of law enforcement. If the police believe your headlight flashing is impairing other drivers (or even yourself) from your duties on the roadway, you could still be cited. In Iowa, it appears that there is also no law preventing you from flashing your headlights, but if your flashing is interfering with the work of law enforcement, it could be enough for them to pull you over.</p>
