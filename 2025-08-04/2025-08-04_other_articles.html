                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are no new alerts at this time Comedian Matt Rife said he and YouTuber Elton Castee are now the legal guardians of Annabelle, the doll that famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren said was possessed by an evil spirit. I must go on record and say we do not legally own items, but we are the legal guardians and caretakers of the items for at least the next five years,” Rife said in an Instagram video on Saturday. Rife, 29, announced in an Instagram post on Friday that he and Castee, 35, had purchased the Warrens' home and museum in Monroe, Connecticut, which includes their entire haunted collection of dolls and artifacts. Tony Spera, the Warrens' son-in-law and co-director of the late couple's organization, New England Society for Psychic Research, clarified to TODAY.com that he and his wife still own the Warrens' collection, including the Annabelle doll, and are only leasing them to Rife and Castee. "We have no plans to ever 'sell' the artifacts," he said in a statement. "If you know me, you know I'm obsessed with the paranormal and all things haunted," Rife captioned a photo of himself and Castee posing with the doll. "You also may know The Conjuring films are my favorite scary movies of all time. So I'm incredibly honored to have taken over one of the most prominent properties in paranormal history. Rife said they plan to open the house for "overnight stays and museum tours." His announcement came less than a month after paranormal investigator and Annabelle doll handler Dan Rivera died on the "Devils on the Run Tour," which features the Annabelle doll. Rivera, 54, was found dead in a Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, hotel room on July 13. News, a July 16 police report labeled his death as "natural," but a final cause of death won't be determined until an autopsy is completed. The New England Society for Psychic Research did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.</p>

Still, she is also open to trying other psychic sites like Keen and Purple Garden. While it doesn't have nearly as many psychics as Keen, it carefully screens all its advisors, accepting only the top 2%. Known for a wide variety of readings and a free articles section on everything psychic and spiritual, Psychic Source is another viable alternative to Keen. Psychic Source features multiple $1 per minute introductory offers for 10, 20, or 30 minutes. As for the regular rates, these start at just $0.99 per minute. As Redditor asmw9 said in r/psychics, Psychic Source is one of the few online psychic sites they recommend checking out, although they were initially skeptical at first.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The unassuming town of Carnation, Washington, is gearing up to host Modest Mouse‘s inaugural Psychic Salamander Festival this September 13 and 14. Home to just 2,279 people, the small town farm venue promises an intimate festival feel, a bit of an oxymoron when considering the usual music festival formula. Psychic Salamander Fest will take place four months before Modest Mouse and friends set sail on their Ice Cream Floats cruise tour. Hosted by Modest Mouse, of course, the lineup also includes The Flaming Lips and Built To Spill on Saturday, September 13. Additional acts include Courtney Barnett, The Vaudevillian, and Mattress. Psychic Salamander Festival will take place at Remlinger Farms in Carnation, Washington. Remlinger Farms is a working farm and amusement park in the small town, specializing in local produce, corn mazes, U-Pick fields, and other outdoor entertainment. Remlinger Farms has evolved since its inception in 1965, adding a market, theater, and a petting zoo, along with the Tolt River Railroad Steam Train Ride. According to the festival website, parking is free with a ticket purchase, while children under 12 can attend for free. Additionally, concert-goers can come and go as they please during the festival weekend with the relaxed re-entry policies. Tickets are available now on the official Psychic Salamander Festival website. Interested fans can also learn more about the venue, accommodations, food and drink options, and general policies for the festival.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beckie-Ann Galentine's guests knew to expect a 'weird' baby shower, but they didn't know how many paranormal twists she had planned In a video posted to TikTok on July 9, Beckie-Ann Galentine documented what she called "the spookiest baby shower ever," an event that included paranormal-themed activities and seances. A lover of all things spooky, Galentine knew she'd want to plan her own event catered to her particular tastes. So I planned it and what was really nice is a lot of people have already done stuff for the baby, as far as necessities," she tells PEOPLE about hosting the event. "This got to be an open invitation for my community to come together and celebrate a new baby being brought into it, so it's obviously something that's very special," she continues. Admittedly, a paranormal theme isn't what comes to mind for most when it comes to a baby shower, but Galentine says the idea was very aligned with her lifestyle. "My day-to-day life is very engulfed in the paranormal and everything, so I saw it — and not everyone saw it this way — but I saw it as a way to connect with ancestors and people who came before us," she explains. It was rooted in spirit communication and history," she continues. When it came to planning, Galentine had a vision for the perfect venue. "I had known that I wanted a haunted venue because people are going to be traveling and there was already going to be a baby shower, so I wanted a place that people could stay afterwards, and we could all kind of enjoy each other afterwards," she says of choosing the Shanley Hotel in Napanoch, N.Y., where she and guests had the opportunity to ghost hunting after the party was through. Ultimately, we decided on that because some of the other hotels, they don't really have like space to explore, and this one has every floor with a different vibe and has something else going on." How is this going to fall into place?" Activities included guessing how many candies were an ectoplasm jar, a trivia game about famous locations that are haunted by children and some on-sight ghost hunting as well as a scavenger hunt. There was a key for that, so all of the items were tagged an hidden," she says of the latter. Before the shower itself was over, guests enjoyed a beautiful custom cake from Vegan Treats in Bethlehem, Pa. "One of the obvious show-stopping things from the event was the cake," she says, explaining that she told the dessert vendor she wanted "something that kind of reminds me of a Ouija board [and] that I wanted to be in this muted lavender Victorian color that matches everything." "I had literally a pencil sketch of what the cake was going to look like, and everyone was just like shocked when that came out. The cake obviously grabbed a lot of attention," she continues. "I say morgue, but what it was used for is a receiving vault," she says of the space. Galentine says, "We saw that space and then we were able to do the Ouija seance, which someone had as a prize from one of the games. I collected antique talking boards and have a collection that's been featured on the news. I have probably a hundred of them in my house, so choosing them as the prize was kind of like a way of sharing something I love with the people who were there, because not a lot of people know where to find the antique Ouija boards." She event kept the theme for her registry as she prepares for the arrival of her baby boy, who will be named Ezra. "There's a lot more other people who paved the way for moms to have choices when it comes to clothes and toys, and things like that. My registry had a lot of things from those smaller brands, and it was really nice, too, because when I picked things on my registry, I was looking at small artists on Etsy and things that were hand designed and handmade," the expecting mom says. Galentine adds, "A lot of people made things for him as well. There's always going to be more baby products that you can buy at any store, but I like that I have things that in 20 years, I can say, 'Hey, this person made this for you to kind of welcome you here.' The unusual theme may have raised some eyebrows when Galentine shared it online, but she's grateful for every moment. The invitation said, 'A shower and seance welcoming Ezra Oliver.' The people who wanted to be there understood that this was not going to be traditional, but I don't know if they expected it to be all that it was. In the end, Galentine was most grateful to see the outpouring of community she and baby Ezra are being met with. I realized how much we look out for each other and how much space there is to do that," she shares. "I thought maybe a few people would show up and that's it, and I was okay with that. Nobody who was there is ever going to forget going to that baby shower, it's it, and they've said that," Galentine says. "Even afterwards, I'm still seeing people who want to interact and support each other. So, it was like, you know, all the people who were there kind of bonded, and it created an even stronger moment."</p>

      I just interviewed Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb, known for his work on ʻOumuamua and now the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS.
    


      We went deep into whether 3I/ATLAS could be alien technology, why it defies conventional explanation, and what it would take to actually find out.
    


Highlights:



      Loeb explains the key anomalies that make 3I/ATLAS not your average comet



      He outlines a real mission concept using NASA's Juno spacecraft to intercept the object in 2025
    


      Reveals that Congresswoman Paulina Luna has formally requested NASA pursue the mission—guided by Loeb's proposal



      And—this part surprised me—he had never even heard of Project Blue Beam before I brought it up
    


      I asked him point-blank if he thought this was part of a fake alien invasion narrative, and his answer was refreshingly blunt.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rupert Matthews has written books about ghost sightings, cryptozoology and other paranormal subjects At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Reform UK has been mocked after announcing their latest defection to the party – a police and crime commissioner who is an expert on ghosts, aliens and UFOs. Before being elected in 2021, he served two years as a European parliament member for the Tories. He has also written a number of books about ghost sightings, UFOs, cryptozoology and other paranormal subjects. It's no surprise he's added Reform's fiscal plans to that list.” Their latest recruit Rupert Matthews peddles alien conspiracy theories and believes the removal of abortion rights overseas is a ‘triumph' for democracy.” During a press conference at the party's London HQ on Monday, unveiling the move, Mr Matthews took aim at the criminal justice system, saying the “dark heart of wokeness” needed to be removed, as well as accusing politicians in Britain of taking inspiration from “failed states” for their policies. “It's almost as if they've looked at countries like Lebanon and Libya, the policies that have led to them becoming failed states and thought, ‘that looks good, let's try that here in Britain'”, he said. Be they Conservative or Labour governments, everyone knows our politicians have failed us all. He also said police officers were all too often working with “one hand tied behind their back”. I see ordinary, hard-working people burgled, robbed and mugged. Reform also announced that a retired prison governor of Wormwood Scrubs, Vanessa Frake-Harris, had joined the party and would be contributing to its law and order task force. She said: “Successive governments, Conservative and Labour, have driven the prison service to its knees through lack of investment, support and an unwillingness to allow people who know what they are doing to get the job done.” She continued: “Our prisons are in a crisis caused by Labour and the Conservatives. To let criminals out of jail before they even serve their full sentence is a disgrace.” A Labour spokesperson said: “It's farcical that Farage can't say what his policies are, how much they would cost, or how they would even work. Reform aren't serious and don't have a clue as to how they would address the challenges facing working people.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jason Epstein travels internationally as a public affairs consultant, and although he is a proud Jew, he does not announce it in countries where that might be an issue. Until now it hasn't been a problem, he says: Last names immediately recognizable as Jewish in the West are not identified as such in much of the rest of the world. Lately, though, his Jewishness is coming up, he says, and he suspects it's because antisemitic conspiracy theories have resurged alongside renewed attention to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender at the center of one the United States' strangest and most divisive political issues. “You do have to wonder whether your last name might be the same as wearing a kippah,” he said. Just as kippah-wearing Jews have experienced attacks from both right-wing and left-wing antisemites, so too are extremists on both the left and the right spreading antisemitic conspiracy theories about Epstein, a spokesperson for the Anti-Defamation League told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, who noted that Epstein's crimes and alleged crimes had nothing to do with his Jewish identity. “The ADL Center on Extremism has tracked a demonstrable increase in rhetoric that promotes antisemitic and anti-Israel conspiracy theories about Jeffrey Epstein in recent weeks, many of which attribute Epstein's deplorable crimes to a supposed covert Israeli operation run by Mossad,” the spokesperson said. Five years after he was found hanged in his prison cell, Epstein is in the headlines because the Trump administration has flip-flopped on meeting a key demand of President Donald Trump's MAGA base, to release all the files in a bid to expose whomever else joined Epstein in his criminal activity. Trump has urged his followers to leave the case alone, calling it a conspiracy theory concocted by Democrats. “It's just a red line that it crosses for many people,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican long known for her fealty to Trump, told CNN last month. “It has been a very serious situation for the administration.” “This rhetoric has surged in recent weeks across the political spectrum, on both fringe and mainstream social media, streaming platforms and shows,” the spokesperson said. “Whenever you have this notion of collectivizing all Jews as this global nefarious force, that's the most dangerous thing,” Shanes said. Ari Ben Menashe, a onetime Israeli operative whom Israeli and American officials have said is a fabulist who vastly exaggerates and fabricates, claims to have run Epstein as an asset. There is otherwise no substantial evidence of any ties between Epstein and Israeli intelligence. Allegations that Epstein has ties to the Mossad have circulated for years based on an array of disparate connections: The fact that he was Jewish, his longtime financial relationship and friendship with Les Wexner, the fashion magnate known for his Jewish philanthropy, his visits to Israel among many other countries, his friendship with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, one of many notable figures in the United States, Britain and elsewhere who hobnobbed with Epstein when he was an investor and a philanthropist. The conspiracists also make an issue of Epstein's sex trafficking coconspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving time in a federal position, being the daughter of Robert Maxwell, the scandal-plagued Jewish British media magnate who ran guns to Israel during its independence war. “There are those on the far right, like Tucker Carlson and others who are using this to advance antisemitic and other extremist conspiracy theories related to Mossad, related to broader issues,” she said. “And there are those on the far left who are eager to jump on them because it validates their own worldview. And so understanding the ways in which this looks like a horseshoe right now is important.” The conspiracy theories have gotten widespread airplay in recent weeks. Carlson's conspiracy mongering drew a rebuke from Naftali Bennett, the former Israeli prime minister. Carlson, who has platformed antisemites on his programming, is known to be a critic of the U.S.-Israel relationship. His former colleague at Fox News, Megyn Kelly, who like Carlson has a massive online following, is known for her pro-Israel sympathies – but she too has flirted the Mossad conspiracy theory. “Where'd he get all that money?” Kelly said after airing Carlson's claims Epstein was employed by the Mossad, in a contentious interview last month on her online show with the Jewish online media magnate, Ben Shapiro, who was on the show to debate Kelly on whether the current Epstein scandal merited the attention it was receiving. “Israel really wants to steer clear of pissing off the United States,” he said. “So this is a world of people who overlap with Israeli intelligence, and maybe Epstein is useful as a conduit of information,” he said. On X, Greene used a term often associated with Jewish nefariousness, “elite evil cabals,” in calling for the release of the Epstein files. Top congressional Democrats are leading the charge for the files' release, seeing an opening to wound Trump early in his second term. Shanes, the professor of Jewish history, said the pursuit was legitimate, but lawmakers should take care to vociferously denounce conspiracy-mongering. “If someone is getting out there and in the news cycle and saying, ‘Show us the file, Epstein, Epstein, Epstein,' they should be very careful at any opportunity that they see a hint of conspiracy thinking about Jews or Israel to clarify, ‘well, that's ridiculous. Spitalnick said journalists, academics, politicians and other public figures should in every instance of mentioning the Epstein case emphasize that the Israel- and Jewish-related conspiracy theories are baseless. The ADL official agreed, saying that it was especially critical to rebuff antisemitic conspiracies as their penetration has metastasized since Hamas launched a war on Israel. “We've observed and tracked an explosion of antisemitic rhetoric in the nearly two years since Oct. 7, 2023, including a considerable number of conspiracy theories and rampant online hate and harassment against Jews.” the spokesperson said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study reveals that cosmic rays could be the key to supporting alien life on icy moons like Europa and Enceladus. These rays, originating from supernovae and other cosmic phenomena, have enough energy to strip electrons from atoms and molecules, a process that can damage biological structures. On Earth, our atmosphere and magnetic field shield us from this radiation. However, the study suggests that on distant moons, cosmic rays might play a crucial role in supporting alien life. The process that makes this possible is called radiolysis, where high-energy cosmic rays interact with water or ice molecules, breaking them apart and releasing energy. This energy could theoretically support microbial metabolism, enabling life to survive in environments devoid of sunlight and warmth. Traditionally, scientists have focused the search for alien life on planets with Earth-like conditions, including liquid water and a moderate climate. However, this new study suggests that life could potentially thrive in cold, dark environments as long as there is subsurface water and a source of cosmic radiation. Beneath its icy surface lies a vast ocean, and cosmic rays could provide the energy necessary for microbial life to flourish in this otherwise inhospitable environment. Similarly, Enceladus, Saturn's moon, also has subsurface oceans, which could interact with cosmic rays to provide the conditions needed for alien life. These findings suggest that alien organisms could survive in places that were once considered too extreme for life to exist, vastly expanding the scope of where life might be found in our solar system and beyond. “This discovery changes the way we think about where life might exist,” says Dimitra Atri, an astrobiologist at New York University's Abu Dhabi campus. Instead of focusing solely on warm planets bathed in sunlight, the study encourages the exploration of cold and dark worlds where subsurface water and cosmic radiation might create habitable conditions for life. Atri notes, “Life might be able to survive in more places than we ever imagined.” This new perspective on cosmic rays as a source of energy for microbial metabolism suggests that the possibilities for life beyond Earth are far more expansive than we once thought. The subterranean oceans of these moons, shielded by thick ice crusts, may allow for the perfect conditions where cosmic rays can support microbial organisms.

They were last seen at Behr's Market, now Downtown Liquor and Market, where they bought soda and candy for the drive home to Marysville. Four days later, their car was discovered abandoned on a dirt logging road northeast of Oroville near Rogers Cow Camp. More than three months later, one man's body was found in a forest service trailer at Daniel Zink Campground, 20 miles northeast of the car. The case has inspired books and documentaries due to its puzzling nature. Questions linger about why the men drove up a snowy mountain road and left their car in winter. Mathias, diagnosed with schizophrenia and known to have drug problems, left behind curious clues. His black shoes were found in the trailer where Ted Weiher's body was discovered.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WNKY) — Bigfoot believers, ghost hunters, and cryptid enthusiasts gathered in Bowling Green on Saturday for the second annual Bigfoot MiniCon. The event brought together paranormal fans from across the region, featuring panelists, investigators, and former television personalities sharing stories and theories about the unknown. “This is the Bigfoot MiniCon, and it's a great opportunity to bring a bunch of people together that have a similar interest in strange and supernatural type… I guess sightings,” said Dave Schrader, host of the Paranormal 60 radio show. It marked Schrader's first time attending the event in Bowling Green. “I was drawn here because my friends, people from the shows Mountain Monsters and Expedition Bigfoot, really love this area,” he said. “Since I've been here, I can admit to that — everybody we've had a chance to meet have been absolutely fantastic and so welcoming.” People have been very pleasant,” one of the team members said. The group emphasized that even seasoned investigators come to events like this to learn something new. “Any time we get to be around other enthusiasts — if you're not learning, then you're not listening,” they said. Organizers say they hope to bring the event back for a third year in 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last month, Harvard University researchers Avi Loeb, Adam Hibberd and Adam Crowl published a paper which suggested that comet 3l/ATLAS could be a reconnaissance probe sent by a technologically advanced alien civilisation watching our planet. It's worth noting that the researchers, as well as NASA scientists, have since stressed the most likely scenario is that 3l/ATLAS is just a comet. But should the 'most likely outcome' of 3l/ATLAS not being a 'completely natural interstellar' object turn out to be false, then late physicist Stephen Hawking has a sobering warning to remind us why we shouldn't rush to welcome alien arrivals to Earth. Prior to his death in 2018, Hawking had stressed numerous times about the dangers of reaching out to more technologically advanced civilisations, as they may not have peaceful or benevolent intentions. "If aliens ever visit us," Hawking explained in an episode of Into the Universe back in 2010, "[Then] outcome might be similar to when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans. The Cambridge researcher believed that an advanced alien civilisation capable of cruising through the cosmos would've likely have exhausted the materials on their own planet, and be on the lookout for other plants to colonise for resources or move to. This wasn't the only time which Hawking warned against reaching out to alien civilisations, with the 76-year-old drawing a line between establishing that other planetary civilisations exist and offering an olive branch. Hawking's warnings relate to a theory known as the 'Dark forest hypothesis'. Which means if aliens are out there and beginning to make themselves known, we shouldn't be welcoming them to Earth with open arms, unless we want to live out a War of the Worlds type scenario.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 30 years after the first reports emerged, the mystery surrounding a small village in central Scotland remains as baffling as ever. Bonnybridge, near Falkirk, shot to global attention in the 1990s after a wave of sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), or what are now officially referred to as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs). Since then, more than 300 reports of unexplained activity have been recorded, making it one of the UK's most active areas for supposed other-worldly encounters. At its height, the story drew international media coverage, sparking theories of conspiracies, government cover-ups and even the possibility of a portal to another dimension. One of the earliest and most significant sightings occurred in January 1992. Local businessman James Walker was driving along a country road towards Droves Loan when he claimed to see something he could not explain. Malcolm Robinson, one of the UK's leading UFO and paranormal researchers, recalled: “He claimed that he saw a large triangular-shaped craft low down in the sky, which had small lights on its underside. He founded Strange Phenomena Investigations in 1979, Scotland's longest-running UFO research group, and has written extensively on unexplained sightings. At the time of the Bonnybridge sightings, local councillor Billy Buchanan took it upon himself to gather accounts from residents. By the end of 1992, he had documented over 200 separate incidents involving unusual lights, shapes and aerial objects. Despite repeated attempts by Buchanan to raise the issue at the highest levels of government, his calls for an official investigation were consistently ignored. He wrote to several ministers and even Prime Ministers, including Tony Blair in 1997, but received no formal response. “It is important to say that the term UFO means Unidentified Flying Object. It does not describe alien ships visiting the earth,” Robinson added. The growing number of reports soon drew widespread media attention. Local and national newspapers were quick to seize on the story, and television crews descended on the village. A public meeting was held in January 1993, as concerned locals sought answers. That November, broadcasters filmed a UFO watch event in Bonnybridge. By the mid-1990s, sightings from the area had featured in countless newspaper articles and were even explored on national television.

However, as the years went on, the wave of sightings gave way to scepticism, with critics accusing witnesses of seeking publicity or fabricating stories. Some national tabloids even ran claims of alien contact with villagers. Still, for many residents and researchers, the questions remain unanswered. And for some, it remains a mystery worth revisiting. Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before his death, Stephen Hawking consistently warned humanity against contacting aliens. As interest in UFOs and little green men comes to the fore, an ominous warning he made has also resurfaced. What did Stephen Hawking say about aliens? Stephen Hawking, the renowned physicist known for his contributions to humanity's understanding of black holes, the cosmos, and the nature of the universe, once warned that if aliens make contact with us, they won't be kind and might view Earth as just another planet to plunder. The world-renowned scientist's warning has once again entered the spotlight as intrigue around UFOs and extraterrestrial life continues to escalate. This is amplified by reports of a possible alien warship that may strike around November and as US Vice President JD Vance revealed his "obsession" with the little green men. He said recently while appearing on the Ruthless podcast. What did Stephen Hawking say about aliens? He warned that an intellectually superior species may view our planet as a world ready to plunder instead of approaching us with goodwill. In an ominous warning, he suggested that such contact may even jeopardise humanity's survival. Pointing at how historically dominant societies, when they encounter less developed cultures, tend to dominate and disregard suffering that isn't their own, he argued that humans only need to look at themselves "to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet". According to Hawking, it would be stupid to presume that a sophisticated civilisation would inherently embrace peace. Stephen Hawking further theorised that a developed alien species that possesses advanced interstellar travel capabilities would probably (like humans are currently doing) have depleted their natural resources. In such a case, Earth could look less like an ally and more like a viable conquest. Notably, Hawking was not alone in warning about how dangerous contact with aliens could be. Carl Sagan, an American astronomer and planetary scientist who dedicated his life to research on his research on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, is also known to have voiced a need for caution. He pointed out that alien psychology could be beyond our predictions. However, some scientists argue that humanity has been beaming radio waves and signals into space for over a century. They posit that intelligent alien species may already know we exist, and if Hawking's warning was in fact a premonition, then we may already be doomed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whilst worldwide intrigue surrounding UFOs and extraterrestrial life continues to escalate, renowned physicist Stephen Hawking consistently advocated for restraint, contending that mankind's enthusiasm to establish contact with alien civilisations could prove catastrophic. During the period before his passing in 2018, Hawking persistently cautioned that any intentional effort to communicate with extraterrestrial beings, particularly those potentially far superior to our own species, might jeopardise humanity's survival. His concern centred on the possibility that rather than approaching us with inquisitiveness or goodwill, a supremely intelligent alien race might view Earth as a world ready for plunder. "If aliens ever visit us," Hawking said in a 2010 episode of Into the Universe, "the outcome might be similar to when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans." If anything, humanity's historical patterns, particularly when dominant societies encounter less developed cultures, indicate that domination, settlement, or disregard for suffering are equally probable as negotiation. Hawking theorised that alien societies with interstellar travel capabilities would probably have depleted their homeworld's natural resources, driving them to traverse the cosmos seeking fresh planets to colonise or mine for raw materials. Under these circumstances, Earth might be perceived as a viable conquest rather than an ally. Despite championing the hunt for intelligent life beyond our planet, Hawking drew a firm distinction between listening and making contact. Whilst initiatives like Breakthrough Listen, which earned Hawking's backing, focus on picking up alien transmissions, other programmes including Breakthrough Message and METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence) advocate actively broadcasting messages into the cosmos to announce our existence to other civilisations. This warning has resurfaced lately following heightened public and governmental focus on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs, the military designation for UFOs). American authorities have released classified military footage of mysterious airborne objects, whilst parliamentary sessions have spotlighted whistleblower allegations regarding possible non-human intelligence. Although numerous researchers continue to doubt these encounters involve extraterrestrial visitors, public fascination has been rekindled, alongside fresh interest in Hawking's viewpoint. Even if intelligent aliens are aware of our planet, making ourselves known could provoke a response, positive or negative, that we're ill-equipped to manage. Notable figures such as physicist Michio Kaku and SETI pioneer Frank Drake have voiced their ambivalence towards interstellar communication. Despite these cautionary words, some scientists argue that maintaining silence is neither practical nor beneficial. Given that Earth has been emitting radio waves into space for over a century, technologically advanced civilisations may already be aware of our existence. From this perspective, intentional messaging might not make much of a difference.</p>
