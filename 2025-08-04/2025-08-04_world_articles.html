Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! Ariel was built on land stolen from the Palestinian towns of Salfit, Marda, and Iskaka after Israeli forces conquered the West Bank in a 1967 war waged on false pretense of an imminent threat of Egyptian and Syrian attack. Settlers, often protected and sometimes joined by Israeli troops, have launched numerous deadly pogroms and other attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank in what critics say is a bid to finish what Israel started in 1948 — the total conquest of Palestine, the ethnic cleansing of its Arab population, and Israeli annexation. Johnson, who is reportedly the highest-ranking American official to visit an Israeli settlement, was accompanied by U.S. Following U.S President Donald Trump's reelection last November, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a member of the far-right Religious Zionist party, said that “the year 2025 will be, with God's help, the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria.” The Israeli government has repeatedly approved construction and expansion of settlements in a bid to establish irreversible “facts on the ground” that will survive developments in international law and moves by an increasing number of nations to formally recognize Palestinian statehood. Recently, France became the first Group of Seven member to announce it will officially recognize Palestine. Last week, Canada said it would also do so, with conditions attached, and the United Kingdom threatened recognition of Palestine if Israel does not take “substantive steps” to end its annihilation of Gaza, where Israeli forces have killed or wounded more than 200,000 people since October 2023. Last year, the International Court of Justice — which is also weighing a Gaza genocide case against Israel — found that the occupation is an illegal form of apartheid that must end as soon as possible. Last week, one of those settlers, Yinon Levy, allegedly murdered Palestinian peace activist Awda Hathaleen in Umm al-Kheir after the latter was denied entry into the United States to take part in an interfaith speaking tour. While Israel grants every Jew in the world the right to settle in Israel, it has refused to allow the approximately five million Palestinian refugees — people ethnically cleansed from Palestine during the foundation of Israel in 1948 and their descendants — to exercise their legal right of return to their homeland. The Republicans' visit to the West Bank followed last week's tour by Huckabee and Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff of a Gaza aid distribution center run by a U.S.-backed group condemned for its role in Israeli forces' massacres of desperate people seeking food and other lifesaving aid — a visit denounced by one critic as a “blatant theatrical display.” As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Minister Mark Carney, left, meets with U.S. President Donald Trump, right, in the Oval Office at the White House on May 6. The U.S. has imposed a 35-per-cent tariff on Canadian goods that are not USMCA-compliant.Leah Millis/Reuters Where do things stand for Canada after the United States imposed a new, higher tariff last Thursday evening? In the short run, not much has changed. In the long run, a lot may yet change. Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. is reversing course, hard and fast. The average American tariff on imports from all countries was 17.3 per cent on Aug. 1, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. That's more than seven times higher – yes, you read that right – than at the start of the year. The last time U.S. taxes on imports were this high was 1934. It's true that the President has consistently done less than threatened. But extreme threats have conditioned both U.S. public opinion and foreign governments to accept the previously unimaginable. Last month, the European Union, Japan and South Korea all agreed to the U.S. slapping a 15-per-cent tariff on most of their exports. Ok, I shall be generous, and just cut your thumb. Only two countries have retaliated: China and Canada. That's the context in which Canada is trying to negotiate with Washington. In accepting a 15-per-cent U.S. tariff, Japan, South Korea and the EU all effectively agreed to this. What ultimate level of import duties Mr. Trump hopes to impose on Canada, covering what basket of goods, remains unclear. However, Mr. Carney has signalled that any deal with the U.S. could include a baseline tariff, as Japan, South Korea and the EU agreed to. He also implied that Canada might have to offer commitments to buy U.S. goods or make investments in the U.S., as those other trading partners did, though the terms of their promises are vague and possibly meaningless. LeBlanc says Trump, Carney to speak in coming days following tariff announcement The 35-per-cent tariff that Mr. Trump slapped on Canada on Thursday night – up from the 25-per-cent rate imposed earlier this year – only applies to goods that are not USMCA-compliant. The whopping 35-per-cent tariff only applies to less than 5 per cent of our exports. These hit hard because Canada is a major exporter of these goods, and our auto industry is fully integrated with U.S. supply chains. To the extent that Canadian-made vehicles use American parts, they receive a reduction in the auto duty, but steel, aluminum and lumber get no such break. Other U.S. trading partners, with the exception of Mexico, have no USMCA protections. Last Friday, Canada-U.S. Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc said talks will continue with the Americans, but that he was leaving Washington after a long period of intense negotiations, and that no progress was likely in the coming days. Canada has breathing room because of the USMCA, and so does Mexico. It got a 90-day extension on negotiations, with no new tariffs, on the same day as Canada was hit with the 35-per-cent levy. Negative economic news – a small helping of which arrived last week – could lead the American public and business to push back more forcefully against Mr. Trump's tariff plans. Mr. Trump could also walk away with six months notice. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following. © Copyright 2025 The Globe and Mail Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since President Donald Trump took office, federal agents have detained and attempted to deport DACA recipients. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. Despite previous statements indicating that the president wanted to protect Dreamers, the Trump administration is now calling DACA recipients “illegal aliens” and encouraging them to self-deport. DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, is a program that began under President Barack Obama which allows people who came to the United States as children no later than June 15, 2007, and meet other requirements, to live and work in the United States. The program provides them with no pathway to citizenship. There are more than half a million DACA recipients living in the United States. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. Illegal aliens who claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportations,” Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Truthout in a statement. “DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country. She continued: “Illegal aliens can take control of their departure with the CBP Home App. The United States is offering illegal aliens $1,000 and a free flight to self-deport now. McLaughlin has provided other news outlets with identical statements. The administration's statement conflicts with what President Donald Trump said in December, shortly after his election. In June, Health and Human Services announced that DACA recipients were no longer considered “lawfully present” and, effective August 25, were barred from participating in the health care marketplace established by the Affordable Care Act. Since Trump took office, federal agents have detained and attempted to deport DACA recipients. On June 12, masked federal officers abducted Javier Diaz Santana, a DACA recipient who is deaf and mute, from his workplace in Temple City, California. He asked them to remove the handcuffs so he could sign, but they refused and denied his request for a sign language interpreter. “I have DACA,” he told the local news outlet. Congress' failure to codify protections for DACA recipients have left them vulnerable to the Trump administration's racist mass deportation agenda — the majority of recipients were born in Mexico — as well as ongoing legal challenges. Despite its widespread popular support, Congress has not passed the DREAM Act, first introduced more than two decades ago, which would allow Dreamers to attain lawful permanent residency if they meet certain criteria. In July, Sen. Alex Padilla (D-California) introduced legislation that would update the Registry provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which was enacted in 1929, to allow people who have lived in the United States for at least seven years and have no criminal record to apply for a green card, which would provide them lawful permanent status. Currently, the Registry only provides a pathway to citizenship for people who have lived in the United States since January 1, 1972 and meet other criteria. Padilla says that Republicans have voiced support for protecting Dreamers in private, and he's urging them to take a public stand. In June, Padilla was forced to the ground and handcuffed after he attempted to question DHS Secretary Kristi Noem about the Trump administration's immigration policies. A recipient of AIPAC donations, Padilla voted against Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vermont) resolution to stop arms sales to Israel, despite the growing consensus that the country is committing genocide.) “Now, this story doesn't end the way you think it might, because we will continue fighting, not just to stop these outrageous arrests, but we will not rest until we enact real and permanent protections for DACA recipients who contribute so much to our country.” As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A third person has been arrested on suspicion of helping a fugitive accused of killing four relatives of a Tennessee baby who was found abandoned alive last week, authorities said Monday. Meanwhile, authorities were scouring a wooded area near a private university in Jackson, Tennessee, on Monday afternoon as part of the investigation into the suspect in the killings, 28-year-old Austin Robert Drummond, a law enforcement source familiar said. Sanders will be booked into the Lake County Jail, the TBI said, and it is unclear if she has obtained an attorney. The same charges were also filed last week against Tanaka Brown and Giovonti Thomas, both 29. Authorities have not specified precisely what the three are accused of doing to help Drummond. Drummond remains on the lam, but authorities investigating the case were searching a wooded area Monday near Union University in Jackson – the same western Tennessee city where authorities say a vehicle associated with him was found unoccupied last week. At the request of police, the university locked exterior doors to all buildings, university spokesperson Tim Ellsworth said Monday afternoon. Because the school year starts Thursday, teachers, but not students, were at the school, which covers pre-K through grade 12. Drummond is sought in connection with the deaths of James M. Wilson, 21; Adrianna Williams, 20; Cortney Rose, 38; and Braydon Williams, 15, whose bodies were found July 29 in Tiptonville, a town in northwest Tennessee's Lake County, the TBI said. The four were found dead hours after the baby daughter of Wilson and Adrianna Williams was found abandoned on the afternoon of July 29 in a car seat in a “random” front yard near the Dyer County community of Tigrett, nearly a 40-mile drive southeast of Tiptonville, authorities had said. Jackson is about 45 miles southeast of Tigrett. The TBI hasn't said what led it to name Drummond as a suspect, or whether investigators know of a motive in the killings or why the baby was abandoned a county away from where the bodies were found. Rose was the baby's maternal grandmother, and Braydon Williams was the baby's maternal uncle, according to Danny Goodman, district attorney for Dyer and Lake counties. “The victims were all from Dyer County, and we suspect the person that killed them knew all of them,” Goodman, who also confirmed Wilson and Adrianna Williams were the baby's parents, told CNN last week. This is a developing story and will be updated. CNN's Cindy Von Quednow and Lily Hautau contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration made interviewing Jeffrey Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, a key part of its efforts to climb out from beneath its Epstein files problems. Over a week later, we still don't know what transpired during that meeting. But the Maxwell situation has only grown to epitomize a series of very curious maneuvers that call into question precisely what everyone in the administration is thinking and suggest the controversy is going nowhere fast. Indeed, it's almost as if those involved are trying to make this look bad. But it's conspicuous for a host of reasons. There is plenty we don't know about all of this, in large part because the key players aren't talking. It's theoretically possible this is all just a major coincidence. Now we learn she got a highly unusual perk. And it's merely the latest in a series of very questionable developments. But its own filing last week reinforced that information is likely to be quite limited, if it even sees the light of day. Last week, after days of confusion, the president ultimately said he had been aware in real time that Epstein “stole” one of his Mar-a-Lago employees, a then-minor named Virginia Giuffre who became one of Epstein's highest-profile accusers. Given Giuffre's age at the time and a paper trail that suggests Trump's awareness of Epstein's affinity for young women and girls, that raises valid questions about what Trump knew or might have suspected at the time. Family members of Giuffre's have raised the possibility that Trump knows more than he has let on, but the president has balked at expanding on his statements about why this episode made him decide Epstein was a “creep.” Trump, who has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, claimed Thursday that “I don't know really why” Epstein was taking his employees. But he's repeatedly made false and misleading claims about his past ties to Epstein. Most recently, he denied that Attorney General Pam Bondi had told him his name was in the Epstein files, which CNN later reported she had – back in May. And then there is the Maxwell situation. Even before the news of her prison transfer, the administration took very little care to make its handling of her appear proper. It sent Blanche, Trump's former personal lawyer, to meet with her. And, of course, Trump has repeatedly left open a pardon. Trump late last week said he didn't know what would be produced from the Blanche meeting, saying, “I don't know because I haven't spoken about it.” But he again suggested it might be limited by a desire not to create suspicion of people who haven't been charged with crimes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Georgia congresswoman declared in an interview that she feels the GOP has lost touch with its base Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of the most prominent voices in Donald Trump's Maga movement, has declared in an interview that she feels that the Republican party has lost touch with its base, and suggested she may abandon the party entirely. “I don't know if the Republican party is leaving me, or if I'm kind of not relating to Republican party as much any more,” Greene said. She did not criticize Trump himself, instead preferring to express her ire for what she attempted to paint as political elites. Her remarks reflect a broader pattern of voter dissatisfaction with traditional party structures. Americans appear to also be holding deeply unfavorable views of both major parties: a July Wall Street Journal poll found 63% view the Democratic party unfavorably, its worst rating in 35 years, while Republicans fare only marginally better in most surveys. Independent or independent-leaning Americans now account for nearly half the electorate, according to July Gallup polling, and public support has increasingly shifted toward Democrats through those leaners in recent months. On Monday, Greene used social media to criticize the lack of accountability over what she deems key issues to the base, sharing a table showing no arrests for the “Russian Collusion Hoax”, “Jan 6th”, and “2020 Election”. I really don't,” she said in the interview. Her recent bills have targeted unconventional Republican territory: preventing cloud-seeding, making English the official US language, and cutting capital gains taxes on homes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marjorie Taylor Greene, historically one of the most prominent voices in Donald Trump's Maga movement, has declared in an interview that she feels that the Republican party has lost touch with its base, but she said she has no plans to leave the party. “No – I'm urging my own party to support ‘America first',” Greene said. Still, she made clear resounding frustration with GOP leadership and her place within the party's planning. “I don't know if the Republican party is leaving me, or if I'm kind of not relating to Republican party as much any more,” Greene said in the Daily Mail interview. She did not criticize Trump himself, instead preferring to express her ire for what she attempted to paint as political elites. Her remarks reflect a broader pattern of voter dissatisfaction with traditional party structures. Americans appear to also be holding deeply unfavorable views of both major parties: a July Wall Street Journal poll found 63% view the Democratic party unfavorably, its worst rating in 35 years, while Republicans fare only marginally better in most surveys. Independent or independent-leaning Americans now account for nearly half the electorate, according to July Gallup polling, and public support has increasingly shifted toward Democrats through those leaners in recent months. On Monday, Greene used social media to criticize the lack of accountability over what she deems key issues to the base, sharing a table showing no arrests for the “Russian Collusion Hoax”, “Jan 6th”, and “2020 Election”. I really don't,” she said in the interview. Her recent bills have targeted unconventional Republican territory: preventing cloud-seeding, making English the official US language, and cutting capital gains taxes on homes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Earlier this year, the Arab Gulf states were riding high. For the first major international trip of his second term, U.S. President Donald Trump visited Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. These countries seemed to be among the few U.S. partners that had cracked the code for dealing with Trump: striking headline-grabbing trillion-dollar megadeals while quietly catering to his family's business interests. Arab Gulf states appeared well-positioned to use their wealth, energy resources, internal stability, and geographical centrality to transition into post-oil nations. They had already established themselves as finance and logistics hubs and had ambitions to further underpin their transformations with nascent advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence capabilities, the development of which depended on industrial partnerships with foreign companies that were testing what was politically acceptable in an era of great-power competition. In June, an intense 12-day war between Iran and Israel, in which the United States delivered major airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, ended with a barrage of intercepted Iranian ballistic missiles illuminating Qatar's night sky. The governments of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE had bet big on Trump in part because they hoped that he could end conflict in the region; that wager has clearly flopped, exposing the Gulf states' political and security vulnerabilities and showing that access to Trump does not always equate to leverage over his policies. Although U.S. and Israeli strikes have probably degraded Iran's nuclear facilities, the war will likely only harden Iran's resolve to acquire a nuclear deterrent to protect against future attack—setting the stage for further rounds of conflict. Meanwhile, Tehran has demonstrated that it is willing and able to take the fight to its neighbors when attacked, offering a glimpse into the Islamic Republic's options for escalation should Israel or the United States do good on their threats of striking again. Failure could result in a perpetually unstable regional order characterized by enduring Iranian hostility, Israeli military dominance, and a United States utterly disinterested in managing the aftereffects of conflict—all of which bodes ill for the Gulf states' economic and security ambitions. But it has also longed for containing Iran's regional influence. First, they began to doubt the United States' commitment to upholding the regional security order after Iran attacked Saudi oil installations in 2019. Trump, then in his first term, declined to protect the Saudis or respond with military force. If an administration Riyadh had aggressively courted failed to come to its aid, what did that augur for long-term security alignment between Washington and the Gulf? That the United States offers Israel unlimited military and political cover only compounds regional leaders' frustrations. Sensing their physical and economic exposure to Iran and chastened by Washington's unreliability, Arab Gulf states orchestrated a thaw with Tehran. Although displays of concord since then have been mostly for show, it is undeniable that Iranian-Saudi relations are better now than at any time in the past 20 years. This equilibrium was only shaken after the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, after which Tehran attacked U.S. military installations located inside a major Qatari base—an outcome the Gulf states had tried to prevent by continually insisting that the United States not use Gulf bases or airspace for its operations. With Tehran's regional capabilities severely limited, Gulf states have further softened their stance, so much so that they are now more willing to accept a deal that limits Iran's nuclear program but doesn't necessarily deny it the ability to enrich uranium for the country's medical research or energy needs. All the Arab Gulf states condemned Israel's assault on Iran—even Bahrain and the UAE, both of which normalized relations with Israel in 2020. Saudi Arabia deemed the attacks “blatant Israeli aggressions against the brotherly Islamic Republic of Iran” and called them “a clear violation of international laws and norms.” Oman, which was meant to host the sixth round of U.S.-Iranian nuclear talks two days after Israel's first attack on Iran, accused Israel of seeking to deliberately “obstruct the diplomatic process and ignite a wider conflict.” Speaking at Davos in January, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan, stated, “A war between Iran and Israel […] is something we should try to avoid as much as possible.” A few days after the first U.S.-Iranian nuclear talks began in Oman, in April, Saudi Arabia's King Salman dispatched Khalid bin Salman, his son and the country's defense minister, to Tehran with an ominous warning for Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei: sign a deal with Trump or risk war with Israel. The Arab Gulf states placed big bets on Trump's peacemaking credentials after he campaigned on promises of ending U.S. involvement in forever wars and defusing conflicts in Eurasia and the Middle East. “I don't see the incoming U.S. administration as contributory to the risk of war,” Farhan told a skeptical crowd at Davos. “On the contrary, President Trump has been quite clear he does not favor conflict.” It was a sentiment that senior Arab Gulf officials often repeated in private discussions. Trump, these officials believed, would stand up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in ways Joe Biden did not. If nothing else, they thought, Trump would be swayed by the prospect of lucrative deals with their countries. Trump pushed Israel to accept a two-month ceasefire in Gaza and worked with Egypt and Qatar to achieve a lasting peace deal. The Trump administration also facilitated several rounds of nuclear talks with Iran and brokered a ceasefire with the Houthis that does not preclude Houthi strikes against Israel. During his visit to Riyadh in May, Trump—at the behest of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—met with Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and lifted U.S. sanctions on that country. It has even captured and occupied some Syrian territory “indefinitely,” forestalling peace between the two countries. But once Israel launched its strikes on Iran and the United States joined in, many illusions were shattered. Despite their disappointment, Gulf states must maintain a delicate balance that requires not antagonizing Trump. As such, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia all issued condemnations of the U.S. attack on Iran, but the criticism was pro forma and muted; Qatar didn't even mention the United States by name. A harsher denunciation may have jeopardized relations with Washington, the countries' main security partner, while war raged on in Iran and even caused Trump to lash out. Subsequent endorsements of Israel's attack by European Union member states, including France and Germany, as well as the United Kingdom will have disqualified such countries, in the Iranian view, as honest and credible intermediaries. Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials made no secret of their desire to topple the Iranian regime. In remarks after Israel's first strikes, Netanyahu claimed that his country was “clearing the path” for Iranians' freedom from “an evil and oppressive regime.” Netanyahu did not rule out assassinating Khamenei, and Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, stated that the supreme leader “cannot continue to exist.” In a social media post following the U.S. air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, Trump indicated he might support regime change “if the current Iranian regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN.” Having survived Israel's onslaught, however, the regime is likely to bolster its nuclear program and improve its missile capabilities to deter or retaliate against future attack. The Islamic Republic may emerge from the war in a state similar to Iraq's following the Gulf War: led by a paranoid and militarized regime that deals with internal dissent with an iron fist and holds regional de-escalation hostage to a greater struggle with Israel and the United States. Iran also has multiple escalatory options, including launching lethal attacks on U.S. bases and forces in the region, disabling the Arab Gulf states' energy infrastructure via attacks, and closing the Strait of Hormuz, through which most of the Arab Gulf states' oil and liquefied natural gas exports flow. Arab Gulf states would be deeply unnerved by an angry Iran that threatens its neighbors with short-range missiles and drones and disrupts maritime traffic in the Gulf. Arab Gulf states also doubt that, in the event of future Iranian attacks on their countries, the United States will provide long-lasting military aid. After its rapid and stunning military success, Israel may also feel further emboldened to resort to unprovoked military attacks rather than diplomacy. Like Iran, Israel views the region as an open theater of conflict, and it has carried out military operations in Gaza, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen with little regard for the attacks' legal merits or their effects on these countries' populations and neighbors. Arab Gulf states are deeply worried about Netanyahu's stated desire to “redraw” the Middle East, which would almost certainly ignore or downgrade their interests and could well re-energize the kinds of extremist forces that they have spent two decades fighting, including al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and the Islamic State (also known as isis). It conjures an image of Israel thriving as an impenetrable garrison easily managing the military threats of the fractured statelets surrounding it: a state of affairs that almost all countries in the region would regard as a recipe for permanent instability. The Arab Gulf states' core strategic interest is denying any power—Iran, Israel, or even a third actor such as Turkey—the ability to dominate the region. They believed that Trump would help advance this vision by tying it to broader economic interests. But ultimately, Netanyahu's grand project won over the Oval Office. Conditions are still in place for a repeat of direct hostilities between Iran and Israel, despite the former's weakened state. Iran remains intent on rebuilding its nuclear program and enriching uranium domestically, a position it held onto even at the height of the 12-day war. Like Iraq in the 1990s, Iran may seek to conceal its nuclear program even further. Iranian allegations that the agency served as an intelligence-gathering platform for Israel and the Iranian parliament's subsequent approval of a bill suspending cooperation with it both suggest that the Islamic Republic is even less likely to abide by transparency measures going forward. The ambiguity surrounding Iran's nuclear program will remain unsettling for its foes and for its Arab Gulf neighbors, which dread instability. Under Israel's Begin Doctrine, which prescribes preventive warfare against adversaries capable of developing weapons of mass destruction, further ambiguity over the state of Iran's nuclear program may serve as casus belli for future hostilities. In the absence of other credible intermediaries, they should attempt to facilitate a nuclear deal between Iran and the United States themselves. And the Gulf states stand a better chance than most at success. Qatar's critical role in bringing the war to an end, largely by absorbing Iran's face-saving attack, will raise its political capital in Tehran. From Iran's perspective, Oman has established itself as a trusted intermediary, while the influence of Saudi Arabia and the UAE in Washington is a valuable asset, even if that influence appears to be diminishing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian S-300 surface-to-air missile system in the Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine's General Staff said on Aug. 4. The S-300 is a long-range surface-to-air missile system that intercepts aircraft, cruise and ballistic missiles. Developed by the Soviet Union, it remains a key component of Russia's air defense and, depending on the variant, can engage multiple targets at ranges of up to 150 kilometers (93 miles). The destruction of this target deals a significant blow to the Russian long-range fire capabilities, limiting its ability to strike Ukrainian positions and civilian infrastructure in the region, according to Ukraine's General Staff. "Ukrainian forces continue to systematically destroy key elements of Russia's military capabilities, weakening the enemy's ability to carry out combat operations, hold illegally occupied territories, and sustain the occupation," the General Staff said. Kateryna Hodunova is a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a sports journalist in several Ukrainian outlets and was the deputy chief editor at Suspilne Sport. She holds a bachelor's degree in political journalism from Taras Shevchenko University and a master's degree in political science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. Among those detained are lawmaker Oleksii Kuznetsov and former Luhansk Oblast Governor Serhii Haidai. Beijing insists it will continue to secure its energy supplies based on national interests despite pressure from Washington and the threat of punitive tariffs. Satellite imagery captured in July 2025 shows visible changes at the airport. Baltic states have been raising alarms about a growing Russian threat to the region and NATO. Drones operated by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) targeted an airfield in the city of Saky. The SBU has detained several people this year accused of working for Russian forces in Ukraine. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that a total of 61 Ukrainian drones were shot down over various regions of the country overnight. U.S. President Donald Trump said that his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, may travel to Russia on Aug. 6 or 7 — just days before a deadline for Moscow to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face secondary tariffs targeting its oil exports.</p>

One colleague was recently arrested, and others faced threats. Authoritarian governments exploit crises – gang violence, migration, a war – to tighten their grip on power. Like powerful currents that cross all boundaries, authoritarians don't recognize borders. From Hungary to El Salvador, from Tanzania to Serbia, Russia and China, we are witnessing sophisticated repressive tactics targeting civic groups, philanthropies, private companies, universities, lawyers – any independent voice that dares to speak against power. Because when citizens unite around a common cause, they can overwhelm the power of any despot. El Salvador approves changes allowing Bukele to seek indefinite re-election In June, 50 democracy champions from more than 30 countries – predominantly from the Global South – gathered to identify how to assert the power of citizens over autocrats. Despite their different backgrounds, the group concluded that this moment demands a reimagining of democracy itself. These conversations revealed something powerful: when people from across the world unite with shared vision, they become a force of nature. Democratic transformation does not come from navigating existing currents – it comes from recognizing that diverse groups working together with intention can generate the momentum needed to shift entire political landscapes. Traditional approaches to support democracy – relying on governments and international institutions – aren't keeping up with the speed and sophistication of modern authoritarianism. As those institutional actors stumble, large and inclusive coalitions across society show greater capacity to lead. So how can Canada help build it? They recognized that we can't wait for institutions to save us. They are creating a Global Freedom Charter – a collective agreement about the kind of momentum we want to create together, connecting democratic principles and human rights: clean water, food security, economic opportunity and safety from violence. Democracy defenders have too often let authoritarians control the narrative. In a leaderless world, democracy's future depends on communities of people who understand that they can create their own momentum. But just as Canada has shown the world, citizens in country after country are discovering their own power to drive change. From Bangladesh to Kenya citizens are moving together with shared intention – and changing not just what is possible, but what is inevitable. Canada must help lead this global effort. By investing in global democratic connections, we can build stable societies, reliable alliances and stronger economies. Canada has already inspired the world with its defence of democracy. Now is the moment to stand with citizens around the world who are fighting to defend theirs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia maintains a responsible position regarding nuclear rhetoric and would prefer not to be drawn into discussion on the subject, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. "Overall, of course, we do not wish to be drawn into such discussion or comment on it. We approach any statements related to nuclear issues with great caution. As you know, Russia holds a responsible position. President Putin's stance is well known," Peskov said. He also noted that that all parties must be extremely cautious in their use of nuclear rhetoric. "Russia takes the issue of nuclear non-proliferation very seriously. And, of course, we believe that everyone should be extremely careful when it comes to nuclear rhetoric," the Kremlin spokesman told reporters. Earlier, US President Donald Trump stated on the social media platform Truth Social that he ordered the redeployment of two American nuclear submarines allegedly due to comments made by Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev. From Trump's perspective, Medvedev made provocative statements on nuclear topics.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Convicts in minimum-security jail angered by transfer of Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine's Maxwell's arrival at a minimum-security prison in Texas has provoked anger among her fellow inmates. A prisoner at Federal Prison Camp (FPC) Bryan told The Telegraph she was “disgusted” by Maxwell's transfer and that her feelings were widely shared by other inmates at the facility. Maxwell, the British socialite and former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein, was quietly moved to the prison camp 100 miles outside Houston, Texas, this week from a stricter low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida. Her new prison mostly houses inmates convicted of “white-collar” crimes and low-level offences, and they are said to be angry that Maxwell is being held among them. Inmates at minimum-security institutions, also known as FPCs, benefit from low prison guard-to-inmate ratio and limited-to-no perimeter fencing. The transfer comes a week after she was interviewed by Todd Blanche, Donald Trump's deputy attorney general, leading to intense speculation that some sort of deal has been cut. Mr Trump has come under pressure in recent weeks to release all information related to Epstein, after the Department of Justice and FBI concluded that he died by suicide and did not possess a “client list”. During a nine-hour interrogation with Mr Blanche, Maxwell was allegedly grilled about Epstein's connections to Bill Clinton, the Duke of York and Bill Gates, as well several other billionaires, according to the Daily Mail. Maxwell's legal team have said she is willing to testify before Congress in exchange for a presidential pardon or having her sentence commuted – a possibility Mr Trump has not ruled out. Her comments will only fuel concern that could be targeted at the facility, preventing her testimony about Epstein from ever seeing the light of day. Maxwell was allegedly moved under the cover of darkness because she had been “bombarded” with death threats from r apists who accused her of being a “snitch”, according to the Mail on Sunday. “There were real fears inside Tallahassee that they could not guarantee her safety, which is why she was moved.” In an email sent from prison about Maxwell's transfer, she wrote: “I am honestly shocked she was moved to a federal prison camp with her history and charges.” Her daughter also allegedly became pregnant as a result and Howell said she has since adopted the child. Howell said that the circumstances surrounding her daughter being shot provoked her mental health spiral and addiction to gambling, which she funded by resorting to theft. In January, she pleaded guilty to stealing almost $1m from Tarleton State University, her former employer, between 2022 and 2024. Howell said: “I don't blame anyone else for the actions that brought me to FPC Bryan, but I can definitely say that the circumstances that surrounded my daughter being shot were what sparked my spiral and addiction to gambling to escape my reality. She said: “This is a camp you can literally walk out of. Regardless of her reasoning, I don't think she belongs here.”</p>
