                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a Monday note to staffers, Steve Boom, Amazon's vice president of audio, Twitch and games, said the company is consolidating some Wondery units under its Audible audiobook and podcasting division. Wondery CEO Jen Sargent is also stepping down from her role, Boom said. "These changes will not only better align our teams as they work to take advantage of the strategic opportunities ahead but, even more crucially, will ensure we have the right structure in place to deliver the very best experience to creators, customers and advertisers," Boom wrote in the memo, which was viewed by CNBC. "Unfortunately, these changes also include some role reductions, and we have notified those employees this morning." Bloomberg was first to report on the job cuts. The move comes nearly five years after Amazon acquired Wondery as part of a push to expand its catalog of original audio content. The podcasting company made a name for itself with hit shows like "Dirty John" and "Dr. More recently, Wondery signed several lucrative licensing deals with Jason and Travis Kelce's "New Heights" podcast, along with Dax Shepard's "Armchair Expert." Amazon is streamlining "how Wondery further integrates" into the company by separating the teams that oversee its narrative podcasts from those developing "creator-led shows," Boom wrote. The narrative podcasting unit will consolidate under Audible, and creator-led content will move to a new unit within Boom's organization in Amazon called "creator services," he wrote. Amazon's audio pursuits face a heightened challenge from the growing popularity of video podcasts on Alphabet's YouTube, which now hosts an increasing number of shows. Video shows require different discovery, growth and monetization strategies than "audio-first, narrative series," Boom wrote in the memo to Amazon staffers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of American Eagle surged more than 20% on Monday after President Donald Trump complimented the retailer's marketing campaign with actress Sydney Sweeney. "Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the 'HOTTEST' ad out there. Shortly after Trump's post, shares of American Eagle jumped, and were still trading more than 20% higher in afternoon trading. Monday's gains come a little over a week after American Eagle first announced that the "Euphoria" star would headline its fall marketing campaign with the slogan: "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans." The slogan American Eagle chose for the campaign — "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans" — has led some far-left critics to say the remark was a double entendre. Instead of being about pants, it was really about the actress' genetics and the fact that she has blonde hair and blue eyes, critics said. The ad also faced pushback more widely for being overly sexualized and out of touch, reminiscent of previous marketing norms that many say no longer resonate with the public. American Eagle has stayed largely quiet on the matter — releasing a brief statement on its Instagram account on Friday that said the slogan "is and always was about the jeans." "We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way," the company said. The saga highlights the tightrope that marketers are walking when deciding what types of ads to run and the audiences they should be targeting when consumer attention is harder than ever to win and maintain. Bud Lite's ill-fated Dylan Mulvaney collaboration and the subsequent impact on its sales and its parent company's stock price, highlighted how things can go wrong when companies release marketing that some may consider "woke." On the other hand, American Eagle's campaign is now showing the other side of that coin – what can happen when a company releases marketing that isn't "woke" and perhaps more accepted on the cultural right. In the lead-up to American Eagle's campaign with Sweeney, the company has been struggling to grow sales, and the marketing blitz is one of the many things it's doing to reverse that negative slump. It's too early to say if the campaign has positively or negatively impacted sales, but it has made American Eagle more top of mind with shoppers. Google trend data shows search interest for American Eagle is at its highest level in more than 20 years. Whether or not that search interest translates to more shoppers buying jeans from American Eagle will be more clear when the retailer reports earnings, which is expected in the next few weeks. As of Friday's close, shares of American Eagle were down more than 27% so far this year as the company grapples with larger macroeconomic concerns related to tariffs, consumer spending and its own merchandising missteps. Earlier this year, the company said it would take a $75 million write-down in spring and summer merchandise after it pulled its full-year guidance due to slow sales, steep discounting and a volatile macroeconomic environment. For its current quarter, American Eagle said in May that it expects revenue to fall 5%, comparable sales to be down 3% and gross margin to be lower compared with the prior year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said on Monday he will substantially raise tariffs on goods from India over its purchases of Russian oil. "India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits. They don't care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. "Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA." He did not elaborate on what the tariff would be. India's trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump last week said he would impose a 25% tariff on goods imported from India and added that the world's fifth-largest economy would also face an unspecified penalty but gave no details. Over the weekend, two Indian government sources told Reuters that India will keep purchasing oil from Russia despite U.S. Trump's threats. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump and one of his top economic advisors on Monday stoked baseless conspiracies about federal jobs data, suggesting without evidence that Friday's weaker-than-expected employment report had been "rigged" by federal workers bent on sabotaging the president. "All over the U.S. government, there have been people who have been resisting Trump everywhere they can," National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Monday on CNBC. Trump, meanwhile, claimed on social media that the report, which painted a dour picture of the economy, was "RIGGED" and the previous months' revisions had been "CONCOCTED in order to make a great Republican Success look less stellar!!!" "To make sure that the data are as transparent and as reliable as possible, we're going to get highly qualified people in there that have a fresh start and a fresh set of eyes on the problem," said Hassett. Trump abruptly fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday. Monday's comments from Trump and Hassett were the latest effort by the White House to criticize the labor statistic bureau's work in order to retroactively justify McEntarfer's firing. But they also went a step further, planting the idea that any government economic data which does not fit neatly into Trump's political narrative must, by definition, be false and manipulated by partisan federal employees. When the monthly jobs report from BLS is good news for the White House, Trump is quick to claim credit for the growth and point to the BLS-supplied figures as proof that his economic plans are working. "GREAT JOB NUMBERS, FAR BETTER THAN EXPECTED. Trump wrote on social media this spring after job growth in March came in better than expected. Fast forward a few months, and Trump and his top aides now contend that the BLS data cannot be trusted, and the downward revisions to the last two months' jobs reports were phony. In his Monday post, Trump drew a straight line between the jobs report and the voting process. "Last weeks Job's Report was RIGGED, just like the numbers prior to the Presidential Election were Rigged," Trump wrote. There is no evidence, however, that the jobs report data was manipulated, and revisions in the data are common. The reports typically become more accurate in the months after an initial report is filed, as more data flows in from business that report their hiring and firing numbers.. "The commissioner doesn't do anything to collect the numbers," former BLS chief William Beach, who was appointed by Trump, said Sunday on CNN as he slammed the decision to fire McEntarfer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla CEO Elon Musk was awarded an interim pay package of 96 million shares of the company over the weekend. The shares would be worth about $29 billion. The company said in a filing Sunday that the pay package would vest in two years as long as Musk continued as CEO or in another key executive position. The new award would be forfeited if the legal battle over his 2018 compensation ends with Musk being able to exercise the larger pay package, which was valued at $56 billion. In January, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick upheld a prior ruling in the case, Tornetta v. Musk, that the compensation plan was improperly granted. Tesla shareholders approved the pay package in June 2024. Musk's 2018 pay package included a set of performance targets for the company, which were all achieved. The judge called it "the largest potential compensation opportunity ever observed in public markets" in her January decision and said it was 33 times higher than the nearest comparison, which was Musk's prior compensation package. The pay announcement comes following a weak earnings report from the EV maker in which Tesla missed on the top and bottom lines, with sales falling for a second straight quarter and automotive revenue dropping 16%. Musk acknowledged the looming loss of EV tax credits on a call with analysts following the report. "We probably could have a few rough quarters. The company has another shareholder meeting in November. CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine said that it stole troves of classified information on Russia's newest nuclear missile submarine during a recent operation, including data that points to the vessel's vulnerabilities. Specialists working for Ukraine's military intelligence agency, the HUR, breached the Russian Navy and obtained internal documents concerning the new Project 955A Borei-class submarine Knyaz Pozharsky, which entered service less than two weeks ago. It said that its intelligence agents also obtained access to the crew regulations, instructions for transferring wounded sailors and cargo, engineering documents, towing procedures, and details about the submarine's schedule. Russia's defense ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the theft. The Ukrainian intel operation could be a setback for the Russian Navy and expose vulnerabilities within its Project 955A-class submarines, a key element of Moscow's nuclear triad — alongside its arsenal of ground- and air-launched missiles — and considered to be among its most advanced submarines. Among them are five of the improved Project 955A "Borei-A" class variants. These stealthy, nuclear-powered boats are 170 meters long and can travel at speeds of 29 knots, or 33 mph, when submerged. Each of the Project 955A vessels, like Knyaz Pozharskiy, can carry 16 RSM-56 Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) equipped with nuclear warheads. The strategic RSM-56 is a three-stage solid propellant intercontinental ballistic missile that's been in service since 2013. The missile has an estimated range of over 8,000 kilometers and can carry up to 10 independently targetable warheads, each carrying about 100-150 kilotons of nuclear material. The submarines can also carry a dozen torpedoes. Construction of the new Knyaz Pozharskiy began in 2016, and the vessel was commissioned into service just recently on July 24 at a ceremony attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russian submarine and underwater activity, especially in the Arctic region, has increasingly become a focus for NATO.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Susana Pacheco accepted a housekeeping job at a casino on the Las Vegas Strip 16 years ago, she believed it was a step toward stability for her and her 2-year-old daughter. But the single mom found herself exhausted, falling behind on bills and without access to stable health insurance, caught in a cycle of low pay and little support. For years, she said, there was no safety net in sight — until now. Experts say the Culinary Union's success is a notable exception in a national landscape where union membership overall is declining. "Together, we've shown that change can be a positive force, and I'm confident that this partnership will continue to benefit us all in the years to come," Patrick Nichols, president and CEO of the Venetian, said shortly after workers approved the deal. Pacheco says their new contract has already reshaped her day-to-day life. The housekeeper no longer races against the clock to clean an unmanageable number of hotel suites, and she's spending more quality time with her children because of the better pay and guaranteed days off. "Now with the union, we have a voice," Pacheco said. These gains come at a time when union membership nationally is at an all-time low, and despite Republican-led efforts over the years to curb union power. About 10% of U.S. workers belonged to a union in 2024, down from 20% in 1983, the first year for which data is available, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics. President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order seeking to end collective bargaining for certain federal employees that led to union leaders suing the administration. Nevada and more than two dozen other states now have so-called "right to work" laws that let workers opt out of union membership and dues. GOP lawmakers have also supported changes to the National Labor Relations Board and other regulatory bodies, seeking to reduce what they view as overly burdensome rules on businesses. Ruben Garcia, professor and director of the workplace program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas law school, said the Culinary Union's resilience stems from its deep roots in Las Vegas, its ability to adapt to the growth and corporatization of the casino industry, and its long history of navigating complex power dynamics with casino owners and operators. A few powerful companies — MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts — now control most of the dozens of casinos along Las Vegas Boulevard. "That consolidation can make things harder for workers in some ways, but it also gives unions one large target," Garcia said. But a last-minute deal with Caesars narrowly averted the walkout, and it triggered a domino effect across the Strip, with the union quickly finalizing similar deals for workers at MGM Resorts and Wynn properties. Union casino workers will earn an average $35 hourly, including benefits, by the end of it. With its ability to mobilize thousands of its members for canvassing and voter outreach, the union's endorsements are highly coveted, particularly among Democrats, and can signal who has the best shot at winning working-class votes. The union's path hasn't always been smooth, though. Michael Green, a history professor at UNLV, noted the Culinary Union has long faced resistance. "Historically, there have always been people who are anti-union," Green said. Earlier this year, two food service workers in Las Vegas filed federal complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the union of deducting dues despite their objections to union membership. "I don't think Culinary Union bosses deserve my support," said one of the workers, Renee Guerrero, who works at T-Mobile Arena on the Strip. "Their actions since I attempted to exercise my right to stop dues payments only confirms my decision." But longtime union members like Paul Anthony see things differently. Anthony, a food server at the Bellagio and a Culinary member for nearly 40 years, said his union benefits — free family health insurance, reliable pay raises, job security and a pension — helped him to build a lasting career in the hospitality industry. "A lot of times it is an industry that doesn't have longevity," he said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla has unveiled a new $29 billion pay package for Elon Musk. The EV giant's board announced on Monday that it had granted Musk a "good faith" CEO performance award of 96 million restricted shares of Tesla stock, worth just over $29 billion based on the stock's current value. It comes as Musk's 2018 pay package, which was worth about $46.8 billion in June, remains in limbo after being struck down by a Delaware judge last December. In a letter to shareholders, the Tesla board members Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson said the new package was necessary to "retain and incentivize" Musk amid an "ever-intensifying AI talent war." "The war for AI talent is intensifying, with recent months including multi-billion-dollar acquisitions of companies and nine-figure cash compensation packages for non-founder, individual AI engineers," Denholm and Wilson-Thompson wrote. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing also posted on X, the Tesla board members said the new $29 billion "CEO Interim Award" would include a requirement that Musk serve continuously in a senior leadership role at Tesla during the two-year vesting term. The award is also structured to "incrementally increase" Musk's voting rights upon grant. Musk has repeatedly expressed concern about his level of control over Tesla. Denholm and Wilson-Thompson wrote that Tesla's board had voted unanimously to award Musk the interim award, with Musk and his brother, Kimbal, recusing themselves. Tesla shareholders would have a chance to vote on a longer-term CEO compensation strategy at the company's annual shareholder meeting in November, the letter added, and the interim award would be forfeited or returned if Musk's 2018 pay package is reinstated to avoid a "double dip."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altman posted a seemingly innocuous comment on X praising the animated sci-fi show "Pantheon." The show is a cult favorite in tech circles and tackles themes like artificial general intelligence. In response, one X user asked if GPT-5 also recommends the show. Altman responded with a screenshot and said, "turns out yes!" It is one of the first public glimpses of GPT-5, which is expected to be more powerful than earlier models, feature a larger context window, be able to take on more agentic tasks, and have multimodal capabilities. OpenAI is under pressure to unveil a flashy new model as competitors like Google Deepmind, Meta, xAI, and Anthropic continue to nip at its heels. The bot said Pantheon has a "100% critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes" and is "cerebral, emotional, and philosophically intense." Business Insider confirmed that it does have a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. One review described it as "gripping, cerebral, remarkably high-concept." Another called it "a portrait of a rapidly changing world that takes care to document the emotional carnage left in its wake."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ernest Ang, the 24-year-old founder of Kokoyo Nyonya Delights, a Peranakan eatery in Singapore. It has been edited for length and clarity. My family always feared I'd burn it down. So when I told my grandmother that I wanted to start my own restaurant, she thought it was just another one of my crazy ideas — I'd had many growing up. She used to run a hawker stall selling Peranakan food. Peranakan people like me have mixed Chinese and Malay ancestry, so our food is a fusion of Malay, Chinese, and Indian flavors. Last year, I started my own Peranakan food business, battling high rents, difficulty getting customers, and getting used to sweating in a kitchen for hours. I did an electronics engineering diploma but realized I hated the idea of being an engineer. My friends recommended I try something different because my grandma is a good cook, and I love to cook. I decided to take a stab at it. My grandma is very secretive about her recipes. For months, I went to her house with ingredients, trying to watch how she cooked and take notes. This was a challenging process because she measured ingredients based on gut feeling. I finally managed to figure out her recipes and develop a process for cooking for a restaurant. I launched Kokoyo Nyonya Delights in August, after months of practising recipes and an investment of 80,000 Singapore dollars, or about $62,000. Three of my friends helped me out with cooking and operations. My grandmother contributed some of her savings. I couldn't have done it without her investment. My grandmother told me to focus on the most popular Peranakan dishes, like inchi kabin, a fried chicken dish, and beef rendang, which is beef stewed in coconut milk and spices. Everything served at Kokoyo Nyonya has to be vetted by my grandmother. Cooking Peranakan food is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. I get in at around 9 a.m. every day to make everything from scratch, because grandma doesn't like me selling leftovers. Based on my grandma's recipe, just cooking our rice is a 23-step, three-hour-long process. While the first few weeks of operations were smooth, the real challenge came after we had an article written about us, and we started seeing a wave of customers. The crowd was overwhelming, and I realized we couldn't cope with it. That's when I had to abandon some of the things my grandma told me to do, like ditching a wok in favor of a deep fryer to fry chicken. My rent was also too high: SG$13,500 monthly. And there were a lot of older people in the neighborhood where I opened my restaurant. I found that they weren't too willing to spend a lot of money on food. In July, I moved to a smaller stall in a food court near Singapore's Sixth Avenue, a wealthy neighborhood where people are willing to spend more. I've also reduced the number of staff members from four to two. I work seven days a week, which doesn't leave time for much else. I haven't met my friends in a while, unless they come to see me. But I like that it's not a repetitive job. I don't have regrets about trying to start something of my own.</p>
