                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: The Town is abuzz over High Side, a package based on an unpublished short story by Jaime Oliveira that looms as a potential reteam of Timothée Chalamet and James Mangold. They are just coming off A Complete Unknown, the Bob Dylan smash that got eight Oscar nominations. Sugar23, which reps Oliveira, is out to the town with the short story pitch package that also is making a buzz in publishing circles. In High Side, Billy is a former MotoGP racer, who is haunted by a career-ending crash and a family legacy of abandonment but is drawn back into the world of high-speed risks and extreme danger. His estranged brother, already being pursued by the FBI, recruits him for a series of bank robberies on superbikes. A gifted motocross rider, Billy walked away from the sport after a devastating accident, and he has been making do caring for his addict father and the family garage. He's blindsided when his estranged older brother Cole resurfaces — just after their father's death — with a proposition: use Billy's talents for something bigger: robbing banks. Cole assembles a mismatched crew, including a woman who becomes Billy's lover, and they begin knocking over small-town desert banks with speed and precision. But as the stakes rise, Lennox, an FBI agent who has a complicated history with Cole, closes in as the crew preps its biggest score: a bank job timed with a big motorcycle parade. Chalamet is shooting the climax of Dune, and he has the Josh Safdie-directed table tennis drama Marty Supreme coming in December from A24. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 on the Billboard Hot 100, while two adversarial acts from KPop Demon Hunters take their battle to the top 10. “Ordinary” adds a ninth week atop the Hot 100. The song has spent all its weeks on top consecutively, having become Warren's first leader on the chart. Meanwhile, “Golden,” by HUNTR/X — the trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI — holds at its No. 2 Hot 100 high, as “Your Idol,” by Saja Boys — Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee — reaches the top 10, bounding 12-9. The songs, each act's first top 10, are from the hit Netflix animated film KPop Demon Hunters and its soundtrack, which notches a second week at its No. It rules the Soundtracks chart for a sixth week. Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. “Ordinary,” on Atlantic Records, tallied 19.4 million official streams (down 6% week-over-week),  73.3 million radio airplay audience impressions (down 1%) and 6,000 sold (essentially even) in the United States July 25-31. “Ordinary” also makes it a perfect 10 weeks atop the Songs of the Summer chart, having led each week since the survey made its annual seasonal return after Memorial Day. It simultaneously tops Streaming Songs for a second week, up 13% to 28.9 million streams — as it's the Hot 100's top gainer in streaming for a fifth consecutive week. The song, from the hit Netflix animated movie KPop Demon Hunters, also sports surges of 31% to 4.9 million in radio audience and 19% to 5,000 sold, boosted by a remix by David Guetta, released July 25. Despite their on-screen differences, HUNTR/X and Saja Boys team up to make KPop Demon Hunters the first movie to spin off two Hot 100 top 10s since another animated hit: In 2022, Disney's Encanto yielded the ensemble smash “We Don't Talk About Bruno” (No. 1 for five weeks) and “Surface Pressure” by Jessica Darrow (No. 8 peak), with both written solely by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, climbs 4-3 on the Hot 100, after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. Justin Bieber's “Daisies” dips 3-4 on the Hot 100, two weeks after it debuted at No. It's the chart's top gainer in airplay for a second week (17 million, up 61%). Wallen's “Just in Case” keeps at No. 2, and Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” is steady at its No. Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and finished as the year's No. 7 — as it adds a record-extending 102nd week on the chart overall and a record-padding 72nd week in the top 10. Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is stationary at No. 8 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. Capping the Hot 100's top 10, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” remains at No. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

Americana — a modern western from writer-director Tony Tost which follows several people as their lives violently intertwine while fighting over an expensive Native American ghost shirt— was shot in 2022, premiered at SXSW in 2023 and is finally heading to this big screen this month. “I'd been waiting a really long time, I'd been really cautiously picky about what I was going to do for my first project for getting into this world, into this space,” Halsey told The Hollywood Reporter at the film's Los Angeles premiere on Sunday. Little did I know we were going to be making it during COVID, which was a crazy experience. And from the moment I read the script until we started shooting, I got pregnant, had a whole pregnancy, gave birth to my son, had my son on set with me, and without giving anything away, it's really serendipitous to [her character] Mandy's arc in the film.” Trump Swoons Over Sydney Sweeney Amid Reports That She's a Republican The film also stars Sydney Sweeney — who walked the carpet in her first public appearance following her American Eagle controversy — Paul Walter Hauser, Simon Rex, Eric Dane and Zahn McClarnon. “We were actually hanging out a bunch during COVID, so when I got the call she was doing the movie we had like just gone hiking a few days before, so it was like, ‘Oh cool, I'll see you there,'” Halsey recalled. The dark comedy series has also enlisted MaXXXine filmmaker Ti West to direct and executive produce. It's quite relieving,” Halsey explained, confirming that she will not appear on screen in the show. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

Patterson talks to The Hollywood Reporter about how he kept the revival's sense of humor and characters true to the original, and writing for a Disney-owned streamer about a present-day Texas community. In an era of reboots, sequels and seemingly never-ending franchises, the “why now?” of bringing a show like King of the Hill back is “the most important question,” says its new showrunner Saladin K. Patterson. For the adult animated comedy, which debuted its story about a family living in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas, on Fox in 1997, the “why?” begins at San Francisco Sketch Fest 2017. That's when co-creators Mike Judge and Greg Daniels did a table read of an episode from the original series, which had concluded its 13-season run seven years earlier. 'Summer I Turned Pretty' Star Jackie Chung Unpacks Belly and Laurel's Rift, Teases What's Ahead in Season 3 How to Watch Emmy-Winning Animated Series 'King of the Hill' Season 14 Online “There are always memes online, [fans asking], ‘I wonder how Hank Hill will respond to this?' In the meantime, the series — which picks up with Hank Hill returning from a decade-long stint living and working in Saudi Arabia — has returned following a new model for how TV is animated and voice-casted, a dramatic transformation in how series are released and consumed, and a culture of comedy that has undergone an expansion (and revaluation) of what audiences collectively find funny. Patterson doesn't shy away from those things on-screen in the writing or off-screen while talking about the returning series. Instead, he openly shares exactly how those things did — and didn't — affect his pitch for a rebooted King of the Hill. That vision is what he chalks up to a return to the middle ground that acknowledges the overtone window on a lot of things have radically shifted. The result is a reboot that works to be both what the animated series always was — a satire about a conservative father and his family in a small Texas town — and what the moment is, in an organic and authentic way. “[King of the Hill] was maybe about that common thread that goes through all these people,” voice star Toby Huss tells THR. You are a veteran of the sitcom space, with credits on Frasier, The Bernie Mac Show, Big Bang Theory, and more recently Shifting Gears. As someone so familiar with comedic sitcoms who has already helmed taking a classic into the modern day via reboot, what warrants King of the Hill‘s return for you? With King of the Hill, when I sat down with Mike and Greg and they were meeting with me to potentially be the showrunner, I told them the things that stood out to me about why it was interesting to do this reboot now. In the original, the character of Hank Hill (voiced by Judge) had a strong point of view, and was a very strong character known for representing a common sense middle ground. The backstory they came up with — which I think was very smart — was of sending Hank and Peggy (Kathy Najimy) away to Saudi Arabia to work on the Aramco base for about 10 years King of the Hill time then bringing Hank back to a community and country that has changed some. I specify “cultural” because a lot of people, probably me included, when we talk about the original, tended to say it was a political show that made political commentary. That was where the show was, but it's also small relatable stories through the points of view of our characters. And taking the opportunity that we can now have our main character have a totally different not only view of culture, but way the culture views him. That's where a lot of the comedic conflict comes from. Those might not always align because of how comedy ages, which underscores how hard a medium comedy is in terms of translation over time. But when you were talking to Mike and Greg, what was the central comedic tension of the original series, and how did that stay the same or change at all for this return? I'll answer it by using an example from the original. One of the quotes that always stands out to me was from the episode where Khan (Ronny Chieng) and Minh (Lauren Tom) first move in next door, and then Hank and Khan immediately butt heads because Khan is an asshole. Hank's point of view is, “What kind of country is this where I can only hate a man if he's white?” That speaks a lot to the irony that a character like Hank will find himself in. So that when he does something, it's interpreted based on what people think a character like him would feel. I hate him because he is an asshole.” That's where a lot of rich comedic irony lives, and that's what I wanted to make sure we carried over into this version of it — putting Hank in situations where people are going to accuse him or judge him or make assumptions that are based on who they think he is, or who they think he's supposed to be, and not based on who he actually is. That's very interesting to me, and that's where I think the show lives when it lives at its best comedic potential. Fox — like Adult Swim and MTV — carved out a unique space for adult animation that was really edgy and boundary-pushing, something Disney hadn't really delved into until it acquired Fox titles. How did answering to Disney versus Fox, and a streamer versus a broadcaster, shape how you approached this show? Yes, Fox back then with adult animation let certain shows really push the envelope. But there were situations where the Disney of it all put some limiters on us that I know Fox would not have, even though we were on Hulu and streaming, which theoretically has broader S&P [standards and practices] than Fox. But for us, staying true to the show meant we weren't ever going to be too gratuitous with the curse words and things, but we do take some liberties. That being said, Hulu still made us go through and pull out all the F-bombs because they don't want the TV-MA label, and it's fine. I'm not a huge fan of shows pushing the envelope in that way anyway, so it wasn't a big loss, but it was ironic, especially considering, like you said, the history of the show being on Fox where the whole purpose was to try to push the envelope as much as you could. When King of the Hill was in its initial run on Fox, its first season was actually only like 12 episodes. But that and later seasons, which were 20-plus episodes released weekly in a time when people sat in front of TVs at a specific time each night. Did the shift in platform and distribution model affect at all how you all thought about writing it now? So a microcosm of that is this whole thing that a season is 10 episodes now, and that certainly affects the stories we can tell, but not all in a bad way. Trust me, the unspoken secret that we always had was it's hard doing 22 episodes, and by time you get to episode 17, you're starting to repeat yourself probably. But monetarily speaking, that was a great model. Now for streamers like Hulu and Disney Plus, it's a little different. When we were breaking out the season arc, it certainly made us skip ahead, I think, in a way that we wouldn't necessarily have skipped ahead in the first 10 episodes under the broadcast model. Think about the Connie (Tom) and Bobby's (Pamela Adlon) relationship. It makes us have to be a little more selective with what we have our characters experience if we're trying to get them to the same place by the end of a season. This show is not something entirely new for King of the Hill, but there are new elements that expand Hank's universe. You do that by bringing in more characters, changing voice actors of others along with the rest of the industry, and adding new locations that offer different interactions. We have an opportunity to do some stuff now under a different societal lens than the original show was under. Specifically, that's both to casting people of color who are the same background as the characters that they're portraying and casting a wider net to be able to include more people in the casting conversation. But then, like you said, in terms of the characters that then populate the world that Hank experiences, it's not as simple as me saying I'm a Black writer and I want to see more Black characters in King of the Hill. Bernie Mac played a character; Chris Rock and Snoop Dogg. That show lived in a world where the stories they were telling didn't necessitate, necessarily, Hank interacting that much with other people. The writing staff before we started all took a field trip to Dallas because we wanted to see what's changed over the last 10 years. It kind of bucks the stereotype because people think things are so polarized. It gave us an opportunity to say, “All right, who would we like to see Hank interacting with — but for the purpose of showing Hank in these new environments in the same way we show him other in other environments while having a strong point of view, being someone who represents a common ground amongst people, and as someone who follows a certain set of rules that other people can rally around.” That felt like a good opportunity. A Black barber shop is filled with people who also have similar points of view and, if not similar points of view, similar approaches to things, strong opinions, but welcoming to others because part of growth is also hearing from others, right? And I guess that boils down to: Where do we think fans will want to see Hank and who do we think fans would want to see Hank interact with? Toby Huss was in a really unique position with this show's return, both stepping back from playing Kahn and then continuing the role of Dale Gribble, who was voiced by the late Johnny Hardwick. How did you all work with Toby to handle the Kahn shift and then how did you land on the decision to continue on with Dale using Toby to voice? Toby almost led the charge in terms of realizing it's time to pass and let someone else play the voice of Khan. When Johnny unfortunately passed away, we first and foremost wanted to see what's going to honor Johnny and his family in the best way. So it felt like he still needed to stay an organic part of the show, so that meant carrying on. So we first and foremost wanted to make sure that that was going to be handled in the most respectful way and a way that we'd be proud of. After that, it became, creatively, what's best for the show? We looked at all the options you would think we would look at; recasting, using some sort of other technology to try to keep the voice going. What felt the most respectful and also creatively strong was taking Toby, who was a friend of Johnny's, who was like a brother to Johnny in certain ways, and having him do it in a way that would pay homage to Johnny. What people don't know is the cast will always take turns doing each other's characters like at a table read. That was a part of the family dynamic, anyway, so that felt like it was a natural extension of what the cast did amongst themselves. That's also why Toby was a good choice. Among the cast who are no longer with us are Brittany Murphy and Tom Petty, who were behind the characters of Luanne and Lucky. Did you consider bringing them back and how did you want to pay tribute to them even though they aren't present? As you can imagine, a lot of thought went into that. Brittany Murphy unfortunately passed away as they were in the original run, and they had to deal with it. They had already been dealing with her being so busy because of her movies and things, that the characters had already been phased out a little bit towards the end. Our decision was, do we revitalize that character or not? The analogy that I've been using is as a sports fan, sometimes you have a player who has meant so much to a team and an organization in terms of what they accomplished and what they represented, that when they are no longer with the team, the best thing you can do to honor them is to hang the jersey up in the rafters and to retire the number. Hopefully, if fans stick around and Hulu allows us to do more episodes, you'll see a way that we have come up with to address where they are, at least in a reference way. You keep that tradition up in this season, from The Summer I Turned Pretty to Ted Lasso. Topically, you've also got more broad signifiers of the time: ethical nonmonogony, AI, parenting vlogs, Jeffrey Epstein. Were you at all concerned about how that might in the future age your show? So not only were we concerned, there's an extra level of concern that you have for animation, because it takes nine months for an episode to kind of come out when they're animated. Not only do we run the risk of dating ourselves in terms of future people watching the show as an, “Oh crap, that's such a 2025 reference,” the first time people see it, the reference could be old, because it was nine months later. So I'll say this, when we did make a pop culture reference, it first and foremost had to feel true to the character that was saying it. For us, the character had to be doing it. Hopefully, when it's watched in the future, it'll feel like we were making a statement about the time period that this show existed. That doesn't mean The Summer I Turned Pretty won't feel like a very dated reference 10 to 20 years from now. Viewers likely have questions about how you bring a number of these characters back, but Dale is really a stand out, especially in the Bush Library visit episode. He's a conspiracy theorist, and has always pushed misinformation and disinformation in ways people likely thought were harmless, but we're currently seeing isn't so harmless. How did you think about writing him in this moment? Did you feel any pressure to tone him down, to challenge him any more than Hank already does? When I first met with Greg and Mike and we talked about how I would approach showrunning, I used Dale as an example because I felt the strength of the show and addressing the why now of it all is that Hank stays the same Hank, but his middle is not the middle anymore. Dale staying the same Dale was a way to passively make social commentary about how crazy reality has become to where now people take conspiracy theories much more extremely than Dale and treat them as fact and truth to where Dale can be the one to point and say, “I'm not that crazy.” That is such a unique position for Dale to be in, even though he'll always be the craziest. I was of the opinion, let's leave Dale where he is because that gives us an opportunity to in and of itself make a statement. I have to ask about is the art styling for this because that's really part of how you tell story in animation, and is also impacted by the industry moment you're making a show in. Can you talk about the decision-making behind that? I get it, and I get why people who want to revisit the show may be taken aback a little bit. If they exist, they certainly don't exist at a cost where you can do a TV show. So it has to be updated, and so we updated it with the current style and makeup of animation that animated shows do. I admit it does look different and maybe jarring to some people. I just want to put out there that even though it's updated, we still went and tried to give it an age old look, to make it feel more like the color palette and the landscape of the original, more so than other shows. We certainly went through a lot of back and forth with the background designers and things like that, to make our colors feel closer to what they felt in the original and the tones and things the most that we could. You end with “The Sound Investment,” which explores pensions, start-ups, and stark market manipulation. There's different outcomes for folks, but John Redcorn ends up getting an investment from The Hills. You also feature a tribute card to Jonathan here. Can you talk about that and if you've thought about how the show might move forward without Joss? It also felt fitting because his tragic passing was so recent and the finale was the last episode produced. King of the Hill is now streaming on Hulu.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's always been a loose, fun vibe whenever Conan O'Brien interviews Timothy Olyphant. Olyphant played TV actor James Stacy in Quentin Tarantino's 2019 film, and he's apparently been invited back for the sequel, which David Fincher is directing for Netflix. Over the course of a funny, characteristically bit-filled conversation with his old friend, the subject of Once Upon A Time… came up. O'Brien hadn't heard that the sequel was officially greenlit, to which Olyphant gave an affirmative “Yep” before mouthing to co-host and producer Matt Gourley, I'm in it. That would've flown if the podcast was truly audio only, but he quickly realized he was on camera: “Are they filming this?” he asked with a laugh. “That camera just caught whatever you did,” co-host Sona Movsesian warned him. They asked him if he wants them to cut the admission out of the episode, and Olyphant sheepishly replied, “I don't know… let's see.” You can check out the full pantomime below around the 43:19 minute mark: But my understanding is I'm in it,” he mouthed, continuing the bit. Rather than be excited about getting a big scoop on the podcast, O'Brien was indignant that Olyphant hadn't revealed the news to him sooner. “I think you would've told me that. You knew what a huge fan I am of the first film. We've got a lot of things going on.” Olyphant started the episode laughing that The Hollywood Reporter would write up a news item about his butt double on Stick, but turns out he was sitting on a much more juicy piece of info!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But there are times when it seems trickier to coax another Saturday Night Live legend turned beloved movie star into actually showing up for his films. By all accounts, Eddie Murphy will cooperate in the sense of accepting a job (presumably through the traditional channels) and hitting his marks as expected. In the streaming era, he seems downright eager to work, having made half a dozen movies for Amazon and Netflix in as many years. That Saturday Night Live hosting gig clearly had his full attention. The Pickup, a heist comedy pairing Murphy with fellow SNL star Pete Davidson, spends its entire 94-minute runtime idling with its door open, waiting for its star to actually jump in. Murphy plays Russell Pierce, an armored truck driver about to celebrate his anniversary with his wife Natalie (Eva Longoria). Their kids are grown and out of the house, and Natalie wants Russell to finally retire from his high-stress job so they can start up that bed and breakfast they've always dreamed of. So in the meantime, Natalie may have to settle for him simply making it to their anniversary dinner on time. He makes this clear when he's paired with Travis Stolly (Pete Davidson), a sloppy if enthusiastic young co-worker, for the first time. But their day's run derails thanks to Zoe (Keke Palmer), a vivacious young woman who Travis has recently met and considers a strong romantic prospect. Zoe has other plans for Travis—and for the money his security service is picking up from an Atlantic City casino. This would make Palmer the runaway train. All of that sounds good, especially to Davidson, who transfers his obvious glee at sharing scenes with Eddie Murphy into his character's somewhat less understandable awe at hanging out with Russell. Davidson also does an admirable job at hiding any disappointment over how zipless The Pickup turns out to be. She wasn't funny attempting self-parody on Only Murders In The Building; she's not funny as a cutesy fiery-Latina stereotype here.) The obvious conclusion is to blame director Tim Story, a prolific and genre-hopping workhorse whose laboring for affability has become a grim trademark. His best movies, produced two decades apart, are Barbershop and The Blackening, both charming ensemble comedies dependent on cast chemistry. When you're starring in a Tim Story movie, you can't assume that spectacle, well-blocked action sequences, or tight pacing will save the day. But Davidson is far less experienced (and seems far more amped), while Palmer does her best to carry her character's shameless sympathy-plea backstory. There's something oddly withholding, meanwhile, about one of the funniest guys of all time resolutely not enlivening a stock older-cranky-guy part. Every 15 minutes or so, Murphy will come briefly to life with an outburst of anger or panic, offering a glimpse of what it might have been like to see him riff more freely with younger folks like Davidson and Palmer, as well as proof that yes, he can still get laughs from something as rote as complaining about back pain or doing a “dorky white guy” voice. These moments are just infrequent enough to feel a little perverse, as if he's waiting for someone to accidentally utter undisclosed magic words before sharing his gift. Maybe Murphy truly believed in this laugh-deficient screenplay and simply wanted to make a grounded contribution to an entertaining heist thriller, in which case he made a bad bet. The Pickup is entertaining on that most basic of slack-jawed levels: It has likable stars doing movie stuff (car chases, elaborate deceptions) that the movie seems to bank on blurring into memories of other, better capers.

Avant Gardner LLC, the operator of an entertainment complex that includes New York's beleaguered Brooklyn Mirage, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Billboard reports and documents confirm. The company, which also runs Great Hall and Kings Hall, had planned to reopen Brooklyn Mirage in May after a remodeling, but the scheduled shows have all been canceled as Avant Gardner struggles to secure the necessary permits to open. Though Great Hall and Kings Hall will stay open during the bankruptcy process, Avant Gardner's lender will now assume possession of the company's assets through a debtor-in-possession financing commitment, and the future of the Mirage is uncertain.

As the planned reopening stalled, Josh Wyatt, who was appointed Avant Gardner's chief executive officer last October, was replaced by the board's non-executive chairman, Gary Richards. He told Billboard, “I believe this Chapter 11 restructuring is the most viable path forward—it will allow us to stabilize Avant Gardner and focus on building for the future.”

It's a scene that comes out of nowhere, and the one people want to talk about after seeing the new “Naked Gun” movie. At the mid-way point in the film, Frank Drebin Jr. (Liam Neeson) and Beth (Pamela Anderson) have fallen in love, setting into motion an ‘80s-style montage following the new couple on a lover's getaway to a winter cabin. At the isolated cabin, a book of spells brings Frank and Beth's cheerfully-made snowman to life. At first, the snowman is part of the couple's silly, intimate games, but eventually becomes a third wheel, resulting in homicidal rage and the love montage descending into something more akin to a horror movie.

Brooks Directs Emma Mackey as Jamie Lee Curtis' Ambitious Niece ‘Shelby Oaks' Trailer: Chris Stuckmann's Ghost Mystery Looks… the Same After $1 Million Reshoot “No offense to other reboots and redos and legacy sequels out there, but a lot of them are so stuck on re-doing the stuff that the original did,'” said Schaffer. “You watch them and are delighted, but it's like empty calories, and when it's done, you barely remember that you saw it because, my theory at least, is they're not really a new movie. That fear of doing a “paint by numbers Mad Libs” of the original was very much on Schaffer's mind when he and co-writers Dan Gregor and Doug Mand reached the mid-point of their story. “We got to the point in our script, we were like, ‘Wow, this love story deserves a montage,'” said Schaffer. The 1988 original love montage is truly a classic — the cheery Herman's Hermit 1964 hit is a smart fit, watching Leslie Nielsen and Priscilla Presley laugh their way through a first date to see “Platoon” is still funny, and who can forget that body condom? “We knew it had to be different than that,” said Schaffer. “And then also there's been 30 years of making fun of montages, whether it's ‘Team America' doing a montage, or whatever, there's not a lot of room left in the montage. Schaffer said he was aware of “Jack Frost,” but had only seen the trailer of the 1998 killer snowman movie. It wasn't a sub-genre (if you can even call it that) he'd been consciously considering spoofing, but one night when he got up at four in the morning to use the bathroom, the snowman scene started to play out in his head. It honestly only changed teeny bits for production reasons, a cabin instead of a house, but it never really changed.” People I really respect, like Andy Sandberg, when he read it for me, he was like, ‘Snowman's the best. “It makes sense once you see the movie, but at one point I did have to threaten to quit.” Schaffer is clear that he felt supported in making the film he wanted to make, but due to the opposition, he pared down the snowman so that if it didn't play, it could be removed from the film without leaving a hole. I tried to let them off the hook easy, and go, ‘That's fine,' but they were like, ‘No, dude, we were wrong. A Paramount Pictures release, “The Naked Gun” is now in theaters.

In a heated post on Truth Social on Monday (Aug. 4), the president compared the two women's politics in an attempt to prove that conservative women are more “hot.” “Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST' ad out there,” he wrote. Though the Euphoria star has not commented on it publicly, a recent piece from BuzzFeed reported that she has been a registered Republican since 2024, when Trump won his second of three presidential runs. The report came shortly after Sweeney made headlines for her controversial American Eagle commercials, in which the actress — who is a white woman with blonde hair and blue eyes — boasted about having both “great jeans” and “great genes” — something that upset many consumers who compared the ad's messaging to Nazi propaganda. Trump, however, is clearly a fan of the campaign. As for Swift, who has opposed his policies numerous times, the twice-impeached POTUS wrote Monday, “Just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift.” “Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can't stand her (HATE! “She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT. Billboard has reached out to Swift's rep for comment. Her first time speaking about politics was to endorse Democratic candidate Phil Bresden for Senate in 2018, shortly after which the president said he liked her music “25% less.” In May, Trump again lobbed insults at Swift, posting out of the blue: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,' she's no longer ‘HOT? It's unclear why, months later, Trump is bringing the Eras Tour headliner back up on his social media platform, or how she's related to the controversy surrounding Sweeney and American Eagle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove Democratic members of the state legislature from their offices and charge them with felonies after they fled the state. “The derelict Democrat House members must return to Texas and be in attendance “For any member who fails to do so, I will invoke Texas Attorney General Opinion No. That same afternoon, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton threatened to have the lawmakers arrested. We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law,” he wrote on X. Abbott added the potential of felony charges to his own ultimatum, writing that Democrats who solicited or accepted donations to help cover fines incurred by their absence may have committed felonies, and “violated bribery laws” Democrats responded with a succinct challenge to the governor: “Come and take it.” Abbott's threat against those who aid the missing Democrats is a barely veiled challenge to Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a billionaire who has announced he will be providing lodging and other logistical support for the group during their time in Chicago. “Donald Trump is trying to cheat the system in Texas, but these Democratic legislators refuse to let it happen without a fight,” Pritzker wrote in a post on X. I'm proud to stand side-by-side with them as they protect their constituents.” Elizabeth Warren on Why Billionaires Are Doing All They Can to Stop Zohran Mamdani Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Wilco, Lucinda Williams Storm Jones Beach at Outlaw Festival “This will have implications, not just in Texas, but for our entire nation and its future,” Hochul said at a press conference Monday, alongside some of the Texas Democrats who fled the state. “The gloves are off, and I say, bring it on.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With two of her three HGTV shows canceled in the last 12 months, Christina Haack is focusing on the future with a trip to France, where she's working with a vineyard to launch her dream business — a new champagne line launching in the fall. On July 30, 2025, the interior designer shared in her Instagram Stories that she was in Los Angeles, waiting for a passport replacement after losing hers. Two days later, on August 1, she was happily in Paris with her beau, business executive Chris Larocca, and her 14-year-old daughter Taylor, whom she shares with first husband and fellow HGTV star Tarek El Moussa. Their trip has included luxury shopping, dining and a trip to the vineyard in Reims — about two hours northwest of Paris — to see the progress being made on her Clé Cachée champagne, which is set to launch in the U.S. on September 29. That night, she shared a photo that Larocca posted in his Stories, of them kissing by the River Seine, with the Eiffel Tower illuminated behind them. On August 2, they were off to the Grand Cru region of France, where she posted a photo of a vineyard and wrote, “Checking on production.” The website for Clé Cachée, which means “hidden key” in French, says, “Inspired by many visits to champagne houses throughout France, Christina has partnered with a vineyard and winemaker nestled amongst the Grand Cru vineyards near Epernay to create her own champagne collection. Grand Cru vineyards are known for producing the highest quality Champagne grapes in all of France.” With Hall staying in Tennessee and her staying in Orange County, California, she said on Jeff Lewis' SiriusXM Radio show of her series, “That's over. In a bigger surprise on July 15, it was revealed that HGTV has also canceled her California-based series, “Christina on the Coast,” after five seasons. The series is one of multiple that have not been renewed by HGTV, including “The Flipping El Moussas,” starring her ex and his second wife, Heather Rae El Moussa. “I do know the fans would love to see it back and all three of us would love to see it back,” she told Us Weekly, noting she and Haack might team up for a second round. “We will definitely throw that idea around if season 2 comes about.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first trailer for Spike Lee's new movie, Highest 2 Lowest, is here. A$AP Rocky stars alongside Denzel Washington, Jeffrey Wright, Ilfenesh Hadera, and Ice Spice in the crime movie, which arrives in theaters on August 15 and comes to Apple TV+ on September 5. Rocky also soundtracked the film. Watch the trailer below. Highest 2 Lowest is a reinterpretation of the Akira Kurosawa classic High and Low. Lee's take involves a music-industry ransom plot that plays out on the streets of New York (and in an apartment modeled after Kurosawa's original). A teaser came out in May ahead of the film's recent premiere at Cannes. A24 and Apple Original Productions produced the movie, which is the feature debut from screenwriter Alan Fox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Margaret Qualley and Jack Antonoff‘s earliest dates included long walks around New York City in places like Washington Square Park and near Electric Lady Studios, where they first met during a rooftop party. “Before we were together, at the beginning, I would always follow Southern girl etiquette,” Qualley told Cosmopolitan. We're always having a conversation; he's like my human diary.” In past relationships, Qualley would attempt to contort herself into someone else's ideal partner. It often left her feeling “lonely because I wasn't with my person, and it's like I was seeking something,” a feeling that dissipated when she found her now-husband. I can't be that for him—he'd see through it. So I just have to be myself … Jack makes me feel safe and comfortable.” Elizabeth Warren on Why Billionaires Are Doing All They Can to Stop Zohran Mamdani Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Wilco, Lucinda Williams Storm Jones Beach at Outlaw Festival Qualley describes falling in love with Antonoff as “the biggest feeling I've ever felt,” adding, “He's been the person I've pictured my whole life. My first crush was Adam Sandler in Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy, and I've been looking for that essence my whole life. Qualley and Antonoff married on Long Beach Island in 2023, with Taylor Swift, Zoë Kravitz, Channing Tatum, Cara Delevingne, Lana Del Rey, and more in attendance. “I've never had that many espresso martinis in my life.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>
