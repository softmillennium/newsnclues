You can feel the greatness, just like with other big clubs. Seven titles in Europe, second only to Real Madrid, that says a lot,‚Äù he added. It's a shame that Milan do not play in Europe, because they are the most trophy-winning club after Real Madrid.‚Äù ‚ÄúI spent 13 years at the biggest club in the world and now I'm arriving at one that in previous years was what Real Madrid is today.‚Äù Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. While Modric is already plying his trade for his new club, AC Milan, Vazquez remains a free agent, even though he has no shortage of suitors either. Earlier in the summer, Vazquez himself was linked with a move to AC Milan, while several Spanish clubs, too, have been linked with the veteran defender. Espanyol, nevertheless, are keen on signing him despite his age and feel this summer could be an ideal opportunity for them to snap him up on a free transfer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Deossa Arrives with Momentum and International Experience Real Betis have officially announced the signing of Colombian midfielder Nelson Deossa, who joins from Rayados de Monterrey on a contract running until 2030. Deossa landed in Seville on Sunday, where he was welcomed by sporting director Manu Fajardo. A product of Atl√©tico Huila, Deossa made his professional debut in 2021. He had stints with Estudiantes de La Plata, Atl√©tico Nacional, and J√∫nior de Barranquilla before moving to Mexico in 2024. With Pachuca, he won the Concacaf Champions Cup and later joined Rayados, where he scored seven goals and provided one assist in 29 official matches. The Betis squad, led by Pellegrini, recently returned from a training camp in England at St. George's Park, and began a new phase of preseason preparations this Monday in Marbella. On Wednesday, they will face Como, featuring former Betis players Jes√∫s Rodr√≠guez and Assane Diao, followed by a clash with M√°laga on Saturday at La Rosaleda. These matches will wrap up Betis' preseason before their league debut. Now under Pellegrini's guidance, Deossa aims to establish himself in the midfield and prove that his top form in Mexican football can translate to Spanish success.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As FIFA's senior manager/accessibility and safeguarding, Linda Mastandrea's purview was no exception. Five of the venues that hosted CWC games this summer and have World Cup matches next year -- Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Hard Rock Stadium, MetLife Stadium, Lincoln Financial Field and Lumen Field -- were part of a pilot effort in which sign language interpreters sat in the stands or in suites with groups of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans. They translated any player introductions, match commentary and stadium announcements those fans would have otherwise missed. FIFA reached out to deaf fans and accessibility advisory groups in the various cities ahead of the CWC matches, then worked with an interpreter services agency to hire local interpreters. Equally, they're looking at audio description for fans with vision issues. ‚ÄúThere is so much happening in the tech universe with OneCourt and other haptic devices,‚Äù Mastandrea said. The experience for people with sensory, visual, auditory issues will continue to improve.‚Äù Mastandrea, who joined FIFA in 2024 on a contract basis through Aug. 2026, is deeply qualified for this role. Mastandrea's work during the last year-plus included site visits to all the stadiums and determining whether accessibility features that FIFA requires were present or needed to be enhanced. She's met with host cities to discuss the accessibility of transit systems, rideshares, hotels, public services and is working internally on making the ticket-buying process as easy as possible.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea right-back Malo Gusto posted a video to his Instagram followers on Sunday, showing the preparation he is doing as the new season approaches. Gusto was brilliant at the Club World Cup, playing a key role in stifling PSG's lethal wide attackers in a dominant final win. READ MORE: Enzo Maresca makes decision on David Datro Fofana's Chelsea future amid transfer interest But he's not stopping there, and wants to be a driving force in helping Chelsea exceed expectations again this season. Another possible interpretation of ‚Äòbigger' is the Champions League, which Chelsea are returning to after a two-year hiatus. Malo Gusto got a chance to shine at right-back last season with Reece James' extended absence. Now, with the signing of Hato, Chelsea have two full backlines that they can field next season, which will allow them to stay competitive on all fronts and avoid fatigue. Jorrel Hato,Marc Cucurella,Reece James,Malo Gusto.How many teams in the world have four fullbacks who can play high and wide, inverted into midfield, or tucked into a back 3?Chelsea's fullback options are very special. Gusto may feel hard done by in relation to minutes this season, as he probably gets into every starting XI in the league, bar Arsenal and maybe Spurs. Unfortunately, if James is back fit and firing, as Chelsea's leader, he will keep Gusto out of the side, and the inverted left-back role that the Brazilian has filled at times will also likely be occupied. But Gusto is determined and won't shy away from the challenge of competing for Enzo Maresca's favour.</p>

You'd better be prepared to pony up when FIFA comes to Vancouver and Toronto next summer for the World Cup, because it's leaving taxpayers with a massive bill.

If you don't see it, please check your junk folder. The next issue of Platformed will soon be in your inbox. Taxpayers may be on the hook for more than a billion dollars. Ontario hasn't been transparent enough with taxpayers to provide those kinds of net cost breakdowns. And even if you don't live in British Columbia or Ontario, your tax dollars are still bankrolling the tournament. It's also shelling out over $104 million to Toronto to offset costs for things like fan festivals and police motorcades for FIFA delegations. All three levels of government are spending money on these soccer games. Most of the provincial money is being spent on provincial services for the games, like stadium renovations in B.C. Here's the real kicker: most British Columbia and Ontario taxpayers don't even want to host the World Cup. Polling from Leger shows that 55 per cent of British Columbians and 56 per cent of Ontarians don't think the soccer games are worth the cost. government's own estimates, the games are going to come at a net cost of up to $145 million for taxpayers. That means the province is going to be losing money on these games. How the money going to these games is being spent should raise eyebrows. FIFA bigwigs are demanding preferential treatment, funded by taxpayers. FIFA's contract with Vancouver demands the ‚ÄúVIP/VVIP,‚Äù treatment from taxpayers, for any ‚Äúindividuals nominated by FIFA.‚Äù Those very and very, very important people will be met at the gate and taken to ‚Äúspecial‚Äù immigration, customs and security screening points. They will have access to exclusive waiting rooms, special luggage collection and even VIP parking, according to the contracts signed with Vancouver and Toronto. In fact, Toronto and Vancouver councils even promised police escorts and road closures for anyone nominated by FIFA. Why would soccer executives need to cruise around Toronto or Vancouver with a police escort on closed streets? And FIFA's ethics record would make a tin-pot dictator green with envy. Dozens of former FIFA executives have been indicted and criminally charged over the years, with fraud, money laundering and corruption. When an international soccer organization has a long track record of corruption and mismanaging its own money, why are we spending more than a billion dollars of our money to host a FIFA tournament? The host cities ‚Äúunconditionally and irrevocably accepts as final and binding any decision by FIFA,‚Äù reads the contract. Vancouver and Toronto's contracts give FIFA control over how taxpayer money is spent on the tournament. Expensive goodies like road closures, fan zones, exclusion bubbles around the stadium and security protocols are all under FIFA's control. If FIFA doesn't like the fan festivals that Vancouver or Toronto put on, it can demand more. If FIFA isn't happy with the VIP suites at the stadium, more luxurious ones are built ‚Äî which is exactly what happened in Vancouver. And the price tag to attend the games freezes out most Canadian families whose taxes are paying for them. Tickets currently start at $2,500 for a single match and go up to $15,975 for a package that includes all the games in either Vancouver or Toronto. Not a dime of taxpayer money should be spent on the World Cup. It's time the Swiss soccer executives to pay for their own motorcades.
