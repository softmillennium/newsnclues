                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The study, published online in Cell on August 4, achieves multiple types of precise DNA manipulations ranging from kilobase to megabase scale in higher organisms, especially plants. However, its broader application has been hindered by three critical limitations: (1) reversible recombination reactions-stemming from the inherent symmetry of Lox sites-can negate desired edits; (2) the tetrameric nature of Cre recombinase complicates engineering efforts, hindering activity optimization; and (3) residual Lox sites after recombination may compromise editing precision. The research team addressed each of these challenges and developed novel methods to advance the state of this technology. First, they built a high-throughput platform for rapid recombination site modification and proposed an asymmetric Lox site design. This led to the development of novel Lox variants that reduce reversible recombination activity by over 10-fold (approaching the background level of negative controls) while retaining high-efficiency forward recombination. They then leveraged their recently developed AiCE (AI-informed Constraints for protein Engineering), model-a protein-directed evolution system integrating general inverse folding models with structural and evolutionary constraints-to develop AiCErec, a recombinase engineering method. This approach enabled precise optimization of Cre's multimerization interface, yielding an engineered variant with a recombination efficiency 3.5 times that of wild-type Cre. Lastly, they designed and refined a scarless editing strategy for recombinases. By harnessing the high editing efficiency of prime editors, they developed Re-pegRNA, a method that uses specifically designed pegRNAs to perform re-prime editing on residual Lox sites, precisely replacing them with the original genomic sequence, thereby ensuring seamless genome modifications. These platforms allow flexible programming of insertion positions and orientations for different Lox sites, enabling precise, scarless manipulation of DNA fragments ranging from kilobase to megabase scale in both plant and animal cells. As a proof of concept, the researchers used this technology to create herbicide-resistant rice germplasm with a 315-kb precise inversion, showcasing its transformative potential for genetic engineering and crop improvement. This pioneering work not only overcomes the historical limitations of the Cre-Lox system but also opens new avenues for precise genome engineering in a variety of organisms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why do young children often miss the emotions behind adult expressions? A pioneering study led by researcher Xie Wanze from Peking University's School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, in collaboration with professor Seth Pollak from the University of Wisconsin, reveals that the answer lies in a cognitive shift. Published in Nature Communications, their research shows how children aged 5-10 transition from merely "seeing" facial expressions to deeply understanding emotions, relying less on instinct and more on learned insight. Interpreting emotions is crucial for social bonds, yet children often struggle to decode adult feelings. This process involves perceiving facial features and applying conceptual knowledge to grasp emotional meaning. As children grow, their ability to navigate complex social environments depends on a refined understanding of emotions. The study explored how children process emotions through three interconnected experiments, spanning neural activity, conceptual understanding, and behavior. In the first experiment on perception, researchers used EEG frequency tagging to show that even five-year-old children could automatically differentiate between four core facial expressions - happiness, anger, fear, and sadness - through neural responses localized in the temporo-occipital region. This perceptual ability appeared stable across different age groups. The second experiment examined conceptual knowledge through a word-similarity task, revealing that older children had more nuanced emotional associations, such as linking the word "crying" to multiple emotions, an indication of developing emotional complexity. Younger participants tended to categorize expressions in broad terms of positive versus negative. At the same time, older children displayed a more refined understanding by distinguishing between specific negative emotions like anger and fear. To integrate these findings, the team used Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) alongside Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to trace the cognitive dynamics underlying emotion understanding. The results revealed a distinct developmental shift: younger children rely more heavily on perceptual cues, while older children increasingly depend on conceptual knowledge. This progression from "seeing faces" to "understanding feelings" underscores how emotional development is shaped by experience, learning, and growing cognitive sophistication throughout childhood. This research highlights the dynamic interplay between perception and conceptual knowledge in children's emotional development, offering a foundation for designing age-appropriate educational and therapeutic strategies to enhance social-emotional skills. Conceptual knowledge increasingly supports emotion understanding as perceptual contribution declines with age.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>McGill University researchers have developed and are licensing a digital tool to help safely reduce patients' use of medications that may be unnecessary or even harmful to them. When clinicians review a patient's file, MedSafer flags potentially inappropriate medications. In a new clinical trial, the software helped deprescribe such medications in 36 per cent of long-term care residents, nearly triple as many as when reviews were done without the tool. I've seen patients go from barely responsive to having conversations again after stopping a sedating medication." Nearly two thirds of Canadian seniors take five or more medications a day, and the number is significantly higher in long-term care, she added. Medications are typically reviewed every three months in long-term care homes, but the scholars say there's no standard approach to deprescribing. MedSafer works as a checklist for clinicians. It scans a resident's medication list alongside their health conditions, flags drugs that may no longer be appropriate and provides guidance on how to stop some medications or for safer alternatives. The software was co-developed by McDonald and Dr. Todd Lee, Associate Professor in McGill's Department of Medicine and Scientist at The Institute . The trial involved 725 residents in five long-term care homes in New Brunswick who were taking an average of 10 medications each. Medications often accumulate over time and are sometimes prescribed to counteract the side effects of other drugs, a pattern known as a "prescribing cascade." "Some medications can increase the risk of falls, confusion and hospitalizations," said Lee. The researchers' goal is to see MedSafer integrated into primary care, so that overmedication can be addressed before patients enter long-term care. "This should be the new standard of care for older adults," McDonald said. "No one should be on a medication that's doing more harm than good." McDonald, E. G., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new editorial published in Comprehensive Physiology underscores the critical importance of understanding heart-lung interactions in pulmonary vascular disease (PVD). Tim Lahm, MD, a pulmonologist and researcher at National Jewish Health, along with a team of esteemed colleagues from institutions across the country, urges the scientific community to confront the major knowledge gaps that hinder progress in improving patient outcomes. The editorial, titled "Towards a Better Understanding of Heart-Lung Interactions in Pulmonary Vascular Disease," serves as a call for papers for an upcoming special issue of Comprehensive Physiology dedicated to this topic. We've moved beyond the idea that pulmonary hypertension is simply a lung disease. The future of patient care lies in unraveling these cardiopulmonary dynamics." Dr. Tim Lahm, MD, pulmonologist and researcher at National Jewish Health Drawing from a wide range of recent research, the editorial explores how the heart and lungs function as a tightly coupled unit - what the authors call a "right atrium-right ventricle-lung vascular unit." The editorial highlights growing evidence that pulmonary hypertension, traditionally viewed as a lung-centric disorder, is actually a systemic disease marked by two-way connections among multiple organs. The authors call for an expansion of research to explore novel signaling pathways, mechanical stressors and even emerging model systems - such as heart- and lung-on-a-chip technologies and computational approaches - that can simulate real-world cardiopulmonary conditions with greater precision. The authors issue a call for papers for basic, translational and clinical research exploring these heart-lung interactions in PVD.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Can simple words like "and" or "then" in online reviews help health care providers learn about their patients' experiences? New research shows they can, with a new analysis showing that the most common theme in negative reviews of health care facilities involved communication and administrative issues, while complimentary reviews focused on reassuring and gratifying interactions with clinicians and staff. This was uncovered by an analysis of the specific words and terms used in online reviews, which was then used to find correlations with positive or negative reviews. Because so many are guided in their choices by online reviews of many different industries and products, the researchers view online reviews as an untapped resource for discovering true patient sentiments. The current ways in which health care facilities measure the patient experience and then take action often takes a lot of time, creating a system that lags between the actual encounter and improvements. If the real-time data from online reviews could be incorporated into tools that are easily viewed by health systems and their providers, they could make almost immediate changes for more positive experiences." Anish Agarwal, MD, MPH, senior author, deputy director of the Center for Insights to Outcomes and assistant professor of Emergency Medicine The researchers analyzed data from more than a million Yelp reviews spanning seven years (2017 through 2023) of almost 139,000 health care facilities across the United States. Using a data analysis tool called the Differential Language Analysis ToolKit (DLATK), they specifically looked at 1- and 2-star (negative) reviews, as well as 4- and 5-star (positive) reviews. Payment issues and poor treatment were most strongly tied to negative reviews, almost equally. Communication was a very common theme among the words the researchers determined to be correlated to negative reviews. "Told," "Said," "Call," and "Asked" were among the top words associated with bad reviews. Previous work by Agarwal and his colleagues had also highlighted "told" as the most common term in negative online hospital reviews. Phone conversations (and the hold times associated with them) were common negative themes, along with feelings of unfair payment experiences and perception of poor medical treatment, although the latter was not as common as the researchers believed it would be, Agarwal said. More than 50 percent of the analyzed reviews were 4- or 5-stars, with "and" as the top term associated with those reviews by a good margin, followed by "great." "Friendly," "helpful," and "kind," were all top terms. According to the analysis, the ability of staff to relieve patients' anxiety was also a top theme uncovered, resulting in "nervous" and "scared" being terms that were actually associated with positive reviews. "We believe these are systemic issues rather than isolated complaints," said first author Neil Sehgal, ME, an associate fellow in the Penn Leonard Davis Institute for Health Economics. "We're interested in understanding how specific facility characteristics, such as size, ownership, or patient volume, might shape patient sentiment and communication challenges." Agarwal is particularly interested in understanding more about the health care facilities who consistently score well. "I'd love to see where and which hospitals consistently knock this out of the park and, despite the last five to ten years, continue to provide high-quality and highly well-regarded care," Agarwal said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Understanding exactly how psychedelics promote new connections in the brain is critical to developing targeted, non-hallucinogenic therapeutics that can treat neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. To achieve this, researchers are mapping the biochemical pathways involved in both neuroplasticity and hallucinations. In new research led by the University of California, Davis, researchers found that non-hallucinogenic versions of psychedelic drugs promote neuroplasticity through the same biochemical pathway as psychedelics. However, unlike psychedelics, they don't activate genes long thought to be key players in that process. The prevailing hypothesis in the field was that psychedelics promote neuroplasticity by causing this big burst of glutamate in the brain, which then turns on intermediate early genes. We now know that non-hallucinogenic compounds like TBG can promote neuroplasticity without inducing a glutamate burst or immediate early gene activation." Using pharmacological and genetic tools in rodents, the team found that both TBG and 5-MeO-DMT promoted cortical neuroplasticity by activating the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A). Both drugs then induced the downstream activation of the same receptors and proteins, including TrkB, mTOR and AMPA. Full agonists turn on the faucet all the way, allowing for a full flow of water, while partial agonists only allow for drips and limited streams. "Partial agonists only turn on the receptor part way and that seems to be sufficient to turn on plasticity." The study addressed an open question in psychedelic science. While the activation of 5-HT2A receptors by psychedelics is known to promote neuroplasticity, the link between this and psychedelics' sustained antidepressant effects was unclear. They then used lasers to erase those spines. "When we erased those spines, the antidepressant effect went away," Olson said. Previously, this kind of experiment was conducted with ketamine to demonstrate that its sustained antidepressant-like properties required the growth of these dendritic spines. "And we find that cortical neuroplasticity is at least responsible for some of the compound's antidepressant-like effects." While 5-MeO-DMT and TBG boasted similarities in their effects on neuroplasticity, there were critical differences. Unlike 5-MeO-DMT, TBG didn't promote bursts of glutamate or turn on immediate early genes - genes long thought to be critical for the neuroplasticity-promoting effects of psychedelics. "It was kind of shocking that TBG promoted plasticity, but the glutamate burst and immediate early genes were not required," Olson said. The team used a combination of whole brain imaging and single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile gene expression patterns following treatment with 5-MeO-DMT and TBG. "What we found is that glutamate bursts and immediate early gene expression are probably more related to the hallucinogenic properties of psychedelics rather than their plasticity-promoting effects." "Science is full of surprises," said Gray. "There is still so much we don't know about how psychedelics impact the brain, and it feels like we learn something new every day."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By targeting a key viral weakness, this breakthrough could lead to stronger, longer-lasting treatments—not just for the flu, but potentially for other viruses as well. In a potential game-changer for how we treat the flu, scientists have unveiled a new drug pairing that outperforms Tamiflu—the most widely used anti-influenza medication—against even the deadliest flu strains, including bird(avian) and swine flu. One of them is Theobromine, a compound found in chocolate. In a study recently published in PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, led by Prof. Isaiah (Shy) Arkin, have developed a novel combination therapy that targets a key weakness in the influenza virus: its ion channel, a microscopic gate the virus uses to replicate and spread. Their study, conducted at Israel's new Barry Skolnick Biosafety Level 3 facility, tested this combo—Theobromine and a lesser-known compound called Arainosine—against a broad range of flu viruses. In both cell cultures and animal trials, the treatment dramatically outperformed Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), especially against drug-resistant strains. "We're not just offering a better flu drug," said Prof. Arkin. "We're introducing a new way to target viruses—one that may help us prepare for future pandemics." The stakes are high: Influenza continues to sweep the globe each year, with unpredictable mutations that challenge vaccines and existing drugs. Past pandemics—like the 2009 swine flu—have inflicted even deeper global costs, and the cost of future pandemics was estimated to rise even further up to $4.4 trillion. Meanwhile, outbreaks of avian flu have devastated poultry industries and sparked fears of cross-species transmission to humans. Just one recent outbreak in the U.S. led to the loss of 40 million birds and billions in economic damage. Current flu treatments, like Tamiflu, are losing ground as the virus adapts. Most drugs in use target a viral protein that mutates frequently, rendering treatments less effective over time. That's where Arkin's team saw an opening. But the new Theobromine-Arainosine combo sidesteps this resistance, even neutralizing hard-to-treat strains. The team discovered the combo by scanning a library of repurposed compounds—many originally developed for other diseases—and testing their effects on both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant versions of the virus. Because many viruses—including coronaviruses and others—also rely on ion channels, this new approach could form the basis of future antiviral strategies. The next steps include human clinical trials, but the early results offer hope not just for a better flu treatment, but for a smarter way to fight viral disease in general. A bacteria-based search for drugs against avian and swine flu yields a potent and resistance-resilient channel blocker.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An important finding of the meta-analysis is that its conclusions applied across a broad range of populations, including African, Asian, European, and Hispanic ethnic groups. One limitation of the analysis is that the decrease in risk, though apparent, did not reach a level of statistical significance for Hispanic people or mixed ethnic groups. They say further investigation, particularly for these populations, is warranted. It is characterized by an emphasis on unprocessed foods, fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and lean sources of protein. It is in many ways not very different from the Mediterranean diet. Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, a preventive cardiology dietitian and heart health expert at Entirely Nourished, not involved in this research, explained what the AHEI diet is: “The AHEI (Alternative Healthy Eating Index) diet is a research-based scoring system developed to assess diet quality based on how well it aligns with dietary patterns that have been shown to lower chronic disease risk. It encourages high consumption of fiber-dense foods like vegetables, whole fruits excluding juice, whole grains, nuts, legumes; healthy fats like polyunsaturated fats, and lean proteins, specifically fish and poultry. All three diets share some underlying concepts, said Jason Ng, MD, BA, who teaches endocrinology and metabolism in the Department of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. The foods people consume are a major driver of diabetes, said Ng. When the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to manage blood sugars, you develop [type 2 diabetes].” “The DASH diet has a slightly higher emphasis on sodium intake that may indirectly worsen insulin resistance,” Ng hypothesized, “so an emphasis on low sodium may indirectly help insulin sensitivity and, thus, improve [type 2 diabetes].” “For example,” she explained, “[the DASH diet] is abundant in both potassium and magnesium that not only supports healthy blood pressure but also plays a key role in glucose metabolism, enhancing insulin sensitivity, facilitating cellular glucose uptake, and reducing systemic inflammation, creating a metabolic environment less prone to diabetes development.” He noted that “although reversing [type 2 diabetes] is a complex process, any diet that emphasizes healthy eating, which all of these do, can only help reduce the progression of [type 2 diabetes] and obtain better sugar control and improved insulin sensitivity.” In this episode of our podcast, Feature Editor Maria Cohut discusses matters related to diet and heart health with Dr. Oyinlola Oyebode from Queen… There is evidence that following a low-calorie diet can place type 2 diabetes into long-term remission.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from Tufts University and elsewhere have revealed that these B vitamins influence a vast spectrum of human health and disease, including cognitive function, cardiovascular health, gastric bypass recovery, neural tube defects, and even cancer. One carbon metabolism is a series of pathways that allow for the transfer of single-carbon units to cells for essential processes such as DNA synthesis, amino acid metabolism, and more. It's their role in all these crucial biological functions that make the B vitamins so important-and so challenging to tease out how they contribute positively and, perhaps negatively, to human health. Mason and two additional researchers who spent their careers studying one or more of the B vitamins explain what we currently know about how the five of the most prominently researched B vitamins impact or improve cognitive as well as cardiovascular health. One of the most active areas for B vitamin research is cognitive health. However, Mason says, while many elderly people may have B12 levels that are in the 'low to normal' range, they are simultaneously developing neurological deficits linked to vitamin B12 deficiency. The contribution of vitamin B12 deficiency to cognitive decline and the vascular disease that results in many cases of dementia is under-diagnosed and under-reported." "Age-related cognitive decline is not just Alzheimer's," says Rosenberg. "We've lumped together many kinds of brain dysfunction under one name. And in doing so, we've overlooked how critical blood vessels-and by extension, nutrition-are to preserving brain function." Yet Rosenberg says cerebrovascular disease and small vessel disease, which in some cases are connected to B vitamin deficiency, is more prevalent with cognitive decline and dementia than the buildup of harmful proteins in the brain, which has been the focus of so much research and drug development to treat Alzheimer's disease. Treating people with drugs meant to address the protein buildup will not work if the cause of dementia symptoms is a B12 deficiency. Testing to identify whether cognitive decline and dementia symptoms may be caused by a B12 deficiency is therefore imperative, he says. "B12 tests measure all B12 in your system, even though approximately 80% is inactive," says Paul Jacques, senior scientist at the HNRCA and professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy. If only homocysteine levels are elevated, a folate deficiency may be the problem. If both MMA and homocysteine are high, a B12 deficiency is the likely culprit. If a patient presents with neurological issues or signs of dementia, conducting all three tests will narrow down if a B vitamin deficiency is involved-and which B vitamin it is. "Unlike changes that we are unable to see in patients being given expensive anti-amyloid antibody drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease, there is actually evidence that fairly early in the course of cognitive decline we can slow the process if the underlying cause is elevated homocysteine or B12-related deficiency," says Rosenberg. "It's my recommendation that patients, with or without anemia, should be screened for elevated homocysteine or B12 deficiency because that may be one of the reversible factors in their cognitive decline." Two decades ago, studies like the Framingham Heart Study showed that elevated homocysteine predicted brain atrophy and a higher risk of dementia. More recently, trials such as VITACOG and FACT have shown that B vitamin supplementation can slow brain shrinkage and improve cognitive performance in those at risk. "There is an enormous amount of education needed around this issue," Rosenberg says. "We hope to convince cardiologists, neurologists, and internists to measure B12 and homocysteine levels as part of the evaluation of cognitive impairment. Even the modest effects from vitamins that cost pennies a day can be very meaningful in those who will benefit, especially when you compare vitamin supplementation to costly drugs that are getting much more attention yet may have the same or even less benefit." "The risk of dementia and late-stage Alzheimer's begins to increase when one is 75 years old or older, but evidence suggests that some of the pathological changes associated with dementia and Alzheimer's may start to develop 20+ years before clinical symptoms and diagnosis occurs," says Jacques. "This study should give us a good handle on whether B12 is related to cognitive decline and dementia. If so, hopefully we can identify a simple, inexpensive intervention that could be started years in advance and before real damage occurs." "Scientists observed that people with low B12 and high folic acid concentrations tended to have cognitive issues," Jacques says. More recent research suggested that it wasn't total B12 concentrations that folic acid might be affecting, but perhaps just one component, holoTC, which is the form of vitamin B12 that is crucial for transporting and using B12 in cells and is considered a potentially better indicator of vitamin B12 status. Jacques and colleagues are conducting two studies to tease apart the issues involved. B vitamins have also stirred excitement among researchers because of their possible role in heart disease and stroke prevention, but thus far their utility as a clinical treatment remains limited. Scientists discovered in the early 2000s that riboflavin (B2) could decrease blood pressure very effectively. It is believed that riboflavin improves a biochemical reaction mediated by a gene called MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) that helps the body use folate. Vitamins B6, B12, and folate help the body rid itself of homocysteine, which in overabundance had been linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, as well as dementia. However, a number of clinical trials in the 1980s showed that B6, B12, and folate supplementation didn't decrease heart attacks, but did slightly lower the risk of strokes. "But it has to be taken in such large doses that it often causes very uncomfortable flushing, like hot flashes," says Mason. "People often can't tolerate taking it, and other drug options are available that lower blood LDL that do not have such unpleasant side effects." Perhaps most promising for the future is the role vitamin B6 may play in curbing inflammation, which has been identified as an underlying feature of many chronic diseases, from heart disease to diabetes to arthritis to dementia. "Again, we are talking about giving B vitamins at an appropriate pharmaceutical level under the care of a clinician," cautions Mason. He sees this research as an area to watch in the years ahead.
