                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Greg Abbott says he will begin trying to remove Democratic lawmakers from office Monday if they don't return after dozens of them left the state in a last-resort attempt to block redrawn U.S. House maps that President Donald Trump wants before the 2026 midterm elections. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Democrats on Monday prevented their state's House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump to shore up Republicans' 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters. Greg Abbott has made threats about removing some members of the opposition from their seats. The Republican-dominated House issued civil arrest warrants intended to compel the return of absent members, but it was not immediately clearly whether those can or will be enforced beyond Texas borders. “If you continue to go down this road, there will be consequences,” he said. The Democratic revolt and Abbott's threats ratcheted up a widening fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but expanded to include Democratic governors who have floated the possibility of rushing to redraw their own state maps in retaliation, even if their options are limited. That would bolster his party's chances of preserving its slim U.S. House majority, as Republicans were unable to do in the 2018 midterms during Trump's first presidency. Speaking Monday on Fox News, Abbott essentially admitted to the partisan power play, noting that the U.S. Supreme Court has determined “there is nothing illegal” about shaping districts to a majority party's advantage. He even openly acknowledged it as “gerrymandering” before correcting himself to say Texas is “drawing lines.” Greg Abbott speaks during a roundtable discussion with President Donald Trump, first responders and local officials at Hill Country Youth Event Center in Kerrville, Texas, during a tour to observe flood damage, Friday, July 11, 2025. More than 1,800 miles away from Austin, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul appeared with Texas Democrats and argued that their cause should be national. “We're not going to tolerate our democracy being stolen in a modern-day stagecoach heist by bunch of law breaking cowboys,” Hochul said Monday, flanked by several of the lawmakers who left Texas. “If Republicans are willing to rewrite rules to give themselves an advantage, then they're leaving us with no choice: We must do the same. State Reps. Armando Walle, left, and Ana Hernandez, both Democrats from Houston, speak during a news conference at the National Conference of State Legislatures Legislative Summit, Monday, Aug. 4, 2025, in Boston. Abbott insisted ahead of the scheduled session that lawmakers have “absconded” in violation of their sworn duties to the state. “Texans don't run from a fight,” he said. “He has no legal mechanism,” said Texas Rep. Jolanda Jones, one of the lawmakers who was in New York on Monday. As for his threat to remove the lawmakers, Abbott cited a nonbinding legal opinion issued by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton amid an partisan quorum dispute in 2021. Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, said on X that Democrats who “try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately.” Texas House Democrats join Illinois Governor JB Pritzker speaks about the Texas Republican plans to redraw the House map during a press conference at the Democratic Party of DuPage County office in Carol Stream, IL on Sunday, Aug. 3, 2025. The lawmakers who left declined to say how long they will hold out. “The magic of a quorum break is you never telegraph the how long or what you're going to do,” said Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, who has served in the Legislature since 2001. Texas House Democratic Caucus leader Gene Wu said his members “will do whatever it takes” but added, “What that looks like, we don't know.” Legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, including in 2021 when many of the same Texas House Democrats left the state for 38 days to protest new voting restrictions. Once they returned, Republicans still passed that measure. Lawmakers cannot pass bills in the 150-member Texas House without at least two-thirds of them present. The governor, meanwhile, continues to make unsubstantiated claims that some lawmakers have committed felonies by soliciting money to pay for fines they could face for leaving the state to deny a quorum. The lack of a quorum will delay votes on disaster assistance and new warning systems in the wake of last month's catastrophic floods in Texas that killed at least 136 people. Democrats had called for votes on the flooding response before taking up redistricting and have criticized Republicans for not doing so. On Fox, Abbott attempted to turn that issue back on Democrats, suggesting their efforts to break a quorum would become the reason for a delayed flood response. Beyond Texas, some Democrats wants to leverage the fight. JB Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential contender and outspoken Trump critic, welcomed Texas Democrats on Sunday after having been in quiet talks with them for weeks. “This is not just rigging the system in Texas,” Pritzker said Sunday night.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? ﻿The Court recently saved part of the Voting Rights Act. In Milligan, two of the Republican justices — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh — voted with the Court's Democratic minority to strike down Alabama's racially gerrymandered congressional maps, ordering the state to redraw those maps to include an additional district with a Black majority. And the Court's Republican majority is normally hostile to lawsuits challenging gerrymanders of any kind. Most notably, in Rucho v. Common Cause (2019), the Republican justices held that federal courts may not hear suits challenging partisan gerrymanders. Among other things, Rucho enables tactics like Texas Republicans' current plans to redraw that state's congressional maps to maximize GOP power in Congress. So why did two Republican justices break with their previous skepticism of gerrymandering suits in the Milligan case? The new order, in a case known as Louisiana v. Callais, suggests that the Court's decision in Milligan was merely a minor detour, and that Roberts and Kavanaugh's votes in Milligan were largely driven by unwise legal decisions by Alabama's lawyers. The Callais order, in other words, doesn't simply suggest that Milligan was a one-off decision that is unlikely to be repeated. It also suggests that the Court's Republican majority will resume its laissez-faire approach to gerrymandering, just as the redistricting wars appear to be heating up. Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of lawsuits alleging that a legislative map is illegally gerrymandered. Partisan gerrymandering suits claim that a map was drawn to maximize one major political party's power at the expense of the other. Racial gerrymandering suits, meanwhile, allege that a state's legislative maps improperly dilute the voting power of voters of a particular race. Prior to Rucho, the Court imposed minimal — but not entirely nonexistent — limits on partisan gerrymandering. It has historically been more aggressive in policing racial gerrymanders. Notably, however, no five justices agreed to a single legal standard that would allow courts to determine which maps are illegal partisan gerrymanders in Davis. A few years later, in Alexander v. NAACP (2024), those justices went even further, declaring that “as far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, a legislature may pursue partisan ends when it engages in redistricting.” Though Davis's limits on partisan gerrymandering were always fuzzy, it is likely that this ambiguity deterred at least some states from enacting extreme gerrymanders that might have caused the courts to intervene. At the very least, Rucho changed how states litigate gerrymandering suits. Before Rucho, states accused of gerrymandering would often try to offer another explanation for why their maps benefited one party or the other. Now, they will openly state in their briefs that they drew maps for partisan reasons — confident that federal judges will do nothing, despite these confessions. Historically, however, the Court has imposed more concrete limits on racial gerrymanders. This is because, in such a state, the white majority can wield its near-unanimous support for Republicans to cut Black voters (and Democrats) out of power altogether. In a different state, where both Black and white voters sometimes vote for either party, Gingles tells courts to stay out of redistricting. Black voters, after all, are United States citizens who have as much of a right to choose their leaders as anyone else. So, if they choose to be represented by a white Republican in a free and fair election, that's their choice and the courts should honor it. Because Gingles only kicks in when an electorate's racial demographics closely match its partisan voting patterns, it places some practical limits on both partisan and racial gerrymandering. In Milligan, for example, Alabama was not able to draw maps that maximized Republican voting power because doing so required the state to dilute Black voting power. So, even though Rucho prevents lawsuits that challenge partisan gerrymandering directly, Gingles sometimes allows suits which target it indirectly by alleging that a partisan gerrymander is also an impermissible racial gerrymander. But now the Court is signaling that it is likely to overrule Gingles and abolish suits alleging that racial gerrymanders violate the Voting Rights Act altogether. Then, at the end of June, the Court issued a brief order announcing that it would hold an unusual second oral argument in Callais, and that it would seek additional briefing from the parties in this case. On Friday, the Court issued a new order laying out what these parties should address in those briefs. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Republican justices neutralized a different provision of the Voting Rights Act, which required states with a history of racist election practices to “preclear” new election laws with federal officials before they take effect. The Court's Republican majority labeled this provision “strong medicine” that could be justified to combat the kind of widespread racial voting discrimination that existed during Jim Crow. Although Kavanaugh joined nearly all of the majority opinion in Milligan, he also wrote a separate opinion indicating that he wanted to extend Shelby County to gerrymandering cases in a future ruling. “Even if Congress in 1982 could constitutionally authorize race-based redistricting under [the Voting Rights Act] for some period of time,” Kavanaugh wrote, “the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.” Gingles also suggests that Voting Rights Act suits challenging racial gerrymanders should eventually cease to exist. If the electorate ceases to be racially polarized — something that appears to be slowly happening — then Gingles plaintiffs will no longer be able to win cases, and the federal judiciary's role in redistricting will diminish. Read in the context of Kavanaugh's Milligan opinion, in other words, the new Callais order suggests that a majority of the justices have decided the Voting Rights Act's safeguards against racial gerrymandering have reached their expiration date, and they are looking for arguments to justify striking them down. It now looks like Milligan was Gingles's last gasp. The justice has one half of a really good idea. Senate Republicans are taking an enormous risk with the federal bench right now. The Black civil rights movement's greatest legal achievement is now on a Republican Supreme Court's chopping block.</p>

Texas House Democrats spoke during a news conference in Chicago after fleeing the state to avoid voting on a redistricting proposal. JB Pritzker showed support for the move and called them "courageous." JB Pritzker is rolling out the red carpet for Democratic state lawmakers who fled Texas as they push back against a move by President Donald Trump to add five Republican-controlled congressional seats in their state. Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Rep. Gene Wu spoke during a news conference in Chicago after Texas Democrats fled the state to avoid voting on a redistricting proposal. J.B. Pritzker, left, called Wu and the other Texas lawmakers "courageous." But veteran Republican strategist Matt Whitlock argued that the decision by most of the Democratic lawmakers to head to Illinois - with a few others decamping in two other blue states, New York and Massachusetts - was "cartoonishly dumb." Tom Bevan, the RealClearPolitics co-founder and president, wrote on X, "The idea that Texas Democrats would flee to Illinois, a state where Dems have abused gerrymandering to comical levels, is perfection." "To protest ‘partisan gerrymandering' Texas Democrats are fleeing to…Illinois," Republican Missouri Senator Eric Scmitt wrote on X. Pritzker, the two-term Illinois governor who is seen as a potential 2028 Democratic Party White House hopeful, has criticized Trump and Republicans for "cheating" as they push for rare mid-decade congressional redistricting. "Texas Democrats were left with no choice but to leave their home state to block a vote from taking place and protect their constituents. This is a righteous act of courage," the governor claimed. Texas House Democrats join Illinois Governor JB Pritzker speaks about the Texas Republican plans to redraw the House map during a press conference at the Democratic Party of DuPage County office in Carol Stream, IL on Sunday, Aug. 3, 2025. But Republicans point to the move four years ago by Pritzker and Illinois Democrats to eliminate two Republican congressional seats in the state, to help bolster the party. Illinois, which lost a seat in Congress due to population changes in the last census, went from 13 Democrats and 5 Republicans to 14 Democrats and 3 Republicans in their congressional delegation. Greg Abbott threatened them with arrest upon their return to Texas. Trump and his political team are aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House, when Democrats stormed back to grab the House majority in the 2018 midterms. "Just a simple redrawing, we pick up five seats." Democrats control just 12 of the state's 38 congressional districts, with a blue-leaning seat vacant after the death in March of Rep. Sylvester Turner. The GOP plan relocates Democratic voters from competitive seats into nearby GOP-leaning districts, and moves Republican voters into neighboring districts the Democrats currently control. Dan Patrick, both Trump allies, said they needed to redistrict because of constitutional concerns raised by the Justice Department over a handful of minority-dominated districts. Democrats are slamming Trump and Texas Republicans for what they describe as a power grab, and vowing to take legal action to prevent any shift in the current congressional maps. "Two can play this game," California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on social media recently. Gavin Newsom of California is considering launching a redistricting push in his blue state to counter Republican efforts underway in red-state Texas. The next day, after a meeting, Democrats in California's congressional delegation said they were on board with an ambitious plan to try and gain at least five seats through redistricting. Democrats currently control 43 of the Golden State's 52 congressional districts. But it won't be easy to enact the change, because in California, congressional maps are drawn by an independent commission that is not supposed to let partisanship influence their work. Democrats in other heavily populated blue states—including Illinois, New York, and New Jersey, are also considering making changes to their maps, but have redistricting limits enshrined in their state constitutions. Meanwhile, Ohio is required by law to redistrict this year, and a redrawing of the maps in the red-leaning state could provide the GOP with up to three more congressional seats. And Republicans are also mulling mid-decade redistricting that might give the GOP a couple of more House seats in red states such as Florida, Missouri, and Indiana.

Cincinnati told Fox News Digital that the viral July 26 downtown beatdown that gripped the nation does not define their city, though some say violent crime is an issue. CINCINNATI – Cincinnati residents say that the viral July 26 downtown beatdown that gripped the nation does not define their city, though some say violent crime is an issue. "I don't think it's accurate," Josh Pels, a downtown bartender, told Fox News Digital. "I would say the crime and violent crime in particular has gone up, I would say, over the course of the last six months for sure. [The Over-the-Rhine area] usually has it worse than we have it down here, but there's definitely been an uptick in violent crime." In the video, a group of people can be seen pummeling two victims, one of whom ended up with "very bad brain trauma." The Cincinnati beatdown victim, known only as Holly, said she suffered brain trauma during the fight. Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge said in a Friday press conference that there are a total of six victims. The city's fugitive task force is searching for the two suspects who are still at large. Corey Mitchell is also a Cincinnati resident. "So that was just an action-reaction type of thing," he said. They could put it up in the news and seem like it's a prejudiced place or something like that. Corey Mitchell is a Cincinnati resident who says the viral beatdown doesn't represent the city. He said Cincinnati has "probably less fights than other cities," and that social media amplified the beating to a level that put the city in the spotlight. He also said that while brutal, the victim who he said slapped a man in the crowd and kicked off the beatdown, should have expected repercussions. Cincinnati resident Robert Brown told Fox News Digital that every city has fights like the one in Cincinnati. "At the same time, he still shouldn't have smacked him. A fourth resident described her immediate reaction after seeing the fight. "I was busy surfing through the internet, making calls, trying to figure out there's gotta be a backstory behind this. Blair said she hopes the brawl doesn't spiral into something even more serious. "And in the back of my mind I wonder, okay, what's gonna happen next? Can we sit down and talk about the situation? Is it gonna spring into something else?" The corner of Fourth and Elm Street outside LoVe, a local nightclub, where the beating took place, as seen on July 28, 2025 in Cincinnati. In a Friday press conference, Mayor Aftab Pureval warned that everyone seen fighting will face consequences, vowing "further investigation, further charges and further arrests for every single person involved." Montianez Merriweather, 34, and Dekyra Vernon, 24, were arrested Tuesday night. Merriweather is being held on a $500,000 bond, while Vernon is being held on a $200,000 bond. They remain in jail as of Monday morning. Montianez Merriweather and Dekyra Vernon have been arrested in connection to a fight in Cincinnati that gained national attention over the weekend. Jermaine Matthews, 39, was released from Hamilton County Jail on Friday after paying a combined $270,000 bond. He was hit with five charges stemming from the beatdown, two counts of assault, two counts of felony assault and aggravated riot for his alleged participation in the brutal brawl. A fourth suspect was arrested on Friday night. Dominique Kittle faces charges of aggravated riot and misdemeanor assault. He is being held on a $150,000 bond. His attorney said he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. Fox News' Rachel Wolf contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Greg Abbott says he will begin trying to remove Democratic lawmakers from office Monday if they don't return after dozens of them left the state in a last-resort attempt to block redrawn U.S. House maps that President Donald Trump wants before the 2026 midterm elections. Greg Abbott says he will begin trying to remove Democratic lawmakers from office Monday if they do not return after dozens of them left the state in an attempt to block the adoption of redrawn U.S. House maps sought by President Donald Trump. Some of the lawmakers, including those who left Sunday for Illinois or New York, clapped back, accusing Abbott of using “smoke and mirrors” to make threats that go beyond his legal authority. The revolt by Democrats in the state House and Abbott's threat ratcheted up a widening fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but expanded to include Democratic governors who have floated the possibility of rushing to redraw their own state maps in retaliation. Greg Abbott speaks during a roundtable discussion with President Donald Trump, first responders and local officials at Hill Country Youth Event Center in Kerrville, Texas, during a tour to observe flood damage, Friday, July 11, 2025. “We're not going to tolerate our democracy being stolen in a modern-day stagecoach heist by bunch of law breaking cowboys,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday, flanked by several of the lawmakers who fled. “If Republicans are willing to rewrite rules to give themselves an advantage, then they're leaving us with no choice: We must do the same. That would bolster his party's chances of preserving its slim U.S. House majority. Republicans currently hold 25 of the state's 38 seats. Texas House Democrats join Illinois Governor JB Pritzker speaks about the Texas Republican plans to redraw the House map during a press conference at the Democratic Party of DuPage County office in Carol Stream, IL on Sunday, Aug. 3, 2025. A vote on the proposed maps was set for Monday in the Texas House, but it cannot proceed if Democratic members deny a quorum by going to another state, which puts them beyond the reach of Texas law enforcement. After one group of Democrats landed Sunday in Chicago, they were welcomed by Illinois Gov. What that looks like, we don't know,” said state Rep. Gene Wu, the Texas House Democratic Caucus leader. But legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, including in 2021 when many of the same Texas House Democrats left the state for 38 days to protest new voting restrictions. Once they returned, Republicans still passed that measure. Four years later, Abbott is taking a far more aggressive stance and warning Democrats that he will seek to remove them from office if they are not back when the House reconvenes Monday. He also suggested the lawmakers may have committed felonies by raising money to help pay for fines they could face. House Democrats issued a four-word statement: “Come and take it.” And some lawmakers who relocated to other states taunted the governor in response. “He has no legal mechanism,” said Texas Rep. Jolanda Jones, one of the lawmakers who was in New York. Lawmakers cannot pass bills in the 150-member Texas House without at least two-thirds of them present. Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows said the chamber would still meet as planned on Monday afternoon. “If a quorum is not present then, to borrow the recent talking points from some of my Democrat colleagues, all options will be on the table,” he posted on X. Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, said on X that Democrats who “try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately.” Former Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Trey Martinez Fischer speaks about Texas Republican plans to redraw the House map during a press conference at the Democratic Party of DuPage County office in Carol Stream, IL on Sunday, Aug. 3, 2025. Two years later, Republicans pushed through new rules that allow daily fines of $500 for lawmakers who don't show up for work as punishment. The lack of a quorum will also delay votes on disaster assistance and new warning systems in the wake of last month's catastrophic floods in Texas that killed at least 136 people. Democrats had called for votes on the flooding response before taking up redistricting and have criticized Republicans for not doing so. Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential contender who has been one of Trump's most outspoken critics during his second term, had been in quiet talks with Texas Democrats for weeks about offering support if they chose to leave the state. Last week, the governor hosted several Texas Democrats in Illinois to publicly oppose the redistricting effort, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom held a similar event in his own state. “This is not just rigging the system in Texas, it's about rigging the system against the rights of all Americans for years to come,” Pritzker said Sunday night. Trump is looking to avoid a repeat of his first term, when Democrats flipped the House just two years into his presidency, and he hopes the new Texas map will aid that effort. Trump officials have also looked at redrawing lines in other states.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Texas lawmakers gathered in New York to blast Republicans' redistricting proposal after more than 50 Texas House Democrats fled the state ahead of a scheduled legislative session on Monday. As the GOP seeks to redraw congressional maps and add as many as five congressional seats in their favor, state Democrats broke quorum, or the minimum number of legislators needed to conduct business, and traveled to Illinois, Boston, and Albany, New York. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) said during a press conference that the fleeing lawmakers are “brave soldiers for our democracy” and they are on the “right side of history.” “History will judge us for how we respond to this moment,” Hochul said. “Today on the House floor, House Republicans do not want to put flood relief, disaster relief — they didn't want to do anything for the people of Texas. They're bending the knee to President Donald Trump,” Plesa said. Greg Abbott (R-TX) is threatening to remove the lawmakers from office. The state lawmakers are also facing $500 fines and possible legal action from Texas GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton. Hochul said the Texas Democrats would be leaving New York today, but advised the lawmakers not to say where they are heading next. Texas Democratic state Rep. James Talarico, who is with the delegation of state leaders in Illinois, told the Washington Examiner, “No, we're not going back today!” Plesa said Texas Democrats are “building a coalition” and meeting with Democratic governors across the country. “We're continuing to bring coalitions into the fold and educating people as to what's happening and letting them know that the rules have changed,” Plesa said. Texas Democratic state Rep. Lulu Flores said the Democrats are not “abandoning our jobs,” as Republicans and Abbott have accused. “I represent a Democratic district, and our voices deserve to be heard. In response to Texas's redistricting, blue states such as New York and California have begun exploring options to hold their own mid-decade redistricting to offset any additional GOP seats drawn by the Lone Star State. Hochul said at the presser that she is exploring “every option” with state leaders to redraw New York's congressional lines “as soon as possible.” New York Democrats unveiled a bill last week that would begin mid-decade redistricting in 2027, only if another state does it first. New York Democratic Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie said there's “no such thing as nonpartisan in politics” when asked if the mindset of New York not playing fair because Texas isn't playing fair could lead to a “slippery slope.” “I think it's difficult to ask New York, California, and other Democratic-leaning states to play non-partisan while the Republicans play very partisan,” Heastie said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even more colorectal cancer cases are being found in adults under 50, and a new collection of research suggests that a surge in screening may be tied to many of the more recent diagnoses – but not the overall trend. In 2018, the American Cancer Society updated its guidelines for colon and rectal cancer screening, recommending that adults at average risk get screened starting at age 45 – earlier than 50, which was previously advised. Then, in 2021, the US Preventive Services Task force also lowered the recommended age to start screening for colon and rectal cancers from 50 to 45. Lowering the screening age “has likely facilitated earlier detection of cancers that might have been missed,” but there is still more work to do to identify the driving factors behind the ongoing overall rise of colorectal cancer in younger ages, Dr. Joseph Rinaldi, a gastroenterologist at Montefiore Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center, said in an email. “It is likely that factors beyond screening guidelines are contributing to the overall rise in colorectal cancer incidence,” Rinaldi said. “Much work remains to identify causal factors – whether environmental, genetic, or population-based – that can be targeted for prevention and, potentially, reversal of this trend.” “We've been waiting for screening to take off in this age group,” Schafer, an author on the new screening study, said in the email. New research presents promising findings on colorectal cancer treatment and prevention “Local stage diagnosis was rare in this age group before screening because there are usually no symptoms yet,” Schafer said of early-stage cancers that have not spread to other parts of the body. As a rise in colon and rectal cancers persists among younger adults, public health experts now urge them to know the warning signs and to get screened when eligible. More than half of the people who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer before 50 are not eligible for screening because they haven't yet reached the recommended age of 45. And most people who are eligible have still not been screened, said Jessica Star, associate scientist of cancer risk factors and screening surveillance research at the American Cancer Society, who was lead author on the new screening study and an author on the other paper. Whether someone is recommended for screening or not, they should still watch for signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer and talk with their doctor if they notice any, she said. The most common symptom is rectal bleeding,” Star said in an email, adding that 41% of patients under 50 tend to experience this symptom, compared with 26% of patients older than 50. “Young people, especially, are reluctant to talk about these types of symptoms, but it could actually save their life,” Star said. “Other important symptoms include a persistent change in bowel habits or the shape of stool, decreased appetite, and weight loss. There are too many stories about young people being told they have hemorrhoids, finding out months or years later that it is cancer.” Immunotherapy helps certain cancer patients avoid surgery: ‘We hope this is the future' The doctor immediately ordered a colonoscopy, and that's what led to her being diagnosed with stage III rectal cancer at age 28 in 2020. “To self-advocate is such a big one,” Spill said. Spill was treated with an immunotherapy drug called dostarlimab and is now a healthy mother of three. Getting screened can help reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, because almost all colorectal cancers begin as precancerous polyps in the colon or rectum. But through screening, these polyps can be identified and removed before they turn cancerous. A separate study published Monday in JAMA found that when people newly eligible for screening were automatically mailed a fecal test kit at their home address without asking for it, they were more likely to complete screening than those who were asked to actively choose between a colonoscopy, a fecal test or deferring screening altogether. Despite recent increases in screening, it's still estimated that more than 1 in 3 adults 45 and older are not getting screened as recommended, according to the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable. Reduce your risk of colon and rectal cancer with these basic steps There are other steps people can take to help prevent colorectal cancer. “There are many things people of all ages can do to reduce their risk, including not smoking, maintaining a healthy body weight, being physically active, avoiding excessive alcohol consumption, and eating a healthy diet that is low in red and processed meat and high in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables,” Star said. More than half of all colorectal cancers in the US are attributable to those modifiable risk factors, according to the American Cancer Society.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) asked to meet with their counterparts, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), to discuss government funding. With government funding set to expire Sept. 30, the House and Senate are bracing for a shutdown. “As Leaders of the House and Senate, you have the responsibility to govern for all Americans and work on a bipartisan basis to avert a painful, unnecessary shutdown at the end of September,” Schumer and Jeffries wrote in the letter first obtained by Punchbowl News. “Yet it is clear that the Trump administration and many within your party are preparing to ‘go it alone' and continue to legislate on a solely Republican basis.” Schumer and Jeffries said they are willing to work with Republicans in a bipartisan manner, highlighting bipartisan support for funding for the Departments of Agriculture and Veterans Affairs. President Donald Trump has not signed any of the annual funding bills for fiscal 2026 into law. Lawmakers in Congress expect to again pass a continuing resolution or stopgap to fund the government through the year. Democratic lawmakers have told Republicans, who hold a narrow majority in both chambers, that if they agree to help them fund the government, they would not work to pass another rescissions bill, which recently defunded previously appropriated funds. Schumer attempted to make a deal with Trump and Republicans to advance some of Trump's judicial nominations in exchange for restoring funding, but the deal fell through. Thune has not said if he is ready to negotiate with Democratic lawmakers to keep the government open, saying he will see what happens in the coming weeks.</p>

A crew disembarks the Indian navy ship guided-missile destroyer, INS Delhi, that is docked at Manila's port, Philippines, on Friday, Aug. 1, 2025. MANILA, Philippines (AP) — India and the Philippines have staged joint naval exercises in the disputed South China Sea for the first time, a high-profile military deployment that antagonized China. Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Gen. Romeo Brawner said Monday that the two-day joint naval sail and exercises which began Sunday went successfully, and expressed hopes that Filipino forces could engage India's military in more joint maneuvers in the future. Asked if Chinese forces carried out any action in response, Brawner said without elaborating that “we did not experience any untoward incident but we were still shadowed. Two Chinese navy ships, including a guided-missile destroyer, were spotted about 25 nautical miles (46 kilometers) from one of two Philippine navy frigates that participated in the joint sail on Sunday, the Philippine military said. Without mentioning India by name, the Southern Theater Command accused the Philippines of drawing in outside countries to organize joint patrols that it said undermine regional peace and stability. China's Foreign Ministry said territorial disputes should be resolved by those directly involved without any third-party intervention. Separately, Beijing's expansive claims to virtually the entire South China Sea, a key global trade route, have led to tense confrontations with other claimant states, particularly the Philippines and Vietnam. Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also lay claims to parts of the contested waters. It has allowed journalists to join territorial sea and aerial patrols to witness China's increasingly aggressive actions, provoking angry Chinese reactions. In response to a question last week about Manila's plans to build up military cooperation, China's Ministry of National Defense called the Philippines a “troublemaker” that has aligned itself with foreign forces to stir up trouble in what China deems its own territorial waters. “The way to do that is, number one, the Armed Forces of the Philippines has to be strengthened through modernization, and secondly, we need to partner with like-minded nations and that's what we're doing with India,” he said last week. During a reception on board an Indian navy tanker, the INS Shakti, on Thursday, Brawner said the vessel's port call in Manila was more than ceremonial. It “sends a powerful signal of solidarity, strength in partnership and the energy of cooperation between two vibrant democracies in the Indo-Pacific,” he said. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos left Monday for a five-day state visit to India for talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top officials to boost defense, trade and investment, agriculture, tourism and pharmaceutical industry engagements.

White House senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro discusses whether he believes President Donald Trump's tariffs policies will hold up in court on ‘The Will Cain Show.' After an exhaustive investigation by the Department of Commerce under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, President Trump is imposing significant tariffs on imported copper. This critical material is as essential now to America's economic and national security as oil, electricity, and semiconductors. Indeed, in an era defined by artificial intelligence, grid modernization, and advanced computing, copper has become indispensable for technological innovation and defense. Our military systems—from aircraft and submarines to advanced weaponry—rely heavily on copper, as do essential civilian sectors, including the electrical grid, telecommunications networks, and cutting-edge manufacturing. Despite copper's strategic importance, America's copper industry continues to be hollowed out by unfair foreign trade practices—including state-subsidized overcapacity and below-cost dumping by countries like China, Vietnam, and India to export manipulation and predatory pricing by countries like Chile, Peru, and Mexico. These practices, often violating WTO rules, depress global copper prices and discourage investment in domestic smelting and refining facilities. Combined with burdensome domestic regulations, this has left America dangerously reliant on foreign sources for a metal critical to our defense and economic security. Our refining capacity alone has declined by 56 percent since the late 1990s, forcing us into the absurd position of exporting raw copper ore and scrap overseas, only to re-import finished products. The trade deficit in copper-intensive downstream products underscores our vulnerability. Last year alone, America imported nearly a million metric tons of refined copper to meet basic domestic needs. Every pound of copper imported is a pound we could and should be processing right here at home, creating American jobs and securing our supply chains. America has become dangerously reliant on foreign sources for a metal integral to our defense and economic security. To address this threat, President Trump, acting decisively under Section 232 authority, has imposed tariffs designed to rebuild and safeguard America's copper supply chains. Specifically, the President is implementing an immediate 50 percent tariff on imported semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products. These measured steps will provide critical breathing room for U.S. companies to ramp up domestic refining and processing capabilities. Trump Tariff "panicans" will inevitably complain about costs and economic disruption. But let's be clear: these tariffs represent a modest and necessary premium compared to the enormous risks posed by continued dependence on foreign copper. We've learned from prior Section 232 actions on steel and aluminum that tariffs can successfully revitalize critical industries. Those actions attracted billions of dollars in new investment, restored domestic capacity, created thousands of jobs, and secured crucial materials for our military and infrastructure. The tariffs on copper will yield similar results. They will catalyze the revival of domestic refining and smelting capabilities, incentivize investment in new technologies, and put Americans back to work in states across our great land producing the copper we desperately need. The United States holds abundant copper reserves—enough to fully meet domestic demand for approximately 40 years. Arizona alone hosts some of the country's largest deposits, including the Morenci mine, one of North America's most productive copper sources. This is economic nationalism for national security's sake. In an era defined by strategic competition and supply chain vulnerabilities, we cannot afford passive reliance on foreign producers who harm our country with their massive exports. These new Trump copper tariffs will help reduce America's persistent trade deficit and safeguard our economy against dangerous supply interruptions during geopolitical tensions or future global crises. Domestic production of critical materials like copper is not just sound economics; it's imperative to maintain our sovereignty and security. America's copper industry—and the American workers who sustain it—have waited far too long for decisive action. By invoking Section 232, President Trump is taking exactly that kind of decisive, bold action to put American security first. President Trump's message is clear: the United States will no longer tolerate economic policies that hollow out our industries and jeopardize national security.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was just after 7 p.m. on a Monday when staff at the Korian Les Amarantes nursing home in Tours, southwest of Paris, discovered 92-year-old Yvette Brisset dead in her bed. She had apparently choked on a madeleine — one of France's famed scallop-shaped, lemon-flavored cakes. The cake had been brought to her earlier that evening by a man named Alain Jousselin. Jousselin, then 60, wasn't a family member or friend. He was a former firefighter who had bought Brisset's home 25 years earlier through a little-known French property scheme known as viager — and had been waiting ever since to move in, his lawyer, Abed Benjador, told CNN. In a viager sale, elderly homeowners — often in their 70s, 80s or 90s — sell their properties at a steep discount, sometimes for half the market value. In return, they receive a monthly payment from the buyer. “Women live about five years longer, so a 75-year-old woman would have the same discount. For couples, the discount is even higher, since they tend to live longer together.” When she died, on May 13, 2019, suspicion quickly turned toward him, his lawyer said. No one in the family knew Jousselin before Brisset's death, her granddaughter, Emiline Dupoy, wrote in a letter published by French newspaper La Nouvelle Republique ahead of Jousselin's trial. French media dubbed the case l'affaire de la madeleine. “I don't know if my client killed her intentionally,” Benjador said. On December 9, 2023, the murder charge against Jousselin was downgraded to involuntary manslaughter. While prosecutors could not prove he intended to kill the victim, the Loiret Court of Appeal accepted that Jousselin had given Brisset a madeleine — describing it as an act of “imprudence” directly linked to her death. While trials like Jousselin's involving viager sales are disturbing, they remain extremely rare. And they haven't dampened enthusiasm for the housing arrangement — especially among foreign buyers eager to pick up French property at below-market prices. “Over the past two years, I've had around a dozen international buyers — about half of them American,” said Reza Nakhai, who owns a Paris-based agency called Viva Viager. For Americans dreaming of a pied-à-terre in Paris, viager could be a golden ticket — if they're willing to play the long game. In Saint-Germain-des-Prés, the chic Left Bank enclave once home to Ernest Hemingway and Simone de Beauvoir, a 100-square-meter apartment now sells for an average of $1.7 million. In Le Marais — a favorite among both the Parisian It crowd and American buyers — 2025 prices range from $15,500 to $22,000 per square meter, according to real estate agency Talvan's International. But with viager, buyers can snap up prime real estate for less than half that price. Homa Raevel, an American-Iranian investor and mother of five, has bought four viager properties in Paris. “At first, it felt a little morbid,” Raevel told CNN. But I made it a point to meet every seller, hear their story. With viager, you're helping older people stay in their homes while giving them financial security — it's a win-win.” When scouting a property, the first things Raevel says she looks for are location and layout. “In France, especially in Paris, you often find kitchens at one end of the flat and dining rooms at the other, connected by narrow hallways,” she said. “I look for apartments with high ceilings and an open floor plan, often in up-and-coming areas.” “I only buy if the seller seems to be living a happy life,” she said. “If someone is dealing with family conflicts or selling under stressful circumstances, I'll pass. The practice of viager itself dates back to Roman times. “Back then, elderly people would pass on property to their children or nephews in exchange for a small sum and the ability to continue living in their homes,” the agent Coubronne told CNN. “That's why you also find viager-style arrangements in countries like Spain, Italy and parts of Belgium,” Coubronne said. Viager sales aren't just popular among ordinary citizens — they've also attracted some of France's most prominent figures. Former presidents Charles de Gaulle, Valérie Giscard d'Estaing and François Hollande all acquired properties through viager arrangements. In France, the centuries-old system is especially popular among homeowners without heirs. “If I had children, I'd want them to inherit,” said André Helman, a 74-year-old psychoanalyst who recently sold his Paris apartment as a viager. “But I don't, so this is the perfect solution — it lets me stay in my home and live comfortably on a steady income.” Helman's one-bedroom flat was purchased for 250,000 euros — around half its market value — by Ylla Heron, a 21-year-old fashion student. “I don't need to live here right now,” she told CNN. “People are uncomfortable with viager because of the death aspect,” he said. “But for me, dying is a natural part of life. The idea that this charming young woman will eventually live in my home — it's actually very pleasant to me.” The system may prove a timely solution for France's rapidly aging population. As living costs rise, securing stable finances in later life is becoming increasingly urgent. But viager isn't without risk for the buyer. In addition to paying a lump-sum down payment — poetically referred to as le bouquet — buyers must make monthly payments that could stretch decades. “I always calculate for the seller living to 100,” Raevel told CNN. “If they live beyond that, I might not make a profit. She lived another 32 years, outlasting the buyer by two. His family was legally required to continue making monthly payments until Calment's death at 122. “I've never seen anything like that with my clients. But it shows how human this business really is. I've been invited to the funerals of sellers by their families. Viager is more than a property transaction — it's about trust and connection.” For Raevel, the American investor, it's also a matter of values.</p>

Cory Booker, D-N.J., blasted his fellow Democrats for being "complicit" with President Donald Trump's actions during a testy objection to a package of new police legislation voted on by the Senate earlier today. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., responded to Sen. Corey Booker's, D-N.J., outburst on the Senate floor last week in an interview with The New York Times. Cortez Masto was asked by the New York Times to respond to Booker's accusations against Democrats that they were "complicit" with President Donald Trump's agenda. "I don't need lectures from anyone on how to push back and fight this administration. I'm also from a swing state; I've still got to get stuff done on behalf of my state," Masto told The New York Times. Sen. Cory Booker slams his own party members as "complicit" to President Donald Trump after they rejected amendments he argued would prevent Trump from picking winners and losers as it pertains to federal funding. Booker accused his fellow Democratic senators last week of aligning themselves with Trump because they are in favor of passing new police legislation. "It is time for Democrats to have a backbone. It's time for us to draw a line, and when it comes to the safety of my state being denied these grants, that's why I'm standing here." Sen. Corey Booker accused fellow Democratic of aligning themselves with President Donald Trump because they are in favor of passing new police legislation. Booker's objection stemmed from a call from Democrats to pass a package of law enforcement-related bills aimed at boosting resources for police, including shoring up death benefits for officers lost in the line of duty, providing greater mental health support for officers, and addressing child exploitation. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto responded to Sen. Corey Booker's outburst on the Senate floor last week in an interview with The New York Times. "Why would you throw out good legislation that's going to benefit everyone across the country? That's part of gaining the trust of Americans again, so they understand there are people that are working on their behalf," Masto said. "But most importantly, we have to win.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When authoritarianism encroaches, apologists often present a strongman's power grabs as rational — even imperative for the national good. Top Trump administration aides followed that playbook on Sunday, justifying the president's abrupt firing of the government's top labor official in charge of employment statistics over jobs numbers that dented his proclamation of a new “golden age.” But it could backfire by eroding the trust of investors, companies and organizations that depend on accurate and truthful statistics on the economy's health to make major decisions that can impact the lives of millions of people. Even the Federal Reserve uses it to decide on monetary policy. Trump says the Bureau of Labor Statistics orchestrated a ‘scam.' And when countries don't firewall official data, they risk ending up like Argentina or Greece, where the invention of rosy statistics masked economic malaise and sparked financial crises. Trump's assault on the BLS is also more than a narrow economic question. It's the latest erratic move by a president who believes he has total power and is immune from consequences, and who has become increasingly hubristic following a string of political wins this summer. And while Republican presidents have sometimes had a point in arguing that their goals can be thwarted by a bureaucracy that they regard as overly liberal, Trump's assault on the federal government that he leads has funneled ever more unaccountable power into the Oval Office. But the president is taking a big economic risk. Senior Trump aides went onto Sunday shows to make a case for his volatile reaction to the jobs numbers that subverted his own version of reality. On Monday, Hassett went even further, making a remarkable statement for someone in his position. Without offering any evidence, Hassett alleged in a CNBC interview that the jobs numbers could be “politically manipulated because they're so untransparent.” Senate Democratic Minority leader Chuck Schumer responded to Hassett's defense of Trump's move by demanding his dismissal. Another top Trump official, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, argued on Sunday that “you want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers.” He said on CBS' “Face the Nation” that “there are always revisions, but sometimes, you see these revisions go in really extreme ways. He can choose who works in the executive branch.” Trump was irked by job data that showed the economy created only 73,000 jobs in July. The monthly totals for May and June were also revised downward by a combined 258,000 jobs. In this case, the jobs numbers appeared to confirm other indicators that contradict Trump's claims the economy is roaring, amid data showing slowing growth and a rise in inflation last month. One big danger now is that Trump's economic fabulism will gather its own momentum and infect confidence in government statistics that will long outlive his presidency. Employment data is published as part of a multilayered process that would be almost impossible for one official to corrupt. If jobs numbers are worse next month, will he fire someone else? And if the numbers improve, will anyone believe in their integrity? “Suppose that they get a new commissioner, and this person, male or female, are just the best people possible, right? Well, everybody's going to think, ‘Well, it's not as bad as it probably really is,' because they're going to suspect political influence,” Beach said on “State of the Union.” The president's turn against his own government's nonpartisan number-crunchers when they produced a report that he didn't like was rather predictable. This mantra was borne out during his first term. But it turned out to set the stage for an entire presidency of fabricating facts. And Trump's claim that Friday's jobs numbers were “rigged” recalls his greatest-ever attack on truth: his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Often, Trump's critics have proclaimed that authoritarianism is on the march whatever he does. There's an entire political and media industrial complex devoted to the idea that Americans are already living under a dictatorship. There's no comparison to the one-party police state endured by citizens of China. But Trump's actions are adding to growing evidence that he is engineering a degradation of democratic and pluralistic institutions. Comparisons between the president and populist authoritarian strongmen leaders such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán or Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan look increasingly apt. Trump single-handedly remade the global trading system by imposing tariffs, apparently according to his whims, while completely bypassing a genuflecting GOP Congress that has done nothing to defend its constitutional authority to dictate policy in that area. His transformation of the intelligence services into a vessel for his political convenience has led to false claims and probes accusing President Barack Obama's administration of treason over Russian election meddling in 2016. Trump's weaponization of the Justice Department is creating immense suspicion after Ghislaine Maxwell was moved to a more lenient prison after two days of talks with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. Trump is struggling to end a political crisis over his ties to her late associate Jeffrey Epstein, an accused sex trafficker and convicted sex offender. And on Sunday, Trump's demands for a rewriting of congressional districts in Texas to make it easier for Republicans to cling onto the House next year precipitated a political crisis that is now having national implications. He's pardoned or released criminals convicted in connection with the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. The Pentagon has removed photos of top brass who contradicted him from its walls. And Trump has repeatedly attacked judges and claimed their actions are illegal as part of a pattern of behavior that CNN's Aaron Blake has justifiably called Orwellian. An apparent sense that there's no restraint on his power now seems to be feeding into Trump's foreign policy. Medvedev is now mostly known as an online troll and has only a minor position in Russian politics, so it's hard to understand why Trump was so easily goaded. Meanwhile, Trump had a volcanic reaction following a rare show of dissent from Capitol Hill when Democrats, using their minority privileges in the Senate, blocked an attempt to ram through his conservative judicial nominees before the summer recess. Such an extreme reaction to a rather routine example of congressional gridlock only underscores how Trump has become used to getting his way.</p>
