                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a series of papers published on preprint servers and in various online journals (including Optica, arXiv, and Quantum), researchers including ÖAW's Miguel Navascués and University of Vienna's Philip Walther explain the possibility of speeding up, slowing down, and even reversing the flow of time within a quantum system. “In a theater [classical physics], a movie is projected from beginning to end, regardless of what the audience wants,” he told the Spanish-language newspaper El País. We can rewind to a previous scene or skip several scenes ahead.” Using an experimental device called a “quantum switch,” the single photon of light returns to its previous state before it ever makes the journey. In a way, this is less Doc Brown-style time travel and more about reverting or otherwise altering the states of quantum particles, or “time translation” as Navascués described in 2020. However, this isn't exactly like a rewind button on your TV because usually, viewers can see how things got from plot point A to B—just sped up and in reverse. In quantum mechanics, however, simply observing a system causes it to change, which makes it impossible to track a system's progress through time. Crucially, these rewinding protocols still work because they can be performed without knowing what the changes were or its “internal dynamics,” according to the scientists. And this quantum time machine doesn't just go one direction—Navascués said they've also hit upon a method for going forward in evolutionary time as well. Sadly, these sci-fi findings in the quantum world can't be sized up to send humans backward and forward in time, because a single human represents a mind-boggling amount of information to “rejuvenate”—in fact, the scientists estimate it would take millions of years to pull it off for just one second. After all, if life had a rewind button, wouldn't you use it?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How Teen Mathematician Hannah Cairo Disproved a Major Mathematical Wave Conjecture When she was just 17 years old, Hannah Cairo disproved the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture, breaking a four-decade-old mathematical assumption When Hannah Cairo was 17 years old, she disproved the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture, a long-standing guess in the field of harmonic analysis about how waves behave on curved surfaces. If the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture turned out to be true, it would illuminate many other significant questions in the field. But after hitting wall after wall trying to prove it, Cairo managed to come up with a counterexample: a circumstance where the waves don't behave as predicted by the conjecture. Cairo got hooked on the problem after being assigned a simpler version of the conjecture to prove as a homework assignment for a class she was taking at the University of California, Berkeley. “It took me a while to convince [course instructor] Ruixiang Zhang that my proposal was actually correct,” she says. Now, under Zhang's advisement, she has a paper on the preprint server arXiv.org and was invited to present her results at the International Conference on Harmonic Analysis and Partial Differential Equations in El Escorial, Spain.

Cairo says she loves talking about her research and giving presentations with colorful and descriptive slides (see examples below). When asked what she studies, Cairo says, in short, “points, lines and waves.” Born and raised in the Bahamas, Cairo moved to California at the age of 16, where she began to take classes at U.C. Now, at 18 years old, she is on to a Ph.D. program at the University of Maryland to continue her research in Fourier restriction theory. Scientific American spoke to Cairo about the way harmonic analysis is like dropping stones into a still pond, her transgender identity and the reasons she loves mathematics. Beyond “points, lines, and waves,” how would you explain your field of study, harmonic analysis? You see these circular waves spreading out. If you drop two stones in the pond, then you might notice this pattern called an interference pattern: instead of looking like circles, they overlap. And you get these interesting shapes [where they intersect]. Slide from Hannah Cairo's presentation on the Mizohata-Takeuchi Conjecture My specialty is known as Fourier restriction theory, which is the subdiscipline of harmonic analysis that I work in, where we ask what kind of objects can we build if we're only allowed to use certain kinds of waves. You won't be able to get just any object. What does it mean to be “concentrated along lines”? There are a few different ways you can define it. One possible way is to take a thin, long rectangle and ask how much of your circle can lie in this thin rectangle. On the other hand, if you take something flat like the edge of a square, then you can get a whole side of that square just on one thin tube. And we want to say that not very much is going to lie on shapes that do not contain very many lines or thin rectangles. So how did you manage to disprove this conjecture? So you end up looking at these waves that are concentrated on rectangles: You take these waves, and they intersect each other, and they make these certain shapes, but here [instead of circle waves] we use rectangle waves. So then we have all of these rectangle waves meeting each other. What I realized is that the shape of where they meet is not quite at the right angle to agree with the direction that these rectangles are pointing in. The original fractal construction doesn't actually show up in your paper though. What I found out is that if you arrange these waves by taking a high-dimensional hypercube and projecting it down into smaller-dimensional space and then taking only those waves that lie in your region, then this is how you can determine where to put them [to break the conjecture]. I think that, for me, mathematics is an art. In my childhood, I was somewhat lonely. Math was sort of there as a friend almost. I think that art cannot necessarily be a friend in every way that a friend can be, but I think art is like a friend. Tell me more about how math was a friend to you. And I think that if one were to take a class on paint, you could memorize the dates and times at which various forms of paint were developed—and maybe even which paints were used by which painters. And then you can figure out what processes you can use to determine what type of paint it is. Maybe there is an art to learning about paint. But I think that math is a little bit like that—in school, people learn about [the mathematical version of] paint; they're not learning about painting. If I'm having a sad day, a happy day, if I move to Maryland (I did just move to Maryland), mathematics is still there, and it is still the same thing. It's also just something that can occupy my mind. I think that it's probably more relevant in my journey as a person than as a mathematician. Being trans has forced me to see things about the world that I maybe otherwise wouldn't have seen. Fortunately, in the math community, I think that most mathematicians are fine with trans people. I think that it used to be more significant [in my day to day] than it is now. These days it doesn't really make much of a difference. Why have you decided to go on the record now as being trans? People have ideas about who trans people are, and I think that it's best to broaden that. I think that part of what helps trans people realize that they're trans is to know that there are more options for who you can be as a trans person. Where is your favorite place to do math? I could just be sitting down somewhere thinking about stuff, or I could be going for a walk outside. I also like to talk to other people about math, which is another kind of doing math. I really like to give presentations about mathematics. Luckily, in harmonic analysis, I can give a presentation like this, and then everybody is so happy, and they tell me my slides are cute. I'm working on a research project with my adviser on Mizohata-Takeuchi and adjacent stuff and about a sort of different thing: the local Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture. The process of learning more about this kind of mathematics is pretty exciting—not just for me learning more about what's out there but for the math community as a whole to try to understand these kinds of things better.

Ultraprocessed food (UPF) consumption is associated with noncommunicable disease risk, yet no trial has assessed its health impact within the context of national dietary guidelines. In a 2 × 2 crossover randomized controlled feeding trial, 55 adults in England (body mass index ≥25 to <40 kg m−2, habitual UPF intake ≥50% kcal day−1) were provided with two 8-week ad libitum diets following the UK Eatwell Guide: (1) minimally processed food (MPF) and (2) UPF, in a random order. Twenty-eight people were randomized to MPF then UPF, and 27 to UPF then MPF; 50 participants comprised the intention-to-treat sample. The primary outcome was the within-participant difference in percent weight change (%WC) between diets, from baseline to week 8. Participants were blinded to the primary outcome. Mild gastrointestinal adverse events were common on both diets. Findings indicate greater weight loss on MPF than UPF diets and needing dietary guidance on food processing in addition to existing recommendations. Three billion people worldwide live with overweight or obesity1, driving increased risks of noncommunicable disease and early death2. A proposed cause has been from recent major changes in the food environment3. In particular, the increased accessibility and consumption of ultraprocessed food (UPF)3,4. Most commonly defined using the Nova classification5, UPF are industrial formulations combining extracts of original foods with additives and industrial ingredients5. Examples include breakfast cereals, sweets, and mass-produced bread5. Over 50% of UK energy intake is reported to come from UPF6, with similarly high intakes in the USA and Europe7. Higher UPF intakes are associated with increased risks of obesity8, cardiometabolic disease, and all-cause mortality9,10. As a result, countries including Brazil11 and organizations including the World Health Organization12 recommend reducing UPF intake in their dietary guidance. In the UK, where nearly two-thirds of adults live with overweight or obesity13, calls have been made for policy action on reducing UPF, yet this is still debated14. The EWG focuses on macronutrients (for example, fat, protein, carbohydrate) and food groups (for example, fruits and vegetables, dairy, starchy food), but not UPF16. Currently fewer than 0.1% of UK adults follow EWG recommendations, and nearly 70% follow less than half of the recommendations17. SACN recently reported that there was insufficient evidence to include UPF within dietary guidelines18, with the 2025 US Dietary Guidelines for Americans Committee (DGAC) reaching similar conclusions19. Both SACN and the US DGAC19 recommended that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed due to the lack of high-quality interventional evidence18. SACN particularly recommended trials comparing UPF with minimally processed food (MPF) in the context of existing UK dietary recommendations18. Current evidence suggests that the associations between UPF and adverse health outcomes are not explained by macronutrient or food group guidance within dietary recommendations10. To date, two RCTs demonstrate unfavorable weight changes on UPF compared with MPF diets matched for presented energy and nutrients20,21, but no RCTs have assessed the health impact of food processing in the context of dietary guidance. Therefore, ‘Ultra processed versus minimally processed diets following UK dietary guidance on health outcomes' (UPDATE)—a single-center, community-based, 2 × 2 crossover RCT—aimed to compare the health effects between 8-week MPF and UPF diets following EWG recommendations (Fig. The primary objective was to compare percentage weight change (%WC) between diets. Secondary objectives were to compare changes in anthropometrics, body composition, cardiometabolic and appetite-related outcomes between diets. a, UPDATE study design and measurement timepoints. b, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram. Between April 2023 and May 2024, 135 adults underwent screening, of whom 55 (40.1%) were eligible and allocated randomly to either MPF then UPF (n = 28), or UPF then MPF (n = 27) diets. In total, 50 participants provided primary outcome data for at least one diet (intention-to-treat (ITT)) and 43 provided primary outcome data for both diets without withdrawal (per protocol (PP)). Baseline characteristics are given in Table 1. Mean habitual UPF intake was 67.4% kcal day−1 (s.e., 1.1), with mean macronutrient and food group intakes not adherent to EWG recommendations, except red meat intake. Baseline characteristics for ITT and PP samples are in Supplementary Tables 1–3. In the ITT analysis, %WC at 8 weeks was significantly lower on both diets (MPF, −2.06% ((95% confidence interval (CI), −2.99, −1.13); UPF, −1.05% (95% CI, −1.98, −0.13)) (Fig. Within-participant differences in %WC were significantly greater on the MPF versus UPF diet (Δ%WC, −1.01% (s.e., 0.43; 95% CI, −1.87, −0.14; P = 0.024).

A significant diet order effect was detected (Pinteraction < 0.05; Extended Data Fig. A larger Δ%WC was observed when analyzing the first-period diet of each arm only (Δ%WC, −1.86% (s.e., 0.72); P = 0.012). Secondary ITT outcomes are in Table 2, with unadjusted changes and changes by randomization arm in Supplementary Tables 5 and 6, respectively. Weight and BMI were significantly lower at 8 weeks from baseline on both diets. Waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio did not differ significantly. Reductions in weight (−0.96 kg (s.e., 0.40); P = 0.019) and BMI (−0.34 kg m−2 (s.e., 0.14); P = 0.021) were significantly greater on the MPF versus UPF diet, with no significant differences in waist circumference. Fat mass, body fat percentage, visceral fat rating and total body water mass were significantly lower at 8 weeks from baseline on the MPF but not UPF diet. Reductions in fat mass (−0.98 kg (s.e., 0.32); P = 0.004), body fat percentage (−0.76% (s.e., 0.28); P = 0.010), visceral fat rating (−0.41 (s.e., 0.15); P = 0.008) and total body water mass (−0.51 kg (s.e., 0.15); P = 0.002) were significantly greater on the MPF compared with UPF diet. Other body composition outcomes did not differ significantly between diets. Systolic blood pressure (BP) (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly lower at 8 weeks compared with baseline on the MPF but not UPF diet, whereas heart rate (HR) was significantly lower on the UPF but not MPF diet. Changes in BP and HR did not differ significantly between diets. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and non-HDL-C were significantly lower at 8 weeks compared with baseline on both diets. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and triglycerides were significantly lower at 8 weeks compared with baseline on the MPF diet only, whereas fasting glucose and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were significantly lower at 8 weeks compared with baseline on the UPF diet only. Bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, albumin, total-cholesterol-to-HDL ratio and C-reactive protein (CRP) did not differ significantly at 8 weeks compared with baseline on either diet. Changes in triglycerides were significantly lower on the MPF than UPF diet (−0.25 mmol l−1 (s.e., 0.08); P = 0.004), whereas changes in LDL-C were significantly lower on the UPF than MPF diet (0.25 mmol l−1 (s.e., 0.10); P = 0.016). Changes in other biomarkers did not differ significantly. The Power of Food Scale (PFS) (food present, tasted and total score) and Control of Eating Questionnaire (CoEQ) craving for sweet, savory and difficulty to resist craved nominated food were significantly lower at 8 weeks from baseline on the MPF but not UPF diet. CoEQ craving control was significantly higher at 8 weeks on both diets. PFS food available and CoEQ positive mood at 8 weeks did not differ significantly from baseline on either diet. Improvements in CoEQ craving for savory (−10.46 (s.e., 4.12); P = 0.015), difficulty to resist craved nominated food (−13.77 (s.e., 6.35); P = 0.037) and craving control (11.68 (s.e., 4.74); P = 0.019) were significantly greater on the MPF than UPF diet. Other changes in CoEQ and PFS did not differ significantly between diets. Fasted and fed visual analog scales (VAS) did not significantly differ at 8 weeks from baseline on either diet, and changes were not significantly different between diets (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). Trends were observed for lower postprandial hunger, capacity to eat, pleasure to eat and feelings of fullness on the MPF versus UPF diet (Fig. computed from mixed-effects models adjusted for randomization arm and nightshift status, with an interaction term for diet and randomization arm, interaction term for diet and time at visit (0, 15, 30 min) and a random effect for participant; ITT N = 50. Self-reported diet intake data from the MPF and UPF diets are in Supplementary Tables 9–13. In the ITT sample, energy intake was −503.7 kcal day−1 (s.e., 130.2; P < 0.001) and −289.6 kcal day−1 (s.e., 102.8; P = 0.007) lower during the MPF and UPF diet compared with baseline, respectively. Self-reported energy intake was significantly lower (−327.3 kcal day−1 (s.e., 110.2; P = 0.005) on the MPF versus UPF diet. In the ITT sample (N = 50), 32 and 35 participants provided completed food diaries for MPF and UPF diets, respectively. Diet ratings are listed in Supplementary Tables 14 and 15 (by randomization arm). There were no significant differences in ratings of the diets overall, meals and snacks overall, textures, portion sizes, hunger levels, contentment and sustainability. There were no significant differences in the change in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) performed from baseline to week 8 between diets (Supplementary Table 16). Adverse events (AE) are listed in Table 3. AEs were common and mild on both diets, with no related serious AEs (SAEs). Changes in body composition corresponded to estimated daily energy imbalances of −289.9 kcal day−1 (95% CI, −423.7, −156.1) and −119.5 kcal day−1 (95% CI, −251.7, 12.7) on MPF and UPF diets, respectively, which was significantly lower on the MPF diet (−170.4 kcal day−1 (s.e., 57.9); P = 0.005). Maintaining the 8-week weight loss trajectories over 1 year would be estimated to result in ~9% and ~13% weight loss on the MPF diet, and ~5% and ~4% weight loss on the UPF diet, for female and male participants, respectively. Habitual UPF intake and initial weight were not significantly associated with %WC on either diet. Habitual energy intake was inversely associated with %WC on the MPF (P = 0.033) but not UPF diet (P = 0.090). Changes in waist-to-height ratio at 8 weeks from baseline did not differ significantly between diets (Supplementary Table 17). In prespecified sensitivity analyses, results were consistent at 4 weeks (Supplementary Table 18), in repeated-measures analyses (Supplementary Table 19), in PP analyses (Supplementary Tables 8 and 20–22) and in sensitivity analyses using inverse probability weighting and multiple imputation (Supplementary Table 23). In post hoc sensitivity analyses, results were consistent when analyzing primary outcome data only where participants provided diet adherence data (Supplementary Table 23), and when using first-period diet data only, except that BP changes were significantly lower on the MPF versus UPF diet, and fasting glucose change was no longer significantly different between diets (Supplementary Tables 6 and 8). In this study, both MPF and UPF diets following national healthy dietary guidance resulted in percentage weight loss after 8 weeks, with significantly greater reductions on the MPF diet. Greater weight, BMI and fat mass loss were also observed on the MPF compared with the UPF diet, as well as greater reductions in triglycerides and cravings. Conversely, LDL-C was lower on the UPF diet. Overall, these results suggest favorable changes in body composition and craving control from adhering to national dietary guidance with a diet of MPF rather than UPF. These findings build on two metabolic ward RCTs assessing the health impacts of ad libitum UPF and MPF/non-UPF diets matched for presented calories and nutrients, highlighting the importance of UPF in addition to traditional dietary guidance. Hall et al. observed weight loss on a 2-week MPF diet (−0.9 kg) and weight gain on a 2-week UPF diet (0.9 kg)20, whereas Hamano et al. reported weight gain on both 7-day non-UPF and UPF diets, but with significantly greater weight gain (1.1 kg (95% CI, 0.2, 2.0)) on the UPF diet21. In contrast with our hypothesis given the body of observational evidence linking UPF with weight gain8, the UPF diet following UK dietary guidance resulted in weight loss. However, weight loss on the MPF diet was significantly greater than on the UPF diet. Our study therefore confirms and builds upon previous findings, showing significant differences in weight change between matched UPF and MPF/non-UPF diets20,21, within the context of existing healthy dietary guidance. Previous trials further considered changes in body composition. Hall et al. found that fat mass increased on the UPF diet, but decreased on the MPF diet, differing significantly between diets20. Similar findings were reported in Hamano et al.21, with additional findings of no liver fat changes. Regarding fat-free mass, Hall et al. observed trends for an increase on the UPF diet and decrease on the MPF diet, which again showed differences20, whereas Hamano et al. saw no significant differences between diets21. Our study builds upon these findings by considering body composition changes from UPF and MPF diets in the context of dietary guidance. We observed that the greater weight loss on the MPF diet was through greater reductions in fat mass and total body water mass, with no significant differences in fat-free mass change between diets. Despite the UPF diet leading to weight loss, there were no significant reductions in adiposity (fat mass, body fat percentage or visceral fat rating), with the greater fat mass reductions on the MPF diet being key in addressing obesity-related poor cardiometabolic health23. However, no significant differences were observed for waist circumference change between diets. Clinically significant weight loss is related directly to favorable changes in cardiometabolic risk factors, including BP, blood glucose, HbA1c and lipids24. Indeed, the UPF diet led to reductions in several cardiometabolic risk factors including HR, fasting glucose, cholesterol and LDL-C. Whereas only the MPF diet resulted in significant BP reduction, this did not differ significantly from the UPF diet. Similarly, limited differences in biomarkers were observed previously. Hall et al. reported lower HDL-C on the MPF versus UPF diet, but no significant differences in triglycerides, high-sensitivity CRP, HbA1c, glucose or LDL-C between diets20. Hamano et al. reported significantly greater reductions in total cholesterol and HDL-C on the non-UPF versus UPF diet, and significantly greater increases in liver function markers on the UPF versus non-UPF diet, but no differences in other markers. For our trial and the two previous trials, longer durations may be required for sufficient weight loss differences to occur between diets for clinically significant differences in cardiometabolic risk factors to emerge. Several mechanisms are proposed for the contrasting weight changes between UPF and MPF diets, including nutrient composition, texture, energy density and eating rate8. In contrast to the two previous trials20,21 and to typical nutrient-poor UPF diets25, the UPF diet in this study followed national healthy dietary guidance. This included nutritionally improved, reformulated UPF such as breakfast cereals, ready meals and plant-based alternatives. These typically have nutrition or health claims and green and amber front-of-package label traffic lights (which guide consumer choice at point-of-purchase, with red traffic lights for products high in fat, saturated fat, sugar and/or salt)25. Such foods are nutritionally comparable to MPF in the UK25 and recommended in current UK dietary guidelines16. Participants' habitual diets were typically misaligned with EWG recommendations and were above average for UPF consumption in the UK6. Therefore, the improvement in diet quality towards EWG recommendations on the provided UPF diet without necessarily increasing UPF intake from participants' habitual diets likely explained the neutral or favorable changes and the absence of detrimental changes on the UPF diet. However, despite this, the UPF diet did not result in the same extent of weight loss as the MPF diet, nor did it result in significant fat loss. Reported energy intakes were in line with the primary outcome findings, with a deficit on both diets, but to a greater extent on the MPF diet. Removing UPF provided additional benefit beyond existing dietary recommendations, suggesting other potential mechanisms of UPF besides nutritional quality. One potential mechanism is energy density. The UPF diet in this trial was more energy dense than the MPF diet. This is representative of nutritionally improved ‘healthy' UPF in the UK, which have a higher energy density than comparable ‘healthy' MPF25. In previous RCTs, nonbeverage energy density of the UPF diet was also higher, with a faster eating rate (both energy and weight)20 and fewer chews per bite on the UPF diet21, which can promote greater energy intake26. Hyperpalatability and taste may also promote increased UPF consumption27. Both previous trials reported similar appetite ratings between diets20. Similarly, we found comparable ratings between diets. However, flavor and taste ratings were significantly lower on the MPF diet. This may have impacted on eating behavior and led to lower consumption on the MPF diet or greater consumption on the UPF diet, as evidenced with withdrawals on the MPF diet but no withdrawals on the UPF diet. There were also improvements in craving control on the MPF versus UPF diet despite greater weight loss, as well as significant reductions in hedonic appetite on the MPF but not UPF diet, although differences were not significant. There were also trends favoring improved subjective appetite in the immediate postprandial state on the MPF diet. Combined, these findings may promote appropriate meal termination on the MPF versus UPF diet, reflected in the greater weight loss, and further supporting long-term weight loss maintenance28. Marketing and advertising heavily influence eating behavior29, particularly UPF30. Previous trials were conducted in metabolic wards, providing UPF without packaging. Although no products on the UPF diet included ‘reduced calorie' labeling, many carried nutrition or health claims. This may have influenced eating behavior and perceptions of appropriate portion sizing31, eating the suggested UPF portion sizes compared with eating ad libitum on the MPF diet. Although no significant differences in AEs were observed between diets, a higher incidence of fatigue and common gastrointestinal issues including constipation and dyspepsia/reflux were observed on the UPF diet. Growing evidence links UPF intake with gastrointestinal pathology, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer and disorders of gut–brain interaction32. This study provides preliminary experimental insights into potential gut disruption from UPF that requires further investigation. An order effect was observed, with less weight loss on the second-period diets across both randomization arms. Hall et al. observed no significant order effects between diets on energy intake, bodyweight or body composition, despite no washout period33. Adherence was likely a factor explaining the lower %WC during second-period diets here, with a notable drop in adherence on the second-period MPF diet and, to a lesser extent, the second-period UPF diet. Furthermore, simultaneously and instantaneously switching onto a healthy diet devoid of ultraprocessing may have had an additive effect on %WC compared with a more modest effect from switching onto a healthy diet that remained high in UPF. The subsequent transition onto the healthy diet devoid of ultraprocessing may have had attenuated effects on %WC. Results were consistent when analyzing data from the first-period diets only, with significant differences of 1.86% in %WC between diets. These findings highlight the benefit of following UK dietary recommendations. Maintaining the 8-week weight loss trajectories over 1 year may result in an estimated 9–13% and 4–5% weight loss on MPF and UPF diets, respectively34. These findings on the relative importance of food processing should complement and expand, not displace, current understanding of diet-related health. The wider food system is key in driving diet-related poor health and obesity by enabling ready availability to cheap, unhealthy food36. Many obesity policies focus on person-level actions, rather than system-level changes. Reductionist approaches focusing solely on nutrient reformulation or individual-level action insufficiently address environmental factors. Diets were matched for UK national dietary guidance, ensuring results are directly relevant for UK public health food policy. Given the similarities between UK and most dietary guidelines worldwide that do not consider UPF, these findings are likely to be relevant to many countries. Participants were blind to the primary outcome and not told to change their weight or dietary intake. Providing all food and drink ready prepared without cost to participants' homes helped maximize adherence, ensure internal validity and minimize dropout39,40. UPF was sourced from leading UK supermarkets and were not culinary preparations, providing a diet representative of UPF available in the UK. Participants' habitual dietary intakes were broadly similar to UK averages41, aiding generalizability to the UK population. The trial was funded by a medical charity and nongovernmental organization, without industry or commercial influence. Limitations include that a potential carryover effect cannot be ruled out. However, the washout period helped minimize this. People with dietary restrictions (for example, vegan, halal, kosher) were excluded due to financial and logistical constraints, limiting generalizability. The results also may not generalize to people with low UPF intake, and do not imply that switching from a low- to high-UPF diet following dietary guidance carries neutral or favorable effects. Not all participants returned their food diaries to monitor adherence. However, reported adherence was high, with previous studies indicating high adherence when all food is provided and delivered to participants' homes39. Moreover, results were unchanged when considering only the sample returning food diaries. It was not possible to directly assess energy balance measures such as energy intake or mechanisms such as eating rate due to the free-living design. To minimize participant burden, nutrient biomarkers and stable isotope analyses were not used for diet assessment; however, there are currently no validated biomarkers of UPF intake. Detailed body composition analyses such as dual X-ray absorptiometry were also not conducted. Finally, there was no processed food diet, though the smaller number and range of processed foods limits the ability to create a healthy, balanced processed food diet25. In conclusion, ad libitum 8-week MPF and UPF diets meeting UK dietary guidance resulted in weight loss, but with significantly greater reductions in weight on the MPF than on the UPF diet. These findings highlight the importance of food processing in public health policy and dietary guidance in addition to existing recommendations. The trial protocol has been published previously22. Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines42 were used to design the protocol, and reporting was according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)43. Fifty-five adults were recruited from South East England and London. Written informed consent was obtained before any screening or research-associated measurement. Inclusion criteria included any staff at University College London Hospital (UCLH), age ≥18 years, BMI between ≥25 kg m−2 and <40 kg m−2 (living with overweight or obesity), ≥50% kcal day−1 of habitual dietary intake consisting of UPF, weight stable (≤5% variation in weight in the last 3 months), medically safe to participate in a dietary intervention, able to read and write in English, willing and able to give written informed consent, able to comply with the study protocol and attend relevant inperson and online sessions and use of contraception until the end of the intervention period where necessary. Exclusion criteria included contraindication for a dietary intervention, participation in another clinical intervention trial, BMI > 40 kg m−2 or basal metabolic rate ≥2,300 kcal day−1 (to ensure intervention diets are at least 300 kcal day−1 greater than maintenance energy needs, based on excess energy intakes reported in ref. 20), diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or use of insulin, eating disorder, celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease, any dietary restrictions (for example, vegan, vegetarian, Halal or kosher requirements, diagnosed food allergy or other allergy) that limit the ability to adhere to the dietary intervention, recent commencement of medications that cause weight gain or weight loss, a history of drug or alcohol abuse, pregnancy, breast-feeding or intention to become pregnant and any other factor making the participant unsuitable in the view of investigator. On 16 June 2023, the UPF intake inclusion criterion was lowered from ≥60% to ≥50% to better reflect average UPF intake of prospective participants in South East England and London6. Participants were also asked to provide ratings of both diets after completion of the RCT (detailed below). Sealed Envelope generated the random allocation sequence. Randomization was stratified by nightshift status, sex and ethnicity. Researchers were not blind to assignment and enrolled participants. An independent statistician verified the primary outcome analysis while remaining blind to allocation assignment. All participant communications omitted the terms MPF or UPF, with diets being referred to as Diet A or Diet B. Participants were provided with an 8-week MPF diet and an 8-week UPF diet, both following EWG recommendations, in a random order, with a 4-week washout period. Participants were given all meals, snacks and drinks for both diets, which were delivered to participants' homes twice per week. The research team agreed on UPF items based on identifying ingredients of industrial use in product ingredient lists explicitly defining a product as UPF in published definitions (for example, cosmetic additives)5. Meals and snacks on the MPF diet were culinary preparations of individual ingredients (for example, raw meat, vegetables, oats, butter) ensuring correct Nova classification and no ambiguous decision on mixed dishes/shop-bought items. Diets were matched for, and followed, government recommended nutrient intakes in the EWG15,16, which focuses on specific macronutrients and food types. Guidance includes choosing foods lower in saturated fat, added sugar and salt, consuming five daily portions of fruit and vegetables, basing meals on starchy carbohydrates and eating a variety of foods in the right proportions16 (Supplementary Table 24). Menus were designed to be representative of UK diets by identifying the most commonly consumed food groups from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey41. Meals and snacks were matched across diets where possible, with a 7-day rotating menu to prevent participant boredom and sensory-specific satiety45. A patient and public involvement focus group provided feedback on the menu before the study. Menu guides were provided with instructions and pictures to prepare each meal. Participants were told to consume only the food and drink provided and to not consume any other food or drink, except water, during each 8-week diet. Minor modifications to the intervention that did not alter the overall design were acceptable for enabling adherence (for example participants were allowed to add additional herbs and spices to meals but were not allowed to use any calorie- or salt-containing condiments). Alcohol was allowed but not provided. Participants were told to keep alcohol consumption within government guidelines (≤14 weekly units)47. Participants were educated on the EWG, but no further lifestyle guidance was provided (that is, no advice on physical activity, smoking or sleep). Participants were supported during each diet through weekly calls with the research team to discuss any issues and to promote adherence. No food was provided during the 2-week baseline periods. Figure 1a outlines the study design and measurement timepoints. Age, sex, ethnicity, occupation, nightshift work pattern, educational level, marital status, medical history, medication intake, alcohol consumption, smoking habits and family history of obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes were self-reported at screening. The baseline period lasted 2 weeks to allow time to collect all data to check eligibility, including regarding habitual UPF intake with two additional nonconsecutive recalls after screening, followed by randomization and booking in the baseline visit, and then sufficient notice and time to set participants up with their first food delivery. For consistency, a 2-week assessment window was used for the baseline visit of the second diet. BIA at baseline and week 8 was conducted following an overnight fast with no alcohol intake or strenuous activity in the preceding 24 h. Assessments at week 4 were not fasted. Participants were provided with standardized wording in the week before their baseline and week 8 visits to maintain a consistent hydration status: “Please make sure that for the visit, you eat your usual diet for the 24 h before the visit day and to avoid alcohol and strenuous exercise. Please fast from 20:00 pm on the night before the study visit, and drink only water. Basal metabolic rate was estimated by the Tanita BIA scanner based on fat-free mass and participant age. Height was assessed using a stadiometer to the nearest 0.5 cm. Waist circumference was measured in centimeters using an inelastic tape measure at the iliac crest48. Estimated daily energy imbalance was assessed using the energy densities of fat mass and fat-free mass of ~9,300 kcal kg−1 and 1,100 kcal kg−1, respectively49. The mean daily energy imbalance (kcal day−1) for each participant for each diet was calculated as (9,300 × change in fat mass (kg) from baseline to week 8 + 1,100 × change in fat-free mass (kg) from baseline to week 8)/exact number of days from the start of the diet to the week 8 BIA assessment date. BP was recorded in triplicate, seated, alongside HR with an automated sphygmomanometer and oximeter. Venous blood samples were collected after an overnight fast and included glucose, HbA1c, liver function tests (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase and albumin), lipids (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, total-cholesterol-to-HDL ratio, non-HDL-C and triglycerides) and CRP. The CoEQ contains four domains: overall craving control, craving for sweet, craving for savory and positive mood and one question on perceived control over resisting a self-nominated craved food. PFS is a 15-item validated measure of hedonic appetite, food reward sensitivity and the psychological impact of living in food-abundant environments51. PFS assesses the appetite for and motivation to consume palatable foods at three levels: food available (but not physically present), food present (but not tasted) and food tasted (but not yet consumed)52. A 30-min meal test was used to assess acute changes in subjective appetite levels in the fasted and fed state at baseline and at 8 weeks. A five-item subjective appetite VAS was completed following an overnight fast. The questions capture aspects of hunger and the desire to eat: “How hungry do you feel right now?,ˮ “How sick do you feel right now?,ˮ “How much do you think you could eat right now?,ˮ “How full do you feel right now?ˮ and “How pleasant would it be to eat right now?,ˮ on a ten-point 100-mm scale, with words anchored at either end marking the extremes (“Not at allˮ and “Extremelyˮ)53. A liquid meal (187.5 ml Abbott Ensure (450 kcal, 17.5 g fat, 54.0 g carbohydrate, 19.1 g protein) was then consumed, and the subjective appetite VAS assessments were repeated at 15 and 30 min after starting the liquid meal. Baseline habitual dietary intake was assessed using Intake24 (ref. 54)—a validated, online, self-reported 24-h recall system, based on a multiple-pass recall suitable for the general population (https://intake24.co.uk)55,56. Two nonconsecutive 24-h recalls were completed at screening, baseline and at week 4 and week 8 on each diet. Food diaries were provided to record adherence to the diets and report any foods consumed off diet. Nonadherence was prespecified as consuming more than one meal per week off the provided intervention diet. Participants were encouraged to report any deviations from the provided diets and to be as honest as possible, with no repercussions. All completed and returned food diaries were analyzed. The research team provided several options and opportunities for participants to return food diaries to maximize collection, including drop off at follow-up visits or at the research center at participants' convenience during the trial. For any unreturned food diaries, participants were followed up several times to drop off food diaries at the research center at their convenience, post them at no cost or to email their food diary. MVPA was measured objectively using wGT3X-BT (ActiGraph)—an accelerometer-based activity monitor providing information on body movement using a motion sensor. The device is a reliable tool and has been used widely in clinical research given its practicality, noninvasiveness, and accuracy in measuring physical activity levels in free-living adults57. Participants were instructed to wear the device on their dominant hip continuously for 7 days, to be removed only for water-based activities. Average daily MVPA is a validated measure obtained from hip-worn accelerometers58. For data to be valid, participants must wear the device for at least 4 days with at least 10 h of daily wear time. Thereafter, the cut points proposed by Freedson et al.58 were applied to each participant's counts per minute data to derive the length of time spent in sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous and very vigorous physical activity to calculate average daily MVPA. Following completion of the RCT, participants were asked to rate both diets on a scale of 0–10, with 0 indicating a negative, poor or bland experience, or the least intensity of the attribute being evaluated, and 10 indicating a positive, excellent or flavorful experience, or the greatest intensity of the attribute being evaluated. Further details on the ratings are provided in Supplementary Table 27. AEs were recorded by the clinical research team at baseline, at 4-week and 8-week study visits and from weekly phone calls. AEs were considered related if the causal relationship between the intervention and an AE was at least a reasonable possibility, that is, the relationship could not be ruled out. Reporting of AEs and serious AEs was conducted according to the Sponsor's standard operating procedures, and updates on AEs were reported to the Trial Steering Committee and Trial Management Group. All SAEs were reported to the Sponsor within 24 h of the clinical research team becoming aware. A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee was not set up as no SAEs or notable risks were expected from participation. Incidental findings were reported to participants and their general practitioner as per written informed consent. The primary outcome was the within-participant difference in %WC between MPF and UPF diets at 8 weeks from baseline. %WC is currently used clinically in weight management clinics and across all NHS weight management programs. Prespecified secondary outcomes include changes in weight, waist circumference, BMI, body fat percentage, fat mass, fat-free mass, visceral fat rating, muscle mass, bone mass, total body water mass, total body water percentage, HR, SBP, DBP, blood markers (HbA1c, glucose, liver function tests, lipids and CRP), PFS (food available, food present, food tasted and total score), CoEQ (overall craving control, craving for sweet, craving for savory, positive mood, perceived control over resisting a self-nominated craved food), fasted and fed changes in the five-item subjective appetite VAS, dietary intake and average daily MVPA. Secondary outcomes of brain magnetic resonance imaging functional resting-state connectivity, physical function, sleep quality, mental health, quality of life and metabolomics, and results from the follow-up 6-month behavioral support program22 will be reported separately. Nonprespecified outcomes included AEs, changes in waist-to-height ratio, estimated daily energy imbalance and differences in post hoc ratings of each diet. The sample size is based on estimated within-participant variation22. The expected weight loss trajectory over 8 weeks was modeled using the National Institutes of Health bodyweight planner34 (https://www.niddk.nih.gov/bwp) and based on data from Hall et al. showing 0.9 kg weight loss following a 2-week MPF diet20, with a s.d. of the mean difference in weight change between MPF and UPF diets of 1.98 kg (mean, 1.85 kg). In total, 44 participants were required to detect a mean difference of 2.7% WC between groups, assuming weight loss on the MPF diet and no WC on the UPF diet, with a s.d. The final sample size was 55, factoring for a 20% dropout rate. Categorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages, and analyzed using χ2 tests or Fisher's exact tests where appropriate. Values are presented by randomization group and analyzed as randomized. The primary outcome analysis was prespecified as an ITT analysis, with all available data being analyzed as randomized. Any participants were included regardless of dropout status if follow-up data on the primary outcome was observed. To use all available data, any participants withdrawing from the trial were included in the ITT analysis if they provided follow-up primary outcome data for at least one of the diet interventions (that is, the minimum data required to contribute to the primary analysis). This includes participants who dropped out after completing the first-period 8-week assessment (use of the first-period data only), or participants who dropped out in the first or second period before the 8-week assessment and agreed to attend 8-week follow-up assessments for measurement of weight (use of the first- and second-period data). The ITT analysis included participants with baseline and week 8 primary outcome values for at least one diet. The PP analysis included participants with baseline and week 8 values for both diets, and no withdrawal. Mixed-effects models were used in an ITT analysis to assess the difference in %WC at 8 weeks and secondary outcomes, with a random effect for participants, and adjusting for randomization arm (including interaction with diet) and nightshift status. The primary outcome effect size with 95% CIs was then computed from the mixed-effects model using Cohen's d60. Initially, an interaction term was included in the primary outcome analysis mixed-effects model between the treatment (UPF or MPF diet) and the randomization arm (MPF/UPF or UPF/MPF) to assess any potential treatment-by-period or carryover effect. This interaction was significant (P < 0.001) and included in the mixed-effects models to account for the diet order/sequence. These were defined as the randomization stratification variables (sex, ethnicity and nightshift status selected a priori based on the literature61,62,63), as well as any baseline participant variables that were not balanced between randomization arms. Each potential participant baseline adjustment confounder identified from the prespecified criteria was added to the base mixed-effects model (the effect of diet adjusted for randomization arm, with an interaction term for diet and randomization arm and a random effect for participant). In this respect, sex, ethnicity and estimated baseline BMR were each individually not significant predictors of %WC in the mixed-effects model and did not alter the effect estimate of the ITT primary outcome analysis (see Supplementary Table 23 for the model adjustment results). These potential confounders were therefore not included in the final model. In contrast, nightshift status, when added individually, to the based mixed-effects model was a significant predictor of %WC. Unadjusted analyses of primary and secondary outcomes at 8 weeks were compared with baseline, and differences in changes from baseline to 8 weeks between diets were assessed using paired t-tests. Analyses were repeated for changes in outcomes at week 4 from baseline between diets, for changes at week 4 and week 8 from baseline between diets using repeated-measures mixed-effects models, for the PP sample, and for results using data from the first period of each randomization arm only. Carryover effects were not assessed as it is not possible to identify a carryover effect or adjust for it in a 2 × 2 crossover design43. No interim analysis was planned or conducted. The impact of missing data on the primary outcome analysis was assessed using multiple imputation with chained equations under the assumption of data missing at random. Missing data for the primary outcome were first imputed using model variables (diet, randomization arm, nightshift status and available data for %WC), and then imputed using model variables and auxiliary baseline variables (diet, randomization arm, nightshift status, available data for %WC, ethnicity, sex, occupation, education, family history of obesity, baseline estimated BMR, baseline energy intake and baseline weight). The impact of missing data on the primary outcome analysis was also assessed using inverse probability weighting. Propensity scores for receiving the treatment (MPF diet or UPF diet) were first calculated using the randomization stratification variables: sex, ethnicity and nightshift status, and baseline estimated BMR, and then calculated using randomization stratification variables and auxiliary baseline variables (randomization arm, nightshift status, available data for %WC, ethnicity, sex, occupation, education, family history of obesity, baseline estimated BMR, baseline energy intake and baseline weight). Stabilized weights were then used to reweight the remaining sample. Data were presented in tabular form using Microsoft Excel v.16.91 (24111020), figures were created using Prism 10 v.10.2.3. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. As secondary outcomes in this study are exploratory in nature, significance values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Any apparent significance of these results should be confirmed in future research. The study was registered prospectively on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05627570). All participants provided written informed consent before any screening or research-associated measurement. NHS staff at UCLH provided input to the trial design following a focus group session. Obesity Empowerment Network UK members with lived experience of obesity also contributed to the study design. One member of the trial steering committee was a lay person. Participants could consent to a lay summary of the trial results. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Nature Ecology & Evolution (2025)Cite this article More than 10 years following the onset of the sea star wasting disease (SSWD) epidemic, affecting over 20 asteroid species from Mexico to Alaska, the causative agent has been elusive. SSWD killed billions of the most susceptible species, sunflower sea stars (Pycnopodia helianthoides), initiating a trophic cascade involving unchecked urchin population growth and the widespread loss of kelp forests. Identifying the causative agent underpins the development of recovery strategies. Here we induced disease and subsequent mortality in exposure experiments using tissue extracts, coelomic fluid and effluent water from wasting sunflower sea stars, with no mortality in controls. Deep sequencing of diseased sea star coelomic fluid samples from experiments and field outbreaks revealed a dominant proportion of reads assigned to the bacterium Vibrio pectenicida. Fulfilling Koch's postulates, V. pectenicida strain FHCF-3, cultured from the coelomic fluid of a diseased sunflower sea star, caused disease and mortality in exposed sunflower sea stars, demonstrating that it is a causative agent of SSWD. This discovery will enable recovery efforts for sea stars and the ecosystems affected by their decline by facilitating culture-based experimental research and broad-scale screening for pathogen presence and abundance in the laboratory and field.

Data represents 8 individual mortalities observed in sunflower sea stars exposed to sea star wasting disease (excluding 2 individuals that were exposed but did not die). Host responses are grouped into three types, arm twisting (‘twist'), arm autotomy (‘drop') and mortality (‘mort'). Symbols indicate the average number of days post exposure when disease responses were observed. The error bars indicate 1 s.e. We confirmed the presence of V. pectenicida in the inoculum used to start this experiment using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (Supplementary Table 11). Lines indicate adjusted predicted values for stars within exposed (blue) and control (orange) treatment groups with 95% confidence intervals. Exposure methods include stars injected with coelomic fluid (‘CF'), tissue homogenate (‘homogenate'), or Vibrio pectenicida culture (‘culture'), and stars exposed to effluent water from a wasting sea stars tank (‘water'). Statistical results can be found in Supplementary Table 3. 16S rRNA gene sequences were retrieved from the SILVA rRNA gene database (version 138.1) and the NCBI nr database (as of 14 November 2024). The maximum-likelihood phylogeny was built using 1,000 replicates, and rooted with sequences from two strains of Escherichia coli (NCBI Accessions CP033092 and MT215717) as an outgroup. Values on the nodes of the phylogeny represent bootstrap values. V. pectenicida strain FHCF-3 (isolated and sequenced in this study) is highlighted in red.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Because of its remote location, the volcano presents little threat to humans. Scientists have cataloged 31 previous confirmed eruptions of Krasheninnikov throughout the current Holocene epoch, which began about 11,700 years ago. Its most recent known eruption occurred around 1550, according to the Smithsonian Institution‘s Global Volcanism Program. Large earthquakes do occasionally trigger nearby volcanic eruptions, according to the U.S. Geological Survey—but only if the volcano is already nearing an eruption, with enough magma stored inside of it undergoing high enough pressure. Another volcano in the same arc, Klyuchevskoy, is also currently erupting. Scientists watched lava fill the crater beginning in April and confirmed large amounts of fresh lava there on July 19, before the massive earthquake.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Superposition and entanglement together form the foundation of quantum computing. Being able to form entanglement between particles is crucial, as this is what allows the separate qubits to function as a system. Creating entangled pairs is an inherently fragile process, so scientists from the Harish-Chandra Research Institute in India and the Université libre de Bruxelles in Belgium wondered if there was another way to create entangled pairs rather than just from scratch. In a study published in the journal Physical Review A, the researchers walk through how an entangled qubit pair named Alice and Bob (the common couple name used for quantum thought experiments) can actually share their entangled state with a second quantum pair (named Charu and Debu). In fact, the entangled state can be transferred to an indefinite number of quantum pairs. “Given the valuable role played by the costly resource, entanglement, in quantum information processing and communication, we expect that our results will have significant impact in quantum technologies.” This means that while Charu and Debu can't form an entangled pair on their own, they can tap into the same “entanglement bank” with particles that communicated with the other entangled pair—Alice to Charu, and Bob to Debu. “We thought of a scenario where someone, like money or sweets, has a lot of it and is willing to share it with children or subordinates or just some others,” Harish-Chandra Research Institute's Ujjwal Sen told New Scientist. This metaphor is an apt one, as the original entangled pair isn't keen to give away all of its “sweets”—or, in this case, its entangled state. When entanglement passes to Charu and Debu, the pair receives a slightly smaller amount. This means that while this entanglement sharing could theoretically go on forever, it does eventually stop, because the amount of entanglement is no longer useful. While quantum computers have made slow-yet-steady progress in the last decade, their computational promise still remains out of reach—largely due to the finicky nature of qubits, as noise (thermal or otherwise) causes them to decohere.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If there ever was anything such as a poster cryptid, it would have to be Nessie (sorry Bigfoot). There is just one problem with these images—that kind of body cannot exist. Since then, version of Nessie slithering in vertical arches has been on every possible souvenir, from shirts and hats to books, postcards, mugs, stuffed animals and just about everything else imaginable. If this is the Nessie that lives rent-free in most people's minds, sightings of what was thought to be the monster should match. It turned out that most witnesses saw something completely different. Despite the stereotype, most sighting reports of what could be Nessie are missing those iconic vertical loops. Almost everyone who could have sworn they saw a monster has given an account of something explicitly unlike the arched images. Others were unclear but described something huge in the water. After investigating stacks of blurry photos and other evidence, ecologist Charles Paxton of St. Andrews University and Adrian Shine of the Loch Ness Centre came to a conclusion about what Nessie must look like if she actually exists. “This insight supports the contention that the majority of eyewitness reports are actually based on some underlying physical reality, even if not representing an actual encounter with an unknown species,” Paxton and Shine said in a study recently published in Endeavour. Nothing extant or extinct is known to have Nessie's imagined body, which features what the researchers call “vertical flexations so extreme as to show arches.” Were her pop-culturally accepted form be correct, it would actually impede the ability to swim. Marine mammals such as whales have flexible spines that allow them to swim with vertical undulations, surfacing briefly and revealing their backs, and then plunge into the deep again. While no DNA of actual sea snakes, whales, plesiosaurs and many other suspected Nessies has ever been found in Loch Ness, mental comparisons to known animals such as these may consider the way these animals briefly appear above water and the curvature of their bodies. Some sightings turned out to be nothing more than logs or boat debris, and it is plausible that multiple scraps of floating junk could give an arched impression. Paxton argues that claims of anything with multiple arches swimming in the loch is less likely to be Nessie—if she exists—than something matching the description of Nessie from most eyewitness accounts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA's largest interplanetary probe tested its radar during a Mars flyby. As it soared past Mars in March, NASA's Europa Clipper conducted a critical radar test that had been impossible to accomplish on Earth. Now that mission scientists have studied the full stream of data, they can declare success: The radar performed just as expected, bouncing and receiving signals off the region around Mars' equator without a hitch. Called REASON (Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface), the radar instrument will "see" into Europa's icy shell, which may have pockets of water inside. Every part of the instrument proved itself to do exactly what we intended." Above ground, the instrument will help to study elements of Europa's topography, such as ridges, so scientists can examine how they relate to features that REASON images beneath the surface. Europa Clipper has an unusual radar setup for an interplanetary spacecraft: REASON uses two pairs of slender antennas that jut out from the solar arrays, spanning a distance of about 58 feet (17.6 meters). Those arrays themselves are huge -- from tip to tip, the size of a basketball court -- so they can catch as much light as possible at Europa, which gets about 1/25th the sunlight as Earth. During development, engineers at the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California even took the work outdoors, using open-air towers on a plateau above JPL to stretch out and test engineering models of the instrument's spindly high-frequency and more compact very-high-frequency antennas. But once the actual flight hardware was built, it needed to be kept sterile and could be tested only in an enclosed area. But it also presented opportunities to calibrate the spacecraft's infrared camera and perform a dry run of the radar instrument over terrain NASA scientists have been studying for decades. As Europa Clipper zipped by the volcanic plains of the Red Planet -- starting at 3,100 miles (5,000 kilometers) down to 550 miles (884 kilometers) above the surface -- REASON sent and received radio waves for about 40 minutes. All told, engineers were able to collect 60 gigabytes of rich data from the instrument. Almost immediately, they could tell REASON was working well. "The engineers were excited that their test worked so perfectly," said JPL's Trina Ray, Europa Clipper deputy science manager. Europa Clipper's total journey to reach the icy moon will be about 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers) and includes one more gravity assist -- using Earth -- in 2026. Europa Clipper's three main science objectives are to determine the thickness of the moon's icy shell and its interactions with the ocean below, to investigate its composition, and to characterize its geology. The mission's detailed exploration of Europa will help scientists better understand the astrobiological potential for habitable worlds beyond our planet. NASA's Launch Services Program, based at NASA Kennedy, managed the launch service for the Europa Clipper spacecraft. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some butterflies can smell others of the same species, allowing them to identify each other in areas where multiple species all look the same, new research finds. For example, researchers found that in glasswing butterflies, even the most closely related species produce different pheromones, indicating that they can smell others of the same species. Given that all of these butterflies look the same to teach birds that they are all toxic, this allows the butterflies to find a compatible mate. Butterflies are used in conservation as an indicator species, meaning they are used to track and monitor the levels of biodiversity and other insects in an area. Glasswing (Ithomiine) butterflies are found across Central and South America and make up a substantial part of the butterfly species found there, making them good indicators of biodiversity in incredibly biodiverse areas, like the Amazon rainforest. However, there are over 400 species of glasswing butterfly, and all species in an area look incredibly similar to discourage birds from eating them, with coloring that implies they are toxic. Additionally, glasswing butterflies can undergo rapid radiation, where many new species arise from the same ancestor in a short period of time. By genetically mapping these butterflies, the team highlighted that six subspecies were more genetically distinct than previously thought, leading to them being classified as new individual species. Also, understanding the species from a genomic perspective enables experts to highlight any visual differences that could be used to identify and track the different species, now that they are confirmed as genetically distinct. The team also investigated if the genomes held clues as to why these butterflies had so many species, and what allowed them to develop so quickly. These chromosomal rearrangements have knock-on effects when it comes to mating. In order to reproduce, butterflies must produce eggs and sperm, but this relies on the butterfly's chromosomes lining up. This means that if two butterflies with different chromosomal rearrangements mated, their offspring would be sterile because they would be unable to produce sperm or eggs. The researchers suggest that the high level of chromosomal rearrangement in these butterflies is key to their ability to rapidly form new species, as once a population changes its chromosome number and thus forms its own species, it can more quickly adapt to different altitudes or host plants. Why they have such high levels of rearrangements remains a mystery and is something the scientists are working to uncover. Understanding rapid radiation in insects could have implications for conservation research, understanding how species adapt to climate change, as well as possible implications for agriculture and pest control. Dr Eva van der Heijden, first author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the University of Cambridge, said: "Glasswing butterflies are an incredibly adaptive group of insects that have been valuable in ecology research for around 150 years. However, until now, there was no genetic resource that allowed us to robustly identify different species, and it is difficult to monitor and track something that you can't identify easily. Dr Caroline Bacquet, senior author at the Universidad Regional Amazónica Ikiam in Ecuador, said: "Having the reference genomes for the two groups of glasswing butterflies, Mechanitis and Melinaea, allowed us to take a closer look at how they have adapted to life in such close proximity to their relatives. These butterflies share the responsibility of warding off predators by displaying similar colour patterns, and by producing different pheromones they can successfully find mates and reproduce. Now that we have clarity on glasswing butterfly species, we can look for specific markings or differences between them, giving new ways to track them during fieldwork." Dr Joana Meier, senior author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: "We are in the middle of an extinction crisis and understanding how new species evolve, and evolve quickly in some cases, is important for preserving species.

(2025)Cite this article Wood is formed as plants expand in thickness through radial growth, which initiates after apical growth. At the onset of radial growth, dormant procambial cells in the vasculature become active and act as bifacial cambium stem cells, which produce xylem (wood) inward and phloem outward. Cytokinin has been implicated in radial growth initiation; however, its precise mechanisms, especially at the cellular level, remain unclear. Here we show a switching mechanism of radial growth, in which a cytokinin response maximum (CRM) transiently appearing in roots beyond the meristem induces stem cell activation. Manipulation of the CRM revealed that procambial cells primarily retain phloem differentiation competence but newly acquire xylem differentiation and self-renewal capabilities upon experiencing the CRM. Transcriptome analysis and mathematical modelling showed that the CRM is driven by cytokinin production and subsequent positive and negative signalling feedback loops. Our findings therefore demonstrate that a dynamic hormone response establishes multipotent stem cells de novo by providing proper competences to undifferentiated cells arising from the meristematic tissue, enabling the post-embryonic growth transition. This mechanism may serve as the basis for the vitality of plants, which continue to grow vigorously even after embryogenesis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mass General Brigham investigators led a nationwide study that found that financial hardship, food insecurity, lack of healthcare access, and other social risk factors are linked to higher risks of long COVID. Although in recent years researchers have gained greater insight into the prevalence, symptoms and effects of long COVID through the longitudinal Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, social risk factors for developing long COVID remain incompletely understood. In a new analysis of the RECOVER-Adult cohort, Mass General Brigham researchers found a two- to three-times higher risk of long COVID in those with social risk factors, including financial hardship, food insecurity, experiences of medical discrimination, and skipped medical care due to cost. "During the pandemic, we saw the overwhelming role that social risk factors played in determining who was infected with COVID-19 and what the severity and mortality from disease was," said lead author Candace Feldman, MD, MPH, ScD, of the Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation and Immunity at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. "We wanted to understand whether those risk factors also play a significant role in the longer-term, chronic symptoms that can affect people months and even years after SARS-CoV-2 infection." They also used ZIP code data to study area-level measures of risk, like household crowding. After adjusting for variables including hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection (as a marker of disease severity), vaccination history, pregnancy status, age, sex, race and ethnicity, the researchers found significant associations between nearly all the individual-level social risk factors studied and increased risk of developing long COVID. There was a significantly higher burden of social risk factors among racially or ethnically minoritized groups. However, the researchers found that social risk factors appeared to affect white, Black and Hispanic people's risks of long COVID similarly. "As with other chronic diseases, many different parts of people's social environment influence long COVID risk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JWST observations of light sources before the first galaxies should have formed are raising new questions about our galactic origins Since its launch in late 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has been glimpsing some of the earliest epochs of cosmic time. And now some of the telescope's farthest observations yet have revealed sources of blue ultraviolet light from an epoch when stars shouldn't have existed yet. The observations indicate nine new light sources, with six at redshift 17 and three at redshift 25, when the universe was only 200 million to 100 million years old. He is lead author of a preprint paper reporting the findings that has been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal. “If we confirm that they are truly at those redshifts, the universe was much, much more active its first 200 million years” than astronomers had thought, Pérez-González says.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. If accurate, the newly sighted objects don't merely expand the timeline of galaxy formation back to a much earlier period; they sit in direct conflict with astronomers' best cosmological models of when stars began to form during the cosmic dawn. Their preprint paper has been accepted for publication in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. In other words, it's possible that the first objects to bathe the early universe in light were not stars but rather hungry black holes that burst into existence mere seconds after the big bang itself. This phenomenon is what astrophysicists refer to as redshift. Before JWST, the highest confirmed redshifted galaxy astronomers had observed was at redshift 9, when the universe was 600 million to 500 million years old. For the first couple of years after its launch, JWST spent a significant amount of its time confirming previously identified galaxies that had been observed by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). But after the summer of 2022, as JWST began revealing galactic candidates at earlier epochs, astronomers started to realize something wasn't quite making sense. “JWST is finding too many too massive galaxies too early in the universe,” says astrophysicist Allison Kirkpatrick of the University of Kansas, who specializes in galaxy evolution and was not involved in the new studies. “So the idea here was to go beyond that, to redshift 15 and beyond,” Pérez-González says, "in search of the very first galaxies ever formed.” His team's report of nine new objects at even higher redshifts will need confirmation. To determine whether the objects are as far as they seem to be, astronomers must break up their light into specific wavelengths in a process called spectroscopy. Drawing on data collected by JWST's Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) over two imaging surveys, Pérez-González and his team identified the new candidate galaxies from a pool of more than 80,000. Casting a wide net means their sample is less likely to be biased before they zoom in on the most interesting distant objects. The problem with this scenario, however, is that galaxy evolution models have an extremely tough time producing stars at such early stages of the universe's development. It's doubtful that this time frame would have allowed enough time for gas to cool and gather into clouds large enough to gravitationally collapse into the first generation of stars. “Galaxies cannot form quickly because the gas in the early universe is very hot, preventing it from collapsing into galaxies and stars,” Kirkpatrick says. To get around this problem, Ferrara and his collaborators propose that primordial black holes—a distinct population of black holes that may have emerged in the first few seconds after the big bang—were consuming gas in the early universe. This feeding frenzy could have released light that we are now detecting with JWST at periods before the first stars formed. Typically, black holes form when massive stars collapse after they run out of fuel or when a large cloud of gas directly collapses in on itself, bypassing the stellar phase. “What we are proposing is that primordial black holes formed less than one second to five seconds after the big bang,” Ferrara says. “These have been essentially there forever, from the beginning.” Initially, these black holes would have started out small, “no larger than the size of an atom,” Kirkpatrick says. Scientists think that within the first second of the universe as we know it bursting into existence, a rapid period of expansion, known as inflation, caused space to increase in size by 35 orders of magnitude, equivalent to an atom stretching to the size of the solar system. Although starting out tiny, after 100 million years, these black holes may have swelled to 10,000 times the mass of the sun, Ferrara and his team suspect. One way to distinguish if these light sources are primordial black holes or first-generation stars would be to look at the sizes of galaxies. If they appear more pointlike, then the primordial black hole explanation would make more sense because a massive black hole is still tiny compared with a whole galaxy. So maybe 30 percent of them are consistent with what a primordial black hole might look like," Pérez-González says. “Our pictures of the CMB maps are still a little bit too blurred in order to see the fine-structure details that primordial black holes may have introduced,” Ferrara says. For now, a definitive answer is just beyond reach. “We haven't yet proved how the first supermassive black hole seeds form, and this could be one pathway. It would help resolve some of the tension with JWST observations and cosmological models,” Kirkpatrick says. “We have to be careful because maybe these galaxies could turn out to be contaminants or lower-redshift galaxies or something else.” But whether these mysterious black beacons outshone the first stars is a question we may soon have an answer to.

Notwithstanding the substantial advancements in e-skin research and related applications with collaborative robots and bionic prostheses, biomimetic intelligence remains a challenge in the attempt to understand and mimic somatosensory processing schemes. In this work, we present a large-area e-skin embedded with photonic fibre Bragg gratings, capable of decoding touch localization through a bioinspired two-layered spiking neuronal network. The implemented biomimicry of slowly adapting and fast-adapting type II primary afferents, cuneate neurons with overlapping receptive fields and neuroplasticity, enable unsupervised learning in localizing tactile stimuli with an error lower than 10 mm, and two-point discrimination thresholds matching human psychophysical thresholds in the forearm. These results align with biological findings and offer a promising step towards the development of bionic systems, opening new avenues for both practical applications and scientific explorations of somatosensation. The tactile sense is essential to perceive and process information about the surroundings, allowing humans to establish social interactions, locate and react to external stimuli, and recognize features of what is being touched1,2,3,4,5. In addition, touch is fundamental for body preservation, through the identification and localization of innocuous contact events and harmful stimuli, enabling dexterity with fine control of touching behaviours and preventing damages and accidents3,6. This abundance of tactile information reflects the variety of tactile receptors that populate the human skin. Mechanical stimuli are, in fact, encoded by four main classes of primary afferents (PAs), also known as mechanoreceptors, that innervate glabrous skin. These mechanoreceptors are distinguished according to their adaptation to different stimuli. Slowly adapting receptors have a sustained response during the overall duration of the stimulus, whereas rapidly adapting receptors respond primarily to transients, such as the beginning or the end of an applied mechanical stimulus2,7,8. In addition, mechanoreceptors can be classified into two classes according to their location within the layers of the human skin. Type I mechanoreceptors present small receptive fields and are located near the epidermal surface. Among them, there are Merkel discs and Meissner corpuscles, which are slowly adapting type I (SAI) and fast-adapting type I (FAI) units, respectively. Conversely, Ruffini and Pacinian corpuscles are classified as slowly adapting type II (SAII) and fast-adapting type II (FAII) receptors, respectively, being located deeply in the dermis and having large receptive fields with obscure borders2,9,10. The cooperation of all these receptors fosters a human's ability to recognize and localize light and heavy touch, sustained pressure, vibrations, textures and fine features. The artificial implementation of these functionalities would be desirable in both industrial and biomedical applications in which awareness of the surroundings is a major requirement. As an example, collaborative robots need to interact safely with the environment and humans in various scenarios11,12,13, and users of bionic prostheses or exoskeletons would benefit from enhanced tactile information for a better embodiment and control of the artifacts14,15,16. Thus, the development of biomimetic tactile systems, enriched by a thorough understanding of somatosensory learning mechanisms, would make it possible to equip robots with sensing devices capable of generalizing and adapting to new stimuli and develop more intuitive functional bionic devices for the restoration of sensory channels14,17,18. These needs have driven numerous research studies and the development of tactile sensors, based on electronic technologies, such as piezoresistive and capacitive elements, to implement bioinspired artificial skins3,11,17,19,20. Nevertheless, the deployment of these systems is still limited since they do not feature either the physiological skin shape flexibility and sensitivity distribution, given their rigid substrates and wiring issues, or the natural mechanism of efficient tactile information decoding4,11,13,21. Recently, fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors have proven to be a viable alternative for developing bioinspired e-skins, owing to their multiplexing properties, that is, the possibility to distribute multiple sensing units along a single optical fibre11,22. FBGs deeply placed in a silicone layer resembling human skin were proven to functionally mimic Ruffini mechanoreceptors, enabling the decoding of stimuli applied onto the e-skin by means of supervised learning methods11. However, biomimetic intelligence and the efficiency of somatosensory processing are still lacking in these systems, possibly because these biological mechanisms have not been completely and thoroughly understood yet21,23,24,25. Currently, several models of tactile processing are based on analogies with vision due to its spatial accuracy21,26. However, touch sense mechanisms also present high temporal precision, with sensitivity to different frequency ranges, as it happens in the auditory system21,23,27,28. Recently, two bioinspired models have been proposed in tactile somatosensory computing for the classification of textures29 and edge orientation30. These models implemented a PA spike-time-dependent synaptic learning and a functional organization of the receptive fields of the higher processing structures inspired by the cuneate nucleus and somatosensory cortex, respectively. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no artificial biomimetic models in the literature that combine both paradigms—temporal and spatial precision—of the somatosensory system to localize tactile stimuli applied onto a large-area e-skin, grounding on the functional organization of overlapping receptive fields and on neuroplasticity dependent on the temporal precision of the signals originating from the PAs9,24,31,32,33,34. Here we propose that a bioinspired sensory model, based on PAs and cuneate neurons (CNs), could infer the localization of mechanical indentations applied to a large-area e-skin, which resembles the human forearm and integrates photonic FBGs as transducers. Our approach is grounded on the hypothesis that the temporal to spatial conversion of tactile stimuli from the upper limb occurs in the cuneate nucleus9. This conversion is accomplished by coding the convergent and divergent patterns of PAs in CNs9,21,32. According to this model, it can be assumed that the cuneate nucleus is the first integration stage of the peripheral tactile inputs, and this integration enables the classification of tactile stimuli by the higher processing structures, such as the somatosensory cortex9,21,32,35, distributing the computational burden throughout the afferent pathways. The implementation of a model inspired by the biological PA–CN architecture in combination with a biomimetic large-area e-skin aims at artificially mimicking, to some extent, the natural sensory pathways, providing an engineering tool to support investigations on the neurophysiology of the human sense of touch. The objective of this work was to develop a biomimetic intelligent tactile device based on bioinspired e-skin and two-layered spiking neuronal network (SNN) to localize indentations applied onto the e-skin (Fig. To this end, we first fabricated a curved, soft e-skin embedding 21 FBGs, whose receptive fields were accessed to evaluate its intrinsic sensitivity (Fig. The wavelength variations of the sensors, collected via an automatized force-controlled indentation protocol (Methods), were then processed through a model consisting of two neuronal layers. The first layer is based on first-order neurons that mimic type II mechanoreceptors of the human skin. The spiking output of these neurons is then conveyed to the second network layer, inspired by the cuneate nucleus intracellular dynamics through 1,036 functionally organized secondary neurons (CNs) and interneurons (INs)18,29 (Methods). To evaluate the proposed model, trained via a synaptic learning protocol based on calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity29, and consistent with the assumption that the tactile information is spatially interpreted in the cuneate nucleus9, we estimated the location of indentations applied onto the e-skin from the spiking activity of the implemented secondary neurons. In addition, we assessed the model features through comparisons with biological systems. a, Two-layer SNN for the localization of stimuli onto the e-skin. The first layer is composed of 126 PAs that mimic type II mechanoreceptors (SAII and FAII). These PAs make excitatory synapses with both CNs (coloured filled triangles and dots) and inhibitory INs (coloured empty triangles). The INs convey inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSP) to the CNs (red, empty triangles). Both CNs and INs form the second layer of the network. The weights of the second-order neurons are trained through a calcium-dependent (CADP) synaptic rule. b, Large and overlapping receptive fields, with marked sensitive hotspots (dark blue), of three FBG sensors of the e-skin, mimicking type II PAs. The developed artificial skin embedded 21 FBG sensors in a polymeric substrate to smoothly transmit the applied external loads to the optical sensors. The distribution of the optical sensing units was inspired by that of human mechanoreceptors in the forearm, with a higher density near the wrist11,36,37. In addition, the FBGs in the silicone substrate were arranged to somehow resemble the functional role of type II mechanoreceptors. Located deep in the dermis, these receptors present large overlapping receptive fields with different sizes and sensitivities and smooth borders7,37. The characterization of e-skin sensitivity, through the normalization of the FBG wavelength variations in response to quasi-static indentations (Methods), demonstrated that the sensor receptive fields resemble those of type II mechanoreceptors, exhibiting large receptive fields with a single marked hotspot and sensitivity overlapping with the neighbouring transducers (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. Given the functional similarity of the FBGs to type II mechanoreceptors, the first neuronal layer of the SNN was conceived to emulate SAII and FAII PAs. Hence, each sensor output was multiplied by a matrix of gains (Extended Data Table 1) and fed as an input current to six first-order neurons, four SAIIs and two FAIIs, consistent with the biological ratio among the density of type II mechanoreceptor families36, totalling 126 PAs (Methods). This architecture enabled the translation of the FBG wavelength variations (Δλ; Fig. 2b) and their derivatives (Fig. 2c), which scale with the indentation stimulus (Fig. 2a), into spike responses, generated through the regular spiking Izhikevich's neuron model (Fig. As the Ruffini endings encode skin stretches and show a sustained response to skin indentation2,39,40, the raw Δλ signals (Fig. The resulting firing rate was proportional to the applied load, which plateaus when stationary forces occur (Fig. The Δλ first temporal derivatives (Fig. 2c) were, instead, the sensory input to FAII afferents, since the Pacinian corpuscles encode transient tactile stimuli, that is, loading and unloading states (Fig. It is worth noticing that the behaviour of the SAII units (Fig. 2e) is valuable to decode contact intensity information, in line with biological hypotheses41. We also observed a discharge activity for high loads (greater than 3.5 N), as it happens in biological systems (Fig. As expected, we demonstrated that the average interspike intervals (ISIs) for each force range decrease with a higher intensity of the stimuli. 2h; Pearson correlation coefficient, ρ = 0.99; linear fitting polynomial: log[SAIIFiring Rate] = –0.38 Hz/N × log[Stimulus intensity, %] + 1.41 Hz; R2 = 0.98; average SAII firing rates and ISI in Supplementary Table 1), consistent with the results of the characterization of SAII units of the hairy skin of mammals, as it is that of the human forearm43. In addition, considering the dynamics of the mechanical indentations applied to the e-skin, the ISI range (approximately 50–100 ms) is consistent with neurophysiological findings43. a, Stimulus applied onto the e-skin during an indentation. Force values are recorded by means of a load cell attached to the end-effector of the indenting robot. b, Response of the 21 FBG sensors. c, First derivative of the FBG sensor signals. d, Spiking activity of the modelled SAII and FAII grouped by gain (Gi) value. e, Firing rate of the active SAII of the SNN. f, Firing rate of the active FAII of the SNN. g, SAII firing rate distributions per force-level range (0.25–4.25 N, with a step of 0.5 N) for the dataset of 1,846 indentations. The median of each distribution is indicated by a solid green line within the box, whose black edges represent the first and third quartiles (values are reported in Supplementary Table 1); the whiskers extend to 1.5 times the IQR beyond the quartile boundaries. h, Relationship between stimulus intensity percentage and SAII ISI. The two parameters are expressed in the logarithmic scale. The second layer of the proposed SNN was designated to emulate the cuneate nucleus intracellular dynamics. It was composed of 1,036 functionally organized CNs and INs, each of the latter making an inhibitory synaptic connection with a CN (Fig. Biologically speaking, the CNs present complex receptive fields that, in general, are larger than that of PAs and comprise both excitatory and inhibitory subfields44. This enables sensitivity to specific spatial characteristics, allowing them to perform the spatial computation of tactile stimuli24,30,31. In addition, the cuneate nucleus has a functional somatotopic organization that may contribute to human tactile discrimination ability33,45,46. To provide our network model with these peculiar features, we defined the CN receptive fields, designed to include at least 12 PAs belonging to a specific region of the e-skin. Physiologically, convergent PAs with overlapping receptive fields, as it is in our system, determine larger secondary receptive fields44. Hence, each CN receives projections from the included PAs and these PAs could also establish connections with other secondary neurons, whose receptive field includes them. This connectivity entails that neighbour CNs have overlapping receptive fields, consistent with biological findings, according to which these overlaps are argued to implement input-feature segregation32. This approach generated a somatotopic map of the e-skin (Methods). All the 126 PAs were provided to the 1,036 CNs as excitatory (wexc,i) and inhibitory (winh) synapses (Fig. The initial inhibitory weights winh were equal to 0.125 for all the implemented CNs29. A synaptic learning protocol based on calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity with a gradual synaptic weight transformation at each tactile stimulus presentation was performed (Methods). The post-learning excitatory synaptic weights and the evolution of the excitatory weights for one training fold are presented in Fig. The post-learning inhibitory synaptic weights are represented in Fig. It is worth noticing that the final winh values were close to 0 for all the CNs. This behaviour occurred because the update of winh values, which are responsible for regulating the firing rate of the CN calcium channels, was performed with a moving average of the firing rate of the last five indentation presentations, to avoid instability (Methods). Additionally, in the proposed SNN, most CNs should be silent depending on the site of the stimulus applied onto the e-skin, resulting in both low activity of the calcium channels and small winh. In general, the slowly adapting PAs had a greater potentiation (that is, increase) in their synaptic weights, especially in the case of SAIIs with higher firing activities (gains G3 and G4; Fig. The implemented synaptic learning rule potentiated the PA synapses that had high correlation with the CN total calcium activity. Therefore, the PA synapses with firing behaviour synchronized with the PAs having higher initial excitatory synaptic weights are more susceptible to potentiation of their synaptic weight18,29. This explains the substantial weight increase in SAIIs, given that the indentation task with plateaus (Fig. 2a) resulted in a higher firing rate for these afferents (Fig. a, Initial excitatory weights generated from the CN receptive fields considering a heuristic rule. b, Final excitatory weights. c, Difference between the final and initial excitatory weights. d, Final inhibitory weights of the 1,036 CNs. The spiking activity of 1,036 CNs was assessed for each indentation sample. 4b) was found to be qualitatively related to the force applied to the e-skin (Fig. The somatotopic maps in Fig. 4c show the spatial cumulative activations of the CNs during 1 s for two different loading conditions, that is, the first (~0.4 N) and the second (~2.3 N) level of the indentation force profile (Fig. It can be observed that the active area enlarges for higher stimulus intensities, with greater spiking activities inside the receptive field of the stimulated CN (Fig. This behaviour was also quantitatively demonstrated by grouping the CN responses of the whole indentation dataset by the force level, resulting in median numbers of active CNs of 329 (interquartile range (IQR) = [116, 450.75]) and 545 (IQR = [481, 685]) for the first and second force levels, respectively (Fig. 4d), with significant differences between the two loading conditions (Mann–Whitney U-test, P value = 0). In addition, as the applied load increases, the CN spiking activity intensifies with a monotonic increasing trend, consistent with the findings of studies on mammals (Extended Data Fig. In line with physiology, the modelled CNs presented bursting behaviours, reaching instantaneous spiking frequencies of nearly 1 kHz, where the increasing firing rate was supposed to encode the intensity of the stimulus24,32,48,49. In conclusion, it can be argued that both CN spatial activation on the modelled somatotopic map, provided by progressively recruiting PAs as the contact area increases32, and their spiking firing rates encode the intensity of the applied stimulus, consistent with neurophysiological findings on touch encoding50. b, Spiking activity of the 1,036 CNs of the SNN second layer. c, Somatotopic maps of the CN activations (cumulative spike numbers over 1 s of stimulus) for the two force levels of the sample indentation in a. d, Distributions of the number of active CNs at the two force levels for 1,655 indentations. Figure 5 illustrates the neural activity of the CNs organized in the e-skin somatotopic map, the estimated locations weighted by the neural activity of the second-order neurons (weighted location) and the actual indentation site, for some indentations applied to different e-skin regions. We also report simulations of the real-time response of the model in terms of the weighted location estimation within a moving window (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2), evidencing its generalization capability. For each sample indentation, the CN somatotopic map with neuron activations (left) and target and estimated location of the stimulus on the e-skin and error d, that is, Euclidean distance, between them (right) are shown. We then calculated the location prediction error as the Euclidean distance between the weighted and target stimulus sites for all the indentation test points (Fig. The fourfold cross-validation resulted in a median location prediction error of 36.26 mm (IQR = [20.46 mm, 52.14 mm]) and 14.11 mm (IQR = [7.47 mm, 28.56 mm]) before and after the learning process, respectively (Supplementary Table 3 and Fig. Our results and the consistency of the prediction error achieved across the four folds (Supplementary Table 3) show that the proposed model is robust and has a high learning capability. In addition, we estimated contact positions through a simpler approach involving the calculation of the weighted average of the FBG Δλ (Methods). This resulted in a median error of 15.72 mm (IQR = [9.40 mm, 28.82 mm]) for the whole e-skin surface (Extended Data Fig. 3 shows a few prediction examples). The prediction errors of the different approaches for different regions of interest (ROIs) are represented in Fig. 6c (error values are listed in Supplementary Table 4). In general, this analysis resulted in larger localization errors at the edges of the e-skin. Conversely, the e-skin central region (ROI radius ≤ 45 mm), that is, the area with a higher density of sensors and in which the receptive fields of the CNs entirely map onto the e-skin surface, showed a median prediction error smaller than 10 mm for the SNN approach (Fig. In the same region, the estimation of the contact position through the weighted average of the FBG signals resulted, instead, in larger median errors and higher variability (Fig. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SNN approach for stimulus localization and its consistency with neurophysiological findings about the forearm tactile acuity (10–18 mm)51,52. Then, we investigated the temporal resolution of the developed spiking architecture for stimulus localization. After 10 ms from the onset of contact, the neuronal network was able to reach a median localization error of 14.36 mm (IQR = [8.17 mm, 25.24 mm]), which is similar to that achieved when considering longer time windows, such as 2 s (14.05 mm, IQR = [7.45 mm, 28.70 mm], Mann–Whitney U-test, P value = 0.51; Extended Data Fig. These outcomes are consistent with some neurophysiological hypotheses on the dispersion of the latency (~14–28 ms) of stimulus transmission from the hand mechanoreceptors to the cuneate nucleus9. a, Test indentation points of the fourfold cross-validation randomly distributed over the e-skin. b, Prediction error, that is, Euclidean distance, of the contact location over the e-skin area. c, Median and IQR values of the prediction errors of the SNN before and after synaptic learning, and the FBG weighted average for different ROI radii. d, Topographic latency map for one contact point in the two-point discrimination analysis. e, Topographic latency map for two contact points in the two-point discrimination analysis. f, Piecewise sigmoid fitting of the two-point detection rate as a function of the distance between the two probes used in the Weber two-point discrimination test. The two-point discrimination threshold (th) of the e-skin is reported, too. To demonstrate the generalization features of the SNN in localizing tactile stimuli onto the e-skin, the Weber two-point discrimination test was conducted using custom probes with tips at distances ranging from 0 mm to 60 mm (Supplementary Video 3). The analysis of the latency of the CN spiking responses resulted in a topographic map in which the minima were searched and identified as contact points. The latency maps for a single point and a 50-mm two-point indentation trial are represented in Fig. The detection rates for each probe distance were computed (Supplementary Table 5) and a piecewise logistic curve was fitted to the data to determine the psychometric relationship (Fig. 6f; parameters a = 0.53, b = 0.35 mm−1, c = 35.26 mm and d = 0.27; Methods). The two-point discrimination threshold, that is, the probe distance value corresponding to a psychometric probability of 0.75, yielded 42.25 mm, consistent with neurophysiological findings on the discrimination of pairs of contacts on the human forearm (~30–45 mm)53,54. This study investigated how a bioinspired SNN can decode tactile stimuli applied onto a biomimetic large-area e-skin, embedding FBG transducers in a soft polymeric substrate, starting from the hypothesis that the first stage of spatiotemporal decoding of tactile information occurs at the cuneate nucleus32. We attempted to functionally emulate the first- and second-order neurons of the somatosensory system, to further achieve its computational and learning efficiency. To this aim, we first developed a forearm-shaped e-skin, whose sensor arrangement and receptive fields were intended to morphologically mimic type II mechanoreceptors of the human skin (Fig. Physiologically, the human arm has a tactile innervation density of 12 units cm−2 (ref. 36), which results in approximately 1,800 PA innervation distributed over an area of 150 cm2 (the approximate e-skin area), with hundreds of PAs sending projections onto a single CN9. Considering this, the artificial morphological reproduction of the tactile decoding channels is still a challenge, given the current technological limitations of most sensing systems that prevent the development of extremely sensor-dense devices4,18,21,55. Our approach benefited from the high integrability and multiplexing of FBG sensors and leveraged on the modelling of six sensory afferents per FBG. Through the proposed calibration of the Izhikevich model of regular spiking neurons38,56,57,58,59, the resulting 126 PAs recreated a variety of firing dynamics, mimicking fast and slowly adapting mechanoreceptors, whose activity encoded stimulus transients and intensities, respectively (Fig. Inspired by physiology, the CNs were designed to have large overlapping receptive fields, thereby realizing a somatotopic map of the e-skin. This spatial organization in combination with the unsupervised learning rule, based on the CN intracellular dynamics and a heuristic initialization of the synaptic excitatory weights (Fig. 3), were paramount for the localization of tactile stimuli through the spiking activity of the secondary neurons18,29,32,44. Our SNN model was proven to be effective in estimating the indentation location under varying conditions of force and position (Fig. 5), with a median error of about 14 mm and less than 10 mm in the central region of the e-skin (Fig. Physiologically, the human ability of stimulus localization and tactile acuity are enhanced in body regions with a higher density of mechanoreceptors, such as the fingers36,60. Despite the low density of sensors in the e-skin, our SNN allowed to reach results consistent with neurophysiological findings51,52, with median errors and variability lower than those directly obtained from the FBG signals on the considered ROIs through a non-bioinspired approach (Fig. Additionally, our model intrinsically enabled discrimination between two contact points without any further training, an outcome that was enabled by the implemented bioinspired learning paradigm, confirming the generalization properties of our SNN. The model two-point discrimination threshold of about 42 mm aligns with that of the human forearm53,54 and conforms to the theory of convergence of PAs with broad receptive fields44 (Fig. The stimulus localization on the e-skin was enabled by both CN topographic organization and firing activity (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. Spatiotemporal coding strategies were also observed in regions of the somatosensory cortex61 and hypothesized to occur even at the cuneate-nucleus level9. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 2), in line with evidence on mammals47 and with the hypotheses that input-feature segregation may occur in the cuneate nucleus24,32,48,49. This study, thus, demonstrates that the bioinspired design of both e-skin and two-layered SNN, supported by biological findings, enabled the unsupervised learning of skin-contact localization over large areas with the feasibility of generalization to more complex stimuli. This outcome can offer both technological and scientific applicability. First, this achievement supports the perspective of transferring our approach to real-world applications, such as bionics and robotics. Tactile feedback could be provided to persons with disabilities, such as prosthesis users or quadriplegic subjects, by means of either invasive intraneural or intracortical stimulation or non-invasive wearable interfaces62. The restoration of the disrupted sensory pathways should elicit natural sensations, for which intuitive and biomimetic feedback is required63,64. Although our bioinspired e-skin holds a huge potential for integration in bionic devices, given its mechanical conformability and its robustness to unstructured setting interferences, the bulkiness of the optoelectronic interrogator prevented its applicability in real sensory restoration architectures so far. However, the recent advancements of miniaturized photonics will boost the deployment of FBG-based e-skin in bionics, promising major breakthroughs in the near future65,66. Considering the robotics scenarios of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, the implementation of biomimetic intelligence, in combination with large-area e-skins on machines, is essential for safe interactions with the surroundings4,11,13,67. The new generation of robots should autonomously navigate and operate in unstructured environments and cooperate with humans in various workspaces, ranging from industrial production to medical and rehabilitation care11,68,69,70. For most applications, collaborative machines require a spatial resolution of 10–40 mm (ref. 71), which is consistent with the performance of our system. The artificial emulation of the natural tactile sensory pathways in robots could foster human-like responsiveness and enable more efficient computations and hardware resource usage, as that in biological systems13. In addition, biomimetic e-skins are promising for the integration of non-invasive sensory feedback interfaces, which could enhance safety and collaborative tasks in the telepresence and teleoperation frameworks72. In these scenarios, where intuitiveness and efficiency are required73, our system entails a huge potential for real-time deployment, given its architecture based on event-driven processing. Online implementation of soft neuromorphic models has been demonstrated to be feasible via the Euler method, selecting the discretization timing in the millisecond scale to guarantee the convergence of artificial neurons firing in the order of tens of hertz typical of the human somatosensory system, in a trade-off between the overall accuracy and convergence and the computational burden74. In addition, the ongoing advancements of neuromorphic hardware solutions hold promise to surpass the powerful, but costly, conventional electronics of deep learning accelerators13,75. Future works will target the on-chip deployment of our SNN, aiming at parallel energy-efficient hardware architectural processing instead of algorithmic implementations. Regarding the contribution to neuroscientific research, in this work, we provided modelling evidence supporting, to some extent, the plausible hypothesis that the cuneate nucleus is the first stage of tactile information interpretation, through overlapping receptive fields and the capacity to convert spatiotemporal spiking codes of the PAs into spatiotemporal features and functionalities, tasks previously attributed mainly to the somatosensory cortex31,32,34,76. Nevertheless, the functional role of the cuneate nucleus in somatosensory processing is not yet fully understood, due to the complexity of performing intracellular recordings in this structure77,78. Our model, as an open-access neurocomputational machine intelligence tool79, can serve as an engineering enabler for the investigation of second-order neuron functions. It offers tools to evaluate the functional effect of neuronal architectures applied to electrophysiological recordings that may be available in future investigations of the somatosensory system, with particular reference to the encoding of stimulus intensity and localization by second-order neurons. The experimented e-skin (Extended Data Fig. 5) had size and shape similar to those of the human forearm. To mimic biomechanical compliance, a soft silicone polymer (Dragon Skin 10 medium, Smooth-On) was used to realize a flexible patch to embed an optical fibre with 21 FBG sensors. It was fabricated by a three-step process11: (1) a first silicone pouring in a custom mould to obtain a bottom layer with a groove; (2) the embedding of the fibre along the grooved path; (3) a second silicone pouring to cover the fibre itself and provide robustness to the patch. The e-skin was then attached to a custom three-dimensionally printed plastic support to guarantee stability. The optically sensitive elements were FBGs (length, 10 mm) distributed along the designed path running throughout the e-skin resemble the sensitivity features of the human forearm, that is, with an increasing density from the proximal to distal parts. These gratings are interference patterns inscribed within the core of a single optical fibre. When broadband spectrum light, sent by means of an optoelectronic interrogator, passes through the fibre cable and hits an FBG, it is partly back-reflected to the input point, as a spectral peak centred at a characteristic wavelength, λB: where neff is the effective refractive index of the optical fibre and Λ is the pitch of the specific grating80. The λB value of the e-skin FBGs were, hence, defined by fabrication and ranged between 1,520 nm and 1,580 nm with a step of 3 nm. Wavelength shifts occur when a deformation is applied to the sensor11, thereby allowing the encoding of tactile stimuli. Considering this feature and to reduce the effects of potential prestrains that could have impacted the residual deformability of the sensors in response to external tactile stimuli, the FBGs were arranged on straight fibre segments. The training and validation of the proposed model required the collection of a dataset of indentations applied over the e-skin surface. For this purpose, an automatized indentation protocol was executed, with 1,846 target points to touch, computed as the centroids of the triangles of a random mesh of the skin surface. A bimanual robotic platform, consisting of two anthropomorphic arms (Racer-5-0.80, Comau), was programmed to cooperate during the indentation protocol (Extended Data Fig. 5): one robot performed the tactile tasks, whereas the other held and oriented the e-skin. The indenting robot reached each target site perpendicularly, touching the skin with a spring-like hemispherical probe attached to the end-effector. Force feedback measured by means of a load cell (Nano 43, ATI Industrial Automation), mounted at the base of the indenter, was provided to control the robot to release the contact when exceeding a threshold (2.5 N) and then fly to a new target point. The control code consisted of dedicated routines (LabVIEW, National Instruments) running on both an industrial controller (IC-3173, National Instruments), to send commands to the robots, and a PC, for managing and checking the experiments. During the indentation sessions, force and FBG signals, the latter read by means of an optical interrogator (FBG Scan 904, FBGS Technologies), were collected at a 100-Hz rate, and saved into text files together with the Cartesian coordinates of the contact sites. The receptive fields of the FBG sensors populating the skin were represented as two-dimensional contour maps depicting the spatial distribution of sensitivity to contact force. Hotspot regions in dark blue indicate the maximum sensitivity (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. To obtain the FBG receptive fields, the wavelength variation signals (Δλ) from each FBG sensor were averaged over 500 ms captured on the highest force plateau, that is, the second force level, and divided by its average value. The obtained results were then normalized with respect to the highest FBG sensitivity value, to have sensitivity maps ranging from 0 to 1. This procedure was performed using all the available indentation samples. Each sensor signal was resampled at a frequency of 1 kHz to establish a regular firing dynamics consistent with the discretization of the Izhikevich neuronal model74. The absolute values of both raw and differentiated signals were calculated to feed the Izhikevich neurons as input current I, to mimic the adaptation dynamics and firing response of type II mechanoreceptors, that is, Ruffini endings (SAII) and Pacini corpuscles (FAII)38. To simulate the physiology of type II PAs in terms of the ratio between slowly and fast-adapting units, that is, two SAIIs to one FAII36, their diverse sensitivity and the different-sized overlapping receptive fields, the raw absolute FBG signals and their derivatives were multiplied by four and two distinct gains. Hence, six mechanoreceptor models were considered for each FBG sensor (Fig. 2), resulting in 126 input currents for the first-order neuron models. Extended Data Table 1 shows the gains used for the SAII and FAII models. The SAII gains were selected through some pilot tests and empirical analyses, where we assessed whether the increase in gain was generating an increase in the firing rate within the physiological range documented in the literature43. Specifically, the average ISIs (that is, the inverse of the average firing rates) corresponding to each force range were computed, and their logarithmic values were fitted to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity percentage (force values normalized by the maximum of 4 N; Fig. The results were then compared with background neurophysiological findings43, particularly to the ISI characterization of SAII units. The FAII gains were selected following the same empirical approach, that is, by evaluating the spiking activity at load transients. It is worth noticing that a general procedure for establishing the gains of the input currents of the Izhikevich model for artificial mechanoreceptor simulation has not yet been established in the literature. Thus, several studies, such as ref. 58, reported this empirical method of gain selection according to the specific application. The Izhikevich model consists of a system of differential equations that can be solved via the Euler method74. where A, B, and C are standard variables of the Izhikevich model; t represents time; a is the timescale of u; b is the sensitivity of u to the membrane potential; c is the membrane resting potential value; and d modulates the dynamics of the after-spike reset of the recovery variable u. For the implemented mechanoreceptors, we choose the parameters Gainn (Extended Data Table 1) that reproduced a regular firing behaviour. The activity of type II mechanoreceptors was analysed to investigate relationships with the intensity of the applied load. For this purpose, the perpendicular force profile was extracted for all the 1,846 indentations. For each indentation, SAII and FAII units were considered separately. First, their corresponding firing rates were calculated on moving time windows of 100 ms, with an overlap of 50 ms. For each window, the firing rate was extracted as follows: where the subscript X indicates the type of mechanoreceptor (SAII or FAII), wt is the duration of the time window, NspikesX is the number of spikes of the X units in wt and NneuronXactive is the number of active neurons of each type in the selected window. The resulting firing rates were compared with the corresponding force profile (Fig. Then, the SAII firing rates were grouped for force levels, ranging from 0 to 4 N, with a step of 0.5 N. The corresponding distributions were analysed and the relevant statistics computed (median values and first and third quartiles; Fig. For each load-intensity level, the mean SAII firing rate value was extracted to further derive the relationship with the applied loads. For that, the linear Pearson correlation coefficient ρ was calculated. The second layer of the SNN was composed of 1,036 CNs, modelled with the mathematical implementation based on the exponential integrate-and-fire approach29. This model reproduces the complete dynamics of the membrane potential of CNs, as described in equation (5), along with a detailed modelling of the activity of low-threshold voltage-gated calcium channels and calcium-activated potassium channels: In equation (5), Cm is the capacitance of the neural membrane; Vm is the CN membrane potential; IL is the leak current of the neuron (equation (6)); Ispike is the spike current that recreates the action potential onset and the fast neuron depolarization (equation (7)); Iion is the ionic current resulting from the summation of the currents of voltage-gated calcium channels (ICa) and calcium-activated potassium channels (IK; equation (8)); Iext is the external current that can be injected into the neuron (in this study, it is equal to 0); and Isyn is the synaptic current (equation (9)), where each synapse (i) is activated by a PA. where wexc,i is the excitatory synaptic weight; t* is the time at which a spike occurs and winh is the inhibitory synaptic weight. Isyn can be, hence, expressed as the sum of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents of all the synapses of the individual PAs. The definitions of the other variables and their respective values are reported in Supplementary Table 6. The current ICa is described by equation (10) and the current IK, by equation (11): where \({\bar{g}}_{{{\rm{Ca}}}}\) and \({\bar{g}}_{{\rm{K}}}\) are the maximum conductance; ECa and EK are the action potentials of the calcium and potassium channels, respectively; and xCa,a, xCa,i, \({x}_{{{\rm{K}}}_{{{\rm{Ca}}}}}\) and \({x}_{{{\rm{K}}}_{{{\rm{V}}_{\rm{m}}}}}\) are the activity states of the channels. These values are provided in Supplementary Table 6. In this model, both ion channels (xCa,a and xCa,i) are considered as sources of the membrane calcium concentration of the CN ([Ca2+]). Thus, we proposed that the activity of the total neuron calcium concentration follows equation (12). The relevant parameters are reported in Supplementary Table 2. To functionally mimic the organization of the cuneate nucleus, we generated an e-skin grid mesh with 29 × 38 edges, that is, 28 × 37 subregions. In this mesh, each subregion represented a CN, and its centroid represented the centre of its receptive field. In total, 1,036 CNs were created with circular overlapping receptive fields of 41.67-mm radius each. The criterion for the definition of the size of the CN receptive field was to include at least two FBG sensors in the corresponding sensitive area of the e-skin and, thus, 12 PAs, consistent with the number of dominant PAs that project into a CN found in neurophysiological studies on mammals and simulations of human tactile perception24. This approach allowed us to determine a CN somatotopic map of the e-skin. In our model, each of the 1,036 CNs was fully connected to the 126 PAs, with excitatory weights ranging from 0 to 1, and to a single inhibitory synapse (Fig. 1a, red triangle), with an IN that grouped the responses of all the 126 PA projections (Fig. This connectivity enabled the potentiation or depression of all the synaptic weights during the learning process. In this model, the magnitude of the postsynaptic potential projected into a CN for a given sensory input is dependent on both excitatory (wexc,i) and inhibitory (winh) weights, as described in equation (9)18,29. Then, the obtained values were rescaled between 0.2 and 1. The initial excitatory weights (wexc) of the PAs corresponding to the sensors outside the area of the CN receptive fields were instead set to 0 (Fig. In this way, only the mechanoreceptors inside the CN receptive field region had initial weights greater than 0 (Fig. All the inhibitory synaptic weights (winh) were instead initialized to 0.125. Inspired by calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity, we implemented a synaptic learning process29, where the total inhibitory weights (winh) and presynaptic excitatory weights (wexc,i) were updated at each stimulus presentation. According to our model, the excitatory weight potentiation of the presynaptic neurons (PAs) occurred when the total calcium activity (\({A}_{{{\rm{Tot}}}}^{{{{\rm{Ca}}}}^{2+}}\)) of the CN, as in equation (13), was strongly correlated with the local calcium activity (\({A}_{{{\rm{Loc}}}_{i}}^{{{{\rm{Ca}}}}^{2+}}\)) of a synapse (PA with the secondary neuron; equation (14)); otherwise, this synapse was depressed: where \({A}_{{Tot}}^{{{Ca}}^{2+}}\) is the total calcium activity of the CN; kact = 1 is an arbitrary constant; \({A}_{\rm{Loc}_{i}}^{{\rm{Ca}}^{2+}}\) is the local calcium activity due to a synapse i; τr = 4 ms is the rise time; τd = 12.5 ms is the decay time; τl = 0 ms is the latency time; τl = 21 ms is a constant to calculate the ratio; and t* is the time at which a PA spike occurs. To reach supralinearity in the local calcium activity, we used an approximative approach of subtracting an offset, that is, the 75% of the single-pulse activation peak activity, from the local calcium signal, and this resulting value was used as the local calcium activity (\({A}_{{{\rm{Loc}}}}^{{{{\rm{Ca}}}}^{2+}}\)), as proposed in ref. In the model, the individual excitatory weights actualization occurred during the presentation of each stimulus during the learning phase, and it is described as the integral of the correlation between local calcium activity (\({A}_{\rm{Loc}}^{{\rm{Ca}}^{2+}}\)) and total calcium activity (\({A}_{\rm{Tot}}^{{\rm{Ca}}^{2+}}\)), following equation (15): where \({{{\rm{Avg}}}}_{{A}_{{\mathrm{tot}}}^{{{\mathrm{Ca}}}^{2+}}}\) is the average of the last three values of the total calcium activity; SynEQ is the synaptic equilibrium defined as a linear function of the total excitatory synaptic weight with a dual slope having point 0 in 10 (decay = 0.04, if ∑wexc < SynEQ; decay = 0.12, if ∑wexc > SynEQ); and K is a constant gain factor defined by the sigmoid function represented in equation (16), with a gain step on the slope of 0.005. To avoid instabilities in synaptic learning, it was necessary to average the calcium activity; thus, the learning threshold was obtained by multiplying the average of the total calcium activity \({{\rm{Avg}}}_{{A}_{{\mathrm{tot}}}^{{{\mathrm{Ca}}}^{2+}}}\) by the synaptic equilibrium SynEQ. Although the inhibitory synaptic learning is based on the firing rate of the CN calcium channels, winh, initially set to 0.125, is responsible for regulating the total activity of the calcium channels in the CN. Thus, the low activity of calcium channels was counteracted with a decrease in winh, and vice versa. For the model implemented in this work, winh was used to maintain the firing frequency of the calcium channels at a predefined set point of 20 Hz, and the update of winh was given by a dual-slope function zeroing at this set point. The synaptic learning protocol is summarized in a pseudo-code in the Supplementary Text. The synaptic learning process was evaluated through a fourfold validation, such that for each training fold, 1,385 indentation samples were shuffled and presented to the model, thereby totalling 1,385 training cycles. In this step, only 1 s of data was used, including the beginning of the second indentation step (that is, the highest force level for each indentation). These data were the spikes (binary vector) of the first neuronal layer of mechanoreceptors (PAs). All the synaptic learning processes were separately performed for each of the 1,036 CNs. After the synaptic learning, the spike responses of 1,036 CNs were calculated for the indentations of each validation fold and processed to derive the stimulus intensity and location information. To demonstrate the increase in CN spiking activity when progressively higher loads were applied, the cumulative spike numbers inside the receptive field of the stimulated CN were computed for different loading conditions (Extended Data Fig. To this aim, we evaluated the CN spikes in a 1-s window at the beginning of each of the two plateaus of the indentation force profile. In addition, the spatial activations of the CNs for the different force levels were explored. In this regard, the number of active CNs was calculated for the two load conditions and 1,655 of the applied indentations (Fig. A Mann–Whitney U-test test with a 0.05 significance level was performed to investigate whether the spatially distributed responses of the CNs could encode information on different intensities of the applied tactile stimuli. The sum of each neuron spike (Nspki) was then used for the weighted location estimation, as described in equation (17). where WLx,y is the location estimation in the skin x–y plane (considering the two-dimensional projection of the e-skin surface) weighted by the neural activation of the CNs (weighted position); Nspki is the number of spikes of a neuron in a time window; i is the CN ID (from 1 to 1,036); and NiLocx,y is the position of the centroid of a second-order neuron in the x–y plane of the modelled functionally organized cuneate nucleus. We estimated the weighted location on a 1-s sliding window with an overlap of 100 ms. To evaluate the location prediction error, we calculated the Euclidean distance between the real position of the indentation on the e-skin and the estimated weighted location (Fig. In addition, we compared the localization performance of the SNN with those achieved through the weighted average of the 21 FBG sensor wavelengths (FBG WLx,y), calculated as follows: where Δλi and (xFBG, yFBG)i are the wavelength variation and two-dimensional coordinates of the ith FBG sensor, respectively. The FBG-based weighted average was computed for each timestamp of the corresponding non-zero force values. Then, the average location and Euclidean distance were calculated to obtain a single estimation and a single error value per indentation of the test sets of the four folds (Extended Data Fig. The performance of both neuronal network and FBG weighted average in localizing the test stimuli were also assessed considering ROIs of different sizes. Starting from the centre of the skin, circular areas with an increasing radius-delimited (from 20 mm to 55 mm) portions of the e-skin surface were used to compute the contact estimation error, considering that all the test indentations fell inside the circular region. Median and IQR error values were calculated for each region size, grouping the results of the four cross-validation folds (Fig. We then evaluated the temporal resolution of our system to localize the applied indentations. 2a–c), we estimated the minimum amount of time needed by the trained SNN to reach its best localization performance. This approach aimed at investigating the stimulus conduction time from the simulated forearm mechanoreceptors, that is, the FBG sensors, to the modelled CNs, designated to localize contacts onto the e-skin. We computed the model localization error (median and IQR) on the second step of the force profile on time windows of different lengths, ranging from 10 ms to 2 s, the latter being the duration of the complete second level of the force profile. The two extreme conditions were statistically compared with a level of significance (α) of 0.05. To apply two-point stimuli onto the e-skin through the two-point discrimination test (Supplementary Video 3), a set of custom probes was designed (Fusion 360, Autodesk) and three-dimensionally printed in polylactic acid (Ultimaker S5). The probes featured one or two hemispherical tips (radius, 1.5 mm) with distances ranging from 20 mm to 60 mm, with a step of 5 mm. Each probe was attached to a handle stick by means of a conical spring fixed to a sliding structure, which provided the tool with a translational perpendicular degree of freedom. This structure presented a blocking mechanism so that the tool could be pushed until bottoming out, allowing to control the applied force. Ten experimenters participated in the trials, which consisted of manually indenting the e-skin by means of each of the above-mentioned probes in seven random locations. The single-probe trials were repeated before each of those with two-tip probes. At each indentation, the experimenter had to gently land on the e-skin with the probe, stabilize the posture, push the tool until the descent was not blocked and keep it for 3 s. The protocol instructions and the timing of the different indentation phases were displayed via a custom graphical user interface developed in LabVIEW 2019 (National Instruments). The same software routine allowed us to store the FBG sensor signals, collected by means of an optical interrogator (FBG Scan 904, FBGS Technologies), the corresponding timestamps and the trial information into text files for further analysis. A Δλ threshold of 0.003 nm was considered to identify the onset of the contact, that is, when at least one sensor signal exceeded it for 200 ms. This corresponded to the beginning of the landing phase. Then, to identify the onset of indentation, a second threshold, that is, twice the average absolute wavelength of all the sensors during the 1 s after the e-skin was touched, was considered. The start of the stimulus corresponded to the moment when the mean value of all the FBG Δλ values exceeded this threshold for at least 500 ms. The resulting indentation portions were zero padded with 500-ms periods to simulate the transition from non-contact to contact states. Given the variability of indentations performed manually by the experimenters, some trials were discarded (Supplementary Table 5). Then, the neuronal response latency was determined within a 200-ms temporal window starting from the first CN spike. These latencies were organized topographically (Fig. 6d,e); hence, a 3 × 3 Gaussian spatial filter (σ = 0.5) was applied. The lowest minimum in the resulting latency map was identified as the first contact point. Then, the occurrence of a second minimum was checked outside a circular region corresponding to the size of the CN receptive field44. If two distinct minima were found following this criterion, it was determined that two contact points were applied to the e-skin. The two-point detection rates were then estimated for all the trials, and a psychometric curve was fitted to them. The resulting piecewise logistic function had the following expression: Finally, the 0.75 probability, that is, when F(x) was 0.75, was considered to determine the e-skin two-point discrimination threshold (Fig. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The scientists then plucked nuclei from these gene-edited cells and injected them into egg cells from a domestic dog to form clones. Ancient proteins rewrite the rhino family tree — are dinosaurs next? Ancient proteins rewrite the rhino family tree — are dinosaurs next? “I don't think they de-extincted anything,” says Jeanne Loring, a stem-cell biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. Colossal, meanwhile, has taken an increasingly combative tone in addressing criticisms, issuing rapid rebuttals to researchers and conservationists who have publicly questioned the company's work. The company denies having played any part in this. “We have had this attitude of running towards critics, not away,” says Ben Lamm, a technology entrepreneur and co-founder of the company. De-extinction is an emerging field that represents the meeting point of several groundbreaking biotechnologies: ancient genomics, cloning and genome editing, ostensibly in the service of conservation. And Michael Crichton's 1990 novel Jurassic Park — itself inspired by ancient-DNA investigations — popularized the possibility that long-dead organisms could be cloned from preserved DNA. There has never been perfect agreement on what counts as de-extinction — such as whether it means cloning exact replicas of extinct species, creating proxies that fulfil their roles in ecosystems, or something in between. The animal's genome was transferred into goat (Capra hircus) egg cells from frozen cell samples taken from one of the last living bucardo specimens in 2000. But this pathway to de-extinction isn't an option for most species. The advent of CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing in 2012 provided another option. Researchers can identify genetic variants that contribute to key traits of extinct animals and edit these variants into cells of living relatives. They can then use that manipulated DNA to create a new animal through cloning. Plans to bring back animals such as the passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) and the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) began to flourish. “We had been unable to get really any philanthropic interest in de-extinction,” says Ben Novak, who leads a passenger-pigeon de-extinction effort at the non-profit organization Revive & Restore in Sausalito, California. He teamed up with Lamm to launch Colossal Biosciences with US$15 million in funding, much of which came from venture capitalists. Beth Shapiro joined US firm Colossal Biosciences in 2024 to focus on de-extinction work.Credit: Shelby Tauber/The Washington Post/Getty Beth Shapiro, an evolutionary geneticist who is chief scientific officer at Colossal, was initially sceptical that there was a strong conservation argument for creating elephants that had key mammoth traits. In 2015, she told Nature that her book on de-extinction, called How To Clone A Mammoth, might have been more accurately titled ‘How One Might Go About Cloning a Mammoth (Should It Become Technically Possible, And If It Were, In Fact, a Good Idea, Which It's Probably Not)'. Shapiro turned down an offer to join the company at first, but started seriously entertaining the idea when Colossal expanded its de-extinction ambitions. She was especially interested in seeing de-extinction technologies applied to existing endangered species. The company, now valued at around US$10 billion, has attracted celebrity investors, including the media personality Paris Hilton and film director Peter Jackson, alongside a handful of leading scientists as staff and advisers. The dire-wolf project was different from many of Colossal's other efforts because it proceeded quietly. Few people knew about the work until this year, and that irked some researchers. “They didn't invite any kind of conversation about whether or not that is a good use of funds or a good project to do,” says Novak. She also says that the company talked extensively to scientists, conservationists and others about the project and how it should proceed. Fifteen of the changes were identified in two dire-wolf genomes obtained from the remains of animals that lived 13,000 and 72,000 years ago. “There is no chance in hell a dire wolf is going to look like that,” says Tom Gilbert, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Copenhagen and a scientific adviser to Colossal. He says he agrees with other scientists who have argued that, on the basis of what is known about the dire wolf's range, it “basically would have looked like a slightly larger coyote”. Colossal notes that the coat colour is based on the discovery of variants in two dire-wolf genomes that it says would have resulted in light-coloured fur. According to an update from Colossal in late June, Romulus and Remus weigh around 40 kilograms, around 20% heavier than a standard grey wolf of the same age, and Khaleesi is about 16 kilograms. They live on an 800-hectare ecological preserve surrounded by a 3-metre wall. She nevertheless considers the dire wolves to be an example of de-extinction, and says that creating them will have conservation benefits for wolves and other species. A group of experts on canids that advises the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) issued a statement in mid-April rejecting Colossal's claim that gene-edited wolves could be considered dire wolves, or even proxies for the extinct species. Gilbert, who was a co-author of a preprint describing the ancient dire-wolf genomes2, says he is concerned that Colossal is not being sufficiently clear to the public about what it has done. “If you're putting out descriptions that are going to be so easily falsified, the risk is you do damage to science's reputation.” The Tasmanian tiger or thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) was a carnivorous marsupial that once roamed Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea. Lamm rejects the idea that Colossal's messaging undermines public credibility in science, pointing to what he says was an overwhelmingly positive reaction. It has, she says, changed her views on how to repopulate northern white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum cottoni). But she worries that Colossal's messaging overshadows those contributions. “It may create an opportunity for us to educate the public,” she says. “More often, it creates an opportunity for us to be ignored.” “It makes me a little bit sad there is this huge debate and angry voices about the common name,” he says. Shapiro says she was surprised and saddened by the strength of reactions to Colossal's announcement. Ancient proteins rewrite the rhino family tree — are dinosaurs next?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Current therapies consist of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which can be effective but often have limited success and significant side effects. In a new study of oral cancer, a type of HNSCC, they demonstrate how precisely timing two different treatments can potentially improve treatment outcomes by protecting tumor-draining lymph nodes, which are located close to tumors and have an important role in mediating the immune system's response to the tumor. The study's results could have significant implications for the treatment of HNSCC, as well as other cancers that are resistant or unresponsive to current standard treatment approaches. The research also provides valuable biological insight into the role of tumor-draining lymph nodes in cancer biology, which could have further implications for developing new therapies. The researchers are now conducting clinical trials in collaboration with investigators at Providence Earl Chiles Cancer Center to leverage these strategies to improve outcomes in head and neck cancer patients.
