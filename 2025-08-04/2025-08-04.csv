            The Israeli government voted unanimously on Monday to fire the country's Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara.
    


            “The government has just unanimously approved the proposal of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice Yariv Levin to immediately terminate the tenure of Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara,” according to Levin's spokesperson.
    


            Baharav-Miara has often been criticised by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who accused her of abusing her authority to undermine the government's policies and destabilize Israel's rule of law.
    


            Right-wing Israeli politicians have long called for her dismissal.
    


            Israel's Supreme Court issued an injunction on Monday to stop Baharav-Miara's firing. Levin's move in March to initiate proceedings to dismiss her sparked fierce criticism and a legal challenge.
    


            The attorney general's role in Israel holds unique authority, serving as both the government's legal adviser and a public watchdog. The position is not a political appointment tied to the ruling coalition – something the government has been trying to change as part of its controversial judicial overhaul.

            The brazen partisan redistricting underway in Texas, with Republicans attempting to entrench themselves in office and Democrats weighing a counter-offensive in blue states, was greenlit by the US Supreme Court six years ago.
    


            Chief Justice John Roberts, in an opinion for a 5-4 court, declared that federal judges could not review extreme partisan gerrymanders to determine if they violated constitutional rights.
    


            Roberts' opinion reversed cases that would have allowed such districts – drawn to advantage one political party over another irrespective of voters' interests – to be challenged as violations of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech and association and the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection.
    


            The justices split among the familiar ideological lines, with the five conservatives ruling against partisan gerrymanders and the four liberals dissenting.
    


            “Of all times to abandon the Court's duty to declare the law, this was not the one,” dissenting justices warned in 2019, “The practices challenged in these cases imperil our system of government. Part of the Court's role in that system is to defend its foundations. None is more important than free and fair elections.”
    


            That decision in Rucho v. Common Cause has generated a new era of partisan rivalry with vast repercussions for American democracy. The decision resonates as profoundly as the Roberts Court's decision last year in Trump v. United States, which granted presidents substantial immunity from criminal prosecution (also delivered among partisan lines).
    


            Trump has taken the 2024 ruling as a blank check, tearing through democratic norms.
    


            The gerrymandering case also lifted a federal guardrail. Lawsuits challenging extreme partisan gerrymanders can still be brought before state court judges. But state laws vary widely in their protections for redistricting practices and state judges differ in their ability to police the thorny political process.
    


The Supreme Court gave Trump immunity. He's  using it as a blank check.



            Roberts may have failed to foresee the consequences in 2019 and then in 2024. Or, alternatively, perhaps he understood and simply believed the effects were not properly the concern of the federal judiciary.
    


            In his opinion, Roberts acknowledged the apparent unfairness of gerrymandered districts.



            “Excessive partisanship in districting leads to results that reasonably seem unjust,” he wrote. But, he said, “the fact that such gerrymandering is ‘incompatible with democratic principles,' … does not mean that the solution lies with the federal judiciary.”
    


            The chief justice said no constitutional authority exists for judges to oversee the politics of redistricting, nor are there standards for their decisions, that is, to know when state lawmakers have gone too far in what is an inherently political process.
    


            Roberts wrote: “‘How much is too much?' At what point does permissible partisanship become unconstitutional?”
    


            The current redistricting controversy arises from Trump's pressure on fellow Republicans to generate as many GOP-controlled districts as possible before the 2026 midterm elections for the US House of Representatives.
    


            Right now, the focus is on Texas where legislators broke from the usual cycle of post-census redistricting that happens every 10 years and suddenly proposed a new map intended to push several Democrats out of office and buttress the chances that Republicans keep their majority, now hanging by a thread, in Congress.
    


            The audacious Texas effort has prompted liberals to consider a counterattack in Democratic-controlled states such as California to create new maps that could boost their numbers.
    


            But politicians' effort to draw lines to their advantage have never been free of controversy.
    


            The paired cases before the justices six years ago involved extreme gerrymanders by Republicans in North Carolina and by Democrats in Maryland.
    


            Roberts was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, whose vote was crucial. A year earlier, Kavanaugh had succeeded Justice Anthony Kennedy, who had previously left the door open to federal court challenges to partisan gerrymanders.
    


            Justice Elena Kagan, taking the lead for dissenters, insisted workable standards existed and had been used by lower US court judges.
    


            “For the first time ever, this Court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond judicial capabilities. And not just any constitutional violation,” she wrote, pointing up the stakes.
    


            “The partisan gerrymanders in these cases deprived citizens of the most fundamental of their constitutional rights: the rights to participate equally in the political process, to join with others to advance political beliefs, and to choose their political representatives,” Kagan added.
    


            She was joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who remains on the bench, and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in 2020, and Stephen Breyer, who retired in 2022.
    


            Echoing a line from redistricting precedent that appears apt as Texas legislators divide voters for predetermined results, Kagan wrote that a core principle of government is “that the voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.”

            Hot Stocks 





            Tesla's board is giving CEO Elon Musk another huge pay day.
    


            The company's latest CEO pay package, worth about $29 billion, comes several months after a Delaware court rejected for a second time Musk's 2018 performance award following a shareholder lawsuit. Musk is currently appealing the order.
    


            In an letter to shareholders Monday, Tesla said that Musk has “not received meaningful compensation for eight years” and that its “legal efforts continue” to reinstate the 2018 pay package, adding that there's “no clear timeline for resolution.”
    


            The package would give Musk 96 million shares of Tesla, each of which trades at just over $300. Musk would have to pay $23.34 for each of those shares, equal to the amount he was expected to pay when he was first awarded his 2018 compensation package.
    


            “Despite these legal challenges, we can all agree that Elon has delivered the transformative and unprecedented growth that was required to earn all milestones of the 2018 CEO Performance Award,” wrote board members Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson.  “This growth has translated into immense value generated for Tesla and all our shareholders.”
    


            Musk is not paid a cash salary or bonus for working at Tesla. Rather, Musk, one of the world's richest people, makes his money through lucrative packages of stock options that allow him to purchase millions of Tesla shares for a fraction of their market price. Musk is Tesla's largest individual shareholder — he owns about 13% of the company.
    


            The CEO caught the ire of many shareholders last year and earlier in 2025, however, when he shifted his focus to politics, spending huge sums of money and time trying to get Republican candidates elected for office. Musk was largely successful in his efforts, but his entry into politics backfired on Tesla.
    


            Political opponents have protested at Tesla dealerships throughout the year, and the company's sales have been falling sharply. President Donald Trump's domestic policy agenda also strips Tesla and other EV makers of tax incentive for vehicle sales and regulatory credits from other automakers – a major driver of Tesla's revenue.
    


            Shares of Tesla (TSLA) have fallen 25% this year. The stock rose nearly 3% in premarket trading.
    


            However, Musk has recently said he would return to his companies full time – a demand many shareholders had made of the CEO, given his considerable track record for success in the past. Monday's pay package keeps Musk at the helm of the struggling company.
    


            Musk has recently tried to remake Tesla, focusing the company on AI and robotics, shifting away from its reliance on car sales.
    


            “Through Elon's unique vision and leadership, Tesla is transitioning from its role as a leader in the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to grow towards becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services,” the pair wrote.
    


            Tesla is currently in the midst of rolling out its much-publicized robotaxi service, albeit in a much slimmed down fashion than Musk promised a few years ago.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Trump announces new date for Witkoff Moscow visit","https://www.rt.com/news/622444-witkoff-visit-moscow-trump/","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 03:00:00 GMT","

 US President Donald Trump has confirmed that his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will visit Moscow “next week,” just days before his 10-day ultimatum for Russia to reach a peace agreement with Ukraine expires.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump said the trip would “likely” take place on Wednesday or Thursday, after a previously announced visit over the weekend did not occur. He did not elaborate on Witkoff's full schedule but indicated that the envoy's mission was focused on bringing about a ceasefire.

“Yeah, get a deal where people stop getting killed,” Trump said, when asked what message Witkoff would deliver to Russian officials and whether Moscow could do anything at this point to avoid new sanctions.

“Well, there'll be sanctions, but they seem to be pretty good at avoiding sanctions. You know, they are wily characters, and they're pretty good at avoiding sanctions,” he added.

The US president claimed that Moscow had “asked” for Witkoff's visit, but the Kremlin has yet to comment on the reports.

Trump's remarks come amid his growing frustration with Russia over the ongoing Ukraine conflict, which he had pledged to resolve within 24 hours upon returning to office.

Last week, he shortened his original 50-day window for peace talks to just ten days, warning that failure to reach a settlement by August 8 would trigger harsh penalties, including potential 100% tariffs and so-called “secondary sanctions” targeting Russia's remaining trade partners, such as China and India.

The White House has not disclosed whether Witkoff is expected to meet directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two men have previously held multiple meetings in Moscow, though diplomatic progress has remained elusive.

Russia has repeatedly expressed willingness to engage in talks but maintains that any peace agreement must reflect “new territorial realities.” Speaking on Friday, Putin reiterated that Moscow's conditions – including Ukrainian neutrality and renouncing NATO aspirations – remain unchanged.

Moscow views the Ukraine conflict as a Western-orchestrated proxy war and has accused Washington of trying to dictate peace terms while continuing to arm Kiev. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has downplayed Trump's threat of new sanctions, noting that Russia has developed an “immunity” after years of economic restrictions.

South Korea has begun dismantling loudspeakers along the border with North Korea, Yonhap News Agency reported on Monday, citing the country's Defense Ministry. The move comes weeks after both sides agreed to halt propaganda broadcasts as part of a broader effort to ease tensions on the peninsula.

Removing the equipment reflects a broader diplomatic shift under South Korea's new president, Lee Jae-myung, who has signaled an intention to reduce friction with Pyongyang. Despite signs of improvement, the two Koreas technically remain at war, as the 1953 armistice was never replaced by a formal peace treaty.

“It is a practical measure that can help ease inter-Korean tensions without affecting the military's readiness posture,” the ministry said.

Large-scale loudspeaker arrays, installed by Seoul decades ago, were periodically used to blare K-pop music, news bulletins, and anti-regime messages across the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas. Pyongyang often responded with its own broadcasts or by sending balloons filled with propaganda leaflets and bags of trash over the border, drawing protests from the South.

Relations between the two countries sharply deteriorated under the previous South Korean administration. In July 2024, Seoul resumed the loudspeaker campaign after a six-year pause, in response to Pyongyang's launch of trash-filled balloons into the South. The tensions were sparked in part by North Korean anger over leaflets sent by defectors in the South.

At the same time, Seoul continued to bolster military preparedness by conducting joint drills with the US. Pyongyang condemned the exercises as rehearsals for invasion and responded with a series of missile tests.

Despite recent signs of renewed diplomacy, the South still maintains a defensive posture toward the North. Last week, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun and his US counterpart, Marco Rubio, reiterated their commitment to the denuclearization of North Korea, suggesting that dialogue remains a priority for regional stability.

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has accused the United States of having “helped stage a coup” in Brazil and condemned what he described as Washington's attempt to use political pressure to impose economic punishment on his country.

Speaking at a Workers' Party event in Brasília on Sunday, Lula warned that Brazil would not accept unequal treatment and is ready to defend its interests on the global stage.

“Trying to use a political issue to economically sanction us is unacceptable,” Lula said, referring to recent US threats to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian exports.

“I won't forget that they have already helped stage a coup here,” Lula added. He did not clarify whether he was referring to Operation Brother Sam in 1964, the 2016 impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff, or the recent attempt by ex-president Jair Bolsonaro to overturn the 2022 election results.

US President Donald Trump linked the tariff threat to what he called a “witch hunt” against the “highly respected” Bolsonaro, who stands accused of attempting a coup to stay in power. Washington has also imposed sanctions on Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing an inquiry into the alleged plot.

Lula stressed that Brazil is no longer economically dependent on the United States, citing expanded global trade ties and stronger domestic fundamentals. He also reaffirmed his push for an alternative to the US dollar in international commerce.

“They want to end multilateralism… They want to go back to country-to-country deals where the big dominate the small,” Lula said. “In other words, a small country negotiating with the United States is like a factory worker with 80,000 coworkers negotiating alone with the boss. The agreement is lopsided; you won't gain anything.”

“We have size, we have posture, we have strategic and economic interests… We want to negotiate, but we want to negotiate on equal terms,” he added.

At 50%, Brazil would face the highest US import tariff globally. In addition, Trump has previously threatened an extra 10% tariff against BRICS members, accusing them of trying to “destroy the dollar as the global standard.”

Brazil is a founding member of BRICS, formed in 2006 with Russia, India, and China. The bloc has since expanded to include South Africa, Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates, and Indonesia. Its leaders have consistently stated they have no intention of weakening the dollar, arguing that Washington itself undermines it through political misuse.

Georgia congresswoman declared in an interview that she feels the GOP has lost touch with its base

Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of the most prominent voices in Donald Trump's Maga movement, has declared in an interview that she feels that the Republican party has lost touch with its base, and suggested she may abandon the party entirely.

The Georgia congresswoman told the Daily Mail this week she was questioning whether she still belongs in the Republican fold and expressed resounding frustration with GOP leadership.

“I don't know if the Republican party is leaving me, or if I'm kind of not relating to Republican party as much any more,” Greene said. “I don't know which one it is.”

Greene, who boasts 7.5 million followers on X and commands one of the largest social media audiences of any Republican woman, accused party leaders of betraying core conservative principles.

She did not criticize Trump himself, instead preferring to express her ire for what she attempted to paint as political elites.

“I think the Republican party has turned its back on America First and the workers and just regular Americans,” she said, warning that GOP leadership was reverting to its “neocon” past under the influence of what she termed the “good ole boys” network.

The 51-year-old lawmaker, in the roughly six-month mark following Trump's return to the White House, said she was particularly frustrated with the House speaker, Mike Johnson, saying: “I'm not afraid of Mike Johnson at all.”

Her remarks reflect a broader pattern of voter dissatisfaction with traditional party structures. Americans appear to also be holding deeply unfavorable views of both major parties: a July Wall Street Journal poll found 63% view the Democratic party unfavorably, its worst rating in 35 years, while Republicans fare only marginally better in most surveys.

Independent or independent-leaning Americans now account for nearly half the electorate, according to July Gallup polling, and public support has increasingly shifted toward Democrats through those leaners in recent months.

On Monday, Greene used social media to criticize the lack of accountability over what she deems key issues to the base, sharing a table showing no arrests for the “Russian Collusion Hoax”, “Jan 6th”, and “2020 Election”.

“Like what happened all those issues? You know that I don't know what the hell happened with the Republican Party. I really don't,” she said in the interview. “But I'll tell you one thing, the course that it's on, I don't want to have anything to do with it, and I just don't care any more.”

Her recent bills have targeted unconventional Republican territory: preventing cloud-seeding, making English the official US language, and cutting capital gains taxes on homes. She is also the first Republican in Congress to label the crisis in Gaza a genocide, and has called for ending foreign aid and using the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to cut down fraud and waste in the government.

Greene acknowledged her isolation within the party, saying: “I'm going alone right now on the issues that I'm speaking about.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Greg Abbott says he will try to remove Democrats unless they return to allow vote to take place on redrawing the US House map to favour Republicans

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I am Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours.

We start with the news that Republican Texas governor Greg Abbott has said he will begin trying to remove Democratic lawmakers from office on Monday if they don't return after dozens of them left the state in a last-resort attempt to block redrawn US House maps that president Donald Trump wants before the 2026 midterm elections.
 The revolt by the state House Democrats, many of whom went to Illinois or New York on Sunday, and Abbott giving them less than 24 hours to come home ratcheted up a widening fight over congressional maps, Associated Press reported.

The planned vote on Monday could see five new Republican-leaning seats created in the House of Representatives. The move by the Democrats threatens to thwart Republican efforts by denying them a quorum, or the minimum number of members to validate the vote's proceedings.

In a statement, Texas Democrats accused their counterparts, the Texas Republicans, of a “cowardly” surrender to Trump's call for a redrawing of the congressional map to “continue pushing his disastrous policies”.

“Texas Democratic lawmakers are halting Trump's plan by denying his bootlickers a quorum,” the statement read.

The scheme to flee the state is reported to have been put together by the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, who met with the Texas Democratic caucus late last month and has directed staff to provide logistical support for their stay.

The Texas group has accused governor Abbott of withholding aid to victims of Guadalupe River flooding last month in a bid to force the redistricting vote through.

“We're leaving Texas to fight for Texans,” Gene Wu, the Texas House Democratic caucus chair, said in a statement. “We will not allow disaster relief to be held hostage to a Trump gerrymander.”

“We're not walking out on our responsibilities; we're walking out on a rigged system that refuses to listen to the people we represent,” Wu added. “As of today, this corrupt special session is over.”

US trade representative Jamieson Greer has defended the firing of labor statistics chief Erika McEntarfer. “The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch,” he said on Face the Nation. Greer was among a host of Trump administration officials who were deployed to defend Trump after a week of bruising economic numbers.

The US Senate left Washington DC on Saturday night for its month-long August recess without a deal to advance dozens of Donald Trump's nominees, calling it quits after days of contentious bipartisan negotiations and the president taking to social media to tell Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to “GO TO HELL!”

In a new court filing, attorneys for the Trump administration denied the existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests, despite reports and prior statements from White House officials about pursuing a goal of at least 3,000 deportations or deportation arrests per day. Lawyers representing the US justice department said that the Department of Homeland Security had confirmed that “neither Ice leadership nor its field offices have been directed to meet any numerical quota or target for arrests, detentions, removals, field encounters, or any other operational activities that Ice or its components undertake in the course of enforcing federal immigration law.”

The US Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro – a former Fox News host and staunch Donald Trump ally who boosted lies that he lost the 2020 presidential race because of electoral fraudsters – as the top federal prosecutor for the nation's capital. Pirro – a former New York state district attorney and county judge who joined Fox News in 2011 – was confirmed on Saturday in a 50-45 vote along party lines.

The Smithsonian says it will restore Trump impeachment exhibits in “coming weeks”.

The Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, has vowed to protect the Democratic members of the Texas house of representatives who left the state in an attempt to block Republican efforts to redraw Texas's congressional maps.

“We're going to do everything we can to protect every single one of them and make sure that – 'cause we know they're doing the right thing, we know that they're following the law,” Pritzker said at a press conference on Sunday in Illinois alongside some of the the Texas Democratic lawmakers.

The Texas Democrats fled the state on Sunday in an effort to prevent the Texas house from reaching the quorum on Monday needed to vote on a newly proposed congressional map.

In response to the Democrats' actions, Greg Abbott, the Republican Texas governor, threatened to expel the Texas Democrats from the state house if they do not return by Monday at 3pm CT – when the legislature is set to resume. Ken Paxton, Texas's Republican attorney general, also condemned their actions on Sunday and threatened their arrest.

“Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately,” he said in a statement. “We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law.”

But Pritzker, who said he will support the Texas Democrats, described their actions as “a righteous act of courage”, saying that they “were left no choice but to leave their home state, block a vote from taking place, and protect their constituents”.

Some 600 former Israeli security officials, including previous heads of the Mossad and the military, have urged Donald Trump to pressure Israel to end its war in Gaza as the country's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, considers expanding his assault.

In an open letter, the former officials said an end to the war was the only way to save hostages still held by Hamas.

“Your credibility with the vast majority of Israelis augments your ability to steer prime minister Netanyahu and his government in the right direction: end the war, return the hostages, stop the suffering,” they wrote.

They added that they thought Hamas no longer posed a strategic threat to Israel.

An expansion of the war would be contrary to what Trump's Middle East envoy told the families of hostages over the weekend was the US position. Steve Witkoff said Washington was backing a comprehensive end to the Gaza war that would bring hostages home and assured the families that would not mean more fighting.

Any expansion of the conflict would risk worsening the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza. A UN-affiliated humanitarian body said the territory was experiencing famine, as the approximate 2.1 million people who live there experience mass starvation.

“I think the Republican party has turned its back on America First and the workers and just regular Americans,” she said, warning that GOP leadership was reverting to its “neocon” past under the influence of what she termed the “good ole boys” network.

In the roughly six-month mark following Trump's return to the White House, Greene said she was particularly frustrated with the House speaker, Mike Johnson, saying: “I'm not afraid of Mike Johnson at all.”

On Monday, Greene, 51, used social media to criticize the lack of accountability over what she deems key issues to the base, sharing a table showing no arrests for the “Russian Collusion Hoax”, “Jan 6th”, and “2020 Election”.

“Like what happened all those issues? You know that I don't know what the hell happened with the Republican Party. I really don't,” she said in the interview. “But I'll tell you one thing, the course that it's on, I don't want to have anything to do with it, and I just don't care any more.”

Her recent bills have targeted unconventional Republican territory: preventing cloud-seeding, making English the official US language, and cutting capital gains taxes on homes. She is also the first Republican in Congress to label the crisis in Gaza a genocide, and has called for ending foreign aid and using the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to cut down fraud and waste in the government.

Greene acknowledged her isolation within the party, saying: “I'm going alone right now on the issues that I'm speaking about.”

A Doge-style audit launched by Florida's Republican governor Ron DeSantis into Democratic-run cities and counties he accuses of wasteful spending could soon be known by an offensive new name: FAFO, universally known as a meme for the phrase “fuck around and find out”.

In a post to X on Monday, DeSantis said the acronym - which he claims actually stands for a Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight he has yet to formally commission, had “a nice ring to it” and that he “might need to work up an executive order and make it official”.

Under the guise of ensuring “transparency and accountability” in local government, DeSantis sent audit teams last week into the city of Gainesville, and Broward county, two pockets of Democratic strength in a largely Republican state.

It is part of a wider initiative the governor trumpeted earlier this year to replicate Elon Musk's Doge (the so-called “department of government efficiency”) efforts at state level in support of his ambitious longer-term goal of eliminating property taxes.

Taking credit for the FAFO handle is Florida's new chief financial officer Blaise Ingoglia, a staunch DeSantis ally whose X profile includes the words “If you're looking for snark, you've found it.”

He posted on Monday an assertion that he got “a rave reception” when he rolled out the new nickname at a party event over the weekend.

The president has said that India will be subject to a tariff hike for not only “buying massive amounts of Russian oil” but “selling it on the open market for big profits”. He announced his decision on Truth Social, saying that India does not care “how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine”. It's unclear what the levy increase will be.

Trump already hit India with a 25% tariff last week, citing the country's substantial purchasing of Russian oil as part of the penalty.

South Carolina congresswoman Nancy Mace has officially entered governor's race for the Palmetto state.

In a video announcement posted on social media, Mace, 47, positions herself as a conservative “firebrand” and a “fighter”. She also cites her credentials as the first woman to graduate from South Carolina's “The Citadel”– one of the country's oldest military colleges.

In her first two terms in office, Mace was a vocal Trump adversary. In 2021, she was one of seven House Republicans who signed a letter that said Congress did not have the authority to overturn the 2020 election results. She also heavily criticised the president's role in the Capitol attacks on 6 January 2021. Notably, Mace did not vote to impeach him for inciting an insurrection.

Throughout her third term in Congress, Mace has now become a key Trump ally. She's waged some of the president's key battles in the culture war – including a resolution prohibiting trans women using bathrooms that align with their gender identity at the US Capitol. Mace confirmed this was to target incoming freshman Representative Sarah McBride of Delaware.

Mace is entering an already crowded primary for gubernatorial race in South Carolina. While the incumbent, Henry McMaster, is unable to seek a third term, Mace will be facing off against Alan Wilson, the state's attorney general.

In a lengthy floor speech earlier this year, Mace called out Wilson for failing to prosecute four men, including her ex-fiancé, who she accuses of rape and sex-trafficking.

Governor Hochul confirms that she hasn't and won't spend any money housing the Texas lawmakers in New York City.

She added that the Democrats who did flee will probably face exorbitant legal fees, as well as highlighting the daily fine of $500 for not appearing during the legislative session without permission.

The delegation of Texas lawmakers present today did not confirm where they would be travelling to next, but did say they “won't be going back to Texas”.

Representative Mihaela Plesa, vice-chair of the House Democratic caucus, says that the redistricting battle in Texas goes beyonds the state's borders:

If Trump and Abbott succeed, it will give them five seats. But then where else do they go? Ohio, Missouri, any other Republican legislature with Democratic Congress people. They're on the chopping block too.

Governor Hochul calls the Texas Democrats who left the state to trigger a quorum break “profiles in courage”.

She adds that they're “on the right side of history” and this redistricting fight is a “war”.

Texas Democrats who fled the state are now holding a press conference with New York Governor Kathy Hochul.

Hochul kicks off her remarks:

Americans don't want a system that's stacked against them. They believe in fairness, it's fundamental. I'll tell you this. They're done with the chaos, they're done with the cruelty. And I would say they're ready to vote Republicans out of power in Washington, certainly in the upcoming 2026 elections.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has made an unannounced visit to Israel, per the minister of defense's post on X.

Johnson was joined by a delegation of House Republicans. Axios reports that this was a trip organised by a pro-Israel advocacy group, and that Johnson made a stop at a settlement on the occupied West Bank.

This comes after Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration's Middle East envoy, travelled to Gaza on Friday to assess the food and aid situation after several reports of worsening starvation in the region.

On Sunday, the president addressed reporters' questions about Witkoff's visit. “We're putting up money to get people fed,” he said. “We don't want people to starve.”

Just a short while ago, the president took to Truth Social to repeat his claim that last week's jobs report was “rigged” and the overall conduct of the Bureau of Labor Statistics is “in favor of the Radical Left Democrats”.

He added that “the FAKE political numbers that were CONCOCTED in order to make a great Republican Success look less stellar!!!”

The administration has provided no evidence that McEntarfer's conduct was in any way political, or that the recent jobs numbers were manipulated.

In an interview with CNN's Audie Cornish, the Texas Democratic party chair Kendall Scudder urged Democrats to “stop trying to be the only adults in the room”.

He added that the GOP's new congressional map should be a “signal flare” for blue states to “start carving up their own seats”.

Scudder said that this weekend's action by Texas Democrats is part of an effort to hold state Republicans “accountable for their actions”:

The reality is, no Democrat is sitting around itching and waiting for a quorum break. But this is what has to be done to make sure we're preserving democracy.

In response to Governor Greg Abbott threatening to arrest and expel any Texas legislators who refuse to return to the state capitol by 3pm local time on Monday, the Texas House Democratic Caucus issued a short and simple statement: “Come and take it.”

Governor Abbott however, has also said that Texas Democrats “may have committed felonies” by asking for donations to help pay for fines that they incur by fleeing the state. House rules in Texas state that lawmakers rack up a $500-a-day fine for each day they are absent without permission during a legislative session.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Karin Keller-Sutter accused of mishandling talks as shares dive after Switzerland hit with 39% tariff

Europe live – latest updates

US live – latest updates

The Swiss stock market has plunged, the cabinet has held crisis talks and the country's president, Karin Keller-Sutter, has been accused of mishandling a vital phone call with the White House after Donald Trump hit the country with a shock 39% export tariff.

Switzerland, home to some of the world's best-known luxury brands, was left stunned after the US president on Friday imposed one of the highest tariff rates in his global trade reset. Industry associations said tens of thousands of jobs were at risk.

Local media had reported that after three months of talks, negotiators believed they had secured a 10% tariff on exports to the US, a key market for Swiss products such as luxury watches, jewellery and chocolate but also machinery and pharmaceuticals.

But after a 30-minute call with Keller-Sutter on Thursday evening variously described as “bad-tempered”, “disastrous” and “badly misjudged”, Trump imposed a levy even higher than the 31% he had announced on his so-called “liberation day” in April.

Switzerland's blue-chip stock market index opened 1.8% lower on Monday, the first day of trading since the tariff announcement on Swiss National Day, a public holiday. The cabinet said after an emergency meeting it would improve its offer to Trump.

“Switzerland enters this new phase ready to present a more attractive offer, taking US concerns into account and seeking to ease the current tariff situation,” it said in a statement, without detailing what concrete proposals it might make.

Swiss officials rejected reports that the 39% rate was imposed because of the call between Trump and Keller-Sutter, the finance minister and current president under the country's rotating system. “The call was not a success,” a government source said.

“There was not a good outcome for Switzerland. But there was not a quarrel. Trump made it clear from the very beginning that he had a completely different point of view, that 10% tariffs were not enough,” the source told Reuters.

Swiss media were less forgiving. “Faced with Trump, Keller-Sutter was surely too naive,” was the headline in the tabloid Blick, while 24 Heures said what should have been her “masterpiece” ended up as “the heaviest defeat of her political career”.

The rate would have a huge impact on Switzerland's export-oriented economy and could spark a recession, said Hans Gersbach, an economist at ETH Zürich university, especially if pharmaceuticals, which are not covered, were included.

Swiss companies, whose exports to the US account for about one-sixth of their total foreign sales, face one of the steepest US duties – only Laos, Myanmar and Syria had higher figures, at 40-41%. The EU and the UK negotiated 15% and 10% respectively.

The business minister, Guy Parmelin, told RTS public radio on Monday that the government needed to “fully understand what happened, why the US president made this decision. Once we have that on the table, we can decide how to proceed.”

Parmelin said Berne would move fast, revise its offer and “hope to achieve something” by 7 August, when the tariffs were due to come into effect. He and Keller-Sutter were ready to travel to Washington for further talks if necessary, he added.

The business minister said Trump was focused on the US trade deficit with Switzerland, which was Sfr38.5bn (£35.8bn) last year. The country could offer to buy more US liquefied natural gas, as the EU had done, or Swiss companies could invest more in the US, he said.

Keller-Sutter said on Friday that Berne would keep talking to Washington but there were only limited concessions it could offer, as US imports already enjoyed 99.3% free market access and multiple Swiss companies had invested heavily in the US.

Analysts have said tariffs could still change at any moment because of the unpredictability of the Trump administration, with several suggesting their base case remained that Switzerland would eventually end up with a rate similar to that of the EU's.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Born in London in 1912, Turing showed exceptional talent in mathematics and science from a young age. At 16, he understood Albert Einstein's work without difficulty. This intelligence carried him through studies at Cambridge University and later at Princeton University in the US, where he further explored complex mathematical theories.
In 1936, Turing introduced the concept of the Turing machine, a theoretical device for solving mathematical problems. He described it as having an infinite tape on which symbols could be read, interpreted, and modified. With simple

As 95% of its residents now use the Digital Post service, Denmark has seen a 90% decline in letter volumes since 2000, from 1.4 billion to 110 million last year.
  On top of that, the Postal Act of 2024 removes the government's obligation to provide universal mail service and puts an end to postal exemptions from value-added tax, raising the cost of a single letter to 29 Danish krone (US$4.20).

The Russian and Chinese navies are conducting joint artillery and anti-submarine drills in the Sea of Japan as part of scheduled military exercises, Russian officials said Aug. 3.

The maneuvers, part of the ""Maritime Interaction-2025"" exercise, began two days after U.S. President Donald Trump said he had ordered two nuclear submarines to be deployed to ""appropriate regions"" in response to what he called ""foolish and inflammatory"" nuclear threats from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.

Russian authorities said the drills were planned well before Trump's remarks.

Russian state media reported that the exercises involve a joint detachment of Russian and Chinese warships, including a large Russian anti-submarine vessel and two Chinese destroyers. Diesel-electric submarines from both countries are participating, along with a Chinese submarine rescue ship.

The drills, which are scheduled to conclude Aug. 5, include artillery fire exercises, anti-submarine warfare training, air defense operations, and joint search and rescue missions.

Russia and China signed a ""no limits"" strategic partnership shortly before Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Since then, the two countries have deepened their military and economic ties.

While Beijing has claimed neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine war, it has become one of Moscow's most critical lifelines — supplying defense equipment and purchasing large quantities of Russian oil.

Trump said Aug. 1 his submarine order was in response to what he described as ""highly provocative"" statements from Medvedev about the possibility of war between the nuclear-armed rivals.

The United States and Russia hold the world's largest nuclear arsenals and rarely disclose movements or deployments of their submarines.

Trump's remarks come amid heightened tensions with Moscow and frustration over a lack of progress in ending the war in Ukraine.

Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian S-300 surface-to-air missile system in the Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine's General Staff said on Aug. 4.

The S-300 is a long-range surface-to-air missile system that intercepts aircraft, cruise and ballistic missiles. Developed by the Soviet Union, it remains a key component of Russia's air defense and, depending on the variant, can engage multiple targets at ranges of up to 150 kilometers (93 miles).

Russian forces also use the system to attack Ukrainian-controlled territory and target frontline military positions of the Ukrainian army.

The destruction of this target deals a significant blow to the Russian long-range fire capabilities, limiting its ability to strike Ukrainian positions and civilian infrastructure in the region, according to Ukraine's General Staff.

""Ukrainian forces continue to systematically destroy key elements of Russia's military capabilities, weakening the enemy's ability to carry out combat operations, hold illegally occupied territories, and sustain the occupation,"" the General Staff said.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report.

Russia has occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast since the onset of its full-scale invasion in 2022, subjecting the rest of its territories to daily aerial and artillery attacks.

Iga Swiatek of Poland plays a forehand against Clara Tauson of Denmark during their fourth round singles women's match at the National Bank Open at IGA Stadium on Sunday in Montreal.Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images

Iga Swiatek's National Bank Open has come to an end in the fourth round.

The world's third-ranked player and reigning Wimbledon champion fell in straight sets 7-6 (1), 6-3 to Denmark's Clara Tauson on a cool and windy Sunday night at Montreal's IGA Stadium.

Swiatek, who had lost just eight combined games through her opening two matches of the tournament, was eliminated one night after top seed Coco Gauff's premature exit to Canadian Victoria Mboko, also in the fourth round.

After her upset win over Gauff, Mboko is the headliner in Montreal NBO

It was Tauson's first win in four career meetings with Swiatek. The Poland tennis star most notably beat her in the fourth round at Wimbledon last month on her way to the championship.

Tauson, the world No. 19 and 16th seed in Montreal, has yet to drop a set in the tournament. She converted on three of her five break point opportunities, while saving seven of the nine break points she faced.

She advances to the quarterfinals of a WTA 1000 tournament for just the second time in her career. The Dane made it to the finals of this year's Dubai Tennis Championships, losing to Mirra Andreeva in straight sets.

Swiatek was broken early in the first set, but managed to get the break back to force a first-set tiebreak. Tauson took advantage of a powering serve and repeated unforced errors from Swiatek to dominate the tiebreak 7-1.

A visibly frustrated Swiatek stopped to speak with her coach on her way off to the locker room following that first set.

Her frustration was not quelled upon her return for the second set. Swiatek was broken in the fourth game of the set to fall behind 3-1.

The six-time Grand Slam champion would break back in the seventh game, but immediately coughed the break up the following game on a double fault.

Tauson held serve at 5-3 to secure the win and her spot in the quarterfinals.

Tauson will next play American Madison Keys on Tuesday. The sixth-seed rebounded from a one-set deficit to beat Czechia's Karolina Muchova 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 earlier Sunday.

“Clara's a fantastic ball striker,” said Keys. “She's got a big serve. She's got a lot of power on both sides.

“She covers the court quite well on top of everything, so I feel like she's one of those matches where you kind of have to temper a little bit and not go for things too quickly.”

Keys, a runner-up at the 2016 tournament in Montreal, matched Ana Ivanovic for the longest gap between quarterfinal appearances at the event in the Open Era. Keys had not made it past the second round in Canada since losing to Simona Halep in that final nine years ago.

The win also gave Keys her 75th career win against a player ranked inside the top 20 of the WTA rankings.

After squandering a breakpoint opportunity of her own in just the second game of the match, Keys was broken at love the following game to fall behind 2-1.

While breaks of serve were exchanged in the sixth and seventh games, that early break proved to be just enough for Muchova to take the opening set 6-4.

Keys bounced back in the second set. The 2025 Australian Open champion took advantage of an untimely double fault by Muchova, her first of the match, to break the Czech's service and pull ahead 3-1. Keys ultimately forced a decider, sealing the second set with a 172 km/h ace.

Despite opening the third and final set with a break of serve, there was plenty of adversity for Keys. After being broken back in the fourth game, Keys was forced to fend off a pair of match points in the 10th game.

This galvanized Keys, who broke the following game on her way to the win.

Japan's Naomi Osaka cruised to a 6-1, 6-0 victory in just 49 minutes over Latvia's Anastasija Sevastova to also advance to the quarterfinals.

“I'm definitely really happy,” said Osaka. “Today was obviously faster than I thought it would be, but I'm really happy with how the game plan went. I'm excited to play my next match.”

Osaka hit five aces, committed no double faults and was a perfect five-for-five on her break point opportunities. She is the first Japanese player in the Open Era to reach multiple quarterfinals at the tournament, also in 2019.

The former world No. 1 and four-time Grand Slam champion has been steadily working her way backup the rankings after missing the entire 2023 season while on maternity leave. Osaka, currently ranked 49th in the world, is expected to jump at least 15 more spots with the win.

“I talked to my dad and he said just being healthy and happy is a form of success,” said Osaka. “I agree with that, but I want more.

“Of course, I would want to win Slams, I would want to be in top 10, but I think I need to pace myself and go for the mini goals. Eventually, they'll turn into the big goals.”

Osaka will face the winner of Sunday night's matchup between 2025 Wimbledon finalist and fifth seed Amanda Anisimova and Ukraine's Elina Svitolina, the tournament's 10th seed.

The National Bank Open continues until Thursday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","The iX3 isn't just a new car, but the tip of a transformation shift for BMW","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/mobility/article-the-ix3-isnt-just-a-new-car-but-the-tip-of-a-transformation-shift-for/","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The new iX3 isn't just a new car, it's the start of a transformational shift in design, technology and sustainability within the 109-year-old German luxury carmaker. 

The iX3, which won't be officially revealed until early September, is the first production model based on the Neue Klasse platform, a name used for a generation of vehicles six decades ago. The original Neue Klasse vehicles built between 1962 and 1972 saved the automaker from bankruptcy and gave rise to some of its most popular models including the 3, 5 and 7 Series sedans. Neue Klasse today symbolizes a generational leap in technology and everything the company is doing to be more sustainable throughout a vehicle's entire lifecycle.

By 2027, 40 models globally will feature Neue Klasse technology, according to the company. It's an all-encompassing approach that scrutinizes everything from increased use of recycled materials, next-level production processes and supply-chain management, to a new generation of more environmentally friendly factories. 

The newly build Plant Debrecen in Hungary, where the 2027 BMW iX3 will begin production later this year, is BMW's cleanest plant to date. It emits two-thirds less carbon dioxide than the average BMW plant. It takes advantage of solar energy and thermal storage facilities, and features the world's first fully electric paint shop. 

Specially designed for the production of electric vehicles, it's the first BMW plant to operate without the use of fossil fuels.

These measures will eventually get retrofitted to existing BMW plants, helping reduce carbon emissions by 90 per cent by 2050, the company says. Measures taken since 2019 put BMW on track to reduce its global emissions to 109 megatons from 150 by 2030. 

The iX3 is a battery-electric compact luxury crossover using BMW's next-generation 800-volt electric platform. The new Gen 6 powertrain and battery blow the prior generation units out of the water with up to 800 kilometres of range (on the optimistic WLTP scale) and charging speeds up to 400 kilowatts. According to the company, a customer can add more than 350 kilometres of range in 10 minutes. 

The iX3 will have four “superbrains,” including the new “heart of joy” supercomputer responsible for all things related to drivetrain management. It's a massive decrease in the amount of computer modules typically found in a modern car and represents a giant leap in software and computing power. It will also simplify production and greatly reduce the amount of wiring required.

One third of every new iX3 will be made from recycled materials. 

Recycled plastic bottles are used to make the seat covers and yarn, as well as the headliner, floor mats and floor coverings.

The plastic storage compartment under the hood consists of 30 per cent recycled fishing nets and suspension components such as the swivel bearings and wheel carriers are made using up to 80 per cent recycled aluminum. Even the rims contain up to 70 per cent recycled raw material.

When it comes to the end of the iX3's life, many components such as the aluminum in the wheels and suspension parts can be reused and put back into the supply chain. This circular production philosophy is a cornerstone of BMW's mission to reduce its carbon footprint.

The biggest culprit for emissions in an EV is the battery. Mining and processing the raw material required to make them is energy-intensive and damaging to the environment, but BMW says its sixth-generation battery cells contain up to 20 per cent recycled material and produce 42 per cent less emissions per watt-hour than the previous generation.

BMW plotted the lifetime emissions of an iX3 and found it would take one year or 21,500 kilometres to break even with an equivalent gas-powered vehicle. After 200,000 kilometres, the iX3's carbon footprint would be 34 per cent smaller. This was based on a mix of European electricity sources, but it would be even better if the iX3 were charged exclusively using renewable energy. 

In 2021, the province of Ontario generated 91 per cent of its electricity from zero-carbon sources that included nuclear, hydroelectric and wind, meaning an iX3 here would reach the breakeven point with a gas car in less than a year.

We won't see the iX3 arrive here until 2026, and it will mark the first time BMW has sold it on this side of the Atlantic. Previous versions of the iX3, not to be confused with the oddball i3, have been on sale in other markets since 2020.

After ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas collapsed, PM Netanyahu is reportedly considering ""decisive"" military action in the enclave. Hostage families warn this could endanger their loved ones. DW has more.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is advocating for the release of hostages through a ""decisive military victory,"" Israeli media reported.

It is a strategy that could see Israeli forces operating in areas believed to be controlled by Hamas, where hostages are suspected to be held. 

In response, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the vast majority of hostage families, condemned the approach, stating that Netanyahu is ""leading Israel and the hostages toward devastation.""

This blog tracks developments in the Middle East on Monday, August 4:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene a cabinet meeting later this week on how to proceed with  the war in Gaza.

Netanyahu said the cabinet will meet to ""instruct the (army) on how to achieve the three war objectives we have set,"" with the three objectives being the defeat of Hamas, the release of the hostages held in the enclave and ""the promise that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel.""

Yesterday, hostage family members criticized Netanyahu for his intention to further expand the war in Gaza, potentially putting hostages at risk, saying the Israeli leader would lead Israel and the hostages ""into destruction.""

If Hamas grants access, Red Cross doctors could enter the area where Israeli hostages are held to provide medical care.

The development follows the release of harrowing videos showing emaciated captives.

However, Hamas says medical access depends on the opening of humanitarian corridors across the entire Gaza Strip.

DW speaks with Sarah Davies from the ICRC about the proposed operation.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar on Monday said the hostages held in Gaza should be top of the global agenda.

Saar was speaking to the press ahead of a trip to New York to take part in a special UN Security Council session about the hostages' situation.

""The world must put an end to the phenomenon of kidnapping civilians,"" he said.

""It must be front and center on the world stage,"" he added. 

Fifty Israeli hostages are still held by Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza, with some 20 of them believed to be still alive.

The special security council meeting was called after Hamas and Islamic Jihad published videos last week showing two hostages appearing weak and emaciated, causing shock and distress in Israel.

Germany's Interior Ministry said it is reviewing the feasibility of bringing children from Gaza to Germany for treatment.

According to a ministry spokesperson, the project depends ""crucially"" on the security situation, the possibility of leaving the country, and other factors.

No formal inquiries have been received from German cities, the spokesperson said. However, the cities of Hanover and Düsseldorf have already said they would accept children from the Gaza Strip and Israel who need treatment.

Responding to the idea of flying patients from Gaza to Germany, a spokesperson for the German Chancellery reacted cautiously.

""We'd only be talking about a handful of people, and there would be numerous other questions to clarify,"" the spokesperson told German broadcaster RTL/ntv.

Lebanon is marking five years since the explosion at Beirut's port that killed more than 220 people and injured over 6,500.

No one has been held accountable for the 2020 blast, and demonstrations are expected across the country demanding justice and the identification of those responsible.

In a statement, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun promised that ""justice is coming.""

According to Aoun, Lebanon is ""committed to uncovering the whole truth, no matter the obstacles or how high the positions"" involved.

""The law applies to all, without exception,"" Aoun said.

The anniversary has been declared a national day of mourning.

Hundreds of retired Israeli security officials have called on US President Donald Trump to pressure the Israeli government to end the war in Gaza.

An open letter signed by 550 individuals, including former heads of intelligence agencies, urged Trump to ""steer"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toward a ceasefire.

""It is our professional judgment that Hamas no longer poses a strategic threat to Israel,"" the letter reads, with former internal security service head Ami Ayalon stating that the country has ""achieved all military objectives.""

According to the signatories, a ceasefire in Gaza could pave the way for a regional coalition to support a reformed Palestinian Authority in taking control of the Gaza Strip.

After failed negotiations between Israel and Hamas over a ceasefire and hostage release deal, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is determined to ""release the hostages through decisive military victory,"" Israeli media reported, citing a diplomatic source.

The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents most of the hostages' families, responded to the reports by saying Netanyahu is ""leading Israel and the hostages to devastation,"" calling attempts to free hostages through military action a ""fraud"" and an ""illusion.""

This follows the release of two videos by Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, showing Israeli hostages who appear pale and emaciated. In one video, a hostage is seen digging what appears to be his own grave, barely able to hold a shovel.

A year ago, six Israeli hostages were killed after their Hamas captors believed the Israeli army was closing in on their hideout.

Hamas has said it is willing to grant the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) access to the Israeli hostages it has held for 667 days, on the condition that ""humanitarian corridors"" are opened across all areas of the Gaza Strip.""

The statement follows the release of two videos by Hamas and Islamic Jihad, showing Israeli hostages appearing gaunt and in visibly poor condition.

The groups said they were ready to cooperate and deliver food to those they are holding if Israel agrees to open humanitarian corridors across the entire Gaza Strip. 

In response, the ICRC said it was ""appalled"" by the footage and reiterated its call for immediate access to the hostages.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had asked the organization to help deliver medical aid to the hostages, describing the videos as a source of ""profound shock.""

We're tracking the latest developments in Israel's war in Gaza, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly considering expanding the Israeli military's operations into areas where Israeli hostages are believed to be held.

This follows the release of two videos showing Israeli hostages in visibly deteriorating health, one of them pale and gaunt, the other reportedly forced to dig his own grave.

The footage was published by Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

The move comes as Lee Jae-myung's new government in South Korea seeks to normalize its relations with Pyongyang.

South Korea began dismantling loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North Korea messages along the border on Monday, according to the country's Defense Ministry.

The move is part of President Lee Jae-myung's efforts to improve relations with Pyongyang.

""Starting today, the military has begun removing the loudspeakers,"" Lee Kyung-ho, spokesperson for the South's Defense Ministry, told reporters.

""It is a practical measure aimed at helping ease tensions with the North, provided that such actions do not compromise the military's state of readiness.""

He added that all loudspeakers are expected to be removed by the end of the week.

Shortly after taking office in June, following the impeachment of his predecessor, Lee's administration halted the broadcasts to ""restore trust.""

A day later, Pyongyang also stopped its broadcasts, which had long been a source of irritation for South Korean residents near the border.

Although the two countries remain technically at war, Lee seeks to reduce tensions and revive long-stalled dialogue with the North.

However, North Korea recently rejected the overture, stating it had no interest in talks with Seoul.

""If the ROK... expected that it could reverse all the results it had made with a few sentimental words, nothing is more serious miscalculation than it,"" North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's powerful sister Kim Yo Jong said last week, using South Korea's official name.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Political ploy? Czech Republic outlaws communist propaganda","https://www.dw.com/en/political-ploy-czech-republic-outlaws-communist-propaganda/a-73490445","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 02:08:14 GMT","

The Czech criminal code now bans the promotion of communist ideology, making it equivalent to Nazi propaganda. At the same time, the Czech communist party is one of the most successful in Europe. What's going on?

For staunch opponents of communism in the Czech Republic, it's the happy end to a very long story. After the country's so-called Velvet Revolution, which started in 1989 and led to end of the communist regime there, opponents of the ideology demanded that communists be treated the same as German Nazis had been. More than 30 years later, their demands have finally been met. 

In late July, Czech President Petr Pavel signed an amendment to his country's criminal code that criminalizes the promotion of communist ideology, placing it on the same footing as Nazi propaganda. The amendment will enter into force on January 1, 2026.

The movement to amend the law was first initiated by Martin Mejstrik, formerly a leader of the student protests during the Velvet Revolution and later a Czech senator. Historians from the Czech Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes, or the USTR, also joined the initiative and this spring, the amendment passed through the Czech political system, supported by Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala's pro-European coalition government. President Pavel's signature in July finalized the process.

The amendment of section 403 of the Czech criminal code now allots a jail sentence of one to five years for anyone who ""establishes, supports or promotes Nazi, communist, or other movements which demonstrably aim to suppress human rights and freedoms or incite racial, ethnic, national, religious or class-based hatred.""

""The aim of this draft was to eliminate an obviously unfair distinction between two criminal totalitarian ideologies of the 20th century,"" Kamil Nedvedicky, a deputy director at the USTR, had explained before the amendment was passed.

Both of those ideologies suppressed fundamental rights and freedoms, he said. ""It is logical and just that Czech criminal law clearly reflects this. It's not about ideology, it's about protecting the democratic constitutional state,"" he said.

Somewhat ironically, the Czech Republic is also one of the few countries in the European Union that has a comparatively successful communist party. The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, or KSCM, was formed in 1990 and until the last Czech parliamentary election four years ago, had members of parliament and even provided several Czech vice presidents.

The KSCM was the offspring of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, a dictatorial regime with a Marxist-Leninist ideology that ruled the country until 1989. The KSCM has tens of thousands of members and entered the European Parliament after the 2024 EU elections as part of the left-wing Stacilo! (in English, ""Enough!"") coalition. Polling indicates the Stacilo! electoral alliance will likely get over the 5% hurdle in the Czech Republic's October parliamentary elections too. Its lead candidate is KSCM leader and member of the European Parliament, Katerina Konecna.

And that may not be all. The current favorite in domestic elections is Andrej Babis, a former Czech prime minister, oligarch and the leader of the right-wing populist party, ANO (in English, ""YES""). Babis has not ruled out working with Stacilo! to form a new coalition.

The new amendment to Czech law could potentially even lead to a ban on the KSCM. That happened to the Workers' Party, a Czech far-right, extremist and neo-Nazi party, in 2010.

KSCM leader Konecna told DW that the amendment is a political attack on her party by the current government.

""It's about the systematic attempt by the antisocial, corrupt government of Petr Fiala to silence its loudest critics,"" she argued. ""That definitely has no place in a democratic society.""

Konecna also said it was ""amusing"" that the amendment was signed into law by Pavel, who was previously a prominent member of the original Czech Communist Party.

Pavel, a former career soldier, was a member of the Communist Party until 1989. ""In retrospect and with the knowledge I have today, it was a decision I am definitely not proud of,"" the Czech president has previously said. 

""I think the last 30 years that I have dedicated to building a safer Czech Republic are a symbolic apology to society,"" he also previously said in an interview with Czech tabloid, Blesk. Pavel served as chief of staff of the Czech military between 2012 and 2015 and as chairman of the NATO military committee for more than three years, from 2015.

KSCM leader Konecna argues that the Czech government should be addressing issues ordinary citizens have to deal with, like high energy prices and unaffordable housing. Instead, she claims, they've spent their time passing a law to silence political critics.

""But we won't be intimidated,"" she said combatively. ""Even if they threaten us a hundred times and imprison us.""

Russian politicians have also spoken out about the new Czech rules. ""When the state and system of that time are compared to fascist ideology and the fascist regime, it is quite obvious that this is being done to question, accuse, and condemn our country,"" Vyacheslav Volodin, the chairman of the Russian Federation's parliament, the Duma, said on July 25, according to Russia's state news agency Tass.

Ghislaine's Maxwell's arrival at a minimum-security prison in Texas has provoked anger among her fellow inmates.

A prisoner at Federal Prison Camp (FPC) Bryan told The Telegraph she was “disgusted” by Maxwell's transfer and that her feelings were widely shared by other inmates at the facility.

Maxwell, the British socialite and former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein, was quietly moved to the prison camp 100 miles outside Houston, Texas, this week from a stricter low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida.

Her new prison mostly houses inmates convicted of “white-collar” crimes and low-level offences, and they are said to be angry that Maxwell is being held among them.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for procuring underage girls for the late financier and convicted paedophile, who took his own life in prison in 2019.

Julie Howell, 44, who is serving a one-year sentence for theft, told The Telegraph that “every inmate I've heard from is upset she's here”.

“This facility is supposed to house non-violent offenders,” she added. “Human trafficking is a violent crime.”

Inmates at minimum-security institutions, also known as FPCs, benefit from low prison guard-to-inmate ratio and limited-to-no perimeter fencing.

It is the same prison facility where Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, a fraudulent blood-testing company, is serving an 11-year sentence.

It also allows inmates to play with puppies as part of a scheme to train dogs to become service animals.

Upon Maxwell's arrival at the facility, prisoners were allegedly locked down and had the blinds shut in an apparent effort to shield her from view.

The transfer comes a week after she was interviewed by Todd Blanche, Donald Trump's deputy attorney general, leading to intense speculation that some sort of deal has been cut.

Mr Trump has come under pressure in recent weeks to release all information related to Epstein, after the Department of Justice and FBI concluded that he died by suicide and did not possess a “client list”.

During a nine-hour interrogation with Mr Blanche, Maxwell was allegedly grilled about Epstein's connections to Bill Clinton, the Duke of York and Bill Gates, as well several other billionaires, according to the Daily Mail.

Maxwell's legal team have said she is willing to testify before Congress in exchange for a presidential pardon or having her sentence commuted – a possibility Mr Trump has not ruled out.

Inmates at FPC Bryan are worried about their own safety, given the widespread threats against Maxwell and lack of tight security on the prison grounds.

Howell said: “We have heard there are threats against her life and many of us are worried about our own safety because she's here.”

Her comments will only fuel concern that could be targeted at the facility, preventing her testimony about Epstein from ever seeing the light of day.

Maxwell was allegedly moved under the cover of darkness because she had been “bombarded” with death threats from r apists who accused her of being a “snitch”, according to the Mail on Sunday.

A source told the newspaper: “As soon as Ghislaine spoke to the government she was considered a snitch by other inmates at Tallahassee. There were very real and very credible threats on her life.

“There were real fears inside Tallahassee that they could not guarantee her safety, which is why she was moved.”

Howell, who self-surrendered in July to serve her sentence at FPC Bryan, has a daughter who was trafficked as a teenager.

In an email sent from prison about Maxwell's transfer, she wrote: “I am honestly shocked she was moved to a federal prison camp with her history and charges.”

The married mother-of-four said that her daughter was repeatedly trafficked from the age of 17, leading to her being “beaten, choked and eventually shot”.

Her daughter also allegedly became pregnant as a result and Howell said she has since adopted the child.

The former professor, who worked in children's education for 22 years, said she helped the FBI and local law enforcement agencies track down the perpetrators, who are now serving federal prison sentences of more than 20 years.

“That incident changed the trajectory of my daughter's life, as well as mine,” she said.

Howell said that the circumstances surrounding her daughter being shot provoked her mental health spiral and addiction to gambling, which she funded by resorting to theft.

In January, she pleaded guilty to stealing almost $1m from Tarleton State University, her former employer, between 2022 and 2024. She was sentenced to one year in prison in June.

Howell said: “I don't blame anyone else for the actions that brought me to FPC Bryan, but I can definitely say that the circumstances that surrounded my daughter being shot were what sparked my spiral and addiction to gambling to escape my reality.

“Having Ms Maxwell here triggered all of those feelings.”

Howell also warned that Maxwell could be a flight risk, given her previous efforts to avoid detection prior to her arrest.

She said: “This is a camp you can literally walk out of. I don't care how many people she turns in, it doesn't take away from her actions.

“As a mother of a sex-trafficking victim, I'm absolutely disgusted she's in this facility. Regardless of her reasoning, I don't think she belongs here.”

As Palestinians endure unbearable starvation, the sea was the last place where fresh food might be found.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

The Israeli military has imposed a full blockade on Gaza's sea from north to south, preventing fishers, swimmers, and all other Palestinians from entering the last remaining source of relief from this genocide.

The Israeli military's Arabic-language spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, announced the total maritime closure on July 12, 2025: “We remind you that strict security restrictions have been imposed in the maritime area adjacent to the Strip, and entry into the sea is prohibited.”  

This new restriction is designed to make the situation in Gaza even more unbearable amid unprecedented starvation and famine. “The IDF will respond to any violation of these restrictions,” Adraee threatened. “We urge fishermen, swimmers, and divers to refrain from entering the sea. Entering the sea along the Strip exposes you to danger,” the warning adds. Even approaching the shoreline is now forbidden by the Israeli military. Are they going to ban the air next? If they could, they absolutely would.

Israel had already attacked people trying to steal moments of normalcy. On June 30, 2025, Israel bombed the seaside Al-Baqa Café, killing more than 30 people who were attempting to get a moment of respite away from the war, until a rocket came and destroyed everything.

This latest restriction is a deliberate attack on Palestinian fishing infrastructure and the local food sources that provide Gaza's markets with fish. People are now effectively prohibited from fishing to feed themselves and their families amid this catastrophe.

Since March 2025, Israel has blocked lifesaving humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, aside from a few rare and meager shipments. According to the UN World Food Programme, Gaza's markets are facing a total depletion of food supplies. However, our fishers are taking risks in order to feed their fellow Palestinians through one last remaining local food source. 

The fishing industry was a main source of income for many people who were trying to secure a livelihood amid the deprivation of war. Even before the restrictions, not much was available — just a modest catch in accordance with Israel's imposed fishing limits — but it was a local source of sustenance that might have helped Palestinians survive as fresh food vanished from markets. 

Maher Al-Amoudi, a 37-year-old Palestinian fisherman, described his fishing experience before the latest restrictions were put in place. “I used to catch fish and sell them to people in Gaza's seaport,” Al-Amoudi said. 

“After the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza's seaport, I rushed immediately to check my fishing supplies,” he recalled. “I was shocked by the devastation. Boats were burned, fishing nets were totally destroyed, all my fishing equipment was unusable.” Now, Al-Amoudi is prohibited from practicing his right to fish — a right that once sustained both his family and his broader community. 

Gaza's fishers were used to facing risk and even death long before the war. But after October 7, with Israel imposing harsh restrictions on fishing zones, the Mediterranean Sea turned into a deadly trap, with Israeli soldiers potentially shooting at anyone who was trying to catch fish. “Even if we chose to take a risk, we were only allowed to go 100 meters, and even in that area, soldiers opened fire towards us,” said Al-Amoudi.

On July 19, five Palestinian fishers were detained by Israeli forces near Gaza City while fishing about 100 meters offshore. The Palestinian Information Center said that “Israeli vessels threw some of the fishermen into the sea after detaining them, while the others were taken to an unknown location,” based on reporting from Zakaria Bakr, coordinator of the Fishermen's Committees at the Union of Agricultural Work Committees. Bakr also reported that the Israeli forces opened fire toward the shoreline. 

By stealing the sea, Israel has taken Gaza's last food source. As Palestinians live through this unbearable starvation, the sea was the last place where fresh food might be found, but after the last full blockade in July, this hope of eating fresh food has shattered. 

Mohammed Al-Naffar, a 66-year-old Palestinian, is one of many who depended on fish as a source of nutrition. “I used to buy sardines every week to feed my body with protein,” Al-Naffar said. He is an elderly man, tired and hungry from ongoing starvation. “My body has lost all nourishment throughout this war,” he added. Fish is not a luxury for him — it is a last lifeline sustaining his fragile health. 

Al-Amoudi and thousands of other fishers are now without a livelihood. This ban, he said, is not just another restriction; it is about preventing Palestinians from securing the most basic human dignity. Many are now jobless and hopeless. “No money, so how could I offer the least to my children?” Al-Amoudi asked, his voice heavy with anger.

When the evacuation orders began in October 2023, Israeli soldiers ordered Palestinians to flee toward coastal areas. For displaced families, the sea is not a place for rest, it is a place for living. They go to the sea to leave behind tent heat, the suffocating war atmosphere, and their own anger. They turned to the sea as a place to escape, a place to breathe when it seems even breathing is prohibited. The sea was our last hope — and even hope has been stolen.

Eighty years after two U.S. atomic bombs killed between 110,000 to 210,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, public awareness of nuclear risks has fallen to new lows, said Laura Grego, senior scientist and research director with the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“I think people don't know how terrible nuclear war would be,” Grego told Truthout on July 16 — 80 years to the day since the first-ever atomic detonation in New Mexico. The Trinity test was conducted just three weeks before the U.S. dropped two atomic bombs on Japan.

Brian Schmidt, an American-Australian astrophysicist who received the Nobel Prize for physics in 2011, pointed out that many of today's nuclear weapons are far more destructive than the bombs used in the horrific Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. In contemporary arsenals, a single bomb can contain as much destructive power as was unleashed in all of World War II.

Currently, the world's nine nuclear-armed nations are estimated to possess the destructive equivalent of 146,500 Hiroshima-sized bombs, many of which are ready to launch on short notice.

Schmidt told Truthout that even a “small” nuclear weapon could precipitate the use of a gigaton's worth of nuclear arsenal being used, causing the collapse of civilization.

“I think the public needs to be focused on asking our respective governments to lower the risk of nuclear war,” he said.

Today, nuclear weapons spending is rising, nuclear-armed nations are modernizing and upgrading their weapons, and China is rapidly expanding its arsenal. Currently, the U.S. has seven modernization programs underway, is building two new nuclear weapons facilities, and replacing its entire intercontinental ballistic missile force with a new system that is 81 percent over budget. The U.S., which spends more on nuclear weapons than the other eight nations combined, is forecast to spend an average of $95 billion per year over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

In contemporary arsenals, a single bomb can contain as much destructive power as was unleashed in all of World War II.

In recent years, nuclear threats have become increasingly common while diplomacy and dialogue are overshadowed by mistrust, conflict, and war. As reliance on nuclear weapons grows, there are fears of a new arms race and possible return to nuclear explosive testing. This comes as critical arms treaties have been abandoned or face an uncertain future.

In 2001, George W. Bush announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and under Donald Trump, the U.S. has rejected or withdrawn from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the Open Skies Treaty, the (conventional) Arms Trade Treaty, and the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the U.S. and Russia, the New START Treaty, will end in February 2026 unless it is renegotiated or replaced soon.

After World War II, the U.S., followed by the Soviet Union, invested heavily in developing nuclear weapons, with the U.K., France, China, and later Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea building their own bombs. In the mid-1980s, global nuclear arsenals peaked at just over 70,000 warheads. Arms control treaties and diplomacy succeeded in reducing those numbers to roughly 12,200 today, nearly 90 percent of which are possessed by Russia and the United States.

While some argue that nuclear deterrence provides safety and security, many in the arms control and scientific communities believe that the threat of nuclear war has never been higher. In the first six months of 2025, five nuclear-armed countries (Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel, and the United States) have engaged in military hostilities or outright war, increasing the risk of nuclear war by accident, miscommunication, or design.

Last month, on the Trinity test anniversary, an assembly of more than a dozen Nobel Prize laureates and some 60 nuclear experts gathered for three days of discussions at the University of Chicago to come up with practical, actionable steps that can be taken now to reduce the risk of nuclear war.

The world's nine nuclear-armed nations are estimated to possess the destructive equivalent of 146,500 Hiroshima-sized bombs.

In a press conference, the group presented a two-page declaration for the prevention of nuclear war signed by 120 Nobel laureates representing six disciplines and at least 45 nuclear experts. Among their recommendations was a call for every nation to publicly recommit to all nonproliferation and disarmament objectives and obligations, to reiterate commitment to the nuclear explosive test moratorium, and for Russia and the U.S. to enter into immediate arms control negotiations. They also called on scientists, academics, civil society, and communities of faith to “create the necessary pressure on global leaders to implement nuclear risk reduction measures.”

Speaking at the university, Cardinal Silvano Maria Tomasi, an adviser to Pope Leo XIV said, “The Trinity explosion taught us what we are capable of destroying. The task before us now is to rediscover what we are capable of preserving and building.”

The choice of venues was intentional as the University of Chicago was where key steps in the Manhattan Project were achieved, where the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists was founded, and where the symbolic Doomsday Clock was created to communicate threats to humanity and the world. Today, the clock is set at 89 seconds to midnight — the closest it has ever been to global catastrophe.

Alexandra Bell, president and CEO of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, points out that the Chicago assembly wasn't the first time Nobel laureates have called for leaders to rein in nuclear dangers. But now, after decades of “slow, tedious, difficult progress” to create restraints to prevent a nuclear catastrophe, the world has reached a reckoning point: “Those [structures] are crumbling and we seem to be heading in the wrong direction,” she says.

Although we have the diplomatic and political tools as well as the historical background to reduce risks, Bell says today's leaders lack the necessary ambition and will. This raises the question: Will our luck hold out?

“The odds are not in our favor,” she says.

The last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the U.S. and Russia, the New START Treaty, will end in February 2026 unless it is renegotiated or replaced soon.

Yet even in the face of nuclear peril, she understands why people seem more concerned about the price of eggs. In addition to so many other concerns, Bell says, people still need to care about nuclear war because the threat has never gone away. She insists that ordinary people do have a role to play and can have an impact by pressuring elected officials or simply starting a conversation with each other.

“This affects all of us,” says Bell. “And if we get the nuclear problem wrong, nothing else matters.”

In a time of growing geopolitical tension and instability, when international norms are under stress, competition between nuclear weapon states means greater nuclear risks, says Mallory Stewart, executive vice president at the Council on Strategic Risks.

Stewart told Truthout that it's important to dispel the perception that nuclear risk reduction is an esoteric, political issue only for experts, and bring an end to public complacency: “It would be nice if the public felt some agency to say, ‘It's not as simple as arms racing. It's not as simple as might makes right. There is a deeper threat to humanity.'”

“The Trinity explosion taught us what we are capable of destroying. The task before us now is to rediscover what we are capable of preserving and building.”

“Growing reliance on nuclear weapons and modernization or more weapons will just lead to more weapons and modernization on the other side,” Stewart says.

James McKeon, a program officer for nuclear security at the Carnegie Corporation of New York, encourages people to educate themselves about arms control, nonproliferation, or the basics of nuclear technology. “It's no more complicated than any other scientific topic,” he says, pointing to resources that clearly explain the science, history, and policies of nuclear issues.

McKeon says we need new ways for artists, writers, and creative individuals to think about nuclear policy. An engaged citizenry, he says, is more likely to reach out to elected officials and understand that the risk of nuclear weapons hasn't gone away and is compounded by new technologies.

Robert Latiff is a retired major general in the Air Force who teaches weapons ethics and how new technology impacts the laws of armed conflict at Notre Dame University. “There is absolutely no ethical argument for nuclear weapons,” he says. He prefers not to call them “weapons” because they can't be used to fight a war. “They're more devices of terror than they are weapons,” he says. “Fight a war with nuclear weapons and what do you have left?”

Latiff points to George H. W. Bush's 1991 Presidential Nuclear Initiatives which took unilateral action to remove U.S. tactical nuclear weapons from Europe and South Korea. He says that with moral courage, a U.S. president could again have a huge impact on nuclear policy.

Wole Soyinka, a Nigerian playwright and recipient of the 1986 Nobel Prize for literature, also came to Chicago to grapple with how to reduce nuclear risks. “We do have an enhanced climate of fear right now,” he told Truthout.

This affects all of us. And if we get the nuclear problem wrong, nothing else matters.

“It isn't only global warming that we are witnessing. There's a certain heating up of, shall we say, human and social relationships and national interaction,” says Soyinka. He describes a “disturbing escalation of violence” and a “kind of demonic sweep of leadership” in which politicians blithely declare, “if necessary, I will use an atom bomb,” and display what he calls “boastful, arrogant, hubristic body language” and terms like “little rocket man” and “obliterating unilaterally.”

Since 2009, the African continent has been designated a nuclear-weapon-free zone under the Treaty of Pelindaba. Africa is often left out of the nuclear conversation, but it was in the colonized Algerian Sahara that France conducted 17 nuclear weapons tests in the 1960s over the protests of African nations.

“If there is an atomic war in Ukraine, even Africa would be affected. We probably see that reflected more and more in the literary arts as well as the graphic arts,” Soyinka says. “Many people still believe that political leaders are people of common sense and that has never happened. My imagination has gone over and beyond that, and I wake up sometimes wondering what will be the next global conflagration.”

Laura Grego from the Union of Concerned Scientists warns that when the U.S. military makes war plans, it doesn't include the full spectrum of what would happen in a nuclear war, saying, “I think they don't want to know the answer because it's terrible.”

Grego told Truthout that military expectations for nuclear war can be found in National Academies reports, which she believes likely undercount the long-term effects of radioactive fallout, possibly by as much as a factor of 10. Nuclear winter, major disruptions to agriculture, and mass starvation are long-term consequences of nuclear war that are usually not counted by military planners, Grego says. “We're running risks that we don't fully understand.”

We're a democracy and our responsibility is to make sure our policies align with our democratic values, with our hopes for the world, hopes for a long-term future for our children that is healthy, secure, and sustainable.”

The Nobel declaration calls on all nations to increase investment and cooperative research on the environmental, social, military, and economic impacts of nuclear conflict, and to support a UN Independent Scientific Panel on the Effects of Nuclear War.

Grego is also concerned about the expanding role of nuclear weapons. “Russia has recently changed their nuclear policy to say that they're meant to deter nuclear powers that are helping a non-nuclear adversary,” she says, adding that the role of nuclear weapons should be reduced and that by investing heavily in modernization, we are disincentivizing the reduction of nuclear weapons. Investing in nuclear weapons, she says, indicates we expect them to be around for another 80 years.

“We need to find a way to wean ourselves off the reliance of [nuclear weapons],” Grego says, noting that the leader of a major nuclear-armed country could transform the world by eliminating nuclear weapons with a verified plan and encouraging others to join them. Doing so, however, would surely mean facing powerful, determined opponents who are invested in maintaining the status quo. Grego hopes global leaders will demonstrate a commitment to political courage over simply seeking unilateral security advantages.

In her interactions with members of Congress, Grego says they report almost never hearing their constituents bring up nuclear weapons. It's not enough for the public to be scared or angry at how we've organized our security, she says. “We do need to further engage. We're a democracy and our responsibility is to make sure our policies align with our democratic values, with our hopes for the world, hopes for a long-term future for our children that is healthy, secure, and sustainable.”

Earlier this year, the Arab Gulf states were riding high. The energy crisis that followed the coronavirus pandemic had filled their coffers and renewed their roles as the stewards of global oil markets—and, in Qatar's case, a reliable source of liquefied natural gas. Over the past few years, the Gulf countries have tactfully navigated the great-power competition between China, Russia, and the United States and successfully managed their relations with regional rivals, including Iran and Turkey.

For the first major international trip of his second term, U.S. President Donald Trump visited Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. These countries seemed to be among the few U.S. partners that had cracked the code for dealing with Trump: striking headline-grabbing trillion-dollar megadeals while quietly catering to his family's business interests. In return for pledging to invest $2 trillion in the U.S. economy over the next four to ten years, the Arab Gulf states won massive arms deals, assurances of privileged access to advanced U.S. technologies, and promises that the United States would commit to a pragmatic approach to the Middle East that incorporated Gulf interests.

Arab Gulf states appeared well-positioned to use their wealth, energy resources, internal stability, and geographical centrality to transition into post-oil nations. They had already established themselves as finance and logistics hubs and had ambitions to further underpin their transformations with nascent advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence capabilities, the development of which depended on industrial partnerships with foreign companies that were testing what was politically acceptable in an era of great-power competition.

Instead, the Arab Gulf States must now grapple with the immediate and long-term consequences of a cascade of dreaded events against which they had warned their Western partners, especially the United States. In June, an intense 12-day war between Iran and Israel, in which the United States delivered major airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, ended with a barrage of intercepted Iranian ballistic missiles illuminating Qatar's night sky. The governments of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE had bet big on Trump in part because they hoped that he could end conflict in the region; that wager has clearly flopped, exposing the Gulf states' political and security vulnerabilities and showing that access to Trump does not always equate to leverage over his policies.

Although U.S. and Israeli strikes have probably degraded Iran's nuclear facilities, the war will likely only harden Iran's resolve to acquire a nuclear deterrent to protect against future attack—setting the stage for further rounds of conflict. Meanwhile, Tehran has demonstrated that it is willing and able to take the fight to its neighbors when attacked, offering a glimpse into the Islamic Republic's options for escalation should Israel or the United States do good on their threats of striking again. Few in the Gulf share the optimistic views in Tel Aviv and Washington that the war was a stunning and decisive success, that Iran has been durably chastened, and that the limited damage incurred in Qatar proves that Iran is toothless.

Being caught between a belligerent and unrestrained nuclear power (Israel) and a hostile neighbor (Iran) severely undercuts Gulf visions of national development and global interconnectedness. Look past the fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel and one can see the conditions for enduring uncertainty and future conflict: Iran's likely decision to start rebuilding its nuclear and missile programs, Israel's proclivity for preventive military aggression across the region (also shown by Israel's bombing of Syrian government facilities in Damascus in early July), and unpredictable U.S. leadership.

Although Iran has been bloodied, it remains largely functional and, like Iraq in the 1990s, has grown more steadfast in defeat. With European countries largely sidelined and the great powers at loggerheads, the Arab Gulf states should step in to mediate a lasting deal between Iran and the United States, however slim the chances of success. Failure could result in a perpetually unstable regional order characterized by enduring Iranian hostility, Israeli military dominance, and a United States utterly disinterested in managing the aftereffects of conflict—all of which bodes ill for the Gulf states' economic and security ambitions.

Gulf states once exhorted the United States to eliminate Iran's nuclear program—to “cut off the head of the snake,” as King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia put it in 2008—and rejected nuclear diplomacy with Iran during the Obama and first Trump administrations. But it has also longed for containing Iran's regional influence. The Arab Gulf states opposed the 2015 nuclear deal, for instance, for being too narrow in scope and for not requiring Iran to curb its aggression in the Middle East in return for normalizing relations with the West.

More recent developments have changed Gulf states' calculations. First, they began to doubt the United States' commitment to upholding the regional security order after Iran attacked Saudi oil installations in 2019. Trump, then in his first term, declined to protect the Saudis or respond with military force. If an administration Riyadh had aggressively courted failed to come to its aid, what did that augur for long-term security alignment between Washington and the Gulf? That the United States offers Israel unlimited military and political cover only compounds regional leaders' frustrations.

Sensing their physical and economic exposure to Iran and chastened by Washington's unreliability, Arab Gulf states orchestrated a thaw with Tehran. Riyadh's engagement efforts culminated in a Chinese-facilitated deal to normalize diplomatic relations in March 2023. Although displays of concord since then have been mostly for show, it is undeniable that Iranian-Saudi relations are better now than at any time in the past 20 years. More recently, this thaw resulted in most of the Arab Gulf states choosing not to participate in a U.S.-led campaign against the Houthis, an Iranian ally, in the Red Sea and Yemen. The Islamic Republic largely upheld its end of the bargain, keeping the Arab Gulf states out of its crosshairs as it exchanged blows with Israel and enabled the Houthis' campaign of harassment in the Red Sea. This equilibrium was only shaken after the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, after which Tehran attacked U.S. military installations located inside a major Qatari base—an outcome the Gulf states had tried to prevent by continually insisting that the United States not use Gulf bases or airspace for its operations.



Ironically, the Gulf states' thaw with Iran was aided by Israel's decimation of the Islamic Republic's regional network of allies in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria over the past couple years. With Tehran's regional capabilities severely limited, Gulf states have further softened their stance, so much so that they are now more willing to accept a deal that limits Iran's nuclear program but doesn't necessarily deny it the ability to enrich uranium for the country's medical research or energy needs.

But Israel's new regional ambitions and the United States' apparent facilitation of them—the same forces that have helped neutralize Iran's regional influence—now represent the main threats to the Gulf's chief concerns: the stability they require to export fossil fuels and the regional peace they seek in order to transition their economies to a post-oil future. Any lasting disruption to maritime traffic caused by renewed conflict would make it more difficult to transport oil and gas. A direct Iranian attack on their infrastructure and cities, meanwhile, would tarnish their image of safety and stability, which underpins their appeal to investors, multinational corporations, and tourists. That such an attack would also pose geopolitical downsides for Iran does not diminish the weight of the potential consequences.

All the Arab Gulf states condemned Israel's assault on Iran—even Bahrain and the UAE, both of which normalized relations with Israel in 2020. Saudi Arabia deemed the attacks “blatant Israeli aggressions against the brotherly Islamic Republic of Iran” and called them “a clear violation of international laws and norms.” Oman, which was meant to host the sixth round of U.S.-Iranian nuclear talks two days after Israel's first attack on Iran, accused Israel of seeking to deliberately “obstruct the diplomatic process and ignite a wider conflict.”

The Arab Gulf states did not want the war. In fact, they actively sought to avert it. Speaking at Davos in January, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan, stated, “A war between Iran and Israel […] is something we should try to avoid as much as possible.” A few days after the first U.S.-Iranian nuclear talks began in Oman, in April, Saudi Arabia's King Salman dispatched Khalid bin Salman, his son and the country's defense minister, to Tehran with an ominous warning for Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei: sign a deal with Trump or risk war with Israel.

The Arab Gulf states placed big bets on Trump's peacemaking credentials after he campaigned on promises of ending U.S. involvement in forever wars and defusing conflicts in Eurasia and the Middle East. “I don't see the incoming U.S. administration as contributory to the risk of war,” Farhan told a skeptical crowd at Davos. “On the contrary, President Trump has been quite clear he does not favor conflict.” It was a sentiment that senior Arab Gulf officials often repeated in private discussions. Trump, these officials believed, would stand up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in ways Joe Biden did not. If nothing else, they thought, Trump would be swayed by the prospect of lucrative deals with their countries.

Initially, such hopes seemed to pan out. Trump pushed Israel to accept a two-month ceasefire in Gaza and worked with Egypt and Qatar to achieve a lasting peace deal. The Trump administration also facilitated several rounds of nuclear talks with Iran and brokered a ceasefire with the Houthis that does not preclude Houthi strikes against Israel. During his visit to Riyadh in May, Trump—at the behest of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—met with Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and lifted U.S. sanctions on that country. Israel opposed the latter move and has launched hundreds of strikes on Syria since the Assad regime fell, in December. It has even captured and occupied some Syrian territory “indefinitely,” forestalling peace between the two countries.

But once Israel launched its strikes on Iran and the United States joined in, many illusions were shattered. The Arab Gulf states must contend once again with the harsh reality that the White House is not a reliable partner in either reining Israel in or bringing a lasting end to war in the region. Despite their disappointment, Gulf states must maintain a delicate balance that requires not antagonizing Trump. As such, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia all issued condemnations of the U.S. attack on Iran, but the criticism was pro forma and muted; Qatar didn't even mention the United States by name. A harsher denunciation may have jeopardized relations with Washington, the countries' main security partner, while war raged on in Iran and even caused Trump to lash out.

Rather than persuade Iran to shift course and abandon its pursuits of regional dominance and nuclear weapons, the 12-day war will have only confirmed the beliefs held by the regime's hardliners that the West is perfidious and diplomacy is futile. Trump's use of diplomacy as an instrument of misdirection—Israel attacked two days before a scheduled round of U.S.-Iranian nuclear talks—likely validated those Iranians who believed that the United States could not be trusted all along. Subsequent endorsements of Israel's attack by European Union member states, including France and Germany, as well as the United Kingdom will have disqualified such countries, in the Iranian view, as honest and credible intermediaries.

Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials made no secret of their desire to topple the Iranian regime. In remarks after Israel's first strikes, Netanyahu claimed that his country was “clearing the path” for Iranians' freedom from “an evil and oppressive regime.” Netanyahu did not rule out assassinating Khamenei, and Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, stated that the supreme leader “cannot continue to exist.” In a social media post following the U.S. air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, Trump indicated he might support regime change “if the current Iranian regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN.”

Having survived Israel's onslaught, however, the regime is likely to bolster its nuclear program and improve its missile capabilities to deter or retaliate against future attack. The Islamic Republic may emerge from the war in a state similar to Iraq's following the Gulf War: led by a paranoid and militarized regime that deals with internal dissent with an iron fist and holds regional de-escalation hostage to a greater struggle with Israel and the United States. It may dash for a nuclear bomb in a desperate attempt to build a deterrent or else pursue more aggressive nuclear brinksmanship to extract concessions from the international community.



Iran also has multiple escalatory options, including launching lethal attacks on U.S. bases and forces in the region, disabling the Arab Gulf states' energy infrastructure via attacks, and closing the Strait of Hormuz, through which most of the Arab Gulf states' oil and liquefied natural gas exports flow. Despite having dealt with maritime disruptions during the “tanker war” of the 1980s and Houthi attacks on Saudi energy installations in 2019, the ability of Arab Gulf states and their Western partners to swiftly address the effects of a full-scale war with Iran remain untested. Arab Gulf states would be deeply unnerved by an angry Iran that threatens its neighbors with short-range missiles and drones and disrupts maritime traffic in the Gulf. After all, these countries have watched the United States and the United Kingdom bomb the Houthis for more than a year and a half; although the strikes have degraded the Houthis' capabilities, they have ultimately failed to deter the group. Arab Gulf states also doubt that, in the event of future Iranian attacks on their countries, the United States will provide long-lasting military aid.

After its rapid and stunning military success, Israel may also feel further emboldened to resort to unprovoked military attacks rather than diplomacy. Like Iran, Israel views the region as an open theater of conflict, and it has carried out military operations in Gaza, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen with little regard for the attacks' legal merits or their effects on these countries' populations and neighbors. Arab Gulf states are deeply worried about Netanyahu's stated desire to “redraw” the Middle East, which would almost certainly ignore or downgrade their interests and could well re-energize the kinds of extremist forces that they have spent two decades fighting, including al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and the Islamic State (also known as isis). It conjures an image of Israel thriving as an impenetrable garrison easily managing the military threats of the fractured statelets surrounding it: a state of affairs that almost all countries in the region would regard as a recipe for permanent instability.

The Arab Gulf states' core strategic interest is denying any power—Iran, Israel, or even a third actor such as Turkey—the ability to dominate the region. They believed that Trump would help advance this vision by tying it to broader economic interests. But ultimately, Netanyahu's grand project won over the Oval Office. The Gulf states must now put on a brave face and plan for a more unstable Middle East.

Conditions are still in place for a repeat of direct hostilities between Iran and Israel, despite the former's weakened state. Iran remains intent on rebuilding its nuclear program and enriching uranium domestically, a position it held onto even at the height of the 12-day war. The status of key elements of the program, including the whereabouts of Tehran's stockpile of 60-percent-enriched uranium hexafluoride, the damage Israeli and U.S. bombardment did to its nuclear installations, and the state of any undeclared nuclear facilities, remains unclear.

Like Iraq in the 1990s, Iran may seek to conceal its nuclear program even further. The country has a long history of nuclear deception, and has routinely diverted material or failed to declare relevant facilities to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN organization responsible for certifying the “exclusively peaceful nature” of Iran's nuclear program. Iranian allegations that the agency served as an intelligence-gathering platform for Israel and the Iranian parliament's subsequent approval of a bill suspending cooperation with it both suggest that the Islamic Republic is even less likely to abide by transparency measures going forward. The ambiguity surrounding Iran's nuclear program will remain unsettling for its foes and for its Arab Gulf neighbors, which dread instability. Under Israel's Begin Doctrine, which prescribes preventive warfare against adversaries capable of developing weapons of mass destruction, further ambiguity over the state of Iran's nuclear program may serve as casus belli for future hostilities.

The Arab Gulf states must cool the rising temperatures and mitigate the increasing risks. In the absence of other credible intermediaries, they should attempt to facilitate a nuclear deal between Iran and the United States themselves. It's the only way to break the cycle of conflict and instability that plagues the region. And the Gulf states stand a better chance than most at success. Their principled positions on the U.S.-Israeli strikes lend credibility to their roles as honest brokers. Qatar's critical role in bringing the war to an end, largely by absorbing Iran's face-saving attack, will raise its political capital in Tehran. From Iran's perspective, Oman has established itself as a trusted intermediary, while the influence of Saudi Arabia and the UAE in Washington is a valuable asset, even if that influence appears to be diminishing.

Brokering a new U.S.-Iranian deal would be a herculean task. To do so the Arab Gulf states must exercise every lever of influence available to them in Washington, Tehran, and Tel Aviv to take the region off its war footing. Their futures depend on it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","As more young people get screened, more colon cancer is being found early. Here's how to lower your risk","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/04/health/colorectal-cancer-screening-trend","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT","


            Even more colorectal cancer cases are being found in adults under 50, and a new collection of research suggests that a surge in screening may be tied to many of the more recent diagnoses – but not the overall trend.
    


            In 2018, the American Cancer Society updated its guidelines for colon and rectal cancer screening, recommending that adults at average risk get screened starting at age 45 – earlier than 50, which was previously advised.
    


            Then, in 2021, the US Preventive Services Task force also lowered the recommended age to start screening for colon and rectal cancers from 50 to 45.
    


            The shift in screening guidelines is associated with a recent increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses, but it does not explain the rise among younger adults in general – a trend that began in the mid-1990s and includes late-stage cancers, as well. Colorectal cancer refers to colon cancer, which starts in the colon, and rectal cancer, which starts in the rectum.
    


            “The drivers of rising incidence are still unknown, but many research efforts are ongoing, with investigations covering the gamut from microplastics to ultra processed food and many other gut exposures introduced in the last half of the 20th century, when this began,” Elizabeth Schafer, associate scientist of surveillance and health equity science at the American Cancer Society, said in an email.
    


Colorectal cancer is on the rise in young adults: What to know and how to help



            Lowering the screening age “has likely facilitated earlier detection of cancers that might have been missed,” but there is still more work to do to identify the driving factors behind the ongoing overall rise of colorectal cancer in younger ages, Dr. Joseph Rinaldi, a gastroenterologist at Montefiore Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center, said in an email.
    


            “It is likely that factors beyond screening guidelines are contributing to the overall rise in colorectal cancer incidence,” Rinaldi said. “Much work remains to identify causal factors – whether environmental, genetic, or population-based – that can be targeted for prevention and, potentially, reversal of this trend.”
    


            Now, research conducted by the American Cancer Society that was published Monday in the medical journal JAMA found that the share of US adults ages 45 to 49 who are up to date on colorectal cancer screening climbed from 20.8% in 2019 and 19.7% in 2021 to 33.7% in 2023.
    


            “We've been waiting for screening to take off in this age group,” Schafer, an author on the new screening study, said in the email. “But the real thrill is the translation to early diagnosis, which means less intense treatment and lives saved.”
    


New research presents promising findings on colorectal cancer treatment and prevention



            A second study, also conducted by the American Cancer Society and published Monday in JAMA, found that the prevalence of early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among adults 45 to 49 increased from 9.4 cases per 100,000 people in 2019 to 11.7 per 100,000 in 2021 and then to 17.5 per 100,000 in 2022.
    


            That translates to a 50% relative increase between 2021 and 2022.
    


            “If screening was the cause of the rise, the increase would have been for early- instead of late-stage disease,” said Schafer, lead author of the second paper.
    


            “Local stage diagnosis was rare in this age group before screening because there are usually no symptoms yet,” Schafer said of early-stage cancers that have not spread to other parts of the body. “So yes, it was a bit shocking, actually, to see early-stage incidence double from 9.4 to 17.5 per 100,000 in this newly screened group.”
    


            As a rise in colon and rectal cancers persists among younger adults, public health experts now urge them to know the warning signs and to get screened when eligible.
    


            More than half of the people who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer before 50 are not eligible for screening because they haven't yet reached the recommended age of 45. And most people who are eligible have still not been screened, said Jessica Star, associate scientist of cancer risk factors and screening surveillance research at the American Cancer Society, who was lead author on the new screening study and an author on the other paper.
    


            Whether someone is recommended for screening or not, they should still watch for signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer and talk with their doctor if they notice any, she said.
    


            In the United States, about 1 in 23 men and 1 in 25 women will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in their lifetime.
    


            The most common symptom is rectal bleeding,” Star said in an email, adding that 41% of patients under 50 tend to experience this symptom, compared with 26% of patients older than 50. Many people also may have abdominal cramping or pain.
    


            “Young people, especially, are reluctant to talk about these types of symptoms, but it could actually save their life,” Star said.



            “Other important symptoms include a persistent change in bowel habits or the shape of stool, decreased appetite, and weight loss. People with any of these symptoms that persist for several weeks should be followed up with a doctor's visit,” she said. “If you are young and your concerns are not being addressed, get a second opinion. There are too many stories about young people being told they have hemorrhoids, finding out months or years later that it is cancer.”
    


Immunotherapy helps certain cancer patients avoid surgery: ‘We hope this is the future'



            When Kelly Spill, 33, experienced symptoms of colorectal cancer after the birth of her first child, she said, her doctors told her that they were tied to being postpartum and internal hemorrhoids.
    


            “One day I went to the bathroom, and I looked down, and you would have thought it was my time of the month, and it most certainly was not. That's when it became extremely alarming,” Spill told CNN in May of the blood in her stool.
    


            When she noticed massive amounts of blood again, she took photos and showed them to a primary care physician. The doctor immediately ordered a colonoscopy, and that's what led to her being diagnosed with stage III rectal cancer at age 28 in 2020.
    


            “To self-advocate is such a big one,” Spill said. “If I didn't push, push, push, I don't know where I would be, and especially as a new mom.”
    


            Spill was treated with an immunotherapy drug called dostarlimab and is now a healthy mother of three. She remains cancer-free.
    


            Getting screened can help reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, because almost all colorectal cancers begin as precancerous polyps in the colon or rectum. But through screening, these polyps can be identified and removed before they turn cancerous.
    


            Current options for colorectal cancer screening for people at average risk include a stool-based fecal test either annually or every three years; a traditional colonoscopy every 10 years; a virtual colonoscopy every five years; or a sigmoidoscopy procedure, which involves using a tube-like instrument called an endoscope to examine the lower part of the colon, every five years.
    


            A separate study published Monday in JAMA found that when people newly eligible for screening were automatically mailed a fecal test kit at their home address without asking for it, they were more likely to complete screening than those who were asked to actively choose between a colonoscopy, a fecal test or deferring screening altogether.
    


            “Another important question is how to get more people screened, especially people without access to healthcare, a group that had no significant increase in screening in our study,” Schafer, who was not involved in that study, said in the email.
    


            Despite recent increases in screening, it's still estimated that more than 1 in 3 adults 45 and older are not getting screened as recommended, according to the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable.
    


Reduce your risk of colon and rectal cancer with these basic steps



            There are other steps people can take to help prevent colorectal cancer.
    


            “There are many things people of all ages can do to reduce their risk, including not smoking, maintaining a healthy body weight, being physically active, avoiding excessive alcohol consumption, and eating a healthy diet that is low in red and processed meat and high in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables,” Star said.
    


            More than half of all colorectal cancers in the US are attributable to those modifiable risk factors, according to the American Cancer Society.
    


            “There have been several studies that work to identify factors contributing to the development of colon cancer. Maintaining a physically active lifestyle and a healthy weight is important, as obesity has been linked to early-onset disease,” Rinaldi said. “I also encourage avoiding tobacco, refined grains, and sugary beverages and instead focus on consuming a fiber-rich diet that is more plant-based and that limits the consumption of red and processed meats, as this is thought to be protective to colon health.”

            It was just after 7 p.m. on a Monday when staff at the Korian Les Amarantes nursing home in Tours, southwest of Paris, discovered 92-year-old Yvette Brisset dead in her bed. She had apparently choked on a madeleine — one of France's famed scallop-shaped, lemon-flavored cakes.
    


            The cake had been brought to her earlier that evening by a man named Alain Jousselin.
    


            Jousselin, then 60, wasn't a family member or friend. He was a former firefighter who had bought Brisset's home 25 years earlier through a little-known French property scheme known as viager — and had been waiting ever since to move in, his lawyer, Abed Benjador, told CNN.
    


            In a viager sale, elderly homeowners — often in their 70s, 80s or 90s — sell their properties at a steep discount, sometimes for half the market value. In return, they receive a monthly payment from the buyer. In most cases, they retain the right to live in the home for the rest of their lives — an arrangement known as viager occupé. In other instances, the vendor has already moved out at the time of sale, allowing the buyer to take immediate possession of the property while continuing the monthly payments — a setup known as viager libre.
    


            It's part real estate, part roulette. Property listings typically include the seller's age alongside the asking price. The older the seller, the sooner the buyer might potentially claim the home.
    


            “In France, a 70-year-old man has a life expectancy of around 16 years, so the discount is often 50%,” said Fréderic Coubronne, who runs a viager agency in Paris. “Women live about five years longer, so a 75-year-old woman would have the same discount. For couples, the discount is even higher, since they tend to live longer together.”
    


            Jousselin had bought Brisset's family home in Montbazon, just south of Tours, in 1995. Ever since, he had been paying Brisset a monthly stipend of 500 euros — a total of well over $150,000, at today's conversion rates, on top of the initial purchase sum. When she died, on May 13, 2019, suspicion quickly turned toward him, his lawyer said.
    


            No one in the family knew Jousselin before Brisset's death, her granddaughter, Emiline Dupoy, wrote in a letter published by French newspaper La Nouvelle Republique ahead of Jousselin's trial. “The only link between them was the viager.”
    


            “It was a huge scandal,” Benjador told CNN. “The nursing home staff claimed Jousselin locked the door behind him when he entered the room. After he left, they said they found Madame Brisset with madeleine crumbs all over her body.”
    


She ditched New York for Paris at the age of 79 and says it's the best decision she's ever made



            French media dubbed the case l'affaire de la madeleine. “At the heart of the trial is the viager property purchased in the 1990s,” the French outlet RTL reported.
    


            Jousselin spent three years in pretrial detention before the case first went to court in May 2022. He was acquitted by the Indre-et-Loire Court of Appeal, but prosecutors challenged the verdict. Attorney General Denis Chaussetie-Laprée called for a 20-year prison sentence, arguing that the killing of the elderly woman had been “premeditated.”
    


            But during the retrial in December 2023, held at the Loiret Court of Appeal, key testimony from nursing staff began to unravel, casting doubt on the original narrative.
    


            “I don't know if my client killed her intentionally,” Benjador said. “But I do know that the procedure was flawed, and much more complicated than the press made it seem. The viager issue overshadowed everything.”
    


            On December 9, 2023, the murder charge against Jousselin was downgraded to involuntary manslaughter.  While prosecutors could not prove he intended to kill the victim, the Loiret Court of Appeal accepted that Jousselin had given Brisset a madeleine — describing it as an act of “imprudence” directly linked to her death.
    


            Jousselin was sentenced to three years in prison and fined 30,000 euros, the court confirmed to CNN. “I'm somewhat relieved, but not entirely happy — I was still convicted, though I was facing much more serious charges,” he said as he left the courtroom.
    


            While trials like Jousselin's involving viager sales are disturbing, they remain extremely rare. And they haven't dampened enthusiasm for the housing arrangement — especially among foreign buyers eager to pick up French property at below-market prices.
    


            “Over the past two years, I've had around a dozen international buyers — about half of them American,” said Reza Nakhai, who owns a Paris-based agency called Viva Viager. “Many don't hesitate to invest. It's a secure, long-term bargain.”
    


            For Americans dreaming of a pied-à-terre in Paris, viager could be a golden ticket — if they're willing to play the long game.
    


            In Saint-Germain-des-Prés, the chic Left Bank enclave once home to Ernest Hemingway and Simone de Beauvoir, a 100-square-meter apartment now sells for an average of $1.7 million. In Le Marais — a favorite among both the Parisian It crowd and American buyers — 2025 prices range from $15,500 to $22,000 per square meter, according to real estate agency Talvan's International. But with viager, buyers can snap up prime real estate for less than half that price.
    


‘I was free to recreate myself': This American woman says that relocating to France at the age of 80 saved her life



            Homa Raevel, an American-Iranian investor and mother of five, has bought four viager properties in Paris. She first discovered the concept while living between Europe and the US, looking for creative ways to invest.
    


            “At first, it felt a little morbid,” Raevel told CNN. “I kept thinking, ‘I don't want to be happy when someone dies'. But I made it a point to meet every seller, hear their story. With viager, you're helping older people stay in their homes while giving them financial security — it's a win-win.”
    


            When scouting a property, the first things Raevel says she looks for are location and layout. “In France, especially in Paris, you often find kitchens at one end of the flat and dining rooms at the other, connected by narrow hallways,” she said. “I look for apartments with high ceilings and an open floor plan, often in up-and-coming areas.”
    


            But Raevel said the most crucial factor isn't the space itself — it's the seller. “I only buy if the seller seems to be living a happy life,” she said. “If someone is dealing with family conflicts or selling under stressful circumstances, I'll pass. The person needs to have good energy.”
    


            The practice of viager itself dates back to Roman times. “Back then, elderly people would pass on property to their children or nephews in exchange for a small sum and the ability to continue living in their homes,” the agent Coubronne told CNN.
    


            In the early 19th century, Napoleon formalized the system — not only in France but in the territories he conquered. “That's why you also find viager-style arrangements in countries like Spain, Italy and parts of Belgium,” Coubronne said.
    


            Viager sales aren't just popular among ordinary citizens — they've also attracted some of France's most prominent figures. Former presidents Charles de Gaulle, Valérie Giscard d'Estaing and François Hollande all acquired properties through viager arrangements. And it's not just the French embracing the practice. Hugh Hefner made headlines when he sold the Playboy Mansion to his neighbor for $100 million — half its $200 million listing price — on one condition: he would live there until the day he died.
    


            In France, the centuries-old system is especially popular among homeowners without heirs.
    


            “If I had children, I'd want them to inherit,” said André Helman, a 74-year-old psychoanalyst who recently sold his Paris apartment as a viager. “But I don't, so this is the perfect solution — it lets me stay in my home and live comfortably on a steady income.”
    


‘It really fits us': They traded South Florida for the South of France



            Helman's one-bedroom flat was purchased for 250,000 euros — around half its market value — by Ylla Heron, a 21-year-old fashion student.
    


            “I don't need to live here right now,” she told CNN. “It's for the future, in 20 or 30 years. Given the price and the surface area — 46 square meters in the center of Paris — it's a real bargain.”
    


            Perched on the ninth floor of a modern building in Paris' 14th arrondissement — a vibrant neighborhood south of the Seine, known for its artistic heritage, Haussmannian facades and classic café culture — the apartment instantly charmed Heron. “It's beautiful and cozy,” she said. “There's a big window that floods the space with light, and the view over the rooftops of Paris is magical. I can really imagine myself living here someday.”
    


            The viager system isn't without its critics. Some see the system as morbid, given that the buyer's investment depends on the seller's demise. Helman isn't fazed.
    


            “People are uncomfortable with viager because of the death aspect,” he said. “But for me, dying is a natural part of life. The idea that this charming young woman will eventually live in my home — it's actually very pleasant to me.”
    


            The system may prove a timely solution for France's rapidly aging population. As of January 2024, more than 20% of French residents are over 65 — with 10% aged 75 and older — according to national statistics agency INSEE. By 2050, one in three residents will be over 65. As living costs rise, securing stable finances in later life is becoming increasingly urgent.
    


            But viager isn't without risk for the buyer. In addition to paying a lump-sum down payment — poetically referred to as le bouquet — buyers must make monthly payments that could stretch decades.
    


            “I always calculate for the seller living to 100,” Raevel told CNN. “If they live beyond that, I might not make a profit. But as long as the market holds over the next 20 years, I'll still come out ahead.”
    


            Not all bets pay off.
    


            In one of the most famous cases, Jeanne Calment  — who holds the record as the world's longest-living person — signed a viager contract aged 90. She lived another 32 years, outlasting the buyer by two. His family was legally required to continue making monthly payments until Calment's death at 122.
    


            “That's the ultimate exception,” Nakhai told CNN, laughing. “I've never seen anything like that with my clients. But it shows how human this business really is. I've been invited to the funerals of sellers by their families. Viager is more than a property transaction — it's about trust and connection.”
    


            For Raevel, the American investor, it's also a matter of values.
    


            “Buying a viager feels good because I know I'm genuinely helping someone,” she said. “Many older people struggle to maintain the quality of life they had decades ago — they're really suffering. This way, I'm supporting someone while securing a long-term home at a lower price. Why wouldn't you take the bet?”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Trump's rewriting of reality on jobs numbers is chilling, but it could backfire","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/04/politics/trump-job-numbers-federal-reserve-analysis","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 04:01:00 GMT","


            When authoritarianism encroaches, apologists often present a strongman's power grabs as rational — even imperative for the national good.
    


            Top Trump administration aides followed that playbook on Sunday, justifying the president's abrupt firing of the government's top labor official in charge of employment statistics over jobs numbers that dented his proclamation of a new “golden age.”
    


            But the ouster of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, taken alongside President Donald Trump's concurrent bid to destroy the independence of the Federal Reserve, threatens the US economy's reputation as a bulwark of stability and integrity that has undergirded generations of prosperity.
    


            Such political interference might bolster Trump's ever-growing power. But it could backfire by eroding the trust of investors, companies and organizations that depend on accurate and truthful statistics on the economy's health to make major decisions that can impact the lives of millions of people. Even the Federal Reserve uses it to decide on monetary policy.
    


Trump says the Bureau of Labor Statistics orchestrated a ‘scam.' Here's how the jobs report really works



            And when countries don't firewall official data, they risk ending up like Argentina or Greece, where the invention of rosy statistics masked economic malaise and sparked financial crises. Or China, where fantastical official figures designed to bolster the regime's credibility fostered corruption — and benefited the US by comparison.
    


            Trump's assault on the BLS is also more than a narrow economic question. It's the latest erratic move by a president who believes he has total power and is immune from consequences, and who has become increasingly hubristic following a string of political wins this summer.
    


            Trump's domination of Congress and testing of constitutional limits have compromised constraints on presidential authority in a nation founded on the rejection of punitive and impetuous economic decisions by an all-powerful ruler.
    


            His quest for omnipotence across society can also be seen in his successful attempts to impose his ideology on top universities, his coercion of big-time law firms and his attacks on the media. Mirroring his assault on economic data, Trump and his aides have launched a purge of government scientists and experts whose findings conflict with the MAGA movement's doctrine on climate and vaccines. And while Republican presidents have sometimes had a point in arguing that their goals can be thwarted by a bureaucracy that they regard as overly liberal, Trump's assault on the federal government that he leads has funneled ever more unaccountable power into the Oval Office.
    


            But the president is taking a big economic risk.
    


            In the short term, his attack on the credibility of government data may exacerbate the economic uncertainty already gathering around the White House and darkening GOP prospects in next year's midterm elections.
    


            “BLS is the finest statistical agency in the entire world. Its numbers are trusted all over the world,” former Commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics William Beach told Kasie Hunt on CNN's “State of the Union.”  “I do believe, though, that the president's attack on the commissioner and on the bureau is undermining that infrastructure, could undermine that trust over the long term.”
    


            Senior Trump aides went onto Sunday shows to make a case for his volatile reaction to the jobs numbers that subverted his own version of reality.
    


            “The president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers, they're more transparent and more reliable,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House Economic Council, said Sunday on NBC's “Meet the Press.”
    


            On Monday, Hassett went even further, making a remarkable statement for someone in his position. Without offering any evidence, Hassett alleged in a CNBC interview that the jobs numbers could be “politically manipulated because they're so untransparent.”
    


            “There's a black box system out there making the jobs numbers that needs to be improved,” Hassett continued.
    


            Senate Democratic Minority leader Chuck Schumer responded to Hassett's defense of Trump's move by demanding his dismissal. “Kevin Hassett should be fired. He is defending Trump's lies about the jobs report and the firing of Erika McEntarfer,” Schumer wrote on X Monday.
    


            “The business community should demand a flack like him has no role at the Fed.”
    


            Another top Trump official, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, argued on Sunday that “you want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers.” He said on CBS' “Face the Nation” that “there are always revisions, but sometimes, you see these revisions go in really extreme ways. … The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch.”
    


            Trump was irked by job data that showed the economy created only 73,000 jobs in July. The monthly totals for May and June were also revised downward by a combined 258,000 jobs. Such recalculations are integral to the bureau's task of presenting an accurate picture of the economy over the longer term, and not just month to month. In this case, the jobs numbers appeared to confirm other indicators that contradict Trump's claims the economy is roaring, amid data showing slowing growth and a rise in inflation last month.
    


            One big danger now is that Trump's economic fabulism will gather its own momentum and infect confidence in government statistics that will long outlive his presidency. Employment data is published as part of a multilayered process that would be almost impossible for one official to corrupt. But if Trump appoints a politicized official to head the BLS with an incentive to please him, the pressure on officials to produce corrupted data would be intense. If jobs numbers are worse next month, will he fire someone else? And if the numbers improve, will anyone believe in their integrity?
    


            “Suppose that they get a new commissioner, and this person, male or female, are just the best people possible, right? And they do a bad number. Well, everybody's going to think, ‘Well, it's not as bad as it probably really is,' because they're going to suspect political influence,” Beach said on “State of the Union.”
    


            The president's turn against his own government's nonpartisan number-crunchers when they produced a report that he didn't like was rather predictable.
    


            In 2018, he coaxed supporters from the real world into his illusory political environment, saying, “Just remember, what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening.”
    


            This mantra was borne out during his first term.
    


            In his first hours in office, Trump furiously ignited a controversy over the size of the crowd at his inauguration, which he claimed, despite photographic evidence, was the biggest ever. At the time, this seemed an absurd sideshow. But it turned out to set the stage for an entire presidency of fabricating facts.
    


            His attempt now to invent jobs numbers that fit with his version of reality recalls his negligent handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Trump frequently claimed that if the US stopped testing for the virus, it would simply have no more cases.
    


            And Trump's claim that Friday's jobs numbers were “rigged” recalls his greatest-ever attack on truth: his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. When voters produced a result that he didn't like, he attempted to destroy the credibility of the system that produced it and to fix the outcome.
    


            Memories of 2020 are especially sobering in the light of Friday's developments because of the way Trump's personal embarrassments often lead him to pursue authoritarian outcomes.
    


            Often, Trump's critics have proclaimed that authoritarianism is on the march whatever he does. There's an entire political and media industrial complex devoted to the idea that Americans are already living under a dictatorship.
    


            There's no comparison to the one-party police state endured by citizens of China. The dynastic tyranny of North Korea has no echoes in the United States, and this country is far short of the psychological torture suffered by the people of Myanmar, who live under a pervasive, repressive state. But Trump's actions are adding to growing evidence that he is engineering a degradation of democratic and pluralistic institutions. Comparisons between the president and populist authoritarian strongmen leaders such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán or Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan look increasingly apt.
    


            The new controversy over jobs numbers comes at a moment when the second Trump administration is acting almost without restraint.
    


            Trump single-handedly remade the global trading system by imposing tariffs, apparently according to his whims, while completely bypassing a genuflecting GOP Congress that has done nothing to defend its constitutional authority to dictate policy in that area.
    


            His transformation of the intelligence services into a vessel for his political convenience has led to false claims and probes accusing President Barack Obama's administration of treason over Russian election meddling in 2016.
    


            Trump's weaponization of the Justice Department is creating immense suspicion after Ghislaine Maxwell was moved to a more lenient prison after two days of talks with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. Trump is struggling to end a political crisis over his ties to her late associate Jeffrey Epstein, an accused sex trafficker and convicted sex offender.
    


            And on Sunday, Trump's demands for a rewriting of congressional districts in Texas to make it easier for Republicans to cling onto the House next year precipitated a political crisis that is now having national implications.
    


            Trump's second term has often seemed like an attempt to recast the world as he'd prefer it to be. He's pardoned or released criminals convicted in connection with the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. The Pentagon has removed photos of top brass who contradicted him from its walls. And Trump has repeatedly attacked judges and claimed their actions are illegal as part of a pattern of behavior that CNN's Aaron Blake has justifiably called Orwellian.
    


            An apparent sense that there's no restraint on his power now seems to be feeding into Trump's foreign policy.
    


            Angered by Russia's failure to sign up to his Ukraine peace plan, Trump last week reacted to threats by former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev by saying he'd repositioned US nuclear submarines.
    


            Medvedev is now mostly known as an online troll and has only a minor position in Russian politics, so it's hard to understand why Trump was so easily goaded. And Trump's reaction ignored the fact that submarines that prowl the oceans in silence, carrying the second tier of the US nuclear deterrent, are constantly in position to fire off their missiles. But the spectacle of an American president indulging in nuclear saber-rattling, just before this week's 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, was chilling.
    


            Meanwhile, Trump had a volcanic reaction following a rare show of dissent from Capitol Hill when Democrats, using their minority privileges in the Senate, blocked an attempt to ram through his conservative judicial nominees before the summer recess. Trump on Saturday told Schumer to “GO TO HELL!” after the collapse of a deal to swap some nominee confirmations for the restoration of some government funding cuts.
    


            Such an extreme reaction to a rather routine example of congressional gridlock only underscores how Trump has become used to getting his way.
    


            And he's determined that no one will stop him.

Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says he will begin trying to remove Democratic lawmakers from office Monday if they don't return after dozens of them left the state in a last-resort attempt to block redrawn U.S. House maps that President Donald Trump wants before the 2026 midterm elections.

Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says he will begin trying to remove Democratic lawmakers from office Monday if they do not return after dozens of them left the state in an attempt to block the adoption of redrawn U.S. House maps sought by President Donald Trump.

Some of the lawmakers, including those who left Sunday for Illinois or New York, clapped back, accusing Abbott of using “smoke and mirrors” to make threats that go beyond his legal authority.

The revolt by Democrats in the state House and Abbott's threat ratcheted up a widening fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but expanded to include Democratic governors who have floated the possibility of rushing to redraw their own state maps in retaliation. But their options are limited.

The dispute also offers another example of Trump's aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the longstanding balance of powers between the federal government and individual states.

“We're not going to tolerate our democracy being stolen in a modern-day stagecoach heist by bunch of law breaking cowboys,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday, flanked by several of the lawmakers who fled. “If Republicans are willing to rewrite rules to give themselves an advantage, then they're leaving us with no choice: We must do the same. You have to fight fire with fire.”




At the center of the escalating impasse is Trump's hope of adding five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas before the 2026 midterm elections. That would bolster his party's chances of preserving its slim U.S. House majority. Republicans currently hold 25 of the state's 38 seats.

A vote on the proposed maps was set for Monday in the Texas House, but it cannot proceed if Democratic members deny a quorum by going to another state, which puts them beyond the reach of Texas law enforcement.

After one group of Democrats landed Sunday in Chicago, they were welcomed by Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, but declined to say how long they were prepared to stay away from Texas.

“We will do whatever it takes. What that looks like, we don't know,” said state Rep. Gene Wu, the Texas House Democratic Caucus leader.

But legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, including in 2021 when many of the same Texas House Democrats left the state for 38 days to protest new voting restrictions. Once they returned, Republicans still passed that measure.

Four years later, Abbott is taking a far more aggressive stance and warning Democrats that he will seek to remove them from office if they are not back when the House reconvenes Monday. He cited a nonbinding 2021 legal opinion issued by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton that suggested a court could determine that a legislator had forfeited their office.

He also suggested the lawmakers may have committed felonies by raising money to help pay for fines they could face.

“This truancy ends now,” Abbott said. 

House Democrats issued a four-word statement: “Come and take it.” And some lawmakers who relocated to other states taunted the governor in response.

“He has no legal mechanism,” said Texas Rep. Jolanda Jones, one of the lawmakers who was in New York. “Subpoenas from Texas don't work in New York, so he can't come and get us. Subpoenas in Texas don't work in Chicago. ... He's putting up smoke and mirrors.”

Lawmakers cannot pass bills in the 150-member Texas House without at least two-thirds of them present. Democrats hold 62 of the seats in the majority-Republican chamber, and at least 51 left the state, said Josh Rush Nisenson, spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus. 

Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows said the chamber would still meet as planned on Monday afternoon.

“If a quorum is not present then, to borrow the recent talking points from some of my Democrat colleagues, all options will be on the table,” he posted on X.

Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, said on X that Democrats who “try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately.”

A refusal by Texas lawmakers to show up is a civil violation of legislative rules. The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to “physically compel the attendance” of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served.

Two years later, Republicans pushed through new rules that allow daily fines of $500 for lawmakers who don't show up for work as punishment.

The lack of a quorum will also delay votes on disaster assistance and new warning systems in the wake of last month's catastrophic floods in Texas that killed at least 136 people. Democrats had called for votes on the flooding response before taking up redistricting and have criticized Republicans for not doing so.

Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential contender who has been one of Trump's most outspoken critics during his second term, had been in quiet talks with Texas Democrats for weeks about offering support if they chose to leave the state.

Last week, the governor hosted several Texas Democrats in Illinois to publicly oppose the redistricting effort, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom held a similar event in his own state.

Pritzker also met privately with Texas Democratic Chair Kendall Scudder in June to begin planning for the possibility that lawmakers would depart for Illinois if they decided to deny a quorum to block the map, according to a person with direct knowledge who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.

“This is not just rigging the system in Texas, it's about rigging the system against the rights of all Americans for years to come,” Pritzker said Sunday night.

Trump is looking to avoid a repeat of his first term, when Democrats flipped the House just two years into his presidency, and he hopes the new Texas map will aid that effort. Trump officials have also looked at redrawing lines in other states.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — India and the Philippines have staged joint naval exercises in the disputed South China Sea for the first time, a high-profile military deployment that antagonized China. Beijing has separate territorial disputes with the two Asian democracies and a long-running regional rivalry with New Delhi.

Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Gen. Romeo Brawner said Monday that the two-day joint naval sail and exercises which began Sunday went successfully, and expressed hopes that Filipino forces could engage India's military in more joint maneuvers in the future.

Asked if Chinese forces carried out any action in response, Brawner said without elaborating that “we did not experience any untoward incident but we were still shadowed. We expected that already.”

Two Chinese navy ships, including a guided-missile destroyer, were spotted about 25 nautical miles (46 kilometers) from one of two Philippine navy frigates that participated in the joint sail on Sunday, the Philippine military said.

The Chinese military's Southern Theater Command said it conducted routine patrols in the South China Sea on Sunday and Monday and added that it remains resolute in defending China's territory and maritime rights and interests.

Without mentioning India by name, the Southern Theater Command accused the Philippines of drawing in outside countries to organize joint patrols that it said undermine regional peace and stability.

China's Foreign Ministry said territorial disputes should be resolved by those directly involved without any third-party intervention.




China has a longstanding land border dispute with India in the Himalayas, which sparked a monthlong war in 1962 and a number of deadly firefights since then.

Separately, Beijing's expansive claims to virtually the entire South China Sea, a key global trade route, have led to tense confrontations with other claimant states, particularly the Philippines and Vietnam. Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also lay claims to parts of the contested waters.

The Philippines has staged naval patrols in the disputed waters with its treaty ally, the United States, and other strategic partners including Japan, Australia, New Zealand and France to promote freedom of navigation and overflight and strengthen deterrence against China.

It has allowed journalists to join territorial sea and aerial patrols to witness China's increasingly aggressive actions, provoking angry Chinese reactions.

In response to a question last week about Manila's plans to build up military cooperation, China's Ministry of National Defense called the Philippines a “troublemaker” that has aligned itself with foreign forces to stir up trouble in what China deems its own territorial waters.

Brawner said the Philippines has to boost deterrence to prevent war. “The way to do that is, number one, the Armed Forces of the Philippines has to be strengthened through modernization, and secondly, we need to partner with like-minded nations and that's what we're doing with India,” he said last week.

During a reception on board an Indian navy tanker, the INS Shakti, on Thursday, Brawner said the vessel's port call in Manila was more than ceremonial. It “sends a powerful signal of solidarity, strength in partnership and the energy of cooperation between two vibrant democracies in the Indo-Pacific,” he said.

Brawner welcomed the deepening of relations between the two Asian countries and “reaffirmed the shared commitment to maritime security, regional stability and a rules-based international order in one of the world's most geopolitically sensitive regions.”

Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos left Monday for a five-day state visit to India for talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top officials to boost defense, trade and investment, agriculture, tourism and pharmaceutical industry engagements.

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia. 

“China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,” China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff. 

“Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,” the ministry said.

The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable — after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the “Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.”

“We don't want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,” Bessent said.

◆ Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel.

On Thursday, he called the Chinese “tough” negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. “I believe that we have the makings of a deal,” Bessent told CNBC.




Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Donald Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. “Realizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance” for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.

In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.

When Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to U.S. pressure.

“If the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China's consistent official stance,” said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization. 

Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.

Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Trump, Kennedy said. 

Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as “the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.” He said Trump has made it clear he wants a “headline-grabbing deal” with Xi, “so rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal‑breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.”

Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's “strategic solidarity” with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said. 

“Beijing simply can't afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,” he said. “It's too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire‑sale prices.” 

A 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 80% to 90% of the oil exported by Iran went to China. The Chinese economy benefits from the more than 1 million barrels of Iranian oil it imports per day.

After the Iranian parliament floated a plan to shut down the Strait of Hormuz in June following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, China spoke out against closing the critical oil transit route. 

China also is an important customer for Russia, but is second to India in buying Russian seaborne crude oil exports. In April, Chinese imports of Russian oil rose 20% over the previous month to more than 1.3 million barrels per day, according to the KSE Institute, an analytical center at the Kyiv School of Economics.

This past week, Trump said the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India's purchasing of Russian oil. India's Foreign Ministry said Friday its relationship with Russia was “steady and time-tested.”

Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and a top policy adviser, said Trump has been clear that it is “not acceptable” for India to continue financing the Ukraine war by purchasing oil from Russia.

“People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil,” Miller said on Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures.” He said the U.S. needs “to get real about dealing with the financing of this war.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, is pushing for sanctions and tariffs on Russia and its financial backers. In April, he introduced a bill that would authorize the president to impose tariffs as high as 500% not only on Russia but on any country that “knowingly” buys oil, uranium, natural gas, petroleum products or petrochemical products from Russia.

“The purpose of this legislation is to break the cycle of China — a communist dictatorship — buying oil below market price from Putin's Russia, which empowers his war machine to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians,” Graham said in a June statement.

The bill has 84 co-sponsors in the 100-seat Senate. A corresponding House version has been introduced, also with bipartisan support.

Republicans say they stand ready to move on the sanctions legislation if Trump asks them to do so, but the bill is on hold for now.

Noah Lyles landed the day's biggest blow on the track, passing Kenny Bednarek for the win, then looking his way to talk some trash.

Bednarek's answer was a two-handed shove in the back after the finish line, some more heated words and a challenge for a rematch that can't come soon enough. 

U.S. track championships turned physical Sunday, with Lyles and Bednarek getting involved in a shoving and shouting match as they crossed the finish line of a hotly contested 200-meter final at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon.

“Like I've said before, Noah's going be Noah,” Bednarek said. “If he wants to stare me down, that's fine.”

Lyles reeled in Bednarek and crossed in 19.63 seconds for a .04-second victory that sets up a rematch at world championships, on Sept. 19 in Tokyo. 

The best action in Round 1 came after the finish line. There was jawing, the shove and, then, Lyles turning around, backpedaling, reaching his arms out and bouncing up and down like a boxer before lobbing a few more choice words at Bednarek. 

Their argument bled into the start of what is normally a celebratory NBC winner's interview.

“I tell ya, if you've got a problem, I expect a call,” Bednarek said, as the network's Lewis Johnson moved the mic between the runners.

Lyles replied: “You know what, you're right. You're right. Let's talk after this.”

Though they shook hands during that tense post-race, Bednarek was fired up well after the sprinters had left the track.




“The summary is, don't do that to me,” he said. “I don't do any of that stuff. It's not good character right there. That's pretty much it. At the end of the day, he won the race. I've got to give him props. He was the better man today.”

The win itself was no big surprise for Lyles, the three-time defending world champion who will have to get past Bednarek to make it four in Tokyo. Bednarek was asked what Lyles said as he turned around and gloated after securing his fifth national title at his favorite distance.

“What he said didn't matter, it's just what he did,” Bednarek said. “Unsportsmanlike (expletive) and I don't deal with that. It's a respect factor. He's fresh. Last time we lined it up, I beat him, that's all I can say. Next time we line up, I'm going to win. That's all that matters.”

Asked to expand on his role in the tiff, Lyles was less forthcoming: “On coach's orders, no comment.”

As is common in a year after the Olympics — and in an era after Usain Bolt — track is a sport desperately in need of some energy. Who else to provide it than Lyles, the sport's most engaging character this side of Sha'Carri Richardson, who found herself in off-the-track headlines again this weekend. 

Up to now, track media and the runners themselves have tried to generate rivalries between Lyles and Erriyon Knighton (fizzled), or Lyles and Letsile Tebogo (beat him in the Olympics last year) or, of course, between Lyles and NFL receiver Tyreek Hill (supposed grudge match never took place).

Turns out, they probably should have looked at the lane next to him. Bednarek has won silver and beaten Lyles the last two times they've lined up in the 200 at the Olympics, even though Lyles has had issues at both — in Tokyo with his mental health, then in Paris with COVID.

Bednarek referenced some long-simmering issues between the two. 

“Just some personal stuff we've got to handle,” he said. 

But when asked for something, anything, about this burgeoning rivalry, Lyles demurred, instead focusing on what a difficult year this has been for him after an injury in April kept him out of spikes until June. 

“If they ain't gonna beat me now, they ain't gonna beat me ever,” Lyles said. 

Bednarek isn't so sure of that. 

The 200 final was Bednarek's fifth race of the week, counting the three heats of the 100 meters, where he won the final Friday. Lyles, who has an automatic spot at worlds in that event as the defending champion, only ran one heat of the 100. 

“We'll go fresh and we'll see what happens,” Bednarek said. “Because I'm very confident I can beat him. That's all I can say.”

It was a winning weekend for Jefferson-Wooden, who also captured the 100 on Friday. She will be joined in the 100 at worlds by Richardson, who has an automatic spot as the defending champion. Richardson didn't advance to the final in the 200.

The women's 400 hurdles was wide open with Olympic champion and world-record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone electing to focus on the open 400 ( she won the event Saturday ). Dalilah Muhammad, 35, took control and cruised to the win.

One of the afternoon's most exciting finishes was in the men's 800 meters, where 2019 world champion Donavan Brazier used a strong kick to hold off 16-year-old Cooper Lutkenhaus and Bryce Hoppel.

In the 5,000 meters, Shelby Houlihan held off Elise Cranny by less than a second to win the title. Houlihan returned to track this year after serving a four-year doping ban. The former U.S. record holder in the 5,000 tested positive after eating a burrito she claimed was tainted with a performance-enhancing drug.

White House senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro discusses whether he believes President Donald Trump's tariffs policies will hold up in court on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

After an exhaustive investigation by the Department of Commerce under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, President Trump is imposing significant tariffs on imported copper. This critical material is as essential now to America's economic and national security as oil, electricity, and semiconductors.  

Indeed, in an era defined by artificial intelligence, grid modernization, and advanced computing, copper has become indispensable for technological innovation and defense. Our military systems—from aircraft and submarines to advanced weaponry—rely heavily on copper, as do essential civilian sectors, including the electrical grid, telecommunications networks, and cutting-edge manufacturing.  

Despite copper's strategic importance, America's copper industry continues to be hollowed out by unfair foreign trade practices—including state-subsidized overcapacity and below-cost dumping by countries like China, Vietnam, and India to export manipulation and predatory pricing by countries like Chile, Peru, and Mexico. These practices, often violating WTO rules, depress global copper prices and discourage investment in domestic smelting and refining facilities. Combined with burdensome domestic regulations, this has left America dangerously reliant on foreign sources for a metal critical to our defense and economic security. 

MORNING GLORY: PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE UNITED STATES' MASSIVE TARIFF HAUL IN HIS FIRST SIX MONTHS BACK

Once a global leader in copper mining, refining, and manufacturing, the U.S. now faces a perilous dependence on imports. Our refining capacity alone has declined by 56 percent since the late 1990s, forcing us into the absurd position of exporting raw copper ore and scrap overseas, only to re-import finished products. This isn't merely inefficient—it's strategically reckless.  

The trade deficit in copper-intensive downstream products underscores our vulnerability. Between 2010 and 2024, this deficit surged from $4.8 billion to a staggering $19.4 billion, a 302 percent increase. Last year alone, America imported nearly a million metric tons of refined copper to meet basic domestic needs. Every pound of copper imported is a pound we could and should be processing right here at home, creating American jobs and securing our supply chains.  

This troubling dependence is compounded by global overcapacity in copper refining, predominantly fueled by state-subsidized overproduction abroad. The result? America has become dangerously reliant on foreign sources for a metal integral to our defense and economic security.  

To address this threat, President Trump, acting decisively under Section 232 authority, has imposed tariffs designed to rebuild and safeguard America's copper supply chains. Specifically, the President is implementing an immediate 50 percent tariff on imported semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products. Additionally, refined copper imports will face a phased tariff—starting at 15 percent in 2027 and increasing to 30 percent in 2028. These measured steps will provide critical breathing room for U.S. companies to ramp up domestic refining and processing capabilities.  

Trump Tariff ""panicans"" will inevitably complain about costs and economic disruption. But let's be clear: these tariffs represent a modest and necessary premium compared to the enormous risks posed by continued dependence on foreign copper.  

We've learned from prior Section 232 actions on steel and aluminum that tariffs can successfully revitalize critical industries. Those actions attracted billions of dollars in new investment, restored domestic capacity, created thousands of jobs, and secured crucial materials for our military and infrastructure.  

The tariffs on copper will yield similar results. They will catalyze the revival of domestic refining and smelting capabilities, incentivize investment in new technologies, and put Americans back to work in states across our great land producing the copper we desperately need. 

The United States holds abundant copper reserves—enough to fully meet domestic demand for approximately 40 years. Arizona alone hosts some of the country's largest deposits, including the Morenci mine, one of North America's most productive copper sources. 

Revitalizing America's copper industry means revitalizing American communities. From copper mines in Arizona and Montana to smelters and processing plants in Utah, Texas, and Indiana, these tariffs will help create thousands of high-paying, blue-collar jobs. Investments will flow into exploration, refining, and downstream manufacturing—boosting local economies and rebuilding the industrial heartland. This is economic nationalism for national security's sake.

In an era defined by strategic competition and supply chain vulnerabilities, we cannot afford passive reliance on foreign producers who harm our country with their massive exports. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the critical risks of relying on foreign supply chains, underscoring the need to strengthen domestic production capabilities for strategic materials like copper.  

These new Trump copper tariffs will help reduce America's persistent trade deficit and safeguard our economy against dangerous supply interruptions during geopolitical tensions or future global crises. Domestic production of critical materials like copper is not just sound economics; it's imperative to maintain our sovereignty and security.

America's copper industry—and the American workers who sustain it—have waited far too long for decisive action. By invoking Section 232, President Trump is taking exactly that kind of decisive, bold action to put American security first. 

President Trump's message is clear: the United States will no longer tolerate economic policies that hollow out our industries and jeopardize national security. With these copper tariffs, we're taking a critical step to protect our economy, rebuild our industry, and ensure our national security.

Fox News contributor Joe Concha discusses former Vice President Kamala Harris' new book on her brief presidential campaign.

When former Vice President Kamala Harris announced that she would not be running for California governor, she appeared to leave the door open to another shot at the White House in 2028. 

However, the real Democratic contender to watch is not Harris.  

Rather – implausible as it may seem to some – New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appears to be the front-runner for Democrats' 2028 presidential nomination, should she forgo a Senate campaign, which she would almost certainly win. 

‘NO ONE' EXCITED ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS' POTENTIAL GUBERNATORIAL RUN, SAY CALIFORNIA DONORS

Put another way, right now, Kamala Harris will likely not be president in 2028, but AOC could very well be the Democratic nominee, with a shot at the White House.

I say this for multiple reasons. 

First, it could be argued that AOC is even stronger than other presidential candidates at this moment in their careers or respective races. 

CALIFORNIA DEM DOUBTS SOMEONE FROM THEIR STATE COULD WIN PRESIDENCY SINCE THEY'RE THOUGHT OF AS 'CRAZY PEOPLE'

At this point in the 2008 election cycle – coinciding with the summer of 2005 – Barack Obama was not even considered enough of a serious candidate to be included in polls. 

Likewise, in the 2020 primary – which Harris was forced to withdraw from before a single vote was even cast – Harris' highwater mark in polling two years out was 7% in an Axios poll.  

That was good for 5th place, trailing former President Biden by 15-points, and even Oprah Winfrey by 9-points. 

Conversely, Ocasio-Cortez is already a top finisher in 2028 Democratic primary polls. 

21 DEMOCRATS WHO MAY TRY TO SUCCEED TRUMP IN THE 2028 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

Per Race to the White House polling aggregator, AOC (10%) ranks 3rd, behind former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Gov. Gavin Newsom (13% each) – a virtual tie – when Harris is not included.  

And when polls with Harris are included, the former VP (21%) is well below even a 30% barrier, having seen her support drop 14-points since January, whereas AOC's has risen by 9-points.

Still, in individual polls where Harris and AOC are tested together, AOC held a four-point lead over the former VP (19% to 15%), according to AtlasIntel polling. 

Similarly, political betting sites such as Polymarket show Ocasio-Cortez with the 2nd best odds, trailing Newsom by just four points (20% to 16%). Harris is in 5th with just 6%. 

LESS THAN 4 MONTHS INTO TRUMP'S 2ND TERM, DEMS ARE ALREADY EYEING THE 2028 RACE

Additionally, AOC's favorability (46%) ranks higher than President Trump (44%), as well as Vice President JD Vance and former Vice President Kamala Harris (42% each), per AtlasIntel. 

There also may be reason to believe that AOC could do as well in a general election as Newsom or Buttigieg. 

In a series of hypothetical 2028 matchups pitting Vance against top Democrats, Vance's three-point lead over AOC (44% to 41%) is virtually identical to his lead over Newsom (45% to 42%) and over Pete Buttigieg (44% to 43%), per Emerson. 

Notably, Harris was not even tested in the Emerson poll. 

AOC'S CONSTITUENTS WEIGH IN ON PRESIDENTIAL RUN, RECALL HER STUNNING 2018 POLITICAL UPSET

Behind Ocasio-Cortez's strong polling numbers are her dominant fundraising and convening abilities, especially her ability to generate enthusiasm. 

Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported that AOC raised more than $15 million in 2025 – almost double Speaker Mike Johnson, with 99% coming from small dollar donors.

To Harris' credit, the former VP raised a historic amount of money during the 2024 campaign, but having failed at generating enthusiasm, donor fatigue is already evident. 

Even prior to Harris' recent announcement, reports had mentioned the ""lack of enthusiasm"" among big donors for a second presidential bid – an ominous sign before a candidacy is even announced. 

CROCKETT CRITICIZES AOC AND BERNIE SANDERS' 'FIGHTING OLIGARCHY' TOUR FOR MAKING IT ABOUT THEMSELVES

On the other hand, Ocasio-Cortez is currently among the strongest – if not the strongest –drawer of crowds of any Democrat, reflecting her ability to generate levels of enthusiasm Harris simply could not. 

AOC's nationwide rallies with fellow progressive Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, have drawn tens of thousands of voters, including more than 30,000 in Los Angeles and Denver.  

Per Race to the White House polling aggregator, AOC (10%) ranks 3rd, behind former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Gov. Gavin Newsom (13% each) – a virtual tie – when Harris is not included.  

Moreover, AOC has drawn considerably larger crowds even in traditionally Republican areas. In Idaho and Montana, 12,500 and 9,000 people, respectively, filled stadiums to hear the New York representative. 

AOC is also drawing these crowds in a year when there are no elections, an impressive feat. 

AOC BROKE HOUSE RULES TO ATTEND RITZY MET GALA IN 'TAX THE RICH' DRESS, ORDERED TO PAY UP

To be sure, there are legitimate doubts as to whether or not Ocasio-Cortez would be a viable candidate. She will turn 39 years old just weeks before the 2028 election, and her far-left ideology may be less attractive in a general election. 

And yet, in terms of winning a Democratic primary, history and current polling suggest that AOC may well be a formidable candidate for whichever position she chooses. 

Candidates without high national profiles have frequently emerged from Democratic primaries, including George McGovern, as well as former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. 

Further, concerns that AOC is too far to the political left may actually help her in a primary where the electorate tends to be dominated by the left. Not to mention that a considerable number of moderate Democrats will likely rally around the eventual nominee, regardless of who wins.

On the contrary, Harris struggled with voters both on the left and in the middle and has shown no reason to believe a 2028 run would address those problems. 

One way for AOC to mitigate age and electability concerns would be to challenge Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the upcoming midterms, a race AOC would likely win. 

To Harris' credit, the former VP raised a historic amount of money during the 2024 campaign, but having failed at generating enthusiasm, donor fatigue is already evident. 

A poll conducted earlier this spring showed AOC leading Schumer by almost 20-points (55% to 36%), and Democrats would likely be encouraged by the idea of having a younger candidate than the 74-year-old incumbent.

Ultimately, whether or not Ocasio-Cortez can sustain this momentum remains to be seen. 

Nevertheless, right now, the path to the Democratic presidential nomination is significantly more open to AOC than other candidates, particularly Kamala Harris.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., blasted his fellow Democrats for being ""complicit"" with President Donald Trump's actions during a testy objection to a package of new police legislation voted on by the Senate earlier today.

Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., responded to Sen. Corey Booker's, D-N.J., outburst on the Senate floor last week in an interview with The New York Times.

Cortez Masto was asked by the New York Times to respond to Booker's accusations against Democrats that they were ""complicit"" with President Donald Trump's agenda.

""I don't need lectures from anyone on how to push back and fight this administration. I've been doing it since I got to the Senate, because I won my Senate race in 2016 and Donald Trump won at the same time. I'm also from a swing state; I've still got to get stuff done on behalf of my state,"" Masto told The New York Times.

MSNBC DEMOCRATS MOCK CORY BOOKER'S 'POLITICAL THEATER' STUNT ON THE SENATE FLOOR

Booker accused his fellow Democratic senators last week of aligning themselves with Trump because they are in favor of passing new police legislation. He claimed that without amendments, the legislation would allow the president to pick winners and losers in terms of who receives the benefits.

""That is complicity with an authoritarian leader who is trashing our country,"" Booker said. ""It is time for Democrats to have a backbone. It's time for us to fight. It's time for us to draw a line, and when it comes to the safety of my state being denied these grants, that's why I'm standing here.""

‘PROFOUND COWARDICE': BOOKER SLAMS WALTZ FOR ‘FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP,' SIGNALGATE ACCOUNTABILITY

Booker's objection stemmed from a call from Democrats to pass a package of law enforcement-related bills aimed at boosting resources for police, including shoring up death benefits for officers lost in the line of duty, providing greater mental health support for officers, and addressing child exploitation.

The bills, which eventually passed, were discussed and approved in committee before reaching the Senate floor.

Masto thought the legislation would benefit everyone across the country.

""Why would you throw out good legislation that's going to benefit everyone across the country? That doesn't make sense. We still have to have a functioning government. That's part of gaining the trust of Americans again, so they understand there are people that are working on their behalf,"" Masto said. ""But most importantly, we have to win. Winning means we've got to win these swing states, and focus on those swing voters and what matters to them and talk to them and that we're addressing the issues they care about.""

DON'T BE DISTRACTED — FOCUS ON WHAT HILLARY CLINTON DID. There's a house-of-mirrors quality to the newly-declassified annex from special counsel John Durham's investigation of the investigation in the Trump-Russia matter. What is true? What is genuine? What does it mean?

There's a simpler way to read it: Just focus on what we know the Hillary Clinton campaign actually did in the 2016 presidential campaign against Donald Trump. Leave speculation and judgments of motive out of it. 

The best way to do that is to start not with the Durham annex but with the actual Durham report, which was released in 2023. In it, Durham discussed what he called the “Clinton Plan intelligence,” that is, his discovery that U.S. intelligence learned about what Russian intelligence learned — yes, it's complicated — about an alleged Clinton campaign plan to accuse Donald Trump of collusion with Russia.

This is perhaps the most important paragraph in Durham's 306-page report. It's worth reading carefully:

The Clinton Plan intelligence itself and on its face arguably suggested that private actors affiliated with the Clinton campaign were seeking in 2016 to promote a false or exaggerated narrative to the public and to U.S. government agencies about Trump's possible ties to Russia. Given the significant quantity of materials the FBI and other government agencies did in fact receive during the 2016 presidential election season and afterwards that originated with and/or were funded by the Clinton campaign or affiliated persons (i.e., the Steele Dossier reports, the Alfa Bank allegations, and the YotaPhone allegations), the Clinton Plan intelligence prompted the [special counsel's] office to consider (i) whether there was in fact a plan by the Clinton campaign to tie Trump to Russia in order to “stir up a scandal” in advance of the 2016 presidential election, and (ii) if such a plan existed, whether an aspect or component of that plan was to intentionally provide knowingly false and/or misleading information to the FBI or other agencies in furtherance of such a plan.

This is what we know, as outlined in the Durham report. On April 1, the Democratic/Clinton law firm Perkins Coie hired Fusion GPS, an opposition research term, which in turn hired former British spy Christopher Steele to investigate allegations of Trump ties to Russia. Steele was also a CHS, or confidential human source, for the FBI, going back several years. 

On June 14, 2016, there were media reports the Russians had hacked the Democratic National Committee. On July 22, the Friday before the Democratic National Convention was scheduled to begin on Monday, stolen DNC emails were published in the press, causing embarrassment to the Democratic Party. (The emails showed clearly that Clinton and the party had worked to undermine rival Bernie Sanders.)

On July 24, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook took to the Sunday shows to claim that Russia was behind the DNC hack — a lot of people were saying that — and further, that “experts” were saying “this was done by the Russians for the purpose of helping Donald Trump.”

Mook had no evidence to support his charge. “It was a remarkable moment,” the New York Times reported the same day, July 24. “Even at the height of the Cold War, it was hard to find a presidential campaign willing to charge that its rival was essentially secretly doing the bidding of a key American adversary. But the accusation is emerging as a theme of Mrs. Clinton's campaign….” With that, the effort to smear Trump as a “Russian asset” was off and running.

But smearing your opponent is part of politics, however unsavory. What if what Clinton did was just opposition research? “Steele was hired by Fusion GPS to essentially conduct opposition research against then-candidate Trump in the midst of a U.S. presidential election,” the Durham report notes. “While many may find this practice unseemly, political opposition research is a firmly entrenched feature of U.S. electoral politics.”

On the other hand, what if the Clinton team went beyond oppo research? That is what Durham was getting at when he wanted to know if Clinton's plan was to “intentionally provide knowingly false and/or misleading information to the FBI or other agencies.” That's more than just opposition research.

The answer is in the Durham report, with new details provided by the Durham annex. Among those new details is that the FBI received from a secret source a Russian communication from early March saying that Clinton's staff was “preparing scandalous revelations of business relations between Trump and the ‘Russian Mafia.'” That certainly lines up with the campaign's hiring of Christopher Steele and the plan to tie Trump to Russia.

Then we learn, from another Russian communication provided by the secret source, that on July 26 — remember the leaked emails were made public on July 22 and Mook made his accusation on July 24 — Clinton “approved a plan proposed by one of her foreign policy advisers … to ‘smear Donald Trump by magnifying the scandal tied to the intrusion by the Russian special services in the pre-election process to benefit the Republican candidate.'”

Democrats and their allies in the media immediately pronounced that information fake. Durham's investigators, experienced prosecutors, felt otherwise. But leave that question unsettled. Focus instead on what we know, from the Durham report, and now from the Durham annex, about what Clinton actually did. Consider five data points:

1) By April, 2016, the Clinton campaign already had a contractor — Steele — working on developing damaging information on Trump and Russia.

2) By July 24, the campaign was publicly raising the charge of Trump-Russia collusion, and the New York Times reported the topic was “emerging as a theme of Mrs. Clinton's campaign.”

3) Also in July, Steele contacted an FBI agent and “requested an urgent meeting,” according to the Durham report. There Steele gave the FBI one of his first reports. It alleged, famously, that “Russian authorities had been cultivating and supporting US Republican president candidate Donald Trump for at least five years,” an operation that was “both supported and directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.” It also alleged, infamously, that Russian spy cameras had recorded “Trump's (perverted) conduct in Moscow” including “employing a number of prostitutes to perform a ‘golden showers' (urination) show in front of him.” That was the salacious and wildly false allegation that later became known as the “pee tape.” It is without any doubt an example of the Clinton campaign, working through its contractor Steele, providing “false and/or misleading information to the FBI or other agencies.”

4) After July, Steele worked hard to funnel his anti-Trump material into the media. For journalists, the dossier's unsupported gossip would be legitimized by the fact that the FBI was investigating it.

5) In September, a Democratic lawyer working on behalf of the Clinton campaign, Michael Sussmann, planted a false allegation about Trump and Russia — the so-called Alfa Bank story — with the FBI. At the time, Sussmann denied he was acting for the Clinton team, even though he billed the campaign for the outreach to the FBI.

In light of that, look at Durham's two questions: “(i) whether there was in fact a plan by the Clinton campaign to tie Trump to Russia in order to ‘stir up a scandal' in advance of the 2016 presidential election, and (ii) if such a plan existed, whether an aspect or component of that plan was to intentionally provide knowingly false and/or misleading information to the FBI or other agencies in furtherance of such a plan.”

The answer to (i) is yes, there was a plan. The answer to (ii)? Well, there is no question that the Clinton campaign provided false and/or misleading information to the FBI. Whether it did so knowing the information was false and/or misleading is still a point of argument, at least among Democrats. In light of the entirety of what is now known, it seems extremely hard to believe the campaign did not know its feeds to the FBI were false and/or misleading.

Still, in the most basic sense, we know what Hillary Clinton did. It wasn't just opposition research. She and her campaign team accused Trump of collusion and then fed false and/or misleading information relating to that accusation to the FBI, after which it became the subject of alarmist reporting in the press. In the short run, it didn't work — Clinton lost and Trump won. But in the long run, it upended American politics for years, and no one is the better for it.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","A bipartisan permitting reform breakthrough","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3488783/bipartisan-permitting-reform-breakthrough/","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

The Supreme Court limited its scope last month. President Donald Trump changed how federal agencies enforce it during his first month in office. Republicans tried to rewrite it in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but were thwarted by the parliamentarian. Now, permitting reformers are back, this time with a bipartisan House bill that would provide much-needed regulatory relief from the National Environmental Policy Act to virtually every sector of the economy.

House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) introduced the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act last month, legislation that in Westerman's words would “launch America into a future where we can effectively innovate and implement to revitalize our infrastructure, meet skyrocketing energy demands, lead the world in the [artificial intelligence] race and work in harmony with our natural environment.”

As Golden stresses in his statement on the bill, and the Supreme Court reinforced in its recent decision on the law, NEPA is a “procedural statute.” Unlike the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, NEPA doesn't actually make the environment better in any measurable way. It doesn't remove bacteria from our water or particulates from the air. All it does is create a series of hoops federal agencies must jump through whenever anything they do touches the environment. 

If the Interior Department wants to issue a grazing permit for a rancher, it must comply with NEPA. If the Forest Service wants to do a controlled burn to prevent forest fires, it must comply with NEPA. If the Energy Department provides a loan guarantee for a power line, it must comply with NEPA.

In theory, the hoops NEPA requires federal agencies to jump through sound fine. It requires agencies to study how their actions affect the environment. These studies are called Environmental Impact Statements. Federal agencies studying the environmental effects of their actions sounds good. But NEPA goes further than that by empowering entities to sue in federal court if the scope of a review is too large, or too small, or if all the Ts weren't crossed and all the Is weren't dotted. 

This citizen suit provision has become a boon to environmental activists and their nonprofit organizations that raise money by bragging to donors about all the infrastructure projects they have prevented. While these litigants lose more than 80% of the time, their suits cost money to defend, cause years of delay, and often end with a project's cancellation, even though the project caused no underlying environmental harm.

The SPEED Act tackles this problem in a number of ways. First, it untriggers NEPA if the agency action is only financial. Loan guarantees or program grants no longer need to comply with NEPA. It also limits who can sue under NEPA to those who both participated in the public comment process, made a specific substantive claim, and can show direct harm to them from the agency action. This is a huge limitation compared to the old regime.

Most importantly, however, the SPEED Act allows projects to continue while the agency addresses NEPA noncompliance. No more project delays! Even if a plaintiff shows that an agency abused its discretion in the NEPA process, a project can continue while the agency rectifies the error.

THE END OF THE HOMELESS INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX

The SPEED Act would be a huge boost to the entire economy. Roads will be built faster and cheaper, as will factories, power plants, transmission lines, homes, apartments, ski resorts, shopping centers, and much more. Name anything that needs to be built, and thanks to SPEED, it will be built cheaper and faster.

Some in the Democratic Party are now styling themselves as part of an Abundance Movement. The SPEED Act is a test for these Democrats. Do they support real permitting reform to make America a country that builds again? Or will they side with environmental groups and push our country further down the path of decline and mediocrity? Hopefully, for the sake of young Americans hoping to start a family, Democrats choose growth, dynamism, and bipartisanship.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) asked to meet with their counterparts, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), to discuss government funding.

With government funding set to expire Sept. 30, the House and Senate are bracing for a shutdown. The Democratic leaders highlighted the effect on healthcare coverage if a solution isn't agreed to.

“As Leaders of the House and Senate, you have the responsibility to govern for all Americans and work on a bipartisan basis to avert a painful, unnecessary shutdown at the end of September,” Schumer and Jeffries wrote in the letter first obtained by Punchbowl News. “Yet it is clear that the Trump administration and many within your party are preparing to ‘go it alone' and continue to legislate on a solely Republican basis.”

“Therefore, we request you swiftly convene a so-called Four Corners meeting this week, for the four of us to discuss the government funding deadline and the health care crisis you have visited upon the American people,” the letter continued.

Schumer and Jeffries said they are willing to work with Republicans in a bipartisan manner, highlighting bipartisan support for funding for the Departments of Agriculture and Veterans Affairs.

President Donald Trump has not signed any of the annual funding bills for fiscal 2026 into law. Lawmakers in Congress expect to again pass a continuing resolution or stopgap to fund the government through the year.

Democratic lawmakers have told Republicans, who hold a narrow majority in both chambers, that if they agree to help them fund the government, they would not work to pass another rescissions bill, which recently defunded previously appropriated funds.

Schumer attempted to make a deal with Trump and Republicans to advance some of Trump's judicial nominations in exchange for restoring funding, but the deal fell through.

Texas lawmakers gathered in New York to blast Republicans' redistricting proposal after more than 50 Texas House Democrats fled the state ahead of a scheduled legislative session on Monday.

As the GOP seeks to redraw congressional maps and add as many as five congressional seats in their favor, state Democrats broke quorum, or the minimum number of legislators needed to conduct business, and traveled to Illinois, Boston, and Albany, New York.

In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) said during a press conference that the fleeing lawmakers are “brave soldiers for our democracy” and they are on the “right side of history.”

“History will judge us for how we respond to this moment,” Hochul said.

“This is a war. We are at war. And that's why the gloves are off, and I say, bring it on,” she added.

Texas state Rep. Mihaela Plesa, vice chairwoman of the state Democratic caucus, said at the press conference that this is a moment of “national urgency” and condemned Republicans for strategically tying the redistricting to financial relief for families who were affected by the devastating floods that killed over 120 people.

“Today on the House floor, House Republicans do not want to put flood relief, disaster relief — they didn't want to do anything for the people of Texas. They're bending the knee to President Donald Trump,” Plesa said.

She said the redistricting bill is an “attempt to steal power,” comparing Trump asking for redistricting in Texas to his plea with Georgia leadership to find votes during the 2020 election.

“What did Georgia say? No. Well, Trump called our governor. … What did our governor say? ‘Sure, give me a minute. Coming right up,'” Plesa said.

Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) is threatening to remove the lawmakers from office. The state lawmakers are also facing $500 fines and possible legal action from Texas GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton.

Hochul said the Texas Democrats would be leaving New York today, but advised the lawmakers not to say where they are heading next. Texas Democratic state Rep. James Talarico, who is with the delegation of state leaders in Illinois, told the Washington Examiner, “No, we're not going back today!”

Plesa said Texas Democrats are “building a coalition” and meeting with Democratic governors across the country.

“We're continuing to bring coalitions into the fold and educating people as to what's happening and letting them know that the rules have changed,” Plesa said.

Texas Democratic state Rep. Lulu Flores said the Democrats are not “abandoning our jobs,” as Republicans and Abbott have accused.

“I represent a Democratic district, and our voices deserve to be heard. I am not abandoning my duties — I am doing my job, and Democrats have been shut out of the process over and over and over again, and Democratic voices have a right to be represented,” Flores said.

In response to Texas's redistricting, blue states such as New York and California have begun exploring options to hold their own mid-decade redistricting to offset any additional GOP seats drawn by the Lone Star State.

Hochul said at the presser that she is exploring “every option” with state leaders to redraw New York's congressional lines “as soon as possible.”

New York Democrats unveiled a bill last week that would begin mid-decade redistricting in 2027, only if another state does it first. However, Hochul noted that kickstarting redistricting would require amending the state Constitution either this year or next year, with a likely implementation in the fall of 2027 ahead of the 2028 presidential election.

TEXAS DEMOCRATS LEAVE STATE IN EFFORT TO HALT GOP REDISTRICTING PLAN

New York Democratic Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie said there's “no such thing as nonpartisan in politics” when asked if the mindset of New York not playing fair because Texas isn't playing fair could lead to a “slippery slope.”

“I think it's difficult to ask New York, California, and other Democratic-leaning states to play non-partisan while the Republicans play very partisan,” Heastie said.

The idea of racial equity sounds nice, doesn't it? The Left certainly thinks so. In fact, it's taken the concept even further, pushing it to the point where racial equity has, in many cases, become racial favoritism. As the Left sees it, given America's history of minority oppression, prioritizing those groups over whites isn't just a good idea — it's essential.

As diversity, equity, and inclusion fever swept the country during the Biden years, some quietly complied to safeguard their careers. Others, such as the current leadership of Cincinnati, Ohio, embraced DEI not just as policy, but as a personal worldview. And, following the brutal assault of a white couple by a group of predominantly young black individuals in downtown Cincinnati last weekend, it's come back to haunt them.

Those who rely on liberal media outlets for their news may not have heard about this incident. Had the races been reversed, of course, footage of the attack would have dominated the airwaves in an endless loop within minutes. But we've grown accustomed to selective coverage from the legacy media.

More troubling was the way city officials handled it. It took Democratic Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval three days to address the incident. Worse, in his statement, Purevak referred to the savage beatings as a “fight.”

Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge waited until Monday to hold a press conference. After briefing reporters on the details of the case, she directed a sharp, accusatory glare toward the group gathered before her and said she wanted to cover another topic.

“Social media and journalism and the role it plays in this incident, and yes, guys, that's you. That is you,” Theetge said.

She continued, “Social media, the posts that we have seen, do not depict the entire incident. That is one version of what occurred. At times, social media and mainstream media and their commentaries are a misrepresentation of the circumstances surrounding any given event.”

“That causes us some difficulties in thoroughly investigating the activity and enforcing the law. Social media posts and your coverage of them distort the context of what actually happened, and that makes our job more difficult,” Theetge said.

One reporter asked the obvious question: “What was distorted?”

Theetge replied, “Yeah, so I think the irresponsibility with social media is it just shows one side of the equation quite frequently without context, without factual context. And then people run with that, and then it grows legs. And it becomes something bigger that we then have to try to manage as part of the investigation.”

Although she never specified which facts were distorted, Theetge turned to another reporter for the next question.

Rumors circulating on social media suggest that, prior to the attack, the male victim may have slapped a black man in the face. Is that what provoked a mob to brutally assault a white man and his female companion? And if so, does Theetge view that alleged provocation as justification for the brutal response that followed?

Well, we don't know. However, what is clear is that rather than showing concern for the victims, Theetge appears more focused on downplaying the terrible optics of a group of black youths beating a middle-aged white couple to a pulp.

Naturally, the public is interested in understanding what happened. We typically rely on local and national media, as well as local law enforcement, to provide us with accurate and timely information when incidents like this occur. But when those institutions fail to fulfill their responsibilities to keep us informed, particularly when the details of a case don't align with their preferred narratives, it's no surprise that people turn to social media to fill in the gaps.

Theetge should have saved her condemnation for the people responsible for this vile act.

As it turns out, this wasn't the first time her left-leaning positions have drawn criticism.

Just two months ago, Theetge made headlines when four veteran Cincinnati police officers filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city and Theetge, alleging systemic workplace discrimination. According to Newsweek, the officers said they were passed over for key assignments and promotions in favor of less qualified women and minority candidates. The lawsuit accuses the city and Theetge, personally and officially, of implementing intentionally discriminatory practices that unfairly target white males.

By far the most appalling comment came from Cincinnati City Council President Pro Tem Victoria Parks, who responded to a Facebook post, saying, “They begged for that beat down! I am grateful for the whole story.”

Given her prior advocacy for causes such as declaring racism a public health crisis, Parks's sentiments aren't surprising. However, what is startling is that a public official would be reckless enough to put them in writing.

This case lays bare just how deeply DEI ideology has embedded itself in progressive institutions — and the real-world consequences when its proponents hold influential positions in government and law enforcement.

ARKANSAS TEACHER CHARGED IN STABBING DEATHS OF FATHER AND MOTHER HIKING WITH THEIR CHILDREN

But now, as cultural and institutional backlash against this toxic ideology gains momentum, the costs of rigidly filtering every situation through a DEI lens are becoming impossible to ignore. The bloom is off the rose — and those who remain tethered to it may soon find themselves out of step with a public demanding transparency, fairness, and accountability over ideology-driven optics.

And yes, Theetge, that's you. That is you.

Children who were raised on screens need more freedom out in the real world.

One common explanation for why children spend so much of their free time on screens goes like this: Smartphones and social-media platforms are addicting them. Kids stare at their devices and socialize online instead of in person because that's what tech has trained them to want.

But this misses a key part of the story. The three of us collaborated with the Harris Poll to survey a group of Americans whose perspectives don't often show up in national data: children. What they told us offers a comprehensive picture of how American childhood is changing—and, more important, how to make it better.

In March, the Harris Poll surveyed more than 500 children ages 8 to 12 across the United States, who were assured that their answers would remain private. They offered unmistakable evidence that the phone-based childhood is in full force. A majority reported having smartphones, and about half of the 10-to-12-year-olds said that most or all of their friends use social media.

This digital technology has given kids access to virtual worlds, where they're allowed to roam far more freely than in the real one. About 75 percent of kids ages 9 to 12 regularly play the online game Roblox, where they can interact with friends and even strangers. But most of the children in our survey said that they aren't allowed to be out in public at all without an adult. Fewer than half of the 8- and 9-year-olds have gone down a grocery-store aisle alone; more than a quarter aren't allowed to play unsupervised even in their own front yard.

Jonathan Haidt: End the phone-based childhood now

Yet these are exactly the kinds of freedoms that kids told us they long for. We asked them to pick their favorite way to spend time with friends: unstructured play, such as shooting hoops and exploring their neighborhood; participating in activities organized by adults, such as playing Little League and doing ballet; or socializing online. There was a clear winner.

Children want to meet up in person, no screens or supervision. But because so many parents restrict their ability to socialize in the real world on their own, kids resort to the one thing that allows them to hang out with no adults hovering: their phones.

Since the 1980s, parents have grown more and more afraid that unsupervised time will expose their kids to physical or emotional harm. In another recent Harris Poll, we asked parents what they thought would happen if two 10-year-olds played in a local park without adults around. Sixty percent thought the children would likely get injured. Half thought they would likely get abducted.

These intuitions don't even begin to resemble reality. According to Warwick Cairns, the author of How to Live Dangerously, kidnapping in the United States is so rare that a child would have to be outside unsupervised for, on average, 750,000 years before being snatched by a stranger. Parents know their neighborhoods best, of course, and should assess them carefully. But the tendency to overestimate risk comes with its own danger. Without real-world freedom, children don't get the chance to develop competence, confidence, and the ability to solve everyday problems. Indeed, independence and unsupervised play are associated with positive mental-health outcomes.

Still, parents spend more time supervising their kids than parents did in the 1960s, even though they now work more and have fewer children. Across all income levels, families have come to believe that organized activities are the key to kids' safety and success. So sandlot games gave way to travel baseball. Cartwheels at the park gave way to competitive cheer teams. Kids have been strapped into the back seat of their lives—dropped off, picked up, and overhelped. As their independence has dwindled, their anxiety and depression have spiked. And they aren't the only ones suffering. In 2023, the surgeon general cited intensive caregiving as one reason today's parents are more stressed than ever.

From the February 2025 Issue: The anti-social century

Kids will always have more spare hours than adults can supervise—a gap that devices now fill. “Go outside” has been quietly replaced with “Go online.” The internet is one of the only escape hatches from childhoods grown anxious, small, and sad. We certainly don't blame parents for this. The social norms, communities, infrastructure, and institutions that once facilitated free play have eroded. Telling children to go outside doesn't work so well when no one else's kids are there.

That's why we're so glad that groups around the country are experimenting with ways to rebuild American childhood, rooting it in freedom, responsibility, and friendship. In Piedmont, California, a network of parents started dropping their kids off at the park every Friday to play unsupervised. Sometimes the kids argue or get bored—which is good. Learning to handle boredom and conflict is an essential part of child development. Elsewhere, churches, libraries, and schools are creating screen-free “play clubs.” To ease the transition away from screens and supervision, the Outside Play Lab at the University of British Columbia developed a free online tool that helps parents figure out how to give their kids more outdoor time, and why they should.

More than a thousand schools nationwide have begun using a free program from Let Grow, a nonprofit that two of us—Lenore and Jon—helped found to foster children's independence. K–12 students in the program get a monthly homework assignment: Do something new on your own, with your parents' permission but without their help. Kids use the prompt to run errands, climb trees, cook meals. Some finally learn how to tie their own shoes. Here's what one fourth grader with intellectual disabilities wrote—in her own words and spelling:

This is my fist let it gow project. I went shoping by myself. I handle it wheel but the ceckout was a lit hard but it was fun to do. I leand that I am brave and can go shop by myself. I loved my porject.

Other hopeful signs are emerging. The New Jersey–based Balance Project is helping 50 communities reduce screen time and restore free play for kids, employing the “four new norms” that Jon lays out in The Anxious Generation. This summer, Newburyport, Massachusetts, is handing out prizes each week to kids who try something new on their own. (Let Grow has a tool kit for other communities that want to do the same.) The Boy Scouts—now rebranded as Scouting America, and open to all young people—is finally growing again. We could go on.

What we see in the data and from the stories parents send us is both simple and poignant: Kids being raised on screens long for real freedom. It's like they're homesick for a world they've never known.

Granting them more freedom may feel uncomfortable at first. But if parents want their kids to put down their phones, they need to open the front door. Nearly three-quarters of the children in our survey agreed with the statement “I would spend less time online if there were more friends in my neighborhood to play with in person.”

Stephanie H. Murray: What adults lost when kids stopped playing in the street

If nothing changes, Silicon Valley will keep supplying kids with ever more sophisticated AI “friends” that are always available and will cater to a child's every whim. But AI will never fulfill children's deepest desires. Even this generation of digital natives still longs for what most of their parents had: time with friends, in person, without adults.

An already insular Defense Department is sealing itself off from outside thinkers.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Last month, a group of seven U.S. generals and admirals—including the top admiral in charge of U.S. military operations in the Asia-Pacific region—prepared to travel to the Aspen Security Forum, in Colorado. Security officials had spoken at the annual conference for years, including during Donald Trump's first term, and were set to discuss topics such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, the future of AI, and threats from China. But a day before the forum began, the officers' staff got calls from the Pentagon telling them to stay away. On social media, Sean Parnell, the Defense Department's top spokesperson, later made clear why: The forum, he said, was “hosted by an organization that promotes the evils of globalism, disdain for America, and hatred for our great president, Donald J. Trump.”

Aspen, it turned out, was only the beginning. Within days, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had ordered the DOD to vet all future event attendance by any defense official. In a statement to Politico, Parnell declared that the move was meant to “ensure the Department of Defense is not lending its name and credibility to organizations, forums, and events that run counter to the values of this administration.” (The Aspen Institute, which sponsors the security forum, describes itself as nonpartisan.)

Parnell's characterization of the new policy was vague, but it represented an abrupt departure from long-established DOD practices, and an important shift in the way that the military engages with the outside world: A Pentagon that has already grown more insular under Hegseth could end up cutting itself off from thinkers and ideas beyond the building, or at least those with which the administration disagrees.

Tom Nichols: The Pentagon against the think tanks

Military personnel and conference planners I spoke with described the decision as the latest battle in a broader war on ideas at the Pentagon under Hegseth. Earlier this year, the DOD eliminated the Office of Net Assessment, which had been created in the 1970s as a hub for strategic analysts to produce internal assessments of U.S. readiness against potential foes. Hegseth, who himself keeps a small group of advisers, was behind both decisions, defense officials told me.

Troops and civilians attend hundreds of events annually on behalf of the Pentagon, and have been doing so for decades. Whether gatherings on heady topics such as economic warfare and “gray zone” tactics or highly technical symposia about combatting rust on ships and the future of drone warfare, these events keep the military plugged into ideas from scholars and industry. Particularly since the Iraq War, the military has said that it wants to seek out ways to challenge its assumptions and solicit outside views—to make officers think through their plans and strategies and the second- and third-order effects of their decisions. Conferences are some of the main venues for this kind of exchange, though not the only ones; officers from dozens of other nations sit alongside American counterparts at U.S. war colleges, for example.

Previous administrations have required military personnel to secure approval to attend conferences. The difference, this time, is the apparently partisan slant to the vetting process. By prohibiting DOD personnel from engaging with viewpoints that the administration disagrees with, defense officials and conference planners told me, the Pentagon risks groupthink that could have real consequences.

Pete Mansoor, a retired Army colonel who served as executive officer to General David Petraeus during the 2007 surge in Iraq, told me he believes that Hegseth's emphasis on “lethality” over the kind of strategic thinking often fostered at conferences and think tanks could prove dangerous. “The fact that officers stopped thinking strategically and only thought about lethality resulted in a war that was almost lost in Iraq,” Mansoor, now a senior faculty fellow at Ohio State University's Mershon Center for International Security Studies, said. “I'm sure the Russian army also stresses lethality,” he continued, “but they have educated their generals on the basis of a million casualties” in Ukraine.

If the department continues to ban conference attendance in a substantial way, it will also make U.S. forces more like their Russian and Chinese counterparts, which in many cases can seek outside views only through state-sanctioned academics. “When did our ideas become so fragile that they can't stand up to someone who has alternate views?” one defense official asked me. (The official requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about this issue.)

The Defense Department review of conference attendance is having an immediate impact. Only after the policy was announced did Pentagon officials realize how many conferences military personnel attend, leading to a scramble to draft formal guidance across the force, defense officials told me. A DOD spokesperson was unable to tell me when such guidance will be released, and responded to a request for comment by pointing me to Parnell's statement about the review. In the meantime, military personnel are preemptively canceling their attendance at conferences. Some inside the Pentagon have even canceled internal meetings, fearful of running afoul of the new ban on “events” and “forums” not approved beforehand. National-security experts at think tanks, which often host security conferences, told me they are now unsure how much they can engage with American service members and the civilians working alongside them.

Also unclear is whether the policy applies to industry-related conferences, some of which are sponsored by private companies that spend millions of dollars to host them. Adding to the confusion, it was not initially clear whether the policy applied to one of the services, the Coast Guard, which falls under the Department of Homeland Security, not the DOD; a Coast Guard spokesperson told me that the service is working to align its policy with current DOD guidance.

Some military leaders dislike attending conferences and think-tank events, of course. Appearing in public forums can mean facing political questions and potentially giving a career-ending answer. Moreover, some leaders argue, think tanks are not always the best source of new ideas, particularly given that so many of their staff members once worked in government themselves. To tackle national-security threats, generals and admirals should be focused on warfare, not speaking to those who have never been on the front lines, the argument goes.

But the U.S. military has had a symbiotic relationship with think tanks for years. While government employees and military officers are mired in day-to-day operations and focused on tactical warfare, outside scholars have the time and space for engaging in strategic thinking and coming up with solutions to thorny problems. Some think tanks have created positions for serving officers, and the Pentagon has also created internal positions for think tankers, in part to facilitate an exchange of ideas. “So often in government, you are choosing between awful options. You think you have found the least-bad options, and places like think tanks allow you to test that conclusion,” Mara Karlin, a former U.S. assistant secretary of defense for strategy, plans, and capabilities, told me.

Several real policy changes have emerged from that arrangement. Scholars at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank, produced a proposal that served as a blueprint for the 2007 surge in Iraq, at a time when the security situation in the country was deteriorating. A 2022 Center for Strategic and International Studies war-game exercise found that, in a hypothetical situation in which China invaded Taiwan, the United States would be in grave jeopardy in a matter of weeks—the Chinese could successfully sink an aircraft carrier, attack U.S. bases in the region, and bring down American fighter jets. The exercise spurred Pentagon officials to reassess the military planning for a potential conflict in the region.

American officials have also made important statements and announcements at security-focused conferences. In the days before Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, then–Vice President Kamala Harris appeared at the Munich Security Conference to outline U.S. fears of imminent war. Earlier this year, Vice President J. D. Vance also attended the Munich Security Conference, where he blasted American allies and cast doubt on the idea that the United States would remain Europe's security guarantor. This year, Hegseth himself appeared at the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Shangri-La Dialogue, in Singapore, where he outlined U.S. strategy to combat threats from China. (Breaking with long-standing military norms of nonpartisanship, Hegseth also spoke to young conservatives at Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit last month.)

Later this year, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library & Museum will host a major national-security conference that usually draws Cabinet secretaries, industry leaders, and America's top generals and admirals. Several past defense secretaries have delivered the keynote speech. A phrase often invoked at the conference is peace through strength, which Reagan introduced into the modern lexicon during the 1980 presidential election, and which became a mantra of his administration's defense policy. It has also become one of Hegseth's favorite phrases for describing the military under Trump. And yet, by Hegseth's own directive, no one knows whether he or the troops he urges to embrace that approach will be able to attend the conference that celebrates it.

The border between childhood and adulthood keeps getting fuzzier and fuzzier.

A furry fiend with rabbit ears and a maniacal grin has recently been spotted twerking next to the singer Lizzo, baring its teeth on the former soccer star David Beckham's Instagram, and flopping against a woman's Chanel bag while wearing its own Tic Tac–size Chanel bag. The creature in question is Labubu—a soft-bellied plushie that the Chinese company Pop Mart began distributing in 2019, and that has, in the past year, gained hordes of admirers. In 2024, Pop Mart reported a more than 700 percent increase in the stuffie's sales. People have been doling out anywhere from about $30 to $150,000 a toy. At Brooklyn raves, adults hop around under neon lights with Labubus clipped to their belt loops. The devotion, at times, has turned almost ferocious; Pop Mart decided to suspend in-person sales of Labubu in the United Kingdom after reports of chaos at stores.

Commentators have offered all sorts of theories as to why Labubu has become a sensation. One factor might be scarcity: Each new Labubu release on Pop Mart's online store tends to sell out in minutes. Another might be surprise: The plushie arrives in a blind box. (It could be pink or gray; wear overalls or hold a Coke.) Some people have suggested that the Labubu hype is a product of a trickle-down celebrity effect, or that the toy has become a gay icon.

But the way I see it, the cult of Labubu is simply an extension of the phenomenon known as “kidulthood,” in which the boundary between childhood and adulthood keeps growing fuzzier and fuzzier. In the past few years, more American adults have been buying stuffed animals—some, researchers have told me, in an effort to reject staid versions of adulthood and inject more play into grown-up life. These adults have usually kept their plushies at home, relegating them to bookshelves and beds. Labubus, though, are “public displays of cuteness,” Erica Kanesaka, an Emory University professor and cute-studies scholar, told me in an email. Devotees carry Labubu into subway cars, office cubicles, and dental schools. They clock into shifts at KFC with the toy literally attached to their hip, and take it along for their workdays as football players or airline pilots.

Adults in other countries—Japan, perhaps most notably—have long worn objects featuring cute characters, such as Hello Kitty, out and about, hooked to bags and key chains. In the 1990s, it wasn't uncommon to see white-collar Japanese salarymen with Hello Kitty accessories dangling from their phones. The trend, Simon May, a philosopher and the author of The Power of Cute, told me, might have been born of a postwar rejection of overt aggression: After World War II, cute aesthetics were one way that Japan revamped its public-facing image. The country, May said, changed its self-presentation “180 degrees from militarism to pacifism.” But in the United States, loving cute objects has historically been written off as escapism at best and a worrying swing toward infancy at worst. Adults who embraced childlike things were “seen to be irresponsibly regressive, morally immature, and refusing to play their full part in society,” May said in an email after we spoke. As recently as 2020, in an article about plushies, one writer self-consciously described her stuffed hound as her “deep dark secret.”

Yet, as I've previously reported, this defensiveness about loving cute objects has been gradually dissipating, part of a century-long evolution in which childhood has come to be seen as a protected life stage. Nowadays, May said, “to be childlike also has an increasingly positive connotation in terms of openness to ideas and freedom from dogmatism.” At the same time, attitudes about what it means to be an adult are shifting. Many have assumed that children are supposed to “grow out of vulnerability” when they become adults, Sandra Chang-Kredl, a professor at Concordia University, in Montreal, who has studied adults' attachments to stuffed animals, told me. But more and more, people are pushing back on that idea. Years ago, “it would have been hard to admit that, let's say, Oh, I have anxiety,” Chang-Kredl said. “Today, there's no shame involved in it.” 

Pop Mart has capitalized on this transformation, marketing Labubus—and its other collectibles—specifically to young adults. The company's social-media posts seem to be aimed at Monday-hating, coffee-drinking workers who might log in to Zoom meetings from disastrously messy rooms or prefer to be outside, playing with buddies (or toys), rather than reporting to an office. Evidence suggests that this approach has been successful; one analysis of Pop Mart's web traffic found that 39 percent of visitors to the online store in April ranged in age from 25 to 34.

Shame dies hard, though, which might be another reason Labubu has gained traction. Within the realm of cute things, a demonic-looking stuffie is more “ugly-cute”—adorable, monstrous, deliberately weird. (Ugly-cuteness is also by no means a new phenomenon; think of the pygmy-hippo sensation Moo Deng, toys such as UglyDolls and Cabbage Patch Kids, or the eternal appeal of the pug.) People “feel that they themselves are a little bit edgy,” Joshua Dale, a cute-studies professor at Chuo University, in Tokyo, told me, “for liking something that some people don't like.”

As with any popular trend, Labubu does have its haters—or at least some tongue-in-cheek provocateurs. People have suggested (semi-jokingly) that the toy is possessed, possibly by a demon called Pazuzu. The singer Katy Perry, at a recent concert in Australia, used her mic to smack a Labubu out of a fan's hand. “No Labubus!” she commanded sternly. Still, Labubu's creepy-cute duality does feel very of this moment, in line with a certain strain of the culture that seeks to undercut anything that feels too buttoned-up. Consider the popularity of “brat”—an irony-tinged aesthetic that embraces the messy and ugly-cute over the prepped and polished. Last year, my colleague Spencer Kornhaber described the “brat” mood as “a little immature, a little selfish, a little nasty.” He also noted that the singer Charli XCX, whose songs affirm that the party-girl life has no age limit, and pop artists such as Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan seem to be making music offering “the assurance that growing up, in the conventional sense, is just optional.”

Wearing Labubu, especially on a designer purse or a backpack meant for grown-ups, is a choice that speaks in a similar register. It signals a “playful attitude to life,” May told me, “a winking at the world.” Monday will come around again, with its dreaded wake-up alarms and emails. But according to the logic of kidulthood, you might feel a tiny bit better if you bring a devilish tchotchke to that 9 a.m. meeting.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Flooding Gaza with food is the only way out of a crisis largely created by Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When Hamas bulldozed its way across the Gaza fence on October 7, 2023, it hoped to eventually provoke the opprobrium that's now flowing in Israel's direction. Launching its carnival of murder, rape, and kidnapping, the group wagered that it could bait its enemy into moral blunders that would discredit it in the eyes of the world.

That vision is now unfolding as mass hunger engulfs the Gaza Strip, and images of starving children crumble American support for Israel. The fact that Hamas ignited this chain of events, and that it could end the war if wanted to, does nothing to absolve Israel of its primary role in the food crisis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government bears responsibility for policies that are now depriving Gazans of adequate nourishment and may soon kill them in staggering numbers. It was his cabinet that imposed a blockade on Gaza starting on March 2. The measure was eventually reversed under international pressure. Still, the subsequent damage was a deliberate choice, because even after Israel lifted its siege, it further limited the ability of the United Nations to distribute relief.

Read: Food aid in Gaza has become a horror

Israel executed these policies in the name of achieving Netanyahu's implausible goal of “total victory.” Food, in his government's analysis, had become a weapon used by Hamas to sustain its fighters, reward loyalty, and replenish its armaments through black-market profiteering. The United Nations, Israeli officials believed, was at best excessively tolerant of terrorists in Gaza. By wresting control of aid distribution from the world organization, Israel hoped to cut Hamas off from one of its last remaining sources of power.

But the policy has failed on its own terms. Hamas is no closer to surrendering or releasing hostages than before Israel embarked on its campaign of deprivation. A movement animated by theological fervor—and strengthened by the spectacle of civilian suffering—cannot be starved into submission. And now that the toll of hunger is becoming so clear, Israel has an obligation to reverse course as quickly as possible.

When there is hunger, the blazingly obvious solution is food. Humanitarian groups have a cliché for what's needed in Gaza: “flooding the zone” with food. That would require Israel to lift restrictions and bureaucratic impediments that it has imposed on the UN agencies it loathes.

Flooding the zone is not just a humanitarian imperative; it is a strategic one for Israel. The food crisis is alienating bedrock allies in the U.S. Congress. When Israel launched its response to the atrocities of October 7, with the goal of dismantling Hamas, I considered the war just and necessary. But international law prohibits some tactics in order to protect the innocent and to prevent the perverse exigencies of conflict from disfiguring the soul of the warrior. Even if Israel is prepared to endure international isolation, allegiances it once considered unbreakable won't survive famine. By flooding the zone, Israel would be rescuing itself.

Just before Israel imposed its blockade on Gaza in early March, a cease-fire prevailed. During the calm, the price of flour—the clearest indicator of a population's nutritional access—plummeted from about $135 for a 25-kilogram sack to just $14 in February. The United Nations, along with the nongovernmental organizations that it coordinates, imported more aid during that period than at any point in the previous eight months: 295,120 tons in total. Although this was hardly a cornucopia, the surge of food and medicine averted large-scale starvation.

The role the United Nations played in this effort wasn't unusual. In major humanitarian crises caused by war—for example, in Sudan and Ukraine—the UN serves as the primary mechanism for coordinating the care of civilians displaced by conflict. In Gaza, its role ran even deeper: For decades, the UN had provided not just emergency relief but also the basic infrastructure of daily life—education, housing, food.

Even as Israel and the UN collaborated on the movement of trucks and the flow of aid, they regarded each other as hostile entities. Israel had legitimate reasons for suspicion. For years, schools administered by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in Gaza used textbooks glorifying violent resistance. After the October 7 attacks, Israel published intelligence showing that 12 UNRWA employees directly participated in the massacre. To many Israelis, the agency's very existence affirmed a long-standing belief that the UN reflexively condemns Israel while overlooking Hamas's genocidal rhetoric.

Photos: Gaza's starvation and chaos

On March 2, the Netanyahu government made a calculated decision to blow up this system. It didn't just block the entry of all goods, including food. That move preluded a string of policies that seem intended to permanently push the UN out of Gaza.

By summer, Israel had refused to renew the visas of top officials at three UN agencies operating in Gaza. (These officials had publicly condemned Israel's obstructionism, voicing accusations of genocide, collective punishment, and political sabotage—rhetoric that infuriated Israeli leaders.) Aid groups navigated a growing tangle of permits and bureaucratic impositions that made the UN's relief efforts in Gaza unworkable. New restrictions gave the government the right to demand the names and contact details of Palestinian staffers and ban any group whose employees have questioned Israel's existence as a Jewish, democratic state.

To replace the UN presence, Israel worked with the Trump administration to hastily design a new system to feed Gaza. Where the old international agencies were run by technical experts and experienced professionals, the new system was concocted by management consultants and private security contractors under the aegis of a newly created nonprofit, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Where the UN had tried to address the full spectrum of civilian needs—medicine, sanitation, nutrition—the GHF largely focuses on food, distributing boxes and bags in just four sites, all in areas fully controlled by the Israeli military, none of them in northern Gaza. This plan transgressed fundamental principles that guide humanitarian work, and the UN announced that it wanted nothing to do with GHF.

The result was predictably disastrous. Hundreds of Palestinians were shot while mobbing soldiers during chaotic food distributions. Whatever the faults of the UN, it remains the world's most capable relief agency. And in Gaza, it had a network of warehouses, bakeries, and kitchens and a pool of local employees. Flooding the zone is simply not possible unless Israel restores the visas of international-aid workers and allows them to operate without the labyrinthine restrictions currently paralyzing their work.

A primary impediment to providing ample food is epistemic closure. That is, many Israelis simply don't believe the warnings of famine, because they doubt the veracity of the evidence. They say that the UN has a history of predicting catastrophes in Gaza that never come to pass. But this time is genuinely different. The price of a sack of flour, which by the end of May had skyrocketed to about $500, tells the story. And although intermittent shortages do not always lead to famine, the nature of a prolonged crisis is that it grinds down the resilience of both the human body and entire communities.

Jeremy Konyndyk, the head of Refugees International, who oversaw disaster relief for the Obama administration, told me: “In the early months of the war, if you cut off all the food, people are starting from a place where they're still healthy. They still have money and resources. They have assets they can sell. There are still stockpiles of food. So there's a lot more of what we in humanitarian terms would call a ‘coping mechanism.'” But those mechanisms, he said, are now gone.

That's true not just for the recipients of aid but also for those delivering it. Relief networks rely heavily on Gazans to move and distribute food. “Like on an airplane,” Konyndyk said, “you put on your own mask before helping others. That applies here. We need to stabilize the aid providers in order to enable them to scale up the operation.”

Read: The corrupt bargain behind Gaza's catastrophe

The thoroughfares that would carry food to the hungry are in no better shape. Sixty-eight percent of Gaza's roads are damaged, according to the UN, and will require Israeli engineers to regrade and pave them. (Israeli crews have made roads passable on multiple occasions over the course of the war.) David Satterfield, a longtime American diplomat who coordinated the distribution of aid in Gaza during the Biden administration, told me that the continued warfare has “just physically disrupted the ability of aid implementers to get their stuff to warehouses, from warehouses to distribution points.”

As hunger deepens, trucks navigating these roads become ever more vulnerable to mobs desperate to plunder the contents. Crowds descend to loot out of fear that waiting in line means getting nothing. Humanitarians call this “self-distribution.” There is no functioning government to secure the convoys. Even if Gaza were inundated with food, the looting would likely persist—until the supply became so reliable that people stopped fearing it might vanish.

Every image of a child with protruding ribs is both a human tragedy and a propaganda victory for Hamas—and proof of how a just war badly lost the plot. I believed in Israel's casus belli. I don't believe in this. No justification can redeem the immorality of a policy built on deprivation. As Gaza braces for the worst, Israel still has a narrow window to correct its course. By flooding the zone, Israel has one last chance to redeem itself.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

After my father got sick, his collaborations with Jim Henson kept me afloat.

Jim Henson's Creature Shop has sat, for the past 16 years, on the fourth floor of an office building in Long Island City, New York, behind a metal door that looks like any other. When I opened it one gray morning after the holidays, I was greeted by a plastic Christmas tree hung with fake fish skeletons and desiccated banana peels, Oscar leering nearby from his can, and a brown, fuzzy blob sitting on a table. At first I thought it might be a complete Muppet, until I saw, a few yards beyond, a matching brown, fuzzy, headless body. As the archivist Karen Falk began to lead me on a tour of the workshop—drawers of googly eyes, noses, and “special facial hair”; filing cabinets for “fur” and “slippery sleezy”; a stack of banker's boxes, one marked “Grover,” another “Boober”—I looked back, briefly, to catch the bulbous nose and round eyes of Junior Gorg from Fraggle Rock staring at me, or perhaps at his own body, waiting to be reunited.

“There are only three Snuffleupagi in the world,” Falk told me, gesturing toward a puppet near the entrance that she said was kind of an extra, deployed when Snuffleupagus needs a family member on set next to him. I reached out to give Snuffy's relation a little pet—his soft brown fur, curly and dense like a poodle's, was overlain with orange feathers—and scribbled a note: “remarkably lifelike.” For a what? I later asked myself. For a giant woolly mammoth cum anteater puppet? But the space made it easy to slip across the human-Muppet divide and into Henson's world, where the realness of the puppets is sacrosanct. When I asked to take a picture of the decapitated Junior Gorg, just for my notes, Falk looked at me as if I'd asked to check under Miss Piggy's dress. “We don't allow photos of things like that, Muppets without heads,” she tutted, and ushered me to another part of the workshop, where a handful of archival boxes had been set aside for me.

After a great loss, some people find themselves communing with nature, at the seaside or deep in a forest. Others turn to spirituality, toward a temple or church. Me? I'd come to grieve with the Muppets.

My father, Marshall, amassed many accolades over the course of his career—a gold record for playing bluegrass banjo on the Deliverance soundtrack; an Oscar for co-writing the script of Annie Hall; a Tony nomination for Best Book for the musical Jersey Boys, which won Best Musical in 2006 (and an Olivier Award, too)—but way cooler to me, as a kid, was the fact that for a brief stint, long before I was born, he'd been part of Henson's crew.

For much of my life, I knew little about the specifics. I do remember one time being feverish and crying for a Kermit doll after a doctor's appointment, even though, despite Dad's involvement in the show, I can't remember ever watching any Muppets, or even Sesame Street, at home. The local toy store was all sold out, so Dad called in a favor, and we headed to the old Muppet offices on the Upper East Side to pick one up. While we were waiting, I watched, slack-jawed, as puppet makers working on a new creation pulled googly eyes out of thin drawers, one after another, a fever dream come to life and branded in my memory like a surrealist madeleine. After that, the Muppets all but receded from my life.

Read: The secret life of grief

That changed after my father got sick last year, when my daily life became not just a logistical mire—managing therapy appointments, speaking with doctors—but also one of constant dread: about which Dad I'd find when I walked into his room each day, his personality somehow refracted, as if I were looking at it through a prism; about whether a middle-of-the-night phone call might signify an Earth-tilting inflection point; about how devastating it was going to be to navigate the world without the beloved father I'd always looked up to.

At the end of each day, like any well-adjusted individual faced with looming, profound change, I chose to run screaming as far away from reality as I could, which is how I ended up in the arms of the 1970s Muppets. I had no grand plan. I simply gravitated toward their fluffiness and goofiness as an antidote to grief. I sensed—rightly, it turned out—that they'd help keep me afloat.

Dad and Henson first connected through Al Gottesman, Henson's longtime lawyer. Their mutual affinity makes total sense to me, even a generation later. They were born three years apart and grew up delighting in Kukla, Fran and Ollie, and Walt Kelly's Pogo comic strip. They shared an off-kilter sense of humor and a reverence for the silly. Although I can't remember ever seeing Dad with a puppet on his hand, when I was growing up he would put on elaborate bedtime shows for my sister and me, starring our menagerie of stuffed animals. Using a pair of needle-nose pliers from his tool case—a bulky, black-leather valise full of primary-colored screwdrivers I liked to play with, a relic from his days attending Brooklyn Technical High School to appease his practical immigrant father—he made pince-nez out of a paper clip for my plush dachshund, Ollirina, a feisty Southern grande dame who propelled herself around by farting (my contribution); he then had her perform miraculous acts of levitation. Dad's tried-and-true finale: shooting my Ping-Pong-ball-sized plush hedgehog through a toilet-paper-roll cannon as I drumrolled on my lap. Looking back on this now that I'm a parent of three young children, I marvel that he could summon this level of creativity after dinnertime.

For a few months in the mid-'70s, Dad helped Henson write a failed Broadway Muppets revue, and what would become the pilot of The Muppet Show, called “Sex and Violence With the Muppets”—Henson's attempt to establish the Muppets as not just for kids. Dad is listed as head writer on the script, in which Nigel, Sam the Eagle, and a few other Muppets put together a “Seven Deadly Sins” pageant to determine which sin is the most deadly. Although the final show evolved from the pilot—Kermit replaced Nigel as the emcee; a human guest star was added—you can see from the script that its style was already developed, as was its tone: equal parts outlandish and sophisticated, countercultural, never talking down to the audience. Sloth arrives, of course, during the closing credits, too late to participate. One stage direction reads, simply, “Chaos in progress.” The script established the framework with which Henson would go on to parody a vaudeville show from all angles—the divas (Piggy), the technical malfunctions (Crazy Harry, blowing up sets left and right), the well-meaning guy trying to hold the whole ball of crazy together (Kermit).

My father's contributions are impossible to disentangle from the general Muppetness of the script—collaborations work, he always told me, because they are collaborative—save for one: Despite being Brooklyn born and bred, with not a Nordic bone in his body, he is, by many accounts, the source of the Swedish Chef's accent and nonsense lexicon, the one typified by “Hurdy, gurdy, gurdy, bork bork bork!” The character had originated with Henson in the '60s. Back then, he'd been German. For reasons lost to Muppetdom, at some point the character moved northwest, to a place with more centralized health care. And he needed an accent to match.

I loved listening to Dad parody foreign languages. He liked to throw off telemarketers by answering the phone as a hard-of-hearing woman from some indeterminate Latin American country, or as an eccentric Central European man, characterized by a sibilant, Peter Sellers–as–Strangelove delivery that would typically escalate into a shriek and send the person on the other end skedaddling to their next call. So I was not surprised to learn that, decades earlier, Dad had apparently reduced the Henson puppeteer Frank Oz to tears by mimicking languages during brainstorming sessions. He later made an ersatz-Swedish tape for Henson to listen to on his commute into the city from his home in Bedford. “He would drive to work trying to make a chicken sandwich in mock Swedish or make a turkey casserole in mock Swedish,” Henson's son Brian told Jim's biographer, remembering having heard my dad's tape. “It was the most ridiculous thing you had ever seen, and people at traffic lights used to stop and sort of look at him a little crazy.”

All of this I learned from books, from interviews with Muppet staffers, and by emailing Falk, the Henson archivist. But the bulk of my embedding in Muppetdom over the past year involved watching The Muppet Show with my husband and three kids on weekend evenings, our world cocooned between the real, live present and a completely nonsensical 1970s. I'd slice up some apples and we'd cackle together as Rita Moreno flung a noodly Muppet man around set in a particularly violent tango; as Zero Mostel, only mildly indignant that a Muppet was eating him during his cold open, helped wash down his own arm with a little water; as Gene Kelly taught Kermit to tap-dance on the piano.

Read: The father-daughter routine that transformed our family life

Given what I'd learned, was it a cosmic sign that my youngest, just 3 years old, started to develop an obsession with the Swedish Chef? He took to running around the apartment, crowing his bastardized version of the Chef's already bastardized Swedish and then, mimicking his new Nordic hero, flinging into the air whatever he had handy. Sometimes it was a stuffed animal; other times it was hard objects, which would necessitate a stern lecture (after my husband and I had taken cover) about the dangers of throwing things up, because they tend to come down, even if the Chef's flapjacks do not. After my son got a Swedish Chef action-figure set that included a small chicken and a handful of cooking tools, he would sit on the ground, brow furrowed in concentration, making the cleaver-wielding chef hop after the chicken—or sometimes, in keeping with Muppet sensibility, vice versa.

My daughters became obsessed with “Pigs in Space,” a recurring Muppet sketch parodying Star Trek and other space operas of the 1960s and '70s. They erupted in cheers whenever the USS Swinetrek flew across the screen, indicating that the sketch was back again. The setup is that three pigs are flying through the cosmos—Captain Link Hogthrob, Dr. Julius Strangepork, and Miss Piggy as first mate—and … nothing really happens. John Cleese shows up as a pirate and tries to make a call from a payphone on the ship, while his parrot, who is in love with him, gripes that Cleese is neglecting her and should take her to dinner with all his doubloons. The ship is invaded by two alien beings, who turn out to be the Swedish Chef and his chicken, and after they leave, the pigs get bored. When the USS Swinetrek nears the end of the universe, where its crew will finally discover the meaning and purpose of life, the dinner bell rings, and the pigs get sidetracked. Miss Piggy is routinely degraded, asked by the boars to do the laundry or make more swill, though the audience understands that she's smarter and tougher than her male co-stars.

According to Oz, Miss Piggy's puppeteer, her toughness was hard-won. In multiple interviews, he has spoken about his need to understand the complete biographies of the characters he portrayed, even if viewers don't share that need. In Oz's mind, Miss Piggy was born on a farm, loved her father very much, and was grief-stricken when he died in a tractor accident. As her mother's subsequent suitors turned their attention to Miss Piggy, a single path forward emerged: to leave. She was later forced to do some things she wasn't proud of as she clawed her way to diva-dom, including appearing in a bacon commercial.

Does any of that come through the screen as she floats around in outer space? I suppose that, for some viewers, it does—that having a deep understanding of Miss Piggy's character somehow enabled Oz and the other puppeteers to present her simulated world as real enough that the audience would jump into it with her, feetfirst, willingly suspending disbelief.

Or maybe that's not why it works. “It's just so weird,” my third grader said to me one night, with a snort. “Like, why are there even pigs in space?”

I didn't experience what others warned me I might, after the months of decline that led to Dad's death late last year: picking up the phone to call him and forgetting that there would be no one on the other end, looking up from the sidewalk at the window where he worked for decades, expecting to see the light on and being knocked sideways that it was dark. I never forgot. I never expected the light to be on. But occasionally, I'd find myself dropping from one reality straight through to another, something most likely aided by my living just eight blocks from where I grew up. My neighborhood is saturated with memories spanning my whole life.

Passing a street corner, I would suddenly reverse-age four decades and see Dad's belt buckle sliding along my tricycle's handlebars, because I was so hot and sweaty and tired that I simply couldn't pedal one more inch, and he was pulling me around that corner, home. I'd be running the Lower Loop in Central Park, where we used to take our daily afternoon walks, and I'd pass a busker playing the fiddle and have to stop, hands on knees, to catch my breath, remembering the Flatt and Scruggs Dad played through his computer speakers. These temporal shifts through eras were uncontrolled, unexpected, all-encompassing. My scrim between reality and memory, truth and simulation, had become porous, faulty. Like the Swedish Chef, who starts making a turtle soup only to find that the turtle has woken up and is trying to escape, my reality was pitched, slightly, on its axis.

The first time one of these temporal shifts through eras, one of these free falls from today back to childhood, happened was a few nights after the burial. My husband, kids, and I gathered, the children freshly showered and damp-haired, and put on the Muppets, as we'd done, at that point, for months. The episode featured Señor Wences, the ventriloquist whose main act involved Johnny, a boy made from Wences's hand, on which he stuck two googly eyes, and on top of which he draped a ridiculous orange wig. His other star performers were a bespectacled chicken named Cecilia (Wences: “Second name?”; Cecilia: “Chicken”) and Pedro, a surly talking head (literally just a head, not an MSNBC type) who, after a train accident that decapitated the poor puppet, spent his life, disembodied, in a box.

The episode's conceit was that Kermit has decided to do something new: a puppet show! “It's a complete change of pace, folks,” he said to cheers. “Yes, it's a real first!” Toward the end, Wences held up an egg and asked Cecilia Chicken to identify it. As she replied, softly and directly, “My son” (rhymes with moan), a memory of childhood weekend breakfasts welled up from deep in my subconscious, collapsing time just as the puppets on-screen were collapsing their simulation. I saw the kitchen table, the oval wooden one my father had waxed by hand until it shone. I felt its slight stickiness beneath my hands. And by the stove was Dad, apron halved and tied around his waist, holding up an egg reverently, sighing, lovingly pronouncing it “my son!” in Salamancan-inflected English, then cracking it, with a flourish, into a cast-iron skillet.

He used to do that with eggs.

I'd completely forgotten. For a moment, I stayed there at the kitchen table, giggling. I stayed with the feeling of being closer to my children's age than middle age; closer to those evenings spent cross-legged and damp-haired myself, watching my dad turn stuffed animals into performers; closer still to a moment years before my birth, when, across town at the Henson studios, in a healthy body with long legs kicked up on the desk in front of him, my dad held a bulky tape recorder to his mouth, paused, then started up for the first time in ersatz Swedish, the beginning of a thread that would reach out, decades later, and tether him to me.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The only things keeping America out of a recession are robots and healthcare.

The US economy is bending — but not yet breaking — beneath the weight of President Donald Trump's nationalist agenda.

That is the story told by an avalanche of economic data released last week.

According to those new figures, employers are pulling back on hiring to a dramatic (and unexpected) degree, economic growth is slowing, and consumer prices are rising. And there are strong indications that Trump's trade and immigration policies are driving all of these trends.

While last week's data provides little sign of an imminent recession or inflationary crisis, protectionism is still imposing a heavy toll on US households and businesses. And if hiring continues to slow — while firms' input costs persistently rise — there is some risk that economic growth could stall out completely.

Unfortunately, Trump chose to compound that risk on Thursday by doubling down on his radical trade restrictions, imposing tariffs of between 10 percent and 50 percent on the imports of all foreign countries.

Here is a quick overview of America's darkening economic picture.

America's labor market is much weaker than previously thought, a Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report revealed on Friday. US employers added 73,000 jobs in July, far fewer than the 104,000 that economists expected.

More alarmingly, the report suggested that job growth was markedly weaker in May and June than the government had previously believed. The BLS always revises its estimates of monthly employment gains, once more data becomes available. Usually, these updates do not fundamentally change the labor market outlook. This time, they did.

The government initially thought that employers had added 144,000 jobs in May and 147,000 in June; it now believes that they added just 19,000 during the first month and 14,000 during the second. (Trump responded to this unwelcome information by declaring it fraudulent and firing the head of the BLS.)

This updated data suggests that Trump's tariffs (and tariff threats) have had a detrimental impact on hiring. After he unveiled his plans for sweeping universal tariffs on April 1, employment in America's manufacturing and “trade and transport” industries abruptly declined:

Trump's supporters may find it surprising that the enactment of broad tariffs would coincide with a reduction in manufacturing employment. After all, Trump has often described his trade policies as a strategy for creating factory jobs.

But the recent contraction in manufacturing employment makes perfect sense: Trump engineered a large increase in US producers' costs by making foreign-made metal, lumber, semiconductors, and myriad other industrial materials more expensive. This makes it harder for US manufacturers to expand hiring or gain global market share, as they are now less cost-competitive than rivals in countries without large tariffs.

As trade-sensitive sectors have shed workers, employment growth has become almost entirely dependent on the health care sector, which has accounted for nearly all of the economy's new jobs added in the past three months.

The latest data on US economic growth tells a similarly disquieting story.

America's gross domestic product officially grew at a 3 percent annual rate in the second quarter, after decreasing by 0.5 percent in the first quarter. But both of those figures are misleading. This is because Trump's trade policies have greatly exacerbated well-known flaws in the government's approach to calculating GDP. The reasons for this are a bit complex, but the upshot is that the government likely underestimated growth in the first quarter and overestimated it in the second, due to massive, tariff-induced swings in US imports.

Thus, to get a clear picture of the economy's growth rate, it's best to look at GDP trends over the first two quarters combined. And over the first half of this year, America's gross domestic product expanded at a 1.2 percent annualized clip — a much slower pace than both its growth rate in 2024 (2.8 percent) and forecasters' expectations for 2025 GDP growth when Trump was elected last November (2.1 percent).

As with employment gains, America's GDP growth is highly imbalanced: An explosion in AI infrastructure spending is playing an outsize part in sustaining our economic expansion. Over the past six months, the artificial intelligence buildout has contributed more to American economic growth than all of consumer spending, according to the Wall Street Journal's Christopher Mims. Should anything cause America's tech companies to pull back on data center construction, the US economy could quickly sputter.

Trump's trade and immigration policies likely explain the bulk of this slowdown in growth. Through ramped-up internal enforcement and restrictions on legal immigration, Trump has succeeded in shrinking America's foreign-born labor force while deterring the arrival of new migrants. Largely as a result of his policies, America has shed 1.7 million immigrant workers since March. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve of Dallas estimated that Trump's immigration policies will lower annual GDP growth by about 0.8 percentage points.

Meanwhile, Trump's tariffs are almost certainly dampening both consumer spending (by generating high prices that deter shoppers) and business investment (by raising input costs and uncertainty). As of last Wednesday, Yale's Budget Lab estimated that Trump's tariffs would lower real GDP growth annually by 0.5 percentage points. Trump's most recent batch of duties will almost certainly lower growth even further.

Typically, when economic growth slows, inflation tends to cool. After all, lower consumer spending and business investment translates into reduced demand for goods and services. And when the demand declines, sellers are often forced to cut prices.

Yet inflation in the US today is actually accelerating, even as growth slackens. Consumer prices in June were 2.6 percent higher than they had been one year earlier, according to Commerce Department data released last week.

Food and energy prices tend to shift volatilely, so economists often focus on “core” inflation, which excludes both categories. And core prices in June were 2.8 percent higher than 12 months earlier.

Both of these rates were higher than they had been in May. And the underlying data strongly indicates that Trump's tariffs are largely responsible for inflation's resurgence.

Over the past three months, the prices of non-housing services (such as air travel or car insurance) grew at a 1.85 percent annualized rate. That's an encouraging data point, as services had been the major driver of inflation last year.

But a sharp rise in goods prices counteracted that disinflation, with core goods prices climbing at a 3.7 percent annualized clip in the second quarter. And price growth has been concentrated in trade-sensitive goods, such as home furnishings and electronics.

In short, the data suggests that America plausibly would have enjoyed a return to the Fed's 2 percent target inflation rate this year, had Trump not manufactured a surge in the cost of imported goods.

America's economy still shows some signs of life.

The unemployment rate remains at 4.2 percent, a relatively low level by historic standards. And after falling by 0.3 percent in May, inflation-adjusted consumer spending ticked up by 0.1 percent in June. Meanwhile, aggregate weekly payrolls — the sum of all wages paid to private-sector workers in a given week — was 5.3 percent higher in July than one year earlier. This represents an improvement relative to June, when total weekly wages were up just 4.5 percent on the year.

US consumers still boast significant spending power. The AI arms race doesn't appear to be ending anytime soon. And Trump's recent package of tax cuts — while detrimental to growth in the long term — could boost demand in the short run. Perhaps for these reasons, betting markets currently give the US economy an 85 percent chance of avoiding a recession by year's end.

Nevertheless, America's economic outlook is much gloomier than it was one week ago. Trump's trade policies have already nudged the US toward stagflation, a simultaneous rise in inflation and stagnation of growth. And most of Trump's tariffs have yet to actually take effect.

Many sectors are already responding to rising import costs by shedding payroll. If that trend continues, and unemployment rises, consumer spending will likely dip. Faced with less demand, more employers will need to lay off staff, which would further erode spending. A recessionary spiral could ensue.

The Federal Reserve may try to preempt that dynamic by cutting interest rates in September. But if Trump's tariffs continue to lift consumer prices, the central bank could find itself at an impasse: The Fed normally raises interest rates when prices are too high, and cuts them when job growth is too slow. If both those conditions prevail at once, the Fed will find itself with no good options.

Regardless, this much is clear: Americans are already less prosperous and economically secure than we would have been, had Trump not curtailed our nation's access to foreign-made goods and immigrant workers.

The long legal battle over gig worker benefits may be finally ending.

Should independent contractors get employment benefits? The question has fueled decades of legal and political battles — and it might finally be coming to an end for the roughly 58 million people who currently work as freelancers, contractors and gig workers across America.

Three Republican senators — led by Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who chairs the chamber's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee — have introduced bills to expand benefits like health insurance and retirement savings for contractors. The legislation would protect companies from worker misclassification lawsuits if they offered contractors non-salary perks, and Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley (CA) introduced companion bills back in February.

Advocates of these so-called portable benefits argue that they support the realities of the current workplace. In 1947, Congress explicitly carved out independent contractors from the National Labor Relations Act's definition of “employee.” Today, most contractors say they'd prefer to keep their independent arrangements but want more financial stability. Cassidy has hailed passing these bills a top priority for him this year.

The portable benefits most likely to pass now, however, are less robust and worker-friendly than some progressive Democrats were envisioning ten years ago. Back in 2015, tech entrepreneur Nick Hanauer and David Rolf, former SEIU president of the Seattle Local 775, pitched a proposal where employers would contribute $2 an hour to a “shared security system.”

Benefits would accrue by the hour, pool across multiple jobs, and be accessible whether someone worked for one company full-time or five part-time. A year later, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) outlined a different approach: Instead of requiring employers to pay in, she proposed building public systems that would let workers take benefits like health care and retirement from job to job. In his final State of the Union address that year, Barack Obama also endorsed the general idea, emphasizing that “basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today.”

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

But unions strongly opposed these efforts. Labor groups have long fought against worker misclassification, where wrongly designating employees as contractors allows employers to sidestep payroll taxes, unemployment insurance, minimum wage laws and other obligations. Unions view codifying portable benefits largely as a way to keep misclassifying workers and therefore cut them off from core workplace protections, including the right to unionize.

Unions and union-funded nonprofits argue that portable benefits offer a false choice between job security and flexibility, and point to examples like nurses and restaurant workers where employees can still enjoy more flexible environments. The portable benefits approach, they warn, will just hasten the outsourcing of work to contractors or encourage more companies to misclassify their staff. They point to lobbying efforts by companies reliant on contractors, like DoorDash and Lyft, as well as lobbying by advocacy groups funded by Instacart, Uber, and Grubhub.

For a time, it seemed that Democrats might fight for a more progressive version of portable benefits: Warren in her 2016 speech talked about extending union rights to temp and gig workers, and the Hanauer/Rolf proposal resembled how most European countries administer job protections. But the politics of the last seven years have instead shifted the party's focus toward narrowing the legal definition of independent contracting and reclassifying more workers as traditional employees.

This approach is a cornerstone of the Protecting Right to Organize (PRO) Act, a union-backed federal labor reform bill that passed the House in 2021, was enthusiastically endorsed by President Joe Biden, and currently has 44 Democratic sponsors in the Senate. Yet the bill stands little chance of becoming law any time soon — and in the meantime, Republicans have taken up the issue with a more employer-friendly bent.

With a few exceptions, most Democrats have stopped talking about securing portable benefits for freelancers who want to remain independent. But the need to protect gig workers hasn't gone away; both their numbers and their vulnerability continue to rise. The long-running policy battle may finally be winding down—just not in a way that necessarily helps them.

The fight over worker classification stretches back decades, but a good starting place is 2006, when a group of FedEx Home Delivery drivers in Massachusetts voted to unionize. The company refused to bargain, arguing the drivers were independent contractors and therefore ineligible for a union. Although the National Labor Relations Board sided with the drivers in 2007, deeming them employees eligible to unionize, the DC Circuit overturned that ruling in 2009, and asserted the NLRB “has no authority whatsoever over independent contractors.”

Undeterred, the Obama-era NLRB ruled in favor of a different group of FedEx drivers in 2014, declaring them to be employees, not contractors. (The NLRB does not treat rulings other than those from the US Supreme Court as binding.) By 2015, the Obama Labor Department also issued guidance clarifying that most workers should be considered employees. But the Trump administration reversed both efforts, and in 2017 the DC Circuit again sided with FedEx.

The pendulum swung back — to classifying more workers as employees — under Biden, only to shift again under Trump in his second term.

The politics started to change in 2018, when the California Supreme Court issued a landmark decision sharply limiting when companies could classify workers as contractors. In response, California lawmakers in 2019 passed a law known as AB 5, functionally codifying the decision's stringent “ABC test”— a standard that defines most workers as employees. Under the ABC test, one can only be considered a contractor if they do work that falls outside the company's typical line of business.

Gig companies began fighting back. In 2020, tech giants like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash successfully spent $200 million on a California ballot measure to exempt drivers from AB 5 in exchange for requiring companies to provide contractors with some limited benefits. The gig companies also turned their attention outside of California, working aggressively to prevent laws like AB 5 from spreading.

In 2022 they prevailed in Washington state, which passed a law that provides limited benefits to gig workers in exchange for maintaining their independent contractor status. The Washington law was backed by the local Teamsters affiliate of drivers and the Washington State Labor Council, but vocally opposed by Sean O'Brien, the Teamsters' international president.

Labor groups seeking to slow the momentum of portable benefits scored a win in 2021, when the strict “ABC standard” was included in the Democratic Party's PRO Act. While a few tech-friendly Democrats continue to elevate the issue of protecting gig workers with portable benefits, most in the party have gone quiet on the subject, as doing so would be seen as undercutting a core goal of the PRO Act. The Democrats' central focus now is on reclassifying gig workers as employees, not protecting contractors with flexible benefits.

Another political turning point came in 2023, when Utah lawmakers passed the country's first voluntary portable benefits law, enabling companies to contribute benefits to independent contractors without affecting their contractor status or implying employer liability. Companies like Shipt and Lyft started piloting new benefits for Utah workers months after the law took effect.

In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro last year initiated a portable benefits pilot with DoorDash, and Georgia, Maryland, and Tennessee have taken their own steps this year. Supporters say these new voluntary laws will give companies the confidence to provide workers with more competitive working conditions, and they point to preliminary results from Pennsylvania, where 4,400 DoorDash drivers signed up for the savings account program, and earned $400 on average in their first year.

Labor leaders remain skeptical, warning this all may amount to little more than PR — or a way to treat workers like employees without providing real support.

Independent contractors already have the ability to contribute to tax-deductible retirement savings plans known as Simplified Employee Pension plans, or SEP-IRAs. But under current law, employers can't also contribute to those plans without risking legal challenges.

Cassidy's new proposal, the Independent Retirement Fairness Act, would amend federal law to allow employers to voluntarily contribute, while shielding businesses from having to provide broader employment benefits or protections. It's unclear whether companies would actually take advantage of this new freedom, though supporters point out that most private-sector retirement plans in the US are voluntary.

In terms of health insurance, independent workers can already obtain portable coverage via the Affordable Care Act but a quarter of contractors lack coverage, typically because it's too expensive. This year, the average 40-year-old buying unsubsidized health insurance on the exchanges paid nearly $500 per month, while a family of four paid close to $1,600.

Yet Republicans are not proposing to increase subsidies to independent contractors seeking health insurance on the exchanges. Indeed they just approved slashing subsidies to the Affordable Care Act, meaning those with coverage could see their premiums skyrocket, and millions more lose insurance altogether.

Rather, Cassidy is looking to allow contractors to purchase pooled options known as Association Health Plans (AHPs), which might provide lower premiums but come with far fewer protections, for example, AHPs frequently lack coverage for preexisting conditions and preventative services. AHPs were originally meant to be options for businesses in the same industry or geographic area but in 2018 the Trump administration tried to expand them to let loosely affiliated groups — like freelancers — buy coverage together and avoid many Affordable Care Act requirements. A federal judge struck down that effort in 2019, saying it unlawfully stretched the definition of “employer” and was clearly designed to evade the ACA's consumer protections.

Republicans reviving that effort now could both skim healthy, young individuals off the ACA exchanges, and mislead workers into plans far more skimpy and unregulated than they realized.

“In an ideal system employers would have no role in health insurance, but even in our current system, it typically would be better for workers to get subsidized health care on the individual exchanges than AHPs,” said Matt Bruenig, the head of the left-wing People's Policy Project think tank. “These benefits don't seem like they would be much improvement at all, and could make things worse if they are a trojan horse for badly regulated AHPs.”

Warren criticized Cassidy's proposal, but did not elaborate regarding where she falls today on portable benefits. “I have always believed that all workers deserve access to quality health care and benefits, but unfortunately this Republican effort isn't about getting workers the benefits they deserve,” she told Vox in an emailed statement. “This GOP legislation is about giving employers freedom to misclassify workers and deprive them of crucial workplace rights — including the right to form a union and be free from harassment.”

After nearly two decades of legal battles, Congress may finally be ready to declare victory on aiding contractors. But the workers at the center of the fight may end up with little more than they started with.

A summer program running on magic, swords, and financial precarity.

Welcome to Money Talks, a series in which we interview people about their relationship with money, their relationship with each other, and how those relationships inform one another.

Eric Love, 47, is an artist and educator in Haverhill, Massachusetts. After spending the first half of his career working as an educator and consultant, he became the founder of LARP Adventure Program (LAP), an after-school and summer camp program. LAP's curriculum focuses on building community and teaching creative problem-solving through live-action role-playing — a type of structured, interactive game in which players, often rooted in the worlds of science fiction or fantasy, work together to overcome a specific challenge. 

Elle Dunne, 22, is a recent graduate of Wellesley College who began working for LAP as a counselor and is now the marketing coordinator. LAP currently serves over 100 youth, adults, and their families with programs including classes, weekend events, and residential overnight camps up to four weeks.

The following conversation is lightly condensed and edited.

ERIC: I'm Eric Love, and I founded LARP Adventure Program. It came into being as an LLC in 2012, but the idea existed far before that. The earliest rendition of what it is today was from about 2000 — but I wasn't exposed to live-action role-playing as a medium yet.

I was using Dungeons and Dragons as a platform for education, and frustrated about trying to bring it to life. Two of my students were like, “This already exists! It's called LARPing! You should come to an event!” I was like, “Oh, this is great!” I didn't even go to another LARP; I just went to the drawing board and executed the curriculum design.

It's been a committed journey, for sure. I have a fine arts background, a fine and performing arts BA, and a masters of education from Lesley. When I went to Lesley University, I had the LARP program already in mind and I used the masters program to polish it and make it what it is today.

“Everyone still had this idea that if kids pretend any type of combat, that they will become harmful people. That's not how this works, right?”

ELLE: I came on board last June. I ambitiously googled “LARP camp Massachusetts jobs near me,” because I wanted to work at a LARP camp!

I joined as a counselor, and they didn't have anybody doing marketing, and I went up to them and said, “I could do marketing for you guys!” And they're like, “We don't know if we want that.” And I went, “No, I'm going to do marketing for you guys.”

ERIC: We're the longest-running LARP in Massachusetts and possibly the Northeast, it's hard to tell.

I was like, “I'm going to drop everything else I'm doing and figure out how to do this.” And it was too soon, right? [When I was developing the idea] everyone still had this idea that if kids pretend any type of combat, that they will become harmful people. That's not how this works, right? That's not how that happens. But people were scared. People were scared of optics. What do parents think? What do other schools think? What are the psychological implications of children playing pretend and socializing with each other? And the answer is — they become healthier humans that want to contribute to society.

ELLE: I love our kids. I'm going to just take a moment to brag about them. Every day, I wake up and think, “We have the best kids in the world.” I'm so proud of them.

We have a very large population of LGBT and neurodivergent kids that we are very passionate about both protecting and creating a safe space for. LARP has always attracted a specific type of community — it's always been the people who are on the margins and the outskirts and they're using LARP to empower themselves, create something with other people, or figure out who they are. Eric has done something really amazing where he's created an environment where that can happen for kids.

“It's always been the people who are on the margins and the outskirts and they're using LARP to empower themselves, create something with other people, or figure out who they are.”

At the beginning of every day camp, we get a bunch of kids and all they want to do is hit each other with swords. All they want to do is whale on each other and they want to be the hero. And one of the missions of LAP, which I loved — and one of the reasons I chose LAP as opposed to the three other LARP camps in New England — is that this community mind is so important. The kids have a rallying cry: “Fight together, die alone.”

So at the beginning of every day camp Eric and I come in — or whoever the teacher is — and we sit the kids down and we say, “LARP is not for kids, it's for adults. We're trusting you guys to do this adult thing because we think you deserve it and you have the capacity for it. But if you guys do shenanigans, if you are cruel to each other, if you try to be the hero at somebody else's expense, no more. We're sending you to robotics camp or Minecraft camp where it's not as fun.”

Sometimes the kids come in and they're ungovernable monsters, but through this curriculum of radical empathy and community-building and martial arts and self-mastery, they grow into these people with really strong bonds for each other. They discover who they are and they discover what it means to be a leader and they grow up and they give that back.

ERIC: Affordability is a problem across the board. We could change the quality of what we're doing, but it's because of the high quality — there's not just showing up to LARP. You could be a [counselor-in-training], you could help run logistics, you could help be a part of the production team or the writing team. It has all these factors so that everyone has a place, and when the LARP comes together, everyone has something to do depending on what their skill set is and a place to shine. That takes a lot of hours. There's at least 20,000 volunteer hours a year — just unpaid, people showing up week after week. So it's not just money. The burnout is very real.

“One of the kids that I love dearly came up to me and he's like, ‘I can't afford to go to res camp this year,' and that just broke my heart!” 

ELLE: We have our upcoming residential camp at the end of August. Kids are clamoring for that, but we had to hike the price from last year and shorten the length. We also have this problem where we don't have a home, so we're finding issues finding locations to host camps. One of the kids that I love dearly came up to me and he's like, “I can't afford to go to res camp this year,” and that just broke my heart!

You want all the kids to be able to come to camp. You want them to be able to have this magical fantasy experience soaked in SEL [social-emotional learning] education that you know will make them better humans. But you also know that you can't afford land, and you don't own land, so you need to hike up the price. There seems to be a push and pull between, “What do we owe to our community?” and what we need to keep this business surviving.

ERIC: We did as much as can happen for cutbacks. I'm in my mother's house at 47. It's like, “Go get another job.” Well, then who's going to do all of the work that I'm doing? It would be like a house of cards.

We could just keep jacking up the price, but that's going to change the clients. The people that we care about and love are already telling us they can't afford it. We're already seeing people fall off.

When I started this business, my dad was like, “I'm going to give you the money I would give you at whatever retirement. Here's $10,000. And I'm going to give you two bits of advice: ‘You can focus on marketing and selling a product, or you can focus on having a good product. You cannot do both.'”

“If I need to pay my bills and buy groceries, what am I going to cut out first? It's the after-school program that my kid goes to.”

We know we have a really good service. We know it's very special. We know it creates a safe place for people to explore who they are and create self-confidence — but we are just not a machine set up to do heavy marketing and pull people in and convince them to come in.

The reality is small businesses have been dying off rapidly in the last two years. I do arts — alternative education — that gets cut out first. If I need to pay my bills and buy groceries, what am I going to cut out first? It's the after-school program that my kid goes to.

ELLE: One of our kids told me, “I wish I could do LARP, but my parents said I'm going to a different camp.”

ERIC: There's camps where lots of kids are being given laptops, and iPads, and other electronic devices. Our thing has always been, even before the pandemic, “Get off of the computer!” It's okay, we're all gamers, we love it, but socialize with each other and get out in nature! I think that the generations that are coming up, or even the parents, don't identify with the value of what we're bringing forth. Maybe they pitch it to the kid, and they're like, “Yeah, but the Minecraft camp, I get to be on a laptop.”

The only reason why I'm still in it is because I know that this is my self-actualization. And the other part of it, besides that, which is self-fulfilling, is that everyone that I'm around is amazing. My staff are the best people I've ever met. The people who are volunteering are the most exceptional humans I've ever met. That's a very special, sacred thing, and what do you say — do you leave that for money?

ELLE: I hope that we have enough community that we are able to produce the work that we love for the kids that we love in the way that we love it, in a way that we're not sweating over what it's going to cost us emotionally, physically, financially. Just, that level of stability where we have the things we need in order to do the thing we know makes a difference.

Have you ever thought about American Eagle this much in your life?

Declaring that an actor has great jeans should technically be a boring way to sell denim. And yet, an American Eagle ad featuring Euphoria star Sydney Sweeney and some poorly conceived wordplay has broken everyone's brains.

Last week, the mall brand unveiled a series of ads featuring Sweeney sporting their fall collection. One video shows her filming herself on the floor with a dog; another depicts her fixing the engine of a car. All of them end with a booming, male voice declaring “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans,” with the copy displayed in large font.

The spots that caught the internet's ire are arguably the most provocative, each an obvious riff on Brooke Shields' infamous 1980 Calvin Klein commercial, in which the then-15-year-old actor recites facts about genetics (“certain genes may…fade away,” Shields notes) while posing in the company's denim. The Sweeney ad plays on the same jeans/genes pun, but in a much clumsier fashion and in a very complicated cultural landscape.

“My body's composition is determined by my genes,” Sweeney starts in one video that's since been deleted from American Eagle's social media. The camera starts to zoom in on her chest before she lightly scolds the operator. “Hey, eyes up here.” In another, she says, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color.” The camera pans to Sweeney's eyes, and she says, “My jeans are blue.”

The same pun is used in a poster that reads “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” with the word “genes” crossed out above it. It immediately raised questions about the language of the ad, as well as its blonde-haired, blue-eyed messenger: Are we supposed to want pants or Aryan features?

In its most innocent interpretation, it reads as passe in its use of a “conventionally attractive” spokesmodel. Many, however, have deemed the American Eagle ads a racist dog whistle, some even calling it Nazi propaganda. Meanwhile, voices on the right, including the White House, have celebrated the ads as a middle finger to liberals and “woke.” President Donald Trump has also spoken out in support of her following reports that she's a registered Republican.

The ads are…weird. Why bother buying the jeans if you don't have the genes it celebrates? Plus, Sweeney's role in it, given the partisan nonsense she's been drafted into in the recent past, raises an eyebrow. American Eagle has since clarified its intentions with the ads, stating that the marketing was solely meant to highlight the jeans. “We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way,” read an Instagram statement on August 1. Sweeney has yet to respond.

Regardless, the whole kerfuffle says less about Sweeney herself — or even American Eagle's marketing team — than about the politically fraught state of media in the US.

To comprehend the layers of the controversy, one has to understand the politically charged and paradoxical nature of Sweeney's image and career thus far.

After landing supporting roles in The Handmaid's Tale and Sharp Objects, Sweeney received her big break on the HBO teen drama Euphoria in 2019 as self-destructive teenager Cassie Howard. Her role on the show, which often sees her character nude or wearing cleavage-baring tops, has contributed to much of Euphoria's seedy reputation, while also shaping Sweeney's bombshell image. The show also helped launch her as an aspiring “prestige” actor; her performance earned critical praise, as well as an Emmy nomination in 2022. She earned an additional nomination that year for her role in HBO's The White Lotus.

This acclaim was followed by the release of the 2023 romantic-comedy Anyone But You, which she starred in opposite Glen Powell and co-produced. The Shakespeare adaptation was marketed with PR-orchestrated rumors about Sweeney and Powell's relationship and went on to earn over $200 million globally. By all accounts, it seemed poised to be the next big movie star, with all the makings of a savvy entrepreneur.

Then, around 2024, things started to get strange — and loudly. That year, Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live. The episode featured several jokes about her breasts, and she wore a low-cut dress during “goodnights.” This elicited multiple op-eds from conservative outlets claiming that Sweeney, and her willingness to participate in gags about her own sex appeal, signaled a return to both a pre-MeToo climate and “traditional” beauty standards. In fact, this wasn't the first time Sweeney had been linked to conservative ideology, correctly or incorrectly. In 2022, she sparked outrage for photos she posted from her mother's Western-themed birthday party, which showed relatives wearing MAGA hats and Blue Lives Matter gear in the background. She claimed they were merely ironic costumes, an explanation that failed to quell questions about her political leanings.

It certainly hasn't helped that, in the days since the American Eagle controversy, social media users found Sweeney's name in Florida's voter registration lookup, where she's seemingly listed a Republican. It appears that someone sharing her birthdate and name (including her middle initial; B, for Bernice) registered with the party in June of last year, shortly after it was reported that she purchased a home in Florida Keys. Trump, told of this development, said he loved the ad “now.”

Today, the idea that Sweeney might be an undercover agent for MAGA — and voluntary bait for incels — is somewhere between a conspiracy theory and a meme. (No matter that she has supported progressive causes, like Black Lives Matter, appeared at the GLAAD Awards, and said she believes “that a woman has the right to be able to decide over her body.”) Her endorsement work includes brand deals with the country-inspired HeyDude and personal care company Dr. Squatch. By the time she released a soap supposedly made from her own bathwater with the latter company, her critics seemed exhausted by her whole schtick.

“I think her and her camp probably think that they're playing into [her sexuality] with a wink and a smile and being self-aware about her being consumed as this sex object and that she is in control,” says Garrett Mireles, a New York and Tennessee-based brand strategist and copywriter. “How that's received in the public eye isn't as nuanced.”

Mireles says the fact that Sweeney is an actor cast in other people's work and ideas complicates her ability to control the way her image comes across and who exactly she wants to appeal to.

“Sweeney doesn't get to control the message as much as a musician does,” Mireles says. “Sabrina Carpenter, for example, is able to exert a sense of humor in her sexuality and to be a little bit more overtly tongue-in-cheek.”

The American Eagle ads felt especially trollish because they seemed to hit on both of the accusations looming over Sweeney's career: She's too sexualized, and she's promoting some sort of right-wing agenda. In this case, the right-coded overtones of the ad — heralding a blonde, white woman's genes as the epitome of beauty and “goodness” — hit a lot harder.

Any implication of “good genes,” pun or not, would ring alarms in our political climate. Currently, ICE and the Trump administration have undertaken the most aggressive deportation effort in years, including the gleeful construction of an alligator-surrounded detainment center that has been compared to a concentration camp. When talking about crimes committed by immigrants, Trump has said there are a “lot of bad genes in our country.” Meanwhile, Health Department secretary Robert F. Kennedy has been accused of promoting “soft eugenics” through his proposals to eliminate vaccines and lifesaving health services that would disproportionately impact certain populations.

Outside of politics, pop culture is also feeling a lot more Trump-friendly these days. From country artists dominating the charts from trad-wife content online to celebrities cozying up to the president, it seems like everyone is embracing the reign of MAGA and the tastes of his voter base. This has made every piece of pop culture, from influencers to ad campaigns, fodder for viewing through a MAGA lens. At the same time, the right has made efforts to insert itself into cultural moments and ephemera, from animation memes to superhero-movie discourse. More and more regular people are vigilant about the way pop culture can be used to push political messages. But it can be difficult to know what does and doesn't deserve our energy and cultural attention.

Still, it's hard not to feel like we've all been effectively “got” by a brand that most of us haven't thought about since high school, one that has not sparked this much fervent discussion in its entire existence. But even American Eagle might not have put as much thought into the ads as its critics did. Peter Bray, founder and executive creative director at advertising agency Bray & Co, says the American Eagle ad may be more innocent than we assume, the result of a “first thought” concept as opposed to anything intentionally controversial.

“I don't think in any way this was their intent,” Bray says. “They thought they had a lightbulb moment of creativity and didn't think about the bigger cultural picture.”

Whether or not it meant it, American Eagle illuminated a winning engagement strategy for the second Trump era: Flirt with the public's fear (or excitement) about fascism — with the help of Sydney Sweeney.

Update, August 4, 10:30 am ET: This piece was originally published on August 1 and has been updated with news that Sydney Sweeney appears to be a registered Republican in official databases, as well as Trump's comments about the ad campaign.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Tesla just announced a $29 billion pay package for Elon Musk, saying 'no one matches' the CEO","https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-elon-musk-new-29-billion-pay-package-ceo-2025-8","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 10:32:00 GMT","

Tesla has unveiled a new $29 billion pay package for Elon Musk.

The EV giant's board announced on Monday that it had granted Musk a ""good faith"" CEO performance award of 96 million restricted shares of Tesla stock, worth just over $29 billion based on the stock's current value.

It comes as Musk's 2018 pay package, which was worth about $46.8 billion in June, remains in limbo after being struck down by a Delaware judge last December.

In a letter to shareholders, the Tesla board members Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson said the new package was necessary to ""retain and incentivize"" Musk amid an ""ever-intensifying AI talent war.""

""The war for AI talent is intensifying, with recent months including multi-billion-dollar acquisitions of companies and nine-figure cash compensation packages for non-founder, individual AI engineers,"" Denholm and Wilson-Thompson wrote.

""Even among this group of highly talented individuals, no one matches Elon's remarkable combination of leadership experience, technical expertise, and, arguably most importantly, decades-long proven track record of building the most revolutionary and profitable businesses across different industries,"" they added.

Both Musk and Tesla have fiercely criticized the decision to strike down the 2018 pay package after a shareholder lawsuit, with the billionaire launching an appeal in March.

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing also posted on X, the Tesla board members said the new $29 billion ""CEO Interim Award"" would include a requirement that Musk serve continuously in a senior leadership role at Tesla during the two-year vesting term.

The award is also structured to ""incrementally increase"" Musk's voting rights upon grant. Musk has repeatedly expressed concern about his level of control over Tesla. In January, he said on X that he felt ""uncomfortable"" expanding the EV company's AI and robotics capabilities without having about 25% voting control.

Denholm and Wilson-Thompson wrote that Tesla's board had voted unanimously to award Musk the interim award, with Musk and his brother, Kimbal, recusing themselves.

Tesla shareholders would have a chance to vote on a longer-term CEO compensation strategy at the company's annual shareholder meeting in November, the letter added, and the interim award would be forfeited or returned if Musk's 2018 pay package is reinstated to avoid a ""double dip.""

Investors have expressed concern over Musk's commitment to Tesla in recent months amid Tesla's poor performance and the billionaire's high-profile involvement in US politics.

Tesla's share price is down about 25% this year. The stock is roughly 3% higher in premarket trading following the board's announcement.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","'Hate it!': We spoke to 4 never-AI Gen Zers","https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-people-against-ai-use-2025-8","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 09:59:00 GMT","

Alexis asked her manager to stop using ChatGPT. Delaney sees her eco-conscious friends making exceptions for the technology. Weezy said she tries to make sure none of her friends touch AI.

Much is made of Gen Z being the first ""AI native"" generation. Young people have grown up on AI, using it for everything from homework help to companionship, and thus can bring their skills with it into the workforce.

Many Gen Zers embrace AI — but not every young person is on board.

A McKinsey study earlier this year found that millennials, and not Gen Z, reported the most familiarity and comfort with generative AI. In a recent Slack survey, 30% of millennials said they thoroughly understand AI agents, compared with 22% of Gen Z respondents.

A subsection of Gen Zers has come out fervently against AI. Those young people include both men and women, as evidenced by a multitude of TikTok comments and posts on X, though none of the young men contacted by Business Insider agreed to an interview.

We spoke with four Gen Z women to hear why they've become self-proclaimed AI haters — and the lengths they'll go to avoid the technology.

As a marine biology student, 23-year-old Alexis Rose Young cares deeply about the environment. She said she'd seen AI do ""more harm than good.""

""I personally do really care about the environmental impact with the amount of carbon that AI requires,"" Young said.

Thanks to the AI boom, data centers have led to an incredible demand for power, expanding their carbon footprint. A 2024 Goldman Sachs report indicated that data centers' carbon dioxide emissions could more than double by 2030. A separate 2024 study suggested that carbon emissions for writing and illustrations were lower for AI than their human counterparts.

Young tries her best to eliminate AI from her life. She often uses Google to find companies that have integrated AI into their services so that she can turn the features off. She's found some uses of AI unavoidable, such as when her professor recently asked the class to use Grammarly.

Recently, Young's manager in a customer service job used AI to sketch out what their monthly chalkboard design could look like. She tried to explain her concern.

""I was like, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be unprofessional, and I don't mean to be 'too woke,' because some people don't respond to that,"" Young said. ""I did try to tell her a little bit more.""

Cheyenne Shoemaker used to work in mental healthcare. Now, she sees people recommending ChatGPT over therapy.

""A big part of the benefits of therapy is that therapist-client relationship,"" Shoemaker said. ""Our social skills have already been so affected by the rise of tech.""

Shoemaker was frustrated with humans talking to robots, whether it be makeshift therapists or customer service representatives. Also citing environmental concerns, the 24-year-old said she avoids using any AI in her life, minus a quick glance at Google's AI overviews.

When Shoemaker heard that iOS 18 would include new Apple Intelligence features, she turned off her phone's automatic software updates.

""There's no reason for this,"" Shoemaker said. ""Why would I need AI on my phone?""

Many workplaces have begun requiring that their employees adopt AI tools rapidly to increase productivity. Would Shoemaker take one of those jobs?

""I think that would be a dealbreaker,"" she said. ""Ethically, I wouldn't be able to do that.""

Then Shoemaker caught herself. The app she uses to get dog-walking gigs has an AI tool summarizing the pet's personality.

When asked for her feelings on AI, 27-year-old Weezy Simes had a quick response: ""Hate it! Don't want anything to do with it.""

Simes said AI had been negatively affecting her work. As a florist, her clients will come in with AI-generated floral arrangements made of flowers that don't exist. As an Etsy seller, Simes has also watched AI-generated art and product descriptions flood the platform.

""My sales have been majorly down,"" Simes said. ""I know that some people have been protesting for various reasons, and I don't know if it's because of that, or if it's just because it's flooded with all of these AI-generated print-on-demand items. It's like people won't even want to look there anymore.""

Simes said she believes AI is ""destroying communities, health, and the environment"" and is ""responsible for creating a lot of garbage."" Aside from the in-app integrations where it cannot be avoided, Simes said she'd ""never knowingly used AI.""

Her friends don't use it, either. When ChatGPT first came out, Simes saw one of her roommates using it in place of a search engine.

""I gave her a big talking to,"" Simes said.

Delaney Vetter, 26, has ""ethical and environmental"" concerns about AI.

She remembers when Sam Altman said OpenAI spent ""tens of millions of dollars"" in electricity costs on people saying ""please"" and ""thank you"" to ChatGPT models, and when The New York Times reported that families lost running water access when Meta was building a data center nearby. (A Meta spokeswoman previously told the Times that it was ""unlikely"" the data center affected the supply of groundwater in the area.)

Vetter watches her friends use AI for increasingly simple tasks, such as drafting a grocery shopping list. These friends, she said, are ""environmentally-conscious, ethical, thoughtful people.""

""AI seems to be, in my perspective, the exception to the rule,"" Vetter said.

As a food and beverage publicist, Vetter also doesn't believe that AI helps her work much. Two years ago, a PR group she worked for suggested using AI to write headlines. Vetter was skeptical. When hiring an intern last year, she noticed that many of the cover letters looked like they were written by ChatGPT.

Vetter also said she spoke with one of her employees after noticing many of their email responses were ""so clearly not written by them.""

Today, Vetter doesn't use generative AI at all in her work, she said, though she sometimes finds herself tempted.

On Zoom calls, Vetter often sees her clients using AI notetakers. She sometimes asks herself why she doesn't use one too — but she has her reasons.

""I'm going to be taking notes because then I'm going to remember what we talked about, and then I'm going to send them over, and it's no different than them getting an AI recap,"" Vetter said. ""And, a lot of times, those AI recaps are really wonky.""

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared a screenshot on X on Sunday that appeared to be the much-anticipated GPT-5.

Altman posted a seemingly innocuous comment on X praising the animated sci-fi show ""Pantheon."" The show is a cult favorite in tech circles and tackles themes like artificial general intelligence.

In response, one X user asked if GPT-5 also recommends the show. Altman responded with a screenshot and said, ""turns out yes!""

It is one of the first public glimpses of GPT-5, which is expected to be more powerful than earlier models, feature a larger context window, be able to take on more agentic tasks, and have multimodal capabilities.

According to the screenshot, some things will remain the same, however, like ChatGPT's love of the em dash.

OpenAI is under pressure to unveil a flashy new model as competitors like Google Deepmind, Meta, xAI, and Anthropic continue to nip at its heels.

The screenshot shows that GPT-5 is capable, at the very least, of accurately synthesizing information from the internet. The bot said Pantheon has a ""100% critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes"" and is ""cerebral, emotional, and philosophically intense.""

Business Insider confirmed that it does have a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Reviews of the show on the site use similar language. One review described it as ""gripping, cerebral, remarkably high-concept."" Another called it ""a portrait of a rapidly changing world that takes care to document the emotional carnage left in its wake.""

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shun Sagara, a venture capitalist who moved from Tokyo to Bengaluru with his family in 2023. It has been edited for length and clarity.

I grew up in Japan and began my career at an enterprise software company in Tokyo. I spent five years at the company in various sales roles before I left in 2018. The following year, I joined my current venture capital firm, Genesia Ventures, and worked as an investment manager.

In my second year at the firm, there was serious interest in international expansion. We had a presence in Southeast Asia, and there was a growing consensus that India was our next logical destination. It aligned perfectly with my ambition to work in a fast-paced market, and I was keen to make a move.

My move to India wasn't driven by a fascination with curry or Bollywood or anything like that. I always felt like India and Japan shine on the sidelines but don't claim the center stage the way China or the US do. The trigger moment for me was when a Japanese founder told me I was the only VC among 20 to 30 meetings she had taken who truly understood enterprise businesses. It was flattering but rang alarm bells — if there was no competition around me, then maybe I was playing in the wrong league. Moving to India, where startups are not just building products, but are building the infrastructure of a rising economic power, felt like the next best step for me.

Moving with family wasn't an easy decision. My wife was a flight attendant for Japanese Airlines and had been exposed to New Delhi, the capital, before. She didn't like the air quality, the spicy food, and how it wasn't safe for young single women. I had to convince her that Bengaluru was different from Delhi. Once she was on board, we moved to Bengaluru in the summer of 2023 so I could launch an India subsidiary for my VC firm.

I'm the company's only employee in the country, and I'm tasked with making India investments for our Japan-based fund. Our average first check size is around $500,000, and we top it up with $1 million to $1.5 million investments.

My investment thesis is based on these three qualities rather than specific sectors: founders who understand the Indian context well; areas such as pharmaceuticals or precision manufacturing where Indian companies can become global market leaders; and areas where there is opportunity for India-Japan collaborations, like elder care or workforce shortage problems. Since launching our India office, I have invested in five companies.

There are big differences in how business is done. For example, Japanese culture is built around risk mitigation, while the Indian startup ecosystem is not. In Japan, our startup pitch decks have 40-50 slides and address every single objection a VC may have. In India, founders walk into meetings with a napkin sketch and unshakeable conviction. Both approaches work from my experience.

Another key difference is India's ""jugaad"" mentality, which is all about improvising with what you have, versus the Japanese ""kaizen,"" which involves continuous optimization of existing processes. I've found that combining these mindsets in India-Japanese deals can produce extraordinary results.

Coming from Japan, cleanliness is one of the biggest differences about living in India, and it is also one thing my wife and children find challenging.

But when it comes to raising children, India, and in particular Bengaluru, is one of the best cities in the world. People are warm and kind toward foreigners, and most people love children. My two little kids — a five-year-old daughter and a three-year-old son — are well-treated by local people. There are also great international schools in the city, and raising children has been a great experience for my wife and me.

What surprised me most was the grassroots popularity of sports. I always knew that India was a cricket-loving country, but I was shocked to see how popular soccer is getting in the country. Two years into living here, I have a weekly soccer game with five friends. While I know lots of Japanese expats and other foreigners, 90% of my circle is local Indians.

The people I work with are collaborative and open-minded, and they have always been helpful when I encounter daily operational challenges.

My commitment to living in India is long term, and I don't plan to come back to Japan in the next five years at least. Even if I move back home after 10 years, I want to continue to be exposed to India and Indian businesses. Bridging India and Japan is the goal of my entire life and career.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I opened a restaurant with my grandma's recipes. I work 12-hour days and struggled to make rent, but I don't regret it.","https://www.businessinsider.com/refused-to-work-office-job-started-stall-using-grandma-recipes-2025-7","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 00:18:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ernest Ang, the 24-year-old founder of Kokoyo Nyonya Delights, a Peranakan eatery in Singapore. It has been edited for length and clarity.

When I was younger, I wasn't allowed in the kitchen alone. My family always feared I'd burn it down.

So when I told my grandmother that I wanted to start my own restaurant, she thought it was just another one of my crazy ideas — I'd had many growing up.

I've always loved my grandmother's food. She used to run a hawker stall selling Peranakan food.

Peranakan people like me have mixed Chinese and Malay ancestry, so our food is a fusion of Malay, Chinese, and Indian flavors. It's very strong in flavor and very fragrant.

Last year, I started my own Peranakan food business, battling high rents, difficulty getting customers, and getting used to sweating in a kitchen for hours. I never looked back.

I did an electronics engineering diploma but realized I hated the idea of being an engineer. I didn't know what job to pursue, but I knew what I didn't want to do — engineering.

I tried looking for work in human resources and administrative roles, but I knew that wasn't what I was cut out for.

My friends recommended I try something different because my grandma is a good cook, and I love to cook.

I decided to take a stab at it.

My grandma is very secretive about her recipes. To her, they're like an asset.

When I told her that I wanted to start my own restaurant, she thought I wasn't committed to it and that I would give up after a month or two.

For months, I went to her house with ingredients, trying to watch how she cooked and take notes. This was a challenging process because she measured ingredients based on gut feeling.

I finally managed to figure out her recipes and develop a process for cooking for a restaurant.

I launched Kokoyo Nyonya Delights in August, after months of practising recipes and an investment of 80,000 Singapore dollars, or about $62,000. I rented a small open-air eatery in Singapore's northwestern Serangoon neighborhood for SG$13,500 a month.

Three of my friends helped me out with cooking and operations.

My grandmother contributed some of her savings. I couldn't have done it without her investment.

I started with 12 items on the menu, which included soups, vegetable dishes, and some meat dishes.

My grandmother told me to focus on the most popular Peranakan dishes, like inchi kabin, a fried chicken dish, and beef rendang, which is beef stewed in coconut milk and spices. Babi pongteh, which is braised pork in soybean sauce, is also one of our favorites.

Everything served at Kokoyo Nyonya has to be vetted by my grandmother. I'm not a certified chef. I don't have a culinary background — I only have my grandma.

Cooking Peranakan food is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. I get in at around 9 a.m. every day to make everything from scratch, because grandma doesn't like me selling leftovers. I leave after 9 p.m. after feeding the dinner crowd.

There's a lot of prep involved. Based on my grandma's recipe, just cooking our rice is a 23-step, three-hour-long process.

While the first few weeks of operations were smooth, the real challenge came after we had an article written about us, and we started seeing a wave of customers.

The crowd was overwhelming, and I realized we couldn't cope with it. That's when I had to abandon some of the things my grandma told me to do, like ditching a wok in favor of a deep fryer to fry chicken.

But less than a year after I opened in Serangoon, I had to move. My rent was also too high: SG$13,500 monthly. I couldn't afford it.

And there were a lot of older people in the neighborhood where I opened my restaurant. I found that they weren't too willing to spend a lot of money on food.

In July, I moved to a smaller stall in a food court near Singapore's Sixth Avenue, a wealthy neighborhood where people are willing to spend more.

Rent here is much cheaper. I pay exactly half of what I did in my earlier location. I've also reduced the number of staff members from four to two.

At first, I wasn't used to the long days in the kitchen. I was sweaty and grumpy.

But I later accepted that that's what life as a restaurant owner is like. I work seven days a week, which doesn't leave time for much else. I haven't met my friends in a while, unless they come to see me.

But I like that it's not a repetitive job. Every day comes with a new problem, be it difficult customers or problems with staff.

I don't have regrets about trying to start something of my own.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Ukraine says it stole intel from the Russian Navy and found weak points in its newest nuclear missile submarine","https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-found-weak-points-in-new-russian-nuclear-missile-submarine-2025-8","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 14:02:00 GMT","

Ukraine said that it stole troves of classified information on Russia's newest nuclear missile submarine during a recent operation, including data that points to the vessel's vulnerabilities.

Specialists working for Ukraine's military intelligence agency, the HUR, breached the Russian Navy and obtained internal documents concerning the new Project 955A Borei-class submarine Knyaz Pozharsky, which entered service less than two weeks ago.

The HUR specialists got their hands on a list of the submarine's crew, including information about positions, fitness levels, and combat instructions, as well as data regarding the boat's layout, such as diagrams of its survivability systems, the intelligence agency said in a statement over the weekend.

The HUR published several documents that appeared to have been obtained from the breach. It said that its intelligence agents also obtained access to the crew regulations, instructions for transferring wounded sailors and cargo, engineering documents, towing procedures, and details about the submarine's schedule.

Business Insider was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the documents. Russia's defense ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the theft.

The Ukrainian intel operation could be a setback for the Russian Navy and expose vulnerabilities within its Project 955A-class submarines, a key element of Moscow's nuclear triad — alongside its arsenal of ground- and air-launched missiles — and considered to be among its most advanced submarines.

""The information obtained by the intelligence allows identifying the features and technical limitations not only of the 'Knyaz Pozharsky' but also of other submarines of Project 955A, critically important for maintaining the imperial myth of the aggressor state Russia,"" the HUR wrote in a Telegram post on Sunday.

Russia operates one of the largest submarine fleets in the world, with an estimated 64 active vessels. Among them are five of the improved Project 955A ""Borei-A"" class variants. These stealthy, nuclear-powered boats are 170 meters long and can travel at speeds of 29 knots, or 33 mph, when submerged. Each of the Project 955A vessels, like Knyaz Pozharskiy, can carry 16 RSM-56 Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) equipped with nuclear warheads.

The strategic RSM-56 is a three-stage solid propellant intercontinental ballistic missile that's been in service since 2013. The missile has an estimated range of over 8,000 kilometers and can carry up to 10 independently targetable warheads, each carrying about 100-150 kilotons of nuclear material. The submarines can also carry a dozen torpedoes.

Construction of the new Knyaz Pozharskiy began in 2016, and the vessel was commissioned into service just recently on July 24 at a ceremony attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin. It joined the 31st submarine division of Russia's Northern Fleet, based in Gadzhievo, in the Murmansk region.

Russian submarine and underwater activity, especially in the Arctic region, has increasingly become a focus for NATO. Just last week, for instance, the military alliance announced the deployment of a maritime task force to operate in the High North region amid efforts to increase its presence there.

In this article

Tesla CEO Elon Musk was awarded an interim pay package of 96 million shares of the company over the weekend. The shares would be worth about $29 billion.

Tesla stock climbed about 2% Monday.

The company said in a filing Sunday that the pay package would vest in two years as long as Musk continued as CEO or in another key executive position.

The new award would be forfeited if the legal battle over his 2018 compensation ends with Musk being able to exercise the larger pay package, which was valued at $56 billion.

In January, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick upheld a prior ruling in the case, Tornetta v. Musk, that the compensation plan was improperly granted. Tesla shareholders approved the pay package in June 2024.

The case is now before the Delaware Supreme Court.

Musk's 2018 pay package included a set of performance targets for the company, which were all achieved.

The judge called it ""the largest potential compensation opportunity ever observed in public markets"" in her January decision and said it was 33 times higher than the nearest comparison, which was Musk's prior compensation package.

The pay announcement comes following a weak earnings report from the EV maker in which Tesla missed on the top and bottom lines, with sales falling for a second straight quarter and automotive revenue dropping 16%.

Musk acknowledged the looming loss of EV tax credits on a call with analysts following the report.

""We probably could have a few rough quarters. I am not saying that we will, but we could,"" Musk said.

The company has another shareholder meeting in November.

Joby Aviation will acquire helicopter ride-share company Blade Air Mobility's passenger business for up to $125 million, Joby said Monday, as it works to speed the deployment of electric air taxis for commercial passenger services.

Blade's medical organ transplant division is not part of the deal and will remain a separate public company rebranded as Strata Critical Medical, but will partner with Joby on medical transportation.

Joby is working to win Federal Aviation Administration certification of its electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or eVTOLs.

Joby CEO JoeBen Bevirt said the company is on track to begin FAA Type Inspection flight testing early next year, a key step before it can begin commercial service.

Bevirt told Reuters the deal gives Joby existing customers, takeoff and landing locations and a decade of operating experience, which is a ""launchpad, a catalyst to really grow the experience"" that Blade has built. ""We think that clean, quiet aircraft are going to unlock large numbers of new takeoff and landing locations,"" Bevirt said.

Blade flew more than 50,000 passengers in 2024 from 12 urban terminals including JFK Airport in New York and Newark Liberty Airport and several Manhattan locations. Blade passenger operations will continue and be led by Blade CEO Rob Wiesenthal as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Joby.

""We fly more people by helicopter - vertical transportation - than any other company in the world. So with the combination of the infrastructure, the flyers, the routes, a globally recognized brand, it really is to the customer... more of an asset swap,"" Wiesenthal said in an interview.

Wiesenthal added there will be a transition phase where the combined company will operate helicopters and Joby aircraft. At some point over time, it will transition to operating only Joby electric air taxis.

The acquisition includes all of Blade's passenger business, including U.S. and European operations. Under the agreement, Joby will pay Blade up to $125 million, including $35 million tied to certain performance milestones and retention of certain key employees.

In this article

Baidu will bring its driverless taxis to Europe next year via a partnership with U.S. ridehailing firm Lyft, as the Chinese tech giant looks to expand its autonomous vehicles globally.

The robotaxis will initially be deployed in the U.K. and Germany from 2026 with the aim to have ""thousands"" of vehicles across Europe in the ""following years,"" the two companies said.

Lyft has had very little presence in Europe until last week when it closed the acquisition of Germany-based ride hailing company FreeNow, which is available in over 150 cities across nine countries, including Ireland, the U.K., Germany and France.

Deployment of the autonomous cars is ""pending regulatory approval,"" Lyft and Baidu said in a Monday statement. It's unclear if Lyft will offer Baidu's robotaxis via the FreeNow app or another product.

The partnership marks a continued push from Baidu to expand its robotaxis to international markets.

Last month, Baidu partnered with Uber to deploy its autonomous cars on the ride-hailing giant's platform outside the U.S. and mainland China, with a focus on the Middle East and Asia, which will launch later this year. The partnership also covers Europe, though a launch date for the region has not yet been disclosed.

In China, Baidu has been operating its own robotaxi service since 2021 in major cities like Beijing, allowing users to hail an Apollo Go car through the app. Meanwhile, for Lyft, the deal could boost the firm's presence in the region as it looks to take on rivals like Uber and Bolt.

Autonomous vehicles have become a big focus for ride-hailing companies which have looked to partner with companies that are developing the technology for driverless cars.

In the U.K., a market that Lyft is targeting, Uber this year partnered with self-driving car technology firm Wayve to launch trials of fully autonomous rides starting in spring 2026.

In this article

Fiber-optic cable maker Amphenol said on Monday it will buy CommScope's connectivity and cable solutions business for $10.5 billion, broadening its broadband portfolio and network infrastructure.

Shares of CommScope surged 42% in premarket trading, while Amphenol rose about 2%.

The all-cash transaction is aimed at diversifying Amphenol's industrial interconnect products, particularly in the building infrastructure connectivity market.

It is the largest acquisition for Connecticut-based Amphenol and will boost its market share and capitalize on surging broadband and 5G demand, while positioning the company at the forefront of the rapidly evolving connectivity landscape.

For CommScope, the sale is a significant step in its strategy to streamline operations and shore up its balance sheet.

The unit that CommScope is selling designs, manufactures, and supports cabling and connectivity products for various network types, including broadband, enterprise and wireless networks.

Earlier this year, Amphenol bought CommScope's Andrew business. The latest deal also follows last year's $2.1 billion purchase of CommScope's outdoor wireless network and distributed antenna systems businesses.

The U.S. network infrastructure provider reported a debt load of $9.4 billion as of December and has been pursuing asset sales as part of a comprehensive debt reduction plan.

Following the completion of the divestiture, CommScope will retain its access network solutions business and part of its networking and security services.

The U.S.-listed company is navigating the legacy of aggressive acquisitions and the economic turbulence brought about by the global pandemic, which temporarily slowed its expansion plans.

CommScope's decision to sell its CCS division is a calculated effort to bolster its balance sheet, reinforcing its commitment to financial prudence and strategic agility in the competitive network infrastructure sector.

The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026 and will add to Amphenol's diluted earnings per share in first full year after closing.

The Wall Street Journal first reported that they are nearing a deal.

In this article

Amazon is laying off roughly 110 employees in its Wondery podcast division and the head of the group is leaving as part of a broader reshuffling of the company's audio unit.

In a Monday note to staffers, Steve Boom, Amazon's vice president of audio, Twitch and games, said the company is consolidating some Wondery units under its Audible audiobook and podcasting division. Wondery CEO Jen Sargent is also stepping down from her role, Boom said.

""These changes will not only better align our teams as they work to take advantage of the strategic opportunities ahead but, even more crucially, will ensure we have the right structure in place to deliver the very best experience to creators, customers and advertisers,"" Boom wrote in the memo, which was viewed by CNBC. ""Unfortunately, these changes also include some role reductions, and we have notified those employees this morning.""

Bloomberg was first to report on the job cuts.

The move comes nearly five years after Amazon acquired Wondery as part of a push to expand its catalog of original audio content. The podcasting company made a name for itself with hit shows like ""Dirty John"" and ""Dr. Death.""

More recently, Wondery signed several lucrative licensing deals with Jason and Travis Kelce's ""New Heights"" podcast, along with Dax Shepard's ""Armchair Expert.""

Amazon is streamlining ""how Wondery further integrates"" into the company by separating the teams that oversee its narrative podcasts from those developing ""creator-led shows,"" Boom wrote.

The narrative podcasting unit will consolidate under Audible, and creator-led content will move to a new unit within Boom's organization in Amazon called ""creator services,"" he wrote.

Amazon's audio pursuits face a heightened challenge from the growing popularity of video podcasts on Alphabet's YouTube, which now hosts an increasing number of shows.

Video shows require different discovery, growth and monetization strategies than ""audio-first, narrative series,"" Boom wrote in the memo to Amazon staffers.

""The podcast landscape has evolved significantly over the past few years,"" Boom said.

In this article

Harley-Davidson said on Monday Topgolf's Arthur Starrs would succeed Jochen Zeitz as CEO, to help steer the storied motorcycle maker through U.S. tariffs and slowing demand for its cruiser bikes.

Starrs, currently the CEO of sports entertainment company Topgolf International, is taking the reins at Harley as the sector faces cost pressures on imported parts and components due to U.S. President Donald Trump's broad tariffs.

Demand for leisure vehicles has been on a decline in the United States, with consumers rethinking non-essential purchases in an uncertain economy.

Harley has also struggled to win over younger riders, who prefer more fuel-efficient models with modern safety aids.

Earlier this year, activist investor H Partners proposed the removal of three Harley directors, including CEO Zeitz, criticizing the company for declining sales and a falling stock price. Harley had defeated the proposal through a shareholder vote.

Zeitz will remain on as a senior adviser through February 2026. The company had announced in April he planned to step down from the role later this year.

Shares of Harley rose more than 1% in early trading.

Starrs, who will start at the top role later this year, previously held leadership roles at Pizza Hut and Topgolf, a unit of Topgolf Callaway Brands.

Zeitz spent half a decade at Harley and launched its ""Hardwire"" strategy in 2021, aimed at reviving the brand and connecting with young riders, as its core ""baby boomer"" customer base aged.

Last week, the company said it would sell loans worth over $5 billion to KKR & Co and PIMCO, in an attempt to reduce its debt pile while retaining majority ownership over its financial arm.

In this article

Tesla CEO Elon Musk was awarded an interim pay package of 96 million shares of the company over the weekend. The shares would be worth about $29 billion.

Tesla stock climbed about 2% Monday.

The company said in a filing Sunday that the pay package would vest in two years as long as Musk continued as CEO or in another key executive position.

The new award would be forfeited if the legal battle over his 2018 compensation ends with Musk being able to exercise the larger pay package, which was valued at $56 billion.

In January, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick upheld a prior ruling in the case, Tornetta v. Musk, that the compensation plan was improperly granted. Tesla shareholders approved the pay package in June 2024.

The case is now before the Delaware Supreme Court.

Musk's 2018 pay package included a set of performance targets for the company, which were all achieved.

The judge called it ""the largest potential compensation opportunity ever observed in public markets"" in her January decision and said it was 33 times higher than the nearest comparison, which was Musk's prior compensation package.

 BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF will get a boost from the SEC's decision to raise the limit for options contracts 10-fold, NYDIG's Greg Cipolaro said. 

BlackRock's market-dominating spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund may get bigger after the US Securities and Exchange Commission increased position limits for many Bitcoin funds, according to crypto financial services firm NYDIG.

The SEC on Tuesday increased the number of allowed options contracts from 25,000 to 250,000 “for all ETFs with options,” which includes the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) but not the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), NYDIG's global head of research, Greg Cipolaro, said in a report on Friday.

“The change is likely to widen the monstrous lead that IBIT already has over the other players, while it hobbles FBTC's position as the second-largest options player,” Cipolaro said.

IBIT has $85.5 billion in assets under management, four times as much as FBTC, the second-largest Bitcoin (BTC) ETF by assets with $21.35 billion, according to CoinGlass.

Cipolaro said the SEC's decision to raise options position limits on Bitcoin ETFs would likely suppress Bitcoin's volatility and lead to more spot demand.

“This change enables more aggressive implementation of options strategies, like covered call selling,” he said, where traders sell a call option while owning the underlying asset, which limits downside risk but also the amount gained from the trade.

Cipolaro added that less volatility makes Bitcoin “appealing on a risk-parity basis, potentially drawing in new capital” from institutional portfolios looking for exposure to balanced risks.

“The feedback loop of falling volatility leading to increased spot buying could become a powerful driver of sustained demand,” he said.

The SEC went ahead with a slew of various ETF-related regulatory approvals on Tuesday, most notably approving in-kind creation and redemption on crypto ETFs, allowing the exchange of shares for the underlying crypto instead of cash.

Cipolaro said this was a “key feature” ETF issuers had wanted before their products were approved, and now that it is, it will “have important impacts on market structure and investor access.”

He added that Authorized Participants (APs) — financial institutions that manage the creation and redemption of ETF shares — which don't have crypto capabilities “will likely not be able to take advantage of arbitrage activities and offer competitive pricing.”

“There are only two APs today, Jane Street and Virtu, that also have corresponding crypto entities that can trade both sides of the trade,” Cipolaro said, “We expect broker-dealers (APs) that don't have crypto capabilities to acquire or partner to keep up.”

 Senior Contributor. 

Bitcoin and crypto prices have swung wildly over the last week after a $300 billion sell-off sparked fears of a crypto crash.

The bitcoin price has lost almost 10% since hitting an all-time high of $123,000 per bitcoin, with analysts speculating a bitcoin price game-changer could have already quietly happened.

Now, as fears swirl around the future of the U.S. dollar, Wall Street giant BlackRock could be poised to extend its huge bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) lead over its rivals.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week authorized the use of in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms for bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

The long-awaited move is part of the SEC's overhaul of former chair Gary Gensler's preference for crypto exchange-traded products to be cash only, which was perceived to be a barrier to efficiency for institutional market makers.

“It's a new day at the SEC, and a key priority of my chairmanship is developing a fit-for-purpose regulatory framework for crypto asset markets,” SEC chair Paul Atkins said in a statement.

“The biggest takeaway is symbolic. It means there is a new sheriff in town,” Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told the financial newswire. ""Gensler's SEC did not want this to happen. This is the first of what will be several steps toward a more pro-crypto SEC.”

BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager which runs the dominant spot bitcoin ETF with $85 billion in assets under management, filed a request in January to allow in-kind transactions. Others, including Fidelity, which runs the second-largest bitcoin fund with $23 billion in assets under management, followed suit.

BlackRock, which manages around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street's campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024 that now hold almost 1.5 million bitcoin worth $170 billion.

BlackRock's fund alone holds 3.5% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth almost $85 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network.

Alongside the authorization of in-kind crypto ETFs, the SEC has also approved a Nasdaq proposal to increase a position limit for options on BlackRock's IBIT to 250,000 contracts, up from 25,000, expected to ""help bring in bigger institutions and be helpful during volatility,” Balchunas posted to X.

While BlackRock's bitcoin fund is expected to benefit from the change, the second-largest bitcoin fund, run by Fidelity, could see its market share shrink, according to NYDIG's global head of research Greg Cipolaro.

“The change is likely to widen the monstrous lead that IBIT already has over the other players, while it hobbles [Fidelity's] position as the second-largest options player,” Cipolaro wrote in a report.

“As volatility declines, [bitcoin] becomes more investable for institutional portfolios seeking balanced risk exposure. This dynamic could reinforce spot demand. With risk-parity pioneer Ray Dalio recently advocating for a 15% portfolio allocation to gold and crypto in the face of ballooning government debt, the feedback loop of falling volatility leading to increased spot buying could become a powerful driver of sustained demand.”

Last week, legendary billionaire Ray Dalio set markets alight when he recommended a 15% bitcoin or gold portfolio allocation, warning the Federal Reserve has been caught up in debt “doom loop"" and that the dollar is past the “point of no return.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

 Ether “mega whales” continued buying the cryptocurrency, which dipped and began recovering over the weekend. 

Ether whales continued to buy the cryptocurrency in droves, according to onchain analysts, as ETH recovers from a weekend dip. 

“Somebody is buying a ton of ETH,” blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence said on Sunday, with one address accumulating $300 million worth of Ether (ETH) from over-the-counter (OTC) trading at Galaxy Digital.

The whale address currently holds 79,461 ETH, worth around $282.5 million. 

BlackRock has also been loading up on ETH, with the firm's iShares Ethereum Trust ETF seeing $1.7 billion in inflows over the past 10 consecutive trading days.

Onchain holdings of Ether in exchange-traded funds have gone vertical over the past month, surging by more than 40% over the past 30 days, according to Dune Analytics.

The Ether “mega whale” address count has also surged over the past 30 days, according to Glassnode. 

The mega whale cohort is defined by addresses holding more than 10,000 ETH, with more than 200 added since the beginning of July. 

These whale address counts include those held by exchanges, large custodians and exchange-traded products, which have been aggressively accumulating. 

Ether prices cooled off over the weekend with a dip below $3,400, but showed signs of recovery on Monday by reclaiming $3,560.

“While the labor market's cooling trend initially spooked investors, the heightened likelihood of monetary easing could soon reverse the sell-off, offering crypto a bullish tailwind as liquidity expectations shift,” director of strategic partnerships at the CoinW exchange, Monika Mlodzianowska, told Cointelegraph. 

Similar to Bitcoin, which has been bearish in eight out of the past 12 months of August, Ether has seen losses over the past three years in August.

The asset fell by double digits in August 2023 and 2024, but surged a whopping 35.6% during August 2021, which was a bull market year, according to CoinGlass. 

Over the weekend, Eric Trump, the son of US President Donald Trump, told his X followers to buy the ETH dip.

Meanwhile, CNBC labelled Ethereum “Wall Street's invisible backbone” in an article on Saturday.

It's thus a way to potentially port a lot of talent from Ethereum to XRP.

10 stocks we like better than XRP ›

XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) have always been very different beasts. One is a payments chain with compliance baked into its DNA; the other is the original smart contract workhorse. Yet in late June, XRP gained access to a pool of one of Ethereum's most valuable resources -- its large population of developers.

Let's explore why that crossover could send XRP's long-term growth prospects into overdrive.

For years, one key issue was that any developer who wanted to make smart contracts or decentralized apps (dApps) on XRP's chain would need to learn a different technology stack.

But, with the latest update to the XRP Ledger (XRPL), Ripple, the company that issues XRP, answered this issue with the launch of its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain. It went live on the mainnet on June 30, delivering full Ethereum-compatible smart contract support to the XRP universe.

Out of the box, the sidechain lets coders deploy smart contracts on XRP with the same toolkit they use on Ethereum. That means that porting an existing decentralized exchange (DEX) or lending protocol to XRP is almost a copy-and-paste job. In such a situation, XRP itself serves as the native gas token to pay user fees, while a bridge protocol ferries assets between the sidechain and XRPL's main net, so the existing liquidity on the chain stays reachable.

This solution is ingenious because it preserves XRPL's ultra-cheap, near-instant payment rails and compliance features, while insulating the core network from the heavier computation and potential exploits that come with generalized smart contracts. It also makes siphoning skilled smart contract developers from Ethereum extremely easy. So getting at least some of them to contribute to the XRP ecosystem instead of Ethereum is practically a given, especially if more capital is made available for their purposes.

Still, no rose is without thorns.

Bridges remain a favorite attack vector for hackers, and fragmenting liquidity across a sidechain can dull network effects if users refuse to hop over or if the friction of transiting capital from the main net to the sidechain or vice versa is too burdensome.

The beneficial effect of XRP gaining access to Ethereum's developer community is hard to overstate. This is an enabler for XRP's ecosystem to grow over time, sending the chain's value skyward along the way.

Numbers tell the story. As of late July, the Ethereum ecosystem boasted about 5,866 monthly active developers. In contrast, XRPL's community sat near 2,800 active contributors as of June.

Assuming a modest 5% of Ethereum's builders decide that porting to XRPL EVM is worth a weekend hackathon to set up a new project, that's roughly 293 fresh minds working on the chain, or a significant 10% bump to XRPL's current monthly developer base. At least some of them will come back and build something again in the future, especially if there's another round of grants issued by Ripple that encourage them to do so. More realistically, if the sidechain matures and eventually captures 10% to 15% of Ethereum's developers, XRP could expand its builder cohort without spending a dime on recruitment.

Why does that matter for investors? Developer activity correlates strongly with network value creation. More developers on the chain mean more apps, more users, more transaction fees, more innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, and ultimately more demand for the native token used to pay those fees.

There's also a competitive twist here. Every engineer tinkering on XRPL's EVM is one less full-time builder working on projects that would run on Ethereum. While Ethereum certainly enjoys tremendous inertia as well as deep liquidity, developers are famously pragmatic, chasing lower fees, easier onboarding, and fresh user bases. XRPL can now offer all three.

None of this guarantees that XRP will go to the moon, of course. Ethereum is hardly standing still, and it's the single most popular destination for developers for more than one reason.

Yet the upside here is hard to ignore. XRP currently trades at about 40% of Ethereum's market cap, but it just unlocked access to the same talent reservoir. If even a sliver of that talent shifts, the ecosystem's growth curve could steepen sharply, providing a fresh fundamental pillar for long-term bullish theses.

For investors, the launch doesn't rewrite XRP's risk profile overnight, but it meaningfully improves its upside-to-risk ratio. Long-term holders now have a new catalyst to watch in the form of developer traction, while prospective buyers have a new and quantifiable reason to start nibbling.

Ethereum turns 10 as Andrew Keys lays out why he believes it's the backbone of a new financial internet, and why Wall Street still doesn't get it.

Ethereum (ETH-USD) just marked its 10th birthday, and Andrew Keys believes the next decade could be even more transformative. Speaking to Fortune, the chairman of Ether Machine shared why he sees Ethereum as the foundational commodity of the internet, not just another cryptocurrency, and why Wall Street still doesn't fully understand what it's looking at.





Ethereum's critics often point to its changing supply and question whether it can be taken seriously as a monetary asset. Keys disagrees completely. He pushed back on the idea that Ethereum lacks monetary clarity, arguing that its design is intentionally adaptive. Unlike fixed-supply assets, Ethereum adjusts its issuance based on network usage. When activity increases, more ETH is burned through transaction fees. When usage slows, issuance resumes. This system aligns Ethereum's supply with real-time demand rather than following a rigid inflation schedule.

Keys sees that flexibility as Ethereum's core strength. In his view, ETH isn't trying to be digital gold. It's trying to be the fuel that powers a decentralized internet.

Keys has been in the Ethereum ecosystem since its earliest days. He first encountered the project while sweating through a Manhattan summer in a tiny walk-up apartment. Ten years later, he's leading a $1.5 billion SPAC through Ether Machine, a firm designed to invest in and support Ethereum-native infrastructure and companies.

Keys says the institutional world is finally waking up. The U.S. has cleared spot ETH ETFs. Regulated custody providers are on standby. Stablecoin laws like the recently passed “Genius Act” are paving the way for banks and fintechs to build on Ethereum without regulatory guesswork.

Despite the progress, Keys says Wall Street continues to misunderstand what Ethereum actually does. Many still view it as a tech stock proxy or a Bitcoin alternative. In his view, ETH is neither. It's a commodity, but one designed for usage, not scarcity.

He says what makes Ethereum different is that it's not just a ledger. It's a programmable layer for money and applications, with real revenue from gas fees and actual throughput that can scale globally. That kind of infrastructure, he argues, will power stablecoins, tokenized assets, identity protocols, and entire financial rails.

Keys also made it clear he doesn't own any Bitcoin. It's not personal, he just doesn't see it playing the same role in the future of finance. Bitcoin may still have its place as a store of value, but for Keys, Ethereum is where the action is. It's where innovation lives, where developers build, and where institutions are now seriously deploying capital.

While Ethereum is often compared to platforms like Google (GOOGL), Keys believes the analogy doesn't go far enough. Ethereum isn't like Google because it doesn't just help you find or organize information. Instead, Ethereum lets code, ownership, and transactions all happen out in the open, where anyone can verify and build on them.

At the time of writing, ETH is sitting at $3,556.59.

Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) said its ether holdings have climbed to about 833,000 tokens currently worth more than $2.9 billion, making the Tom Lee–backed company the world's largest public holder of ETH as of Aug. 4.

Miller Value Partners founder Bill Miller III has also joined Peter Thiel-backed Founder's Fund and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest among BitMine's roster of top investors,  according to a press release. ARK Invest has bought roughly $52.3 million of BMNR shares since July 29, while Peter Thiel-backed entities acquired a 9.1% BitMine stake last month.

Monday's disclosure comes less than two weeks after BitMine announced a $1 billion stock-repurchase program and reported holdings of 625,000 ETH. Since launching its treasury strategy in early June, the firm has issued equity and convertibles at a rapid clip, moving from an initial $250 million PIPE to nearly $3 billion in ether in about 35 days.

Several U.S. publicly traded entities have tapped capital markets to finance crypto acquisitions, a path popularized by Michael Saylor and Strategy. BitMine's latest announcement suggests it bought 208,000 ETH valued at $739 million today. The massive accumulation pushes the aggregate value of public-company ETH treasuries to well over $10 billion.

BitMine's updated figure surpasses SharpLink Gaming's 480,000 ETH holdings and The Ether Machine's 345,000 ETH stack, cementing BitMine's lead in a fast-growing corporate treasury niche.  The company said it intends to continue raising capital to expand its ETH position and reiterated plans of securing up to 5% of Ethereum supply, a goal titled the “alchemy of 5%” by chairman Tom Lee. Miller also hinted that BitMine aims to stake its ETH balance sheet to generate yield and accrue extra shareholder value.

Bitcoin and major altcoins are recovering from a notable macro-led decline that took place last week, as investors cautiously re-enter the market.

According to The Block's crypto price page, bitcoin rose 1.22% in the past 24 hours to $114,738 as of 10:40 p.m. on Sunday. The world's largest cryptocurrency recently experienced a significant price drop from around $119,000 on July 31 to a low of $111,800 on Saturday. 

Major altcoins showed similar price fluctuations while posting varying gains on Sunday. Ether rose 3.12% to $3,549, XRP gained 6.32% to $3 and Solana added 1.66% to $163.69.

""The recent market dip appears to have been triggered by a broader risk-off sentiment following the disappointing July U.S. nonfarm payrolls report,"" said Presto Research Analyst Min Jung. The report showed that the U.S. added just 73,000 jobs in July, which is far lower than expected.

Jung also said that the weaker-than-expected data, coupled with declines across the U.S. stock market, likely contributed to profit-taking across crypto, especially after several weeks of rallying.

Following last week's macro data-induced decline, analysts said that investors and institutions swiftly moved to ""buy the dip.""

""Whenever there's a dip, it doesn't last very long as buyers come in very quickly to take advantage of the opportunity … It's clear that long term investors and institutions are the ones doing this,"" said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. ""With the recent flurry of crypto treasury companies buying assets and TradFi institutions rolling out crypto services and partnerships, we expect bitcoin's monthly closes to get higher and higher going forward.""

While macro uncertainty and institutional-led bullish sentiment clash, traders are currently ""cautiously optimistic,"" said Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu. 

""The Fear and Greed Index is tilting towards greed, showing improving sentiment,"" Liu said. ""Traders are leaning back into risk, supported by whale buying and hopes for eventual rate cuts.""

Liu said investors now look to the upcoming July consumer price index (CPI) release on Aug. 12, which is a key inflation indicator that would likely affect the next interest rate decision. 

The U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at its last FOMC meeting on July 29 and 30. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that the September rate cut may not be as likely as highly anticipated, with the rate decision depending on macroeconomic data. 

Nonetheless, the CME Group's FedWatch Tool indicates a 80.8% probability of a 0.25% decrease to 4.00-4.25% at the next meeting on Sep. 17.

Beyond the immediate movements, Kronos' Liu said he expects the U.S. SEC's recently announced ""Project Crypto"" to impact the markets positively down the road.

""The SEC's 'Project Crypto' is set to modernize regulations by clarifying token classifications and  introducing an innovation exemption for DeFi,"" Liu said.  ""This regulatory clarity could accelerate DeFi growth, reduce uncertainty, and boost market confidence in the coming months.""

                            Altcoins drive crypto rebound | Credit: Hameem Sarwar                        


Key Takeaways

This week is kicking off positively as the crypto market turns higher after a stretch of choppy trading and uncertainty last week. Total market capitalization has surged to $3.7 trillion.

The rebound is due to improved sentiment and renewed institutional inflows in several large-cap tokens. This analysis breaks down the key drivers behind the surge and what the coming days could hold for BTC dominance and altcoin performance.

Despite the market's broader upswing, Bitcoin (BTC) has again slipped below $115,000. This time, however, altcoins are stealing the spotlight.

Ethereum (ETH) has climbed to $3,550, posting a modest 2.45% gain over the past 24 hours. But the real action is in the high-flyers. For example, MYX Finance (MYX) has surged nearly 100%, Spark (SPK) is up 35%, and Ethena (ENA) has added 12%.

Therefore, the crypto market is up because more capital flows into altcoins.

From a technical perspective, the 4-hour chart shows that Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) — the share of the total crypto market cap held by BTC — has slipped from 62.54% to 61.97%.

This starkly contrasts its position last week, when it formed higher highs, which caused altcoin prices to decline. Beyond that, the image below shows that it has formed a bear flag.

As such, Bitcoin's price is likely to face renewed downside pressure. Furthermore, in blue, the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has slipped below the 50-day EMA (yellow) — a death cross formation.

Thus, Bitcoin's price is likely to face renewed downside pressure. Furthermore, the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), in blue, has slipped below the 50-day EMA (yellow) — a death cross formation.

This crossover is a bearish technical signal, indicating that short-term momentum has weakened relative to the medium-term trend.

Historically, death crosses on BTC precede extended consolidation periods or deeper corrections.

In line with this view, crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe said Bitcoin may retest $112,000. He also noted signs that it could rebound to a new all-time high next month.

Meanwhile, unlike BTC.D, the TOTAL2 index has broken above a descending channel on the 4-hour chart. This index tracks the market cap of all altcoins, excluding Bitcoin.

The breakout ends weeks of lower highs and lower lows. It also shows that altcoins are starting to recover faster than BTC.

Also, the Money Flow Index (MFI) on the 4-hour chart has risen above the neutral line. This indicates rising buying pressure around the altcoin.

If this trend holds, the total altcoin market cap could soon surpass $1.55 trillion. In that scenario, altcoins — not Bitcoin — may keep the crypto market up in the coming weeks.

However, if BTC.D rises again, altcoins might experience a pushback, which could drag the crypto market down.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Major Banks Invest $100M+ in Blockchain Tech, Uplift Bitcoin Hyper","https://bitcoinist.com/banks-invest-in-blockchain-uplift-bitcoin-hyper/","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 12:25:43 GMT","

A new report by Ripple, CB Insights, and the UK Centre of Blockchain Technologies reveals that the blockchain is no longer just for the crypto bros – global banking giants are among its most active investors.

Titled ‘Banking on Digital Assets: How Traditional Finance is Investing in Blockchain', the report found that between 2020 and 2024, over $100B was invested in blockchain firms across over 10K deals.

Of those, 345 investments included major banks, with 33 of those contributions topping $100M. Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Japan's SBI Group were among the biggest spenders.

Interestingly, tokenization emerged as a core focus of their strategies.

This underscores how committed TradFi giants are to expanding investor access through Web3 tech, plus how vital the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Layer 2 solution could become in supporting that infrastructure.

The reason is that blockchain technology can streamline transactions, slash costs, and enable global access around the clock.

Among the 33 banks investing over $100M, the research found that the highest investments came from institutions based in the US and Japan, followed by Singapore, France, and the UK.

Of the ‘mega-round' deals, the Web3 use cases that stood out among TradFi firms included institutional infrastructure for trading, staking, and tokenization. Together, they accounted for 27% of deals.

This growing appeal comes from the fact that tokenization enables investors to purchase small portions of traditionally high-cost assets, like real estate or bonds. This helps open up investment opportunities to more participants.

So, it's no surprise that major banks are already investing heavily in this space. For instance, JPMorgan's Kinexys platform enables tokenized US Treasury transactions.

Meanwhile HSBC has launched a tokenized gold product for both institutional and retail investors.

Also signaling a rosy future for the industry is that the SEC Chairman, Paul Atkins, plans to boost tokenization in the US through ‘Project Crypto,' his latest crypto initiative.

He recently announced that Commission staff will take active steps to remove regulatory roadblocks and work with firms looking to tokenize stocks, bonds, and other securities.

Of course, it's also great news for Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), an upcoming Layer-2 with a bridge to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is designed for super-fast, secure, and scalable $BTC transactions.

It also includes the foundational tools needed to power future tokenized economies, like smart contracts, DeFi, and the ability to mint wrapped crypto assets cross-chain.

To achieve this, the project leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which helps bring Solana-style smart contract capabilities to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Here's how it works:

To preserve Bitcoin's base layer security while scaling activity off-chain, transactions are batched and verified using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs. This ensures fast, trustless execution with minimal on-chain footprint.

If you hold $HYPER, the project's native token, you can also enjoy lower gas fees, governance rights, and staking rewards at a 156% APY.

$HYPER has already raised $6.8M+, backed by individual whale investments like $54.1K and $53.9K back in June. And these were the investors that got in early, before the presale price hit $0.012525.

Given that its mainnet launch could propel the $HYPER token to $0.32, now's a great time to join for gains possibly exceeding 2,455%.

As interest in Bitcoin Hyper's Layer 2 solution continues to grow, so too does the presale.

It's attracting early supporters eager to capitalize and utilize its high-speed infrastructure, real-world utility, and tokenized future.

As traditional banks invest more into the blockchain and the SEC makes moves to make its crypto policy less stringent, a new era of tokenized finance is quickly falling into place.

It appears that Bitcoin Hyper is launching at a peak time. With its SVM-powered execution layer, trustless bridging, and real-world utility across DeFi, it has the potential to support future tokenized assets in a permissionless, public ecoystem.

You can unlock the L2's full potential by purchasing $HYPER on presale today.

This isn't investment advice. DYOR and put in more than you're willing to lose.

By Biswanath BhattacharjeeAugust 4, 2025

In today's complex global economy, supply chains serve as the circulatory system of commerce. From sourcing raw materials to delivering finished goods, efficient and secure supply chain operations are vital for business success. Yet, many companies still rely on fragmented, opaque systems prone to inefficiencies, fraud and delays. To overcome these challenges, forward-thinking organizations are now turning to the power of blockchain and machine learning (ML) to create more transparent, intelligent and agile supply chains. Together, these technologies are driving a new era of business innovation.

Building a Smart Supply Chain: The Role of Blockchain and ML

An effective next-generation supply chain integrates blockchain's decentralized transparency with machine learning's predictive intelligence. Below are the key components businesses are deploying to modernize operations and gain a competitive edge:

1. Data Integrity and Transparency with Blockchain

Blockchain creates an immutable, time-stamped ledger of every transaction or movement in the supply chain. From the origin of raw materials to final delivery, each event is securely recorded and verified by network participants. This real-time visibility ensures product authenticity, minimizes fraud and allows all stakeholders to trust the information being shared.For example, food companies can use blockchain to trace produce from farm to table, ensuring freshness and safety. If a product recall is needed, blockchain enables swift and accurate identification of affected batches, preventing broader contamination or financial loss.

2. Predictive Analytics through Machine Learning

ML algorithms analyze massive volumes of structured and unstructured data including shipping records, weather forecasts and inventory levels to detect patterns and anticipate potential disruptions. This predictive capability enables businesses to optimize demand forecasting, reduce waste and streamline inventory management.Retailers, for instance, can use ML to forecast sales spikes during holiday seasons and adjust inventory accordingly. Logistics providers can anticipate bottlenecks or delays and reroute shipments preemptively.

3. Smart Contracts for Process Automation

Blockchain-enabled smart contracts automatically execute predefined actions when specific conditions are met. These self-enforcing contracts reduce administrative overhead and human error by automating tasks such as payments, customs clearance and compliance checks.A shipment reaching its destination can automatically trigger payment to the supplier, reducing delays and enhancing trust between partners. This automation also improves cash flow and accelerates the entire procurement cycle.

4. Anomaly Detection and Risk Management

Machine learning models are especially effective at detecting irregularities across large datasets. In a supply chain context, ML can flag unexpected delivery delays, unauthorized access to goods or anomalies in supplier performance.By combining anomaly detection with blockchain's secure audit trail, businesses gain both real-time insights and historical accountability. This layered approach improves risk mitigation, particularly in industries such as pharmaceuticals or aerospace where quality control is critical.

5. Sustainable and Ethical Sourcing

Consumers and regulators are demanding greater accountability in how products are sourced and manufactured. Blockchain allows businesses to document every step in the supply chain, proving that materials are ethically sourced or environmentally sustainable.Machine learning can further help by identifying suppliers that meet sustainability criteria or predicting the environmental impact of different sourcing strategies. This transparency supports ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) goals while boosting brand reputation.

Implementation Challenges and Considerations

Despite their transformative potential, integrating blockchain and ML into business operations is not without hurdles:

Data Standardization: For blockchain to function effectively across a network, data formats and reporting standards must be consistent. Achieving this across diverse partners can be challenging.

High Initial Investment: Developing blockchain infrastructure and training ML models requires significant upfront costs which may deter smaller enterprises.

Scalability and Interoperability: Blockchain networks must handle high transaction volumes without compromising speed. Likewise, ML models must be scalable and adaptable to changing data environments.

Security and Privacy: While blockchain enhances security, safeguarding sensitive supplier or customer information remains a top priority. Combining cryptographic protocols with secure ML data pipelines is essential.

Key Enablers for Success

To fully realize the benefits of blockchain and ML in supply chains, organizations must:

Conclusion

The fusion of blockchain and machine learning represents a breakthrough in supply chain innovation. Blockchain provides the transparency, trust and traceability needed in today's global networks while machine learning offers predictive power and operational intelligence.

Together, these technologies are transforming how businesses manage their operations, mitigate risk and deliver value to customers. As supply chains grow more complex and expectations for accountability rise, embracing blockchain and ML is no longer optional—it is the pathway to resilience, sustainability and long-term success.

Now is the time for business leaders to invest, collaborate and lead the charge toward smarter, data-driven supply chains that can adapt and thrive in the digital age.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Are NFTs just a fad?","https://eng.ambcrypto.com/are-nfts-just-a-fad/","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 03:02:55 GMT","

Uncover the truth about why millions hold dead assets, & what makes the top 5% NFTs valuable.

Data shows that 95% of NFT collections are completely worthless. Is the market saturated, or is there more brewing under the surface?

The flashy, multi-million dollar NFT sales everyone hears about are a smokescreen. Dig a little deeper, and you'll find a digital graveyard.

The truth is, about 95% of NFT collections are completely worthless, with a market cap of zero ether. That leaves an estimated 23 million people holding assets they can't sell.

The numbers are brutal. One 2024 look at over 29,000 new NFT collections found almost 98% were dead on arrival, showing virtually no trading after their launch.

The market was simply flooded with too many projects lacking any real artistic vision, a good story, or a practical use.

With so much supply, a staggering 79% of all NFT collections have never even been sold, creating a tough environment for anyone trying to sell.

Even the big names aren't safe. An analysis of supposedly top-shelf NFT collections showed that 18% had a floor price of zero.

A huge chunk of the market, about 41%, consists of cheap tokens priced between $5 and $100. Less than one percent of all NFTs are actually worth more than $6,000.

On average, an NFT project flames out in just over a year, which is a much shorter lifespan than a typical crypto venture.

Most of these failures boil down to the same problems: no one joined the community, the money ran out, or the marketing was terrible. Widespread scams and “rug pulls” have also left investors understandably jumpy.

So what about the tiny 5% that actually succeed? They aren't just lucky. These heavy hitters, the rare survivors, all share a few things.

Some, like the 2017-era CryptoPunks, are valuable simply because they were first; they're digital history. Others ride on the coattails of famous digital artists like Beeple or XCOPY, whose reputations carry weight.

But the real secret sauce is often community and perks. A Bored Ape Yacht Club [BAYC] token isn't just a picture of an ape; it's a ticket to an exclusive club with events and commercial rights.

That sense of belonging, combined with genuine artistic innovation seen in projects like Art Blocks' “Chromie Squiggle” or Dmitri Cherniak's “Ringers,” is what turns a JPEG into a lasting asset.

This is why projects like Azuki have delivered over a 2.3x return to holders, and why Pudgy Penguins [PENGU] and Milady Maker have survived market crashes on the back of dedicated fans and smart partnerships.

The biggest problem haunting most NFT owners is that they're stuck. They can't cash out. This is called illiquidity—having an asset that nobody wants to buy, at least not without a massive price cut.

The market is drowning in sellers, while buyers are few and far between. This means if you want to sell, you either have to wait forever or practically give it away.

For the countless NFTs with zero trading activity, this problem is absolute. As a potential fix, some are now offering loans using top-tier NFTs as collateral.

The fact that some of these loans have terms up to three years shows that lenders are starting to believe in the staying power of a select few collections.

Ultimately, the NFT world is split in two. There's the tiny, exclusive club of valuable assets, propped up by history, art, and community.

Then there's everyone else, holding digital receipts for projects that went nowhere. It's a high-stakes game of speculation and hype.

Navigating this space successfully means looking past the noise and doing the hard work to spot what's real.

Hiring in crypto is hard – Campus makes it easy. Try The Block's hiring tool for free today.

Billionaire Adam Weitsman, an investor and owner of a scrap metal processing company, said he bought over 5,000 NFTs from Yuga Labs, the web3 studio behind the once wildly-popular Bored Ape Yacht Club token collection.

""Today is a special day for me. I'm making a long-term investment in Otherside and acquiring over 5,000 Otherdeeds, Mega Kodas and Weapon Kodas direct from Yuga Labs to continue building my collection,"" the entrepreneur posted to X on Monday, adding that he's also committed to ""making a series of acquisitions on the open market this year.""

Amid a collapsed NFT market, Yuga Labs has, in recent months, been forced to sell prime brands like Moonbirds and CryptoPunks, collections that used to rank among the top in terms of trading volume. In March, DappRadar said trading volumes for the most popular NFT collections had declined by 95%.



Weitsman said he hopes his purchase will help to support Yuga Labs' efforts to build out its metaverse project, Otherside.

""I have recently seen Yuga refocus and prioritize [ [Otherside]. There is a lot riding on this project for the whole space and I will do my best to help make it a success for everyone,"" he wrote.

When Otherside first launched in May 2022, the parcels of virtual land called ""Otherdeeds"" sold out within hours and netted Yuga Labs $317 million in sales. The NFTs entitle the holder to a plot of land in the game and a creature called a Koda, which lives on the land.

Almost immediately after, trading volume more or less flatlined, according to CryptoSlam data. The floor price for an Otherside Otherdeed was about $640 on Monday, according to OpenSea data. In late 2023, Yuga Labs' then-CEO said that after a company restructuring, the firm would focus on developing Otherside.

""Otherside is a gamified, interoperable metaverse currently under development,"" according to the project's website. ""The game blends mechanics from massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) and web3-enabled virtual worlds. Think of it as a metaRPG where the players own the world, your NFTs can become playable characters, and thousands can play together in real time.""

After tremendous fervor revolving around metaverse projects, principally launched by Meta, and web3 platforms like The Sandbox and Decentraland, metaverse-focused development effectively came to a halt when crypto prices fell amid a bearish cycle.

The NFT market had an exciting day on 4th August 2025, with Courtyard being the most traded collection and Blur, the largest NFT marketplace. There was continued activity on legacy projects, as well as on emerging projects, with some high-value transactions, and a shift in collector interest.

#NFT MARKET OVERVIEW                                                                  TOP COLLECTION                                                                 #Courtyard – 24H Volume $2.25M… pic.twitter.com/ZwDjsNEQkO

Courtyard had the largest number of trading activity among NFT collections, reaching a peak of $2.25 million in sales over an incredible 27,450 sales. 

Such a level of transactions is a strong indicator of high participation at low price levels, a pattern that is becoming more common. The second-highest in volume is Pudgy Penguins, with transactions that generated high-value gross sales of $1.67 million with only 28 transactions completed.

CryptoPunks remained a blue-chip NFT as it traded six sales worth a total of $1.09 million. Lil Pudgys, a Pudgy Penguins ecosystem derivative, sold 78 at a total of $437,620, further indicating the health of the ecosystem. 

Moonbirds followed it up with $407,370 and 47 deals. Mutant Ape Yach Club recorded the sales volume of $334,760 with 32 sales, maintaining its position at the highest level on the list of the NFTs.

Fantasy sports game Sorare has amassed 18,990 sales, and 24-hour trading volume reached the level of $326,160, indicating high activity on the platform. Another surprising performance was Guild of Guardians with a balance of $311,700 and 393 transactions. 

Bored Ape Yacht Club which was a market leader, recorded a sale of $288,820 based on seven deals. And Zuki ranked tenth at a profit of $266,130 in 29 trades hence maintaining their position despite previous ups and downs.

The highest 24-hour sale was of Pudgy Penguin #77, which sold at $244,110. Four of the top five highest sales belonged to CryptoPunks. CryptoPunk 8124 was sold at $214,310, and CryptoPunk 1834 at $194,500. CryptoPunk #812 and CryptoPunk #839 sold at $190,530 and $183,970, respectively. These figures once again confirm the long-standing popularity of CryptoPunks among the best collectors and investors.

The largest NFT marketplace within the past 24 hours was Blur, which recorded a trading volume of $3.01 million and 662 active traders. Its continued incentives and focus on pro traders have maintained that it leads the rankings. 

Courtyard also came in with marketplace volumes of $1.16 million and 1,940 traders, which further validates its healthy ecosystem dynamic.

CryptoPunks marketplace also created $1.09M based on just 11 traders with high average transaction value and exclusive participants. 

Meanwhile, OpenSea, which was the largest marketplace, reported a volume of $943,000 with 4,580 traders, signifying wider adoption with smaller average ticket sizes. With its multichain approach, Magic Eden ended the day with 1,890 traders and a volume of $414,000.

The gap between the quantity of sales and transactions shows trends that will define user actions. Early-stage collections such as Courtyard and Sorare are enjoying the advantages of low-cost, high-frequency participation and are attractive to more collectors and gamers. 

Simultaneously, older projects such as Pudgy Penguins and CryptoPunks are still selling at high per-sale prices to deep-pocketed investors.

The NFT space has reached a new and mature stage with a daily sale of more than 3 million flowing through Blur and substantial growth in projects such as Courtyard. 

Valued community involvement and integrations in the real world are leading to high interest by investors in ecosystems.

Regardless of low-cost volume or high-value exclusivity, the NFT market is rapidly changing with every day that goes by.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","ICO publishes guidance on profiling tools for online safety compliance","https://ppc.land/ico-publishes-guidance-on-profiling-tools-for-online-safety-compliance/","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 05:41:39 GMT","

Data protection watchdog clarifies requirements for trust systems ahead of UK regulatory changes.

The Information Commissioner's Office published comprehensive guidance on July 30, 2025, addressing data protection obligations for organizations deploying profiling tools in trust and safety systems. The 12-section document establishes compliance frameworks for user-to-user services implementing behavioral analysis technologies to meet Online Safety Act requirements.

According to the ICO, profiling tools analyze user characteristics, behavior, interests or preferences through automated processing of personal data. These systems support trust and safety operations including detection of grooming behavior, terrorism, violent extremism, bullying, harassment, fraud, scams, spamming, and fake accounts. The guidance applies to both organizations developing internal profiling systems and third-party providers offering trust and safety technologies.

The regulator defines profiling tools as systems that assign ratings or scores to users, such as risk scores or reputation indicators showing likelihood of terms of service violations or bot account probability. Tools may retain and continuously update analysis outputs or produce temporary evaluations for specific decision points.

Organizations must identify lawful processing bases before deploying profiling tools, with legal obligation and legitimate interests representing the most relevant options for trust and safety applications. According to the guidance, legal obligation applies when processing supports compliance with Online Safety Act duties, provided the personal information processing remains necessary and proportionate to achieve compliance.

The legitimate interests basis requires organizations to conduct three-part assessments identifying their legitimate interest, demonstrating processing necessity, and balancing interests against user rights and freedoms. Organizations using profiling for terms of service enforcement or Online Safety Act compliance may establish legitimate interests, but must demonstrate compelling justification for privacy-intrusive methods.

Contract serves as a lawful basis when profiling tools are integral to core service delivery and represent proportionate methods for achieving organizational purposes. However, consent becomes relevant primarily when organizations require user permission for storage and access technologies under Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations.

The ICO requires data protection impact assessments before deploying profiling tools due to high-risk processing characteristics. These systems collect information at significant scale, potentially leading to unwarranted intrusion and loss of personal data control. They make decisions producing significant user effects, potentially causing discrimination, reputational damage or financial harm through loss of income or employment.

Organizations must document processing nature, scope, context and purposes while assessing necessity and proportionality of planned operations. Risk identification must consider likelihood and severity of potential harm to user rights and freedoms, with mitigation measures documented for each identified risk.

According to the guidance, ""Given your processing is likely to be high risk, you must carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) prior to processing personal information in your profiling tools."" The requirement extends to all profiling deployments regardless of organizational size or user volume.

Data protection by design and default requirements mandate privacy considerations throughout profiling tool development and operation. Organizations must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to effectively implement data protection principles while integrating necessary safeguards into processing operations.

The guidance states organizations must ""make data protection an essential component of the core functionality of your profiling tools"" while processing only personal information necessary for specified purposes. Users must receive information enabling easy understanding of personal information usage in profiling systems.

For children's data processing, the ICO requires conformance with the Children's Code, which recommends switching profiling off by default unless compelling reasons justify activation. Examples include profiling to meet legal or regulatory requirements, prevent child sexual exploitation or abuse, or support age assurance functions.

Organizations must inform users about profiling tool deployment through privacy notices meeting UK GDPR Article 13 requirements. Information must include processing confirmation, purposes, lawful bases, retention periods, third-party sharing arrangements, user rights, and automated decision-making details affecting users.

The guidance emphasizes additional transparency considerations given profiling tools' intrusive nature. Organizations should consider providing information about decision types made through tools and automated technologies utilized, balanced against risks of malicious users circumventing detection systems.

According to the document, ""Transparency is closely linked to fairness. You are unlikely to be treating users fairly if you do not tell them about how you use their personal information."" Organizations must use varied communication techniques including dedicated website areas, signup information, user dashboards, and moderation action notifications.

Processing special category information through profiling tools requires Article 9 conditions beyond lawful bases. This applies when systems use race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric identification data, health data, sex life or sexual orientation information as inputs or generate such inferences.

The substantial public interest condition under Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 2018 provides the most relevant framework for trust and safety applications. Organizations may rely on preventing or detecting unlawful acts, regulatory requirements, or safeguarding of children and at-risk individuals conditions, typically requiring appropriate policy documents.

Criminal offense information processing requires Article 10 conditions and Schedule 1 compliance. This encompasses suspicion or allegations of criminal activity alongside formal convictions and offenses. Organizations must demonstrate processing occurs under official authority control or domestic law authorization through specific Schedule 1 conditions.

The guidance distinguishes between data protection accuracy requirements and statistical accuracy concepts. Organizations must take reasonable steps ensuring personal information used and generated by profiling tools remains factually correct while keeping information current when necessary.

Statistical accuracy concerns how frequently AI systems produce correct predictions measured against properly labeled test data. Organizations must consider statistical adequacy for intended purposes without requiring 100% accuracy, but should evaluate incorrect assessment possibilities and their user impact.

According to the document, profiling tool outputs often represent predictions about behavioral likelihood rather than factual user information. Organizations should ensure records indicate outputs constitute ""statistically informed guesses, rather than facts"" to prevent misinterpretation as definitive user characteristics.

Profiling tool deployment triggers enhanced user rights under data protection legislation. Subject access requests must provide confirmation of personal information processing, copies of input and output data, and moderation decision information generated through profiling analysis.

The guidance notes personal information responses should exclude non-personal commercial or confidential information while addressing potential multi-person data situations. Organizations must consider whether subject access compliance can occur without disclosing third-party information or whether consent or reasonable disclosure circumstances apply.

Rectification requests require reconsideration of information accuracy even when organizations previously validated system functioning. Users objecting to legitimate interests processing may compel cessation unless organizations demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds overriding user interests, rights and freedoms, or processing supports legal claim establishment, exercise or defense.

Solely automated decisions producing legal or similarly significant user effects require Article 22 compliance when profiling supports such determinations. The guidance defines solely automated decisions as those ""taken without any meaningful human involvement"" while legal or similarly significant effects include financial impact, exclusion, discrimination, or substantial influence on user behavior or choices.

Organizations relying on domestic law authorization, contract necessity, or explicit consent exceptions must implement appropriate safeguards protecting user rights, freedoms and legitimate interests. Domestic law authorization includes Online Safety Act compliance where solely automated decision-making represents the most appropriate implementation method.

Required safeguards include enabling human intervention, allowing users to express viewpoints, and providing decision contestation mechanisms. Online Safety Act complaints processes may satisfy these requirements when properly implemented alongside data protection law obligations.

The guidance affects programmatic advertising platforms, customer data platforms, and marketing automation systems utilizing systematic monitoring, profiling, or large-scale personal data processing. Organizations operating comprehensive analytics solutions tracking user behavior across digital touchpoints likely require data protection officer appointments under emerging regulatory frameworks.

Recent coverage on PPC Land examined ICO's consent or pay model guidance, demonstrating the regulator's comprehensive approach to balancing commercial viability with privacy protection. The profiling guidance extends this framework to trust and safety technologies increasingly deployed across digital platforms.

Marketing professionals must prepare for enhanced regulatory visibility into data processing practices as UK authorities continue coordinating with European counterparts despite post-Brexit regulatory divergence. Cross-border operations require navigation of both UK reporting requirements and European transparency obligations under varying jurisdictional frameworks.

Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA): These mandatory evaluations identify and mitigate privacy risks before deploying profiling tools. Organizations must document processing nature, scope, context, and purposes while assessing necessity and proportionality. The ICO requires DPIAs due to profiling's high-risk characteristics including large-scale data collection, significant user effects, and potential discrimination risks.

Online Safety Act: This UK legislation establishes duties for user-to-user services to protect users from illegal content and harmful behaviors. The Act creates legal obligations that may justify profiling tool deployment under data protection law's legal obligation basis, provided processing remains necessary and proportionate for compliance.

Personal Information: Any data relating to identified or identifiable individuals, including user-generated content, account details, activity data, and behavioral inferences. Profiling tools process extensive personal information across input, analysis, output, and application stages, requiring careful consideration of data minimization and accuracy principles.

Legitimate Interests: A lawful processing basis requiring three-part assessment of organizational interests, processing necessity, and balancing against user rights. Organizations using profiling for terms of service enforcement or safety compliance may establish legitimate interests but must demonstrate compelling justification for privacy-intrusive methods.

Special Category Information: Sensitive personal data including race, political opinions, religious beliefs, health data, and sexual orientation requiring additional Article 9 processing conditions. Profiling tools may process this information directly as inputs or generate such inferences, necessitating substantial public interest conditions and appropriate policy documents.

Automated Decision-Making: Processing that produces decisions without meaningful human involvement, potentially triggering Article 22 restrictions when creating legal or similarly significant effects. Organizations must implement safeguards including human intervention rights, viewpoint expression opportunities, and decision contestation mechanisms.

Trust and Safety Systems: Organizational processes protecting users from harmful experiences through detection and prevention of grooming, terrorism, fraud, harassment, and other malicious activities. These systems increasingly rely on profiling tools to analyze user behavior patterns and characteristics for proactive threat identification.

Profiling Tools: Technologies using automated processing to evaluate user characteristics, behavior, interests, or preferences for predictive analysis. These systems assign risk scores, reputation indicators, or behavioral classifications to support moderation decisions and safety measures across digital platforms.

Processing: Any operation performed on personal data including collection, analysis, storage, sharing, and decision-making. Profiling involves extensive processing across multiple stages from input data gathering through output application, requiring comprehensive compliance with data protection principles.

User Rights: Individual entitlements under data protection law including access, rectification, objection, and protection from solely automated decision-making. Organizations deploying profiling tools must facilitate these rights through appropriate response procedures, accuracy reconsideration processes, and decision contestation mechanisms.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","XRP Rival Explodes 424% With Traders Saying It's the Best ICO Since Solana And Ethereum","https://coincentral.com/xrp-rival-explodes-424-with-traders-saying-its-the-best-ico-since-solana-and-ethereum/","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 12:00:08 GMT","

While big names like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) remain favorites among institutional investors, a new player is quietly taking headlines: Remittix (RTX).

With a stunning 400% to 424% gain during its ICO phase and real-world use built in, analysts say it could be one of the best ICOs since Solana and Ethereum.



According to industry coverage, Remittix's ICO has raised over $18 million, trading at $0.0895. Analysts project a path to $1 by 2025, and some targets as high as $2 based on adoption trends in emerging markets.

By contrast, Solana, which saw a price rise of up to 44% within a week, still hovers near long-term resistance zones around $200, with more modest growth expectations through 2025.



Experts draw parallels between Solana's price and Ethereum's price, as well as the early stages of both projects' success, including low capitalization, infrastructure themes, and Remittix's utility-first PayFi model. They argue that demographically, RTX's product has an even broader appeal: the $150 trillion global cross-border payment market.

While Solana and Ethereum build development ecosystems, Remittix stands out for solving a real consumer pain point with its crypto-to-fiat remittance network; faster, cheaper, and more secure than traditional platforms.



Some tools that track whale activity have noted that early SOL and ADA investors are rotating capital into Remittix. Prominent crypto traders publicly cited RTX as their top pick heading into Q2–Q3 of 2025.

This isn't hype. With over $18 million raised, 580 million tokens sold, and Beta Wallet launch slated for September 2025, Remittix is being described as more than an ICO; it's a platform preparing for lift-off.

Analysts and crypto media cite multiple value-driving catalysts:

Given these milestones, moderate forecasts place RTX in the $0.20–$0.30 range within months, with bullish models pushing to $1–$2 by early 2026, making the token's 424% presale gains feel just the beginning.

More importantly, it's the first and probably best ICO of 2025 that makes the comparison feel plausible rather than forced. While Solana and Ethereum build future utility, Remittix is delivering usable payment solutions today.

For anyone seeking high-potential, utility-based tokens, RTX is delivering serious returns, and few projects have achieved this with the same level of structure. In the words of a top trader: “This feels like the next Solana, only built for the payments age”.

Dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin (BTC) years ago could have turned modest investments into life-changing returns, but replicating that path is far more challenging today.

While BTC still has room to move higher, starting DCA at current levels leaves far less upside. A move from $114,300 to $228,600 doesn't translate to a clean 2x if your average entry sits near the top – and in Bitcoin's early days, a 2x was just a walk in the park. That's why some investors are turning toward Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a project aiming to deliver the kind of early-stage upside BTC once offered.





Bitcoin Hyper takes the foundation of Bitcoin and extends it, adding programmability and transaction speeds on par with Solana. These features have fueled strong investor interest, with the presale now approaching $7 million in commitments after just 60 days.

That pace of funding shows no signs of slowing. The current presale round closes in 24 hours, keeping HYPER at $0.012525 until the timer runs out, after which the price will step higher in the next stage.

It makes sense to make incremental investments into the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, especially with the rate at which it has appreciated over the years.

A YouTuber tested this approach starting in August 2024, putting $5 into Bitcoin every single day. The idea behind dollar-cost averaging is simple: as the asset grows over time, small, consistent buys build a position. High entries get balanced out by low ones, smoothing the cost basis and often pulling the portfolio into profit over the long term.

It's a similar method to what Strategy has employed, though on a much larger scale. The firm now holds 628,791 BTC, currently worth about $72.1 billion.

For Strategy, which ramped up its buying this year, returns are solid but far from astronomical, at around 25%. The edge came from earlier moves, including allocations in 2020 during Bitcoin's breakout and more accumulation through the crypto winter of 2022–2023.

Back to the YouTuber. After nearly a year of $5 daily buys, his returns are more modest. In a year when Bitcoin broke into six-digit prices for the first time, his portfolio is up around 5% after 323 days – less than Strategy's returns at the start of the year.

﻿

That doesn't make him a loser. His later entry just means the compounding is slower compared to those who built positions earlier in the cycle.

The question is what would happen if he had started DCA earlier in the same year Strategy began its BTC accumulation.

Putting in $5 a day since 2020 adds up to $9,130. Using daily open prices, that total investment would have built a position of roughly 0.275 BTC. At today's price, that's worth about $31,465 – a gain of 244.63% over five years.



The returns would have been even greater if that $9,130 had been deployed as a lump sum in 2020. At that point, it would have bought around 0.81 BTC, worth $92,918 at Bitcoin's current $114,300 rate – a 917.73% return.

That kind of profit could buy a pre-owned Porsche 911 Carrera or a Rolex Daytona.

The takeaway is simple: early positioning in the right crypto matters. Getting into Bitcoin now might still bring fairly satisfactory gains especially if it runs toward $300,000 or even $1 million, but the exponential early-stage returns are harder to capture at this stage. With Bitcoin now firmly in the institutional spotlight, its moves are not as rapid as they once were.

That's why investors are searching for the next opportunity capable of producing Bitcoin-like results. Right now, few projects stand out like Bitcoin Hyper – the only one extending Bitcoin's scalability at speeds comparable to Solana.

What Bitcoin Hyper is doing is expanding the most secure blockchain in the world into making it programmable and capable of hosting dApps that go beyond payments, covering DeFi, gaming, memes, and other applications.

But it's far from just programmability. The project also leverages Solana's execution layer to ensure transactions within those dApps are processed at lightning speed.

This is achieved by incorporating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), one of the fastest execution environments in the world.



The connection happens through a bridge that locks BTC on the Bitcoin network. In return, a wrapped version of BTC is minted within the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem. This wrapped BTC can move seamlessly across dApps built on Bitcoin Hyper, all while the original BTC remains secured on the Bitcoin blockchain. When users choose to withdraw, their locked BTC is released back to them.

The result is a high-performance Layer-2 where Bitcoin's security anchors the network, and Solana's speed and efficiency unlock new utility at scale.

The question now is whether to buy HYPER in a lump sum or to DCA like Bitcoin. As you can see, the YouTuber's returns would have been far greater had he bought Bitcoin at lower prices.

Bitcoin Hyper is currently at its lowest price during its ongoing presale. Once it starts trading on exchanges, getting in at this rate may no longer be possible.

Adoption is the catalyst that pushes asset prices higher, just as it did with BTC. As more investors catch on to what Bitcoin Hyper is building, demand can change quickly.

By that point, the window for early positioning may have closed, leaving late buyers with smaller returns as the token grows into a substantial market cap.

For precedent, Layer-2 solutions are essential to scalability. In fact, Layer-2 tokens have grown to a combined valuation of $14.9 billion. These scaling layers are critical to Ethereum's growth and the same will apply to Bitcoin.

Though multiple attempts have been made to scale Bitcoin, none have the foundation and approach of Bitcoin Hyper. That's why supporting it at this stage is like backing a new version of Bitcoin that carries the potential for exponential returns.

The $7 million milestone could be reached within hours.

To be part of it, head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and secure HYPER while the current round is still live. Tokens can be bought using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card.

For the smoothest experience, Best Wallet offers direct access. HYPER is already listed under Upcoming Tokens, making it simple to track, manage, and claim once live.

The White House's new 166-page Digital Asset report delivers a clear message: private sector innovation over government issued digital currency. But the policy details reveal a more complex picture.

Trump's January executive order banned CBDCs entirely and tasked a President's Working Group – notably excluding the Federal Reserve and banking regulators – with drafting this comprehensive framework. Despite consulting these agencies, the report takes an adversarial stance toward them.

Hedera (HBAR) racked up a triple-header of real-world adoption over the last few weeks: Reserve Bank of Australia's wholesale-CBDC pilot, NVIDIA-backed “verifiable compute,” and a UK-first tokenized-asset collateral trade starring Lloyds, abrdn, and Archax; and the aftershocks keep rumbling. 

Toss in a consumer-rewards launch that on-boards 24 million Web2 users and July's pro-crypto policy tail-winds, and the hashgraph suddenly looks less “clever tech” and more “infrastructure governments can't ignore.”

CBDC Credibility Check

Project Acacia puts the RBA and DFCRC in the driver's seat, using Hedera rails to mint, move, and redeem central-bank IOUs in a sandbox bridging to the bank's HashSphere network. Council member Australian Payments Plus handles the plumbing. Wholesale rails are the plumber's tape of national finance; earning that G20 nod graduates Hedera from white-paper to regulator's clipboard.

Audit Trails For AIs That Don't Lie

On the compute side, EQTY Lab's Verifiable Compute now runs on NVIDIA Blackwell silicon, notarizing every inference via Hedera Consensus Service. Hardware-sealed attestations plus tamper-proof timestamps mean compliance teams get an immutable log proving models behaved and data stayed where policy said. For AI-governance hawks (and every board lawyer worried about hallucinating copilots) that's catnip.

Meanwhile in London, Lloyds and abrdn tokenized money-market-fund units and UK gilts on Hedera, then posted them as collateral for an FX trade cleared through FCA-regulated Archax. Translation: traditional finance just treated Hedera tokens as good collateral under existing UK law, no sandbox waiver required.

Layer on the U.S. CLARITY Act, the UK's DLT strategy, Hedera-to-Earn's cross-app reward token (HTE), and a $550 k “Hello Future” hackathon trilogy, and the network starts to look like a compliance-ready substrate for CBDCs, AI, RWAs, and mass-market loyalty loot—not an R&D exhibit.

In just a few weeks Hedera put government money, enterprise AI, consumer rewards, and institutional collateral on-chain. Not bad for a DAG that critics once called “neat but niche.” Keep the scorecards handy; the use-case column is finally filling up.

Ex-chancellor criticises hesitant approach to crypto and warns country in danger of missing next surge in market

Business live – latest updates

The UK has been left behind in the cryptocurrency boom and is in danger of missing a second wave of demand, according to the former chancellor George Osborne.

Osborne, who has an advisory role at the crypto exchange firm Coinbase, said the country already missed out on the first generation of crypto because the formerly sceptical US had embraced digital currencies under Donald Trump.

“What I see makes me anxious. Far from being an early adopter, we have allowed ourselves to be left behind,” wrote Osborne in a Financial Times opinion piece.

Osborne said the UK was now about to miss a new surge in the crypto market: stablecoins.

Unlike bitcoin, which is prone to extreme fluctuations in price, stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to the value of real-world currencies such as the dollar – and thus designed to maintain a stable value. However, a leading stablecoin, TerraUSD, collapsed in 2022.

“If Britain was the only financial centre in the world we could take our time to evaluate how stablecoins will develop, but we are not,” wrote Osborne. “Singapore, Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi have adopted comprehensive legislative frameworks for crypto asset platforms.”

Osborne also pointed to the passing of the US Genius Act, which creates a regulatory regime for stablecoins – the majority of which are now dollar-backed.

“The crypto revolution may have started with plans to replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency, but it is reinforcing its dominance. Britain's current approach ensures the pound won't even play a supporting role,” Osborne wrote.

US citizens can buy a bitcoin exchange traded fund – a basket of assets that can be bought and sold like shares on an exchange – whereas in the UK retail investors cannot do so.

Osborne accused the UK of prevaricating over stablecoins, with the current chancellor, Rachel Reeves, showing insufficient commitment with a promise last month to “drive forward” on stablecoins, while the Bank of England remained sceptical.

In a speech last month, the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, called for the development of standards that show whether stablecoins pass the test of “singleness of money” – or whether a stablecoin can be exchanged with another form of money one-for-one.

“This hesitation risks irrelevance,” wrote Osborne, who added that it was time for the UK to “catch up”.

Other crypto advocates from the era of the 2010-15 Conservative-led coalition government include another former chancellor, Philip Hammond, who is chair of the crypto firm Copper.

A Treasury spokesperson said the government's economic strategy was combining support for innovation with safety for consumers.

“Robust rules around crypto will boost investor confidence, support the growth of fintech and protect people across the UK,” the spokesperson said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","cryptocurrency"

For years, cryptocurrency evangelists promised digital money would revolutionize finance. Instead, most crypto became a vehicle for speculation, memes, and the occasional spectacular fraud. But this summer, something different happened: Wall Street started paying attention to stablecoins.

The passage of the GENIUS Act last month marked a legitimacy turning point, providing the first comprehensive U.S. regulation for digital tokens backed by conventional assets like Treasury bills and bank deposits. Suddenly, stablecoins — once dismissed as crypto curiosities — are being embraced by companies across a wide swatch of industries.

The reason? Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins promise the infrastructure benefits of digital money without the wild price swings, potentially replacing expensive, slow traditional payments with transactions that settle in minutes for pennies.

To understand why this matters, it helps to grasp what makes stablecoins different from the crypto tokens that came before. Think of Bitcoin and Ethereum as digital commodities. They fluctuate wildly based on market sentiment, making them poor candidates for everyday transactions. Stablecoins, by contrast, are designed to maintain a steady value by being backed 1:1 with conventional assets. The largest stablecoin, Tether (USDT), is theoretically worth exactly $1 because each token is backed by a dollar's worth of Treasury bills, cash, or other liquid assets.

This stability transforms the use case entirely, allowing stablecoins to function as actual currency for payments while leveraging blockchain technology for faster, cheaper transactions.

The distinction becomes clearer when compared to Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which have sparked fierce political debate. Both stablecoins and CBDCs are digital representations of money, but the control structure is fundamentally different. CBDCs would be issued and controlled directly by central banks like the Federal Reserve. Think of them as digital cash that could offer perfect privacy or perfect surveillance, depending on design choices.

The political battle lines are clear. Republican lawmakers have moved to ban CBDC development, fearing government surveillance, while embracing privately-issued stablecoins. Meanwhile, European officials like European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde worry that widespread stablecoin adoption amounts to ""the privatization of money.""

With that crucial distinction (hopefully) established, back to the GENIUS Act and why it represents such a watershed moment for the industry.

The legislation does three key things that had eluded stablecoins for years. First, it settles the existential question of what stablecoins actually are, confirming they are not securities and therefore don't face the regulatory maze that has ensnared other crypto tokens. Second, it requires full backing by safe assets like Treasury bills and bank deposits, addressing long-standing concerns about whether stablecoin issuers actually hold the reserves they claim. Third, it subjects issuers to anti-money laundering rules and regular audits, bringing them under the same compliance framework as traditional financial institutions.

The result has been an immediate rush of institutional interest. JPMorgan Chase, whose CEO Jamie Dimon once called Bitcoin a ""fraud,"" announced plans for its own stablecoin-like product called JPMorgan Deposit Token, according to CNBC. Interactive Brokers is considering launching a stablecoin for customers and enabling 24/7 funding of brokerage accounts, according to Reuters. Even retail giants like Amazon and Walmart are reportedly exploring their own tokens, which could work like supercharged gift cards that cut out credit card fees.

The numbers tell the story of an industry hitting its stride. There's already $263 billion in stablecoins circulating, up 60% from last year, according to The Economist, while Standard Chartered projects that figure could reach $2 trillion within three years. Transaction volumes already surpass those of Visa and Mastercard combined, driven largely by cross-border payments where stablecoins can replace $15 wire transfers with transactions costing pennies.

This surge in adoption creates the very paradox that has regulators on edge. The more useful stablecoins become, the more disruptive they will be to existing financial systems. The American Bankers Association has already sounded the alarm, warning that if banks lose just 10% of their $19 trillion in retail deposits to stablecoins, it would meaningfully increase their funding costs and squeeze lending capacity.

Yet for an industry built on the promise of disruption, these concerns sound more like validation than warning. The real test will come when the first major financial crisis hits a stablecoin-dependent system, or when geopolitical tensions force governments to choose between embracing dollar-denominated tokens or protecting monetary sovereignty. With regulatory clarity finally in place and Wall Street's seal of approval, stablecoins have moved from crypto curiosity to financial infrastructure. Whether that infrastructure proves as reliable as the system it's replacing remains to be seen.","{'href': 'https://qz.com', 'title': 'Quartz'}","cryptocurrency"

On July 30, 2025, the President's Working Group on Digital Assets released its report entitled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology.” The report champions American innovation in crypto, and “endorses the notion that digital assets and blockchain technologies can revolutionize not just America's financial system, but systems of ownership and governance economy-wide.”

The report lays the framework for a comprehensive, government-wide approach to regulatory reform in the sector. Produced with input from key federal agencies, the report lays out a series of core recommendations for a “new American Golden Age”:

Running over 160 pages, the report opens with a detailed glossary and lengthy background materials on the digital asset ecosystem. It then includes a series of detailed discussions around the following topics:  digital asset market structure, banking and digital assets, stablecoins and payments, countering illicit finance, and taxation. The report considers both the current and future states of digital financial technology and regulation, and concludes with dozens of recommendations for Congress, Treasury, Commerce, IRS, the federal banking regulators, the SEC and the CFTC. The report advocates for a mixture of legislation, agency action through rulemaking and exemptive orders, and the issuance of agency interpretive guidance. It also urges agencies to act in coordination.

Many of the report's key recommendations fall on the SEC. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins's July 30 statement in support of the recommendations is here. On July 31, Chairman Atkins also announced a bold plan to begin implementing the report's recommendations for the SEC, which he christened Project Crypto. “The days of convoluted offshore corporate structures, decentralization theater, and confusion over security status, are over,” Atkins proclaimed.

With traditional banking systems increasingly falling behind, the Seeker smartphone is stepping up to innovate the way we think about crypto payroll solutions. By integrating blockchain technology directly into a mobile device, it has the potential to change the landscape of payments for businesses everywhere. This article explores how this smartphone is more than just a gadget; it could be the key to unlocking seamless transactions and financial inclusion.

Cryptocurrency has transitioned from a niche curiosity into a critical component of modern finance. As decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology continue to gain traction, businesses are searching for ways to manage payroll and payments more effectively. Enter the Seeker smartphone by Solana Mobile, a device designed to incorporate crypto functionalities directly into a phone.

The Seeker smartphone is built for Web3 and blockchain applications, featuring a Seed Vault Wallet and access to the Solana dApp Store. This architecture allows for the management of crypto assets and decentralized applications (dApps) directly, minimizing reliance on traditional financial institutions. With the SKR token driving user engagement, the Seeker creates a sustainable framework for crypto payroll solutions.

Blockchain technology is secure and transparent, making it a perfect fit for payroll solutions. With the Seeker smartphone, businesses can pay employees and contractors in cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins. This approach not only cuts transaction costs but also enhances both security and privacy. Decentralized payroll tools streamline payment processes and can reach wider audiences, including the unbanked.

Selecting the right wallet for crypto payroll is crucial. The Seeker's Seed Vault Wallet offers a secure method for managing crypto assets, allowing companies to pay employees and contractors smoothly. MuralPay and Deel also provide specialized services, creating a range of options for companies looking to hire globally with crypto.

As crypto payroll solutions gain popularity, many Silicon Valley startups are exploring blockchain payments. However, the actual implementation of these solutions can be complicated. Companies must navigate regulatory compliance and security risks, along with the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. The Seeker smartphone helps tackle some of these issues by offering a user-friendly interface and secure infrastructure for managing transactions.

The Seeker smartphone provides many perks for businesses adopting crypto payroll. Its decentralized structure increases security, while blockchain technology simplifies payment processes. Utilizing stablecoin payments can help mitigate the risks that come with volatility. Plus, the Seeker's focus on user empowerment allows companies to take charge of their financial operations, fostering a more inclusive economy.

Though there are clear benefits, challenges exist when implementing crypto payroll solutions. Security issues, regulatory compliance, and the need for user education are all significant considerations. Additionally, the potential for governance centralization in decentralized ecosystems could undermine the promise of user empowerment. Companies need to adapt to the fast-changing world of crypto regulations and technologies.

The Seeker smartphone is poised to revolutionize payroll solutions by integrating blockchain and DeFi into a mobile platform. As more companies opt for crypto payments, the Seeker provides a secure, efficient, and user-friendly way to manage payroll. Embracing this technology can streamline financial operations and promote financial inclusion. The future of payroll is unfolding, and the Seeker smartphone is at the forefront of this change.

Your AI value-stock bloodhound—sniffing out overlooked gems with the upside to make contrarians cheer.

- Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) leverages a $2B Bitcoin treasury and institutional backing to build a crypto-native fintech/media hybrid.

- Its Truth.Fi platform offers pro-Trump ETFs and crypto-integrated services, targeting anti-ESG investors amid regulatory tailwinds from the GENIUS Act.

- The company's ""anti-fragile"" model combines Bitcoin gains, fintech fees, and media revenue, though a 50% YTD stock decline highlights execution and regulatory risks.

- TMTG's alignment with U.S. pro-crypto policies and strategic acquisitions position it as a long-term play at the crypto-media-finance intersection.

In a year marked by crypto market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) has emerged as a bold outlier. The company's strategic $2 billion Bitcoin treasury—backed by a $2.4 billion private placement from 50 institutional investors—positions it as a unique hybrid of media, fintech, and anti-fragile capital strategy. This article dissects TMTG's transformation from a social media platform into a crypto-enabled financial services juggernaut, evaluating its potential to outperform traditional institutions in a fragmented post-2024 financial landscape.  

TMTG's Q2 2025 earnings report revealed a Bitcoin treasury accounting for two-thirds of its $3.1 billion in liquid assets. This includes direct Bitcoin holdings and indirect exposure via Bitcoin ETFs, trusts, and derivatives. The company's “hybrid treasury model”—combining spot Bitcoin with options-based strategies—offers both liquidity and flexibility. For example, the $300 million allocated to Bitcoin options allows TMTG to convert into spot Bitcoin opportunistically, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of accumulation and revenue generation.  

This approach mirrors MicroStrategy's Bitcoin treasury playbook but adds a critical twist: TMTG's integration of Bitcoin into its Truth Social ecosystem. The company plans to launch a utility token for the platform, enabling users to transact in a crypto-native environment. This could drive user retention and monetization while reducing reliance on traditional advertising—a sector still grappling with algorithmic bias and political ad bans.  

TMTG's fintech arm, Truth.Fi, is a cornerstone of its anti-fragile strategy. With a $250 million investment allocation, the platform offers customized ETFs like the “Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus ETF” and the “U.S. Energy Independence ETF,” targeting sectors aligned with the Trump administration's economic vision. These products appeal to a growing base of investors disillusioned with ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) investing and traditional banking systems.  

The partnership with Charles Schwab and Yorkville Advisors adds credibility. Schwab's custodial expertise and Yorkville's advisory role ensure TMTG's fintech products meet institutional-grade compliance standards. Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act—signed into law in July 2025—creates a regulatory tailwind by legitimizing stablecoins and fostering U.S. dollar-backed digital assets. This legislation directly supports TMTG's plans to tokenize media assets and expand cross-border payment solutions.  

TMTG's anti-fragile model is defined by its ability to thrive in volatile environments. While the company posted a $20 million net loss in Q2 2025 (driven by $15 million in legal fees from its 2024 SPAC merger), it also achieved its first-ever positive operating cash flow of $2.3 million from media and technology operations. This diversification—spanning crypto treasury gains, fintech fees, and media content monetization—reduces single-point failure risks.  

The company's strategic acquisition fund, targeting $2.5 billion in stock purchases via Yorkville Advisors, further amplifies its flexibility. This capital can be deployed to acquire fintech startups, expand Truth.Fi's product suite, or accelerate Bitcoin accumulation. Notably, TMTG's balance sheet grew 800% year-over-year, reflecting a disciplined approach to liquidity management.  

TMTG's alignment with the Trump administration's pro-crypto agenda provides an additional layer of resilience. The GENIUS Act's emphasis on dollar-backed stablecoins complements TMTG's Truth.Fi offerings, while the administration's push for a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve reinforces institutional confidence in digital assets. These policies not only shield TMTG from regulatory headwinds but also position it as a beneficiary of federal-level crypto adoption.  

However, risks remain. TMTG's stock (ticker: DJT) has declined ~50% year-to-date, reflecting skepticism about its media growth and crypto volatility. A  chart would reveal a divergent trajectory, underscoring the need for investors to separate the company's media and fintech segments.  

For investors with a 3–5 year horizon, TMTG offers a compelling case. Its Bitcoin treasury acts as a hedge against inflation and financial deplatforming, while Truth.Fi taps into the $10 trillion ETF market. The company's “anti-fragile” business model—resilient in downturns and explosive in upturns—mirrors PayPal's early days, leveraging decentralized finance to disrupt legacy systems.  

Key metrics to monitor:- Bitcoin price action and TMTG's treasury valuation.- Adoption rates of Truth.Fi's ETFs and utility token.- Regulatory developments under the GENIUS Act.  

Risks to consider:- Regulatory shifts in crypto markets.- Execution risks in Truth.Fi's product launches.- Political volatility affecting TMTG's brand.  

Trump Media & Technology Group is not just a media company—it's a crypto-native fintech platform with a media-first strategy. Its Bitcoin treasury, fintech expansion, and alignment with U.S. policy create a unique value proposition in an increasingly fragmented financial landscape. For investors seeking exposure to the intersection of crypto and media, TMTG represents a high-conviction opportunity to build long-term wealth in an anti-fragile framework.

Bullish, the owner of the Bullish Exchange crypto platform, said it plans to raise as much as $629 million in its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange.

The company, which also owns CoinDesk, said it plans to sell 20.3 million ordinary shares with an expected price of $28-$31 per share. At the top end of range, the company would be valued at $4.2 billion, according to the number of outstanding shares mentioned in an amended F-1 document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. 

The move sees Bullish join a number of crypto firms entering public markets since President Donald Trump took office after a pro-crypto election campaign. Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, went public in June, as did Israeli social trading platform eToro. Industry majors including BitGo, Grayscale have filed for IPOs as well, while exchanges Kraken and OKX are also said to be mulling similar moves.

Funds managed by BlackRock and ARK Investment Management have shown interest in buying up to $200 million worth of shares at the IPO price, according to the amended F-1 document. The offerings' underwriters have the option to purchase an additional 3.045 million shares, depending on demand. 

The roadshow comes weeks after Cayman Islands-headquartered firm filed its initial F-1 registration with the SEC. The company, which plans to use the ticker ""BLSH,"" aims to use the IPO proceeds for general corporate purposes and potential future acquisitions.

Bullish runs an institutional trading platform providing spot and derivatives trading as well as liquidity services, according to its filing.

The company provided an net income estimate of between $106 million and $109 million for the second quarter. In the first quarter, it posted a $349 million loss after reporting profit of $80 million for all of 2024.

In the filing, Bullish says it holds more than $3 billion in liquid assets, including 24,000 bitcoin, 12,600 ether and over $418 million in cash and stablecoins. That total, the company said, also includes funds supplied to decentralized finance protocols, although the amounts “are not material” to the overall total.

The wave of IPOs comes after the Trump administration provided the industry a long-sought favorable regulatory climate. That includes the GENIUS Act being signed into law last month, and a series of legal actions brought during the previous administration against leading industry participants being dropped.

The improved regulatory climate has helped prices soar. Bitcoin BTC$115,310.58 is up more than 22% this year to trade around $115,000 while the broader market, measured through the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, has gained 32%.

UPDATE (Aug. 4, 14:28 UTC): Adds valuation in second paragraph, assets in final paragraph.

UPDATE (Aug. 4, 14:58 UTC): Adds Circle, eToro IPOs in third paragraph, regulatory background, crypt market performance in last two paragraphs.

Coinbase (COIN) has been downgraded to a sell rating by Compass Point, which also cut its year-end price target from $330 to $248, citing weaker-than-expected earnings and fading interest in crypto equities as key risks.

COIN is trading modestly higher on Monday at $316 following last week's earnings-related 18% plunge.



“While we remain constructive on the current crypto cycle, we expect a choppy 3Q alongside weak August/September seasonality and waning retail interest in crypto treasury stocks,” analysts wrote. “We also expect increasing stablecoin competition to weigh on both COIN and CRCL's valuations in 2H25.”



Coinbase missed expectations for second-quarter results, and early third-quarter trends aren't looking much better. Subscription and services revenue, a metric investors see as a reliable income stream, came in 8% below Wall Street estimates in Q2. The midpoint of the company's Q3 forecast is also 5% below consensus.



“‘Other S&S revenue' was a key contributor to COIN's 2Q/3Q miss,” Compass Point wrote, pointing to a sharp quarter-over-quarter decline in Coinbase One and other tech-related fees — segments many investors had hoped would drive long-term growth.



Compass Point's downgrade comes as the crypto market loses momentum despite broader stock markets recovering after last week's dip. Bitcoin BTC$115,310.58 and ethereum ETH$3,687.78 have struggled to gain ground, and retail investors appear to be pulling back from “TreasuryCo” stocks — companies holding large amounts of BTC or other cryptos on their balance sheets. This includes Coinbase and Strategy (MSTR), the latter of which recently slowed its bitcoin buying pace and shifted toward raising funds through preferred equity rather than stock offerings.



The analysts flagged that elevated leverage in crypto markets poses a further risk. July's rally was fueled by aggressive trading, but with open interest rebounding after a short dip in liquidations, a deeper sell-off could trigger another round of forced selling.



Valuation is also a concern. Despite the weak Q2 results, COIN shares rallied 56% from May to July. Compass Point warns that “COIN is still trading at 44x annualized 3Q25E Street EBITDA forecast,” which it believes is too high given headwinds in retail trading, competition from ETFs and DeFi, and limited near-term regulatory breakthroughs.



Compass Point was also doubtful the CLARITY Act — a bill seen as key to regulatory reform — would pass this year. “We're more skeptical towards a market structure bill passing this year,” the firm said, projecting movement in early 2026 instead.



Coinbase has floated the idea of offering stock trading to users, but analysts are unconvinced it will be a meaningful revenue stream, especially with competitors like Robinhood already far ahead.



“Under a backdrop of weak crypto performance, we see COIN's premium valuation compressing back towards its prior range,” the report concluded.

Crypto started the week steady with bitcoin BTC$115,310.58 and ether (ETH) stabilizing after volatile selloffs on Friday and Saturday driven by the worst spot ETF outflows in months.

Bitcoin ETFs saw nearly $1 billion in outflows across Thursday and Friday, causing the asset to drop to around $114,000 before a modest recovery. Ether followed with $152 million in outflows on Friday, snapping a nearly month-long streak of daily inflows and putting pressure on its rally.

This came as U.S. President Donald Trump levying fresh tariffs across Asia and Europe dampened the mood in the global market, with risky bets suffering.

“The dip was driven by concerns over Trump's tariff stance and the Fed's signal that it's not keen to cut rates soon. But opportunistic buyers are already stepping in before U.S. markets open, indicating the fear may be overdone,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, in a Monday note to CoinDesk. 

That opportunistic pattern is apparent in some charts. Bitcoin is holding near $114,500 in early Asia trading, while ether was sitting above $3,550 — both still within short-term support zones. 

Retail favorites XRP XRP$3.0727 and dogecoin DOGE$0.2074 rose as much as 5% to lead market gains on Monday, with Cardano's ADA (ADA), BNB (BNB) and Solana's SOL (SOL) rising over 3%.

Institutional depth also appears to be cushioning volatility, some opine.

“The rising presence of professional desks has brought deeper secondary liquidity,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus. 

“This would've been a far messier unwind in the pre-ETF era. Q4 will be an important quarter with the Fed fully back in play and the tariff-inflation spillover to start showing in the real economy, so we believe it's an opportune time to dial down risk exposure in expectation of a busy September and year-end,” Fan added.

Still, ETF buyers remain absent for now, and that's keeping broader sentiment tentative. Bitcoin still sat below the critical $118,000 breakout zone, and ether needs to jump above $3,500 to avoid triggering further systematic selling.

Outside crypto, the macro setup is providing a soft floor. U.S. equity futures are green, up 0.4%, after Friday's weak jobs report lifted expectations for a Fed pivot.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index erased early losses, Hong Kong tech stocks broke a 7-day losing streak, and Treasury yields inched up, with 10-year paper at 4.24%.

Oil drifted lower after OPEC plus wrapped up a wave of production hikes, while the dollar weakened slightly.

 BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF will get a boost from the SEC's decision to raise the limit for options contracts 10-fold, NYDIG's Greg Cipolaro said. 

BlackRock's market-dominating spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund may get bigger after the US Securities and Exchange Commission increased position limits for many Bitcoin funds, according to crypto financial services firm NYDIG.

The SEC on Tuesday increased the number of allowed options contracts from 25,000 to 250,000 “for all ETFs with options,” which includes the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) but not the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), NYDIG's global head of research, Greg Cipolaro, said in a report on Friday.

“The change is likely to widen the monstrous lead that IBIT already has over the other players, while it hobbles FBTC's position as the second-largest options player,” Cipolaro said.

IBIT has $85.5 billion in assets under management, four times as much as FBTC, the second-largest Bitcoin (BTC) ETF by assets with $21.35 billion, according to CoinGlass.

Cipolaro said the SEC's decision to raise options position limits on Bitcoin ETFs would likely suppress Bitcoin's volatility and lead to more spot demand.

“This change enables more aggressive implementation of options strategies, like covered call selling,” he said, where traders sell a call option while owning the underlying asset, which limits downside risk but also the amount gained from the trade.

Cipolaro added that less volatility makes Bitcoin “appealing on a risk-parity basis, potentially drawing in new capital” from institutional portfolios looking for exposure to balanced risks.

“The feedback loop of falling volatility leading to increased spot buying could become a powerful driver of sustained demand,” he said.

The SEC went ahead with a slew of various ETF-related regulatory approvals on Tuesday, most notably approving in-kind creation and redemption on crypto ETFs, allowing the exchange of shares for the underlying crypto instead of cash.

Cipolaro said this was a “key feature” ETF issuers had wanted before their products were approved, and now that it is, it will “have important impacts on market structure and investor access.”

He added that Authorized Participants (APs) — financial institutions that manage the creation and redemption of ETF shares — which don't have crypto capabilities “will likely not be able to take advantage of arbitrage activities and offer competitive pricing.”

“There are only two APs today, Jane Street and Virtu, that also have corresponding crypto entities that can trade both sides of the trade,” Cipolaro said, “We expect broker-dealers (APs) that don't have crypto capabilities to acquire or partner to keep up.”

 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission will work with the Securities and Exchange Commission to implement White House crypto recommendations. 

The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has launched a “crypto sprint” to begin implementing crypto-related recommendations the Trump administration released on Wednesday.

CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham said on Friday that the agency would “work closely” with Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce on its “Project Crypto” initiative announced on Thursday.

“The CFTC is wasting no time in fulfilling President Trump's vision to make America the crypto capital of the world,” Pham said.

The initiatives are to implement agency-specific recommendations that US President Donald Trump's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets made in a report that stemmed from Trump's sweeping crypto-related executive order in January.

The President's Working Group made 18 recommendations to the CFTC, two of which directly concerned the agency.

The first direct request to the CFTC was to advance a host of initiatives, including guidance on how cryptocurrencies could be considered commodities, how its registration requirements would work with decentralized finance and guidance to CFTC-regulated entities on what they can do with crypto.

The other standalone task for the agency was to consider how to amend rules to accommodate blockchain-based derivatives.

An additional 16 recommendations concerning the CFTC were tied up with other financial agencies, such as the SEC and the Treasury.

Some recommendations the CFTC and SEC were told to work on jointly include coordinating to create a rulemaking process and using “their existing authorities to provide fulsome regulatory clarity.”

The two agencies were also told they should create a regulatory sandbox and, longer term, explore how to allow registrants to “offer multiple services within a single user interface.”

Related: White House crypto report a mixed bag for Bitcoin advocates

Several recommendations tasked Congress with carving out how the CFTC and SEC should divvy up regulating crypto, with the report saying the CFTC should be given “clear authority to regulate spot markets in non-security digital assets.”

In a statement on Friday, Pham said the CFTC has already begun working to “deliver on the Administration's promise to usher in a Golden Age of Crypto.”

The agency met with crypto executives earlier this year to discuss the industry and has withdrawn what it called “outdated staff advisories” relating to crypto.

It also recently wrapped up consultations on allowing 24/7 derivatives trading and perpetual contracts, a move backed by some crypto companies.

Trump has nominated Brian Quintenz, the global head of policy at Andreessen Horowitz's crypto venture firm, to lead the CFTC.

He is awaiting a nomination hearing, which was slated to take place on Wednesday, but the Senate Agriculture Committee pulled it on request from the White House.

 Ether “mega whales” continued buying the cryptocurrency, which dipped and began recovering over the weekend. 

Ether whales continued to buy the cryptocurrency in droves, according to onchain analysts, as ETH recovers from a weekend dip. 

“Somebody is buying a ton of ETH,” blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence said on Sunday, with one address accumulating $300 million worth of Ether (ETH) from over-the-counter (OTC) trading at Galaxy Digital.

The whale address currently holds 79,461 ETH, worth around $282.5 million. 

BlackRock has also been loading up on ETH, with the firm's iShares Ethereum Trust ETF seeing $1.7 billion in inflows over the past 10 consecutive trading days.

Onchain holdings of Ether in exchange-traded funds have gone vertical over the past month, surging by more than 40% over the past 30 days, according to Dune Analytics.

The Ether “mega whale” address count has also surged over the past 30 days, according to Glassnode. 

The mega whale cohort is defined by addresses holding more than 10,000 ETH, with more than 200 added since the beginning of July. 

These whale address counts include those held by exchanges, large custodians and exchange-traded products, which have been aggressively accumulating. 

Ether prices cooled off over the weekend with a dip below $3,400, but showed signs of recovery on Monday by reclaiming $3,560.

“While the labor market's cooling trend initially spooked investors, the heightened likelihood of monetary easing could soon reverse the sell-off, offering crypto a bullish tailwind as liquidity expectations shift,” director of strategic partnerships at the CoinW exchange, Monika Mlodzianowska, told Cointelegraph. 

Similar to Bitcoin, which has been bearish in eight out of the past 12 months of August, Ether has seen losses over the past three years in August.

The asset fell by double digits in August 2023 and 2024, but surged a whopping 35.6% during August 2021, which was a bull market year, according to CoinGlass. 

Over the weekend, Eric Trump, the son of US President Donald Trump, told his X followers to buy the ETH dip.

Meanwhile, CNBC labelled Ethereum “Wall Street's invisible backbone” in an article on Saturday.

 Prior to the proposal passing, Cardano's Technical Steering Committee submitted a competing bid and users expressed concern about transparency and accountability. 

Cardano's core development team received approval to be paid 96 million ADA from the treasury to forge ahead with proposed upgrades to the network.

Input Output Global (IOG) — Cardano's main development team — submitted the proposal for the equivalent of $71 million in Cardano (ADA), which passed with 74% in favor, representing 200 votes, with six against and seven abstaining, according to the governance action.

The 12-month development plan focuses on improving scalability, the developer experience and interoperability.

Still, it drew some concern from the community over costs, overall accountability and transparency.

Funding will be milestone-based, with Cardano member-based organization Intersect acting as an independent administrator. 

Payments will be released as upgrades are delivered, with other oversight via smart contracts and a dedicated committee, according to IOG.

IOG must publish monthly updates, engineering timesheets and quarterly budget breakdowns.

Some of the key projects in the IOG proposal include Hydra, a protocol for fast, low-cost transactions, and Project Acropolis, a modular re-architecture of the Cardano node for greater flexibility and easier onboarding of new core developers.

Cardano's average transaction cost is currently 0.34 ADA, according to blockchain research firm Messari, with an average of 20 seconds per block.

In addition, IOG is looking to lower RAM usage and reduce operational costs for stake pool operators through performance optimizations and to implement technical foundations for more advanced smart contracts and seamless interoperability.

Tim Harrison, the vice president of community and ecosystem at IOG, said in a statement on Saturday that this was the first time the community had directly authorized core development funding for Cardano.

Prior to the vote, some community members voiced concerns about the funding cost, transparency on how the funds would be spent and accountability for delivering what was promised.

Some also questioned whether the proposal should be broken down into smaller goals with separate budgets requiring individual votes on each item.

There was a competing proposal from Cardano's Technical Steering Committee (TSC), which was ultimately not endorsed by Intersect. 

Adam Rusch, a member of Intersect's board of directors, said in an April 28 post to X that the community should decide which proposal to support.

Cardano isn't the only blockchain working on upgrades this year. 

The Solana network increased its block capacity by 20% on July 22, raising the limit to 60 million compute units (CU) with plans for further expansion before the end of the year.

Ethereum's gas limit was increased to just under 44.92 million on July 22, according to Ycharts. A higher gas limit allows Ethereum to process more transactions per block. 

Also, Ethereum's Pectra hard fork went live on May 7, increasing the number of data blobs per block and the validator staking limit, among other upgrades. The next upgrade, Fusaka, is scheduled for the end of 2025.

Some Mathematicians Don't Believe in Infinity

Can “finitism” possibly describe the real world?

By Manon Bischoff edited by Daisy Yuhas

Eugene Mymrin/Getty Images

One question has preoccupied humankind for thousands of years: Do infinities exist? More than 2,300 years ago Aristotle distinguished between two types of infinity: potential and actual. The former deals with abstract scenarios that would result from repeated processes. For example, if you were asked to imagine counting forever, adding 1 to the previous number, over and over again, this situation, in Aristotle's view, would involve potential infinity. But actual infinities, the scholar argued, could not exist.

Most mathematicians gave infinities a wide berth until the end of the 19th century. They were unsure of how to deal with these strange quantities. What results in infinity plus 1—or infinity times infinity? Then the German mathematician Georg Cantor put an end to these doubts. With set theory, he established the first mathematical theory that made it possible to deal with the immeasurable. Since then infinities have been an integral part of mathematics. At school, we learn about the sets of natural or real numbers, each of which is infinitely large, and we encounter irrational numbers, such as pi and the square root of 2, which have an infinite number of decimal places.

Yet there are some people, so-called finitists, who reject infinity to this day. Because everything in our universe—including the resources to calculate things—seems to be limited, it makes no sense to them to calculate with infinities. And indeed, some experts have proposed an alternative branch of mathematics that relies only on finitely constructible quantities. Some are now even trying to apply these ideas to physics in the hope of finding better theories to describe our world.

Modern mathematics is based on set theory, which, as the name suggests, revolves around groupings or sets. You can think of a set as a bag into which you can put all kinds of things: numbers, functions or other entities. By comparing the contents of different bags, their size can be determined. So if I want to know whether one bag is fuller than another, I take out objects one at a time from each bag at the same time and see which empties first.

That concept doesn't sound particularly surprising. Even small children can grasp the basic principle. But Cantor realized that infinitely large quantities can be compared in this way. Using set theory, he came to the conclusion that there are infinities of different sizes. Infinity is not always the same as infinity; some infinities are larger than others.

Mathematicians Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel used set theory to give mathematics a foundation at the beginning of the 20th century. Before then subfields such as geometry, analysis, algebra and stochastics were largely in isolation from each other. Fraenkel and Zermelo formulated nine basic rules, known as axioms, on which the entire subject of mathematics is now based.

One such axiom, for example, is the existence of the empty set: mathematicians assume that there is a set that contains nothing; an empty bag. Nobody questions this idea. But another axiom ensures that infinitely large sets also exist, which is where finitists draw a line. They want to build a mathematics that gets by without this axiom, a finite mathematics.

Finitists reject infinities not only because of the finite resources available to us in the real world. They are also bothered by counterintuitive results that can be derived from set theory. For example, according to the Banach-Tarski paradox, you can disassemble a sphere and then reassemble it into two spheres, each of which is as large as the original. From a mathematical point of view, it is no problem to double a sphere—but in reality, it is not possible.

If the nine axioms allow such results, finitists argue, then something is wrong with the axioms. Because most of the axioms are seemingly intuitive and obvious, the finitists only reject the one that, in their view, contradicts common sense: the axiom on infinite sets.

Their view can be expressed as follows: “a mathematical object only exists if it can be constructed from the natural numbers with a finite number of steps.” Irrational numbers, despite being reached with clear formulas, such as the square root of 2, consist of infinite sums and therefore cannot be part of finite mathematics.

As a result, some logical principles no longer apply, including Aristotle's theorem of the excluded middle, according to which a mathematical statement is always either true or false. In finitism, a statement can be indeterminate at a certain point in time if the value of a number has not yet been determined. For example, with statements that revolve around numbers such as 0.999..., if you carry out the full period and consider an infinite number of 9's, the answer becomes 1. But if there is no infinity, this statement is simply wrong.

Without the theorem of the excluded middle, all kinds of difficulties arise. In fact, many mathematical proofs are based on this very principle. It is no surprise, then, that only a few mathematicians have dedicated themselves to finitism. Rejecting infinities makes mathematics more complicated.

And yet there are physicists who follow this philosophy, including Nicolas Gisin of the University of Geneva. He hopes that a finite world of numbers could describe our universe better than current modern mathematics. He bases his considerations on the idea that space and time can only contain a limited amount of information. Accordingly, it makes no sense to calculate with infinitely long or infinitely large numbers because there is no room for them in the universe.

This effort has not yet progressed far. Nevertheless, I find it exciting. After all, physics seems to be stuck: the most fundamental questions about our universe, such as how it came into being or how the fundamental forces connect, have yet to be answered. Finding a different mathematical starting point could be worth a try. Moreover, it is fascinating to explore how far you can get in mathematics if you change or omit some basic assumptions. Who knows what surprises lurk in the finite realm of mathematics?

In the end, it boils down to a question of faith: Do you believe in infinities or not? Everyone has to answer that for themselves.

JWST Spots Ancient Light That Shouldn't Exist

JWST observations of light sources before the first galaxies should have formed are raising new questions about our galactic origins

By Conor Feehly edited by Clara Moskowitz

Since its launch in late 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has been glimpsing some of the earliest epochs of cosmic time. Its observations have stretched cosmologists' timelines of when galaxies may have first started to form. And now some of the telescope's farthest observations yet have revealed sources of blue ultraviolet light from an epoch when stars shouldn't have existed yet.

The observations indicate nine new light sources, with six at redshift 17 and three at redshift 25, when the universe was only 200 million to 100 million years old. “It's the deepest by a factor of a few compared to any other data obtained by JWST in the whole mission,” says Pablo G. Pérez-González, an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrobiology in Madrid. He is lead author of a preprint paper reporting the findings that has been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal.

“If we confirm that they are truly at those redshifts, the universe was much, much more active its first 200 million years” than astronomers had thought, Pérez-González says.

If accurate, the newly sighted objects don't merely expand the timeline of galaxy formation back to a much earlier period; they sit in direct conflict with astronomers' best cosmological models of when stars began to form during the cosmic dawn. For this reason, another group of astronomers have put forward a hypothesis to make sense of these puzzling findings. They have proposed that “primordial” black holes created right after the big bang may have lit up the universe before the first stars. Their preprint paper has been accepted for publication in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.

""If stars cannot explain the source of the luminosity and the numbers that we see, something else should be producing the light,” says Andrea Ferrara, an astrophysicist at the Superior Normal School (SNS) in Pisa, Italy, and co-author of the first paper. “This can only be a primordial black hole.”

In other words, it's possible that the first objects to bathe the early universe in light were not stars but rather hungry black holes that burst into existence mere seconds after the big bang itself.

The farther we peer out to our cosmic horizons, the further back in time we see. And because the universe itself is expanding, light traveling from extremely distant sources has stretched its wavelength all the way to the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This phenomenon is what astrophysicists refer to as redshift. The higher the redshift of a distant object is, therefore, the further back in time you are looking.

Before JWST, the highest confirmed redshifted galaxy astronomers had observed was at redshift 9, when the universe was 600 million to 500 million years old. For the first couple of years after its launch, JWST spent a significant amount of its time confirming previously identified galaxies that had been observed by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

Variables such as the concentration of dark matter—an invisible gravitational source that outweighs visible matter in the universe by six to one—and the necessary conditions needed for star formation provide cosmologists with constraints to determine a rough timeline for the evolution of galaxies in the early universe. But after the summer of 2022, as JWST began revealing galactic candidates at earlier epochs, astronomers started to realize something wasn't quite making sense.

“JWST is finding too many too massive galaxies too early in the universe,” says astrophysicist Allison Kirkpatrick of the University of Kansas, who specializes in galaxy evolution and was not involved in the new studies.

To date, the oldest confirmed galaxies observed by JWST are at redshift 14, when the universe was only 300 million years old. “So the idea here was to go beyond that, to redshift 15 and beyond,” Pérez-González says, ""in search of the very first galaxies ever formed.”

His team's report of nine new objects at even higher redshifts will need confirmation. To determine whether the objects are as far as they seem to be, astronomers must break up their light into specific wavelengths in a process called spectroscopy.

Drawing on data collected by JWST's Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) over two imaging surveys, Pérez-González and his team identified the new candidate galaxies from a pool of more than 80,000. After imaging a region of the sky with different filters for more than 100 hours, the astronomers were able to identify galaxies at different brightnesses and select the most promising candidates for further observation. Casting a wide net means their sample is less likely to be biased before they zoom in on the most interesting distant objects.

The suspected galaxies Pérez-González and his team found shine with bright blue light in the ultraviolet range of the spectrum—exactly the light astronomers believe the massive first stars would have produced. The problem with this scenario, however, is that galaxy evolution models have an extremely tough time producing stars at such early stages of the universe's development. It's doubtful that this time frame would have allowed enough time for gas to cool and gather into clouds large enough to gravitationally collapse into the first generation of stars.

“Galaxies cannot form quickly because the gas in the early universe is very hot, preventing it from collapsing into galaxies and stars,” Kirkpatrick says. “Instead dark matter structure grows first, and the immense gravity funnels gas to the center to grow the first stars and galaxies. This all takes time, more time than 100 million years.”

To get around this problem, Ferrara and his collaborators propose that primordial black holes—a distinct population of black holes that may have emerged in the first few seconds after the big bang—were consuming gas in the early universe. This feeding frenzy could have released light that we are now detecting with JWST at periods before the first stars formed. Bizarrely, black holes, not stars, might have been the first significant sources of light in the early universe.

Typically, black holes form when massive stars collapse after they run out of fuel or when a large cloud of gas directly collapses in on itself, bypassing the stellar phase. Primordial black holes, however, are different. “What we are proposing is that primordial black holes formed less than one second to five seconds after the big bang,” Ferrara says. “These have been essentially there forever, from the beginning.”

Initially, these black holes would have started out small, “no larger than the size of an atom,” Kirkpatrick says. Scientists think that within the first second of the universe as we know it bursting into existence, a rapid period of expansion, known as inflation, caused space to increase in size by 35 orders of magnitude, equivalent to an atom stretching to the size of the solar system. “This has a lot of consequences, including the creation of very small black holes,” Kirkpatrick says. Although starting out tiny, after 100 million years, these black holes may have swelled to 10,000 times the mass of the sun, Ferrara and his team suspect.

When gas gets near a black hole, it gets heated to scorching temperatures, and this superheated matter emits light. From a distance, it might look similar to the atmosphere of a star. For this reason, the difference between the primordial black hole explanation and the stellar explanation, based on the current imaging data, is nearly impossible to disentangle. But there may be other clues.

One way to distinguish if these light sources are primordial black holes or first-generation stars would be to look at the sizes of galaxies. If they appear more pointlike, then the primordial black hole explanation would make more sense because a massive black hole is still tiny compared with a whole galaxy. But if the light sources are diffuse and extended, then they might be more likely to be stars.

""So we measured the sizes, and some of the candidates are, to the best of our knowledge with the data that we have, pointlike but not all of them. Some of them are extended. So maybe 30 percent of them are consistent with what a primordial black hole might look like,"" Pérez-González says.

Right now the data are hardly definitive. Because primordial black holes have hypothetically been around since the very beginning of the universe, they should also leave traces in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), a snapshot of the universe as it existed 380,000 years after the big bang. “Our pictures of the CMB maps are still a little bit too blurred in order to see the fine-structure details that primordial black holes may have introduced,” Ferrara says.

For now, a definitive answer is just beyond reach. The possible presence of primordial black holes may, however, make sense of another cosmological conundrum: the existence of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies at early epochs. “We haven't yet proved how the first supermassive black hole seeds form, and this could be one pathway. It would help resolve some of the tension with JWST observations and cosmological models,” Kirkpatrick says.

“These observations are difficult, and we are pushing the JWST to its limit,” Ferrara says. “We have to be careful because maybe these galaxies could turn out to be contaminants or lower-redshift galaxies or something else.” But whether these mysterious black beacons outshone the first stars is a question we may soon have an answer to.

Russian Volcano, Dormant for Hundreds of Years, Erupts after Massive Nearby Quake

The Krasheninnikov volcano, located less than 150 miles away from the epicenter of Russia's July 29 earthquake, began erupting on August 3

By Meghan Bartels edited by Dean Visser

A massive column of ash erupts from the Krasheninnikov volcano in Russia's eastern Kamchatka region, marking its first eruption since 1550, according to the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program, on August 3, 2025. The eruption comes just days after one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded in the region.

Russia's Krasheninnikov volcano erupted for the first time in centuries on August 3, sending ash and gas nearly four miles into the atmosphere—less than 150 miles away from the epicenter of the magnitude 8.8 earthquake that struck on July 29.

The mountain is one of eight active volcanoes in the Kronotsky Nature Reserve and part of the Eastern Kamchatka Volcanic Arc. The eruption began around 6 A.M. local time on Sunday (2 P.M. EDT on August 2), when personnel in the area noticed ash, steam and gas escaping from the slopes of the volcano, according to a Russian-language statement posted on the nature reserve's website.

The volcano is located on the sparsely populated Kamchatka Peninsula, just across the international date line from Alaska's Aleutian Islands. Because of its remote location, the volcano presents little threat to humans. Scientists have cataloged 31 previous confirmed eruptions of Krasheninnikov throughout the current Holocene epoch, which began about 11,700 years ago. Its most recent known eruption occurred around 1550, according to the Smithsonian Institution‘s Global Volcanism Program.

Large earthquakes do occasionally trigger nearby volcanic eruptions, according to the U.S. Geological Survey—but only if the volcano is already nearing an eruption, with enough magma stored inside of it undergoing high enough pressure.

Another volcano in the same arc, Klyuchevskoy, is also currently erupting. Scientists watched lava fill the crater beginning in April and confirmed large amounts of fresh lava there on July 19, before the massive earthquake. This volcano has historically been much more active than Krasheninnikov, with more than 111 Holocene eruptions identified by scientists, including more than a dozen in the past two decades.

New research shows that entangled particles can pass on their shared state again and again and again.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Superposition and entanglement together form the foundation of quantum computing. The former describes how qubits—the building blocks of quantum computers—can be in multiple states (in this case, 0 or 1) until measured, and the latter links qubits together so that they share the same fate, no matter the distance between them. Being able to form entanglement between particles is crucial, as this is what allows the separate qubits to function as a system. 

Creating entangled pairs is an inherently fragile process, so scientists from the Harish-Chandra Research Institute in India and the Université libre de Bruxelles in Belgium wondered if there was another way to create entangled pairs rather than just from scratch. In a study published in the journal Physical Review A, the researchers walk through how an entangled qubit pair named Alice and Bob (the common couple name used for quantum thought experiments) can actually share their entangled state with a second quantum pair (named Charu and Debu). In fact, the entangled state can be transferred to an indefinite number of quantum pairs. 

“We find joint unitaries which, when applied by Alice and a Charu, and by Bob and the corresponding Debu, can transfer entanglement from the Alice-Bob pair to an indefinite number of pairs of Charus and Debus,” the authors wrote. “Given the valuable role played by the costly resource, entanglement, in quantum information processing and communication, we expect that our results will have significant impact in quantum technologies.”

This means that while Charu and Debu can't form an entangled pair on their own, they can tap into the same “entanglement bank” with particles that communicated with the other entangled pair—Alice to Charu, and Bob to Debu. 

“We thought of a scenario where someone, like money or sweets, has a lot of it and is willing to share it with children or subordinates or just some others,” Harish-Chandra Research Institute's Ujjwal Sen told New Scientist.

This metaphor is an apt one, as the original entangled pair isn't keen to give away all of its “sweets”—or, in this case, its entangled state. When entanglement passes to Charu and Debu, the pair receives a slightly smaller amount. This means that while this entanglement sharing could theoretically go on forever, it does eventually stop, because the amount of entanglement is no longer useful. 

While quantum computers have made slow-yet-steady progress in the last decade, their computational promise still remains out of reach—largely due to the finicky nature of qubits, as noise (thermal or otherwise) causes them to decohere. Any process that can increase methods of entanglement, which can improve a quantum computer's error correction, is a welcomed one.

They uncovered an entire street of production-focused buildings.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The ancient Roman city of Suasa may have contained one of Italy's first—and largest—arts districts. Archaeologists uncovered what they deem a “large production district” that spanned a main street just outside the city center and featured buildings once used for the creation of coins and pottery dipping 16 feet into the ground. 

The team from the University of Bologna said in a translated statement that they discovered an “extraordinary quantity of coins and some nearly intact vases” among the excavated ruins, showing off the prominence of the district in an array of production mediums that may have been traded throughout the Roman Empire.  

Suasa, which was located near the Cesano River, was founded after the Battle of Sentinum in 295 B.C.—a conflict fought between the Roman army and the Picentes against the alliance of Etruscans, Samnites, Senones Gauls, and Umbrians. The Roman victory gave the empire control over central Italy, and Suasa became an administrative center that grew in importance thanks to the well-connected Via Flaminia and Via Salaria Gallica roads passing through. 

The rapid growth of Suasa continued into the second half of the first century B.C. The city remained linked to Rome, but with an autonomous government and magistrates that led the building of the city, which included a variety of monumental structures. 

In the ancient city center, past University of Bologna archaeological missions uncovered a mixture of finds, including a commercial forum, a square, a portico, and a mid-Imperial period Domus—an upper-class Roman residence—full of mosaics and wall paintings. Teams then found an amphitheater, considered the largest in the region, and another theater nearby. As work continued, archaeologists at the western world's oldest continuous university located a necropolis. 

“The goal of this year's research was to investigate the city's boundaries to better understand the transition between the settlement and the necropolis,” Enrico Giorgi, professor in the Department of History, Cultures, and Civilizations at the University of Bologna and director of the archaeological mission, said in a statement. 

At the outermost area of that site—between the main settlement and the burial site—the most recent excavations revealed the “large production district.” The research team began with drone photography and geophysical surveys before moving into the excavation that uncovered the structures, coins, and vases. 

University experts said that Suasa retained its important role as an administrative and economic center in central Italy for some time, with peak development occuring during the second century A.D. Signs of decline appeared in the second half of the third century A.D., and the city was slowly emptied until completely abandoned sometime in the sixth century A.D., as newer settlements retreated to the hill country. It seems that those leaving the city didn't take their coins and vases with them.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are a group of cancers that affect cells in and around our mouth and nose. With 890,000 new cases and 450,000 deaths annually, HNSCC accounts for roughly 4.5% of cancer diagnoses and deaths worldwide. Treatment options for HNSCC are very limited, so nearly half of affected patients with HNSCC die from the disease. Current therapies consist of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which can be effective but often have limited success and significant side effects.

To meet this unmet medical need, researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine are exploring new approaches to improve the effectiveness of treatments for HNSCC. In a new study of oral cancer, a type of HNSCC, they demonstrate how precisely timing two different treatments can potentially improve treatment outcomes by protecting tumor-draining lymph nodes, which are located close to tumors and have an important role in mediating the immune system's response to the tumor.

The researchers found:

The study's results could have significant implications for the treatment of HNSCC, as well as other cancers that are resistant or unresponsive to current standard treatment approaches. The research also provides valuable biological insight into the role of tumor-draining lymph nodes in cancer biology, which could have further implications for developing new therapies. While it will take further research to fully explore the potential of this timed treatment approach, the findings demonstrate the importance of optimizing the sequence and timing of therapies to maximize their benefit to the patient. The researchers are now conducting clinical trials in collaboration with investigators at Providence Earl Chiles Cancer Center to leverage these strategies to improve outcomes in head and neck cancer patients.

The study, published in Nature Communications, was led by Robert Saddawi-Konefka, M.D., Ph.D.,PGY-8, resident physician and Joseph Califano, M.D., professor and interim chair in the Department of Otolaryngology and Iris and Matthew Strauss Chancellor's Endowed Chair in Head and Neck Surgery at UC San Diego School of Medicine. Califano is also director of the Hanna and Mark Gleiberman Head and Neck Cancer Center at Moore's Cancer Center. The study was supported, in part by a National Cancer Institute funded R01 grant led by. Califano and Andrew Sharabi, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor and Jacobs Chancellor's Endowed Chair in the Department of Radiation Medicine and Applied Sciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine, as well as a member of the Head and Neck Cancer Center at Moores Cancer Center. The authors declare no competing interests.

The project used ancient DNA and microscopic techniques to sample faeces dating back more than 1500 years, with nine of 16 original parasite taxa disappearing prior to the 1990s, when the endangered parrot came under full-population management, and an additional four recorded as lost in the period since.

""Despite their sometimes negative portrayal, parasites are increasingly appreciated for their ecological importance,"" says the University of Adelaide's Dr Jamie Wood, who contributed to the study published in Current Biology.

""Parasites are among the planet's most ubiquitous, successful, and species-rich groups of organisms, and nearly all free-living species harbor some parasites. They may help with immune system development and compete to exclude foreign parasites that may be more harmful to their hosts.""

""However, the dependence of parasites on living hosts may make them susceptible to extinction, especially as many parasites live with just one host species.""

An extinction of a parasite that occurs in tandem with its host is known as a secondary extinction or a coextinction, and it often happens at a faster rate than for the host animal.

""Predictive models indicate that parasites may go extinct before their hosts during the coextinction process as opportunities to transmit between host individuals diminish,"" says Dr Wood.

""As a result, faunal declines may have a lasting impact on parasite communities, even if host populations eventually recover.

""Dependent species, like parasites, are rarely preserved or documented prior to their extinction, and so until now we have had few data to indicate the actual scale of the coextinction process.

""Our new research indicates that parasite extinctions may be far more prevalent than previous estimates suggest, with unknown impacts on their hosts and their ecosystems.""

Lead author Alexander Boast, from Manaaki Whenua-Landcare Research, was surprised at the degree of parasite loss.

""The level of parasite loss in kākāpō was greater than we had expected, and very few parasite species were found in both ancient and modern kākāpō populations. Thus, it seems that endangered species everywhere may possess fractions of their original parasite communities,"" he says.

As we reckon with the impacts of biodiversity loss, Dr Wood says due attention should also be given to parasitic life.

""Global rates of climate change, ecosystem modification, and biodiversity decline continue to rise, which means there is an increasingly urgent need to recognize and understand the downstream impacts on dependent species, such as parasites, mutualists, or predators,"" he says.

""Documenting parasite extinction, how quickly it can unfold, and estimating the number of presently threatened parasites are key first steps toward a ""global parasite conservation plan"" and supporting informed predictions for past, present, and future parasite losses.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","These butterflies look the same, but DNA uncovered six hidden species","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250803233109.htm","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 12:29:09 GMT","

Some butterflies can smell others of the same species, allowing them to identify each other in areas where multiple species all look the same, new research finds.

A large international team has genetically mapped glasswing butterflies found across Central and South America, rewriting the evolutionary tree and highlighting six new species.

The team includes experts at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Universidad Regional Amazónica Ikiam in Ecuador, Universidade Estadual de Campinas in Brazil, the University of Cambridge, and others.

The research, published on July 28 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), starts to uncover new insights about these butterflies as well as factors involved in the rapid diversification of species and why some species are more capable of this. The findings help experts to understand more about how has life evolved until now and possibly suggest how it might change in the future.

For example, researchers found that in glasswing butterflies, even the most closely related species produce different pheromones, indicating that they can smell others of the same species. Given that all of these butterflies look the same to teach birds that they are all toxic, this allows the butterflies to find a compatible mate.

By untangling the taxonomy of these butterflies, the team provides answers to questions that have remained unknown for at least 150 years. The researchers also present ten freely available reference genomes that can help to monitor and maintain insect populations in some of the most biodiverse areas of the world.

Butterflies are used in conservation as an indicator species, meaning they are used to track and monitor the levels of biodiversity and other insects in an area.

Glasswing (Ithomiine) butterflies are found across Central and South America and make up a substantial part of the butterfly species found there, making them good indicators of biodiversity in incredibly biodiverse areas, like the Amazon rainforest.

However, there are over 400 species of glasswing butterfly, and all species in an area look incredibly similar to discourage birds from eating them, with coloring that implies they are toxic.

Additionally, glasswing butterflies can undergo rapid radiation, where many new species arise from the same ancestor in a short period of time. As they are very closely related, it makes it difficult to visually identify and track the different species of butterflies.

To genetically untangle these butterflies, an international team including Sanger Institute scientists sequenced the genomes of almost all species of two particularly fast radiations of glasswing butterflies to remap their evolutionary trees. Of those species, 10 were sequenced to the gold standard of ""reference quality"" genomes that are freely available to the research community.

By genetically mapping these butterflies, the team highlighted that six subspecies were more genetically distinct than previously thought, leading to them being classified as new individual species. Also, understanding the species from a genomic perspective enables experts to highlight any visual differences that could be used to identify and track the different species, now that they are confirmed as genetically distinct.

The team also investigated if the genomes held clues as to why these butterflies had so many species, and what allowed them to develop so quickly. While most butterflies have 31 chromosomes, they found that in these glasswing butterflies, the number of chromosomes varies a lot, ranging between 13 and 28. While they have largely the same genes, these genes are packaged into chromosomes in different ways in each species, a process known as chromosomal rearrangement.

These chromosomal rearrangements have knock-on effects when it comes to mating. In order to reproduce, butterflies must produce eggs and sperm, but this relies on the butterfly's chromosomes lining up. This means that if two butterflies with different chromosomal rearrangements mated, their offspring would be sterile because they would be unable to produce sperm or eggs. As a result, the butterflies have evolved a new mechanism using pheromones to detect potential mates with a chromosome arrangement that matches their own and therefore avoid producing sterile offspring.

The researchers suggest that the high level of chromosomal rearrangement in these butterflies is key to their ability to rapidly form new species, as once a population changes its chromosome number and thus forms its own species, it can more quickly adapt to different altitudes or host plants. Why they have such high levels of rearrangements remains a mystery and is something the scientists are working to uncover.

Understanding rapid radiation in insects could have implications for conservation research, understanding how species adapt to climate change, as well as possible implications for agriculture and pest control.

Dr Eva van der Heijden, first author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the University of Cambridge, said: ""Glasswing butterflies are an incredibly adaptive group of insects that have been valuable in ecology research for around 150 years. However, until now, there was no genetic resource that allowed us to robustly identify different species, and it is difficult to monitor and track something that you can't identify easily. With this new genetically informed evolutionary tree, and multiple new reference genomes, we hope that it will be possible to advance biodiversity and conservation research around the world, and help protect the butterflies and other insects that are crucial to many of Earth's ecosystems.""

Dr Caroline Bacquet, senior author at the Universidad Regional Amazónica Ikiam in Ecuador, said: ""Having the reference genomes for the two groups of glasswing butterflies, Mechanitis and Melinaea, allowed us to take a closer look at how they have adapted to life in such close proximity to their relatives. These butterflies share the responsibility of warding off predators by displaying similar colour patterns, and by producing different pheromones they can successfully find mates and reproduce. Now that we have clarity on glasswing butterfly species, we can look for specific markings or differences between them, giving new ways to track them during fieldwork.""

Dr Joana Meier, senior author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: ""We are in the middle of an extinction crisis and understanding how new species evolve, and evolve quickly in some cases, is important for preserving species. Comparing butterflies that rapidly form new species to others that do not could benchmark how common this is in insects and highlight the factors involved. This, in turn, could identify any species that require closer conservation and possibly identify genes that are important in the adaptation process and might have uses in agriculture, medicine, or bioengineering. This research would not have been possible without global collaboration. We have one planet, and we must work together to understand and protect it.""

This study was made possible by a large international collaboration.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Lupus often fades with age. Scientists finally know why","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250803233101.htm","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 08:47:21 GMT","

Lupus is a ""classic"" autoimmune disease.

It causes the immune system's first-line viral defenses -- known as interferons -- to attack the body. Nearly every organ is at risk, leading to conditions like kidney and heart disease.

But unlike many other autoimmune or chronic illnesses, lupus can improve as patients reach their 60s and 70s.

""I see my younger lupus patients in their 20s, 30s, and 40s every few months, monitoring them closely for signs of severe disease, but many of my older patients just once a year to touch base,"" said Sarah Patterson, MD, assistant professor of medicine in the division of rheumatology at UCSF. ""If patients make it through those risky decades, they sometimes see a dramatic improvement.""

Now, Patterson and colleagues have published a study in Science Translational Medicine that reveals how this works.

By analyzing blood samples from patients across the age spectrum, the team discovered that aging turns down the activity of certain immune genes in people with lupus, leading to fewer interferons and other inflammatory proteins in the body.

The study found that in healthy adults, inflammation-related genes and proteins rose slowly over the years, a process that has been dubbed ""inflammaging."" In patients with lupus, however, the expression of these genes and proteins were abnormally high in mid-life but decreased as the decades went by.

""Inflammaging seemed to be reversed in the lupus patients,"" said Chaz Langelier, MD, PhD, associate professor of medicine at UCSF and senior author of the paper. ""But it wasn't fully reversed. The lupus patients still had a greater level of inflammatory signaling compared to healthy adults in older age.""

That reversal reflected what Patterson has seen in her patients -- a return to something approaching healthy older age.

Next, the team intends to test whether drugs that block interferons are more or less effective in lupus patients at different ages. They also hope to extend the approach to understand other inflammation-related conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, COPD, and atherosclerosis.

Rich with detail, the spiral galaxy NGC 1309 shines in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope Picture of the Week. NGC 1309 is situated about 100 million light-years away in the constellation Eridanus.

This stunning Hubble image encompasses NGC 1309's bluish stars, dark brown gas clouds and pearly white centre, as well as hundreds of distant background galaxies. Nearly every smudge, streak and blob of light in this image is an individual galaxy. The only exception to the extragalactic ensemble is a star, which can be identified near the top of the frame by its diffraction spikes. It is positively neighborly, just a few thousand light-years away in the Milky Way galaxy.

Hubble has turned its attention toward NGC 1309 several times; previous Hubble images of this galaxy were released in 2006 and 2014. Much of NGC 1309's scientific interest derives from two supernovae, SN 2002fk in 2002 and SN 2012Z in 2012. SN 2002fk was a perfect example of a Type Ia supernova, which happens when the core of a dead star (a white dwarf) explodes.

SN 2012Z, on the other hand, was a bit of a renegade. It was classified as a Type Iax supernova: while its spectrum resembled that of a Type Ia supernova, the explosion wasn't as bright as expected. Hubble observations showed that in this case, the supernova did not destroy the white dwarf completely, leaving behind a 'zombie star' that shone even brighter than it did before the explosion. Hubble observations of NGC 1309 taken across several years also made this the first time the white dwarf progenitor of a supernova has been identified in images taken before the explosion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Researchers discover key social factors that triple long COVID risk","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250803233104.htm","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 11:34:51 GMT","

Mass General Brigham investigators led a nationwide study that found that financial hardship, food insecurity, lack of healthcare access, and other social risk factors are linked to higher risks of long COVID.

Long COVID includes a wide range of symptoms that present or persist three or more months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although in recent years researchers have gained greater insight into the prevalence, symptoms and effects of long COVID through the longitudinal Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, social risk factors for developing long COVID remain incompletely understood. In a new analysis of the RECOVER-Adult cohort, Mass General Brigham researchers found a two- to three-times higher risk of long COVID in those with social risk factors, including financial hardship, food insecurity, experiences of medical discrimination, and skipped medical care due to cost. Findings are published in Annals of Internal Medicine.

""During the pandemic, we saw the overwhelming role that social risk factors played in determining who was infected with COVID-19 and what the severity and mortality from disease was,"" said lead author Candace Feldman, MD, MPH, ScD, of the Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation and Immunity at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. ""We wanted to understand whether those risk factors also play a significant role in the longer-term, chronic symptoms that can affect people months and even years after SARS-CoV-2 infection.""

In this study, the researchers analyzed 3,700 participants from the RECOVER-Adult cohort, who had a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Omicron variant outbreak, completed a baseline survey about social and economic factors at the time of infection, and completed a six-month follow-up survey assessing long COVID symptoms. The RECOVER-Adult participants were from 33 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, and joined the study between October 2021 and November 2023.

In the baseline survey, the researchers assessed four major individual-level social risk factors: economic instability, education and language access barriers, health care access and quality challenges, and lack of social and community support using a series of questions and previously validated surveys. They also used ZIP code data to study area-level measures of risk, like household crowding.

After adjusting for variables including hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection (as a marker of disease severity), vaccination history, pregnancy status, age, sex, race and ethnicity, the researchers found significant associations between nearly all the individual-level social risk factors studied and increased risk of developing long COVID. Furthermore, a greater number of social risk factors conferred a higher risk of long COVID. Living in areas with more household crowding was also associated with a greater risk of long COVID.

There was a significantly higher burden of social risk factors among racially or ethnically minoritized groups. However, the researchers found that social risk factors appeared to affect white, Black and Hispanic people's risks of long COVID similarly.

Going forward, RECOVER Initiative researchers hope to determine whether these findings extend to children with long COVID and whether certain long COVID symptoms may be linked to specific social risk factors. They also hope to study symptoms of COVID-19 lasting a year or longer to better understand how social factors might contribute to these symptoms' persistence.

""While rates of COVID-19 have decreased, long COVID is a chronic disease that many people still suffer from,"" said senior author Elizabeth Karlson, MD, MS, of the Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation and Immunity at BWH. ""As with other chronic diseases, many different parts of people's social environment influence long COVID risk. Future interventions must address these factors to effectively reduce adverse outcomes among people with high burden of social risk factors.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Radar that could find life on Europa just nailed its first big test","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250803233103.htm","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 12:42:21 GMT","

NASA's largest interplanetary probe tested its radar during a Mars flyby. The results include a detailed image and bode well for the mission at Jupiter's moon Europa.

As it soared past Mars in March, NASA's Europa Clipper conducted a critical radar test that had been impossible to accomplish on Earth. Now that mission scientists have studied the full stream of data, they can declare success: The radar performed just as expected, bouncing and receiving signals off the region around Mars' equator without a hitch.

Called REASON (Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface), the radar instrument will ""see"" into Europa's icy shell, which may have pockets of water inside. The radar may even be able to detect the ocean beneath the shell of Jupiter's fourth-largest moon.

""We got everything out of the flyby that we dreamed,"" said Don Blankenship, principal investigator of the radar instrument, of the University of Texas at Austin. ""The goal was to determine the radar's readiness for the Europa mission, and it worked. Every part of the instrument proved itself to do exactly what we intended.""

The radar will help scientists understand how the ice may capture materials from the ocean and transfer them to the surface of the moon. Above ground, the instrument will help to study elements of Europa's topography, such as ridges, so scientists can examine how they relate to features that REASON images beneath the surface.

Limits of Earth

Europa Clipper has an unusual radar setup for an interplanetary spacecraft: REASON uses two pairs of slender antennas that jut out from the solar arrays, spanning a distance of about 58 feet (17.6 meters). Those arrays themselves are huge -- from tip to tip, the size of a basketball court -- so they can catch as much light as possible at Europa, which gets about 1/25th the sunlight as Earth.

The instrument team conducted all the testing that was possible prior to the spacecraft's launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Oct. 14, 2024. During development, engineers at the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California even took the work outdoors, using open-air towers on a plateau above JPL to stretch out and test engineering models of the instrument's spindly high-frequency and more compact very-high-frequency antennas.

But once the actual flight hardware was built, it needed to be kept sterile and could be tested only in an enclosed area. Engineers used the giant High Bay 1 clean room at JPL, where the spacecraft was assembled, to test the instrument piece by piece. To test the ""echo,"" or the bounceback of REASON's signals, however, they'd have needed a chamber about 250 feet (76 meters) long -- nearly three-quarters the length of a football field.

Enter Mars

The mission's primary goal in flying by Mars on March 1, less than five months after launch, was to use the planet's gravitational pull to reshape the spacecraft's trajectory. But it also presented opportunities to calibrate the spacecraft's infrared camera and perform a dry run of the radar instrument over terrain NASA scientists have been studying for decades.

As Europa Clipper zipped by the volcanic plains of the Red Planet -- starting at 3,100 miles (5,000 kilometers) down to 550 miles (884 kilometers) above the surface -- REASON sent and received radio waves for about 40 minutes. In comparison, at Europa the instrument will operate as close as 16 miles (25 kilometers) from the moon's surface.

All told, engineers were able to collect 60 gigabytes of rich data from the instrument. Almost immediately, they could tell REASON was working well. The flight team scheduled the full dataset to download, starting in mid-May. Scientists relished the opportunity over the next couple of months to examine the information in detail and compare notes.

""The engineers were excited that their test worked so perfectly,"" said JPL's Trina Ray, Europa Clipper deputy science manager. ""All of us who had worked so hard to make this test happen -- and the scientists seeing the data for the first time -- were ecstatic, saying, 'Oh, look at this! Oh, look at that!' Now, the science team is getting a head start on learning how to process the data and understand the instrument's behavior compared to models. They are exercising those muscles just like they will out at Europa.""

Europa Clipper's total journey to reach the icy moon will be about 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers) and includes one more gravity assist -- using Earth -- in 2026. The spacecraft is currently about 280 million miles (450 million kilometers) from Earth.

More About Europa Clipper

Europa Clipper's three main science objectives are to determine the thickness of the moon's icy shell and its interactions with the ocean below, to investigate its composition, and to characterize its geology. The mission's detailed exploration of Europa will help scientists better understand the astrobiological potential for habitable worlds beyond our planet.

Managed by Caltech in Pasadena, California, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California leads the development of the Europa Clipper mission in partnership with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. APL designed the main spacecraft body in collaboration with JPL and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The Planetary Missions Program Office at NASA Marshall executes program management of the Europa Clipper mission. NASA's Launch Services Program, based at NASA Kennedy, managed the launch service for the Europa Clipper spacecraft. The REASON radar investigation is led by the University of Texas at Austin.

Ultraprocessed food (UPF) consumption is associated with noncommunicable disease risk, yet no trial has assessed its health impact within the context of national dietary guidelines. In a 2 × 2 crossover randomized controlled feeding trial, 55 adults in England (body mass index ≥25 to <40 kg m−2, habitual UPF intake ≥50% kcal day−1) were provided with two 8-week ad libitum diets following the UK Eatwell Guide: (1) minimally processed food (MPF) and (2) UPF, in a random order. Twenty-eight people were randomized to MPF then UPF, and 27 to UPF then MPF; 50 participants comprised the intention-to-treat sample. The primary outcome was the within-participant difference in percent weight change (%WC) between diets, from baseline to week 8. Participants were blinded to the primary outcome. MPF (%WC, −2.06 (95% confidence interval (CI), −2.99, −1.13) and UPF (%WC, −1.05 (95% CI, −1.98, −0.13)) resulted in weight loss, with significantly greater %WC on MPF (Δ%WC, −1.01 (95% CI, −1.87, −0.14), P = 0.024; Cohen's d, −0.48 (95% CI, −0.91, −0.06)). Mild gastrointestinal adverse events were common on both diets. Findings indicate greater weight loss on MPF than UPF diets and needing dietary guidance on food processing in addition to existing recommendations. Clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT05627570.

Three billion people worldwide live with overweight or obesity1, driving increased risks of noncommunicable disease and early death2. A proposed cause has been from recent major changes in the food environment3. In particular, the increased accessibility and consumption of ultraprocessed food (UPF)3,4. Most commonly defined using the Nova classification5, UPF are industrial formulations combining extracts of original foods with additives and industrial ingredients5. Examples include breakfast cereals, sweets, and mass-produced bread5. Over 50% of UK energy intake is reported to come from UPF6, with similarly high intakes in the USA and Europe7. Higher UPF intakes are associated with increased risks of obesity8, cardiometabolic disease, and all-cause mortality9,10. As a result, countries including Brazil11 and organizations including the World Health Organization12 recommend reducing UPF intake in their dietary guidance. In the UK, where nearly two-thirds of adults live with overweight or obesity13, calls have been made for policy action on reducing UPF, yet this is still debated14.

The Eatwell Guide (EWG) provides the UK public with guidance on a healthy diet15,16, following recommendations by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN). The EWG focuses on macronutrients (for example, fat, protein, carbohydrate) and food groups (for example, fruits and vegetables, dairy, starchy food), but not UPF16. Currently fewer than 0.1% of UK adults follow EWG recommendations, and nearly 70% follow less than half of the recommendations17. SACN recently reported that there was insufficient evidence to include UPF within dietary guidelines18, with the 2025 US Dietary Guidelines for Americans Committee (DGAC) reaching similar conclusions19.

Both SACN and the US DGAC19 recommended that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed due to the lack of high-quality interventional evidence18. SACN particularly recommended trials comparing UPF with minimally processed food (MPF) in the context of existing UK dietary recommendations18. Current evidence suggests that the associations between UPF and adverse health outcomes are not explained by macronutrient or food group guidance within dietary recommendations10. To date, two RCTs demonstrate unfavorable weight changes on UPF compared with MPF diets matched for presented energy and nutrients20,21, but no RCTs have assessed the health impact of food processing in the context of dietary guidance.

Therefore, ‘Ultra processed versus minimally processed diets following UK dietary guidance on health outcomes' (UPDATE)—a single-center, community-based, 2 × 2 crossover RCT—aimed to compare the health effects between 8-week MPF and UPF diets following EWG recommendations (Fig. 1a)22. The primary objective was to compare percentage weight change (%WC) between diets. Secondary objectives were to compare changes in anthropometrics, body composition, cardiometabolic and appetite-related outcomes between diets.

Between April 2023 and May 2024, 135 adults underwent screening, of whom 55 (40.1%) were eligible and allocated randomly to either MPF then UPF (n = 28), or UPF then MPF (n = 27) diets. The first and last participants were enrolled on 3 April 2023 and 7 May 2024, respectively. Figure 1b presents participant flow. Six participants withdrew during the first-period MPF diet (sequence MPF/UPF), two during washout (sequence MPF/UPF) and four during the second-period MPF diet (sequence UPF/MPF). In total, 50 participants provided primary outcome data for at least one diet (intention-to-treat (ITT)) and 43 provided primary outcome data for both diets without withdrawal (per protocol (PP)). Baseline characteristics are given in Table 1. Mean age was 43.2 years (s.e., 1.5), 36 (65.5%) were of white ethnicity, 50 (90.9%) were female and nine (16.4%) were nightshift workers. Mean weight was 89.4 kg (s.e., 1.7), and body mass index (BMI) 32.7 kg m−2 (s.e., 0.5). Mean habitual UPF intake was 67.4% kcal day−1 (s.e., 1.1), with mean macronutrient and food group intakes not adherent to EWG recommendations, except red meat intake. Baseline characteristics for ITT and PP samples are in Supplementary Tables 1–3.

Sociodemographic, clinical and dietary and baseline characteristics were similar between dropouts (N = 12) and nondropouts (N = 43) (Supplementary Table 4).

In the ITT analysis, %WC at 8 weeks was significantly lower on both diets (MPF, −2.06% ((95% confidence interval (CI), −2.99, −1.13); UPF, −1.05% (95% CI, −1.98, −0.13)) (Fig. 2). Within-participant differences in %WC were significantly greater on the MPF versus UPF diet (Δ%WC, −1.01% (s.e., 0.43; 95% CI, −1.87, −0.14; P = 0.024). Unadjusted changes are in Supplementary Table 5.

Results by randomization arm are in Supplementary Table 6. A significant diet order effect was detected (Pinteraction < 0.05; Extended Data Fig. 1). A larger Δ%WC was observed when analyzing the first-period diet of each arm only (Δ%WC, −1.86% (s.e., 0.72); P = 0.012).

Secondary ITT outcomes are in Table 2, with unadjusted changes and changes by randomization arm in Supplementary Tables 5 and 6, respectively.

Weight and BMI were significantly lower at 8 weeks from baseline on both diets. Waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio did not differ significantly. Reductions in weight (−0.96 kg (s.e., 0.40); P = 0.019) and BMI (−0.34 kg m−2 (s.e., 0.14); P = 0.021) were significantly greater on the MPF versus UPF diet, with no significant differences in waist circumference.

Fat mass, body fat percentage, visceral fat rating and total body water mass were significantly lower at 8 weeks from baseline on the MPF but not UPF diet. Muscle mass, bone mass, fat-free mass and total body water percentage did not significantly differ at 8 weeks from baseline on either diet. Reductions in fat mass (−0.98 kg (s.e., 0.32); P = 0.004), body fat percentage (−0.76% (s.e., 0.28); P = 0.010), visceral fat rating (−0.41 (s.e., 0.15); P = 0.008) and total body water mass (−0.51 kg (s.e., 0.15); P = 0.002) were significantly greater on the MPF compared with UPF diet. Other body composition outcomes did not differ significantly between diets.

Systolic blood pressure (BP) (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly lower at 8 weeks compared with baseline on the MPF but not UPF diet, whereas heart rate (HR) was significantly lower on the UPF but not MPF diet. Changes in BP and HR did not differ significantly between diets.

Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and non-HDL-C were significantly lower at 8 weeks compared with baseline on both diets. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and triglycerides were significantly lower at 8 weeks compared with baseline on the MPF diet only, whereas fasting glucose and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were significantly lower at 8 weeks compared with baseline on the UPF diet only. Bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, albumin, total-cholesterol-to-HDL ratio and C-reactive protein (CRP) did not differ significantly at 8 weeks compared with baseline on either diet. Changes in triglycerides were significantly lower on the MPF than UPF diet (−0.25 mmol l−1 (s.e., 0.08); P = 0.004), whereas changes in LDL-C were significantly lower on the UPF than MPF diet (0.25 mmol l−1 (s.e., 0.10); P = 0.016). Changes in other biomarkers did not differ significantly.

The Power of Food Scale (PFS) (food present, tasted and total score) and Control of Eating Questionnaire (CoEQ) craving for sweet, savory and difficulty to resist craved nominated food were significantly lower at 8 weeks from baseline on the MPF but not UPF diet. CoEQ craving control was significantly higher at 8 weeks on both diets. PFS food available and CoEQ positive mood at 8 weeks did not differ significantly from baseline on either diet. Improvements in CoEQ craving for savory (−10.46 (s.e., 4.12); P = 0.015), difficulty to resist craved nominated food (−13.77 (s.e., 6.35); P = 0.037) and craving control (11.68 (s.e., 4.74); P = 0.019) were significantly greater on the MPF than UPF diet. Other changes in CoEQ and PFS did not differ significantly between diets.

Fasted and fed visual analog scales (VAS) did not significantly differ at 8 weeks from baseline on either diet, and changes were not significantly different between diets (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). Trends were observed for lower postprandial hunger, capacity to eat, pleasure to eat and feelings of fullness on the MPF versus UPF diet (Fig. 3).

Estimated marginal means and s.e. computed from mixed-effects models adjusted for randomization arm and nightshift status, with an interaction term for diet and randomization arm, interaction term for diet and time at visit (0, 15, 30 min) and a random effect for participant; ITT N = 50. Minute 0, fasted; minutes 15 and 30, fed.

Self-reported diet intake data from the MPF and UPF diets are in Supplementary Tables 9–13. In the ITT sample, energy intake was −503.7 kcal day−1 (s.e., 130.2; P < 0.001) and −289.6 kcal day−1 (s.e., 102.8; P = 0.007) lower during the MPF and UPF diet compared with baseline, respectively. Self-reported energy intake was significantly lower (−327.3 kcal day−1 (s.e., 110.2; P = 0.005) on the MPF versus UPF diet.

In the ITT sample (N = 50), 32 and 35 participants provided completed food diaries for MPF and UPF diets, respectively. MPF adherence was 84.5% and UPF adherence was 91.2%. Adherence was higher in the first periods (MPF first, 91.8%; second, 78.5%; UPF first, 93.3%, second, 87.4%).

Diet ratings are listed in Supplementary Tables 14 and 15 (by randomization arm). There were no significant differences in ratings of the diets overall, meals and snacks overall, textures, portion sizes, hunger levels, contentment and sustainability. Flavors and tastes (−1.08 (95% CI, −1.99, −0.16); P = 0.022) and delivery and preparation (−1.60 (95% CI, −2.78, −0.42); P = 0.009) were rated significantly lower on the MPF versus UPF diet.

There were no significant differences in the change in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) performed from baseline to week 8 between diets (Supplementary Table 16).

Adverse events (AE) are listed in Table 3. AEs were common and mild on both diets, with no related serious AEs (SAEs). Gastrointestinal AEs were most common. AEs did not differ significantly by diet (P = 0.088) or randomization arm (P = 0.390). Notably, greater AEs were reported on the UPF diet for constipation (MPF, 3; UPF, 11), dyspepsia/gastroesophageal reflux (MPF, 29; UPF, 36), fatigue (MPF, 4; UPF, 16), sleep-related AEs (MPF, 1; UPF, 7) and infections (MPF, 9; UPF, 17).

Changes in body composition corresponded to estimated daily energy imbalances of −289.9 kcal day−1 (95% CI, −423.7, −156.1) and −119.5 kcal day−1 (95% CI, −251.7, 12.7) on MPF and UPF diets, respectively, which was significantly lower on the MPF diet (−170.4 kcal day−1 (s.e., 57.9); P = 0.005). Maintaining the 8-week weight loss trajectories over 1 year would be estimated to result in ~9% and ~13% weight loss on the MPF diet, and ~5% and ~4% weight loss on the UPF diet, for female and male participants, respectively. Habitual UPF intake and initial weight were not significantly associated with %WC on either diet. Habitual energy intake was inversely associated with %WC on the MPF (P = 0.033) but not UPF diet (P = 0.090).

Changes in waist-to-height ratio at 8 weeks from baseline did not differ significantly between diets (Supplementary Table 17).

In prespecified sensitivity analyses, results were consistent at 4 weeks (Supplementary Table 18), in repeated-measures analyses (Supplementary Table 19), in PP analyses (Supplementary Tables 8 and 20–22) and in sensitivity analyses using inverse probability weighting and multiple imputation (Supplementary Table 23). In post hoc sensitivity analyses, results were consistent when analyzing primary outcome data only where participants provided diet adherence data (Supplementary Table 23), and when using first-period diet data only, except that BP changes were significantly lower on the MPF versus UPF diet, and fasting glucose change was no longer significantly different between diets (Supplementary Tables 6 and 8).

In this study, both MPF and UPF diets following national healthy dietary guidance resulted in percentage weight loss after 8 weeks, with significantly greater reductions on the MPF diet. Greater weight, BMI and fat mass loss were also observed on the MPF compared with the UPF diet, as well as greater reductions in triglycerides and cravings. Conversely, LDL-C was lower on the UPF diet. Overall, these results suggest favorable changes in body composition and craving control from adhering to national dietary guidance with a diet of MPF rather than UPF.

These findings build on two metabolic ward RCTs assessing the health impacts of ad libitum UPF and MPF/non-UPF diets matched for presented calories and nutrients, highlighting the importance of UPF in addition to traditional dietary guidance. Hall et al. observed weight loss on a 2-week MPF diet (−0.9 kg) and weight gain on a 2-week UPF diet (0.9 kg)20, whereas Hamano et al. reported weight gain on both 7-day non-UPF and UPF diets, but with significantly greater weight gain (1.1 kg (95% CI, 0.2, 2.0)) on the UPF diet21. In contrast with our hypothesis given the body of observational evidence linking UPF with weight gain8, the UPF diet following UK dietary guidance resulted in weight loss. However, weight loss on the MPF diet was significantly greater than on the UPF diet. Our study therefore confirms and builds upon previous findings, showing significant differences in weight change between matched UPF and MPF/non-UPF diets20,21, within the context of existing healthy dietary guidance.

Previous trials further considered changes in body composition. Hall et al. found that fat mass increased on the UPF diet, but decreased on the MPF diet, differing significantly between diets20. Similar findings were reported in Hamano et al.21, with additional findings of no liver fat changes. Regarding fat-free mass, Hall et al. observed trends for an increase on the UPF diet and decrease on the MPF diet, which again showed differences20, whereas Hamano et al. saw no significant differences between diets21. Our study builds upon these findings by considering body composition changes from UPF and MPF diets in the context of dietary guidance. We observed that the greater weight loss on the MPF diet was through greater reductions in fat mass and total body water mass, with no significant differences in fat-free mass change between diets. Despite the UPF diet leading to weight loss, there were no significant reductions in adiposity (fat mass, body fat percentage or visceral fat rating), with the greater fat mass reductions on the MPF diet being key in addressing obesity-related poor cardiometabolic health23. However, no significant differences were observed for waist circumference change between diets.

Clinically significant weight loss is related directly to favorable changes in cardiometabolic risk factors, including BP, blood glucose, HbA1c and lipids24. However, the greater weight and fat mass reductions on the MPF compared with the UPF diet did not translate into significant improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors over the UPF diet, except triglycerides. Indeed, the UPF diet led to reductions in several cardiometabolic risk factors including HR, fasting glucose, cholesterol and LDL-C. Whereas only the MPF diet resulted in significant BP reduction, this did not differ significantly from the UPF diet. Similarly, limited differences in biomarkers were observed previously. Hall et al. reported lower HDL-C on the MPF versus UPF diet, but no significant differences in triglycerides, high-sensitivity CRP, HbA1c, glucose or LDL-C between diets20. Hamano et al. reported significantly greater reductions in total cholesterol and HDL-C on the non-UPF versus UPF diet, and significantly greater increases in liver function markers on the UPF versus non-UPF diet, but no differences in other markers. For our trial and the two previous trials, longer durations may be required for sufficient weight loss differences to occur between diets for clinically significant differences in cardiometabolic risk factors to emerge.

Several mechanisms are proposed for the contrasting weight changes between UPF and MPF diets, including nutrient composition, texture, energy density and eating rate8. In contrast to the two previous trials20,21 and to typical nutrient-poor UPF diets25, the UPF diet in this study followed national healthy dietary guidance. This included nutritionally improved, reformulated UPF such as breakfast cereals, ready meals and plant-based alternatives. These typically have nutrition or health claims and green and amber front-of-package label traffic lights (which guide consumer choice at point-of-purchase, with red traffic lights for products high in fat, saturated fat, sugar and/or salt)25. Such foods are nutritionally comparable to MPF in the UK25 and recommended in current UK dietary guidelines16. Thus, the presented UPF diet contained recommended intakes of nutrients, fiber and fruit and vegetables16. Participants' habitual diets were typically misaligned with EWG recommendations and were above average for UPF consumption in the UK6. Therefore, the improvement in diet quality towards EWG recommendations on the provided UPF diet without necessarily increasing UPF intake from participants' habitual diets likely explained the neutral or favorable changes and the absence of detrimental changes on the UPF diet. However, despite this, the UPF diet did not result in the same extent of weight loss as the MPF diet, nor did it result in significant fat loss. Reported energy intakes were in line with the primary outcome findings, with a deficit on both diets, but to a greater extent on the MPF diet. Removing UPF provided additional benefit beyond existing dietary recommendations, suggesting other potential mechanisms of UPF besides nutritional quality.

One potential mechanism is energy density. The UPF diet in this trial was more energy dense than the MPF diet. This is representative of nutritionally improved ‘healthy' UPF in the UK, which have a higher energy density than comparable ‘healthy' MPF25. In previous RCTs, nonbeverage energy density of the UPF diet was also higher, with a faster eating rate (both energy and weight)20 and fewer chews per bite on the UPF diet21, which can promote greater energy intake26. Hyperpalatability and taste may also promote increased UPF consumption27. Both previous trials reported similar appetite ratings between diets20. Similarly, we found comparable ratings between diets. However, flavor and taste ratings were significantly lower on the MPF diet. This may have impacted on eating behavior and led to lower consumption on the MPF diet or greater consumption on the UPF diet, as evidenced with withdrawals on the MPF diet but no withdrawals on the UPF diet. There were also improvements in craving control on the MPF versus UPF diet despite greater weight loss, as well as significant reductions in hedonic appetite on the MPF but not UPF diet, although differences were not significant. There were also trends favoring improved subjective appetite in the immediate postprandial state on the MPF diet. Combined, these findings may promote appropriate meal termination on the MPF versus UPF diet, reflected in the greater weight loss, and further supporting long-term weight loss maintenance28. Marketing and advertising heavily influence eating behavior29, particularly UPF30. Previous trials were conducted in metabolic wards, providing UPF without packaging. In this study, UPF were delivered in their branded packaging as experienced in the real world. Although no products on the UPF diet included ‘reduced calorie' labeling, many carried nutrition or health claims. This may have influenced eating behavior and perceptions of appropriate portion sizing31, eating the suggested UPF portion sizes compared with eating ad libitum on the MPF diet.

Although no significant differences in AEs were observed between diets, a higher incidence of fatigue and common gastrointestinal issues including constipation and dyspepsia/reflux were observed on the UPF diet. Growing evidence links UPF intake with gastrointestinal pathology, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer and disorders of gut–brain interaction32. This study provides preliminary experimental insights into potential gut disruption from UPF that requires further investigation.

An order effect was observed, with less weight loss on the second-period diets across both randomization arms. Hall et al. observed no significant order effects between diets on energy intake, bodyweight or body composition, despite no washout period33. Adherence was likely a factor explaining the lower %WC during second-period diets here, with a notable drop in adherence on the second-period MPF diet and, to a lesser extent, the second-period UPF diet. Furthermore, simultaneously and instantaneously switching onto a healthy diet devoid of ultraprocessing may have had an additive effect on %WC compared with a more modest effect from switching onto a healthy diet that remained high in UPF. The subsequent transition onto the healthy diet devoid of ultraprocessing may have had attenuated effects on %WC. Results were consistent when analyzing data from the first-period diets only, with significant differences of 1.86% in %WC between diets.

These findings highlight the benefit of following UK dietary recommendations. Maintaining the 8-week weight loss trajectories over 1 year may result in an estimated 9–13% and 4–5% weight loss on MPF and UPF diets, respectively34. However, this trial also demonstrates the differential impact of UPF and MPF on weight and body composition while following national dietary guidance, and the obesity-related health implications of the foods constituting most of the energy intake in the UK population6.

These findings on the relative importance of food processing should complement and expand, not displace, current understanding of diet-related health. A House of Lords committee report highlighted the need for a healthier UK food environment35. The wider food system is key in driving diet-related poor health and obesity by enabling ready availability to cheap, unhealthy food36. Little success13 has been achieved in addressing obesity since 1992, despite 14 government obesity strategies in England37. Many obesity policies focus on person-level actions, rather than system-level changes. The concept of Nova and ultraprocessing shifts the focus onto the environmental drivers of obesity and the influence of transnational food companies in shaping unhealthy food environments36,38. Reductionist approaches focusing solely on nutrient reformulation or individual-level action insufficiently address environmental factors. Stakeholders across disciplines and organizations must align and focus on wider actions to improve the food environment (for example, taxes and subsidies), to enable affordable, available and desirable healthy diets for all8,36.

Strengths of UPDATE include the 8-week duration of each intervention. Diets were matched for UK national dietary guidance, ensuring results are directly relevant for UK public health food policy. Given the similarities between UK and most dietary guidelines worldwide that do not consider UPF, these findings are likely to be relevant to many countries. The crossover design removed between-participant confounding, and the free-living, community-based setting provides real-world evidence directly applicable to the public. Participants were blind to the primary outcome and not told to change their weight or dietary intake. Providing all food and drink ready prepared without cost to participants' homes helped maximize adherence, ensure internal validity and minimize dropout39,40. UPF was sourced from leading UK supermarkets and were not culinary preparations, providing a diet representative of UPF available in the UK. Participants' habitual dietary intakes were broadly similar to UK averages41, aiding generalizability to the UK population. The trial was funded by a medical charity and nongovernmental organization, without industry or commercial influence.

Limitations include that a potential carryover effect cannot be ruled out. However, the washout period helped minimize this. People with dietary restrictions (for example, vegan, halal, kosher) were excluded due to financial and logistical constraints, limiting generalizability. However, participants with minor dietary restrictions/intolerances were eligible if such foods were not on menus. The results also may not generalize to people with low UPF intake, and do not imply that switching from a low- to high-UPF diet following dietary guidance carries neutral or favorable effects. The lack of inpatient settings limits monitoring of adherence. Not all participants returned their food diaries to monitor adherence. However, reported adherence was high, with previous studies indicating high adherence when all food is provided and delivered to participants' homes39. Moreover, results were unchanged when considering only the sample returning food diaries. It was not possible to directly assess energy balance measures such as energy intake or mechanisms such as eating rate due to the free-living design. To minimize participant burden, nutrient biomarkers and stable isotope analyses were not used for diet assessment; however, there are currently no validated biomarkers of UPF intake. Detailed body composition analyses such as dual X-ray absorptiometry were also not conducted. Finally, there was no processed food diet, though the smaller number and range of processed foods limits the ability to create a healthy, balanced processed food diet25.

In conclusion, ad libitum 8-week MPF and UPF diets meeting UK dietary guidance resulted in weight loss, but with significantly greater reductions in weight on the MPF than on the UPF diet. These findings highlight the importance of food processing in public health policy and dietary guidance in addition to existing recommendations.

The trial protocol has been published previously22. Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines42 were used to design the protocol, and reporting was according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)43.

Fifty-five adults were recruited from South East England and London. Written informed consent was obtained before any screening or research-associated measurement. The last participant last visit was 13 October 2024.

Inclusion criteria included any staff at University College London Hospital (UCLH), age ≥18 years, BMI between ≥25 kg m−2 and <40 kg m−2 (living with overweight or obesity), ≥50% kcal day−1 of habitual dietary intake consisting of UPF, weight stable (≤5% variation in weight in the last 3 months), medically safe to participate in a dietary intervention, able to read and write in English, willing and able to give written informed consent, able to comply with the study protocol and attend relevant inperson and online sessions and use of contraception until the end of the intervention period where necessary. Exclusion criteria included contraindication for a dietary intervention, participation in another clinical intervention trial, BMI > 40 kg m−2 or basal metabolic rate ≥2,300 kcal day−1 (to ensure intervention diets are at least 300 kcal day−1 greater than maintenance energy needs, based on excess energy intakes reported in ref. 20), diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or use of insulin, eating disorder, celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease, any dietary restrictions (for example, vegan, vegetarian, Halal or kosher requirements, diagnosed food allergy or other allergy) that limit the ability to adhere to the dietary intervention, recent commencement of medications that cause weight gain or weight loss, a history of drug or alcohol abuse, pregnancy, breast-feeding or intention to become pregnant and any other factor making the participant unsuitable in the view of investigator.

On 16 June 2023, the UPF intake inclusion criterion was lowered from ≥60% to ≥50% to better reflect average UPF intake of prospective participants in South East England and London6. Participants were also asked to provide ratings of both diets after completion of the RCT (detailed below).

Participants were block randomized by the research team using Sealed Envelope (https://www.sealedenvelope.com) to either (1) the MPF diet then UPF diet (n = 28), or (2) the UPF diet then MPF diet (n = 27). Sealed Envelope generated the random allocation sequence. Randomization was stratified by nightshift status, sex and ethnicity. Researchers were not blind to assignment and enrolled participants. An independent statistician verified the primary outcome analysis while remaining blind to allocation assignment. Participants were not informed of the processing groups of the diets. All participant communications omitted the terms MPF or UPF, with diets being referred to as Diet A or Diet B.

Participants were provided with an 8-week MPF diet and an 8-week UPF diet, both following EWG recommendations, in a random order, with a 4-week washout period. Participants were given all meals, snacks and drinks for both diets, which were delivered to participants' homes twice per week. The Nova classification was used to classify food and drink into UPF and MPF5. The research team agreed on UPF items based on identifying ingredients of industrial use in product ingredient lists explicitly defining a product as UPF in published definitions (for example, cosmetic additives)5. Meals and snacks on the MPF diet were culinary preparations of individual ingredients (for example, raw meat, vegetables, oats, butter) ensuring correct Nova classification and no ambiguous decision on mixed dishes/shop-bought items.

Diets were matched for, and followed, government recommended nutrient intakes in the EWG15,16, which focuses on specific macronutrients and food types. Guidance includes choosing foods lower in saturated fat, added sugar and salt, consuming five daily portions of fruit and vegetables, basing meals on starchy carbohydrates and eating a variety of foods in the right proportions16 (Supplementary Table 24). To ensure ad libitum energy intake, diets were scaled up to approximately 4,000 kcal day−1. Menus were designed to be representative of UK diets by identifying the most commonly consumed food groups from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey41. Practical and logistical aspects including price, best-before dates, storage and preparation requirements, and accessibility were factored into the design44. Meals and snacks were matched across diets where possible, with a 7-day rotating menu to prevent participant boredom and sensory-specific satiety45. A patient and public involvement focus group provided feedback on the menu before the study. Menu guides were provided with instructions and pictures to prepare each meal. Supplementary Tables 24–26 report the average nutrient compositions of the provided diets, the menus and the images of meals and snacks on the menus, respectively.

As in previous ad libitum feeding trials investigating weight change46, participants were asked to consume as much or as little of the provided diets as desired. Participants were told to consume only the food and drink provided and to not consume any other food or drink, except water, during each 8-week diet. Tea and coffee were provided. Minor modifications to the intervention that did not alter the overall design were acceptable for enabling adherence (for example participants were allowed to add additional herbs and spices to meals but were not allowed to use any calorie- or salt-containing condiments). Alcohol was allowed but not provided. Participants were told to keep alcohol consumption within government guidelines (≤14 weekly units)47. Participants were educated on the EWG, but no further lifestyle guidance was provided (that is, no advice on physical activity, smoking or sleep). Participants were supported during each diet through weekly calls with the research team to discuss any issues and to promote adherence. Participants returned to their habitual diet during the 4-week washout period to minimize carryover effects. No food was provided during the 2-week baseline periods.

Figure 1a outlines the study design and measurement timepoints. Age, sex, ethnicity, occupation, nightshift work pattern, educational level, marital status, medical history, medication intake, alcohol consumption, smoking habits and family history of obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes were self-reported at screening.

The baseline period lasted 2 weeks to allow time to collect all data to check eligibility, including regarding habitual UPF intake with two additional nonconsecutive recalls after screening, followed by randomization and booking in the baseline visit, and then sufficient notice and time to set participants up with their first food delivery. For consistency, a 2-week assessment window was used for the baseline visit of the second diet.

Weight was measured using an electronic scale to the nearest 0.1 kg (Tanita DC-430MAS; Tanita). Body composition, including fat mass, body fat percentage, visceral fat rating, fat-free mass, muscle mass, bone mass, total body water mass and total body water percentage were assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) (Tanita) at each visit. BIA at baseline and week 8 was conducted following an overnight fast with no alcohol intake or strenuous activity in the preceding 24 h. Assessments at week 4 were not fasted. Participants were provided with standardized wording in the week before their baseline and week 8 visits to maintain a consistent hydration status: “Please make sure that for the visit, you eat your usual diet for the 24 h before the visit day and to avoid alcohol and strenuous exercise. Please fast from 20:00 pm on the night before the study visit, and drink only water. Please do try to drink some water before the visit as this helps with the cannulation.ˮ Upon arrival, participants were asked to confirm that they had fasted and given the opportunity to drink water to thirst before measurements to ensure consistency. Basal metabolic rate was estimated by the Tanita BIA scanner based on fat-free mass and participant age. Height was assessed using a stadiometer to the nearest 0.5 cm. Waist circumference was measured in centimeters using an inelastic tape measure at the iliac crest48. BMI was derived from weight and height (in kg m−2), and waist-to-height ratio from WC and height. Estimated daily energy imbalance was assessed using the energy densities of fat mass and fat-free mass of ~9,300 kcal kg−1 and 1,100 kcal kg−1, respectively49. The mean daily energy imbalance (kcal day−1) for each participant for each diet was calculated as (9,300 × change in fat mass (kg) from baseline to week 8 + 1,100 × change in fat-free mass (kg) from baseline to week 8)/exact number of days from the start of the diet to the week 8 BIA assessment date. BP was recorded in triplicate, seated, alongside HR with an automated sphygmomanometer and oximeter. BP was recorded as the average of the second and third recordings. Venous blood samples were collected after an overnight fast and included glucose, HbA1c, liver function tests (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase and albumin), lipids (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, total-cholesterol-to-HDL ratio, non-HDL-C and triglycerides) and CRP.

CoEQ is a 21-item validated measure of the severity and type of food cravings that a person experiences, as well as of their inhibitory control of eating and subjective sensation of appetite and mood50. The CoEQ contains four domains: overall craving control, craving for sweet, craving for savory and positive mood and one question on perceived control over resisting a self-nominated craved food. PFS is a 15-item validated measure of hedonic appetite, food reward sensitivity and the psychological impact of living in food-abundant environments51. PFS assesses the appetite for and motivation to consume palatable foods at three levels: food available (but not physically present), food present (but not tasted) and food tasted (but not yet consumed)52. An overall PFS score is then computed from the mean of the three subscores. PFS and CoEQ were collected at baseline and at 4- and 8-week visits.

A 30-min meal test was used to assess acute changes in subjective appetite levels in the fasted and fed state at baseline and at 8 weeks. A five-item subjective appetite VAS was completed following an overnight fast. The questions capture aspects of hunger and the desire to eat: “How hungry do you feel right now?,ˮ “How sick do you feel right now?,ˮ “How much do you think you could eat right now?,ˮ “How full do you feel right now?ˮ and “How pleasant would it be to eat right now?,ˮ on a ten-point 100-mm scale, with words anchored at either end marking the extremes (“Not at allˮ and “Extremelyˮ)53. A liquid meal (187.5 ml Abbott Ensure (450 kcal, 17.5 g fat, 54.0 g carbohydrate, 19.1 g protein) was then consumed, and the subjective appetite VAS assessments were repeated at 15 and 30 min after starting the liquid meal.

Baseline habitual dietary intake was assessed using Intake24 (ref. 54)—a validated, online, self-reported 24-h recall system, based on a multiple-pass recall suitable for the general population (https://intake24.co.uk)55,56. Two nonconsecutive 24-h recalls were completed at screening, baseline and at week 4 and week 8 on each diet. Food diaries were provided to record adherence to the diets and report any foods consumed off diet. Nonadherence was prespecified as consuming more than one meal per week off the provided intervention diet. Participants were encouraged to report any deviations from the provided diets and to be as honest as possible, with no repercussions. All completed and returned food diaries were analyzed. The research team provided several options and opportunities for participants to return food diaries to maximize collection, including drop off at follow-up visits or at the research center at participants' convenience during the trial. For any unreturned food diaries, participants were followed up several times to drop off food diaries at the research center at their convenience, post them at no cost or to email their food diary.

MVPA was measured objectively using wGT3X-BT (ActiGraph)—an accelerometer-based activity monitor providing information on body movement using a motion sensor. The device is a reliable tool and has been used widely in clinical research given its practicality, noninvasiveness, and accuracy in measuring physical activity levels in free-living adults57. Participants were instructed to wear the device on their dominant hip continuously for 7 days, to be removed only for water-based activities. Average daily MVPA is a validated measure obtained from hip-worn accelerometers58. For data to be valid, participants must wear the device for at least 4 days with at least 10 h of daily wear time. Wear time was validated in ActiGraph ActiLife software (v.6.13.6), based on the criteria in ref. 59. Thereafter, the cut points proposed by Freedson et al.58 were applied to each participant's counts per minute data to derive the length of time spent in sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous and very vigorous physical activity to calculate average daily MVPA.

Following completion of the RCT, participants were asked to rate both diets on a scale of 0–10, with 0 indicating a negative, poor or bland experience, or the least intensity of the attribute being evaluated, and 10 indicating a positive, excellent or flavorful experience, or the greatest intensity of the attribute being evaluated. Ratings were of the overall experience, of meals and snacks, of flavors and taste, of textures, of portion sizes, of delivery and required preparation, of hunger level, of happiness/contentment and of diet sustainability. Further details on the ratings are provided in Supplementary Table 27.

AEs were recorded by the clinical research team at baseline, at 4-week and 8-week study visits and from weekly phone calls. The assessment of the relationship of an AE with the intervention was carried out by the clinical research team. AEs were considered related if the causal relationship between the intervention and an AE was at least a reasonable possibility, that is, the relationship could not be ruled out. Reporting of AEs and serious AEs was conducted according to the Sponsor's standard operating procedures, and updates on AEs were reported to the Trial Steering Committee and Trial Management Group. All SAEs were reported to the Sponsor within 24 h of the clinical research team becoming aware. A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee was not set up as no SAEs or notable risks were expected from participation. Incidental findings were reported to participants and their general practitioner as per written informed consent.

The primary outcome was the within-participant difference in %WC between MPF and UPF diets at 8 weeks from baseline. %WC is currently used clinically in weight management clinics and across all NHS weight management programs.

Prespecified secondary outcomes include changes in weight, waist circumference, BMI, body fat percentage, fat mass, fat-free mass, visceral fat rating, muscle mass, bone mass, total body water mass, total body water percentage, HR, SBP, DBP, blood markers (HbA1c, glucose, liver function tests, lipids and CRP), PFS (food available, food present, food tasted and total score), CoEQ (overall craving control, craving for sweet, craving for savory, positive mood, perceived control over resisting a self-nominated craved food), fasted and fed changes in the five-item subjective appetite VAS, dietary intake and average daily MVPA. Secondary outcomes of brain magnetic resonance imaging functional resting-state connectivity, physical function, sleep quality, mental health, quality of life and metabolomics, and results from the follow-up 6-month behavioral support program22 will be reported separately.

Nonprespecified outcomes included AEs, changes in waist-to-height ratio, estimated daily energy imbalance and differences in post hoc ratings of each diet.

The sample size is based on estimated within-participant variation22. The expected weight loss trajectory over 8 weeks was modeled using the National Institutes of Health bodyweight planner34 (https://www.niddk.nih.gov/bwp) and based on data from Hall et al. showing 0.9 kg weight loss following a 2-week MPF diet20, with a s.d. of the mean difference in weight change between MPF and UPF diets of 1.98 kg (mean, 1.85 kg). In total, 44 participants were required to detect a mean difference of 2.7% WC between groups, assuming weight loss on the MPF diet and no WC on the UPF diet, with a s.d. of the mean difference of 5.4% (power, 0.9; alpha, 0.05; two-sided paired t-test, SPSS v.27.0). The final sample size was 55, factoring for a 20% dropout rate.

Normally distributed variables were reported using means and s.e., and non-normally distributed variables reported using medians and interquartile ranges. Categorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages, and analyzed using χ2 tests or Fisher's exact tests where appropriate. Values are presented by randomization group and analyzed as randomized.

The primary outcome analysis was prespecified as an ITT analysis, with all available data being analyzed as randomized. Any participants were included regardless of dropout status if follow-up data on the primary outcome was observed. To use all available data, any participants withdrawing from the trial were included in the ITT analysis if they provided follow-up primary outcome data for at least one of the diet interventions (that is, the minimum data required to contribute to the primary analysis). This includes participants who dropped out after completing the first-period 8-week assessment (use of the first-period data only), or participants who dropped out in the first or second period before the 8-week assessment and agreed to attend 8-week follow-up assessments for measurement of weight (use of the first- and second-period data).

The ITT analysis included participants with baseline and week 8 primary outcome values for at least one diet. The PP analysis included participants with baseline and week 8 values for both diets, and no withdrawal.

Mixed-effects models were used in an ITT analysis to assess the difference in %WC at 8 weeks and secondary outcomes, with a random effect for participants, and adjusting for randomization arm (including interaction with diet) and nightshift status. The primary outcome effect size with 95% CIs was then computed from the mixed-effects model using Cohen's d60.

Initially, an interaction term was included in the primary outcome analysis mixed-effects model between the treatment (UPF or MPF diet) and the randomization arm (MPF/UPF or UPF/MPF) to assess any potential treatment-by-period or carryover effect. This interaction was significant (P < 0.001) and included in the mixed-effects models to account for the diet order/sequence.

The criteria used for selecting potential adjustment covariates for the mixed-effects model were prespecified in the protocol. These were defined as the randomization stratification variables (sex, ethnicity and nightshift status selected a priori based on the literature61,62,63), as well as any baseline participant variables that were not balanced between randomization arms.

Each potential participant baseline adjustment confounder identified from the prespecified criteria was added to the base mixed-effects model (the effect of diet adjusted for randomization arm, with an interaction term for diet and randomization arm and a random effect for participant). The significance of each confounder and the impact on the ITT primary outcome analysis effect estimate was assessed to determine inclusion in the final model (see Supplementary Table 23 for the model adjustment results). In this respect, sex, ethnicity and estimated baseline BMR were each individually not significant predictors of %WC in the mixed-effects model and did not alter the effect estimate of the ITT primary outcome analysis (see Supplementary Table 23 for the model adjustment results). These potential confounders were therefore not included in the final model. In contrast, nightshift status, when added individually, to the based mixed-effects model was a significant predictor of %WC.

Mixed-effects model assumptions including normality of residuals and homoscedasticity were checked visually and verified.

Unadjusted analyses of primary and secondary outcomes at 8 weeks were compared with baseline, and differences in changes from baseline to 8 weeks between diets were assessed using paired t-tests. Analyses were repeated for changes in outcomes at week 4 from baseline between diets, for changes at week 4 and week 8 from baseline between diets using repeated-measures mixed-effects models, for the PP sample, and for results using data from the first period of each randomization arm only. Carryover effects were not assessed as it is not possible to identify a carryover effect or adjust for it in a 2 × 2 crossover design43. No interim analysis was planned or conducted.

The impact of missing data on the primary outcome analysis was assessed using multiple imputation with chained equations under the assumption of data missing at random. Missing data for the primary outcome were first imputed using model variables (diet, randomization arm, nightshift status and available data for %WC), and then imputed using model variables and auxiliary baseline variables (diet, randomization arm, nightshift status, available data for %WC, ethnicity, sex, occupation, education, family history of obesity, baseline estimated BMR, baseline energy intake and baseline weight). The impact of missing data on the primary outcome analysis was also assessed using inverse probability weighting. Propensity scores for receiving the treatment (MPF diet or UPF diet) were first calculated using the randomization stratification variables: sex, ethnicity and nightshift status, and baseline estimated BMR, and then calculated using randomization stratification variables and auxiliary baseline variables (randomization arm, nightshift status, available data for %WC, ethnicity, sex, occupation, education, family history of obesity, baseline estimated BMR, baseline energy intake and baseline weight). Stabilized weights were then used to reweight the remaining sample.

Analyses were conducted in R v.2024.04.1+748. Data were presented in tabular form using Microsoft Excel v.16.91 (24111020), figures were created using Prism 10 v.10.2.3. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. As secondary outcomes in this study are exploratory in nature, significance values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Any apparent significance of these results should be confirmed in future research.

The Yorkshire and The Humber–Sheffield Research Ethics Committee approved the trial on 22 December 2022 (22/YH/0281). The study was registered prospectively on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05627570). All participants provided written informed consent before any screening or research-associated measurement.

NHS staff at UCLH provided input to the trial design following a focus group session. Obesity Empowerment Network UK members with lived experience of obesity also contributed to the study design. One member of the trial steering committee was a lay person. Participants could consent to a lay summary of the trial results.

More than 10 years following the onset of the sea star wasting disease (SSWD) epidemic, affecting over 20 asteroid species from Mexico to Alaska, the causative agent has been elusive. SSWD killed billions of the most susceptible species, sunflower sea stars (Pycnopodia helianthoides), initiating a trophic cascade involving unchecked urchin population growth and the widespread loss of kelp forests. Identifying the causative agent underpins the development of recovery strategies. Here we induced disease and subsequent mortality in exposure experiments using tissue extracts, coelomic fluid and effluent water from wasting sunflower sea stars, with no mortality in controls. Deep sequencing of diseased sea star coelomic fluid samples from experiments and field outbreaks revealed a dominant proportion of reads assigned to the bacterium Vibrio pectenicida. Fulfilling Koch's postulates, V. pectenicida strain FHCF-3, cultured from the coelomic fluid of a diseased sunflower sea star, caused disease and mortality in exposed sunflower sea stars, demonstrating that it is a causative agent of SSWD. This discovery will enable recovery efforts for sea stars and the ecosystems affected by their decline by facilitating culture-based experimental research and broad-scale screening for pathogen presence and abundance in the laboratory and field.

Data represents 8 individual mortalities observed in sunflower sea stars exposed to sea star wasting disease (excluding 2 individuals that were exposed but did not die). Host responses are grouped into three types, arm twisting (‘twist'), arm autotomy (‘drop') and mortality (‘mort'). Symbols indicate the average number of days post exposure when disease responses were observed. The error bars indicate 1 s.e. We confirmed the presence of V. pectenicida in the inoculum used to start this experiment using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (Supplementary Table 11).

Source data

Lines indicate adjusted predicted values for stars within exposed (blue) and control (orange) treatment groups with 95% confidence intervals. Exposure methods include stars injected with coelomic fluid (‘CF'), tissue homogenate (‘homogenate'), or Vibrio pectenicida culture (‘culture'), and stars exposed to effluent water from a wasting sea stars tank (‘water'). Statistical results can be found in Supplementary Table 3.

Source data

Vibrio spp. 16S rRNA gene sequences were retrieved from the SILVA rRNA gene database (version 138.1) and the NCBI nr database (as of 14 November 2024). The maximum-likelihood phylogeny was built using 1,000 replicates, and rooted with sequences from two strains of Escherichia coli (NCBI Accessions CP033092 and MT215717) as an outgroup. Values on the nodes of the phylogeny represent bootstrap values. V. pectenicida strain FHCF-3 (isolated and sequenced in this study) is highlighted in red.

Wood is formed as plants expand in thickness through radial growth, which initiates after apical growth. At the onset of radial growth, dormant procambial cells in the vasculature become active and act as bifacial cambium stem cells, which produce xylem (wood) inward and phloem outward. Cytokinin has been implicated in radial growth initiation; however, its precise mechanisms, especially at the cellular level, remain unclear. Here we show a switching mechanism of radial growth, in which a cytokinin response maximum (CRM) transiently appearing in roots beyond the meristem induces stem cell activation. Manipulation of the CRM revealed that procambial cells primarily retain phloem differentiation competence but newly acquire xylem differentiation and self-renewal capabilities upon experiencing the CRM. Transcriptome analysis and mathematical modelling showed that the CRM is driven by cytokinin production and subsequent positive and negative signalling feedback loops. Our findings therefore demonstrate that a dynamic hormone response establishes multipotent stem cells de novo by providing proper competences to undifferentiated cells arising from the meristematic tissue, enabling the post-embryonic growth transition. This mechanism may serve as the basis for the vitality of plants, which continue to grow vigorously even after embryogenesis.

For months, researchers in a laboratory in Dallas, Texas, worked in secrecy, culturing grey-wolf blood cells and altering the DNA within. The scientists then plucked nuclei from these gene-edited cells and injected them into egg cells from a domestic dog to form clones.

They transferred dozens of the cloned embryos into the wombs of surrogate dogs, eventually bringing into the world three animals of a type that had never been seen before. Two males named Romulus and Remus were born in October 2024, and a female, Khaleesi, was born in January.

A few months later, Colossal Biosciences, the Texas-based company that produced the creatures, declared: “The first de-extinct animals are here.” Of 20 edits made to the animals' genomes, the company says that 15 match sequences identified in dire wolves (Aenocyon dirus), a large-bodied wolf species that last roamed North America during the ice age that ended some 11,500 years ago.

The company's announcement of the pups in April, which described them as dire wolves, set off a media maelstrom. The ensuing debates over the nature of the animals — and the advisability of doing such work — have opened a chasm between Colossal's team and other scientists.

“I don't think they de-extincted anything,” says Jeanne Loring, a stem-cell biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. She and many others say that the hype surrounding Colossal's announcement has the potential to confuse the public about what de-extinction technologies can achieve.

Colossal, meanwhile, has taken an increasingly combative tone in addressing criticisms, issuing rapid rebuttals to researchers and conservationists who have publicly questioned the company's work. The firm has also been accused of taking part in a campaign to undermine the credibility of some critics. The company denies having played any part in this.

Colossal stands by its claims and insists that it is listening to dissenters and seeking advice from them. “We have had this attitude of running towards critics, not away,” says Ben Lamm, a technology entrepreneur and co-founder of the company.

De-extinction is an emerging field that represents the meeting point of several groundbreaking biotechnologies: ancient genomics, cloning and genome editing, ostensibly in the service of conservation. The field has roots in science fiction, with the term seeming first to have appeared in a 1979 novel by Piers Anthony called The Source of Magic. And Michael Crichton's 1990 novel Jurassic Park — itself inspired by ancient-DNA investigations — popularized the possibility that long-dead organisms could be cloned from preserved DNA.

There has never been perfect agreement on what counts as de-extinction — such as whether it means cloning exact replicas of extinct species, creating proxies that fulfil their roles in ecosystems, or something in between. Some count the birth of a cloned bucardo (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica), a type of wild goat, as a first example. The animal's genome was transferred into goat (Capra hircus) egg cells from frozen cell samples taken from one of the last living bucardo specimens in 2000. (The resulting creature died within minutes of birth1.) But this pathway to de-extinction isn't an option for most species. DNA degrades over time, and without a sample of carefully preserved DNA, researchers would have to engineer the whole genome.

The advent of CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing in 2012 provided another option. Researchers can identify genetic variants that contribute to key traits of extinct animals and edit these variants into cells of living relatives. They can then use that manipulated DNA to create a new animal through cloning.

Plans to bring back animals such as the passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) and the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) began to flourish. Even though there was interest among researchers and the public, funding was an issue. “We had been unable to get really any philanthropic interest in de-extinction,” says Ben Novak, who leads a passenger-pigeon de-extinction effort at the non-profit organization Revive & Restore in Sausalito, California.

But in 2021, geneticist George Church at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who was working with Revive & Restore, caught a break. He teamed up with Lamm to launch Colossal Biosciences with US$15 million in funding, much of which came from venture capitalists. De-extinction of the woolly mammoth would be the firm's flagship project, using elephants as surrogates.

Beth Shapiro, an evolutionary geneticist who is chief scientific officer at Colossal, was initially sceptical that there was a strong conservation argument for creating elephants that had key mammoth traits. In 2015, she told Nature that her book on de-extinction, called How To Clone A Mammoth, might have been more accurately titled ‘How One Might Go About Cloning a Mammoth (Should It Become Technically Possible, And If It Were, In Fact, a Good Idea, Which It's Probably Not)'.

Shapiro turned down an offer to join the company at first, but started seriously entertaining the idea when Colossal expanded its de-extinction ambitions. It began projects to bring back the dodo (Raphus cucullatus), which was wiped out in the seventeenth century, and to restore thylacines (Thylacinus cynocephalus), the Australian marsupials that are sometimes referred to as Tasmanian tigers and that were hunted to extinction in the 1930s.

She was especially interested in seeing de-extinction technologies applied to existing endangered species. Shapiro joined Colossal in 2024 as its chief scientist. “This is an opportunity to scale up the impact that I have the potential to make,” she says. “Maybe it's a mid-life crisis.”

The company, now valued at around US$10 billion, has attracted celebrity investors, including the media personality Paris Hilton and film director Peter Jackson, alongside a handful of leading scientists as staff and advisers.

The dire-wolf project was different from many of Colossal's other efforts because it proceeded quietly. Few people knew about the work until this year, and that irked some researchers. “They didn't invite any kind of conversation about whether or not that is a good use of funds or a good project to do,” says Novak.

Shapiro says the secrecy around the dire-wolf project was designed to generate surprise, and to counter public perceptions that the company overpromises and under-delivers. She also says that the company talked extensively to scientists, conservationists and others about the project and how it should proceed.

The firm has not released the full list of edits that it made — 20 changes to 14 genome locations. Fifteen of the changes were identified in two dire-wolf genomes obtained from the remains of animals that lived 13,000 and 72,000 years ago. The genome differs from that of the grey wolf (Canis lupus) by about 12 million DNA letters.

Colossal says that other edits, including changes that led to the creatures' white coats and contributed to their large size, were intended to replicate dire-wolf traits using gene variants found in grey wolves. Many scientists say that the coat colour in particular was probably inspired more by the animals' appearance in the fantasy television series Game of Thrones than by reality.

“There is no chance in hell a dire wolf is going to look like that,” says Tom Gilbert, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Copenhagen and a scientific adviser to Colossal. He says he agrees with other scientists who have argued that, on the basis of what is known about the dire wolf's range, it “basically would have looked like a slightly larger coyote”. Colossal notes that the coat colour is based on the discovery of variants in two dire-wolf genomes that it says would have resulted in light-coloured fur.

According to an update from Colossal in late June, Romulus and Remus weigh around 40 kilograms, around 20% heavier than a standard grey wolf of the same age, and Khaleesi is about 16 kilograms. They live on an 800-hectare ecological preserve surrounded by a 3-metre wall. Colossal plans to make more of the animals, and to study their health and development in depth. It says it will not release them into the wild.

The mysterious extinction of the dire wolf

The mysterious extinction of the dire wolf

Shapiro argued in her 2015 book that forming a wild population is a requirement for successful de-extinction. She nevertheless considers the dire wolves to be an example of de-extinction, and says that creating them will have conservation benefits for wolves and other species.

Many scientists disagree. A group of experts on canids that advises the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) issued a statement in mid-April rejecting Colossal's claim that gene-edited wolves could be considered dire wolves, or even proxies for the extinct species. The statement cites a 2016 IUCN definition for de-extinction that emphasizes that the animal must fill an ecological niche. The work, the group said, “may demonstrate technical capabilities, but it does not contribute to conservation”. Colossal has disputed this on the social-media platform X (formerly Twitter) saying that the dire-wolf project “develops vital conservation technologies and provides an ideal platform for the next stage of this research”.

Novak says: “The dire wolf fits the Jurassic Park model of de-extinction beautifully.” The animals have the traits of extinct species and are, to his knowledge, not intended for release into the wild, he says. “It is clearly for spectacle.”

Gilbert, who was a co-author of a preprint describing the ancient dire-wolf genomes2, says he is concerned that Colossal is not being sufficiently clear to the public about what it has done. “It's a dog with 20 edits,” he says. “If you're putting out descriptions that are going to be so easily falsified, the risk is you do damage to science's reputation.”

Lamm rejects the idea that Colossal's messaging undermines public credibility in science, pointing to what he says was an overwhelmingly positive reaction.

Loring, who is part of an effort to use stem-cell technology in conservation, says that she sees merit in Colossal's work. It has, she says, changed her views on how to repopulate northern white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum cottoni). But she worries that Colossal's messaging overshadows those contributions. “It may create an opportunity for us to educate the public,” she says. “More often, it creates an opportunity for us to be ignored.”

To Love Dalén, a palaeogeneticist at the University of Stockholm and a scientific adviser to Colossal, the controversy is “a storm in a teacup” that detracts from Colossal's achievement. “It makes me a little bit sad there is this huge debate and angry voices about the common name,” he says.

Shapiro says she was surprised and saddened by the strength of reactions to Colossal's announcement. “It was harder than I thought it would be, and the questions were getting meaner and meaner,” she says.

The sense of touch is essential for humans to perceive, locate and react to physical stimuli. Notwithstanding the substantial advancements in e-skin research and related applications with collaborative robots and bionic prostheses, biomimetic intelligence remains a challenge in the attempt to understand and mimic somatosensory processing schemes. In this work, we present a large-area e-skin embedded with photonic fibre Bragg gratings, capable of decoding touch localization through a bioinspired two-layered spiking neuronal network. The implemented biomimicry of slowly adapting and fast-adapting type II primary afferents, cuneate neurons with overlapping receptive fields and neuroplasticity, enable unsupervised learning in localizing tactile stimuli with an error lower than 10 mm, and two-point discrimination thresholds matching human psychophysical thresholds in the forearm. These results align with biological findings and offer a promising step towards the development of bionic systems, opening new avenues for both practical applications and scientific explorations of somatosensation.

The tactile sense is essential to perceive and process information about the surroundings, allowing humans to establish social interactions, locate and react to external stimuli, and recognize features of what is being touched1,2,3,4,5. In addition, touch is fundamental for body preservation, through the identification and localization of innocuous contact events and harmful stimuli, enabling dexterity with fine control of touching behaviours and preventing damages and accidents3,6. This abundance of tactile information reflects the variety of tactile receptors that populate the human skin. Mechanical stimuli are, in fact, encoded by four main classes of primary afferents (PAs), also known as mechanoreceptors, that innervate glabrous skin. These mechanoreceptors are distinguished according to their adaptation to different stimuli. Slowly adapting receptors have a sustained response during the overall duration of the stimulus, whereas rapidly adapting receptors respond primarily to transients, such as the beginning or the end of an applied mechanical stimulus2,7,8. In addition, mechanoreceptors can be classified into two classes according to their location within the layers of the human skin. Type I mechanoreceptors present small receptive fields and are located near the epidermal surface. Among them, there are Merkel discs and Meissner corpuscles, which are slowly adapting type I (SAI) and fast-adapting type I (FAI) units, respectively. Conversely, Ruffini and Pacinian corpuscles are classified as slowly adapting type II (SAII) and fast-adapting type II (FAII) receptors, respectively, being located deeply in the dermis and having large receptive fields with obscure borders2,9,10. The cooperation of all these receptors fosters a human's ability to recognize and localize light and heavy touch, sustained pressure, vibrations, textures and fine features. The artificial implementation of these functionalities would be desirable in both industrial and biomedical applications in which awareness of the surroundings is a major requirement. As an example, collaborative robots need to interact safely with the environment and humans in various scenarios11,12,13, and users of bionic prostheses or exoskeletons would benefit from enhanced tactile information for a better embodiment and control of the artifacts14,15,16.

Thus, the development of biomimetic tactile systems, enriched by a thorough understanding of somatosensory learning mechanisms, would make it possible to equip robots with sensing devices capable of generalizing and adapting to new stimuli and develop more intuitive functional bionic devices for the restoration of sensory channels14,17,18. These needs have driven numerous research studies and the development of tactile sensors, based on electronic technologies, such as piezoresistive and capacitive elements, to implement bioinspired artificial skins3,11,17,19,20. Nevertheless, the deployment of these systems is still limited since they do not feature either the physiological skin shape flexibility and sensitivity distribution, given their rigid substrates and wiring issues, or the natural mechanism of efficient tactile information decoding4,11,13,21. Recently, fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors have proven to be a viable alternative for developing bioinspired e-skins, owing to their multiplexing properties, that is, the possibility to distribute multiple sensing units along a single optical fibre11,22. FBGs deeply placed in a silicone layer resembling human skin were proven to functionally mimic Ruffini mechanoreceptors, enabling the decoding of stimuli applied onto the e-skin by means of supervised learning methods11. However, biomimetic intelligence and the efficiency of somatosensory processing are still lacking in these systems, possibly because these biological mechanisms have not been completely and thoroughly understood yet21,23,24,25.

Currently, several models of tactile processing are based on analogies with vision due to its spatial accuracy21,26. However, touch sense mechanisms also present high temporal precision, with sensitivity to different frequency ranges, as it happens in the auditory system21,23,27,28. Recently, two bioinspired models have been proposed in tactile somatosensory computing for the classification of textures29 and edge orientation30. These models implemented a PA spike-time-dependent synaptic learning and a functional organization of the receptive fields of the higher processing structures inspired by the cuneate nucleus and somatosensory cortex, respectively. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no artificial biomimetic models in the literature that combine both paradigms—temporal and spatial precision—of the somatosensory system to localize tactile stimuli applied onto a large-area e-skin, grounding on the functional organization of overlapping receptive fields and on neuroplasticity dependent on the temporal precision of the signals originating from the PAs9,24,31,32,33,34.

Here we propose that a bioinspired sensory model, based on PAs and cuneate neurons (CNs), could infer the localization of mechanical indentations applied to a large-area e-skin, which resembles the human forearm and integrates photonic FBGs as transducers. Our approach is grounded on the hypothesis that the temporal to spatial conversion of tactile stimuli from the upper limb occurs in the cuneate nucleus9. This conversion is accomplished by coding the convergent and divergent patterns of PAs in CNs9,21,32. According to this model, it can be assumed that the cuneate nucleus is the first integration stage of the peripheral tactile inputs, and this integration enables the classification of tactile stimuli by the higher processing structures, such as the somatosensory cortex9,21,32,35, distributing the computational burden throughout the afferent pathways. The implementation of a model inspired by the biological PA–CN architecture in combination with a biomimetic large-area e-skin aims at artificially mimicking, to some extent, the natural sensory pathways, providing an engineering tool to support investigations on the neurophysiology of the human sense of touch.

The objective of this work was to develop a biomimetic intelligent tactile device based on bioinspired e-skin and two-layered spiking neuronal network (SNN) to localize indentations applied onto the e-skin (Fig. 1a). To this end, we first fabricated a curved, soft e-skin embedding 21 FBGs, whose receptive fields were accessed to evaluate its intrinsic sensitivity (Fig. 1b). The wavelength variations of the sensors, collected via an automatized force-controlled indentation protocol (Methods), were then processed through a model consisting of two neuronal layers. The first layer is based on first-order neurons that mimic type II mechanoreceptors of the human skin. The spiking output of these neurons is then conveyed to the second network layer, inspired by the cuneate nucleus intracellular dynamics through 1,036 functionally organized secondary neurons (CNs) and interneurons (INs)18,29 (Methods). To evaluate the proposed model, trained via a synaptic learning protocol based on calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity29, and consistent with the assumption that the tactile information is spatially interpreted in the cuneate nucleus9, we estimated the location of indentations applied onto the e-skin from the spiking activity of the implemented secondary neurons. In addition, we assessed the model features through comparisons with biological systems.

a, Two-layer SNN for the localization of stimuli onto the e-skin. The first layer is composed of 126 PAs that mimic type II mechanoreceptors (SAII and FAII). These PAs make excitatory synapses with both CNs (coloured filled triangles and dots) and inhibitory INs (coloured empty triangles). The INs convey inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSP) to the CNs (red, empty triangles). Both CNs and INs form the second layer of the network. The weights of the second-order neurons are trained through a calcium-dependent (CADP) synaptic rule. b, Large and overlapping receptive fields, with marked sensitive hotspots (dark blue), of three FBG sensors of the e-skin, mimicking type II PAs.

The developed artificial skin embedded 21 FBG sensors in a polymeric substrate to smoothly transmit the applied external loads to the optical sensors. The distribution of the optical sensing units was inspired by that of human mechanoreceptors in the forearm, with a higher density near the wrist11,36,37. In addition, the FBGs in the silicone substrate were arranged to somehow resemble the functional role of type II mechanoreceptors. Located deep in the dermis, these receptors present large overlapping receptive fields with different sizes and sensitivities and smooth borders7,37. The characterization of e-skin sensitivity, through the normalization of the FBG wavelength variations in response to quasi-static indentations (Methods), demonstrated that the sensor receptive fields resemble those of type II mechanoreceptors, exhibiting large receptive fields with a single marked hotspot and sensitivity overlapping with the neighbouring transducers (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1).

Given the functional similarity of the FBGs to type II mechanoreceptors, the first neuronal layer of the SNN was conceived to emulate SAII and FAII PAs. Hence, each sensor output was multiplied by a matrix of gains (Extended Data Table 1) and fed as an input current to six first-order neurons, four SAIIs and two FAIIs, consistent with the biological ratio among the density of type II mechanoreceptor families36, totalling 126 PAs (Methods). This architecture enabled the translation of the FBG wavelength variations (Δλ; Fig. 2b) and their derivatives (Fig. 2c), which scale with the indentation stimulus (Fig. 2a), into spike responses, generated through the regular spiking Izhikevich's neuron model (Fig. 2d)38. As the Ruffini endings encode skin stretches and show a sustained response to skin indentation2,39,40, the raw Δλ signals (Fig. 2b), encoding strains in the e-skin, were the inputs to the SAII model. The resulting firing rate was proportional to the applied load, which plateaus when stationary forces occur (Fig. 2e). The Δλ first temporal derivatives (Fig. 2c) were, instead, the sensory input to FAII afferents, since the Pacinian corpuscles encode transient tactile stimuli, that is, loading and unloading states (Fig. 2f)2,8. It is worth noticing that the behaviour of the SAII units (Fig. 2e) is valuable to decode contact intensity information, in line with biological hypotheses41. In particular, the more intense the applied force, the higher the firing rate of the slowly adapting mechanoreceptors (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Table 1). We also observed a discharge activity for high loads (greater than 3.5 N), as it happens in biological systems (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Table 1)42,43. As expected, we demonstrated that the average interspike intervals (ISIs) for each force range decrease with a higher intensity of the stimuli. The relationship between the logarithm of the ISI values and the logarithm of the percentage of the applied load is linear (Fig. 2h; Pearson correlation coefficient, ρ = 0.99; linear fitting polynomial: log[SAIIFiring Rate] = –0.38 Hz/N × log[Stimulus intensity, %] + 1.41 Hz; R2 = 0.98; average SAII firing rates and ISI in Supplementary Table 1), consistent with the results of the characterization of SAII units of the hairy skin of mammals, as it is that of the human forearm43. In addition, considering the dynamics of the mechanical indentations applied to the e-skin, the ISI range (approximately 50–100 ms) is consistent with neurophysiological findings43.

The two parameters are expressed in the logarithmic scale.

The second layer of the proposed SNN was designated to emulate the cuneate nucleus intracellular dynamics. It was composed of 1,036 functionally organized CNs and INs, each of the latter making an inhibitory synaptic connection with a CN (Fig. 1a). Biologically speaking, the CNs present complex receptive fields that, in general, are larger than that of PAs and comprise both excitatory and inhibitory subfields44. This enables sensitivity to specific spatial characteristics, allowing them to perform the spatial computation of tactile stimuli24,30,31. In addition, the cuneate nucleus has a functional somatotopic organization that may contribute to human tactile discrimination ability33,45,46. To provide our network model with these peculiar features, we defined the CN receptive fields, designed to include at least 12 PAs belonging to a specific region of the e-skin. Physiologically, convergent PAs with overlapping receptive fields, as it is in our system, determine larger secondary receptive fields44. Hence, each CN receives projections from the included PAs and these PAs could also establish connections with other secondary neurons, whose receptive field includes them. This connectivity entails that neighbour CNs have overlapping receptive fields, consistent with biological findings, according to which these overlaps are argued to implement input-feature segregation32. This approach generated a somatotopic map of the e-skin (Methods).

All the 126 PAs were provided to the 1,036 CNs as excitatory (wexc,i) and inhibitory (winh) synapses (Fig. 1a). The excitatory weights were initialized with the inverse of the Euclidean distance between the PAs and the functionally organized CNs within the receptive fields (Fig. 1a). Conversely, the weights of the mechanoreceptors outside the receptive field area were zeroed (Fig. 3a and Methods). The initial inhibitory weights winh were equal to 0.125 for all the implemented CNs29. A synaptic learning protocol based on calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity with a gradual synaptic weight transformation at each tactile stimulus presentation was performed (Methods). The post-learning excitatory synaptic weights and the evolution of the excitatory weights for one training fold are presented in Fig. 3b,c, respectively. The post-learning inhibitory synaptic weights are represented in Fig. 3d. It is worth noticing that the final winh values were close to 0 for all the CNs. This behaviour occurred because the update of winh values, which are responsible for regulating the firing rate of the CN calcium channels, was performed with a moving average of the firing rate of the last five indentation presentations, to avoid instability (Methods). Additionally, in the proposed SNN, most CNs should be silent depending on the site of the stimulus applied onto the e-skin, resulting in both low activity of the calcium channels and small winh. In general, the slowly adapting PAs had a greater potentiation (that is, increase) in their synaptic weights, especially in the case of SAIIs with higher firing activities (gains G3 and G4; Fig. 3b,c). The implemented synaptic learning rule potentiated the PA synapses that had high correlation with the CN total calcium activity. Therefore, the PA synapses with firing behaviour synchronized with the PAs having higher initial excitatory synaptic weights are more susceptible to potentiation of their synaptic weight18,29. This explains the substantial weight increase in SAIIs, given that the indentation task with plateaus (Fig. 2a) resulted in a higher firing rate for these afferents (Fig. 2d).

The spiking activity of 1,036 CNs was assessed for each indentation sample. The intensity of the firing of the CNs (Fig. 4b) was found to be qualitatively related to the force applied to the e-skin (Fig. 4a) during the indentations. The somatotopic maps in Fig. 4c show the spatial cumulative activations of the CNs during 1 s for two different loading conditions, that is, the first (~0.4 N) and the second (~2.3 N) level of the indentation force profile (Fig. 4a), respectively. It can be observed that the active area enlarges for higher stimulus intensities, with greater spiking activities inside the receptive field of the stimulated CN (Fig. 4c). This behaviour was also quantitatively demonstrated by grouping the CN responses of the whole indentation dataset by the force level, resulting in median numbers of active CNs of 329 (interquartile range (IQR) = [116, 450.75]) and 545 (IQR = [481, 685]) for the first and second force levels, respectively (Fig. 4d), with significant differences between the two loading conditions (Mann–Whitney U-test, P value = 0). In addition, as the applied load increases, the CN spiking activity intensifies with a monotonic increasing trend, consistent with the findings of studies on mammals (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2)47. In line with physiology, the modelled CNs presented bursting behaviours, reaching instantaneous spiking frequencies of nearly 1 kHz, where the increasing firing rate was supposed to encode the intensity of the stimulus24,32,48,49. In conclusion, it can be argued that both CN spatial activation on the modelled somatotopic map, provided by progressively recruiting PAs as the contact area increases32, and their spiking firing rates encode the intensity of the applied stimulus, consistent with neurophysiological findings on touch encoding50.

The median is indicated by a solid line within the box, whose edges represent the first and third quartiles; the whiskers extend to 1.5 times the IQR beyond the quartile boundaries.

To evaluate the two-layer SNN, we estimated the indentation location by computing the weighted average of all the CN spikes and the centroids of the spiking neurons over the e-skin somatotopic map (Methods). Figure 5 illustrates the neural activity of the CNs organized in the e-skin somatotopic map, the estimated locations weighted by the neural activity of the second-order neurons (weighted location) and the actual indentation site, for some indentations applied to different e-skin regions. We also report simulations of the real-time response of the model in terms of the weighted location estimation within a moving window (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2), evidencing its generalization capability.

For each sample indentation, the CN somatotopic map with neuron activations (left) and target and estimated location of the stimulus on the e-skin and error d, that is, Euclidean distance, between them (right) are shown.

We then calculated the location prediction error as the Euclidean distance between the weighted and target stimulus sites for all the indentation test points (Fig. 6a). The fourfold cross-validation resulted in a median location prediction error of 36.26 mm (IQR = [20.46 mm, 52.14 mm]) and 14.11 mm (IQR = [7.47 mm, 28.56 mm]) before and after the learning process, respectively (Supplementary Table 3 and Fig. 6b,c). Our results and the consistency of the prediction error achieved across the four folds (Supplementary Table 3) show that the proposed model is robust and has a high learning capability. In addition, we estimated contact positions through a simpler approach involving the calculation of the weighted average of the FBG Δλ (Methods). This resulted in a median error of 15.72 mm (IQR = [9.40 mm, 28.82 mm]) for the whole e-skin surface (Extended Data Fig. 3 shows a few prediction examples). The prediction errors of the different approaches for different regions of interest (ROIs) are represented in Fig. 6c (error values are listed in Supplementary Table 4). In general, this analysis resulted in larger localization errors at the edges of the e-skin. Conversely, the e-skin central region (ROI radius ≤ 45 mm), that is, the area with a higher density of sensors and in which the receptive fields of the CNs entirely map onto the e-skin surface, showed a median prediction error smaller than 10 mm for the SNN approach (Fig. 6b,c). In the same region, the estimation of the contact position through the weighted average of the FBG signals resulted, instead, in larger median errors and higher variability (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Table 4). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SNN approach for stimulus localization and its consistency with neurophysiological findings about the forearm tactile acuity (10–18 mm)51,52. Then, we investigated the temporal resolution of the developed spiking architecture for stimulus localization. After 10 ms from the onset of contact, the neuronal network was able to reach a median localization error of 14.36 mm (IQR = [8.17 mm, 25.24 mm]), which is similar to that achieved when considering longer time windows, such as 2 s (14.05 mm, IQR = [7.45 mm, 28.70 mm], Mann–Whitney U-test, P value = 0.51; Extended Data Fig. 4). These outcomes are consistent with some neurophysiological hypotheses on the dispersion of the latency (~14–28 ms) of stimulus transmission from the hand mechanoreceptors to the cuneate nucleus9.

The two-point discrimination threshold (th) of the e-skin is reported, too.

To demonstrate the generalization features of the SNN in localizing tactile stimuli onto the e-skin, the Weber two-point discrimination test was conducted using custom probes with tips at distances ranging from 0 mm to 60 mm (Supplementary Video 3). The analysis of the latency of the CN spiking responses resulted in a topographic map in which the minima were searched and identified as contact points. The latency maps for a single point and a 50-mm two-point indentation trial are represented in Fig. 6d,e, respectively. The minimum identifiable distance between the points was the CN receptive field radius44. The detection rates for each probe distance were computed (Supplementary Table 5) and a piecewise logistic curve was fitted to the data to determine the psychometric relationship (Fig. 6f; parameters a = 0.53, b = 0.35 mm−1, c = 35.26 mm and d = 0.27; Methods). The two-point discrimination threshold, that is, the probe distance value corresponding to a psychometric probability of 0.75, yielded 42.25 mm, consistent with neurophysiological findings on the discrimination of pairs of contacts on the human forearm (~30–45 mm)53,54.

This study investigated how a bioinspired SNN can decode tactile stimuli applied onto a biomimetic large-area e-skin, embedding FBG transducers in a soft polymeric substrate, starting from the hypothesis that the first stage of spatiotemporal decoding of tactile information occurs at the cuneate nucleus32. We attempted to functionally emulate the first- and second-order neurons of the somatosensory system, to further achieve its computational and learning efficiency. To this aim, we first developed a forearm-shaped e-skin, whose sensor arrangement and receptive fields were intended to morphologically mimic type II mechanoreceptors of the human skin (Fig. 1b)7,11,36,37. Physiologically, the human arm has a tactile innervation density of 12 units cm−2 (ref. 36), which results in approximately 1,800 PA innervation distributed over an area of 150 cm2 (the approximate e-skin area), with hundreds of PAs sending projections onto a single CN9. Considering this, the artificial morphological reproduction of the tactile decoding channels is still a challenge, given the current technological limitations of most sensing systems that prevent the development of extremely sensor-dense devices4,18,21,55. Our approach benefited from the high integrability and multiplexing of FBG sensors and leveraged on the modelling of six sensory afferents per FBG. Through the proposed calibration of the Izhikevich model of regular spiking neurons38,56,57,58,59, the resulting 126 PAs recreated a variety of firing dynamics, mimicking fast and slowly adapting mechanoreceptors, whose activity encoded stimulus transients and intensities, respectively (Fig. 2)7,8,43. The modelled PAs sent projections onto the 1,036 CNs and INs of the SNN second layer, emulating the biological connectivity of the cuneate nucleus (Fig. 1a). Inspired by physiology, the CNs were designed to have large overlapping receptive fields, thereby realizing a somatotopic map of the e-skin. This spatial organization in combination with the unsupervised learning rule, based on the CN intracellular dynamics and a heuristic initialization of the synaptic excitatory weights (Fig. 3), were paramount for the localization of tactile stimuli through the spiking activity of the secondary neurons18,29,32,44. Our SNN model was proven to be effective in estimating the indentation location under varying conditions of force and position (Fig. 5), with a median error of about 14 mm and less than 10 mm in the central region of the e-skin (Fig. 6b,c). Physiologically, the human ability of stimulus localization and tactile acuity are enhanced in body regions with a higher density of mechanoreceptors, such as the fingers36,60. Despite the low density of sensors in the e-skin, our SNN allowed to reach results consistent with neurophysiological findings51,52, with median errors and variability lower than those directly obtained from the FBG signals on the considered ROIs through a non-bioinspired approach (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Table 4). Additionally, our model intrinsically enabled discrimination between two contact points without any further training, an outcome that was enabled by the implemented bioinspired learning paradigm, confirming the generalization properties of our SNN. The model two-point discrimination threshold of about 42 mm aligns with that of the human forearm53,54 and conforms to the theory of convergence of PAs with broad receptive fields44 (Fig. 6f). The stimulus localization on the e-skin was enabled by both CN topographic organization and firing activity (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 4). Spatiotemporal coding strategies were also observed in regions of the somatosensory cortex61 and hypothesized to occur even at the cuneate-nucleus level9. We also observed that the spiking activity of the CNs, as well as the extension of the active area on the e-skin, is correlated with the intensity of the applied stimulus (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 2), in line with evidence on mammals47 and with the hypotheses that input-feature segregation may occur in the cuneate nucleus24,32,48,49.

This study, thus, demonstrates that the bioinspired design of both e-skin and two-layered SNN, supported by biological findings, enabled the unsupervised learning of skin-contact localization over large areas with the feasibility of generalization to more complex stimuli. This outcome can offer both technological and scientific applicability.

First, this achievement supports the perspective of transferring our approach to real-world applications, such as bionics and robotics. Tactile feedback could be provided to persons with disabilities, such as prosthesis users or quadriplegic subjects, by means of either invasive intraneural or intracortical stimulation or non-invasive wearable interfaces62. The restoration of the disrupted sensory pathways should elicit natural sensations, for which intuitive and biomimetic feedback is required63,64. Although our bioinspired e-skin holds a huge potential for integration in bionic devices, given its mechanical conformability and its robustness to unstructured setting interferences, the bulkiness of the optoelectronic interrogator prevented its applicability in real sensory restoration architectures so far. However, the recent advancements of miniaturized photonics will boost the deployment of FBG-based e-skin in bionics, promising major breakthroughs in the near future65,66.

Considering the robotics scenarios of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, the implementation of biomimetic intelligence, in combination with large-area e-skins on machines, is essential for safe interactions with the surroundings4,11,13,67. The new generation of robots should autonomously navigate and operate in unstructured environments and cooperate with humans in various workspaces, ranging from industrial production to medical and rehabilitation care11,68,69,70. For most applications, collaborative machines require a spatial resolution of 10–40 mm (ref. 71), which is consistent with the performance of our system. The artificial emulation of the natural tactile sensory pathways in robots could foster human-like responsiveness and enable more efficient computations and hardware resource usage, as that in biological systems13. In addition, biomimetic e-skins are promising for the integration of non-invasive sensory feedback interfaces, which could enhance safety and collaborative tasks in the telepresence and teleoperation frameworks72. In these scenarios, where intuitiveness and efficiency are required73, our system entails a huge potential for real-time deployment, given its architecture based on event-driven processing. Online implementation of soft neuromorphic models has been demonstrated to be feasible via the Euler method, selecting the discretization timing in the millisecond scale to guarantee the convergence of artificial neurons firing in the order of tens of hertz typical of the human somatosensory system, in a trade-off between the overall accuracy and convergence and the computational burden74. In addition, the ongoing advancements of neuromorphic hardware solutions hold promise to surpass the powerful, but costly, conventional electronics of deep learning accelerators13,75. Future works will target the on-chip deployment of our SNN, aiming at parallel energy-efficient hardware architectural processing instead of algorithmic implementations.

Regarding the contribution to neuroscientific research, in this work, we provided modelling evidence supporting, to some extent, the plausible hypothesis that the cuneate nucleus is the first stage of tactile information interpretation, through overlapping receptive fields and the capacity to convert spatiotemporal spiking codes of the PAs into spatiotemporal features and functionalities, tasks previously attributed mainly to the somatosensory cortex31,32,34,76. Nevertheless, the functional role of the cuneate nucleus in somatosensory processing is not yet fully understood, due to the complexity of performing intracellular recordings in this structure77,78. Our model, as an open-access neurocomputational machine intelligence tool79, can serve as an engineering enabler for the investigation of second-order neuron functions. It offers tools to evaluate the functional effect of neuronal architectures applied to electrophysiological recordings that may be available in future investigations of the somatosensory system, with particular reference to the encoding of stimulus intensity and localization by second-order neurons.

The experimented e-skin (Extended Data Fig. 5) had size and shape similar to those of the human forearm. To mimic biomechanical compliance, a soft silicone polymer (Dragon Skin 10 medium, Smooth-On) was used to realize a flexible patch to embed an optical fibre with 21 FBG sensors. It was fabricated by a three-step process11: (1) a first silicone pouring in a custom mould to obtain a bottom layer with a groove; (2) the embedding of the fibre along the grooved path; (3) a second silicone pouring to cover the fibre itself and provide robustness to the patch. The e-skin was then attached to a custom three-dimensionally printed plastic support to guarantee stability. The optically sensitive elements were FBGs (length, 10 mm) distributed along the designed path running throughout the e-skin resemble the sensitivity features of the human forearm, that is, with an increasing density from the proximal to distal parts. These gratings are interference patterns inscribed within the core of a single optical fibre. When broadband spectrum light, sent by means of an optoelectronic interrogator, passes through the fibre cable and hits an FBG, it is partly back-reflected to the input point, as a spectral peak centred at a characteristic wavelength, λB:

where neff is the effective refractive index of the optical fibre and Λ is the pitch of the specific grating80. The λB value of the e-skin FBGs were, hence, defined by fabrication and ranged between 1,520 nm and 1,580 nm with a step of 3 nm. Wavelength shifts occur when a deformation is applied to the sensor11, thereby allowing the encoding of tactile stimuli. Considering this feature and to reduce the effects of potential prestrains that could have impacted the residual deformability of the sensors in response to external tactile stimuli, the FBGs were arranged on straight fibre segments.

The training and validation of the proposed model required the collection of a dataset of indentations applied over the e-skin surface. For this purpose, an automatized indentation protocol was executed, with 1,846 target points to touch, computed as the centroids of the triangles of a random mesh of the skin surface. A bimanual robotic platform, consisting of two anthropomorphic arms (Racer-5-0.80, Comau), was programmed to cooperate during the indentation protocol (Extended Data Fig. 5): one robot performed the tactile tasks, whereas the other held and oriented the e-skin. The indenting robot reached each target site perpendicularly, touching the skin with a spring-like hemispherical probe attached to the end-effector. Force feedback measured by means of a load cell (Nano 43, ATI Industrial Automation), mounted at the base of the indenter, was provided to control the robot to release the contact when exceeding a threshold (2.5 N) and then fly to a new target point. The control code consisted of dedicated routines (LabVIEW, National Instruments) running on both an industrial controller (IC-3173, National Instruments), to send commands to the robots, and a PC, for managing and checking the experiments. During the indentation sessions, force and FBG signals, the latter read by means of an optical interrogator (FBG Scan 904, FBGS Technologies), were collected at a 100-Hz rate, and saved into text files together with the Cartesian coordinates of the contact sites.

The receptive fields of the FBG sensors populating the skin were represented as two-dimensional contour maps depicting the spatial distribution of sensitivity to contact force. Hotspot regions in dark blue indicate the maximum sensitivity (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1). To obtain the FBG receptive fields, the wavelength variation signals (Δλ) from each FBG sensor were averaged over 500 ms captured on the highest force plateau, that is, the second force level, and divided by its average value. The obtained results were then normalized with respect to the highest FBG sensitivity value, to have sensitivity maps ranging from 0 to 1. This procedure was performed using all the available indentation samples.

The 21 FBG signals were the input of the PA models. Each sensor signal was resampled at a frequency of 1 kHz to establish a regular firing dynamics consistent with the discretization of the Izhikevich neuronal model74. The FBG signal derivatives were computed to obtain the dynamic components of the indentations, that is, the loading and unloading phases of the varying force levels applied to the e-skin. The absolute values of both raw and differentiated signals were calculated to feed the Izhikevich neurons as input current I, to mimic the adaptation dynamics and firing response of type II mechanoreceptors, that is, Ruffini endings (SAII) and Pacini corpuscles (FAII)38. To simulate the physiology of type II PAs in terms of the ratio between slowly and fast-adapting units, that is, two SAIIs to one FAII36, their diverse sensitivity and the different-sized overlapping receptive fields, the raw absolute FBG signals and their derivatives were multiplied by four and two distinct gains. Hence, six mechanoreceptor models were considered for each FBG sensor (Fig. 2), resulting in 126 input currents for the first-order neuron models. Extended Data Table 1 shows the gains used for the SAII and FAII models. The SAII gains were selected through some pilot tests and empirical analyses, where we assessed whether the increase in gain was generating an increase in the firing rate within the physiological range documented in the literature43. Specifically, the average ISIs (that is, the inverse of the average firing rates) corresponding to each force range were computed, and their logarithmic values were fitted to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity percentage (force values normalized by the maximum of 4 N; Fig. 2h). The results were then compared with background neurophysiological findings43, particularly to the ISI characterization of SAII units. The FAII gains were selected following the same empirical approach, that is, by evaluating the spiking activity at load transients. It is worth noticing that a general procedure for establishing the gains of the input currents of the Izhikevich model for artificial mechanoreceptor simulation has not yet been established in the literature. Thus, several studies, such as ref. 58, reported this empirical method of gain selection according to the specific application.

The Izhikevich model consists of a system of differential equations that can be solved via the Euler method74. Equation (2) describes the dynamics of the membrane potential v of the neuron; equation (3) represents the recovery variable u, responsible for the repolarization of the neural membrane; equation (4) describes the membrane potential restoration and the recovery variable update when v reaches the 30-mV firing threshold:

where A, B, and C are standard variables of the Izhikevich model; t represents time; a is the timescale of u; b is the sensitivity of u to the membrane potential; c is the membrane resting potential value; and d modulates the dynamics of the after-spike reset of the recovery variable u. For the implemented mechanoreceptors, we choose the parameters Gainn (Extended Data Table 1) that reproduced a regular firing behaviour.

The activity of type II mechanoreceptors was analysed to investigate relationships with the intensity of the applied load. For this purpose, the perpendicular force profile was extracted for all the 1,846 indentations. For each indentation, SAII and FAII units were considered separately. First, their corresponding firing rates were calculated on moving time windows of 100 ms, with an overlap of 50 ms. For each window, the firing rate was extracted as follows:

where the subscript X indicates the type of mechanoreceptor (SAII or FAII), wt is the duration of the time window, NspikesX is the number of spikes of the X units in wt and NneuronXactive is the number of active neurons of each type in the selected window. The resulting firing rates were compared with the corresponding force profile (Fig. 2a–f). Then, the SAII firing rates were grouped for force levels, ranging from 0 to 4 N, with a step of 0.5 N. The corresponding distributions were analysed and the relevant statistics computed (median values and first and third quartiles; Fig. 2g and Supplementary Table 1). For each load-intensity level, the mean SAII firing rate value was extracted to further derive the relationship with the applied loads. For that, the linear Pearson correlation coefficient ρ was calculated. Then, the first-order polynomial that fitted the logarithm of the SAII average firing rates to the logarithm of the percentage of the applied load, normalized by 4 N, was extrapolated. The R2 coefficient was computed to assess the goodness of the linear fit (Fig. 2h).

The second layer of the SNN was composed of 1,036 CNs, modelled with the mathematical implementation based on the exponential integrate-and-fire approach29. This model reproduces the complete dynamics of the membrane potential of CNs, as described in equation (5), along with a detailed modelling of the activity of low-threshold voltage-gated calcium channels and calcium-activated potassium channels:

In equation (5), Cm is the capacitance of the neural membrane; Vm is the CN membrane potential; IL is the leak current of the neuron (equation (6)); Ispike is the spike current that recreates the action potential onset and the fast neuron depolarization (equation (7)); Iion is the ionic current resulting from the summation of the currents of voltage-gated calcium channels (ICa) and calcium-activated potassium channels (IK; equation (8)); Iext is the external current that can be injected into the neuron (in this study, it is equal to 0); and Isyn is the synaptic current (equation (9)), where each synapse (i) is activated by a PA.

where wexc,i is the excitatory synaptic weight; t* is the time at which a spike occurs and winh is the inhibitory synaptic weight. Isyn can be, hence, expressed as the sum of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents of all the synapses of the individual PAs. The definitions of the other variables and their respective values are reported in Supplementary Table 6.

The current ICa is described by equation (10) and the current IK, by equation (11):

where \({\bar{g}}_{{{\rm{Ca}}}}\) and \({\bar{g}}_{{\rm{K}}}\) are the maximum conductance; ECa and EK are the action potentials of the calcium and potassium channels, respectively; and xCa,a, xCa,i, \({x}_{{{\rm{K}}}_{{{\rm{Ca}}}}}\) and \({x}_{{{\rm{K}}}_{{{\rm{V}}_{\rm{m}}}}}\) are the activity states of the channels. These values are provided in Supplementary Table 6.

In this model, both ion channels (xCa,a and xCa,i) are considered as sources of the membrane calcium concentration of the CN ([Ca2+]). Thus, we proposed that the activity of the total neuron calcium concentration follows equation (12).

The relevant parameters are reported in Supplementary Table 2.

To functionally mimic the organization of the cuneate nucleus, we generated an e-skin grid mesh with 29 × 38 edges, that is, 28 × 37 subregions. In this mesh, each subregion represented a CN, and its centroid represented the centre of its receptive field. In total, 1,036 CNs were created with circular overlapping receptive fields of 41.67-mm radius each. The criterion for the definition of the size of the CN receptive field was to include at least two FBG sensors in the corresponding sensitive area of the e-skin and, thus, 12 PAs, consistent with the number of dominant PAs that project into a CN found in neurophysiological studies on mammals and simulations of human tactile perception24. This approach allowed us to determine a CN somatotopic map of the e-skin.

In our model, each of the 1,036 CNs was fully connected to the 126 PAs, with excitatory weights ranging from 0 to 1, and to a single inhibitory synapse (Fig. 1a, red triangle), with an IN that grouped the responses of all the 126 PA projections (Fig. 1a, coloured empty triangles). This connectivity enabled the potentiation or depression of all the synaptic weights during the learning process. In this model, the magnitude of the postsynaptic potential projected into a CN for a given sensory input is dependent on both excitatory (wexc,i) and inhibitory (winh) weights, as described in equation (9)18,29. The presynaptic excitatory weights were initialized as the inverse of the Euclidean distances between the position of the 21 FBG sensors in the skin and the 1,036 centroids of the CNs. Then, the obtained values were rescaled between 0.2 and 1. The initial excitatory weights (wexc) of the PAs corresponding to the sensors outside the area of the CN receptive fields were instead set to 0 (Fig. 1a, coloured dots). In this way, only the mechanoreceptors inside the CN receptive field region had initial weights greater than 0 (Fig. 1a, coloured filled triangles). All the inhibitory synaptic weights (winh) were instead initialized to 0.125.

Inspired by calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity, we implemented a synaptic learning process29, where the total inhibitory weights (winh) and presynaptic excitatory weights (wexc,i) were updated at each stimulus presentation. According to our model, the excitatory weight potentiation of the presynaptic neurons (PAs) occurred when the total calcium activity (\({A}_{{{\rm{Tot}}}}^{{{{\rm{Ca}}}}^{2+}}\)) of the CN, as in equation (13), was strongly correlated with the local calcium activity (\({A}_{{{\rm{Loc}}}_{i}}^{{{{\rm{Ca}}}}^{2+}}\)) of a synapse (PA with the secondary neuron; equation (14)); otherwise, this synapse was depressed:

where \({A}_{{Tot}}^{{{Ca}}^{2+}}\) is the total calcium activity of the CN; kact = 1 is an arbitrary constant; \({A}_{\rm{Loc}_{i}}^{{\rm{Ca}}^{2+}}\) is the local calcium activity due to a synapse i; τr = 4 ms is the rise time; τd = 12.5 ms is the decay time; τl = 0 ms is the latency time; τl = 21 ms is a constant to calculate the ratio; and t* is the time at which a PA spike occurs. To reach supralinearity in the local calcium activity, we used an approximative approach of subtracting an offset, that is, the 75% of the single-pulse activation peak activity, from the local calcium signal, and this resulting value was used as the local calcium activity (\({A}_{{{\rm{Loc}}}}^{{{{\rm{Ca}}}}^{2+}}\)), as proposed in ref. 29.

In the model, the individual excitatory weights actualization occurred during the presentation of each stimulus during the learning phase, and it is described as the integral of the correlation between local calcium activity (\({A}_{\rm{Loc}}^{{\rm{Ca}}^{2+}}\)) and total calcium activity (\({A}_{\rm{Tot}}^{{\rm{Ca}}^{2+}}\)), following equation (15):

where \({{{\rm{Avg}}}}_{{A}_{{\mathrm{tot}}}^{{{\mathrm{Ca}}}^{2+}}}\) is the average of the last three values of the total calcium activity; SynEQ is the synaptic equilibrium defined as a linear function of the total excitatory synaptic weight with a dual slope having point 0 in 10 (decay = 0.04, if ∑wexc < SynEQ; decay = 0.12, if ∑wexc > SynEQ); and K is a constant gain factor defined by the sigmoid function represented in equation (16), with a gain step on the slope of 0.005.

To avoid instabilities in synaptic learning, it was necessary to average the calcium activity; thus, the learning threshold was obtained by multiplying the average of the total calcium activity \({{\rm{Avg}}}_{{A}_{{\mathrm{tot}}}^{{{\mathrm{Ca}}}^{2+}}}\) by the synaptic equilibrium SynEQ.

Although the inhibitory synaptic learning is based on the firing rate of the CN calcium channels, winh, initially set to 0.125, is responsible for regulating the total activity of the calcium channels in the CN. Thus, the low activity of calcium channels was counteracted with a decrease in winh, and vice versa. For the model implemented in this work, winh was used to maintain the firing frequency of the calcium channels at a predefined set point of 20 Hz, and the update of winh was given by a dual-slope function zeroing at this set point. The synaptic learning protocol is summarized in a pseudo-code in the Supplementary Text.

The synaptic learning process was evaluated through a fourfold validation, such that for each training fold, 1,385 indentation samples were shuffled and presented to the model, thereby totalling 1,385 training cycles. In this step, only 1 s of data was used, including the beginning of the second indentation step (that is, the highest force level for each indentation). These data were the spikes (binary vector) of the first neuronal layer of mechanoreceptors (PAs). All the synaptic learning processes were separately performed for each of the 1,036 CNs.

After the synaptic learning, the spike responses of 1,036 CNs were calculated for the indentations of each validation fold and processed to derive the stimulus intensity and location information.

To demonstrate the increase in CN spiking activity when progressively higher loads were applied, the cumulative spike numbers inside the receptive field of the stimulated CN were computed for different loading conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2). To this aim, we evaluated the CN spikes in a 1-s window at the beginning of each of the two plateaus of the indentation force profile. In addition, the spatial activations of the CNs for the different force levels were explored. In this regard, the number of active CNs was calculated for the two load conditions and 1,655 of the applied indentations (Fig. 4d). A Mann–Whitney U-test test with a 0.05 significance level was performed to investigate whether the spatially distributed responses of the CNs could encode information on different intensities of the applied tactile stimuli.

Regarding the prediction of the contact position, the spikes of the CNs were first summed over the indentation duration window. The sum of each neuron spike (Nspki) was then used for the weighted location estimation, as described in equation (17).

where WLx,y is the location estimation in the skin x–y plane (considering the two-dimensional projection of the e-skin surface) weighted by the neural activation of the CNs (weighted position); Nspki is the number of spikes of a neuron in a time window; i is the CN ID (from 1 to 1,036); and NiLocx,y is the position of the centroid of a second-order neuron in the x–y plane of the modelled functionally organized cuneate nucleus. We estimated the weighted location on a 1-s sliding window with an overlap of 100 ms. To evaluate the location prediction error, we calculated the Euclidean distance between the real position of the indentation on the e-skin and the estimated weighted location (Fig. 5).

In addition, we compared the localization performance of the SNN with those achieved through the weighted average of the 21 FBG sensor wavelengths (FBG WLx,y), calculated as follows:

where Δλi and (xFBG, yFBG)i are the wavelength variation and two-dimensional coordinates of the ith FBG sensor, respectively. The FBG-based weighted average was computed for each timestamp of the corresponding non-zero force values. Then, the average location and Euclidean distance were calculated to obtain a single estimation and a single error value per indentation of the test sets of the four folds (Extended Data Fig. 3). The performance of both neuronal network and FBG weighted average in localizing the test stimuli were also assessed considering ROIs of different sizes. Starting from the centre of the skin, circular areas with an increasing radius-delimited (from 20 mm to 55 mm) portions of the e-skin surface were used to compute the contact estimation error, considering that all the test indentations fell inside the circular region. Median and IQR error values were calculated for each region size, grouping the results of the four cross-validation folds (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Table 4).

We then evaluated the temporal resolution of our system to localize the applied indentations. Specifically, considering that the sensors of the e-skin tracked the dynamics of the applied loading and unloading transients (Fig. 2a–c), we estimated the minimum amount of time needed by the trained SNN to reach its best localization performance. This approach aimed at investigating the stimulus conduction time from the simulated forearm mechanoreceptors, that is, the FBG sensors, to the modelled CNs, designated to localize contacts onto the e-skin. We computed the model localization error (median and IQR) on the second step of the force profile on time windows of different lengths, ranging from 10 ms to 2 s, the latter being the duration of the complete second level of the force profile. The two extreme conditions were statistically compared with a level of significance (α) of 0.05.

To apply two-point stimuli onto the e-skin through the two-point discrimination test (Supplementary Video 3), a set of custom probes was designed (Fusion 360, Autodesk) and three-dimensionally printed in polylactic acid (Ultimaker S5). The probes featured one or two hemispherical tips (radius, 1.5 mm) with distances ranging from 20 mm to 60 mm, with a step of 5 mm. Each probe was attached to a handle stick by means of a conical spring fixed to a sliding structure, which provided the tool with a translational perpendicular degree of freedom. This structure presented a blocking mechanism so that the tool could be pushed until bottoming out, allowing to control the applied force. Ten experimenters participated in the trials, which consisted of manually indenting the e-skin by means of each of the above-mentioned probes in seven random locations. The single-probe trials were repeated before each of those with two-tip probes. At each indentation, the experimenter had to gently land on the e-skin with the probe, stabilize the posture, push the tool until the descent was not blocked and keep it for 3 s. The protocol instructions and the timing of the different indentation phases were displayed via a custom graphical user interface developed in LabVIEW 2019 (National Instruments). The same software routine allowed us to store the FBG sensor signals, collected by means of an optical interrogator (FBG Scan 904, FBGS Technologies), the corresponding timestamps and the trial information into text files for further analysis. The recordings of the FBG wavelengths were, at first, segmented to focus on the period when the probe was pressed against the e-skin. A Δλ threshold of 0.003 nm was considered to identify the onset of the contact, that is, when at least one sensor signal exceeded it for 200 ms. This corresponded to the beginning of the landing phase. Then, to identify the onset of indentation, a second threshold, that is, twice the average absolute wavelength of all the sensors during the 1 s after the e-skin was touched, was considered. The start of the stimulus corresponded to the moment when the mean value of all the FBG Δλ values exceeded this threshold for at least 500 ms. The resulting indentation portions were zero padded with 500-ms periods to simulate the transition from non-contact to contact states. Given the variability of indentations performed manually by the experimenters, some trials were discarded (Supplementary Table 5). The obtained FBG signals for the selected indentations were fed into the pretrained neuronal model to get the spiking response of the 1,036 CNs. Then, the neuronal response latency was determined within a 200-ms temporal window starting from the first CN spike. These latencies were organized topographically (Fig. 6d,e); hence, a 3 × 3 Gaussian spatial filter (σ = 0.5) was applied. The lowest minimum in the resulting latency map was identified as the first contact point. Then, the occurrence of a second minimum was checked outside a circular region corresponding to the size of the CN receptive field44. If two distinct minima were found following this criterion, it was determined that two contact points were applied to the e-skin. The two-point detection rates were then estimated for all the trials, and a psychometric curve was fitted to them. The resulting piecewise logistic function had the following expression:

Finally, the 0.75 probability, that is, when F(x) was 0.75, was considered to determine the e-skin two-point discrimination threshold (Fig. 6f).

What determines who becomes and stays friends? Many factors are linked to friendship, including physical proximity and interpersonal similarities. Recent work has leveraged neuroimaging to detect similarities among friends by capturing how people process the world around them. However, given the cross-sectional nature of past research, it is unknown if neural similarity precedes friendship or only emerges among friends following social connection. Here we show that similarities in neural responses to movie clips—acquired before participants met one another—predicted proximity in a friendship network eight months later (that is, participants with similar responses were more likely to be friends rather than several degrees of separation apart). We also examined changes in distances between participants in their shared social network, which resulted from the formation, persistence and dissolution of friendships, between two months and eight months after they met each other. Compared with people who drifted further apart, people who grew closer over this six-month period had been more neurally similar as strangers. In addition, analyses controlling for sociodemographic similarities showed that whereas these similarities appeared to drive the differences in pre-existing neural similarities between friends and dyads of a social distance of 3, they did not account for the more extensive links between pre-existing neural similarities and the tendency for people to grow closer together, rather than drift farther apart, over time. Thus, whereas some friendships may initially form due to circumstance and dissolve over time, later-emerging and longer-lasting friendships may be rooted in deeper interpersonal compatibilities that are indexed by pre-existing neural similarities. The localization of these results suggests that pre-existing similarities in how people interpret, attend to and emotionally respond to their surroundings are precursors of future friendship and increased social closeness.

Humans tend to cluster in their real-world social networks according to similarities in their demographic characteristics, such as age, gender and ethnicity, as well as in their behaviours and preferences1,2,3,4,5. This tendency to surround oneself with similar others, a phenomenon known as homophily, is a ubiquitous property of human social networks that has been observed across wide-ranging contexts, from modern industrialized societies to hunter-gatherer communities and online communities1,6,7,8. Such inter-individual similarities in demographic characteristics, behaviours and preferences may reflect similarities in how friends think about and respond to the world around them.

To investigate this possibility, prior work has attempted to relate inter-individual similarities in self-report-based measures of personality traits (for example, Big Five personality traits) to how close people are in their social network. However, this approach has yielded null or inconsistent results9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18, suggesting that traditional approaches using personality surveys or questionnaires may not be sensitive to the types of inter-individual similarities that characterize friends. More recent work has demonstrated that inter-individual similarity in thoughts, feelings and beliefs about the world (that is, a “generalized shared reality”) is predictive of social connection between individuals19. Consistent with this notion, a growing body of research has demonstrated that people closer together in their real-world social networks (that is, who are fewer degrees of separation from one another) are characterized by similarities in neuroanatomy, neural responses to watching naturalistic stimuli (that is, audiovisual movies) and patterns of neural activity at rest20,21,22,23. Although these studies demonstrate the utility of neuroimaging in probing the types of similarities that are shared among friends, their cross-sectional nature limits the types of inferences that can be made about the relationship between neural similarity and social network proximity. For example, the previously observed relationships between neural similarity and social network proximity may arise purely from people who were already friends becoming similar to one another due to social influence, contagion or exposure to common environments and experiences as a result of proximity in their social networks. Here we leveraged a longitudinal study design to test whether pre-existing similarities in neural responses to naturalistic stimuli (prior to meeting one another) predicted future proximity in a real-world friendship network eight months later, and whether pre-existing neural similarity was also associated with increases in social closeness over time.

A subset of individuals in a graduate student cohort participated in our functional MRI (fMRI) study (NfMRI = 41) before the beginning of their programme (Time 1). The majority of fMRI participants were scanned shortly after their arrival on campus to limit the opportunities that they had to interact with and befriend one another (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). During the fMRI study, the participants watched a series of naturalistic audiovisual stimuli (that is, movie clips). Movie clips spanning a wide range of styles (for example, documentary, comedy and debate) and topics (for example, food, science/technology, sports, environment and social events) were selected to fulfill several key criteria. Specifically, we sought clips that participants would be unlikely to have seen before, that would minimize mind-wandering by being sufficiently interesting to keep participants' thoughts and attention focused on the stimuli and that would elicit meaningful individual differences in neural responses—for example, because different people might have different temporal trajectories of emotional reactions or attentional allocation, interpret differently or attend to different aspects of the stimuli (see Methods for more details about stimulus selection). We then characterized the complete social network of this cohort two months later (after the beginning of their academic programme; Time 2) and again six months later (Time 3). For each unique pair of fMRI participants, pre-existing neural similarities were characterized at Time 1, and social distance was characterized at Times 2 and 3 (Fig. 2).

A subset of students in a graduate programme (red nodes; N = 41) participated in the fMRI study before the start of their first year of the programme (Time 1). Most of the participants were scanned shortly after arriving on the campus (median number of days between arrival and fMRI scan, 3; modal number of days between arrival and fMRI scan, 1; see Methods for details). Two months later (Time 2), every student in the programme participated in a social network survey (N = 288; 100% response rate). The majority of these students (N = 287; 99.6% response rate) completed the social network survey again six months after Time 2 (Time 3). Their social networks at Time 2 and at Time 3 were reconstructed using these data. The visualizations of the social networks at Time 2 and Time 3 were generated using the Large Graph Layout algorithm76 in igraph64; note that there is some stochasticity in the determination of nodes' positions within graphs using this algorithm. Each node represents a study participant, and an edge connects two nodes if there is a mutually reported (that is, reciprocal) friendship.

a, Participants' data were resampled to standard space and parcellated into 200 brain regions using the Schaefer et al.42 parcellation scheme. Each region is associated with a brain network from the Yeo et al.43 seven-network parcellation, signified by different colours. For each region, the mean neural response was extracted at each time point during the fMRI scan, yielding a mean neural response time series. This was repeated for each participant. For a given pair of fMRI participants, the similarity of their neural response time series in each brain region at Time 2 was calculated using Pearson's r. b,c, For each pair of fMRI participants, the geodesic distance between them in the social network of their academic cohort was calculated at Time 2 (b) and at Time 3 (c).

If pre-existing neural similarities truly reflect deep interpersonal compatibilities, we reasoned that such similarities may be particularly predictive of friendships after students have ample time to get to know one another and sort out with whom they are compatible. Our primary analyses therefore involved comparing different levels of social distance and the direction of changes in social distance to test whether Time 1 neural similarities predicted (1) friendship at our latest time point (Time 3, eight months later) and (2) increases, rather than decreases, in social closeness over time (that is, in the six months between Times 2 and 3).

More specifically, in each brain region, we tested whether individuals who had a social distance of 1 (that is, friends) eight months into the academic programme had greater neural similarity before meeting one another than individuals characterized by greater social distances (that is, friends-of-friends and friends-of-friends-of-friends). Additionally, for each pair of fMRI participants, we determined the direction of their change in social distance over time (that is, from Time 2 to Time 3) and tested whether (and in which brain region(s)) individuals who grew closer in social ties over time had exhibited greater initial neural similarity before meeting one another than individuals who did not grow closer over time (Methods).

Mean neural similarities for dyads within each of the three social distance levels are visualized in Fig. 3. There were 93 dyads with a social distance of 1 (that is, friends), 544 dyads with a social distance of 2 (that is, friends-of-friends) and 183 dyads with a social distance of 3 (that is, friends-of-friends-of-friends). In this set of analyses, we compared pre-existing neural similarities between friends to those of dyads with different levels of social distance at Time 3. We first tested whether pre-existing neural similarities between individuals who came to be characterized by a social distance of 1 (that is, who became friends) eight months later were greater than pre-existing neural similarities between individuals who did not. Specifically, this first analysis, which compared distance level 1 dyads against distance levels 2 and 3 combined, revealed no significant differences in pre-existing neural similarity between those groups (statistical significance was determined using permutation testing; Methods).

a–c, Social distance, ranging from 1 to 3, is the geodesic distance between a pair of individuals in the social network characterized by reciprocal friendship ties. The data are overlaid on a cortical surface model and are shown in lateral (a), medial (b) and dorsal and ventral (c) views. Because these images merely depict the relative mean similarities for each brain region for each group of dyads, rather than the results of statistical tests, no thresholding has been performed. Inter-participant neural similarities were normalized (that is, z-scored across dyads for each region; see Supplementary Fig. 2 for non-normalized ISCs), averaged within each social distance level and then projected onto an inflated model of the cortical surface. Warmer colours correspond to relatively similar neural responses for a given region, and cooler colours correspond to relatively dissimilar neural responses for a given region.

We followed up on these analyses, in which all non-friends were collapsed into a single category, with analogous analyses comparing pre-existing neural similarities between friends to those between individuals characterized by a social distance of 2 (that is, friends-of-friends) or 3 (that is, friends-of-friends-of-friends). Whereas no significant differences were observed between friends and friends-of-friends, friends exhibited significantly higher pre-existing neural similarity in a portion of the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; Fig. 4) than pairs of individuals characterized by a social distance of 3 (95% bootstrap confidence interval, [0.313, 0.998]; P < 0.001, corrected for false discovery rate (FDR)). A similar pattern of results was observed when we excluded the pairs of individuals who reported having interacted with each other (for example, briefly met at a happy hour) prior to the neuroimaging session (that is, excluding 18 dyads of the total 820 dyads; 95% bootstrap confidence interval, [0.314, 1.010]; Supplementary Fig. 5). For completeness, analogous analyses were conducted using social network data at Time 2 (two months into the academic programme; mean neural similarities for dyads within each of the three social distance levels at Time 2 are visualized in Supplementary Fig. 3), and there were no significant differences in pre-existing neural similarity between friends and any other non-friend groups (Supplementary Fig. 4).

a–c, The data are overlaid on a cortical surface model. Warmer colours correspond to relatively greater neural similarity for future friends than for other pairs of participants, and cooler colours correspond to relatively less neural similarity for future friends than for other pairs of participants. Individuals who became friends with each other showed greater pre-existing neural similarity in a portion of the left OFC (P < 0.001, FDR-corrected; statistical significance was determined using permutation testing) than individuals who ended up three degrees of separation from each other in the social network eight months after Time 1. The overlaid data are unthresholded; regions with significant differences, after FDR correction for multiple tests, are outlined in black.

In exploratory analyses, we investigated whether accounting for inter-individual similarities in ratings of enjoyment of and interest in the stimuli would fully account for and/or significantly diminish the difference in neural similarity between friends and pairs of individuals characterized by a social distance of 3 (Methods). In our first set of such analyses, which tested whether the difference in neural similarity between friends and pairs of individuals with a social distance of 3 could be fully accounted for by inter-individual similarities in ratings of enjoyment and interest in the stimuli, the effect in the OFC remained significant when we controlled for inter-individual similarities in ratings of enjoyment and interest (Supplementary Fig. 6). This suggests that similarity in neural responding in this brain region captured, at least in part, similarities in friends' responses to the stimuli that the interest and enjoyment ratings did not. Even so, while similar patterns of results were observed with and without controlling for similarities in these behavioural ratings, it is possible that the observed neural differences between groups of dyads might have been partly but significantly driven by participants' interest in and/or enjoyment of the stimuli. If this were the case, we would expect the magnitude of the neural similarity difference between groups to significantly decrease when controlling for such behavioural similarities. Thus, to inform our interpretation of the psychological meaning of the OFC result, we tested whether controlling for inter-individual similarities in ratings of either enjoyment or interest would significantly diminish the difference in neural similarity between friends and pairs of individuals characterized by a social distance of 3 (Methods). Neither controlling for inter-individual similarity in interest ratings nor controlling for inter-individual similarity in enjoyment ratings significantly decreased the difference in neural similarity between friends and individuals with a social distance of 3.

For each dyad, we calculated their direction of change in social distance between Time 2 (that is, two months into their academic programme) and Time 3 (that is, eight months into their academic programme). Dyads were divided into three categories based on whether they grew closer over time (that is, decreased in social distance), grew apart over time (that is, increased in social distance) or remained at the same social distance. Mean neural similarities across dyads within each of the three change-in-social-distance categories are visualized in Fig. 5. We tested whether pre-existing neural similarities between individuals who grew closer over time were greater than those between individuals who did not grow closer over time (that is, who grew apart or whose social distance did not change). Statistical significance was determined using permutation testing (Methods). Relative to individuals who did not grow closer over the course of six months, people who grew closer did not exhibit significantly greater pre-existing neural similarity.

Because these images merely depict the relative mean similarities for each brain region for each group of dyads, rather than the results of statistical tests, no thresholding has been performed. Inter-participant neural similarities were normalized (that is, z-scored across dyads for each region; see Supplementary Fig. 7 for non-normalized ISCs), averaged within directions of change in social distance and then projected onto an inflated model of the cortical surface. Warmer colours correspond to relatively similar neural responses for a given region, and cooler colours correspond to relatively dissimilar neural responses for a given region.

We followed up on these analyses, in which all pairs of participants that did not grow closer to each other over time were collapsed into a single category, with analogous analyses comparing pre-existing similarities between pairs of individuals who grew closer over time (that is, between Times 2 and 3) to those between pairs of individuals whose social distance did not change or who grew apart over time. Pairs of individuals who grew closer over time did not exhibit significantly higher pre-existing neural similarity than individuals whose social distance did not change over time. However, relative to individuals who grew apart over time, individuals who grew closer over time exhibited significantly higher pre-existing neural similarity in the bilateral thalamus, the left amygdala and 40 cortical regions spanning the visual cortex, ventral temporal cortex, occipitotemporal cortex, superior parietal cortex, angular gyrus, medial frontal cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex (P < 0.05, FDR-corrected; Fig. 6). A similar pattern of results was observed when we excluded pairs of individuals who reported having interacted with each other in any way prior to the neuroimaging session (Supplementary Fig. 9) and when we controlled for enjoyment and interest ratings (Supplementary Fig. 10). For each brain region that was statistically significant from the abovementioned analyses, the 95% confidence intervals of the normalized differences in intersubject correlations (ISCs) between the dyads that grew apart versus dyads that grew closer, as well as the associated P values, are reported in Supplementary Tables 2–5.

a–c, The data are overlaid on a cortical surface model. Warmer colours correspond to relatively greater mean neural similarity for a given brain region, and cooler colours correspond to relatively less mean neural similarity. For a given dyad, change in social distance over time was calculated by subtracting their social distance at Time 2 from their social distance at Time 3. The dyads were then placed into three categories depending on whether their social distance increased, decreased or remained the same. Pairs of individuals who grew closer to each other over time exhibited greater pre-existing neural similarity in 40 cortical regions spanning portions of the visual cortex, ventral temporal cortex, occipitotemporal cortex, superior parietal cortex, angular gyrus, medial frontal cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex than pairs of individuals who grew apart over time. The overlaid data are unthresholded; regions with significant differences (P < 0.05; statistical significance was determined using permutation testing; the P values for each brain region that showed a significant effect are reported in Supplementary Table 2), after FDR correction for multiple tests, are outlined in black.

To further investigate why individuals who grew closer over time exhibited significantly higher pre-existing neural similarity than individuals who grew apart over time, we tested whether accounting for inter-individual similarities in ratings of enjoyment and interest in the stimuli would significantly diminish the difference in neural similarity between these two groups (Methods). This analysis was repeated for each of the brain regions in which we observed a significant difference in mean neural similarity (that is, the regions outlined in black in Fig. 6). We reasoned that even though similar patterns of results were obtained with and without statistically accounting for inter-participant similarities in enjoyment and interest ratings, it is possible that the observed group differences in ISCs in some brain regions might have been partially (and significantly) driven by what participants found enjoyable or interesting. We thus conducted this analysis with the goal of informing interpretations of the observed results. Controlling for inter-individual similarities in ratings of enjoyment of the stimuli significantly decreased the extent to which individuals who grew closer over time exhibited higher neural similarity in a portion of the right superior parietal cortex (difference in mean normalized neural similarity, 0.015; P = 0.036) than individuals who grew apart over time. However, this effect was not observed in other brain regions when we controlled for inter-individual similarities in ratings of interest in the stimuli.

Given that homophily based on sociodemographic variables is widely observed in social networks, we ran analyses to test whether the relationships observed between pre-existing neural similarity and social network phenomena were accounted for by inter-participant similarities in sociodemographic variables (including inter-individual similarities in their age, gender, nationality, hometown size and location, undergraduate alma mater location and institution type, undergraduate major, and industry). When we controlled for these demographic variables, the significant effect in the left portion of the OFC shown in our first set of analyses, comparing pre-existing neural similarity between friends and dyads of a social distance of 3, was no longer significant after FDR correction across 214 brain regions (95% bootstrap confidence interval, [0.162, 0.909]; P = 0.003; FDR-corrected P = 0.589); however, we observed similar patterns of results with and without controlling for these demographic variables in the second set of analyses comparing the neural similarity of dyads that grew closer versus apart (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 3). To further probe whether accounting for this extensive set of sociodemographic variables significantly reduced the difference in neural similarity between future friends and future friends-of-friends-of-friends, and if so, what sociodemographic variable(s) drove the significant reduction, we conducted analyses analogous to those that we performed to test whether accounting for inter-individual similarities in the extent to which participants found the stimuli enjoyable or interesting significantly diminished links between the neural and social network data. We found that controlling for these demographic variables resulted in a significant reduction of the neural similarity differences between friends and dyads of a social distance of 3 in the aforementioned OFC parcel (difference in mean normalized neural similarity, 0.129; P = 0.042), and that only gender similarity resulted in a significant reduction in the difference in neural similarity between groups (difference in mean normalized neural similarity, 0.019; P = 0.043).

Do pre-existing neural similarities predict future friendship? The current results provide evidence for neural homophily, such that relative to people who ended up far from one another in social ties, people who ended up becoming friends with one another demonstrated greater pre-existing neural similarity before meeting one another. Additionally, pre-existing neural similarity was particularly strongly linked to changes in inter-individual social distance between two and eight months after entering a new community. Such changes reflected the formation, persistence and dissolution of friendships in the community's social network.

Relative to individuals who had a social distance of 3 after having lived in a new community for eight months, individuals who became friends exhibited greater pre-existing neural similarity in a portion of the left OFC. Given the role of the OFC in processing subjective value24, neural similarity in this brain region may reflect similarities in tastes and preferences (for example, similarities in what individuals find funny or otherwise appealing), which may become aligned across certain individuals as a function of sociodemographic similarities. Inter-individual similarity in sociodemographic variables (that is, age, gender, nationality, hometown size and location, undergraduate alma mater, undergraduate major, and industry) appeared to drive the differences in pre-existing neural similarity in the OFC that were observed between friends and friends-of-friends-of-friends. In particular, accounting for gender similarity significantly reduced differences in pre-existing neural similarity between friends and distance 3 dyads in this brain region. However, controlling for inter-individual similarity in the extent to which individuals were interested in the stimuli did not significantly diminish the difference in pre-existing neural similarity between friends and individuals characterized by a social distance of 3. Although neural similarity in this brain region may reflect similarity in the processing of subjective value, inter-individual similarity in self-reported ratings of preferences may not completely account for the subjective value processing that may be particularly aligned among friends.

We observed a similar pattern of results when examining the relationship between pre-existing neural similarities and changes in inter-individual social distance over the course of six months. Relative to dyads who drifted apart over time, dyads who grew closer in social ties over time were characterized by exceptionally similar neural responses in portions of the bilateral OFC, and this difference in neural similarity was not significantly diminished when we controlled for similarities in individuals' self-reported enjoyment of or interest in the stimuli. Furthermore, dyads who grew closer in social ties over time also exhibited exceptionally similar neural responses in many brain regions spanning the default mode network (DMN), the frontoparietal control network (FPCN) and the dorsal attention network, suggesting that pre-existing neural similarities were particularly predictive of whether friendships formed, persisted or dissolved over time.

In particular, this relationship was observed in canonical DMN regions25, such as the angular gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex, which have a well-established role in social cognitive functions such as mentalizing and perspective-taking26,27,28. Similarities in neural responding in these DMN regions have been associated with convergent interpretations of and affective responses to complex narratives29,30,31,32,33,34. Similar responding in these regions among people who later became friends may thus reflect pre-existing similarities in how such individuals deployed socio-cognitive processing to interpret the stimuli. Indeed, a recent framework has suggested that the DMN serves as an active “sense-making” network that integrates prior beliefs and long-term memories (for example, intrinsic information) with processing of extrinsic information to create models of real-life situations as they unfold in real time35. However, this relationship was not observed in all DMN regions (for example, the temporal poles and precuneus) but was observed in portions of the ventral temporal cortex and occipitotemporal cortex. Together with the angular gyrus, these regions, in part, have been suggested to comprise “gestalt cortex”, in which inter-individual similarity in seemingly effortless subjective construal of complex narratives is associated with neural similarity36. Neural similarities in these regions may thus capture the creation of high-level meaning across individuals as they watch naturalistic stimuli.

People who grew closer over time also exhibited greater pre-existing neural similarities in several regions of the FPCN, such as the lateral prefrontal cortex, the cingulate cortex and a portion of the inferior temporal gyrus. Recent work has shown that a subsystem of the FPCN couples with the DMN across a multitude of tasks, such as those involving mentalizing, emotional processing, metacognitive awareness, prospective memory, stimulus-independent and abstract thinking, and future planning37. Given the well-established role of the FPCN in executive control38, the FPCN may support top-down management of thought by constraining one's focus on contextually relevant material while simultaneously allowing for introspective thought37,39, such as the processing of personally salient information or internally focused autobiographical planning40,41. In the context of watching naturalistic stimuli, the integration of internal trains of thought (for example, prior beliefs and memories) and processing of extrinsic stimuli is crucial for understanding complex narratives35, suggesting that the FPCN may work in concert with the DMN to engage in sense-making of complex narratives. This is in line with prior work demonstrating that similarity in neural responding in both the DMN and FPCN is associated with similarity in subjective understanding of a complex narrative30. Such similarities in subjective construal of narratives may be particularly conducive to friendship formation, as they may reflect, more generally, alignment in how individuals make sense of the world around them.

We also observed pre-existing neural similarities in the superior parietal lobule and occipitotemporal cortex between friends that were significantly greater than those of people more distant from each other in their social network. Given that both of these regions are associated with the dorsal attention network42,43, these neural similarities may reflect similarities in attentional allocation and in level of engagement. A growing body of research has demonstrated that attention modulates DMN activity during the processing of complex narratives35,44,45. In the context of viewing naturalistic stimuli, pre-existing neural similarities in the dorsal attention network may reflect inter-individual similarities in how people allocate their attention and what people find particularly engaging, which may lead to convergent interpretations of complex stimuli.

Controlling for inter-individual similarities in ratings of enjoyment of and interest in the stimuli did not significantly diminish the exceptionally large difference in pre-existing neural similarity between individuals who grew closer over time and those who drifted apart. This was observed in nearly every brain region (besides the right superior parietal cortex, where accounting for enjoyment ratings decreased the difference in neural similarity between pairs of people who grew closer and those who drifted apart) in which individuals who grew closer over time exhibited exceptionally higher pre-existing neural similarity. This suggests that pre-existing neural similarities that predict whether people grow closer or drift apart go beyond what is captured by self-reported ratings of interest and enjoyment. A more extensive set of brain regions was implicated in our second set of analyses (which focused on changes in social distance over time) than in our first set of analyses (which compared friends to other dyads within the fMRI sample). This may be due in part to the fact that the second set of analyses are sensitive to changes in dyadic social distance over time that are driven by the formation or dissolution of friendships beyond the dyad, including those where one or both people involved in a friendship did not complete the fMRI study, whereas the first set of analyses may not be as sensitive to such phenomena. It is possible that future studies in which a larger proportion of the social network undergoes neuroimaging would reveal associations between friendship formation and neural similarity in a more extensive set of brain regions.

The current results suggest that individuals who process audiovisual movies in a similar fashion are exceptionally likely to become friends in the future and grow closer in social ties over time. Viewing naturalistic stimuli demands continuous integration of dynamic information streams as they unfold in real time, thereby evoking a wide range of socio-cognitive and emotional processes that characterize everyday mental life46,47,48. Thus, similarities in how people think about and respond to naturalistic stimuli may reflect more general similarities in how people think about and respond to the world around them. Taken together with the current results, this growing body of research is consistent with the possibility that these inter-individual similarities may facilitate social connection and the formation of social ties. Indeed, separate work has shown that a sense of “generalized shared reality” (that is, similarities in feelings, beliefs and concerns about the world in general) is linked to social connection and interpersonal liking19 and thus may be conducive to friendship formation. The pre-existing neural similarities observed in the current study may also underpin similarities in sociobehavioural tendencies, which can lead individuals to participate in similar activities and frequent similar social spaces. Such sociobehavioural similarities can also foster the formation of affiliative ties by facilitating interpersonal communication and predictability49,50,51,52.

Variability in these pre-existing similarities may have also facilitated the formation, persistence and dissolution of direct social ties between the two-month mark and the eight-month mark after individuals entered their new community. It is possible that some initial friendships at the two-month mark were formed based more on opportunity (for example, befriending others who conveniently sit nearby in class) than on deep interpersonal compatibility (for example, a sense of generalized shared reality)19. Subsequently, between the two-month mark and the eight-month mark, neural and social homophily processes may have had more time to unfold. As a result, given sufficient time, pairs of individuals may have formed and/or maintained friendships due to interpersonal compatibilities reflected in pre-existing neural and social similarity. In contrast, friendships born out of mere circumstance may have dissolved due to interpersonal incompatibilities, reflected in pre-existing neural and social dissimilarities, which became apparent only with the extended passage of time.

The current results are consistent with the possibility of neural homophily, such that future friends share pre-existing neural similarity before meeting one another. Future work would benefit from investigating the role of social influence, as it is likely that homophily and social influence processes interact in human social networks. For example, pre-existing similarities in how individuals think about and respond to the world around them may, in part, cause individuals to become friends. Over time, these individuals may undergo repeated, sustained social interactions that lead to further convergence in how they tend to speak, think, feel and behave53,54,55, which may increase similarity in neural processing. This effect of social influence can percolate outward to more distal social ties, which allows for even indirectly connected individuals to influence and be influenced by each other56. Although the current study attempted to test for both neural homophily and social influence, planned collection of fMRI data two years after the participants entered their new community was prevented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Future work can leverage longitudinal fMRI to further examine such phenomena.

We also note that in the current study, fMRI data had to be collected within a very short time frame (that is, as soon as participants arrived on campus; as described in the Methods, the modal number of days between participants' arrival on campus and their participation in the fMRI study was 1, and the median number of days was 3) to minimize participants' opportunities to begin interacting with and befriending one another beforehand. This constraint, particularly in combination with other logistical limitations (for example, instrument availability during participants' initial arrival period), imposed a limit on sample size. Future studies would benefit from examining the current phenomena in larger samples.

Although the current sample included participants from a wide range of nationalities (Methods), the current results are reflective of a single context, and results may vary across cultures and contexts. Past cross-sectional work has linked neural23 and behavioural8 similarities to social network proximity across markedly different sociocultural contexts. However, it is important to note that the current evidence for neural homophily is constrained within a community of graduate students studying business at a private university in a single cultural context. Furthermore, participants self-selected to participate in the fMRI study, and it is possible that systematic differences exist between people who do or do not elect to participate in such a study. Future work examining these effects across diverse cultures and communities, ideally randomly sampling participants from within communities, will yield a more comprehensive understanding of how this phenomenon may differentially unfold across different social networks.

Relatedly, although we attempted to statistically account for inter-participant similarities in some sociodemographic variables in our analyses, it is likely that some unmeasured sociodemographic variables (particularly those related to similar cultural perspectives) causally contribute to both pre-existing neural similarities between participants and subsequent friendship formation. Our results are consistent with a causal model in which a wide array of sociodemographic variables and other factors, including but not limited to those that we were able to measure here (such as geographic proximity, race, nationality, gender, birth cohort, religion, linguistic background, educational background, parenting, political beliefs, genes, gene–environment interactions and so on), give rise to sets of experiences, expectations and social feedback that in turn give rise to particular ways of responding to the world, which are reflected in neural activity and, when similar, facilitate future friendship.

The current results nevertheless demonstrate that even without knowing or measuring all of these possibly innumerable sociodemographic variables and other factors, it is possible to measure one of their likely outcomes (neural similarity), which predicts future friendship. Although the question of the precise causes of such neural similarity may be intractable (given that there are probably numerous interactive causes, whose relative importance may vary across contexts), the current findings suggest that neural similarity predicts both future friendship formation and growing closer to particular people over time. We hope that future research can build on the current work to elucidate what factors contribute to similar ways of processing the world. Although we do not expect any single study to be able to fully address this question, it will be valuable for the field in general to better understand how sociocultural (and other) forces shape neural activity.

More broadly, despite the substantial degree of random assignment to which participants were subjected regarding with whom and where they lived, and regarding with whom they studied and took classes (Methods), we note that this study is inherently limited in its capacity to support decisive causal claims, given that it was an observational study. Thus, while the current findings are consistent with the causal model posited above, in which innumerable demographic and biological factors give rise to shared ways of responding to the world that are reflected in neural similarities and that in turn facilitate friendship, more research is needed to better understand how relationships among these phenomena come to be, to investigate potential moderating factors and to more directly test for such a causal model.

We also note that the current study's stimuli were selected and presented in a manner that we hypothesized would afford sensitivity to detect our predicted effects, as described in the Methods. It remains to be seen what kinds of stimuli and what characteristics of stimuli would evoke ISCs that would be most closely linked to future friendship formation. Similarly, it remains to be seen whether similar results would be observed if inter-participant neural similarities were instead computed on the basis of patterns of functional connectivity measured at rest or during naturalistic stimulation (which has recently been shown to be more predictive of behaviour than rest57). It would be valuable for future work to systematically address these questions, as such work has the potential to inform both basic and applied research on predictors of social connection.

A growing body of cross-sectional research integrating neuroimaging and social network analysis has demonstrated that individuals closer together in their real-world social network tend to share similarities in neuroanatomy22, resting-state functional connectomes23 and neural responses to watching naturalistic stimuli20,21. However, the cross-sectional nature of this work has limited the types of inferences that can be made about the causal relationship between neural similarity and social distance. The current research expands on this work and sheds light on the potential role of neural homophily in shaping human social structures over time.

All data collection procedures were completed in accordance with the standards of the local ethical review board at Dartmouth College. A subset of 43 individuals from an incoming graduate student (MBA) cohort (Ncohort = 288) at a private university in the USA participated in the neuroimaging study. The participants were scanned as soon as possible after their arrival on campus and self-selected to participate in the study after receiving a recruitment email that was sent to all incoming students in the cohort. The majority of fMRI participants were scanned shortly after arriving on campus (Supplementary Fig. 1). The modal number of days between participants' arrival on campus and their participation in the fMRI study was 1, and the median number of days was 3. Two of the fMRI participants were scanned more than one month after their arrival on campus; these participants had been enrolled in two different prior graduate programmes at the university but had not met one another at the time of the fMRI scan. The participants provided informed consent in accordance with the policies of the institution's ethical review board at Dartmouth College. Of the 43 participants, one participant did not complete the scan and was excluded from analysis, and one participant did not participate in the social network survey administered at Time 3 (see ‘Social network survey participants') and thus was excluded from analysis. Data from the resulting 41 participants (14 female) aged 25–34 (mean, 28.63; s.d., 2.15) were used for analysis. Of these participants, two participants had excess movement in only one of the four fMRI runs; thus, these scans were excluded from the analyses involving these two participants. Of these 41 participants, 38 were right-handed, and 3 were left-handed. Twenty-four participants self-identified their nationality as that of the USA; the remainder included five participants from India, two from Australia, two from Peru and one each from Argentina, Iran, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, the United Kingdom, China, Brazil and Canada. Fifteen participants identified as White/Non-Hispanic, two identified as Hispanic/Latino, one identified as Black/Non-Hispanic, one identified as Asian/Asian-American/Pacific-Islander, one identified as multi-racial and 21 chose to not indicate their ethnicity. The neuroimaging study was advertised to all students in the cohort via email. All students who were interested in participating and who passed a standard MRI safety screening participated in the scan. The participants received US$20 per hour for their participation.

Approximately two months (Time 2) and eight months (Time 3) after the fMRI scan (Time 1), the social network of the academic cohort was characterized (Fig. 1). Participants were from the same cohort of 288 (aged 24–39; mean age, 28.53; 129 females) first-year graduate students who had been recruited for the fMRI study at Time 1. As part of the graduate programme's aim to help students build a professional network, students were randomly assigned to study groups using stratified random sampling, such that students completed all of their coursework with the same group of randomly assigned classmates in each term. Additionally, nearly all students applied to on-campus housing and were randomly assigned to housing units on the basis of a lottery system. (That said, we note that even if housing units and roommates were initially randomly assigned, it is possible that they did not stay that way, given past research demonstrating both individual- and dyad-level predictors of roommate satisfaction and breakup, including various facets of interpersonal similarity58,59.) All students in the first-year graduate cohort enrolled in a leadership course within the graduate programme, and they were invited to participate in the online social network survey as an optional part of their coursework on leadership. To encourage participation, students who completed the survey were provided with personalized, educational feedback about their social networks based on their survey responses, but they were reminded that participation was voluntary and would not affect their performance in the course (see more details about recruitment and data collection on p. 24 of the Supplementary Information). At Time 2, all students in the cohort completed an online social network survey (that is, 100% response rate). At Time 3, all students except one individual completed the survey (that is, 99.6% response rate).

The participants were scanned using a Siemens Prisma 3T scanner. Six functional runs were acquired using an echo-planar sequence (25 ms echo time; 2,000 ms repetition time; 3.0 mm × 3.0 mm × 3.0 mm resolution; 240 mm field of view; 40 interleaved transverse slices with no gap). A high-resolution T1-weighted (T1w) anatomical scan was also acquired for each participant (2.32 ms echo time; 2,300 ms repetition time; 240 mm field of view; 0.9 mm × 0.9 mm × 0.9 mm resolution).

Before the fMRI study began, the participants were told that they would be watching a set of videos while being scanned, which would vary in content, and that their experience in the study would be akin to watching television while someone else channel surfed. All participants saw the same clips in the same order (as if the clips comprised different scenes of a continuous movie), to avoid inducing response variability between participants related to differences in how the clips were presented. The stimuli consisted of 14 videos presented with sound over the course of six fMRI runs. The videos ranged in duration from 88 to 305 s (see Supplementary Table 1 for brief descriptions of the stimuli). The criteria used to select the stimuli are described in more detail in a previous manuscript that used the same stimuli in a different sample20. Briefly, efforts were made to select stimuli that (1) most participants would not have seen before, (2) would be engaging for participants and (3) would evoke diverging inferences and patterns of attentional allocation across viewers, and thus psychologically meaningful variability in neural responding (for example, because different people might attend to, emotionally react to and/or interpret them differently). We selected stimuli that spanned a wide range of styles and topics with the hope of evoking a wide range of cognitive and affective processing that resembles the diverse range of stimulation and associated mental phenomena that arises in everyday life. After the fMRI session, the participants filled out an online survey and provided ratings of the extent to which they enjoyed and were interested in each of the stimuli shown during the fMRI session. For each stimulus, a screenshot was shown, and the participants answered “How interesting did you find this video?” and “How much did you enjoy this video?” on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.

The participants followed an emailed link to the study website, where they responded to a survey designed to assess their position in the social network of students in their cohort of the academic programme. The survey question was adapted from Burt60 and has been previously used in the modified form used here11,20,60,61. It read, “Consider the people with whom you like to spend your free time. Since you arrived at [institution name], who are the classmates you have been with most often for informal social activities, such as going out to lunch, dinner, drinks, films, visiting one another's homes, and so on?” A roster-based name generator was used to avoid inadequate or biased recall. Participants indicated the presence of a social tie with an individual by placing a checkmark next to his or her name. Participants could indicate any number of social ties and had no time limit for responding to this question.

We note that in this particular graduate programme, students lived close to each other in an isolated, rural area. Furthermore, they took classes together and frequently ate meals and socialized together. These characteristics of this graduate programme engendered an intense and immersive social experience.

fMRIPrep version 1.4.0 was used for anatomical and functional data preprocessing62. The T1w image was corrected for intensity non-uniformity with N4BiasFieldCorrection, distributed with ANTs version 2.1.0 and used as the T1w reference throughout the workflow. The T1w reference was then skull-stripped with a Nipype implementation of the antsBrainExtraction.sh workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANT as the target template. Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid, white matter and grey matter was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using FSL FAST. Volume-based spatial normalization to MNI152Nlin2009cAsym standard space was performed through nonlinear registration with antsRegistration (ANTs version 2.1.0), using brain-extracted versions of both the T1w reference and the T1w template.

For each of the six blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) runs per participant (across all tasks and sessions), the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using FSL FLIRT with the boundary-based registration cost-function. Co-registration was configured with nine degrees of freedom to account for distortions remaining in the BOLD reference. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) were estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using FSL MCFLIRT. Automatic removal of motion artefacts using independent component analysis (ICA-AROMA) was performed on the preprocessed BOLD run on MNI space time-series after the removal of non-steady-state volumes and spatial smoothing with an isotropic, Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full-width half-maximum. The confounding variables generated by fMRIPrep that were used as nuisance variables in the current study included global signals extracted from the cerebrospinal fluid, white matter and whole-brain masks; framewise displacement; three translational motion parameters; and three rotational motion parameters. These confounds were regressed out of the data for each preprocessed run. Temporal filtering was performed with a band-pass filter between 0.009 and 0.08 Hz.

The Schaefer et al.42 parcellation scheme (resampled to MNI152Nlin2009cAsym standard space) with 200 parcels was used in the current study to define the 200 cortical regions of interest. Each parcel is associated with one of seven brain networks from the Yeo et al.43 seven-network parcellation—the visual, somatomotor, dorsal attention, ventral attention, limbic, frontoparietal task control and default mode networks. The Harvard-Oxford subcortical atlas63 was used to define 14 subcortical regions of interest—the bilateral nucleus accumbens, amygdala, putamen, caudate, thalamus, hippocampus and pallidum.

The following steps were taken to characterize the social networks at Time 2 and at Time 3. Social network data were analysed using igraph (version 1.5.1)64 in R (version 4.3.1)65. An unweighted graph consisting of only mutually reported social ties was used to estimate social distances between individuals. In other words, an undirected edge would connect two actors only if they had both nominated one another as friends, and no edge would connect the two actors if neither nominated the other as a friend or if only one actor nominated the other as their friend. Social distance was defined as the geodesic distance between people in the social network—that is, as the smallest number of intermediary social ties required to connect them in the network. Pairs of individuals who both named one another as friends were assigned a social distance of 1. Individuals were assigned a distance of 2 from one another if they had a mutually reported friendship with a shared friend but were not friends with one another, and so on.

At Time 2, of the 820 dyads of fMRI participants, 63 (7.68%) had a social distance of 1 (that is, they were friends), 436 (53.17%) had a social distance of 2 (that is, they were friends of one another's friends), 280 (34.15%) had a social distance of 3 and 41 (5.00%) had a social distance of 4. Dyads with a social distance of 4 were recoded as dyads with a social distance of 3 for the first set of analyses, given that similarities in neural responses in people four or more degrees of separation apart have previously been found to be highly variable and not significantly different from those of dyads two or three degrees of separation apart20,although this recoding did not impact results. More generally, a large body of research demonstrates that relationships between interpersonal similarities in a variety of cognitive, emotional and behavioural phenomena (for example, risk perception, cooperation, smoking, depression, loneliness and happiness) and social network proximity disappear beyond three to four degrees of separation66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73. At Time 3, of the 820 dyads of fMRI participants, 93 (11.34%) had a social distance of 1, 544 (66.34%) had a social distance of 2 and 183 (22.32%) had a social distance of 3. For each social network, for descriptive purposes, we then calculated the average number of social ties across individuals, the median number of social ties and the reciprocity of the graph, which refers to the probability that person i nominated person j as a friend if person j nominated person i as a friend (mean social ties at Time 2, 72; median social ties at Time 2, 65; reciprocity at Time 2, 0.53; mean social ties at Time 3, 100; median social ties at Time 3, 91; reciprocity at Time 3, 0.56). Here, the number of social ties refers to degree centrality, where incoming and outgoing ties are summed.

The following analysis was performed in each of the 200 cortical and 14 subcortical brain regions, and all analyses were conducted in Python (version 3.9.6). For each fMRI participant, all six fMRI scans were concatenated into a single time series (except for two participants who had only three scans that were concatenated due to excess movement in the excluded scans). For each fMRI participant, the neural response time series was spatially averaged across all voxels within a given region. For each unique pair of fMRI participants, we then calculated the Pearson correlation between their neural response time series, yielding a value reflecting neural similarity for a given region. For each region, disproportionately high and low neural similarity values (that is, outliers) were identified for values 1.5 times the interquartile range above the upper quartile (75th percentile) or below the lower quartile (25th percentile), and these outliers were reassigned values equal to the upper quartile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range or the lower quartile minus 1.5 times the interquartile range, respectively. For a given region, these neural similarity values were then Fisher-z-transformed and normalized across fMRI dyads using scikit-learn's StandardScaler function74.

To test whether individuals characterized by a social distance of 1 (that is, friends) initially exhibited significantly higher neural similarity in a given brain region than did individuals characterized by a social distance of 2 or 3 (that is, non-friends), we first bucketed all individuals characterized by a social distance of 2 or 3 into a single category of social distance (that is, non-friends). The mean neural similarity was then calculated for each of the two resulting levels of social distance (that is, friends and non-friends). We then subtracted the mean neural similarity between pairs of individuals who did not become friends from the mean neural similarity between pairs of individuals who did become friends. To assess the statistical significance of this difference, we implemented the following permutation testing procedure. Neuroimaging data were randomly shuffled across fMRI participants, at the individual level, 1,000 times while holding all else in the dataset constant. Specifically, prior to calculating neural similarities, participant labels for the fMRI dataset were randomly shuffled (that is, each set of fMRI data was permuted at the individual level) to ensure that the permuted datasets would have equivalent dependency structures to the observed (non-permuted) data. In addition, we note that node-level permutations are often used for hypothesis testing on social network data across a wide range of contexts, particularly when probing potential links between individual nodes' features (here, neural responses) and their patterns of interactions or associations with one another, given that this method generates null models that break potential links between these variables while preserving the structure of the network75. In each permuted dataset, the inter-participant neural similarities for all parcels were computed for each dyad, and the mean neural similarity between individuals characterized by a social distance of 2 or 3 was again subtracted from the mean neural similarity between individuals characterized by a social distance of 1. This procedure yielded a null distribution of 1,000 permuted difference values. We then calculated the extent to which the true difference value was greater than the null distribution to generate a P value. These P values were then corrected for FDR across all 214 regions.

To get the 95% bootstrap confidence intervals, we generated 1,000 bootstrap samples of the fMRI participants at each time point. Then, for each unique dyad from the unique nodes in a given bootstrap sample, we retrieved the normalized ISCs of each brain region. Subsequently, we calculated the mean difference in ISCs between comparison groups (for example, dyads of social distance 1 versus 3) for each bootstrap sample. The 95% confidence intervals for each brain region were obtained by taking the 2.5% and 97.5% cut-offs of the bootstrap sampling distribution of mean differences in ISCs.

We repeated these analyses while controlling for inter-participant similarities in the sociodemographic variables of age, gender, nationality, hometown (in terms of both its location and its population), undergraduate alma mater (in terms of both whether they attended a private or public institution and the institution's location), undergraduate major, and the industry in which they had been employed before enrolling in the MBA programme. More specifically, to statistically account for demographic similarities that may be related to similarities in neural responding and/or social network proximity, we regressed out inter-participant similarities in the aforementioned sociodemographic variables from ISCs in each brain region before repeating the analyses described above.

This analytical procedure was repeated to test whether individuals characterized by a social distance of 1 exhibited significantly higher neural similarity in a given region than did individuals characterized by a social distance of 2. It was also repeated to test whether individuals characterized by a social distance of 1 exhibited significantly higher neural similarity in a given region than did individuals characterized by a social distance of 3.

In each brain region in which a significant difference in neural similarity between groups was observed, we then tested whether inter-individual similarity in self-reported ratings of enjoyment of the stimuli accounted for a significant portion of this difference. Even when similar patterns of results are observed with and without controlling for similarities in behavioural ratings, it is possible that the magnitude of the neural similarity difference between groups would significantly decrease when controlling for such behavioural similarities if the neural similarities are partially driven by them. These exploratory analyses thus aim to inform the psychological interpretation of the significant findings. First, for a given dyad, inter-individual similarity in enjoyment or interest ratings was measured by calculating the Euclidean distance between individuals' vectorized series of enjoyment ratings across the stimuli to yield a single similarity value. We then calculated the between-group difference in mean normalized neural similarity, and we separately calculated the between-group difference in mean normalized neural similarity after controlling for inter-individual similarities in enjoyment ratings. We then subtracted the latter difference value from the former difference value to yield a value capturing the extent to which between-group difference in neural similarity was diminished when controlling for inter-individual enjoyment similarity. To test whether this decrease in between-group difference in neural similarity was statistically significant, we implemented the following permutation testing procedure. Enjoyment ratings were randomly shuffled across fMRI participants 1,000 times while holding all else in the dataset constant. In each permuted dataset, the above-mentioned analytic procedure was repeated to generate a value capturing the decrease in between-group difference in neural similarity when controlling for enjoyment similarity. This procedure yielded a null distribution of 1,000 values capturing the decrease in between-group difference in neural similarity when controlling for enjoyment similarity. We then calculated the extent to which the true value was greater than this null distribution to generate a P value.

This analytical procedure was repeated using self-reported ratings of interest in the stimuli to test whether inter-individual similarity in self-reported ratings of interest in the stimuli accounted for significant portions of the differences in neural similarity between groups. This analytical procedure was also repeated using demographic variables to probe whether inter-individual similarity in demographic variables significantly accounted for the differences in pre-existing neural similarity between groups.

For each pair of fMRI participants, the change in social distance between Time 2 and Time 3 was calculated by subtracting their Time 2 social distance from their Time 3 social distance. Given that (1) extensive changes in social distance from Time 2 to Time 3 were possible for only a small number of dyads (for example, only 5% of dyads were far enough apart in the social network at Time 2 to be able to decrease in social distance by three degrees of separation by Time 3) and (2) extraneous and situational factors may have an especially large impact on these early social distance values (as mentioned in the Discussion), we focused on the overall direction of social distance change (for example, whether participants within a given dyad decreased in social distance over time) rather than more granular variability in social distance changes.

To test whether individuals whose social distance decreased (that is, individuals who grew closer over time) between Times 2 and 3 exhibited greater pre-existing neural similarity in a given brain region than did individuals with no change in social distance between Times 2 and 3 or an increase in social distance (that is, individuals who grew apart over time) between Times 2 and 3, we first bucketed all individuals with no change or an increase in social distance into a single category of individuals who did not grow closer over time. In total, of the 820 dyads of fMRI participants, 279 were characterized by a decrease in social distance, 445 were characterized by no change in social distance and 96 were characterized by an increase in social distance. The following analysis was performed in each of the 200 cortical and 14 subcortical brain regions. The mean neural similarity was calculated for individuals who grew closer over time and separately for individuals who did not grow closer over time. We then subtracted the mean neural similarity between individuals who did not grow closer over time from the mean neural similarity between individuals who did grow closer over time. To assess the statistical significance of this difference, we implemented the following permutation testing procedure. Neuroimaging data were randomly shuffled across fMRI participants, at the individual level, 1,000 times while holding all else in the dataset constant. Specifically, prior to calculating neural similarities, participant labels for the fMRI dataset were randomly shuffled (that is, each set of fMRI data was permuted at the individual level) to ensure that the permuted datasets would have equivalent dependency structures to the observed (non-permuted) data. In each permuted dataset, the inter-participant neural similarities for all parcels were computed for each dyad, and the mean neural similarity between individuals who did not grow closer over time was again subtracted from the mean neural similarity between individuals who did grow closer over time. This procedure yielded a null distribution of 1,000 permuted difference values. We then calculated the extent to which the true difference value was greater than the null distribution to generate a P value. These P values were then corrected for FDR across all 214 regions. To get the 95% bootstrap confidence intervals, we generated 1,000 bootstrap samples of the fMRI participants at each time point. Then, for each unique dyad from the unique nodes in a given bootstrap sample, we retrieved the normalized ISCs of each brain region. Subsequently, we calculated the mean difference in ISCs between comparison groups (for example, dyads who grew closer over time versus those that did not) for each bootstrap sample. The 95% confidence intervals for each brain region were obtained by taking the 2.5% and 97.5% cut-offs of the bootstrap sampling distribution of mean differences in ISCs.

We repeated these analyses while controlling for inter-participant similarities in the demographic variables of age, gender, nationality, hometown (in terms of both its location and its population), undergraduate alma mater (in terms of both whether they attended a private or public institution and the institution's location), undergraduate major and the industry in which they had been employed before enrolling in the MBA programme. More specifically, to statistically account for sociodemographic similarities that may be related to similarities in neural responding and/or social network proximity, we regressed out inter-participant similarities in the aforementioned variables from ISCs in each brain region before repeating the analyses described above.

This analytical procedure was repeated to test whether individuals who grew closer over time exhibited greater pre-existing neural similarity in a given region than did individuals whose social distance did not change over time or who grew apart over time.

In each brain region in which a significant difference in neural similarity between groups was observed, we then tested whether inter-individual similarity in self-reported ratings of enjoyment of or interest in the stimuli accounted for this significant difference using the same data-analytic and permutation-testing approaches described in the preceding section (‘Variation in neural similarity by future social distance').

Close to 110,000 heat-related deaths are estimated to have occurred in Europe during the summers of 2022 and 2023 combined1. That's roughly the same number of people as if a fully occupied jumbo jet crashed every day for 16 weeks. Meanwhile, a vast array of heat-related impacts disrupt people's lives. Hot weather worsens mental-health problems2, increases the likelihood of violence3 and makes pregnant women more likely to give birth prematurely4. In classrooms, it impairs children's ability to learn5.

Shade is an essential solution for hotter cities

Shade is an essential solution for hotter cities

The problems are expected to get much worse. Without better adaptation, heat-related deaths are projected to rise 3.7-fold by mid-century if global temperatures reach 2 °C above pre-industrial levels6. (In 2024, the average global temperature exceeded 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels for the first time.) And heat stress in the workplace is expected to cost the global economy US$2.4 trillion each year in lost productivity by 2030.

Currently, most approaches that alert the public to heat-health risk worldwide use ambient (air) temperature thresholds to trigger warnings — usually broad recommendations to reduce activity, stay hydrated and so on. These thresholds are generally based on overall statistical correlations between ambient temperatures and regional increases in death and disease7. But heat stress is defined by more than just temperature, and can affect multiple physiological systems, including the heart and kidneys4. The risk to individuals varies enormously, and depends on factors such as their age, the health of their kidneys and heart, what they are wearing and their level of activity.

Two of us (O.J. and F.T.) are piloting the integration of physiological models and weather data to estimate people's ‘heat-health risk'. We think that heat adaptation could be vastly enhanced by using a physiology-based approach that focuses on hot people, rather than just on hot weather.

Most people can safely tolerate core body temperatures of up to about 39 °C. If body temperature exceeds this value, the risk of heat exhaustion increases, with symptoms including nausea, dizziness and vomiting. At core temperatures above 40 °C, heat stroke can occur. Here, an increase in gut permeability, caused by reduced delivery of oxygen by the blood, allows toxic molecules associated with certain bacteria to leak into the bloodstream. This can trigger an inflammatory response that cascades to cause blood clotting, multiple organ failure and, ultimately, death4.

Whether and how much any one person is harmed by hot weather depends on a mix of environmental factors and characteristics specific to that individual. Besides air temperature, three features of the thermal environment are important: radiation, humidity and wind speed8. Someone in direct sunlight can be exposed to mean radiant temperatures that are more than 20 °C greater than shade temperatures. (Air temperatures used to trigger health warnings are measured in the shade.) High humidity and low wind speed impair the effectiveness of sweating, which is a person's only effective physiological cooling mechanism at air temperatures above 35 °C. The ability to lose heat through the evaporation of sweat is also affected by the thermal and evaporative properties of clothing8, age, body size and some medications9. Even light activity such as walking more than doubles internal heat production, and so increases a person's risk of experiencing health problems in hot weather.

The body's thermoregulation is underpinned by a vast redistribution of blood to the skin. And in hot weather, the need to lose heat increases, meaning that to maintain blood pressure, the heart must pump more often and with greater force. People with heart disease are less able to compensate for the increased strain, and so face higher cardiovascular risk4. The redistribution of blood can also damage organs such as the kidneys by reducing how much oxygen is delivered to them. A depleted blood volume from dehydration in hot weather forces the heart to work harder still, and repeated dehydration can contribute to kidney fibrosis (the accumulation of scar tissue in the kidney) and chronic kidney disease4. People with kidney disease face a higher risk of renal failure in extreme heat.

When air temperatures are expected to exceed a certain threshold, warnings are triggered that help to prepare health and energy systems for bouts of extreme heat1. But the health-related warnings are limited by the quality of available data on heat-related deaths and disease10, and they don't enable precise tailoring of protective measures for groups that are at higher risk.

Why we still don't know the mounting health risks of climate change

Why we still don't know the mounting health risks of climate change

The narrow focus on air temperature also strengthens an entrenched belief that reducing ambient temperatures is the only way to lessen the impacts of heat on health11. But attempts to do this can be unsustainable or ineffective. Coating hot surfaces such as roads with reflective paint, for example, will probably have little impact on physiological heat strain or even on perceived discomfort unless people are lying on the ground, and might even intensify heat loads on people. The benefit of increasing green areas and tree cover in cities is similarly often evaluated according to how much it can reduce the temperature of pavements or the mean air temperature, even though the main thermal benefit of urban greening is increasing people's access to shade.

In a physiology-based approach, all the parameters with sufficiently high-quality data can be integrated into models to estimate three factors: a person's core body temperature, their level of dehydration and the strain on their heart and circulatory system8. In our pilot studies in Sydney, Australia, we incorporated six parameters: ambient temperature, thermal radiation level, humidity level, wind speed, a person's level of activity and the thermal and evaporative properties of their clothing. (Physiological acclimatization — the well-understood physiological adjustments that occur when a person is repeatedly exposed to a hot environment — can also be incorporated.)

Estimates of physiological strain can then be compared with long-established physiological safety thresholds for different groups, on the basis of characteristics such as age, whether the person has a pre-existing condition, what medications they are taking and so on. For example, people with coronary artery disease can tolerate much less cardiovascular strain than healthy individuals can12, and those with heart failure or kidney disease can tolerate less dehydration. The final aggregated score is an individual's ‘heat-health risk' (see ‘Assessing heat-induced health risks using physiology').

Source: O. Jay et al.

The physiological and biophysical models needed for this sort of approach are already available. To provide individuals with a personalized rating of heat-stress risk that uses a six-point scale, two of us (O.J. and F.T.) have developed a freely available Internet tool called HeatWatch (see go.nature.com/44ymweq). This allows users to create personal profiles by submitting their age, related health conditions, medications, access to air conditioning and so on. It then provides a seven-day forecast of heat-health risk and provides evidence-based cooling advice tailored to each profile.

Ultimately, we plan to develop an online interface similar to the dashboards that tracked people's risk of infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an interface could allow governments, public-health organizations, policymakers and others to better anticipate where and when certain groups will face elevated heat-health risks. This should make measures to reduce those risks, such as the deployment of pop-up cooling hubs for people who are homeless, more targeted and cost-effective.

Take a peanut-based paste packed with 500 calories and nearly 13 grams of protein. Store it in a 92-gram foil pouch, so it can be easily sucked by starving infants on the front line. No water or refrigeration is required, meaning it can be distributed in drought-hit areas and stored at ambient temperature for up to two years. Just a couple of daily sachets can lead to a 10 percent weight gain over six weeks, sustaining recovery from severe acute malnutrition for less than $60 per child. Saving a life, it turns out, literally costs peanuts: just 71 cents a serving.

This life-saving mixture is Plumpy'Nut. Developed by Normandy-based manufacturer Nutriset in 1996 by French paediatrician André Briend, it was the first ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF): energy-dense pastes that have boosted survival rates of severe acute malnutrition in children from less than 25 per cent to around 90 percent.

The paste has saved tens of millions of lives. “It's incredibly effective emergency food,” says medical doctor Steve Collins, founder of advocacy group Valid Nutrition. “RUTF contains all the essential nutrients required for someone to recover from severe acute malnutrition. They're easy to transport, extremely energy dense, and don't require a cold supply chain or clean water to work.”

While Nutriset's product was the first RUTF to be developed, it is not the only brand in this important field. Mana, for example, is an American-made RUTF produced in Fitzgerald, Georgia. The company states it can make 500,000 pounds of product per day—enough to fill four shipping containers, and feed 10 million children per year.

Before Plumpy'Nut, cases of severe acute malnutrition—primarily occurring among children under 5 years old, diagnosed by very low weight-for-height scores and arm circumference—needed round-the-clock care at therapeutic feeding centres. Nurses at these makeshift hospitals in often remote areas would feed infants F100, a high-energy milk powder also made by Nutriset. Bacteria was often rife. “There was always a risk that water was contaminated and carried disease,” says Collins. It's one of the reasons why mortality rates for in-patient care lurked at around 20 percent.

Over half of Plumpy'Nut is made from peanut paste and vegetable oils. The nutty primary base contains fat-soluble nutrients, as well as protein, energy, and fatty acids that spark recovery. Nearly a quarter is skimmed milk powder, containing dairy protein and essential amino acids, the building blocks of protein. Another quarter is reserved for sugar—masking the taste of the added micronutrients: potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, zinc, iodine, copper, selenium, and vitamins A, D, E, B complex, C, and K.

The apocryphal story is that Briend's idea for the marvel that is Plumpy'Nut came from a jar of Nutella. In reality, it came from firsthand experience on the front line in the Sahel: The water-based solution wasn't working—infants were still dying. Working with Nutriset founder Michel Lescanne, his idea was to add F100 to a spread of peanuts (a common crop in areas of malnutrition and a natural protein-rich source) with oil and sugar.

High in calories, low in maintenance, Plumpy'Nut didn't require cooling nor mixing before eating. Its oil base removed the risk of bacterial contamination. And most of its energy is released through fat, meaning quick absorption of micronutrients.

Employees in 2005 at Nutriset working on the peanut-based RUTF Plumpy'nut manufacturing line in Malaunay in Normandy, France. The recipe remains practically unchanged 20 years later.

The premade RUTF sachet is a magic formula, says Collins. In starvation cases, refeeding syndrome can occur, a life-threatening metabolic condition in which nutrition that's too rapidly reintroduced leads to electrolyte imbalance. But RUTFs mean children can safely gain weight. “As opposed to highly-concentrated formulas, where a child could easily overeat, parents can simply give their child RUTF and it's safe—the only limiting factor is appetite.”

Collins first came across Plumpy'Nut in the 1998 Sudan famine, where he set up therapeutic feeding centers. “I quickly realized this was the future,” he says, “and that these sachets had to be administered at home, not at in-patient facilities.” He helped establish Plumpy'Nut's first widescale rollout during the 2000 Ethiopia famine, and pioneered a new community-based model: Parents would provide the emergency food rather than health care workers. It was adopted by the United Nations in 2004, and mortality rates for severe acute malnutrition with RUTF treatment are now typically under 5 percent.

Besides reduced sachet plastic and minor refinement of vitamin and mineral premixes, Plumpy'Nut remains nearly the same 30 years on. “No changes to the formulation have ever been done,” says Salima Boitout, group communication manager at Nutriset. It's still the RUTF gold standard. UNICEF is its number-one customer, distributing around 80 percent of the world's supply. It's why, despite the 20-year international patent expiring by 2018, very few alternative products have emerged, as they must meet strict technical composition guidelines set by the WHO and UNICEF.

Some RUTF have reached Gaza—but supplies are rapidly dwindling. Amid mounting evidence of widespread starvation and famine, these sachets are the number one treatment, says Emmanuel Berbain, nutrition adviser at Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). “From what we've seen on the ground, we're in a famine situation already, where deterioration isn't a matter of months, weeks, or days—it's hours.”

There were at least 63 malnutrition-related deaths in the Gaza Strip in July, including 24 children under 5, according to data from the WHO. Since May, aid has been run by the Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), led by private American contractors. Only four distribution centers are open to feed a population of more than 2 million.

Berbain says plenty of RUTF sachets lie at Israel's borders. More than 6,000 aid trucks, waiting in Egypt and Jordan, some only miles away from the Gazan border, are loaded with emergency food and medicine. But according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa), Israel has denied entry. Authorities have since announced that a daily convoy of 200 aid trucks can enter the strip. “We know how to treat starvation, it's nothing new, and used in nearly every humanitarian crisis this century,” adds Berbain. “Distributing pasta isn't enough—you need to cook it, which isn't feasible for many people. And a diet of just wheat can lead to malnourishment.”

Due to funding cuts, only around 36,000 tons of Plumpy'Nut RUTF was produced worldwide in 2024—approximately 1 million sachets a day.

As starvation bites and famine takes hold, MSF nutrition clinics in Gaza are fast running out of RUTF stock, claims Berbain. But there are broader supply chain concerns. The shuttering of USAID has led to hundreds of thousands of boxes of Plumpy'Nut sachets collecting dust in warehouses around the world.

With global aid distribution networks throttled, one stockpile includes 5,000 tons of Plumpy'Nut, worth $13 million, that could feed more than 484,000 children, according to US manufacturer Edesia. Part of Nutriset's PlumpyField global network, the Rhode Island site has operational capacity for 1.5 million Plumpy'Nut sachets a day—a sizable chunk of the 134,198 total tons of all Nutriset products processed by producers in 2023. However, due to funding cuts, just 72,000 tons of Nutriset RUTF and supplements were produced worldwide in 2024, half of which was Plumpy'Nut—approximately 1 million sachets a day.

US foreign aid cuts are also depleting UNICEF's RUTF stocks. It warned in March that supply was running short in 17 countries, affecting 2.4 million children suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Widespread famine is also occurring in Sudan. “The pipeline is drying up,” says Kirk Prichard, vice president of programs for humanitarian charity Concern US. “Cameroon is expected to run out of RUTF this month, with Nigeria and Somalia soon to follow.”

The US Department of State, which now administers foreign assistance programs following the official closure of USAID on July 1, didn't respond to a WIRED request for comment.

Collins has now developed a plant-based emergency food with similar efficacy to Plumpy'Nut but made with soy, maize, and sorghum. It could be the future of RUTF, provided to children with hidden lactose intolerance or peanut allergies. But funding for the project dried up in 2021, meaning Valid Nutrition's factory in Malawi had to be closed. The group is now exploring third-party processors to manufacture the product.

Collins believes it's symptomatic of a broader problem that's completely man-made: Politics often comes before the lives of innocent, starving people. “With humanitarian access and space to operate, you could treat all cases in Gaza within a week with RUTF,” he says. “Without it, recovery rates will be low and slow. They'll be more vulnerable to death.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Science Reveals the Surprising Origins of the Potato","https://www.wired.com/story/science-reveals-the-surprising-origins-of-the-potato/","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 15:43:29 GMT","

There are more than a hundred ways to prepare a potato, and thousands of stories have begun with a shot of vodka distilled from this tuber. For centuries, the potato has been instrumental in feeding the world's growing population. According to one study, the introduction of the potato from the Americas accounted for about a quarter of the population growth in the Old World between 1700 and 1900.

Now, science reveals the vegetable's surprising origins: It emerged 9 million years ago as a result of an unusual hybridization between an ancestor of the tomato and an ancient South American plant. This revelation rewrites the evolutionary history of one of the world's most widely consumed foods and also explains how a simple tuber became a mainstay of the global diet.

Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences conducted the most extensive genomic analysis to date on the domesticated potato. They studied cultivated varieties along with 44 wild species, conducting unprecedented genetic sequencing. The results revealed a stable mixture of genetic material between Solanum tuberosum (the traditional potato) and an ancestor of Solanum lycopersicum (the tomato).

The finding suggests that potatoes as we know them today arose from a process of hybridization between an ancient tomato plant and other Solanum-related species from the Etuberosum family that, until then, did not produce tubers. The results have been published in the journal Cell.

Both the potato and the tomato share a common ancestor that lived about 13 million years ago. Four million years later, their descendants successfully interbred. From this union emerged a new plant with the ability to form tubers: subway structures that store energy in the form of carbohydrates and allow reproduction without the need for seeds or pollination. This biological innovation facilitated the expansion of the first potatoes into regions with diverse climates, from warm to cold environments.

The study also identified revealing genetic details. The SP6A gene, considered the “switch” that determines whether a plant will develop tubers, comes from the tomato. On the other hand, the IT1 gene, which regulates the growth of the subway stems that form the edible tuber, comes from plants of the Etuberosum family, native to South America.

By considering the chronology of the hybridization and the geolocation of the species involved, the researchers proposed a hypothesis about the origin of the potato. During the Miocene, between 10 and 6 million years ago, the abrupt geological uplift of the Andes, driven by the collision of two tectonic plates, generated new cold climatic regions. Scientists believe this geological change forced plants to adapt to survive and expand, with two of them joining together to form Solanum tuberosum, which millions of years later would end up accompanying your hamburger in the form of French fries.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The US Military Is Raking in Millions From On-Base Slot Machines","https://www.wired.com/story/us-military-on-base-slot-machines-gambling-addiction/","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

When Dave Yeager stumbled upon the chamber of shiny, casino-style slot machines, he felt an instant pull. It was his first night of deployment in Seoul, South Korea, and the United States Army officer was in a bad headspace. The September 11, 2001, attacks had just happened, and he had a wife and two children under the age of 5 at home whom he missed fiercely. He felt lost.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.

Yeager had never seen a slot machine on a military base before—there weren't any in the US—but he figured trying his luck couldn't make things worse. “As I'm sitting there, the first thing I'm noticing is that my shoulders are relaxing,” Yeager remembers. “Then, I won. In that moment, all the stress, the anxiety, the pain, the hurt, the fear—it washed away.”

Pulling the slot machine's levers felt like a salve—until they didn't. Yeager found another room filled with slot machines at his next base. Over a period of about three months, he spiraled into what he says was a “devastating obsession” with playing the military-run casino games. He eventually drained his savings, sold his stuff, even stole from his unit. He didn't tell anyone what was going on. “I thought no one could help me,” he says.

While not everyone who plays the slots struggles like Yeager did, a growing body of evidence indicates that veterans and service members are more likely to struggle with gambling disorders than civilians, says Shane W. Kraus, an associate professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who studies gambling disorders. Service members also tend to be more hesitant to seek help, out of fear of losing rank, security clearance, or being dishonorably discharged, he adds.

Not much has changed since Yeager served—in fact, within the last five years, the slot machine programs the military runs have been making increasing amounts of cash. And, some advocates say, they're not funneling enough of what they make into education on problem gambling.

The Army Recreation Machine Program (ARMP) currently operates 1,889 slot machines in 79 locations abroad, including Korea, Japan, and Germany, according to Neil Gumbs, general manager, Army Recreation Machine Program (ARMP) Installation Management Command (IMCOM). The ARMP brought in $70.9 million from its slot machine operations during the 2024 fiscal year, according to a document obtained by WIRED. That year, the ARMP made $53 million in net proceeds. (The ARMP program covers slots on Army, Navy, and Marine Corps bases, while the Air Force also has their own version of the program.)

Those figures have been increasing. In the fiscal year 2023, the ARMP brought in $64.8 million in revenue, with $48.9 million in net proceeds. The year before, it made $63.1 million in revenue with net proceeds of $47.3 million, according to documents obtained through a public records request made by this reporter through the Data Liberation Project.

From October 2024 to May 2025, the ARMP's “house” has had some solid wins. They generated about $47.7 million from players in that period, records obtained by WIRED show. Comparatively, the total return to players from October 2024 to May 2025 was about $37 million in reportable jackpots over $1,200.

In its heyday, the ARMP brought in over $100 million in revenue, per a 2017 report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), but money-in dwindled substantially between 2010 to 2020, which Gumbs attributed to “movement and reductions in force and installations.” Things began to grow again after 2020. This was partly a boost from Covid-19 boredom, along with “renewed investment in new equipment and cost/expense reductions aided in increasing entertainment on offer,” Gumbs says.

This was a few years after the ARMP installed “Morning Calm,” a popular gambling room on the Army base Camp Humphreys in South Korea (likely a reference to the country's nickname, “The Land of the Morning Calm”). Slots at the Morning Calm location bring in considerably more than other bases, securing the ARMP more than $6 million from October 2024 through May 2025. Second place? “Ocean Breeze” at Camp Butler/Foster in Japan.

With names like that, you'd think these locations were offering serenity—not siphoning savings. But folks like Yeager claim that's exactly what they're doing.

When asked for comment on Yeager's experience, the ARMP's Gumbs said: “ARMP is affiliated with the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG). Additionally, we promote responsible gambling, and all gaming areas and machines prominently display the national gambling hotline number.” A spokesperson for the NCPG notes that the ARMP became a member as of June 2025, after WIRED began looking into this story.

The ARMP also says it tracks which kinds of gaming machines people play the most, and how much revenue comes from each kind. For instance, 88 Fortunes—a progressive jackpot game inspired by Asian culture—is one of the most popular. It brought in more than $3 million to the house between October 2024 and May 2025. Another game, Novomatic Impera HD 5, brought in $4.3 million during that period.

Operations like Morning Calm appear much more organized than what Yeager remembers from his time in the service: “It's like they had an extra back room, so they threw 50 slot machines in there,” Yeager recalls. He describes some rooms as the size of an average fast-food chain dining room, though the one he played in most in Seoul had maybe 200 machines. He says the atmosphere is “club-like” and dark.

Not all of ARMP cash is coming from service members—local civilians, retirees, veterans, and contractors who work on bases can also play—but a portion of the money the house generates is taken from a vulnerable population that's literally putting their existence on the line for their country.

The money doesn't go into thin air. The ARMP's earnings go back into each branch's Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR). Some of it pays for entertainment on bases, such as golf courses, bowling alleys, and libraries. “Proceeds that are returned to MWR are decided and allocated by the garrison commander at each installation,” Gumbs tells WIRED via email. (Garrison commanders are leaders sometimes described as “city managers” of Army installations.) Yeager and other experts say the work the MWR does is important. But he and other experts argue that the military must invest more in prevention, education, and treatment from problem gambling.

Even though Congress banned gambling devices from domestic US bases in 1951, it's done little to curb the ARMP on bases abroad. In the early 2000s, Congress asked the Pentagon to study how on-base slots impacted military families like Yeager's. The Pentagon originally hired consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to do the study, but within months ended the contract to complete the research itself. Rachel Volberg, who worked on the original PricewaterhouseCoopers report, tells WIRED that, while she was never told exactly why they decided to take it in-house, she got the strong impression “they didn't want the money to disappear because they were using it to fund recreational activities for enlisted folks.” She remembers chaplains as the main authority figures in leadership who took the issue seriously.

The final report didn't reference new problem-gambling rates, but noted that the military couldn't keep many of its morale operations like golf courses running “without slot machine revenue or a significant new source of cash.”

Volberg now studies problem gambling at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.# Asked for comment on the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, an IMCOM spokesperson, referred WIRED to the Pentagon, which referred WIRED back to the Army. The Army's Public Affairs team also didn't respond to a request from WIRED on this matter.

After the 2017 GAO report raised concerns, Congress passed a provision under the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which, for the first time, required screening for gambling disorders every year for service members. A 2018 bill that would have required the DOD to create policies and programs to prevent and treat gambling disorders failed to gain traction.

Last year, US representative Paul Tonko, a New York Democrat, proposed an amendment to the NDAA that would ban the operation of slots on bases. That didn't pass either. “Our brave service men and women sacrifice everything,” Tonko tells WIRED. “We must do all we can to support them by confronting problem gambling head-on.”

Perhaps counterintuitively, Yeager disagrees with abolishing the ARMP outright. “They do generate money for good causes,” he says, noting that having recreation on bases is key, particularly since eliminating the slots won't eliminate ways to bet online, or the boredom and anxiety many service members feel.

Instead, he wishes the ARMP would dedicate more of its millions to helping folks struggling like he did. “Rather than just eliminate them, why don't you mandate a small percentage of that money be turned back over into education, screening, and treatment?” Yeager says. He'd like to see a broad education campaign and more controls.

Other advocates want to see more money put into research and treatment programs, along with adding responsible gambling tools and information, says Cait Huble, communications director for the NCPG. In a 2022 review of the DOD's responsible gambling policies compared with those of US states, the Kindbridge Research Institute, a nonprofit that focuses on gambling-related issues faced by veterans and other groups, found the DOD had the worst, compared to other jurisdictions with legal slot machine gambling in America.

When asked for comment on this report and whether more responsible gambling tools have been put in place since the Kindbridge review, Gumbs said that “proceeds that are returned to MWR are decided and allocated by the garrison commander at each installation,” and reiterated ARMP's affiliation with NCPG and its commitment to “responsible gambling.” Another IMCOM spokesperson tells WIRED the NCPG partnership “provides us with insights, tools, and materials that help increase the visibility of responsible gaming at our locations, while also keeping ARMP aligned with the broader industry and any real-time updates from NCPG.”

In 2020, the Army updated its regulations to “provide information” to both soldiers and civilians about problem gambling. However, Huble says this isn't enough. “Checking the box and saying: ‘We have information, there's a brochure in the health office,' it's certainly different than making sure that clinicians and even commanders are trained in how to handle a situation where a soldier says they have a gambling problem.”

Meanwhile, another GAO report on problem gambling is expected, but some, like responsible gambling lobbyist Brianne Doura-Schawohl, say it's “long overdue.” It's also unclear how recent funding cuts by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the administration of President Donald Trump, a former casino mogul, will impact the report and future policy.

Yeager says that any recent DOD updates to gambling prevention policy have been “rudimentary at best,” adding: “There's still a long way to go.”

For years, Yeager felt that neither the Army nor the Department of Veterans Affairs knew how to help him. That is, until 2007. He showed up to the VA (not for the first time) looking for help. By this time, he'd been disciplined and eventually released by the Army for his gambling, had separated from his wife, and survived multiple suicide attempts. Finally, a counselor dug through her desk and procured a pamphlet. “I swear to god, she blew the dust off of it before handing it to me,” he says.

It mentioned one of the VA's few gambling treatment programs in the country, located in Ohio. This was what finally helped him. Now, he's in recovery, spending his time working to improve the way the DOD handles problem gambling. “Because I didn't fulfill my obligation as a noncommissioned officer, I try to fulfill it now as a veteran in recovery,” he says. “This is where I try to pay it forward.”

If Yeager could talk to defense secretary Pete Hegseth today, he has one main message to get across, starting but not ending with the gambling rooms “where the seed of gambling disorder was planted,” he says. “Educating soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen that this is a real addiction and that there's treatment that could improve readiness and could bring people out of the woodwork who are scared to go to treatment,” he says. “It would not be difficult to do.”

I know you've seen Skelly at some point in the past five years. Maybe it was driving around your neighborhood during Halloween, or on a viral post about Halloween decorations. Maybe both! Maybe it's in your friend's yard year-round, wearing a Santa hat for Christmas and rocking 2025 glasses with a bottle of champagne for the new year. (Maybe that's just my friend's yard.)

The popular 12-foot skeleton, aptly named Skelly, has become a Halloween classic (and a permanent yard mainstay for the Halloween elite) since it launched in 2020. This year, Home Depot is launching a few new items in its Halloween collection, including a brand-new, tech-powered Ultra Skelly ($279).

Ultra Skelly is the souped-up tech edition of original Skelly, with customizable ribcage lights and eyes, four movements it can perform, preset and custom audio recordings it can repeat, a live audio option, and a motion sensor to activate it. It's shorter than the 12-foot icon, but 6 1/2 feet is nothing to scoff at, either. That just means Ultra Skelly can fit next to your front door and jump-scare your trick-or-treaters.

On the visual side, there's a light built into Ultra Skelly's mouth and chest, both of which have a full spectrum of color you can choose from in the newly revamped DecorPro SVI app (Android and iOs), which Home Depot launched last week. The most fun visual, though, is Skelly's new LCD eyes, which feature 18 different styles to choose from. There are options for both Halloween and holidays beyond, from skull and red human eyes to hearts, snowflakes, and birthday confetti. There are also a handful of non-holiday options, like blue, green, and brown eyes.

As for the audio and animatronics, Ultra Skelly has four movements with its head, mouth, arm, and torso that you can control. This high-tech skeleton also comes with five preset audio recordings and the ability to record up to 30 seconds of your own audio, which you can manipulate with eerie voice modulation. There's a live audio mode too, if you wanted to speak through Ultra Skelly while sitting out of sight.

The DecorPro SVI app works with Bluetooth, so you'll need to be within range to customize Ultra Skelly and use live audio. Ultra Skelly doesn't connect to Wi-Fi, so it's not technically smart, but it still packs plenty of futuristic fun for the holidays.

Ultra Skelly isn't the only new addition to the skeleton family. There's a new version of Skelly's best friend: a 5-foot Sitting Skelly's Dog ($249) that will also have customizable eyes. The 7-foot standing version ($199) of the dog is back as well. This year, cat people will also be recognized with a new 5-foot Skelly's Cat ($199). The original 12-foot Skelly ($299) will return, and after a year of price raises across markets, it's nice to see it has actually stayed the same price. This regular Skelly also has customizable LCD eyes, albeit with only eight options. Ultra Skelly ($279) is actually the cheaper of the two Skelly options, even with all its cool features, but it is nearly half the size.

All of these are available today on Home Depot's website and in the Home Depot app, along with the rest of Home Depot's Halloween collections. If you're looking for something else fun, don't miss the 15-foot haunted scarecrow ($399), 8-foot animated Wyvern ($399), and so much more. Happy Halloween, my fellow spooky friends.

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

Amazon is laying off 110 people as part of a restructuring of its Wondery podcast network business, according to Bloomberg. 

Amazon is moving existing Wondery operations into the company's Audible unit or a new “creator services” team, Bloomberg reported, citing a memo to staff. 

Wondery CEO Jen Sargent will leave the company as part of the changes. 

Amazon acquired Wondery's podcast production studio in 2020 in a bid to move further into original audio content and podcasts — but that strategy “hasn't worked out as planned,” Bloomberg noted, amid a shift for podcasts to a video-first approach and competition from Spotify and YouTube.

Update: Amazon confirmed that roughly 110 roles were impacted, with some Wondery employees moving to other parts of Amazon. Wondery will continue to develop and produce creator-led podcasts.

AI may be coming for your job — but not if you're operating machinery, building tires, or replacing roofs. 

A new study from Microsoft reveals which jobs are most — and least — susceptible to generative AI, based on an analysis of 200,000 anonymized conversations with Bing Copilot users in 2024.

The study mapped conversations to work activities using the U.S. government's job classification system and calculated an “AI applicability score” for each occupation. 

Knowledge work and communication-focused occupations dominate the high-vulnerability categories. Jobs involving manual labor, physical presence, or machinery operation ranked lowest. 

The research is unique because it analyzed actual AI usage from Copilot conversations in 2024 rather than relying on theoretical assessments.

The researchers noted that their data only shows AI capability overlap with work activities, not actual job displacement. Historical examples show automation can sometimes increase rather than decrease employment in affected sectors.

Here were the top 25 occupations most and least impacted by AI, based on the AI applicability score in the study.

[Editor's note: “Tech Vets: Profiles in Leadership and Innovation,” is a GeekWire series showcasing U.S. military veterans leading companies within the Pacific Northwest tech industry. The series explores how military experience fosters leadership, resilience, and innovation in tech.]

Tyler LeRoy is helping build Washington state's carbon capture ecosystem — a mission that began with an underwater deployment in the tropical Pacific that revealed his professional calling.

As the program manager for the CleanTech Alliance's WECAN (Washington Energy: Carbon Advancement Network) innovation cluster, Leroy works to advance policy, education and market support for carbon removal and capture businesses. It's a role that combines his U.S. Army training and education with his passion for combating climate change.

During an Army operation in Palau in 2020, LeRoy served as company commander, leading diving projects that included maintenance on navigation buoys and other submerged infrastructure offshore of the island nation.

But before that work got started, COVID-19 policies required his team to isolate in individual hotel rooms for two weeks. It gave the West Point graduate plenty of time to reflect on his future and what mattered to him, including his concern over the devastating impacts of climate change on marine environments.

“The military really pounds in their values into you, and emphasizes living a values-driven life,” LeRoy said. For the Army that includes loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity and personal courage, which he and his wife have developed into a framework for themselves and their three children.

“I try my best to live those [values],” LeRoy said, “and be that person.”

He emerged from the mission with the goal of pursuing a career in clean energy and addressing the root causes of climate change.

In June, LeRoy earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington with a focus on renewable energy systems, which complements his earlier master's in engineering management from the Missouri University of Science and Technology.

Since January, he has channeled his Army background and university education into his work at the Seattle-based CleanTech Alliance.

The Pacific Northwest offers ideal conditions for carbon reduction efforts that leverage timber industry waste, marine chemistry, and mineralization in rock formations. Local entrepreneurs and researchers are developing these nature-based solutions alongside more engineered approaches for capturing carbon from industrial processes.

LeRoy's engineering background prepped him for talking to smart people with expertise in wide-ranging areas, even if it's a specialty field he doesn't know well. His experience as an Army officer additionally gave him the confidence to lead groups of diverse individuals and interests, engage in challenging conversations and work toward solutions.

Mel Clark, president and CEO of the nonprofit CleanTech Alliance, expected these qualities given LeRoy's military history. Clark, who also attended West Point before graduating from the UW, anticipated that LeRoy would be “detail-oriented, organized, able to bring rapid decision-making to a fast-paced environment, a thoughtful manager, and willing to ask tough questions — all while keeping the mission top of mind.”

With LeRoy's leadership, the WECAN innovation cluster is gaining momentum. Its advisory board has convened twice, and Leroy is eager to drive policies that will unlock carbon capture technologies and accelerate deployment.

LeRoy credits his military experience for instilling an operations-focused mindset that supports his efforts to make a positive impact on people and the planet.

“I come from that perspective of, ‘we said we're going to do this, and I don't care if we work through the weekend, it's getting done,'” he said. “A lot of veterans just have that mentality.”

The Gates Foundation today announced a $2.5 billion, five-year initiative focused on women's health that will support innovation in care, bolster data collection and aims to catalyze additional investments. 

The effort represents the largest ever commitment to women's health research and development, addressing a significant funding gap. A 2021 McKinsey study found that only 1% of healthcare R&D is invested in female-specific conditions beyond oncology, while a 2023 report from international health organizations found that a woman dies every two minutes due to pregnancy or childbirth. 

The initiative is centered on five areas that the philanthropy believes have been overlooked and are primed for breakthroughs with wide-reaching impacts:

About 60% of the funding will be focused on obstetrics and maternal health. The philanthropy is supporting 40 innovations and 70% of the new investment will go towards R&D and product development, foundation leaders said on a call Monday with global media.

“I've seen firsthand what happens when there's a lack of attention paid to women's health conditions,” said Dr. Ru Cheng, director of women's health innovations at Gates Foundation. “There's no solutions. There's delays in diagnosis. Or the solutions that exist are very old, and they lack features that make it such that women actually want to use them.”

Promising new technologies include an injectable, discreet contraceptive for women that lasts for six months, and the use of artificial intelligence with ultrasounds so any primary health care provider will be able to read them. 

The organization emphasized that the investments are meant to help women in low-resource communities worldwide, including the U.S. Idaho, for example, has lost 35% of its obstetrician-gynecologist physicians since the state began implementing strict abortion bans in 2022. 

“Investing in women's health has a lasting impact across generations. It leads to healthier families, stronger economies, and a more just world,” said Bill Gates, chair of the Gates Foundation, in a statement. 

“Yet women's health continues to be ignored, underfunded, and sidelined,” he added. “Too many women still die from preventable causes or live in poor health. That must change. But we can't do it alone.”

The Seattle-based philanthropy is the world's largest private foundation. In May, Gates committed to giving away $200 billion — including nearly all of his wealth — over the next two decades through the foundation. The organization is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year and will sunset its operations on Dec. 31, 2045. 

The global public health sector is facing additional challenges following recent changes to U.S. foreign aid policy. The Trump administration is dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) — a move that could lead to 14 million additional deaths worldwide by the end of this decade, according to new research. 

Looking at the $2.5 billion initiative, “we're approaching it as a moment to catalyze the entire community, the global ecosystem around women's health research and development,” Cheng said. “It's really an invitation, it's a call to action, and it's really to highlight the urgency and the need.”

AI startup Perplexity is crawling and scraping content from websites that have explicitly indicated they don't want to be scraped, according to internet infrastructure provider Cloudflare.

On Monday, Cloudflare published research saying it observed the AI startup ignore blocks and hide its crawling and scraping activities. The network infrastructure giant accused Perplexity of obscuring its identity when trying to scrape web pages “in an attempt to circumvent the website's preferences,” Cloudflare's researchers wrote.

AI products like those offered by Perplexity rely on gobbling up large amounts of data from the internet, and AI startups have long scraped text, images, and videos from the internet many times without permission to make their products work. In recent times, websites have tried to fight back by using the web standard Robots.txt file, which tells search engines and AI companies which pages can be indexed and which shouldn't, efforts that have seen mixed results so far. 

Perplexity appears to be willingly circumventing these blocks by changing its bots “user agent,” meaning a signal that identifies a website visitor by their device and version type; as well as changing their autonomous system networks, or ASN, essentially a number that identifies large networks on the internet, according to Cloudflare. 

“This activity was observed across tens of thousands of domains and millions of requests per day. We were able to fingerprint this crawler using a combination of machine learning and network signals,” read Cloudflare's post. 

Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer dismissed Cloudflare's blog post as a “sales pitch,” adding in an email to TechCrunch that the screenshots in the post “show that no content was accessed.” In a follow-up email, Dwyer claimed the bot named in the Cloudflare blog “isn't even ours.”

Cloudflare said it first noticed the behavior after its customers complained that Perplexity was crawling and scraping their sites, even after they added rules on their Robots file and for specifically blocking Perplexity's known bots. Cloudflare said it then performed tests to check and confirmed that Perplexity was circumventing these blocks. 

“We observed that Perplexity uses not only their declared user-agent, but also a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome on macOS when their declared crawler was blocked,” according to Cloudflare.  

The company also said that it has de-listed Perplexity's bots from its verified list and added new techniques to block them. 

Cloudflare has recently taken a public stance against AI crawlers. Last month, Cloudflare announced the launch of a marketplace allowing website owners and publishers to charge AI scrapers who visit their sites. Cloudflare's chief executive Matthew Prince sounded the alarm at the time, saying AI is breaking the business model of the internet, particularly publishers. Last year, Cloudflare also launched a free tool to prevent bots from scraping websites to train AI. 

This is not the first time Perplexity is accused of scraping without authorization. 

Last year, news outlets, such as Wired, alleged Perplexity was plagiarizing their content. Weeks later, Perplexity's CEO Aravind Srinivas was unable to immediately answer when asked to provide the company's definition of plagiarism during an interview with TechCrunch's Devin Coldewey at the Disrupt 2024 conference.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is in what one might describe a suboptimal position. He's pushed hard to get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, not a maker of EVs. And yet, the company's most visible products, which generate the bulk of its revenues, are its electric cars. 

Yes, Tesla EVs are advanced, particularly when it comes to its underlying vehicle architecture and software. And its driver-assistance system known as Full Self-Driving Supervised, which can be used on highways and city streets and requires hands on the wheel and the driver to be ready to take over, is considered among the most capable on the market today. But to Musk, the ultimate illustration of an AI and robotics company is self-driving cars and humanoid robots. And today, neither of them exist at any scale. 

Tesla's first notable step toward that goal was in June when it launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. Those Robotaxi-branded vehicles, which invited customers can hail via an app, have a Tesla employee sitting in the front passenger seat. But it's still far from Musk's original vision of a “general solution” that would allow a Tesla owner to earn money by renting out their vehicle as a robotaxi service. 

The clock is ticking and Musk needs to show more progress — or at the very least tease upcoming launches to keep antsy shareholders content. Which is perhaps why Tesla is embarking on this ride-hailing gambit in California.

Earlier this month, Musk noted that Tesla would be launching a robotaxi service in the Bay Area “in a month or two” — regulatory approvals being the primary hang-up.

The problem? Tesla hasn't even applied for the permits that would allow it to operate a robotaxi service. I checked Friday morning with the California DMV, which regulates driverless testing, and Tesla has not yet applied for the necessary permits. (A spokesperson did tell me the DMV met with Tesla to discuss the company's plans to test autonomous vehicles in the state.)

So, instead Tesla has launched a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area. And yeah, users keep calling these robotaxis. 

To be clear, while folks — including Musk's brother and Tesla board member Kimbal Musk — may refer to these as robotaxis, they are not driving autonomously. (And if they are, it would be a violation of current regulations.) Again, Tesla does not currently have the permits to do anything beyond pay its own employees to use its fleet of EVs to drive people around the Bay Area. No autonomous driving in any way, shape, or form. You can read a recent explainer here that will take you through all of the various permits Tesla needs.

This ride-hailing launch has many folks wondering, what gives? My answer: optics.

Recent chatter among some little birds suggests that the National Automobile Dealers Association is focusing its efforts on VW Group spinout Scout and the EV company's plans for direct sales. The dealership industry group has opposed the direct sales model before. But unlike direct-sales adopters Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid, Scout is attached to a legacy automaker with a long-established dealer network.

Think back to the fall of 2023. Logistics company Flexport had captured the attention of Silicon Valley, in part because of founder Ryan Petersen's fallout with ousted CEO Dave Clark and because of its acquisition of Convoy, the former freight tech unicorn that had just shut down. 

Here's an update. Flexport has now sold the Convoy platform to DAT Freight & Analytics. The terms were undisclosed, although the company said it had delivered a “massive return on investment for Flexport.” Reporting from Axios' Dan Primack suggests that, yes, indeed “massive return” is an appropriate description. 

Flexport never disclosed exactly what it had paid for Convoy's tech, although reporting at the time put the figure at $16 million — a fraction of the unicorn's previous valuation of $3.8 billion. Primack reported this week that Flexport sold the Convoy platform for $250 million. 

Other deals that got my attention this week …

AIR, an Israel-based startup developing eVTOLs, raised $23 million in a Series A funding round led by Entrée Capital, with participation from existing backer Dr. Shmuel Harlap, an early investor in Mobileye. 

LG Innotek, the components and materials subsidiary of South Korea's LG Group, is investing up to $50 million in Aeva, acquiring an equity stake of about 6% in the U.S. lidar company. The investment is part of a broader manufacturing partnership between the two companies and marks Aeva's push into consumer electronics, robotics, and industrial automation. 

Aurora shared some notable progress in its Q2 earnings report. The autonomous vehicle tech company has three self-driving trucks operating commercially between Dallas and Houston, logging more than 20,000 driverless miles by the end of June. It is piloting driverless trucks on a 15-hour route from its terminal in Fort Worth, Texas, to a new terminal in Phoenix and is operating at night. CEO Chris Urmson told me what is next on his list.

Elon Musk's tunnel-digging company The Boring Company plans to build a 10-mile “loop” that will connect Nashville's downtown and its convention center and airport. Important side notes: This will be funded by The Boring Company and its private partners, which are not named. And this is the start of a public process to evaluate routes, which means work won't be starting right away.

Ford plans to reveal more information about its upcoming low-cost electric vehicles at an event in Kentucky on August 11. And, as senior reporter Sean O'Kane notes, the company is talking a very big game.

Joby Aviation has signed an agreement with defense contractor L3Harris Technologies to “explore opportunities” to develop a new aircraft class — specifically, a gas-turbine hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft that can fly autonomously — for defense applications. The gas-turbine hybrid VTOL will be based on Joby's current S4 aircraft platform. This isn't a contract, per se. But it does mark progress in Joby's bid to go to market in the defense and consumer sectors.

While Uber continues to partner with every autonomous vehicle company under the sun, Lyft is trying to make its own deals. Lyft said it will add autonomous shuttles made by Austrian manufacturer Benteler Group to its network in late 2026. The shuttles will be deployed in partnership with U.S. cities and airports.

Waymo plans to launch a robotaxi service next year in Dallas, and this time it is partnering with Avis Budget Group to manage its fleet of autonomous vehicles. In other Waymo happenings, two of its robotaxis crashed into each other at one of the company's staging lots in Phoenix this week, proving that the company's rapid expansion into new cities does not mean it has ironed out all the kinks. Waymo says it's investigating the cause.

Chinese AV company WeRide received an autonomous driving permit from Saudi Arabia. The company holds similar permits in China, the UAE, Singapore, France, and the United States.

Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana will join the Disrupt Stage for a wide-ranging conversation on the current state of AVs — and where the industry goes from here. TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 will be held October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco.

Amazon is denying that it's shutting down Wondery, the podcast studio it acquired in late 2020, after Bloomberg reported on Monday that the company was closing the studio and cutting 110 jobs.

Amazon told TechCrunch that Wondery will continue to develop creator-led podcasts under the Wondery brand within a new team. What's changing is that the company is separating the teams that oversee Wondery's narrative podcast efforts from those developing its creator-led shows. 

Wondery is combining its narrative podcast studio, which includes podcasts like Dr. Death and American Scandal, with Audible. 

“The podcast landscape has evolved significantly in the past few years, particularly with the rise of video-forward, creator-led content,” Amazon said in an emailed statement. 

“These changes reflect that evolution and will streamline how Wondery integrates further into Amazon. By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels, help them expand their brand IP, and simplify the process for advertisers while making content more accessible to audiences wherever they prefer to consume it. This evolution builds on Wondery's early success with video-forward shows and positions us to better serve creators, customers, and advertisers.”

Despite securing big names in the business, the company is now shifting its strategy in an effort to better compete with rivals like Spotify and YouTube as the podcasting industry embraces video formats.

Correction: The article has been updated to reflect that Amazon denies reports of Wondery shutting down.

Tesla's board of directors has announced a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk worth around $29 billion in shares, with the company citing the “ever-intensifying AI talent war and Tesla's position at a critical inflection point” as reasons for the payout.

The massive pay package is being allocated through a 2019 Equity Incentive Plan that is already approved by shareholders, so it won't go to a vote, according to a regulatory filing and Ann Lipton, a professor at the University of Colorado Law School. Tesla says it will put “a longer-term CEO compensation strategy” to a vote at the company's annual shareholder meeting, which is scheduled for November.

Musk's new compensation plan will be entirely voided if the Delaware Supreme Court decides to overturn a judge's January 2024 decision to strike down Musk's 2018 compensation package because of how it was negotiated behind the scenes. That pay package was worth around $56 billion.

Musk has threatened to stop working on AI and robotics at Tesla unless he gains more control over the company. Those threats preceded what is now a multimillion-dollar talent war among the biggest companies in the artificial intelligence space, along with a rush of mergers and acquisitions.

At the same time, Musk has built up his own AI company outside Tesla called xAI, which now owns X, his social media platform. This has happened while Tesla's sales growth has vanished and its brand has been damaged by Musk's involvement in the Trump administration.

Tesla said Monday that its board of directors formed a special committee earlier this year consisting of chairwoman Robyn Denholm and board member Kathleen Wilson-Thompson in order to sort out a new package. 

The award they ultimately decided on involves giving Musk 96 million shares that will vest in two years, provided that he “serve continuously in a senior leadership role at Tesla” during that term and holds the stock for five years. Unlike Tesla's previous award to Musk, this new package does not appear to be tied to goals like increasing the company's stock price.

At Tesla's Monday premarket trading price, that would be worth around $29 billion. Musk will have to pay a $23.34-per-share purchase price, bringing the total current value of the award to him to roughly $26.7 billion. Depending on how the Delaware Supreme Court rules on Tesla's appeal, the package may be forfeited so “there cannot be any ‘double dip,' according to Tesla.

“Elon will not be able to keep this new award in addition to the options he will be awarded under the 2018 CEO Performance Award should the courts rule in our favor,” the company wrote.

Tesla said Musk and his brother Kimbal, who is also a board member, recused themselves from the process of constructing this new compensation package. Musk's involvement in the 2018 compensation package was one of the reasons Delaware Chancery Court Judge Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick decided to strike it down following a trial sparked by a shareholder lawsuit.

McCormick said the process of creating that 2018 plan was “deeply flawed” because of Musk's input and his deep connections to the people on Tesla's board. She also criticized that plan for not including any terms that would bind Musk to Tesla for “any set amount of time” — a likely reason for the two-year pledge included in the new plan.

McCormick's decision caused an uproar among Tesla's largest fans and many of its shareholders. It's also what inspired the company to re-incorporate from Delaware to Texas, a state with fewer established shareholder protections written into its laws. Tesla went as far as holding a shareholder vote to “re-affirm” the pay package. But McCormick confirmed her decision in December 2024, saying the vote and Tesla's legal arguments were “unprecedented theories [that] go against multiple strains of settled law.”

Update: This story and the headline have been updated to reflect that the award has been approved by Tesla's board and does not need a shareholder vote.

Google has removed the names of more than 50 DEI groups from a list of companies to which it substantially contributes, according to a new watchdog report and as reported by CNBC.

The list, Google's 2024 selection of groups and organizations backed by Google's U.S. Government Affairs and Public Policy team, no longer features the names of 58 DEI groups, including the Latino Leadership Alliance and the ACLU of Illinois.

When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Google gave the following statement: “This report mischaracterizes our public policy contributions. We contribute to hundreds of groups from across the political spectrum that advocate for pro-innovation policies, and those groups change from year to year based on where our contributions will have the most impact.” 

The discovery of the changes comes after the Trump administration said it would target companies openly showing support for DEI. CNBC points out it's unclear if Google is secretly still supporting these groups, however. This past year, Google said it would no longer have diversity hiring goals, after it removed language referring to “underrepresented” groups from its grant website and removed mention of “diversity” and “equity” from its responsible AI web page; it also removed mention of DEI from its 10-K filings this year. 

The groups dropped from Google's funding list had mission statements using words like “race” and “women,” terms the Trump administration instructed federal agencies to dial back on using, the report said.

This piece was updated to add a response from Google's spokesperson.

Plain Language SummaryWe provide explanation of spectacular naturally occurring bursts of X-rays and accompanying radio emissions that are observed in association with lightning activity in the Earth's atmosphere. These burst events are commonly referred to as terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs). The core physical process leading to these events is avalanche multiplication of relativistic electrons accelerated by force exerted by electric field. In geophysical context, the electric field of sufficient magnitude and spatial extent for supporting these avalanches is generated either as an ambient field due to thundercloud electrification or produced in streamer zones of lightning leaders. These electrons radiate energetic photons (X-rays) as they scatter by nuclei of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in air. These X-rays are radiated in all directions and some fraction is radiated in opposite direction of electron motion. These particular X-rays lead to seeding of new relativistic seed electrons due to the photoelectric effect and thus strong amplification of the original avalanche. It has been established recently that these feedback effects occur on very small spatial scales, and in this work, we report the first fully time-dependent simulations of related dynamics, similarity analysis allowing better understanding of characteristics of events observed at different altitudes, and quantitative comparisons with observations.

This was the root of the article in my opinion:> The issue may have emerged from the fact that PCIe 5.0 was enabled by default, and not clearly marked as experimental, and that may be something AMD did not like to see.However, it seems to just be speculation. I too would like to know what the real reason was. Was Gigabyte dealing with returns/RMAs due to the feature? Was there pressure from AMD to stop allowing their lesser chipset to access PCIe 5.0?

Would be my guess. The fact that the B650 can even do 5.0 on the GPU lanes (it is able to do 4x 5.0 on NVME) makes me wonder if the B650 chipset is the same silicon as B650E and the speed is just really a configuration setting. Across the board the B650 seems like it is the exact same as a de-rated B650E.It would surprise me if motherboard vendors who support 4.0 weren't actually compliant with 5.0 from a signaling / integrity perspective for future proofing and increased headroom.

For example, I'm now running 6000 MT/s on stock VSoC which definitely wasn't possible on my hardware 1.5 years ago.That said, my mobo vendor of choice is not known for doing rug pulls (unlike Gigabyte, who are also fond of releasing several board revisions under the same model with significant differences between them). It's the opposite — for example, a recent BIOS update added support for running internal graphics at 4K/120Hz on the same hardware that could only do 4K/60Hz before.

As Silicon Valley has pushed the world more and more into trying to make the generative AI boom sustain itself, Hollywood is still standing on the precipice of a transformative moment. Studios are grappling with the purported potential (and demands for cost savings) artificial intelligence models may bring, weighed against the legal minefields exploiting such technologies can represent—and an increasing public backlash to the technology.

Disney is certainly no exception, as the company is already familiar with both the legal headaches and the PR nightmare generative AI can represent. But a new report from the Wall Street Journal claims that there've been even more attempts behind the scenes at Disney's studio to try and utilize generative AI technologies… neither of which purportedly went very far or well, for very different reasons.

Two upcoming productions that tried to navigate potential use of generative AI mentioned in the WSJ report are the upcoming live-action Moana remake and Tron: Ares. For the former, Disney reportedly planned to work with an AI company called Metaphysic to create a digital deepfake of actor Dwayne Johnson, set to reprise his role as the demigod Maui in the remake. In an attempt to reduce the number of days Johnson would be required on set for production, the alleged plan was to have Johnson's cousin, Tanoai Reed, act as a stand-in who would have Johnson's deepfaked face put over his performance in post-production.

Although the plan was for a “small number of shots,” according to WSJ's report, after 18 months of negotiation and work between Disney and Metaphysic, none of the shots using Reed's performance will be in the final movie when it releases in July 2026. WSJ's report cited concerns over data security on Disney's end, as well as the legal question that lingers over any broader embrace of generative AI technology in Hollywood: who, exactly, owns the end product when generative AI models are used to create even a part of it?

That thorny question of ownership has already seen Disney take legal action against AI companies over claims of illegal misuse of copyrighted material to train their models. In June this year, Disney teamed up with Universal to sue Midjourney over what the suit described as a “bottomless pit of plagiarism,” accusing the AI company's image generator of breaching copyright laws to distribute and create images trained on the studios' library of characters and franchises.

But copyright is not the only concern Disney faces when it comes to ideas around generative AI: the studio is also increasingly navigating potential publicity nightmares as social backlash to the use of the technology increases.

In another example in WSJ's report, it's alleged that Disney executives pitched creatives on the set of Tron: Ares on including a generative AI character in the film, which itself is already about artificial intelligences escaping the digital world of “The Grid” to be exploited as military contractors in the real world. According to WSJ, the character would've been called “Bit” and acted as a potential companion to Jeff Bridges' returning Kevin Flynn, and built off of context provided by a writer, the generated character would then be recorded and deliver lines performed by an actor, responding as if the model itself were Bit.

The report claims that similarly the idea was stymied again by legal discussions at the time, amid negotiations with unions, as well as the fact that Disney executives were purportedly told to drop the idea internally because “the company couldn't risk the bad publicity.”

Disney is, of course, no stranger to public embarrassment when it comes to its properties and AI, either. Marvel was lambasted for the use of generative AI to create the opening title sequence to its Disney+ series Secret Invasion in 2023, and found itself defending itself from accusations of its use once more for the early marketing campaign for Fantastic Four: First Steps. Earlier this summer, Disney's investment into Epic Games was touted through the arrival of a generative-AI-enhanced Darth Vader avatar in Fortnite to promote the battle royale video game's then-ongoing Star Wars event, “Galactic Battle”, where Darth Vader could be recruited by players, using a deepfake model of the late James Earl Jones' voice to interact with players in real time.

Players promptly figured out ways to get around Epic's content restrictions and get the generative Vader to swear and use slurs. Although Epic managed to fix the bugs within 30 minutes of the Vader character's appearance going live in Fortnite, several videos of the exploits went viral on social media. SAG-AFTRA also filed an unfair labor practice charge against Epic over the use of generative AI denying a human actor the chance to voice the role (Jones' estate had already sold the rights to his voice to the Ukrainian tech company Respeecher in 2022 before his passing), but rumors recently swirled that the union dropped the charges in the wake of signing a new contract last month.

The legal outcome of Disney and Universal's lawsuit is still to be decided, but what is seemingly clear is that the potential AI takeover of Hollywood that has been feared with the proliferation of generative AI may not be as close as some people (and some companies) expect.

The bleachers filled with Fuji fans have every reason to jeer at the current state of cameras. While camera geeks sit on the sidelines, waiting for one of the most hyped cameras today—the Fujifilm X100VI—to return to store shelves, tariff woes are here to hit them with another punch in the gut. The camera made famous by TikTok stars and Instagram aficionados now costs $200 more than before in the U.S., making an already expensive camera even more pricey.

The entire X-series of cameras, including favorite mirrorless devices like the X-T5, X-T50, X-M5, all got price hikes as of Aug. 1. PetaPixel first reported on the price bump, though online camera retailer Moment confirmed all the new pricing details in a blog post published Friday. The new MSRP for the X100VI is $1,800, $200 more than previously. Other popular X-series cameras like the X-T50 went up from $1,400 to $1,600, and that's without any lens included in the box. Fujifilm's GFX lineup of professional cameras also saw price hikes between $500 and $800.

Moment said Fujifilm had indicated that anybody who was on backorder for their cameras would likely have to pay the new price. The retailer promised it would honor original pricing for anybody on backorder. Gizmodo reached out to Fujifilm for comment, and we will update this post if we hear back. Fujifilm is one of the last camera companies to increase prices since the start of this year. The hungry maw of Trump tariffs has already taken a big chunk out of supply chains, and last week President Donald Trump inked yet another trade deal with Japan (Fujifilm's home turf) that cut import taxes from 25% to 15%. Fujifilm also manufactures some of its cameras and components outside of Japan, so any levy reductions won't be a balm to all its recent wounds. Plus, the camera maker still has to make up the losses from dealing with the earlier tariffs for months on end.

The Fujifilm X100VI fixed-lens point-and-shoot manages to take beautiful shots even with relatively novice skills—mostly thanks to its detailed 40.2-megapixel shots and the inclusion of Fuji's film simulation filters. It was also an expensive hunk of glass and metal at $1,600 for a device with a singular 23mm lens. The price didn't stop the camera from selling out in the intervening months after launch last year. The ultra-hyped camera left most interested buyers on months-long preorder benders or stuck shopping around for used cameras, sometimes at prices well above the camera's MSRP. Don't believe me? Currently, the X100VI is listed on Amazon for well over $2,000.

The other option if you want the classic unibody design is to opt for the Fujifilm X-E5 mirrorless camera, which for all intents and purposes is an X100VI but with a swappable lens. The camera goes for $1,700 for the body by itself and costs $1,900 MSRP for the camera along with an XF23mm lens. Fujifilm's site still lists that camera as “out of stock.” Sites like B&H still list the camera as “up for preorder.” The X-E5 hasn't been listed as one of those impacted by the price hikes. The company's most recent design, the $850 X-Half half-frame camera, is also not on the list of cameras with price hikes. Fujifilm likely took tariffs into account with its more recent devices.

The other major camera makers, including Leica, Canon, Nikon, Sony, and Sigma, have all raised prices after tariffs went into effect in April. Fujifilm is just the latest to hike costs. The Japanese camera maker managed to stick it out longer than some, but the hike was inevitable. The worst part of this whole ordeal is that even if tariffs eventually go the way of the dodo, these cameras will never go back in price.

Remember VR? It's that thing where you put on a headset and… You remember VR, right? If you don't remember VR, you couldn't be blamed, because things have taken a turn since way back in 2023, and right now, VR seems to be on the back burner, cold, with the heat turned off, while its sister tech, XR/AR is front and center, getting all of chef's Michelin-starred attention.

That's not just a feeling, either; there are numbers to bear that trend out. Year over year, Meta said last week that Meta Reality Labs sales were down from $440 million in Q1 of 2024 to $412 million in Q1 of 2025. That drop, by Meta's own admission, is due in large part to tanking Quest sales. What makes that trend interesting isn't just the precipitous drop in Quest sales; it's the fact that at the same time, sales of its increasingly popular Ray-Ban smart glasses seem to be through the roof. According to Meta CFO Susan Li, Reality Labs' revenue loss was “due to lower Meta Quest sales, which were partially offset by increased sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses.” That increase in revenue, by the way, is apparently threefold year-over-year.

If I'm reading into Li's breakdown, Quest sales are tanking, and smart glasses are saving the day. Or, I guess that's one way to look at it. Another way to see that trend is that VR is skidding out, and smart glasses (and the potential for XR/AR inside them) are picking up the pieces. That may sound sensational, but it also makes perfect sense in other ways.

Don't get me wrong, I actually like VR/XR headsets; I think the Quest 3S is the perfect headset for the moment because it's light, affordable, and still offers a full-featured XR experience that will satisfy established XR/VR fans and impress beginners. That being said, they're still a burden. Strapping a headset to your face is inherently invasive and not exactly what most would call a pleasant time. Even the Quest 3, which is lightweight and generally comfortable compared to the competition, wears on your eyes, your face, and your poor, sweaty skin after a while.

As much as I love the Quest for what it could be, it's hard to reconcile that with what it is right now. Smart glasses, on the other hand, don't share those problems. Sure, Meta's Ray-Ban glasses don't do even half of what we want them to at this point in time—they don't even have a display in them yet—but they're a light touch. If you want a taste of smart features like Bluetooth audio, a voice assistant, and some (very hit-and-miss) AI, then you can snag a pair, slap them on your face, and wear them for hours without feeling like you're wearing anything other than a regular pair of glasses.

The lesson here is that it's better to do a little of what you would expect (enough to qualify as a good start) than try to do everything at the cost of a clunky form factor, and that's shining through when it comes to smart glasses versus VR headsets. Not only that, but smart glasses, though still very much a work in progress, are also potentially a lot more useful in your day-to-day. Because of their light form factor, you can actually bring them into the real world and use them for real stuff like taking pictures or calling your mom. Which is a reminder: you should call your mom, smart glasses or not.

No matter where your priorities or allegiances lie, the tides, as they often do in emerging tech, seem to be turning. On top of that, all of the latest rhetoric around smart glasses and XR/AR from Apple's Tim Cook and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg should give you some indication of which way those waters are flowing. If you're a fan of smart glasses, you've got nothing to worry about, but if you were excited to realize our full VR future, you may have to wait a while longer.

Good noise-cancelling headphones can be hard to find. Not every model out there offers the right mix of great sound, comfort, and battery life. Even when you do find one that checks most of these boxes, the price often creeps up to $200 or more. Thankfully, that changes today.

Right now, Amazon has dropped the price of the Sony WH-CH720N wireless noise-canceling headphones to just $97 in black, down from the usual $180. That's a hefty 46% discount. If black isn't your thing, the pink and white versions are also on sale for $98, just a dollar more. Regardless of the color, you're getting a solid pair from one of the most trusted brands out there, so act fast while you can.

See at Amazon

These headphones are Sony's lightest overhead wireless noise-canceling headphones yet. At just around 192g, they are easy to carry and wear for longer. The headband features a slimmer profile, while the earcups are designed to sit comfortably without feeling too tight. 

Sound quality is excellent, thanks to the Integrated Processor V1 and the digital sound enhancement engine. Everything from songs to dialogues comes through with clarity, and even older, lower-quality files sound more natural. Pair this with the dual noise sensor technology, and you will be able to fully immerse yourself in whatever you're listening to without any background distractions.

For when you do want to stay aware of your surroundings, the Ambient Sound mode with 20 adjustable levels gives you control over how much outside noise you let in. Calls get a boost, too. The precise voice pickup feature uses beamforming microphones to deliver your voice clearly, even with background chatter.

Of course, battery life is just as solid, as a full charge offers up to 35 hours of power. When you're in a hurry, a quick 3-minute charge gives you 60 minutes of playback. You can get through a few days without plugging them in. These headphones also support multipoint Bluetooth connection, so you can stay connected to two devices at once. Taking a phone call while watching something on your laptop? A single touch lets you switch between both quickly.

Overall, the WH-CH720N covers most of what people want in a good wireless headphone. They offer great value at their retail price of $180, but at $97, they're a steal. You're getting premium features are nearly half the cost, but don't wait too long, deals like this don't usually stick around.

Film Forum has released a trailer for Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass, the first stop-motion animated feature from the Quay Brothers in 20 years.

 

 

According to a report from FearHQ, the new Buffy the Vampire Slayer will indeed introduce a slayer named Nova who must stop a pair of vampires named Jack and Shirley from “raising a vampire army” on the grounds of New Sunnydale.

Nova, a 16-year-old bookworm, discovers she's a vampire Slayer in a rebuilt Sunnydale, split between gritty Old Sunnydale and upscale New Sunnydale. During Vampire Weekend, a festival celebrating the town's dark past, vampires Jack and Shirley emerge from a construction site, killing a teen and planning a ritual to raise a vampire army at the Cursed Circle.

Relatedly, Sarah Michelle Gellar has released a video of herself training with the incoming slayer, Ryan Kiera Armstrong, on Instagram.

Speaking of Buffy, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds showrunner Henry Alonso Myers told Entertainment Weekly he had “a bunch of conversations” with former Angel producer Jeffrey Bell on the logistics of filming with puppets in preparation for their own special episode. 

I had just socially a bunch of conversations with him about how they did it. That turned out to be not just a silly conversation but a very useful conversation.

Screen Rant reports Hannibal will now stream on Amazon Prime this August 30, rekindling rumors the series may have finally found a home for a potential fourth season adapting The Silence of the Lambs.

Finally, according to Ross Duffer on Instagram, the fifth season premiere of Stranger Things boasts “the craziest cold open” the show has “ever done.”

Chapters One and Two: locked, mixed, scored, colored, DONE. ‘The Crawl' is our favorite, most eventful first episode since Season 1. ‘The Vanishing of…' (yeah yeah you think you know who blah blah) has by far the craziest cold open we've ever done. One of the sequences we're most proud of this season.

HDMI and USB Type-C connected 6- and 13.3-inch displays use an open-source FPGA controller for zippy performance. Orders to be delivered in Q4 2025.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Modos Tech has announced that its fast and responsive e-Paper monitors for productivity users are now available for pre-order. The new displays are being provided in dev-kit form, touted as the “world's fastest open-hardware e-paper monitor.” Central to these claims are the shared performance figures, which indicate the Modos Paper Dev Kit display delivers refresh rates up to 75 Hz and sub-100 ms latency.

This e-paper endeavor has taken quite some time to get to this stage. We remember reporting on a Modus Paper project update back in May 2024.

Those monitor performance stats might be pedestrian in the colorful world of the best monitors, which, in the majority, use IPS and OLED tech. However, there are users out there who don't need to be distracted by color, and are wary of the eye-strain and fatigue that can stem from the use of backlit or emissive displays. In fact, some would prefer simple, efficient paper-like, sunlight readable displays – if it were not for the performance penalties that seem to be inherent to e-Ink and e-paper implementations so far.

“From writers and engineers to accessibility advocates and digital minimalists, people are tired of the distraction, eye strain, and fatigue of mainstream displays,” said Alexander Soto, CEO of Modos Tech. “E-paper offers a better path, and we've built tools that make it fast, flexible, and accessible to all.”

Modos thinks it has the answer to making e-paper acceptable for modern productivity, and it asserts it is largely down to its implementation of its own open-hardware reference designs.

Specifically, the Modos Paper Dev Kit displays pack the Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA, a DDR3 framebuffer, an STM32H750 microcontroller, and custom power-supply circuitry.

This open-hardware electronic design should prevent e-paper from being “held back by proprietary controllers and slow performance.” In short, users should be able to benefit from e-paper ergonomic niceties, without cliff-face drawbacks.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

So, what do you get with a Modos Paper Dev Kit? Whichever kit you pick, you will experience the aforementioned 75 Hz screen refresh rate and low latency performance.

Connectivity seems sufficient, with both HDMI and USB Type-C ports promised to offer plug & play on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It looks like the USB Type-C connection also delivers power, as expected. But if using this as an HDMI driven monitor, you will likely also need a power source of some kind attached to the USB Type-C port.

There are multiple screen modes supported by these monitor kits. Modus says that the devices offer “binary, 4-level, and 16-level grayscale, plus a hybrid mode that refines images dynamically.” Support for color e-paper displays is present in the design/architecture, but they aren't being marketed right now.

Those interested in acquiring one of these monitors can head on over to the project Crowd Supply. On that site, you will be choosing between a compact 6-inch, or more laptop-scale 13.3-inch kit.

There are two configurations, with rather disparate prices:



We often warn about crowdfunding campaigns, but note that Crowd Supply has a decent reputation for pushing projects to completion. It asserts that it is highly selective, looks for good plans to raise funds, and equally credible plans for manufacturing. Meanwhile, Crowd Supply handles fulfillment, media production, and more. Having said that, the platform admits “backing a product before it goes to market does entail some inherent risk. Delays, shortages, design problems, and other unforeseen issues can delay or prevent a project from getting to market.” So, take heed.

The FDA has approved VIZZ eye drops (LENZ Therapeutics, Inc.) for the treatment of presbyopia, the gradual loss of near vision associated with aging that affects nearly 130 million American adults.

The active ingredient in VIZZ 1.44% drops is aceclidine, an FDA approved product that contracts the sphincter of the iris, resulting in a pinhole effect that extends depth of focus to improve near vision without causing a myopic shift, according to the drug's manufacturer.

The FDA decision “represents a transformative improvement in the available treatment options for the 128 million adults living with blurry near vision in the United States,” said Eef Schimmelpennink, president and CEO of the company, in a statement.

The FDA approval followed the results of three randomized controlled phase 3 studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of VIZZ. CLARITY 1 and CLARITY 2 enrolled 466 participants who received a single daily dose for 42 days; CLARITY 3 included 217 people for a long-term safety analysis over a 6-month period, during which participants took a single daily dose of the eye drops.

VIZZ was associated with improvements in near vision within 30 minutes, and the effects lasted up to 10 hours, according to the company. The product was not linked to serious adverse events related to treatment. Common complaints among participants in the studies were instillation site irritation (20%), dim vision (16%), and headache (13%). Some participants also reported conjunctival hyperemia (8%) and ocular hyperemia (7%), LENZ said. 

“This FDA approval represents a disruptive paradigm shift in treatment options for millions of people who are frustrated and struggling with the inevitable age-related loss of their near vision,” said clinical investigator Marc Bloomenstein, OD, of the Schwartz Laser Eye Care Center in Scottsdale, Arizona, who helped conduct the research. “I believe this will be a welcome solution for both optometrists and ophthalmologists who will now be able to offer a highly effective and sought-after presbyopia treatment that could immediately become the standard of care, with a product profile that will meet our patients' needs.”

Cannabis use disorder (CUD) was associated with a greater than fivefold increased risk for benign tumors of major salivary glands compared to not having CUD, a new retrospective study showed. Additionally, the elevated risk persisted beyond 5 years of follow-up and particularly affected the parotid salivary gland.

“The elevated relative risk of benign parotid tumors and the persistent association over time highlight potential site-specific outcomes of cannabis use,” the investigators wrote.

“Future prospective research with large samples and data on cannabis doing, method of use, and benign salivary gland neoplasm pathology is required to further assess and confirm this association,” they added.

The study was led by Tyler J. Gallagher, MD, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles. It was published online on July 17 in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery.

The study was constrained by the absence of cannabis dosage information and histologic data on benign salivary gland tumors and a limited long-term follow-up.

The investigators reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Despite updated guidelines, peanut consumption among infants remained low; among toddlers, non-Hispanic White children displayed higher rates than any other age or racial/ethnic group. Egg intake varied by age and ethnicity, peaking among Mexican Americans while tree nut consumption increased sharply over time in children and adults.

“Public health campaigns should address caregiver fears and promote early introduction across all communities to reduce sensitization rates; however, based on our findings, these campaigns should account for differences in cultural and familial patterns of allergen consumption,” the authors of the study wrote. “Continued population-level surveillance is essential to monitor progress and ensure that interventions are equitable and effective in reducing the burden of food allergies in the US,” they added.

Erin A. Hosein, MS, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on July 28 in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice.

The reliance on two nonconsecutive 24-hour recalls, underestimation of allergen exposure by food-code methods, small sample sizes in COVID-era cycles, and restriction to three racial and ethnic groups may have limited generalizability.

The study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Some authors reported receiving consulting fees, grants, or royalties from various pharmaceutical companies. One author reported serving as an associate editor for The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

Mounting evidence points to a connection between dementia and common herpes virus infections, particularly herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which causes cold sores, and varicella zoster virus (VZV), the cause of chickenpox and shingles.

Multiple studies have shown that individuals with a history of these infections face a higher risk for dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). What was once a fringe hypothesis has gained traction, as a growing body of research points to these viruses as major factors in Alzheimer's and other dementias.

“There is now quite a lot of evidence obtained by a variety of methods which suggests that this virus is really a major factor in Alzheimer's disease. And the weight of the evidence supports a causal role,” Ruth Itzhaki, MSc, PhD, visiting professor, The Oxford Institute of Population Aging, Oxford, England, told Medscape Medical News.

Itzhaki was one of the first to hypothesize there was a potential connection between the herpes virus and AD and has spent much of her career investigating the link.

These pathogens may act as “under-recognized drivers of neurodegeneration. They can hide in the nervous system and reactivate later in life, each flare-up potentially inflicting cumulative damage that accelerates cognitive decline,” Shaheen Lakhan, MD, PhD, neurologist and researcher based in Miami told Medscape Medical News.

One early clue came decades ago, when Itzhaki and colleagues discovered HSV-1 DNA in the brains of patients with AD, most notably in carriers of the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE ε4) gene, a known genetic risk factor for the disease.

“The virus and the gene may be working in tandem — a synergy where a latent viral infection ‘flips the switch' on a genetic vulnerability,” Lakhan said.

Supporting a potential causal role, Itzhaki's team has since demonstrated that HSV-1 infection of cultured human neuronal cells induces the accumulation of amyloid-beta and phosphorylated tau — the primary components of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in AD. The treatment with antiviral agents significantly reduced both these pathological markers and cell death.

While research strongly suggests a link between certain herpes viruses and an increased risk for dementia, not all herpes viruses have been implicated.

HSV-1 and VZV have been more consistently linked to an increased risk for dementia, including AD. While some studies suggest a possible association with HSV-2 (genital herpes), the evidence is less conclusive than that for HSV-1 and VZV.

Other herpes viruses, like cytomegalovirus, have not shown a strong or consistent association with an increased dementia risk in most studies.

Research has also suggested that individuals with both HSV-1 and VZV infections may face an elevated, compounded risk. In one study, patients co-infected with HSV and VZV had a hazard ratio of 1.57 for developing dementia, whereas those with HSV-1 alone had a hazard ratio of 1.38 and those with VZV alone had a hazard ratio of 1.41.

Itzhaki explained that multiple biologically plausible mechanisms — supported by various studies — may explain the link between herpes virus infections and an increased risk for dementia.

For instance, herpes viruses can trigger chronic inflammation in the brain, a critical factor in neurodegeneration. Additionally, HSV-1 may promote amyloid plaque formation and influence tau phosphorylation, as previously noted.

The damage and risk occur as a result of reactivation of dormant HSV-1 in the brain after various types of damage, Itzhaki noted.

One recent study showed reactivation of dormant HSV-1 after mild brain injury or after cumulative general infections may drive neurodegenerative diseases by triggering pathological changes including accumulation of beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau.

“The notion that a virus many of us carry could be stoking neurodegeneration is provocative, but the science behind it is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. The past few years have delivered especially compelling data to support this viral link,” said Lakhan.

Some studies suggest antiviral medications used to treat herpes infections and vaccination against VZV could potentially reduce the dementia risk.

For example, one recent Taiwanese cohort study showed that symptomatic HSV-1 infection was associated with nearly a threefold increased risk of developing dementia. Antiherpetic medication reduced the risk by 90%.

However, a study of US veterans showed no link between HSV infection and increased dementia risk. Nonetheless, similar to the Taiwanese study, antiherpetic medication was associated with a protective effect against dementia.

Separately, in a matched case-control study of nearly 700,000 older adults, HSV-1 was more common in those with AD, and antiviral therapy for HSV-1 was associated with a lower risk of developing AD.

Yet in the VALAD clinical trial, valacyclovir therapy did not change the course of disease in older adults with early AD or mild cognitive impairment and antibodies revealing previous herpes infections — mainly HSV-1.

“Our trial suggests antivirals that target herpes are not effective in treating early Alzheimer's and cannot be recommended to treat such patients with evidence of prior HSV infection,” lead investigator, Davangere P. Devanand, MD, professor of psychiatry and neurology and director of Geriatric Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, in New York City, said in a news release.

“We do not know if long-term antiviral medication treatment following herpes infection can prevent Alzheimer's because prospective controlled trials have not been conducted,” Devanand said.

On the other hand, data suggest that vaccination against VZV may offer protection against cognitive decline.

In a landmark UK study that leveraged a unique vaccine rollout policy in Wales and analyzed health records of over 280,000 older adults, the receipt of the live-attenuated shingles vaccine was associated with approximately a 20% reduction in the risk of developing dementia over 7 years.

Lakhan said this study offers “one of the strongest pieces of evidence yet that preventing varicella-zoster reactivation (shingles) may translate into protecting the brain. In an era when we have few effective dementia preventives, the possibility that something as simple as a vaccine or antiviral could reduce risk by 20% or more is galvanizing.”

Lakhan believes “the herpes-dementia connection can no longer be dismissed as coincidence; it demands our attention and further investigation.”

He said physicians should be ready to address it in conversations with patients. “It's increasingly common for older patients, and their families, to ask, ‘Doc, I heard that cold sores or shingles might cause Alzheimer's — should I be worried?” Lakhan said.

The answer should be “balanced. We can't say herpes viruses cause Alzheimer's with absolute certainty, but we can say there's enough evidence to suggest they're contributing factors — and that taking steps to mitigate these infections is wise,” Lakhan said.

He added that he now routinely recommends the shingles vaccine to all eligible patients not only to prevent a painful rash but also as a potential investment in their long-term brain health. “There's little downside and plenty of upside to keeping these viruses at bay,” he added.

He also advised “prompt and aggressive” treatment of herpes outbreaks and prescribes antivirals for recurrent HSV-1 flares.

Some researchers, he said, are investigating whether chronic suppressive antiviral therapy might help delay dementia in high-risk individuals, though it's too early to recommend this as standard practice.

At present, Lakhan advises against prescribing daily antivirals solely for dementia prevention outside of clinical trials. However, for patients with frequent herpes reactivations or those who carry the APOE ε4 gene alongside a strong family history, he maintains a low threshold for treatment and emphasizes counseling on viral prevention.

Itzhaki noted that several surveys suggest antivirals may offer some protection against dementia. Taking antivirals in late middle age — when the immune system weakens — could be considered for individuals infected with HSV who also carry genetic risk factors.

Lakhan, said “the bottom line for practitioners is clear — encourage shingles vaccination, stay vigilant against chronic herpes infections, and consider that maintaining viral suppression might become part of our toolkit for preserving brain health.”

Itzhaki and Lakhan had no relevant disclosures.

DISCLOSURES August 04, 2025  



This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Technology was once again at the front and center of the recent American Diabetes Association (ADA) meetings. Now, I'm not going to go through all of the details of all that was presented, but I think we should all be proud, as part of the diabetes community, in terms of where we've come and where we're going because our ability to use technology and help our patients has really made a difference. 

In many studies that were presented — and many of them were real-world data with all sorts of different automated insulin delivery (AID) systems and such — we really saw improvements in outcomes. I think this further cements our recommendations that these kinds of tools should be used in people with type 1 diabetes and insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes.

My sadness to much of this is the difficulty in getting some of these devices for underresourced patients and the fact that, to some degree, technology does worsen some of the divide between those who are well-served and those who are underserved. I know these tools can be used to help everybody, and I think that regardless of socioeconomic status we can use these, but we need to be sure to use them in the appropriate context with the appropriate support. 

Suffice it to say that almost any system you want to look up was discussed, and pretty much all systems provide benefit in our patients with diabetes. It's true for patients with type 2 diabetes who are and aren't on insulin, as well as people who take insulin.

There were even interesting abstracts about people who don't have diabetes yet, who have prediabetes, who are using the devices that they can get over the counter. This is a field that's evolving, and at each ADA meeting, there are even more interesting bits of data that you can learn as you go through the meeting.

In addition to data on AID systems, there were data on continuous glucose monitoring use in a wide variety of settings, which included people with type 2 diabetes who weren't on insulin, people with prediabetes, and even people using the over-the-counter systems. We have much to learn from all the data that are being aggregated. It makes me happy because I've been such a fan of diabetes technology since it came on the market, and I think it's really spread out to help many people. 

The downside to this is that there are many people who don't have access to these expensive tools, and I think there's a large amount of effort that's been made both by the ADA and others to expand access. I think it's important that people recognize that we want to provide access to the tools that people need to appropriately manage their diabetes no matter what their socioeconomic status. 

Now, in terms of one specific device, I'm going to discuss the twiist system (Sequel Med Tech). The reason I'm discussing this is because it's just about to come on that market. It's a pump that's actually a circle, and it's called “twiist” because it twists. It's different from other pump systems. It's designed by Dean Kamen, who is the man who designed the first Medtronic pumps, and it's got some interesting features. 

First of all, it uses the Loop algorithm. This is the do-it-yourself algorithm that was developed a while ago that has many features, including the fact that it's got a large amount of adjustability so you can set varying targets. I think it's a pretty good algorithm.

I haven't used it with this pump yet, but my feeling is that embedded in the pump and used as an AID system, it's going to be very helpful. 

This pump also has an occlusion alert so that if there's an occlusion to the insulin delivery, it's going to make noise so that patients are alerted to this. It worries me a little bit because I think patients get occlusions all the time — like they sit funny and the catheter kinks or something. I think that for really bad occlusion issues, where people's glucose levels start to go to the 300s and 400s and they have to do troubleshooting, this might alert people in advance before they become very hyperglycemic so they can change out the infusion set.

I think it's an interesting concept, this occlusion alarm. I think it's interesting that this pump uses the Loop algorithm, which is now FDA approved. It's a different pump in that it is physically different. It is a tethered pump, but I think that our patients are going to find this interesting and we're going to need to see how they like it because I can never tell for sure what I think about something until my patients tell me.

It does work with the FreeStyle Libre 3 Plus, and that's what it's going to be launched with in terms of the sensor. It will also work with the Eversense 1-year implantable sensor within the next several months. Eventually, it will also integrate with the Abbott dual glucose ketone sensor. I think there are going to be many interesting different ways in which to use this, and we'll see what patients think and how it worked.

They did present data from two trials. One, a small investigator-led study, and one, some real-world data, which showed that the pump was effective and there were improvements in time in range without a significant increase in time below range. 

This sounds promising. I love that my patients have more options, and we'll see what happens as our patients begin to use it and give us feedback.

Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who responded inadequately to sitagliptin plus metformin experienced improvements in glycemic control and insulin sensitivity after lobeglitazone was added to their regimen.

“The observed improvements in various glucose-related metabolic factors and lipid metabolism indicators with lobeglitazone coadministration may provide valuable evidence for long-term blood glucose management and cardiovascular risk reduction,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Eun-Gyoung Hong, MD, Hallym University Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital, Hwaseong, South Korea. It was published online in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.

A longer follow-up might be needed to fully evaluate the sustained effects of the study outcomes and potential side effects.

Osteoporosis was prevalent in 41% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Factors such as lupus nephritis classes III and IV, U1-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies, and longer disease duration were associated with lower areal bone mineral density (BMD), and active lupus nephritis was associated with osteoporosis.

""The identification of SLE-specific risk factors allows us to recognize patients at particular high risk for OP [osteoporosis]. This prompts us to suggest a thorough osteoporosis check-up in patients with high CRP [C-reactive protein], LN [lupus nephritis], or U1-RNP-antibodies,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Edgar Wiebe, Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Charitéplatz 1, Berlin, Germany. It was published online on July 28, 2025, in Arthritis Research & Therapy.

This monocentric cohort study primarily involved White Caucasians, thereby limiting the generalisability of the findings to other patient groups. A potential selection bias may have resulted in overrepresentation of patients with more severe disease courses who were at a high risk for osteoporosis. The cross-sectional design limited the ability to establish causality between identified factors and outcomes.

Open access funding was enabled and organised by Projekt DEAL. The prospective observational study received a joint funding from AbbVie, Amgen, Alfasigma, Almirall, Biogen, BMS, Chugai, Fresenius Kabi, Galapagos, GA Generic Assays, GSK, Hexal, Horizon Therapeutics, Lilly, Medac, Mundipharma, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi-Genzyme, and UCB.

Higher exposure to particulate matter with a diameter < 2.5 µm (PM2.5) was associated with a significantly increased risk for incident systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) among Taiwanese adults.

“[The] findings suggest that it is imperative to implement effective public policies aimed at improving air quality to reduce the incidence of SLE,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Yun-Ju Lai, MD, PhD, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. It was published online on July 20, 2025, in Lupus Science & Medicine.

The status of genes associated with SLE susceptibility was not known. Data on income levels or environmental risk factors linked to SLE, such as exposure to crystalline silica, were unavailable. Reliance on registry data rather than clinical assessment may have reduced the diagnostic accuracy. All participants were from Taiwan, thereby affecting the generalizability of the findings.

This study was supported by grants from the Department of Health, Taipei City Government. The authors declared having no competing interests.

Not getting enough sleep and going to bed late were associated with a higher risk for central precocious puberty, particularly in girls. Girls with this condition often had serious sleep issues 3.5 years before puberty began.

TAKEAWAY:

“Insufficient sleep and late bedtime may be critical determinants of CPP [central precocious puberty]. Due to their modifiable nature, we recommend that girls maintain sufficient sleep duration and adhere to earlier sleep times, particularly before puberty,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Wen-Yu Lin, MD, of the Department of Family Medicine at the Taipei Medical University Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. It was published online on July 18, 2025, in the Journal of Adolescent Health.

The recruitment of participants from urban hospitals may have introduced selection bias. Participants were from families with higher incomes and educational levels, which may not represent the general Asian population. The follow-up period for normally developing boys was not long enough to fully understand the relationship between sleep duration and pubertal development.

Eight essential nutrients make up the suite of B vitamins also known as the B complex. Researchers from Tufts University and elsewhere have revealed that these B vitamins influence a vast spectrum of human health and disease, including cognitive function, cardiovascular health, gastric bypass recovery, neural tube defects, and even cancer.

""It's hard to study the B vitamins in isolation,"" says gastroenterologist Joel Mason, senior scientist at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) and professor at the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy and Tufts University School of Medicine. ""Four of these B-vitamins cooperate as co-factors in many critical activities in cells in what we call 'one carbon metabolism'.""

One carbon metabolism is a series of pathways that allow for the transfer of single-carbon units to cells for essential processes such as DNA synthesis, amino acid metabolism, and more. It's their role in all these crucial biological functions that make the B vitamins so important-and so challenging to tease out how they contribute positively and, perhaps negatively, to human health.

Mason and two additional researchers who spent their careers studying one or more of the B vitamins explain what we currently know about how the five of the most prominently researched B vitamins impact or improve cognitive as well as cardiovascular health.

One of the most active areas for B vitamin research is cognitive health. By the age of 75-80, 40% of people have a diminished ability to absorb food-bound B12, says Mason. This deficiency leads to a decline in nerve health, particularly in the spine and brain, which can contribute to the risk of developing dementia in older adults. 

For decades, clinicians and researchers thought measuring plasma B12 was accurate enough to determine if supplementation was needed. However, Mason says, while many elderly people may have B12 levels that are in the 'low to normal' range, they are simultaneously developing neurological deficits linked to vitamin B12 deficiency. 

The contribution of vitamin B12 deficiency to cognitive decline and the vascular disease that results in many cases of dementia is under-diagnosed and under-reported.""

Irwin H. Rosenberg, Jean Mayer University Professor Emeritus, Tufts University

Rosenberg is also a former dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy who also taught pharmacology at the School of Medicine. 

""Age-related cognitive decline is not just Alzheimer's,"" says Rosenberg. ""We've lumped together many kinds of brain dysfunction under one name. And in doing so, we've overlooked how critical blood vessels-and by extension, nutrition-are to preserving brain function.""

The pathology of Alzheimer's disease described the abnormal buildup of two proteins in the brain-amyloid and tau-which clump together, forming plaques and tangles which are believed to disrupt brain cell function. 

Yet Rosenberg says cerebrovascular disease and small vessel disease, which in some cases are connected to B vitamin deficiency, is more prevalent with cognitive decline and dementia than the buildup of harmful proteins in the brain, which has been the focus of so much research and drug development to treat Alzheimer's disease. Treating people with drugs meant to address the protein buildup will not work if the cause of dementia symptoms is a B12 deficiency.

Testing to identify whether cognitive decline and dementia symptoms may be caused by a B12 deficiency is therefore imperative, he says.

""B12 tests measure all B12 in your system, even though approximately 80% is inactive,"" says Paul Jacques, senior scientist at the HNRCA and professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy.

To pinpoint a B12 deficiency requires two additional tests. One, called the MMA test, measures levels of methymalonic acid, an acid produced during certain aspects of metabolism requiring adequate B12. ""It can be elevated with even a mild B12 deficiency, indicating a potential higher risk of dementia,"" says Jacques.

A second test measures levels of an amino acid, homocysteine, which is also a byproduct of metabolism requiring B12. If only homocysteine levels are elevated, a folate deficiency may be the problem. If both MMA and homocysteine are high, a B12 deficiency is the likely culprit.

If a patient presents with neurological issues or signs of dementia, conducting all three tests will narrow down if a B vitamin deficiency is involved-and which B vitamin it is.

""Unlike changes that we are unable to see in patients being given expensive anti-amyloid antibody drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease, there is actually evidence that fairly early in the course of cognitive decline we can slow the process if the underlying cause is elevated homocysteine or B12-related deficiency,"" says Rosenberg. ""It's my recommendation that patients, with or without anemia, should be screened for elevated homocysteine or B12 deficiency because that may be one of the reversible factors in their cognitive decline.""

This isn't a new theory. Two decades ago, studies like the Framingham Heart Study showed that elevated homocysteine predicted brain atrophy and a higher risk of dementia. More recently, trials such as VITACOG and FACT have shown that B vitamin supplementation can slow brain shrinkage and improve cognitive performance in those at risk.

""There is an enormous amount of education needed around this issue,"" Rosenberg says. ""We hope to convince cardiologists, neurologists, and internists to measure B12 and homocysteine levels as part of the evaluation of cognitive impairment. Even the modest effects from vitamins that cost pennies a day can be very meaningful in those who will benefit, especially when you compare vitamin supplementation to costly drugs that are getting much more attention yet may have the same or even less benefit.""

Jacques and colleagues currently are leading a study using data from about 2,500 middle-aged and older adults in the Framingham Heart Study, all of whom were free of dementia in the 1990s and all of whom received B12, MMA, and homocysteine testing for the last 20+ years.

""The risk of dementia and late-stage Alzheimer's begins to increase when one is 75 years old or older, but evidence suggests that some of the pathological changes associated with dementia and Alzheimer's may start to develop 20+ years before clinical symptoms and diagnosis occurs,"" says Jacques. ""This study should give us a good handle on whether B12 is related to cognitive decline and dementia. If so, hopefully we can identify a simple, inexpensive intervention that could be started years in advance and before real damage occurs.""

Jacques is also looking at the role folate (B9) may play in the development of cognitive issues, specifically the influence high levels of folate might have on B12 and cognitive health.

In the 1950s, people with anemia were treated with folic acid, the synthetic form of folate. Unfortunately, it became clear that while pharmaceutical level treatment with folic acid alleviated anemia, it often masked or exacerbated B12 deficiency. ""Scientists observed that people with low B12 and high folic acid concentrations tended to have cognitive issues,"" Jacques says.

More recent research suggested that it wasn't total B12 concentrations that folic acid might be affecting, but perhaps just one component, holoTC, which is the form of vitamin B12 that is crucial for transporting and using B12 in cells and is considered a potentially better indicator of vitamin B12 status. 

Jacques and colleagues are conducting two studies to tease apart the issues involved. ""In the first, our B vitamin and brain aging study, we will look at the influence high folate status has on the relationships between B12 and cognitive health. A second study we are doing in collaboration with Rutgers will look at the effect of high folic acid in the blood on the two forms of B12 -holoTC and unbound cobalamin.""

B vitamins have also stirred excitement among researchers because of their possible role in heart disease and stroke prevention, but thus far their utility as a clinical treatment remains limited.

Scientists discovered in the early 2000s that riboflavin (B2) could decrease blood pressure very effectively. It is believed that riboflavin improves a biochemical reaction mediated by a gene called MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) that helps the body use folate. Riboflavin is only effective in reducing blood pressure specifically in patients with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype, however.

Vitamins B6, B12, and folate help the body rid itself of homocysteine, which in overabundance had been linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, as well as dementia. However, a number of clinical trials in the 1980s showed that B6, B12, and folate supplementation didn't decrease heart attacks, but did slightly lower the risk of strokes.

Niacin (B3) can lower LDL (the so-called ""bad cholesterol"") and raise HDL (the so-called ""good cholesterol""). ""But it has to be taken in such large doses that it often causes very uncomfortable flushing, like hot flashes,"" says Mason. ""People often can't tolerate taking it, and other drug options are available that lower blood LDL that do not have such unpleasant side effects.""

Perhaps most promising for the future is the role vitamin B6 may play in curbing inflammation, which has been identified as an underlying feature of many chronic diseases, from heart disease to diabetes to arthritis to dementia.

A number of animal studies, plus some human studies, suggest that supplemental B6 can reduce inflammation. ""Again, we are talking about giving B vitamins at an appropriate pharmaceutical level under the care of a clinician,"" cautions Mason. ""B6 can be toxic in large amounts."" He sees this research as an area to watch in the years ahead.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine say they unexpectedly found new information about a protein's special role in getting brain cells to communicate at the right time and place in experiments with genetically engineered mice.

The finding about the protein intersectin, they say, advances scientific understanding of a key process in how the mammalian brain forms memories and learns, and may help advance treatments for cognitive disorders including Down syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease.

A report of the new findings, funded in part by the National Institutes of Health, was published July 8 in the journal Nature Neuroscience. 

Specifically, the researchers found that intersectin keeps tiny, message-carrying bubbles inside brain cells in a particular location until they are ready to be released to activate a neighboring brain cell. The protein does so by creating a physical boundary between these bubbles, similar to how oil separates from water.

Message transfer from brain cell to brain cell is key to information processing, learning and forming memories. The bubbles, synaptic vesicles, are housed within the synapse - the connection point where brain cells communicate.

In typical synapses within the brains of mammals, 300 synaptic vesicles are clustered together in the intersection between any two brain cells, but only a few of these vesicles are used for such message transfer, researchers say. Pinpointing how a synapse knows which vesicles to use has long been a target of research by those who study the biology and chemistry of thought.

We found that these tiny bubbles have a distinct domain where they want to be. Keeping them at particular locations within a synapse enables the brain to decide how and when to use them while thinking and processing information.""

Shigeki Watanabe, PhD, Study Lead and Associate Professor, Cell Biology, Johns Hopkins Medicine

In an effort to better understand the operation of these synaptic vesicles, Watanabe and his team designed a study that first focused on endocytosis, a process in which brain cells recycle synaptic vesicles after they are used for neuronal communication.

Already aware of intersectin's general role in endocytosis and neuronal communication, the scientists genetically engineered mice to lack the gene that codes for intersectin. However, and somewhat to their surprise, Watanabe says removing the protein did not appear to halt endocytosis in brain cells.

The research team refocused their experiments, taking a closer look at the synaptic vesicles themselves.

Using a high-resolution fluorescence microscope to observe where intersectin is in a synapse, the researchers found it in between vesicles that are used for neuronal communication and those that are not, as if they are physically separating the two.

To further understand the role of intersectin at this location, they used an electron microscope to visualize synaptic vesicles in action across one billionth of a meter. In all the nerve cells from mice lacking this protein, the scientists say synaptic vesicles close to the membrane were absent from the release zone of the synapse, the place where the bubbles would discharge to nearby neurons.

""This suggested that intersectin regulates release, rather than recycling, of these vesicles at this location of the synapse,"" says Watanabe.

Using a technique called zap and freeze microscopy, the scientists stimulated neurons in the brains of mice to capture the movement of synaptic vesicles on a millisecond timescale and at a nanometer resolution.

In normal mice, the scientists saw vesicles fusing with the brain cell membrane within a millisecond after stimulation. Then, new synaptic vesicles came and filled the vacated release sites of the synapse within about 15 milliseconds.

In two genetically engineered lines of mice, one lacking intersectin and another lacking the endophilin protein, which binds to intersectin, new vesicles could not be recruited to the vacated release sites. Similarly, vesicles within nerve cells of mice with mutations that blocked the interaction of these two proteins also slowed the local replenishment of synaptic vesicles that carry information from neuron to neuron.

""When information is processed in the brain, this replenishment process needs to happen in just a few milliseconds,"" says Watanabe. ""When you don't have vesicles staged and ready to go at the release sites or the active zones, then neurotransmission cannot continue.""

In future research, the scientists say they aim to better understand how intersectin shuttles new synaptic vesicles to release sites.

The Lancet: Plastic pollution is an underrecognized threat to health, experts warn as they launch a project to track plastics' health impacts and monitor progress.

Ahead of the expected finalisation of an UN global plastics treaty, a group of international experts call for a greater focus on health impacts when considering plastic pollution. The Health Policy published in The Lancet reviews the current evidence on how plastics – including microplastics and plastic chemicals - impact health and announces the launch of a new project tracking these impacts: the Lancet Countdown on Health and Plastics.

It is projected that, without changes, plastic production will almost triple between 2019 and 2060 [2]. The Health Policy discusses evidence that plastics endanger human health at every stage of their life cycle – in production, use, and disposal – and highlights:

Based on the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change, the Lancet Countdown on Health and Plastics will identify and track a series of indicators that document the impacts of plastics and plastic chemicals on human health across all stages of the plastic life cycle. The first indicator report is expected in mid-2026.

McGill University researchers have developed and are licensing a digital tool to help safely reduce patients' use of medications that may be unnecessary or even harmful to them.

When clinicians review a patient's file, MedSafer flags potentially inappropriate medications. In a new clinical trial, the software helped deprescribe such medications in 36 per cent of long-term care residents, nearly triple as many as when reviews were done without the tool.

Sometimes we blame aging for memory loss or mobility issues when the real culprit is the medications. I've seen patients go from barely responsive to having conversations again after stopping a sedating medication.""

Dr. Emily McDonald, Lead Author, Associate Professor in McGill's Department of Medicine, Scientist at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (The Institute) and attending physician at the McGill University Health Centre

Nearly two thirds of Canadian seniors take five or more medications a day, and the number is significantly higher in long-term care, she added.

Medications are typically reviewed every three months in long-term care homes, but the scholars say there's no standard approach to deprescribing.

MedSafer works as a checklist for clinicians. It scans a resident's medication list alongside their health conditions, flags drugs that may no longer be appropriate and provides guidance on how to stop some medications or for safer alternatives.

The software was co-developed by McDonald and Dr. Todd Lee, Associate Professor in McGill's Department of Medicine and Scientist at The Institute . The trial involved 725 residents in five long-term care homes in New Brunswick who were taking an average of 10 medications each.

Medications often accumulate over time and are sometimes prescribed to counteract the side effects of other drugs, a pattern known as a ""prescribing cascade.""

""Some medications can increase the risk of falls, confusion and hospitalizations,"" said Lee. ""The more you take, the more side effects and interactions you can have.""

The researchers' goal is to see MedSafer integrated into primary care, so that overmedication can be addressed before patients enter long-term care.

""This should be the new standard of care for older adults,"" McDonald said. ""No one should be on a medication that's doing more harm than good.""

""Electronic Decision Support for Deprescribing in Older Adults Living in Long-Term Care"" by Emily McDonald and Todd Lee et al. was published in JAMA Network Open.

The research was funded by the Healthy Seniors Pilot Project, a joint initiative of the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Government of New Brunswick.

McDonald and Lee are co-founders of MedSafer Corp., which licenses the software used in the study.

A daily bowl of custom granola could lift your mood and reshape your gut, if it matches your microbes.

Study: Effectiveness of personalized granola tailored to the gut microbiota for improving gut environment and mood states. Image credit: Katarzyna Hurova/Shutterstock.com

A recent study in Frontiers in Microbiology evaluated the impact of personalized granola on an individual's gut microbiota and mood states. Personalized granola tended to increase the production of some short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and some improved mood indicators, suggesting that tailored dietary interventions may optimize health outcomes.

The gut microbiota produces SCFAs that influence multiple physiological processes, including endocrine signaling, intestinal immunity, and neural function. Low SCFA production could lead to hypertension, obesity, and many other diseases. Research has shown that prebiotics (e.g., inulin) significantly influence gut microbiota composition and SCFA production.

Granola is rich in dietary fiber and a mixture of oats, rye, and other grains. Due to its high fiber content, it is believed to influence gut microbiota composition. Granola consumption has been linked to improved bowel movements, influences gut microbiota, and lowers blood pressure in hemodialysis patients. Research has shown that granola consumption can lead to increased Bifidobacterium, which is associated with improved mood, lower perceived stress, and lower subjective sleepiness.

The gut microbiota composition varies across individuals, highlighting the importance of precision and personalized nutrition. Personalizing dietary interventions may help improve risk factors for type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, only a few studies have explored the administration of prebiotics tailored to an individual's gut microbiota.

The current study identified gut bacteria that promote SCFA production by actively metabolizing specific prebiotics and devised personalized granola (BodyGranola®, Calbee, Inc.) based on this information. The goal was to assess the efficacy of personalized granola, hypothesizing that it would significantly enhance the production of SCFAs and other metabolites. The impact on mental health indicators and stool frequency was also evaluated.

A single-blind, single-arm, pre- and post-study was conducted using a sample of 99 individuals. The study involved tailoring granola to each individual's gut microbiota composition by incorporating three prebiotic ingredients from six options: galacto-oligosaccharide, barley, fructo-oligosaccharide, inulin, resistant starch, and Hi-Cacao.

For 8 weeks, individuals consumed 50 g of granola daily. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods were used to analyze gut microbiota and intestinal metabolites. To do so, fecal samples were collected at baseline and at the 4-week and 8-week time points. Defecation questionnaires, the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), and the Profile of Mood States Second Edition (POMS2) were used to evaluate defecation and mood.

Overall, the levels of organic acids, excluding the main SCFAs, increased post consumption of personalized granola, regardless of gut microbiota type, between baseline and week 8. The results showed that acetic acid levels showed an upward trend, and caproic acid increased significantly between the baseline and week 8. The opposite was noted for formic acid. The levels of caproic acid showed marked differences between the baseline and week 4, as well as between the baseline and week 8. Lactic acid levels exhibited an increasing trend, while succinic acid levels increased significantly.

The type of organic acid produced depended on the type of gut microbiota. For example, caproic, lactic, and succinic acid increased significantly in the BaBiBl type. Furthermore, caproic acid, butyric acid, and 2-methylvaleric acid increased in the BaBiF type.

Consuming personalized granola did not significantly alter the overall composition of the gut microbiota. Bifidobacterium increased, while Faecalibacterium and Bacteroides tended to decrease, and no significant changes were observed in Blautia. A significant reduction in Chao1 and Shannon diversity indices was noted, although this may reflect changes in relative abundance rather than an actual loss of diversity.

The POMS2 assessment revealed improvements in vigor-activity (VA) and total mood disturbance scores, while AIS showed no significant changes. The scores for bloating and gas worsened, while stool volume increased significantly.

The disturbances in physical and mental states depended on the type of gut microbiota. For example, VA significantly improved between baseline and week 4, and insomnia disturbance significantly improved between baseline and week 8, in the BaBiBl type.

Furthermore, the VA in the BaFBl type improved substantially between baseline and week 8, and in the BaBiF type, between baseline and week 4; anger-hostility significantly improved. All microbiota types showed a marked increase in stool volume, except BaPF. All types except BaBiBl showed a substantial increase in gas accumulation.

The results showed that personalized granola can enhance metabolite production, promote beneficial bacterial growth, and improve specific physiological and psychological outcomes depending on the microbiota type. A key limitation of the study is its consideration of only six bacterial genera and their corresponding prebiotic toppings. However, there is no strict one-to-one relationship between prebiotics and gut bacteria, and the matching was based on previous literature rather than functional validation. Furthermore, a broader range of ingredients could be explored to select prebiotic toppings.

Another limitation concerns using a single group for pre- and post-comparison, which does not fully account for potential placebo effects. The absence of a control group consuming either base granola or mismatched prebiotics made it challenging to identify whether the observed effects were driven by the specific prebiotics or the base granola itself. Dietary intake during the study was also not standardized, and some participants consumed probiotic foods, introducing potential confounding effects.

Lastly, while personalised granola may offer health benefits, the frequency of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms was notable, with over two-thirds of participants reporting increased gas. This suggests that high intake of fermentable prebiotic fibers, particularly inulin, may lead to discomfort in some individuals.

Scientists uncover how low-dose metformin targets brain pathways to lower blood sugar, opening fresh avenues for safer and smarter diabetes therapies.

Study: Low-dose metformin requires brain Rap1 for its antidiabetic action. Image Credit: Kateryna Kon / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers tested whether low, clinically relevant doses of metformin lower blood glucose via inhibition of Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1) in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) of the brain.

Classic models place metformin's action in the liver through adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but newer work adds adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) signaling, mitochondrial targets, and even gut-mediated effects, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). The central nervous system tightly regulates glucose through hypothalamic circuits, so even small drug signals in the brain can shift whole-body metabolism.

There remains uncertainty about the relative importance of these pathways at clinically relevant metformin doses. Could low doses of metformin work by a neural route? The current study addresses this question and highlights the need for further research to dissect brain-to-organ pathways.

When researchers measured metformin inside the brain, they found therapeutic doses produced hypothalamic concentrations around 4.4 μM – perfectly aligning with the levels needed to activate VMH SF1 neurons

The researchers used mice to test a brain-based pathway. They compared normal littermates with Rap1ΔCNS mice, a forebrain-specific Rap1 knockout generated by deleting Rap1a and Rap1b in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKIIα)-expressing neurons. All mice were given a high-fat diet to raise blood sugar (hyperglycemia). They received single or repeated intraperitoneal doses of antidiabetic agents like metformin (a biguanide), rosiglitazone (a thiazolidinedione), exendin-4 (a GLP-1 receptor agonist), glibenclamide (a sulfonylurea), dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor), and insulin, with blood glucose tracked over time. Dose-response testing used metformin at 50–150 mg/kg and glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) with area under the curve (AUC) analysis.

To probe central action, metformin was delivered by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection (1–30 μg) to diet-induced obese mice, with food-intake controls and body-weight monitoring. Electrophysiology in hypothalamic slices assessed how metformin alters the firing of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) neurons in the VMH. Gain-of-function experiments expressed constitutively active Rap1 (Rap1V12) using adeno-associated virus (AAV) in VMH or a Rosa26-lox-stop-lox (LSL)-Rap1V12 × CaMKIIα-Cre cross to elevate CNS Rap1 activity. Outcomes included blood glucose, glucose tolerance, and c-Fos mapping of neuronal activation.

Deleting Rap1 in forebrain neurons produced a selective defect in metformin responsiveness. In littermate controls, metformin lowered glycemia, but Rap1ΔCNS mice did not show significant glucose reductions to metformin despite normal responses to other antidiabetic agents. Thus, global glucose-lowering capacity was intact, yet metformin's effect was specifically lost when brain Rap1 was absent.

Surprisingly, rosiglitazone lowered blood glucose just as effectively as metformin in control mice, yet only metformin's effect vanished when brain Rap1 was missing.

Dose-response studies sharpened this selectivity. At 50–150 mg/kg, metformin reduced blood glucose in controls in a dose-dependent fashion (quantified by AUC), but the same doses failed in Rap1ΔCNS mice. GTTs showed that low-dose metformin improved tolerance in controls, whereas Rap1ΔCNS mice gained this benefit only at suprapharmacologic exposures (≥200 mg/kg), implying that high concentrations can bypass the brain pathway. This highlights that the requirement for brain Rap1 is specific to low, clinically relevant doses of metformin, while higher, less clinically relevant doses likely act through peripheral mechanisms.

Directly targeting the brain confirmed sufficiency. ICV metformin (as low as 1–10 μg) acutely lowered blood glucose in diet-induced obese mice and in leptin-deficient (ob/ob) and streptozotocin-treated models, independent of food intake and without weight loss, indicating a centrally mediated glycemic effect at tiny doses compared with systemic delivery.

c-Fos mapping localized metformin-responsive neurons to the VMH. Electrophysiology showed that metformin depolarized VMH SF1 neurons and increased firing; this response was largely abolished when Rap1 was removed from SF1 neurons, implicating a Rap1-dependent VMH node as the metformin target.

Gain- and loss-of-function genetics further cemented causality. In Rap1CNSV12 mice (constitutively active Rap1 in forebrain), fasting glycemia and intolerance were higher, and metformin no longer improved glucose excursions during GTTs. Similarly, forcing Rap1V12 expression bilaterally in VMH using AAV blunted both acute and chronic glucose-lowering by metformin and markedly impaired metformin-induced improvements in glucose tolerance. Conversely, deleting Rap1 specifically in SF1 neurons lowered glycemia to the same degree as metformin and eliminated any additional acute or chronic effect of the drug. Together, these manipulations show that metformin's therapeutic effect requires Rap1 inhibition within VMH SF1 neurons.

Pharmacological context matters, as brain and cerebrospinal fluid metformin concentrations at therapeutic dosing are ~0.5–10 micromolar, far below hepatic or intestinal levels. In this range, metformin activated SF1 neurons and reduced Rap1 activity, consistent with a highly sensitive central mechanism that dominates at low doses, while higher, less clinical doses likely recruit peripheral pathways and can bypass the CNS Rap1 requirement. The study does not exclude the possibility of direct effects of metformin on peripheral tissues such as the liver and intestine at higher doses.

Even when given orally – the standard clinical route – a low dose (150 mg/kg) improved glucose tolerance in normal mice but had no effect in those lacking brain Rap1.

In mice lacking neural Rap1, baseline blood glucose is often reduced, which may limit the observable effect of further metformin administration (""floor effect""). However, even in glycaemia-matched groups, metformin failed to lower glucose in Rap1ΔCNS mice but remained effective in controls.

The study also points to the potential involvement of other regulators, such as exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2), in activating Rap1 in the brain, as well as possible connections to the lysosomal AMPK pathway. While this was not directly tested in this study, it represents a promising avenue for future research.

To summarize, this study identifies a brain-first mechanism for metformin at therapeutic exposure: low doses inhibit Rap1 in VMH SF1 neurons to lower blood glucose. The effect is selective for metformin among United States Food and Drug Administration-approved agents and is lost when CNS Rap1 is deleted or constitutively activated, but restored at very high, less clinically relevant doses that likely act peripherally. While the findings highlight the importance of the VMH Rap1 pathway at low, clinically relevant doses, they do not rule out peripheral mechanisms at higher doses or in other contexts. For patients and clinicians, this brain pathway helps explain why modest doses work safely and consistently, and it points to central Rap1 signaling as a target to refine diabetes therapies that coordinate liver, muscle, and gut.

A 12-year study of over 100,000 adults reveals that your grocery shop may be increasing your risk of lung cancer, even if you've never smoked. 

Study: Association between ultra-processed food consumption and lung cancer risk: a population-based cohort study. Image credit: Arinau20/Shutterstock.com

While ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are widely thought of as unhealthy, their association with lung cancer has not been validated so far. A recent study published in Thorax examined whether lung cancer risk was increased in people who ate more UPF. This study looked at overall lung cancer rates and two cancer types, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

UPFs are becoming increasingly widely adopted as a major part of the diet globally. This trend shows no signs of decreasing, even though UPF intake correlates with increased risks of death, cancer, irritable bowel disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and hypertension.

Lung cancer is a leading cause of death, with 2.2 million new cases being reported each year, and 1.8 million deaths worldwide. It remains latent for years or decades before manifesting itself clinically. These aspects lend urgency to early diagnostic and preventive efforts.

Cigarette smoking is a primary risk factor for lung cancer, but diet also plays an important role. UPFs are easily accessible, extremely delicious with addictive tastes, and very convenient as they avoid the mess and time involved in cooking. They also cost less than whole foods and have a long shelf life.

Conversely, they are non-nutritious and calorie-dense. UPF is made from food ingredients extracted or synthesized chemically or by highly processed food components. It is deficient in micronutrients, including vitamins and minerals, but high in sugars and salts, and a host of additives not found in home-cooked foods.

Unfortunately, UPF is “designed to replace all other food groups with attractive packaging and intensive marketing,” according to the authors. This flies in the face of its known association with metabolic and cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and death. It may not be coincidental that these conditions have increased in prevalence along with the global rise in UPF intake, across socioeconomic strata and regional diversity.

Therefore, the current study explored how UPF consumption is related to lung cancer and its primary subtypes.

The participants were part of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Based on the NOVA system, their dietary patterns were assessed using a questionnaire and classified as UPF or otherwise.

The study found 1,706 cases of lung cancer. Of these, 1,473 were NSCLC cases, making up the vast majority (86%), with 233 SCLC cases. The mean follow-up lasted 12 years among over 101,000 adults, with an average age of 63 at the start.

UPF intake mainly consisted of lunch meat (11%) and soft drinks (13.9%), caffeinated or otherwise.

After adjusting for multiple factors that could also increase lung cancer risk, the researchers concluded that people with the highest UPF intake also had a 41% higher risk of lung cancer, compared to those who ate the least UPF. The risk of NSCLC and SCLC was comparably raised, by 37% and 44%, respectively.

Even after adjusting for total energy intake, UPF intake was still associated with lung cancer risks and NSCLC risks. Interestingly, there was no linear dose-response pattern for SCLC, though the risk increased in a non-linear pattern with either lung cancer or NSCLC.

Prior research suggests that cutting out UPF in favor of minimally processed foods could decrease the risks of neck, colon, and liver cancers. The Western diet is linked to higher lung cancer rates. The current study is, however, among the first to demonstrate a link between UPF intake and lung cancer, both overall and its subtypes.

This association with lung cancer may be driven in part by UPF's poor nutritional profile, coupled with its replacement of healthy foods that reduce the risk. UPF may also inhibit satiety responses and interfere with how the body safely disposes of high-carbohydrate foods, resulting in excessive energy intake.

Irrespective of this, however, UPF intake was still associated with increased lung cancer risk, perhaps because it also predicts a deficiency of bioactive compounds.

The additives in UPF are still under study, but could potentially play a role in carcinogenesis. For instance, carrageenan is commonly used to thicken foods, but preclinical studies indicate that it inflames the gut and may indirectly promote lung cancer, as could disruption of glutamate metabolism.

Contamination of UPF with plastics-related polychlorinated biphenyls could be another possibility, as these have estrogenic activity and might promote lung cancer cell proliferation. According to prior population studies, these chemicals persist in the body despite regulatory bans.  

The amount of industrial processing needed to produce UPF alters the structure and chemistry of the food substrate, with adverse effects on the bioavailability and potential generation of toxic substances. For instance, acrolein, found in grilled sausages and cigarette smoke, has been shown in cell studies to promote cancerous changes in the lung via mitochondrial DNA damage.

The study concluded that “higher consumption of UPF is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, NSCLC, and SCLC.” However, causality cannot be established due to the study's observational nature.

The study was mainly performed on non-Hispanic White participants, limiting its generalizability. Future studies should extend and validate these results in more diverse and larger samples. If further research confirms these associations, public health policies should aim to reduce UPF intake worldwide.

A new editorial published in Comprehensive Physiology underscores the critical importance of understanding heart-lung interactions in pulmonary vascular disease (PVD). Tim Lahm, MD, a pulmonologist and researcher at National Jewish Health, along with a team of esteemed colleagues from institutions across the country, urges the scientific community to confront the major knowledge gaps that hinder progress in improving patient outcomes. The editorial, titled ""Towards a Better Understanding of Heart-Lung Interactions in Pulmonary Vascular Disease,"" serves as a call for papers for an upcoming special issue of Comprehensive Physiology dedicated to this topic.

We've moved beyond the idea that pulmonary hypertension is simply a lung disease. The survival and well-being of patients depend not only on how we treat the lungs, but also on how the heart - particularly the right ventricle - adapts, responds or fails under pressure. The future of patient care lies in unraveling these cardiopulmonary dynamics.""

Dr. Tim Lahm, MD, pulmonologist and researcher at National Jewish Health

Drawing from a wide range of recent research, the editorial explores how the heart and lungs function as a tightly coupled unit - what the authors call a ""right atrium-right ventricle-lung vascular unit."" Dysfunction in one often exacerbates problems in the other, with systemic effects that extend beyond the thorax to the kidneys, liver, brain, skeletal muscle and more.

The editorial highlights growing evidence that pulmonary hypertension, traditionally viewed as a lung-centric disorder, is actually a systemic disease marked by two-way connections among multiple organs. The authors call for an expansion of research to explore novel signaling pathways, mechanical stressors and even emerging model systems - such as heart- and lung-on-a-chip technologies and computational approaches - that can simulate real-world cardiopulmonary conditions with greater precision.

The authors issue a call for papers for basic, translational and clinical research exploring these heart-lung interactions in PVD. This request includes investigations into molecular mediators, disease phenotyping, and innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies tailored to sex, age, disease stage and systemic factors.

New research reveals that a higher intake of creatine from meat sources may ease constipation, especially in men and younger adults. This offers a potential dietary fix for a widespread digestive issue.

Study: Association of dietary creatine intake from meat protein sources with different types of intestinal problems: insights from NHANES 2005–2010. Image credit: xm4thx/Shutterstock.com

A study published in Frontiers in Nutrition reports that a higher dietary intake of creatine from meat protein sources may help reduce the risk of chronic constipation.

Chronic diarrhea and constipation are the most common forms of gastrointestinal disorders that significantly affect the quality of life. Several factors potentially contribute to these conditions, including diet, physical activity, age, gender, and existing health conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic disorders.

Creatine is an endogenous organic compound primarily found in muscles. It is synthesized from three amino acids inside the body and plays a crucial role in muscle energy metabolism. Creatine can also be obtained from dietary sources, such as red meat and fish.

Emerging evidence highlights the potential therapeutic efficacy of creatine in various diseases, including neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. Limited evidence also suggests that creatine supplementation may influence gastrointestinal motility and function and the gut microbiota composition.

Given the potential impact of creatine on gut health, the current study was designed to explore the association between dietary creatine intake and risk of chronic diarrhea and constipation in U.S. adults aged 20 years or above.

The study conducted secondary analyses of 10,721 participants' data from the 2005-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), an ongoing survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to assess the health and nutritional status of children and adults in the United States.

The information on dietary creatine intake from animal sources and the incidence of chronic diarrhea and constipation was collected from the NHANES database.

The association between creatine intake and the risk of chronic diarrhea and constipation was assessed using appropriate statistical analyses. The potential influence of several demographic factors (age, gender, and physical activity) and health conditions (diabetes and hypertension) on the analyzed association was also examined.     

The study found that dietary intake of creatine from animal sources was associated with a significantly lower risk of chronic constipation. Specifically, a 10-fold increase in absolute creatine intake was associated with a 19% lower risk of constipation. However, the study could not find any significant impact of creatine intake on chronic diarrhea.

The subgroup analysis findings revealed that dietary creatine's observed benefits were more profound in male participants, participants younger than 48 years, and participants without hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease.

The study findings reveal that consuming creatine from animal-based foods may reduce the risk of chronic constipation. However, dietary creatine does not significantly alter the risk of diarrhea.

The study also suggests that the beneficial impact of dietary creatine on chronic constipation is more profound in males, younger individuals, smokers, drinkers, physically active individuals, and those without specific comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The authors note that these associations were significant in some subgroups, but caution that the findings are observational and do not establish cause-and-effect relationships.

Several preclinical animal studies have indicated that creatine can improve constipation by altering gut microbiota composition, intestinal barrier integrity, and stool bile acid composition. Moreover, creatine can increase material exchange and intestinal motility by improving gut cell hydration. 

According to the study findings, dietary creatine appears to have a more protective effect on constipation in men than women, possibly due to the differences in hormonal and metabolic pathways. In this context, evidence suggests that testosterone, a male reproductive hormone, mediates gender-specific differences in gut microbiota composition through the bile acid signaling pathway. Moreover, testosterone promotes creatine uptake and improves intestinal barrier integrity.

The study could not find any impact of dietary creatine on constipation in individuals with pre-existing health conditions, including hypertension and diabetes. This lack of benefits might be due to hypertension-related vascular dysfunction, which affects gastrointestinal blood flow and gut microbiota. Similarly, diabetes patients often experience gastrointestinal complications, such as gastroparesis and constipation, which may restrict creatine's ability to improve gastrointestinal function.

The researchers conducted interaction tests and found that gender significantly modified the relationships between creatine intake and constipation risk. No such interaction effects were seen for diarrhea. The study findings suggest that animal-derived creatine could be explored as a potential dietary intervention for managing chronic constipation.

The cross-sectional study design prevented the study from determining the causality of the observed association. Further experimental studies are needed to explore biological mechanisms associated with creatine-mediated gut health improvement in different subgroups.

The study used the NHANES database, which collects self-reported dietary data. This approach is frequently associated with recall bias and inaccuracies. Moreover, this database does not contain information on the duration and dosage of creatine intake. Future studies should address these factors to understand creatine's impact on gut health more conclusively.

Understanding exactly how psychedelics promote new connections in the brain is critical to developing targeted, non-hallucinogenic therapeutics that can treat neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. To achieve this, researchers are mapping the biochemical pathways involved in both neuroplasticity and hallucinations.

In new research led by the University of California, Davis, researchers found that non-hallucinogenic versions of psychedelic drugs promote neuroplasticity through the same biochemical pathway as psychedelics. However, unlike psychedelics, they don't activate genes long thought to be key players in that process.

The research, published Aug. 4 in Nature Neuroscience, compared the biochemical pathways activated by the hallucinogenic compound 5-MeO-DMT and its non-hallucinogenic analog tabernanthalog (TBG).

The prevailing hypothesis in the field was that psychedelics promote neuroplasticity by causing this big burst of glutamate in the brain, which then turns on intermediate early genes. We now know that non-hallucinogenic compounds like TBG can promote neuroplasticity without inducing a glutamate burst or immediate early gene activation.""

David E. Olson, director of the Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics and a professor of chemistry and of biochemistry and molecular medicine at UC Davis

""This work challenges the current dogma in the field,"" said John A. Gray, a co-author of the study and the associate director of the Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics as well as a professor in the Center for Neuroscience at UC Davis.

The team found that TBG promotes neuroplasticity by activating the same psychedelic receptor as 5-MeO-DMT, but the difference is the extent of the activation.

The researchers also provide the first direct evidence that a non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analog like TBG, produces sustained antidepressant-like effects through the growth of dendritic spines in the brain's prefrontal cortex.

Using pharmacological and genetic tools in rodents, the team found that both TBG and 5-MeO-DMT promoted cortical neuroplasticity by activating the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A). Both drugs then induced the downstream activation of the same receptors and proteins, including TrkB, mTOR and AMPA. 

This means that that despite TBG being non-hallucinogenic, it turns on one of the same biochemical pathways that psychedelics do. Whereas 5-MeO-DMT is a full agonist, TBG is a partial agonist.

Olson likened agonists to water faucets. Full agonists turn on the faucet all the way, allowing for a full flow of water, while partial agonists only allow for drips and limited streams. 

""Full agonists turn on hallucinations and they also turn on plasticity,"" Olson said. ""Partial agonists only turn on the receptor part way and that seems to be sufficient to turn on plasticity."" 

The study addressed an open question in psychedelic science. While the activation of 5-HT2A receptors by psychedelics is known to promote neuroplasticity, the link between this and psychedelics' sustained antidepressant effects was unclear. 

""Are the neuroplasticity-promoting effects - the growth of these dendritic spines in the prefrontal cortex - responsible for the antidepressant effects?"" Olson wondered.

It turns out, they are. 

With advanced genetic tools, the team tagged the dendritic spines that grew in the prefrontal cortex after TBG dosing. They then used lasers to erase those spines.

""When we erased those spines, the antidepressant effect went away,"" Olson said. 

Previously, this kind of experiment was conducted with ketamine to demonstrate that its sustained antidepressant-like properties required the growth of these dendritic spines.

""This is the first time that we've done this with a serotonergic agent,"" Olson said. ""And we find that cortical neuroplasticity is at least responsible for some of the compound's antidepressant-like effects."" 

While 5-MeO-DMT and TBG boasted similarities in their effects on neuroplasticity, there were critical differences. Unlike 5-MeO-DMT, TBG didn't promote bursts of glutamate or turn on immediate early genes - genes long thought to be critical for the neuroplasticity-promoting effects of psychedelics. 

""It was kind of shocking that TBG promoted plasticity, but the glutamate burst and immediate early genes were not required,"" Olson said. The team used a combination of whole brain imaging and single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile gene expression patterns following treatment with 5-MeO-DMT and TBG. ""What we found is that glutamate bursts and immediate early gene expression are probably more related to the hallucinogenic properties of psychedelics rather than their plasticity-promoting effects.""

""Science is full of surprises,"" said Gray. ""There is still so much we don't know about how psychedelics impact the brain, and it feels like we learn something new every day.""

From St John's Wort to vitamin D: This review uncovers which over-the-counter products have real scientific backing for relieving depression, and which still need proof.

Study: Understanding the research landscape of over-the-counter herbal products, dietary supplements, and medications evaluated for depressive symptoms in adults: a scoping review. Image credit: Yuliia Ushakova/Shutterstock.com

A study published in Frontiers in Pharmacology aimed to document the research evidence available for over-the-counter (OTC) products for treating depression in adults. Researchers point out the need for further research on everyday herbal products, such as lavender, chamomile, lemon balm, and Echium, used to alleviate depressive conditions, to assess their safety and efficacy.

Depression is a mental health condition characterized by persistent low mood, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, insomnia, and fatigue, which impacts overall daily life. An increased prevalence of depression, including major depressive disorder (MDD), has been documented worldwide. For example, 11.3% of the UK population experience mild depressive symptoms, 4.2% have moderate depressive symptoms, and 3.3% experience severe depressive symptoms.

Besides genetic and stress factors, deficiencies in monoamine neurotransmitters, increased production of glucocorticoids, and elevated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity led to MDD. Impaired neurogenesis from reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and gut microbial dysbiosis affecting the function of the HPA axis could cause depression. Therefore, robust strategies are needed to manage and prevent depressive symptoms in adults effectively.

According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, individuals diagnosed with depression are advised to do exercise regularly, undergo psychological therapies, and some are prescribed antidepressants. Although many strategies are available to combat depression, only 13.4% of residents of Great Britain suffering from depression receive any form of treatment. The particular challenge in accessing psychological therapies is their long waiting times.

Previous studies have shown that many people manage their depressive symptoms on their own through herbal medical products (HMPs) and vitamins and minerals rather than practitioner-directed strategies. These patients also use OTC homeopathic preparations to alleviate their depressive symptoms. However, while some individuals use homeopathic remedies, the review did not include trials evaluating homeopathic products. There are no specific OTC medicines licensed to treat these conditions. HMPs, such as St John's Wort and saffron, and omega-3 supplements are most popular among consumers due to the perception of safety and naturalness.

The current review investigated the research landscape to identify the areas with a higher volume of literature and those with a limited number of studies. Therefore, it helped recognize the existing gaps in research, allowing scientists to conduct future studies on products for depressive symptoms.

All available trial evidence for OTC products for anxiety, insomnia, and depression was considered. All relevant articles were obtained from five databases:  MEDLINE, PsycINFO, AMED, Embase, and CENTRAL, from inception to December 2022. Due to the large volume of studies, researchers synthesized data based on overall and specific product types. The analysis used methods called vote counting to summarize product effectiveness across studies.

The current review considered 209 articles that evaluated products for depression symptoms and fulfilled various other research criteria, including participants who were between 18 and 60 years of age. Trials considered in this review were mainly performed in Iran, Germany, Australia, the US, the UK, and China. The median size of participants recruited in trials was 70. In most trials, participants were required to have a depression diagnosis at baseline, while certain studies followed a symptom scale cutoff for participant recruitment.

The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression Scale were common depression scales used in the selected studies.

It must be noted that all considered studies focused on evaluating the efficacy of dietary supplements and a small number of single chemical medicines, but not homeopathic products, for alleviating depressive symptoms. Since 1973, a general increase in the number of trials evaluating dietary supplements for depression has been observed, peaking in 2019 with an average of 3.2 trials per year.

Many studies on omega-3s, St John's Wort, probiotics, saffron, and vitamin D have been conducted to evaluate their efficacy against depression symptoms. However, considerable deviation in extracts, methodology, formulations, and dosage was noted.

Many studies revealed the use of St John's Wort as a monotherapy to treat depressive symptoms of people with no comorbidities. Based on vote counting, St John's Wort demonstrated higher efficacy, sometimes even more effective than prescription antidepressants.

Saffron products have been assessed across a broader range of comorbid conditions than St John's Wort, including postpartum, menopause, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. In contrast to a placebo, saffron exhibited a prominent antidepressant effect. Comparisons with prescription medications generally found similar levels of effectiveness.

Vitamin D has been mainly evaluated as an adjunct to prescribed medication and/or cognitive behavioural therapy. Across placebo comparisons, vitamin D was more often effective than not.

Contradictory or mixed findings have been documented for melatonin, magnesium, curcumin, cinnamon, Echium, vitamin C, vitamin D, and vitamin D combined with calcium, reflecting the need for further well-designed trials. One omega-3 trial reported specific safety concerns. Overall, 85% of trials that reported safety outcomes did not identify safety concerns, but 31% of studies lacked sufficient safety reporting details.

Many ongoing trials are assessing the therapeutic potential of vitamin D, three omega-3s, and a range of HMPs to treat depression.

The current review highlighted many dietary supplements and herbal medical products that are being assessed to treat depression. The authors highlighted gaps in research about a smaller number of trials with large sample sizes, and indicated the need for further replications of results to validate the accuracy. More research is required to optimize the dosage and herbal preparation. Further evaluation on folic acid, lavender, tryptophan, zinc, rhodiola, bitter orange, lemon balm, and chamomile is required to assess their antidepressant potential.

The authors also recommend further exploration of OTC products as adjuncts to psychological therapies to support an integrative approach.

A surprising new drug combo—including a compound found in chocolate—has outperformed Tamiflu in fighting the flu, according to a study published in PNAS. The mix of Theobromine and Arainosine proved far more effective against a range of flu strains, including drug-resistant versions of bird and swine flu. By targeting a key viral weakness, this breakthrough could lead to stronger, longer-lasting treatments—not just for the flu, but potentially for other viruses as well.

In a potential game-changer for how we treat the flu, scientists have unveiled a new drug pairing that outperforms Tamiflu—the most widely used anti-influenza medication—against even the deadliest flu strains, including bird(avian) and swine flu.

The surprising duo? One of them is Theobromine, a compound found in chocolate.

In a study recently published in PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, led by Prof. Isaiah (Shy) Arkin, have developed a novel combination therapy that targets a key weakness in the influenza virus: its ion channel, a microscopic gate the virus uses to replicate and spread. By blocking this gate, the team effectively cut off the virus's ability to survive.

Their study, conducted at Israel's new Barry Skolnick Biosafety Level 3 facility, tested this combo—Theobromine and a lesser-known compound called Arainosine—against a broad range of flu viruses. In both cell cultures and animal trials, the treatment dramatically outperformed Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), especially against drug-resistant strains.

""We're not just offering a better flu drug,"" said Prof. Arkin. ""We're introducing a new way to target viruses—one that may help us prepare for future pandemics.""

The stakes are high: Influenza continues to sweep the globe each year, with unpredictable mutations that challenge vaccines and existing drugs. In the U.S. alone, seasonal flu costs an estimated $87 billion annually in healthcare and lost productivity. Past pandemics—like the 2009 swine flu—have inflicted even deeper global costs, and the cost of future pandemics was estimated to rise even further up to $4.4 trillion.

Meanwhile, outbreaks of avian flu have devastated poultry industries and sparked fears of cross-species transmission to humans. Just one recent outbreak in the U.S. led to the loss of 40 million birds and billions in economic damage.

Current flu treatments, like Tamiflu, are losing ground as the virus adapts. Most drugs in use target a viral protein that mutates frequently, rendering treatments less effective over time. That's where Arkin's team saw an opening.

Instead of fighting the virus head-on with traditional antivirals, the researchers zeroed in on the M2 ion channel—a crucial viral feature that helps the virus replicate. Past efforts to block this channel have largely failed due to drug resistance. But the new Theobromine-Arainosine combo sidesteps this resistance, even neutralizing hard-to-treat strains.

The team discovered the combo by scanning a library of repurposed compounds—many originally developed for other diseases—and testing their effects on both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant versions of the virus.

The implications extend beyond influenza. Because many viruses—including coronaviruses and others—also rely on ion channels, this new approach could form the basis of future antiviral strategies.

The next steps include human clinical trials, but the early results offer hope not just for a better flu treatment, but for a smarter way to fight viral disease in general. ViroBlock, a startup company emanating from the Hebrew University, has been entrusted to develop the discoveries to reach the public.

A team of Chinese researchers led by Prof. GAO Caixia from the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed two new genome editing technologies, known collectively as Programmable Chromosome Engineering (PCE) systems.

The study, published online in Cell on August 4, achieves multiple types of precise DNA manipulations ranging from kilobase to megabase scale in higher organisms, especially plants.

Extensive research has demonstrated the immense potential of the site-specific recombinase Cre-Lox system for precise chromosomal manipulation. However, its broader application has been hindered by three critical limitations: (1) reversible recombination reactions-stemming from the inherent symmetry of Lox sites-can negate desired edits; (2) the tetrameric nature of Cre recombinase complicates engineering efforts, hindering activity optimization; and (3) residual Lox sites after recombination may compromise editing precision.

The research team addressed each of these challenges and developed novel methods to advance the state of this technology. First, they built a high-throughput platform for rapid recombination site modification and proposed an asymmetric Lox site design. This led to the development of novel Lox variants that reduce reversible recombination activity by over 10-fold (approaching the background level of negative controls) while retaining high-efficiency forward recombination.

They then leveraged their recently developed AiCE (AI-informed Constraints for protein Engineering), model-a protein-directed evolution system integrating general inverse folding models with structural and evolutionary constraints-to develop AiCErec, a recombinase engineering method. This approach enabled precise optimization of Cre's multimerization interface, yielding an engineered variant with a recombination efficiency 3.5 times that of wild-type Cre.

Lastly, they designed and refined a scarless editing strategy for recombinases. By harnessing the high editing efficiency of prime editors, they developed Re-pegRNA, a method that uses specifically designed pegRNAs to perform re-prime editing on residual Lox sites, precisely replacing them with the original genomic sequence, thereby ensuring seamless genome modifications.

The integration of these three innovations led to the creation of two programmable platforms, PCE and RePCE. These platforms allow flexible programming of insertion positions and orientations for different Lox sites, enabling precise, scarless manipulation of DNA fragments ranging from kilobase to megabase scale in both plant and animal cells. Key achievements include: targeted integration of large DNA fragments up to 18.8 kb, complete replacement of 5-kb DNA sequences, chromosomal inversions spanning 12 Mb, chromosomal deletions of 4 Mb, and whole-chromosome translocations.

As a proof of concept, the researchers used this technology to create herbicide-resistant rice germplasm with a 315-kb precise inversion, showcasing its transformative potential for genetic engineering and crop improvement.

This pioneering work not only overcomes the historical limitations of the Cre-Lox system but also opens new avenues for precise genome engineering in a variety of organisms.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Cognitive shift explains children's growing understanding of emotions","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250804/Cognitive-shift-explains-childrene28099s-growing-understanding-of-emotions.aspx","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 15:55:00 GMT","

Why do young children often miss the emotions behind adult expressions? A pioneering study led by researcher Xie Wanze from Peking University's School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, in collaboration with professor Seth Pollak from the University of Wisconsin, reveals that the answer lies in a cognitive shift. Published in Nature Communications, their research shows how children aged 5-10 transition from merely ""seeing"" facial expressions to deeply understanding emotions, relying less on instinct and more on learned insight.

Interpreting emotions is crucial for social bonds, yet children often struggle to decode adult feelings. This process involves perceiving facial features and applying conceptual knowledge to grasp emotional meaning. The study investigates how these cognitive mechanisms develop during childhood, filling a gap in understanding the developmental trajectory of emotion recognition.

As children grow, their ability to navigate complex social environments depends on a refined understanding of emotions. This research offers insights into how cognitive processes develop, with potential implications for education, parenting, and interventions for children facing social-emotional challenges.

The study explored how children process emotions through three interconnected experiments, spanning neural activity, conceptual understanding, and behavior. In the first experiment on perception, researchers used EEG frequency tagging to show that even five-year-old children could automatically differentiate between four core facial expressions - happiness, anger, fear, and sadness - through neural responses localized in the temporo-occipital region. This perceptual ability appeared stable across different age groups. The second experiment examined conceptual knowledge through a word-similarity task, revealing that older children had more nuanced emotional associations, such as linking the word ""crying"" to multiple emotions, an indication of developing emotional complexity. Lastly, in the behavioral study, children participated in sorting and matching tasks. Younger participants tended to categorize expressions in broad terms of positive versus negative. At the same time, older children displayed a more refined understanding by distinguishing between specific negative emotions like anger and fear.

To integrate these findings, the team used Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) alongside Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to trace the cognitive dynamics underlying emotion understanding. The results revealed a distinct developmental shift: younger children rely more heavily on perceptual cues, while older children increasingly depend on conceptual knowledge. This progression from ""seeing faces"" to ""understanding feelings"" underscores how emotional development is shaped by experience, learning, and growing cognitive sophistication throughout childhood.

This research highlights the dynamic interplay between perception and conceptual knowledge in children's emotional development, offering a foundation for designing age-appropriate educational and therapeutic strategies to enhance social-emotional skills.

Trinity Rodman took the field for the first time in almost four months, and she wasted no time scoring the game-winning goal in stoppage time.

Rodman, who dealt with a lingering back injury, last played for the Washington Spirit on April 12 and returned to action on Friday against the Portland Thorns in a 2-1 victory. The 23-year-old forward subbed in the 75th minute when the score was tied 1-1. Two minutes into stoppage time, Rodman slammed a right-footed shot high into the far post. She was assisted by fellow USWNT player Croix Bethune, who sent a touch pass to Rodman on the right side of the box.

Rodman didn't initially celebrate like a player might typically do. Instead, she took a second to process the weight of the moment, cupping her hands over her mouth in shock before her teammates flocked to her. It was emotional for Rodman to not only return to the field — but score too — after months of rehab. 

“That was the hardest thing I've had to go through with the injury and everything,” Rodman said after the match, fighting back tears. “Being back, especially at the home stadium with the crowd behind me, scoring a goal like that. You saw I buried it; I was not going to miss it. I'm just really happy to be back. I miss the team., I miss doing what I love.”

It was Rodman's first NWSL goal since last season in a victory over the Houston Dash on Sept. 15, 2024. Before Friday, she'd most recently scored for the National Team when she played her first and only match of 2025 thus far on April 5 against Brazil. That time, she also scored fast – in the sixth minute of action.

With the win, the Washington Spirit sit No. 3 in the league, tied in record and points with second-place Orlando Pride.

Malo Gusto has opened up on reflecting on the season just gone, Club World Cup victory and what he's chasing next. 

Chelsea right-back Malo Gusto posted a video to his Instagram followers on Sunday, showing the preparation he is doing as the new season approaches. 

Gusto was brilliant at the Club World Cup, playing a key role in stifling PSG's lethal wide attackers in a dominant final win. The 22-year-old has grown into his role at Stamford Bridge, with Gusto even earning a Brazil call-up for his performances last season.

But he's not stopping there, and wants to be a driving force in helping Chelsea exceed expectations again this season. 

World champions isn't enough for Gusto, who wants to keep pushing for more next season. 

Chelsea aren't favourites for the Premier League title, but they will be up at that end of the table, competing with the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City. It's great to hear such ambition from a young player, showing the strong mentality fostered in the dressing room. 

Malo Gusto on Instagram 💙 pic.twitter.com/kpQaIlF1aD

Another possible interpretation of ‘bigger' is the Champions League, which Chelsea are returning to after a two-year hiatus. 

They have already shown they can beat the best European sides, and having won the competition already this decade, they should feel confident about being able to challenge for Europe's elite trophy. 

Malo Gusto got a chance to shine at right-back last season with Reece James' extended absence. On the opposite side, Marc Cucurella was run into the ground at times. 

Now, with the signing of Hato, Chelsea have two full backlines that they can field next season, which will allow them to stay competitive on all fronts and avoid fatigue.

It gives Enzo Maresca incredible tactical versatility. pic.twitter.com/taiQAuGzVV

Gusto may feel hard done by in relation to minutes this season, as he probably gets into every starting XI in the league, bar Arsenal and maybe Spurs. 

Unfortunately, if James is back fit and firing, as Chelsea's leader, he will keep Gusto out of the side, and the inverted left-back role that the Brazilian has filled at times will also likely be occupied.

But Gusto is determined and won't shy away from the challenge of competing for Enzo Maresca's favour. He wants to win.  ","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

The Club World Cup was a testing ground in numerous aspects of event staging for FIFA ahead of next summer's Men's World Cup. As FIFA's senior manager/accessibility and safeguarding, Linda Mastandrea's purview was no exception. 

Five of the venues that hosted CWC games this summer and have World Cup matches next year -- Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Hard Rock Stadium, MetLife Stadium, Lincoln Financial Field and Lumen Field -- were part of a pilot effort in which sign language interpreters sat in the stands or in suites with groups of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans. They translated any player introductions, match commentary and stadium announcements those fans would have otherwise missed. 

“There is this feeling that deaf people can see the action, but they miss out on that commentary when a foul is called or a red card is given,” said Mastandrea. 

FIFA reached out to deaf fans and accessibility advisory groups in the various cities ahead of the CWC matches, then worked with an interpreter services agency to hire local interpreters. 

“We discovered there is an interest [and] we got a lot of positive feedback,” Mastandrea said. “So, we want to make sure we're adding that to the mix of services.” 

Ideally, FIFA and the venues could incorporate tech that would allow deaf fans to receive sign language interpretation regardless of where they were seated in the stadium. Equally, they're looking at audio description for fans with vision issues. 

“There is so much happening in the tech universe with OneCourt and other haptic devices,” Mastandrea said. “We had a chance to demo them in the office for people to see and understand them, so I think there will continue to be innovations in the tech space with accessibility. The experience for people with sensory, visual, auditory issues will continue to improve.” 

Mastandrea, who joined FIFA in 2024 on a contract basis through Aug. 2026, is deeply qualified for this role. She's a former Paralympian who represented the U.S. in the Barcelona and Atlanta Olympics before becoming a lawyer focused on disability law. 

Mastandrea's work during the last year-plus included site visits to all the stadiums and determining whether accessibility features that FIFA requires were present or needed to be enhanced. She's met with host cities to discuss the accessibility of transit systems, rideshares, hotels, public services and is working internally on making the ticket-buying process as easy as possible.

Deossa Arrives with Momentum and International Experience


Real Betis have officially announced the signing of Colombian midfielder Nelson Deossa, who joins from Rayados de Monterrey on a contract running until 2030. The 25-year-old impressed at the recent Club World Cup and now becomes one of head coach Manuel Pellegrini's key additions for the upcoming season.





Deossa landed in Seville on Sunday, where he was welcomed by sporting director Manu Fajardo. After completing his medical, the transfer was finalized following direct negotiations with the Mexican club. Both Fajardo and Betis CEO Ramón Alarcón traveled to Monterrey to close the deal in person.

A product of Atlético Huila, Deossa made his professional debut in 2021. He had stints with Estudiantes de La Plata, Atlético Nacional, and Júnior de Barranquilla before moving to Mexico in 2024. With Pachuca, he won the Concacaf Champions Cup and later joined Rayados, where he scored seven goals and provided one assist in 29 official matches.


Joins Betis Mid-Preseason Ahead of LaLiga Opener


The Betis squad, led by Pellegrini, recently returned from a training camp in England at St. George's Park, and began a new phase of preseason preparations this Monday in Marbella. The team will play two key friendlies before the start of the LaLiga campaign.

On Wednesday, they will face Como, featuring former Betis players Jesús Rodríguez and Assane Diao, followed by a clash with Málaga on Saturday at La Rosaleda. These matches will wrap up Betis' preseason before their league debut.









Now under Pellegrini's guidance, Deossa aims to establish himself in the midfield and prove that his top form in Mexican football can translate to Spanish success.

On a sunny afternoon at the MetLife Stadium with over 80,000 in attendance, Chelsea satisfied their taste for success by winning the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup. They recorded a 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in the final.

It was the culmination of a tournament that often had attention focused on organisational issues, low attendances and fatigue concerns.

To call this a shock result is considered an understatement by many. PSG are the current Champions League holders, winning it in dominant fashion and had since recorded comprehensive wins over Inter Miami, Bayern Munich, and Real Madrid en route to the final.

Tempers flared at full-time, with both teams involved in scuffles

Chelsea didn't face opposition as illustrious, but certainly through no fault of their own. They faced Benfica, Palmeiras, and Fluminense on their way to the final. As such, PSG were heavy favourites to lift the new trophy.

But the Blues had other plans. They started out confidently, aiming to catch the Parisians off guard. An early effort from Cole Palmer gave PSG warning, but it wasn't to be heeded, as the Englishman later opened the score with a low, well placed finish in the bottom-left corner.

Palmer extended Chelsea's lead with an almost identical goal not long after, and then he would turn provider for new Chelsea signing João Pedro, who cleverly lifted the ball over goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to mark a dominant half for Chelsea.

The second half was not as eventful, but Chelsea wouldn't care, as they held firm to deny PSG. Robert Sánchez was excellent in goal, and the clean sheet a testament to his effort.

If the match wasn't already over, it would be after PSG midfielder João Neves was shown a straight red card towards the end of the game for pulling the hair of Marc Cucurella.

Tempers flared at full-time, with both teams involved in scuffles that demonstrated the emotional investment many critics said teams would lack during the tournament.

Chelsea's midfield and defence were also stellar

Chelsea's players again showed up when they needed to. Another final, another fantastic performance in particular from Cole Palmer, who had been criticised for his lack of goals and assists earlier in the season. He will certainly be happy with his recent contributions.

João Pedro must also be loving life at Chelsea. Joining the team mid-tournament (and during his holiday), he has made an instant impact. His goal in the final means that he has scored three times in two starts for the club, a return that he will only want to build on.

Chelsea's midfield and defence were also stellar – Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez controlled their Parisian counterparts for much of the game, and the back line did incredibly well to keep out the team that put four past Real Madrid, and five against Inter Milan.

Chelsea have become the first ever winners of the Club World Cup

Speaking to club media after the game, head coach Enzo Maresca expressed admiration and joy for his players. “It's been a fantastic season, but I'm especially happy for the players. One year ago, when I joined the club I said that I was in love with this squad and it was true.”

“But talent is not enough – you need sacrifice, you need togetherness, you need a game plan where all the players think in the same way. So, it's just because of them.”

US President Donald Trump handed the trophy and medals to Chelsea, and while he remained on the stage for the trophy lift to the confusion of many (including Cole Palmer), it certainly did not overshadow the celebrations.

Now adding to their Conference League triumph, Chelsea have become the first ever winners of the Club World Cup – which is officially recognised by FIFA, who have also renamed the previous version as the Intercontinental Cup. It will surely be an honour the London side will look back on with pride.

Questions are now being asked about Chelsea's readiness as title contenders – they have shown that they can beat the best in the world, but will this team be able to consistently perform in the Premier League, up against the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal?

What can be said is that the signs are positive for Chelsea, and their young, fearless core of players will no doubt take the challenge on and strive for more success.

FIFA is bringing the 2026 Men's World Cup to Canada, the United States and Mexico.

Of the 104 games that will make up the tournament, 13 will be played in Canada. Vancouver is set to host seven, with the remaining six Canadian games slated for Toronto.

But hosting those 13 soccer games isn't cheap.

Taxpayers may be on the hook for more than a billion dollars.

The Vancouver leg of the tournament could set taxpayers back up to $624 million, while in Toronto, the costs are pegged at up to $380 million.

Even after factoring in projected revenues, Vancouver's games are expected to come at a net cost to the taxpayer of $85-$145 million, according to the B.C. Government's own generous projections. Ontario hasn't been transparent enough with taxpayers to provide those kinds of net cost breakdowns.

And even if you don't live in British Columbia or Ontario, your tax dollars are still bankrolling the tournament.

The federal government is also getting in on the action, subsidizing the games to the tune of $220 million.

The federal government is giving Vancouver $116 million to help pay for the tournament. It's also shelling out over $104 million to Toronto to offset costs for things like fan festivals and police motorcades for FIFA delegations.

All three levels of government are spending money on these soccer games. The federal government is giving cash to the municipalities as a grant. Most of the provincial money is being spent on provincial services for the games, like stadium renovations in B.C. and provincial police officers in Ontario.

Here's the real kicker: most British Columbia and Ontario taxpayers don't even want to host the World Cup.

Polling from Leger shows that 55 per cent of British Columbians and 56 per cent of Ontarians don't think the soccer games are worth the cost.

And who can blame them?

According to the B.C. government's own estimates, the games are going to come at a net cost of up to $145 million for taxpayers. That means the province is going to be losing money on these games.

How the money going to these games is being spent should raise eyebrows. FIFA bigwigs are demanding preferential treatment, funded by taxpayers.

FIFA's contract with Vancouver demands the “VIP/VVIP,” treatment from taxpayers, for any “individuals nominated by FIFA.” Those very and very, very important people will be met at the gate and taken to “special” immigration, customs and security screening points. They will have access to exclusive waiting rooms, special luggage collection and even VIP parking, according to the contracts signed with Vancouver and Toronto.

In fact, Toronto and Vancouver councils even promised police escorts and road closures for anyone nominated by FIFA.

Why would soccer executives need to cruise around Toronto or Vancouver with a police escort on closed streets? Why did our politicians promise to use taxpayer money to pay for that kind of excess?

And FIFA's ethics record would make a tin-pot dictator green with envy. Dozens of former FIFA executives have been indicted and criminally charged over the years, with fraud, money laundering and corruption.

When an international soccer organization has a long track record of corruption and mismanaging its own money, why are we spending more than a billion dollars of our money to host a FIFA tournament?

It's important to read the fine print in the contracts. The host cities “unconditionally and irrevocably accepts as final and binding any decision by FIFA,” reads the contract. “FIFA may, during the term of this host city agreement, unilaterally specify, modify, reduce and/or enhance the obligations of the host city.”

Vancouver and Toronto's contracts give FIFA control over how taxpayer money is spent on the tournament. Expensive goodies like road closures, fan zones, exclusion bubbles around the stadium and security protocols are all under FIFA's control.

Those clauses give FIFA the final say over various aspects of the tournament. If FIFA doesn't like the fan festivals that Vancouver or Toronto put on, it can demand more. If FIFA isn't happy with the VIP suites at the stadium, more luxurious ones are built — which is exactly what happened in Vancouver.

And the price tag to attend the games freezes out most Canadian families whose taxes are paying for them. Tickets currently start at $2,500 for a single match and go up to $15,975 for a package that includes all the games in either Vancouver or Toronto.

The same Canadian soccer fans who are footing the bill with their tax dollars are being priced out of attending the tournament.

Enough is enough. Not a dime of taxpayer money should be spent on the World Cup.

It's time the Swiss soccer executives to pay for their own motorcades. If FIFA wants to put on a tournament, it can do it without taxpayer subsidies.

Breaking News, Podcasts and Analysis Serving People who Organize, Manage and Host Sports Events

When the FIFA World Cup was last in the United States in 1994, its lasting legacy was the formation of Major League Soccer, which has grown to 30 teams around the U.S. and Canada.

Next summer's return of the World Cup to North America has led to an evaluation and in some cases a fresh look at what host cities want to be able to have as a legacy project with everything from new community venues to deeper relationships within the region

“The legacy of how can we increase programs, places and people are really are our key initiatives,” said Monica Paul, president of the North Texas FIFA World Cup Organizing Committee. “We did four years ago an analysis based on four cities within our region — Fort Worth, Frisco, Dallas and Arlington and the demand for youth soccer.

“We were 150-plus soccer fields short,” Paul continued. “We need to move the needle. We're trying to identify regions from underserved perspectives where it could be a mini-pitch, street pitch, etc., integrating soccer into middle schools and getting access to kids who can play the sport.”

Seattle Host Committee Chief Strategy Officer April Putney referenced the city's hosting of the 1962 World's Fair, which changed the city's skyline forever with the Space Needle.

“We have really centered legacy and planning in all aspects of our World Cup work,” Putney said. “We think it's core to our success. We don't think hosting a single sporting event is going to change the world or solve all our community's ills but it would be remiss to not leverage this … We are focused on delivering a people-based legacy.”

Seattle's first host city supporter was not a business but instead the Puyallup Tribe of Indians, marking the first time in the tournament's history that an indigenous people have entered into an agreement with any host city.

The official announcement in June 2023 was in front of a red and black mural depicting one of the oldest forms of competition in North America, sləhal, as the Puyallup Tribe will be an Official Legacy Supporter for all Seattle26 activities and activations.

Puyallup people have lived along the shores of what is now called Puget Sound since time immemorial. The Puyallup Tribe will work with SeattleFWC26 on a number of initiatives throughout the next several years to allow the tribe the opportunity to share their story, in their own voice, on the global stage.

“We are doing things appropriately and right for our city and our region,” Putney said. “(The Tribe is) really excited to be able to tell their story about their past and their amazing future and all Indigenous people.”

Philadelphia Soccer 2026 will partner with the U.S. Soccer Foundation to invest $2 million in youth soccer initiatives surrounding the local region. Other cities are also partnering with the U.S. Soccer Federation on mini-pitches in their communities. U.S. Soccer has launched a Soccer Forward Foundation to reach diverse communities.

In Northern California, the Bay Area Host Committee has set up the BAHC Foundation with focuses on workforce development, sports for all and sports for change, plus green communities.

“When you're launching a sports hub and people are reacting and you see kids playing on something that you've developed, it makes you feel like we can actually have a real impact on this region,” said BAHC President and CEO Zaileen Janmohamed.

The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious football tournament in the world, where players of all ages showcase their skills. Throughout history, a special group of young talents has made a lasting impression by becoming some of the youngest goalscorers in FIFA World Cup history. These players managed to score crucial goals at a very early age, setting records and inspiring generations. Here, we explore the top 10 youngest goalscorers in FIFA World Cup history, starting from the 10th youngest and moving to the very youngest.

Martin Hoffmann earned his place among the youngest goalscorers in FIFA World Cup history when he scored for East Germany at just 19 years and 88 days old during the 1974 tournament. His goal is a fine example of how young players can leave their mark on the world's biggest stage. Hoffmann's early success in the World Cup underlines the importance of youth talent in international football.

Belgium's Divock Origi showed immense potential by becoming one of the youngest goalscorers in FIFA World Cup history. At 19 years and 65 days old during the 2014 World Cup, Origi's goal illustrated how young talent can impact high-pressure matches. His name is now remembered alongside other young stars who scored early in their World Cup careers, proving age is just a number.

Julian Green became one of the youngest goalscorers in FIFA World Cup history when he scored for the United States at only 19 years and 25 days old during the 2014 tournament. His goal highlighted the rising talents in American soccer and showed how the sport is growing worldwide. Green's achievement reflects the trend of younger players making a significant impact on the global stage early in their careers.

Before turning 19, Lionel Messi made history as one of the youngest goalscorers in FIFA World Cup history by scoring his first World Cup goal at 18 years and 357 days in 2006. This goal was not only a personal milestone but also the beginning of a legendary international career. Messi's early success underlines how youth talent can translate into long-term dominance on football's biggest stage.

At just 18 years and 231 days, Dmitri Sychev became one of the youngest goalscorers in FIFA World Cup history by scoring for Russia in the 2002 World Cup. His early goal reflected not only his individual talent but also how youth players are increasingly trusted in major tournaments. Sychev's name is among those young stars whose early goals made headlines worldwide.

Nicolae Kovacs is remembered as one of the youngest goalscorers in FIFA World Cup history after scoring for Romania at 18 years and 197 days in 1934. His goal is a reminder of how young talent has always been part of World Cup history, even in its early days. Kovacs's contribution demonstrates that youth players have been influential throughout football's evolution.

England's Michael Owen joined the list of youngest goalscorers in FIFA World Cup history when he scored his first World Cup goal at just 18 years and 190 days in 1998. Owen's goal introduced him as a star to watch, and it set the tone for an outstanding career. His early impact proved how youthful energy combined with skill can change the dynamics of World Cup matches.

In the 2022 World Cup, Spain's Gavi became one of the youngest goalscorers in FIFA World Cup history by scoring at only 18 years and 110 days old. His goal represented Spain's faith in youth development and was a sign of the exciting talent emerging from the country. Gavi's achievement shows the continuous influx of young players rising to World Cup challenges.

Manuel Rosas is one of the earliest names among the youngest goalscorers in FIFA World Cup history. Scoring at 18 years and 93 days during the first-ever World Cup in 1930, Rosas set a precedent for young players to follow. His goal was a milestone that helped establish the importance of youthful talent in international football from the very beginning.

Pele remains the youngest goalscorer in FIFA World Cup history. He scored his first World Cup goal at an astonishing 17 years and 239 days during the 1958 tournament. Pele's record stands unmatched, inspiring countless young players globally. As the top name among the youngest goalscorers in FIFA World Cup, his early impact on football history cannot be overstated.

The third day of the fifth and final Test match between England and India at the historic Kennington Oval ended with high drama and set the stage for an intense finish.

Ruben Neves says Diogo Jota's memory will spur Portugal on at next year's World Cup and make them more determined than ever to win the trophy.

Jota, who had 49 caps and scored 14 goals for his country, died along with his brother Andre Silva in a car crash at the beginning of July.

Neves played with the late Portuguese international for both the national side and Wolves, and was a close friend of his for many years.

Indeed, Neves helped to carry Jota's coffin just hours after competing in the Club World Cup with Al-Hilal in the United States.

He said: ""We were already eager to do this [win the World Cup] for Portugal, but now we have even more motivation.

Jota had won the Nations League with his country just a month before he passed away, and Neves believes the Portugal players have benefitted from his presence in the side over the years.

He added: ""I think each of us [in the national team] has inherited a little bit of what Diogo was on the pitch, and we're going to do our best to help him win that title [the World Cup] with us.""

Portugal begin their World Cup qualifying campaign against Armenia on September 6.

          China Daily |
          Updated: 2025-08-04 09:08
        

 

Tough US immigration policies are casting doubts on the inclusive vision of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as experts say harsh border policies could suppress foreign attendance and damage North America's image.

Victor Matheson, a professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts who specializes in the economics of mega sports events, said the travel restrictions will significantly affect fans, especially those from countries targeted by the United States' immigration policies.

""The fears of players are probably not justified, but the fears of fans are fully justified,"" Matheson said.

As of June, the US government had fully banned travel by citizens of 12 countries and imposed partial restrictions on travelers from seven others.

A State Department memo indicates officials are reviewing travel policy toward an additional 36 countries, which could face new entry bans if they fail to meet US security and information-sharing standards within the next 60 days.

Despite the tightened policies, Matheson does not expect the restrictions to reduce overall attendance at matches across North America.

""I expect essentially every game to be a sellout in all three countries,"" he said. ""However, the stadiums will be full of Americans and not foreign tourists."" He said the number of fans from Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America is ""likely to be much lower than it would have been under a different regime"".

This shift in audience composition could have economic consequences, he said. ""It is the foreign visitors that have the largest positive economic impact on the host country for a mega event like this.""

As a tournament spanning three nations, the 2026 World Cup will require close cross-border coordination — a process that could be complicated by US border policies, he added. ""This is likely to complicate movement of fans and merchandise across national borders.""

The broader reputational damage, however, may be harder to contain, Matheson said.

""There is no doubt that (US President Donald) Trump's actions have significantly worsened the overall image of the United States in every way, including the country's reputation as a welcoming place for foreign visitors.

""Trump has made it quite clear that foreign visitors, foreign students, foreign companies and immigrants should stay away.""

The negative perception is unlikely to spill over to Canada or Mexico, he said. ""Most people paying attention know this is entirely on Trump and not on our neighbors.""

Asked whether national security can be reasonably balanced with global openness during such events, Matheson was blunt.

""There are legitimate security concerns during any mega event,"" he said, referencing terrorist incidents in past Olympic Games. ""But none of this is about security. There is no real security threat to the US from Haiti or Equatorial Guinea.""

Instead, he said he believes the current policy is driven by domestic political motives.

""The ban on fans from these areas is purely xenophobia on the part of Trump,"" he said, adding the administration is concerned that soccer fans from certain countries will overstay their visas.

""A large percentage of illegal migration in any country is not people sneaking across a border in the middle of the night but instead coming through a legal entry and then overstaying their visit,"" he said. ""One way to limit these overstays is to simply prevent people, like soccer fans, from entering in the first place.""

Voicing concerns

Tough US immigration and border policies are also raising concerns among Canadian experts.

""From Canada's perspective, recent US immigration and border policies pose significant concerns for co-hosting the World Cup,"" said Amy Peng, an associate professor of economics at Toronto Metropolitan University.

""These concerns extend beyond just the logistics of the event and touch upon broader issues of international perception, fan experience and even human rights,"" Peng said.

""Strict travel bans or heightened scrutiny at the US border could deter fans from numerous countries from attending, even if their teams are playing in Canada.""

Heightened US border enforcement could make cross-border movements difficult and unpredictable, potentially ruining the ""vacation of a lifetime"" for some, she said. ""Concerns about US policies might lead more fans to attend games held in Canada, potentially creating an imbalance in attendance figures between the host countries.""

Beyond immigration, US trade policies, including tariffs on Canadian goods, could also affect the flow of merchandise and supplies, such as team jerseys, she added.","{'href': 'https://global.chinadaily.com.cn', 'title': 'China Daily - Global Edition'}","soccer"

Every summer, GOAL publishes its exclusive list of the 25 players who have proven themselves truly elite by consistently producing top performances

World-class... It's an invisible but important tag, one that separates the good from the great. But it's such a subjective term. Every football fan has their own definition, their own set of criterion, leading to endless but thoroughly enjoyable debates in stadiums, dressing rooms, TV studios, cafes, bars, pubs and clubs all across the world.

So, back in 2023, GOAL decided to get in on the fun by compiling a very exclusive list of the 25 players that we felt represented the game's elite, the best of the best, the guys that had been producing stellar performances over a sustained period of time.

In order to avoid focusing solely on attackers - which, let's face it, nearly always happens when it comes to individual awards and accolades - we stipulated that there must be at least three players from each position group (goalkeeper, defence, midfield and attack), and a maximum of nine from each.

Members are subject to an annual review, and now the time has once again come to decide who gets to stay in the World-Class Club - and who must be politely asked to leave.

So, who's made this year's 25-strong selection? Find out below, and be sure to express your approval - or outrage - in the comments...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Red Devils' captain has demanded more signings before the season begins, and we've picked out some of those they should be looking to recruit

Bruno Fernandes had just picked up a trophy, but he was in no mood for celebration. Manchester United had sealed the Premier League Summer Series title after beating West Ham, Bournemouth and drawing with Everton, but the performance in Sunday's 2-2 draw with the Toffees had deflated the initial excitement that surrounded the Red Devils' pre-season tour, and Fernandes was not interested in beating around the bush.

He called out the attitude of some of his team-mates and made a call to United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe to make more signings before the real action begins, despite the club splashing out £133 million ($176m) on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha while failing to make any money back on player sales. 

""Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today. We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment,"" the United captain told NBC Sports.  [The squad] is improving. But it's not the place it needs to be. I don't want to take a dig at anyone, but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about. 

""It was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little more to get to the XI, and I think that is what the club are trying to do. Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.""

Fernandes comments will probably not have gone down well with Ratcliffe and United's other directors, but the midfielder, who resisted a hugely tempting offer from Al-Hilal earlier in the summer, was speaking the truth. His team still looked vulnerable in defence, in goal and in central midfield, and with no further investment in the squad it would be difficult to see how they can gatecrash the Premier League's top four next season and qualify for the Champions League, which should be the main objective.

So here, then, are the players United should be looking to sign before the transfer window shuts on September 1, if not before they kick-off their campaign against Arsenal on August 17:","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Ben Shelton is one of the biggest names on the ATP Tour at the moment. 

Shelton, who is currently at a career-high ranking, is continuing to have an impact at the biggest tournaments.

The American has even set himself a big goal for this year, as Shelton looks to qualify for a tournament for the first time.

After his latest win at the Canadian Open, where Shelton was involved in controversy with Flavio Cobolli, he pointed out an issue he has noticed on the ATP Tour.

The Canadian Open is being held over 12 days for the first time this year, as part of both the ATP and WTA Tours bid to continue expanding 1000 level tournaments.

These expanded Masters 1000 events have received heavy criticism since they have started to become a big factor on tour.

This decision has particularly backfired on the men's tournament in Toronto this year, with Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz all withdrawing from the Canadian Open after having less time to recover from their exploits at Wimbledon.

After many consecutive weeks of competition without rest, I will not be able to play in Toronto this year. I have small muscles issues and I need to recover physically and mentally for what comes next. To the tournament and to my fans in Canada I am very sorry, I will see you…

This is not the only way that the tournament has suffered in the eyes of Shelton, who believes that the level of tennis is worse at 12-day Masters 1000 events where players have a day between matches.

“Did you say, “us mere mortals?” I'm a mere mortal, too,” Shelton said in his post-match press conference. “Yeah, like I said, I think that my game is well equipped to deal with these conditions, and it helps a lot of my weapons. But when you're not playing in these type of conditions throughout the year it can be difficult to adjust and find your range.

“I said that I was tired after Wimbledon, and if it was a different situation, maybe I wouldn't have played that 500 in Washington. But in DC, it's like my second home, and there's some advantages to getting more matches in these type of conditions and feeling more and more comfortable.

“The difficult part, you know, these two-week tournaments you're playing two-set matches, three-set matches, and you're getting a day off in between, which everyone talks about in the locker room now, the level of tennis suffers. The level is definitely higher in those one-week tournaments, when you're playing two out of three sets and you're playing back-to-back days and you get into a consistent rhythm of playing.

“It's tough with the start and stop, and I think that a combination of those things is probably what players are talking about and what's throwing a lot of guys off.”

The Canadian Open tournament directors have responded to criticism from players and revealed if they have plans to make changes in 2026.

There are nine Masters 1000 level tournaments on the ATP calendar in 2025, with seven of those now taking place over 12 days.

The only two that have not expanded are the Monte Carlo Masters and the Paris Masters, which are both still held over the traditional one week format.

Frances Tiafoe has also called out an issue with the Canadian Open this year, as the finals will take place on a Thursday instead of the traditional Sunday.

There will be no time for players to rest after the conclusion of the Canadian Open, as the Cincinnati Open begins on the same day as the finals in Toronto.

Shelton will be looking to be part of the final in Canada, but first he has his quarterfinal match with Washington Open champion Alex de Minaur.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

 Taylor Fritz battled into Monday morning before finally getting past Czech Jiri Lehecka with a 7-6 , 6-7 , 7-6 victory in three hours to reach the quarter-finals of the ATP Toronto Masters. 

 The US second seed finished off a complete matched set of Masters 1000 quarter-finals as the last piece of the puzzle fell into place in Canada. 

 The late-night marathon lasted 39 games without a break of serve, with 15 aggregate break points going begging. 

 Fritz delivered two aces in the final-set tiebreaker on his way to the narrow win, moving into the last eight as Lehecka drove long. 

 ""Making all the Masters quarters is really cool,"" Fritz said. ""It shows consistency. 

 ""Today I had to accept that parts of my game were just not there. I was bailed out by a lot of first serves, but I was making too many mistakes."" 

 Fellow American Ben Shelton earned a second chance after Flavio Cobillo failed to serve out their match, with the fourth seed finally securing a somewhat contentious 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 win. 

 The pair had words after the match, which Shelton characterised as nothing serious. 

 "" he made a gesture it was not directed at me so we are cool,"" Shelton said. 

 The winner, who now plays Alex de Minaur, earned his 100th ATP-level win after nearly two and a half hours, firing an ace on his second match point to wrap up a place in the last eight for a third straight tournament after Wimbledon and Washington. 

 ""It was a difficult match, I was down and out a break in the third set. But I gave myself a second chance. It was an absolute war not an easy one,"" Shelton said. 

 ""I was not hitting my spots on serve that well. I would do things differently. But coming through at the end speaks to my mental toughness and being scrappy."" 

 De Minaur pushed his ATP winning streak to seven matches as he fended off Frances Tiafoe 6-2, 4-6, 6-4,. 

 The Australian won the Washington title on Sunday before plunging into the chaotic schedule at Toronto, where play began on the weekend and will continue through Thursday. 

 De Minaur added his voice to the growing chorus of player complaints about the new 12-day Masters calendar, which will see play start in Cincinnati this week before Canada completes its unorthodox Thursday night final.

 The Australian said he wasn't helped by a third-round walkover which gave him three straight days off in the middle of the tournament. 

 ""I didn't enjoy having so much time. The body is used to going and going ,"" he said after ousting Tiafoe in just under two and a half hours. ""It was almost like it switched off, I had to focus to switch it back on. I had to tell myself I was still playing a tournament still competing. 

 ""I'm proud of the effort today."" 

 De Minaur has now beaten Tiafoe in three of four meetings. He profited from nearly 50 unforced errors off the American's racquet while overcoming a serving slump in the second set and early into the third. 

 ""It was never going to be easy. He has got the ability to switch it on whenever he wants. It was tricky to put him away,"" De Minaur said, adding that the hot, windy conditions made it even trickier. 

 ""I was just happy to sneak away with this win,"" he said after booking a seventh quarter-final of the season. 

 Sixth seed Andrey Rublev, runner-up last year when the tournament was held in Montreal, reached his 14th Masters quarter-final 6-7 , 7-6 , 3-0 when Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina was forced to retire with possible cramping. 

 Both men ended the battle with 37 unforced errors, with sixth seed Rublev to play Fritz for a semi-final spot.

In the weeks leading up to the tournament, Popyrin says he began to feel the pressure to defend his 1000 points from last year's win. Once he got to Toronto, though, he made peace with the possibility that he wouldn't succeed, and that helped him loosen up.“It's nice to come in here and kind of accept the fact that if you lose you don't save the 1,000 points,” Popyrin says. “It's just a nice feeling to just play free, and that's what I feel I've been doing this week.”Read more: Alexei Popyrin has now won seven of his last nine matches against Top 10 players

A post shared by Alexei Popyrin (@alexeipopyrin)

Popyrin has certainly shown more bedrock self-confidence than usual. Against Rune and Daniil Medvedev, two higher-ranked opponents, he dropped the first set, before gritting out the next two. Judging by his 15-16 record on the year, that's a surprise. But it really shouldn't be, because Popyrin, when he's on, has one of the best serve-forehand combinations in tennis.He'll likely need to be on against Zverev. The top seed is coming off a seemingly refreshing stint at the Rafa Nadal Academy after Wimbledon. More worrying for Popyrin, though, is their head-to-head: Zverev leads 3-0, and hasn't dropped a set in any of those matches.Still, two of those meetings were before 2020, and Popyrin has made more strides than Zverev in the years since. He has also been making the most of his looks at the right times in Toronto; he should get more of them against the defensive-minded German. Winner: Popyrin

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Ben Shelton explains reason for heated exchange with rival moments after win","https://talksport.com/tennis/3441649/ben-shelton-toronto-flavio-cobolli-argument-gesture-video/","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 08:28:19 GMT","





Ben Shelton was involved in a heated exchange with Flavio Cobolli after a fiery fourth-round match in Toronto.

The US star secured a 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 victory at the Masters 1000 event, before he approached the net to shake hands with his opponent.

But as they met, the pair appeared to get into a discussion over a gesture made by Cobolli during the third set tie-break, which Shelton thought was inappropriate.

They continued their exchange under the umpire's chair for a further 60 seconds, before the Italian eventually made his way off the court after finally shaking hands.

Shelton was later asked about what was said between the two players, and revealed they spoke about what had unfolded in the locker room too.

“Yeah, we talked about it. He said (the gesture) wasn't towards me,” the American, who is in a high-profile relationship with Trinity Rodman, explained.

“We're good. We talked about it in the locker room, so I'm not going to answer any more questions about that.

""There's no story, we're good, that's it, so, thanks.”

While the pair were able to talk through their issues, the tense on-court exchange soured what was a milestone night for Shelton.

The 22-year-old surged down the stretch and rallied from 3-5 down in the final set to secure his 100th tour-level win in Toronto.

Now 100-69 in his career, Shelton is just the eighth man born in the 21st century and the ninth active American to reach a century of wins.

He will next seek another milestone -- his first ATP Masters 1000 semi-final -- when he takes on Alex de Minaur later this week.

The result also saw Shelton level his head-to-head record with Cobolli at 2-2, having also picked up a win at the Mexican Open this season.

While he was eventually victorious in Canada, the World No. 7 struggled at times, with Cobolli limiting his explosive game as he took a lead in the deciding set.

But Shelton began to hit with confidence down the stretch and forced the Italian to save a match point just to reach the decisive tie-break.

He wrapped up victory with a third set tie-break for the second consecutive match.

Shelton, who last month exposed a Wimbeldon farce in 65 seconds, dispatched fellow American Brandon Nakashima before defeating Cobolli. 

""I thought I did a really good job rallying and finding a way to put returns in the court late,"" Shelton said.

""I was struggling with my two biggest weapons, the serve and the first-ball forehand.

""Coming through in the end I think speaks a lot about my mental toughness and my ability to be scrappy in those moments, more so than my actual play.""

Shelton will face De Minaur in his quarter-final match on Tuesday.

He has the opportunity to move above Novak Djokovic, to World No. 6, if he can win his third ATP Tour title this week.

The American is 16-7 this year on hard courts, a record that includes his run to the Australian Open semi-finals back in January.

Sunday's Round of 16 action in Toronto delivered the most dramatic day of the tournament so far, with all matches going the distance.

Taylor Fritz sealed a milestone by reaching his first Toronto quarter-final and completing the set of last-eight appearances at all nine Masters 1000 with a three-hour serving clinic against Jiri Lehecka.

Ben Shelton also had to go the distance, battling past Flavio Cobolli in a tiebreak-heavy war that featured explosive hitting, a saved match point, and even a post-match exchange over a gesture in the deciding breaker.

Cobolli might have had the cleaner level for stretches, but Shelton showed why he's one of the grittiest competitors on tour.

Meanwhile, Alex de Minaur continued his relentless 2025 form, outlasting Frances Tiafoe in three sets, and Andrey Rublev benefited from a mid-match retirement by Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, who had held match-point-level momentum but faded physically after losing the second-set breaker.

With eight players remaining, including three Americans, the field is wide open. Here's how it all unfolded on Day 8 at the National Bank Open.

Ben Shelton def. Flavio Cobolli, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6(1)

Ben Shelton staged a late comeback to notch his 100th tour-level win, outlasting Flavio Cobolli 6-4, 4-6, 7-6(1) in their National Bank Open fourth round.

Trailing 3-5 in the decider, the fourth-seeded American found his groove, dominating the tiebreak to level their head-to-head at 2-2.

Cobolli is a super athletic on court, and he was able to neutralise Shelton's explosive serve and forehand for much of the two-hour, 36-minute battle.

However, Shelton still plays like he's got his college teammates courtside cheering him on, and he showed plenty of determination, turning things around and even forcing the Italian to save a match point save before the tie break before unleashing clean hitting in the clutch to dominate the breaker.

There were some words at the end with Shelton confronting Cobolli about a gesture he'd made in the tiebreak, but it's hard to see how Shelton can be the annoyed one when he was roaring like he'd won the tournament on Cobolli's unforced errors.

Alex de Minaur def. Frances Tiafoe, 6-2, 4-6, 6-4

Alex de Minaur keeps on trucking as he battled past Frances Tiafoe 6-2, 4-6, 6-4. The Aussie was the 2023 Toronto finalist and has continued to win matches this season, consistently appearing in the latter rounds of any draw sheet.

De Minaur cruised early, but Tiafoe hit back, levelling with a forehand-fueled second set. The decider turned on a marathon point at 4-4, 40/40, with De Minaur breaking in the ninth game and serving out after two hours and 24 minutes.

Andrey Rublev def. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, 6-7(3), 7-6(2), 3-0 (Ret.)

Andrey Rublev survived an early scare to reach the Toronto quarter-finals, rallying from two points from defeat before Alejandro Davidovich Fokina retired at 6-7(3), 7-6(2), 3-0 due to mobility issues.

Davidovich Fokina has been in excellent form and held a 5-4, 30/0 lead in the second set but faded after failing to close.

Rublev pounced in the tiebreak and dominated early in the third before the No. 19's movement faltered. Was it that 11 am start in the last round? 😁

Taylor Fritz def. Jiri Lehecka, 7-6(4), 6-7(5), 7-6(5)

Taylor Fritz outlasted Jiri Lehecka 7-6(4), 6-7(5), 7-6(5) late on Sunday evening, securing his first Toronto quarter-final, and he has now reached at least the last eight at all nine ATP Masters 1000 events.

This three-tie break match saw ZERO breaks of serve, with Fritz saving all nine break points faced and Lehecka all five in a three-hour serving masterclass.

Both guys came close to breaking, wth Fritz escaping 0/40 at 5-6 in the first set and Lehecka clawing out of the same deficit at 0-1 in the third, but it was the American who got it done in he tie break, leaning on his first serve to progress.

Last season, GMP dominated the serving leaderboard, but this year, Fritz has topped the charts, winning 79.3% of his first serve points across the previous 52 weeks. He also boasts a super solid second serve. Can he leverage that stat to win some titles?

Thanks Jonathan, for keeping our interest in a tournament without those first-rate -warriors, you know what I mean.
I think Taylor Fritz has a good chance  this time. He really gave Alcaraz a good resistance in Wimbledon, so…
Amd I wish Rublev good luck anyway!

Pretty good round.  Thanks Jonathan.

Some good matches that I wished went the other way.  I was hoping for Lehecka, ADF and especially Cobolli.   Not a fan of Shelton's showboating.
Thanks for the write-ups!

Clara Tauson, world No. 19, continued the upsets at the Canadian Open in Montreal with a 7-6(1), 6-3 win over Wimbledon champion Iga Świątek in one hour and 53 minutes Sunday night. On Saturday, it was the world No. 2 and top seed Coco Gauff in straight sets to Canadian wild card Victoria Mboko. Sunday night, it was Świątek's turn to lose, unable to make the quarterfinals in her first tournament since winning her sixth slam.

“I think I'm getting more confidence in this kind of level and feeling like I belong here a bit more,” Tauson said. “I think that really helped me today in the important moments.”

Tauson launched to an early lead, converting on her first break point chance to go up 2-1. Świątek's inability to convert on the break points she faced defined the first set. Tauson saved seven of eight break-point opportunities, relying on her efficient serving to get out of trouble. At 3-2, a game where she saved four break points before holding, Tauson went after Świątek's forehand on one of the chances. The result was Świątek dumping the forehand in the net.

Attacking Świątek's forehand continued in the first set tiebreak. Instead of Świątek being patient on the return, a strategy she adopted during her championship run at Wimbledon, she elected to be more aggressive on the first swing. Świątek struggled to control the ball, leading to forehands in the net or sailing long. For the match, Świątek won just 24 percent (12-of-49) of points on Tauson's first serve.

The only point Świątek won in the tiebreak was a Tauson double fault. The world No. 3 returned the favor at 6-1, to give Tauson the tiebreak and the one-set advantage.

— wta (@WTA) August 4, 2025



Tauson played smart tennis in difficult, windy conditions for the duration of the match, keeping the ball in play and not beating herself. On Świątek's serve, Tauson was aggressive off the return, putting pressure immediately with blazing cross-court winners.

With Tauson up 2-1, Świątek fired two forehands in the middle of the net on consecutive points, leading to Tauson getting the break. Despite getting broken at 4-2, Tauson remained calm, and Świątek double-faulted on break point in the next game to give Tauson back her two-game cushion, as well as the opportunity to serve for the match.

Tauson said after the match that despite getting broken, she thought she was playing “the right way.”

“I felt like I had a bit better luck in my returning games, and obviously she started with a double fault in the next game, which gave me a little bit more confidence going into the rest of the points,” Tauson said. “I felt like I had a little bit of the upper hand in the end of the set. I think I showed that I can keep cool under pressure.”

At match point, Tauson won another short rally, thanks to a Świątek backhand in the net.

Tauson raised her arms, smiled to her team and let out a scream of celebration. She finally recorded her first career win against the world No. 3.

At Wimbledon, Świątek cruised to a straight-set win over Tauson en route to capturing the title but in Canada it was Tauson's turn, advancing to her second WTA 1000 quarterfinal of 2025. In February at the Dubai Tennis Championships, Tauson trounced world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in straight sets 6-3, 6-2, once again relying on a clutch serve — winning 80 percent of first serve points — and power from the baseline.

Next up for Tauson is the current Australian Open champion Madison Keys, who saved two match points en route to a thrilling three-set victory over Karolína Muchová, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5. The two met in the Auckland quarterfinal earlier this year, with Tauson winning in straight sets 6-4, 7-6.

Another quarterfinal showdown awaits in Canada.

Victoria Mboko has been one of the most successful rising stars of 2025.

Aged only 18, the Canadian has embarked on a string of big runs this season, starting with reaching the third round of her debut Grand Slam event at the French Open.

Now, Mboko is attracting further attention by reaching the last eight of a WTA 1000 event for the first time, on home soil at the Canadian Open.

After stunning world No 2 Coco Gauff in the round of 16, Mboko has cemented her place as one to watch in the future.

And, her rise is being masterminded by Nathalie Tauziat, a woman who has found success as both a player and a coach in recent decades.

One of the most accomplished French players of the Open Era, Tauziat found success in both singles and doubles across her career.

In a career that spanned almost two decades, Tauziat won eight WTA Tour titles and reached a further 14 finals, including at Wimbledon in 1998.

The French star shocked second seed Lindsay Davenport in the last eight and battled past Natasha Zvereva in the semi-final, before falling to Jana Novotna in the championship match.

Tauziat reached a further four quarter-finals at the All England Club and was a 1991 French Open and 2000 US Open quarter-finalist.

She called time on her singles career in 2001, having reached a career-high of world No 3 in 2000, with former world No 1 Amelie Mauresmo the only French woman ever to be ranked higher.

Tauziat also reached world No 3 in the doubles rankings, winning 25 tour-level titles and reaching a further 32 finals in her career.

She was a finalist alongside Kimberly Po at the 2001 US Open and reached a further six doubles Grand Slam semi-finals.

Towards the end of her doubles career in 2003, Tauziat took on a brief mentorship role with then-rising star Marion Bartoli, a future Wimbledon champion and top-10 player.

However, the 57-year-old has spent a large chunk of her coaching career working within Canadian tennis, guiding a range of rising Canadian stars.

Tauziat guided Eugenie Bouchard to the junior Wimbledon title in 2012 and also coached the Canadian to her first tour final at the 2013 Japan Women's Open, before parting ways at the end of the year.

She then worked with Aleksandra Wozniak for a short spell from the end of 2013, before turning her attention back towards working with an array of junior stars.

Tauziat helped guide Bianca Andreescu to the junior world No 1 ranking in 2017, just two years before Andreescu became the nation's first Grand Slam champion at the 2019 US Open.

The pair had parted ways in 2018, but Tauziat has remained a key figure in the Canadian setup and was part of the coaching team during Canada's historic Billie Jean King Cup triumph in 2023.

Her work with Mboko began at the start of 2025, with the 18-year-old having soared up the WTA Rankings since then.

Having been ranked outside of the top 300 when starting to work with Tauziat, Mboko is now comfortably inside the world's top 100.

The teen star won 22 straight matches and four consecutive ITF titles early on in 2025, and reached both the third round of Roland Garros and the second round of Wimbledon.

Speaking to Tennis Canada during her Grand Slam debut at the French Open in May, Mboko spoke about the impact Tauziat had on her career.

“I really love Nathalie,” said the 18-year-old.

“We have a lot of fun together and she's known me for a really long time. With Nathalie, it's very relaxed on court – she obviously has a lot of knowledge.

“The only thing is that she has so much knowledge that whenever I come at her…she's like: ‘here.' She's already there. She's really helped me and I'm grateful she's spending this time with me.”

Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek was the latest top player to suffer an upset in Montreal falling to Denmark's Clara Tauson as Naomi Osaka showed flashes of her past dominance.

Tauson gained revenge for her Wimbledon defeat at the hands of Swiatek to reach the last eight with a 7-6 (7-1) 6-3 victory.

Swiatek's loss came a day after top seed Coco Gauff was stunned in straight sets by Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko.

""It's tough conditions here with the wind but I tried my best to keep my head cool and keep working,"" Tauson said in her on-court interview.

""Even though I got broken in the second set, I was feeling confident and I'm really happy about the win.""

Poland's Swiatek won a solitary point in the first-set tiebreak - that came from a Tauson double fault - and was then broken early in the second set.

Swiatek broke back to make it 4-3 but failed to hold in her next service game as Tauson progressed to set up a quarter-final against Madison Keys.

The big-serving American saved two match points to emerge with a hard-fought 4-6 6-3 7-5 win over Czech Karolina Muchova.

Tauson won their only previous meeting in Auckland in January although Keys went on to capture her first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open later that month.

Former world No 1 Osaka showed flashes of her past dominance to reach the quarter-finals, needing just 49 minutes to steamroll Anastasija Sevastova 6-1 6-0.

It marks the first time the Japanese star has advanced to the last eight of a WTA 1000 event in 19 months, which came in Doha in 2024.

""I had a solid plan coming in here, and it happened to work out very well,"" said Osaka, who is working with Swiatek's former coach Tomasz Wiktorowski having parted ways with world-renowned Patrick Mouratoglou.

Osaka will face Elina Svitolina for a place in the semi-finals after the Ukrainian beat Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova 6-4 6-1.

In Toronto, fourth-seeded Ben Shelton rallied in the third set to beat 13th-seeded Flavio Cobolli 6-4 4-6 7-6 (7-1).

""Really difficult match. I was down and out, being a break down in the third, the way that he was playing,"" Shelton said.

""I gave myself a second chance and I did a good job with it, kind of running from there. A really difficult opponent for me, someone who's gotten me in three sets after I've won the first set twice.""

He will face ninth-seeded Alex de Minaur, a 6-2 4-6 6-4 winner over Frances Tiafoe.

Andrey Rublev advanced to the quarter-finals for the first time after Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina was forced to retire from the match with an injury while trailing 7-6 (7-3) 6-7 (2-7) 3-0.

On Monday afternoon, tennis fans received disheartening news. Novak Djokovic has officially withdrawn from the 2025 Cincinnati Open. It is the second consecutive year Djokovic has missed the event.

Not only is the Cincinnati Open the seventh ATP Masters 1000 event of the season, but it is the final test of the North American hard court swing before the US Open.

That means Djokovic will not have any matches between his semifinal loss to Jannik Sinner at Wimbledon (July 11) and the main draw of the US Open (August 24).

This is not the first time this season that Djokovic has taken an unusual approach to his scheduling in order to give his body the right balance of rest, recovery, and training.

Before Wimbledon, Djokovic acknowledged that the grass court Major gave him the best and possibly final shot at a 25th Grand Slam title. After losing to Sinner, Djokovic alluded that those chances were now severely diminished.

Djokovic is currently the World No. 6 with a record of 26-9 with one singles title. His lone championship came earlier in May at the Geneva Open, which helped him reach 100 career singles titles.

Emma Raducanu is facing the prospect of heading into the US Open unseeded after her heavy defeat in Montreal. It was shaping up to be another positive tournament run for the Brit, who made it to the semi-finals in Washington just over a week ago, but her outing at the Canadian Open was ended abruptly by Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova.

After breezing past Elena-Gabriela Ruse and Peyton Stearns in the first two rounds, Raducanu was thrashed 6-2 6-1 by fifth seed Anisimova on Saturday. The result, and those of her tennis rivals, have seen Raducanu drop down to 38th in the WTA's live rankings.

She went into the Canadian Open ranked 33rd - a healthy position from which to break into the top 32 and bank herself a vital seeding for the US Open later this month. A seeding would guarantee that Raducanu avoids meeting the very best players in the early rounds of the year's final Grand Slam at Flushing Meadows.

But the 22-year-old is now six places off where she needs to be, with Naomi Osaka, Xinyu Wang and Dayana Yastremska all moving up amid strong showings in Montreal.

The pressure is now on Raducanu to bank ranking points at the upcoming WTA 1000 event in Cincinnati. Realistically, a run to the round of 16 is the minimum she needs to break into the top 32.



One of the benefits for Raducanu is that she has no ranking points to defend leading up to the US Open. She did not play any warm-up tournaments in preparation for last year's trip to New York so WTA events in Cleveland or Monterrey could be opportunities for her to make ground.

It remains to be seen whether the Brit and her camp prioritise a seeding or staying fresh after last year's debacle, when Raducanu was knocked out in the first round of the US Open by Sofia Kenin before admitting to flaws in her scheduling in a teary press conference.

""I feel down, I feel sad,"" said the 2021 US Open champion. ""Obviously, this is a tournament I really want to do well in. I was maybe a bit slow starting. Yeah, I would have preferred to probably play a little bit more before coming into the US Open.

""You know, I know when I have a lot of matches, just like every player, you feel really good. You feel like everything's automatic. So yeah, I think I can learn from it and manage my schedule slightly differently.""

The ATP has announced that the ATP 250 tournament in Belgrade, Serbia, will relocate to Athens, Greece, this year from 2-8 November.

The Hellenic Championship will be played on indoor hard court at OAKA Basketball Arena, a multi-purpose venue that was used for the 2004 Olympics and has played host to musical events including the Eurovision Song Contest.

Tournament organisers stated: ""ATP 250 Hellenic Championship is organised by the experienced team behind nine previous international tournaments in Belgrade. This latest project builds on that legacy, with preparations well underway to deliver a world-class event in the historic city of Athens.

""We look forward to welcoming the tennis world to Greece this November.""

It looked as if Ben Shelton would be made to wait for his 100th tour-level win after falling behind 3-5 in the final set against Flavio Cobolli Sunday night at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers. But the American, who had not created a break point since the last game of the opening set, surged down the stretch and sprinted through the finish line for a 6-4, 4-6, 7-6(1) victory.

Now 100-69 in his tour-level career, Shelton is the eighth man born in the 21st century and the ninth active American to reach the 100-wins mark. He will next seek another milestone — his first ATP Masters 1000 semi-final — when he takes on Alex de Minaur in his fourth quarter-final at the prestigious level.



""Really difficult match. I was down and out, being a break down in the third, the way that he was playing,"" Shelton said post-match. ""I gave myself a second chance and I did a good job with it, kind of running from there. A really difficult opponent for me, someone who's gotten me in three sets after I've won the first set twice.""

The result levelled the Lexus ATP Head2Head between the friends at 2-2, with Shelton also earning a 7-6(4), 7-6(4) win in Acapulco this season. Cobolli succeeded for much of the match in limiting Shelton's explosive game and dragging the American into rallies, but Shelton began to hit with confidence down the stretch and forced the Italian to save a match point just to reach the decisive tie-break.

""I thought I did a really good job rallying and finding a way to put returns in the court late in the match. I was struggling with my two biggest weapons, the serve and the first-ball forehand,"" Shelton said. ""Coming through in the end I think speaks a lot about my mental toughness and my ability to be scrappy in those moments, more so than my actual play.""

Shelton is into his third consecutive quarter-final after reaching that stage at Wimbledon and advancing to the semis last week in Washington, D.C. He is 16-7 this year on hard courts, including his run to the Australian Open semi-finals.

Cobolli was denied the biggest win of his career by PIF ATP Ranking against the World No. 7. The Italian was seeking his first Top 10 win in a completed match, having beaten then-No. 9 Holger Rune via retirement in Madrid this April.

Shelton, who entered Toronto at a career-high in the PIF ATP Rankings, could move above Novak Djokovic to World No. 6 by winning his third ATP Tour title this week.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Tie-break marathon: Fritz edges Lehecka without a single break","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/fritz-lehecka-toronto-2025-sunday","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 06:33:45 GMT","

The National Bank Open Presented by Rogers saved the best for last on a bumper Sunday that saw all four men's singles matches go into a deciding set.

In the Toronto nightcap, Taylor Fritz edged Jiri Lehecka 7-6(4), 6-7(5), 7-6(5) in a dramatic match in which neither player lost a service game. Across nearly three hours, Fritz saved all nine break points against him while Lehecka saved five, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Fritz escaped 0/40 at 5-6 in the opening set before Lehecka dug out of the same hole at 0-1 in the third set. After fighting off a final break point to hold for 4-3 in the decider, the American closed out the victory by winning five of the last six points from 2/4 in the deciding tie-break, improving to 4-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

While Fritz struggled at times to find the court with his aggressive game, finishing with 48 errors, he found a way through to the quarter-finals behind a stellar serving day.

""I think just in the end [it was about] really accepting what was there for me tonight,"" said the American, who won 82 per cent of his first-serve points. ""Luckily for me, I was serving really, really well tonight. He was too. 

""When it came down to that tie-break, I really bailed myself out with a lot of first serves, and then just trying to put balls in the court and not try any shots that, despite how badly I wanted to try to be aggressive, just be disciplined and just make the balls that I felt like I could make.""



The victory completed the box set of ATP Masters 1000 quarter-finals for Fritz, who is through to that stage in Canada for the first time. He is the 11th active player to reach the quarters at all nine Masters 1000s.

""It's really cool,"" said Fritz. ""It shows the consistency on all the different tournaments and surfaces. I guess what's next is to go for semis."" Fritz has reached the semis in six of the nine Masters 1000s, all but Rome, Cincinnati and Paris.

Fritz is also the fourth man to register 35 wins (35-13) this season. He also owns an 18-3 mark since June, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, highlighted by titles in Stuttgart and Eastbourne and a run to the Wimbledon semi-finals. The No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings leads all active American men with 319 tour-level wins overall, ahead of Frances Tiafoe's 232 in second.

Next up for Fritz is a quarter-final showdown against sixth seed Andrey Rublev on Tuesday.

But they've given themselves a chance for something better in Montreal. In their round of 16 matches, both lost close firsts to fairly in-form opponents—Dayana Yastremska in Rybakina's case, McCartney Kessler in Kostyuk's—before coming back to win. Kostyuk, in fact, has gone the distance in all three of her wins, so she shouldn't be fazed if she falls behind again.These two have played three times, and Rybakina has won two of those matches, including the most recent, in 2024. She also made the semis in Montreal in 2023, and has the more powerful game and penetrating strokes. She'll be able to get in the first strike most of the time, and the match will likely be on her racquet. Kostyuk will surely scrap to the end, but Rybakina has the weapons to make it a futile effort.

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

The Hungarian Grand Prix started in promising fashion for Charles Leclerc but ended in disappointment, the Monegasque having slipped backwards to P4.

Charles Leclerc has explained the problems behind his “extremely frustrating” drop-off in pace during the Hungarian Grand Prix, with the Monegasque – who had started from pole position – slipping backwards to fourth on a day where he had hoped to take a victory.

The race had started off well for Leclerc, having held the lead before also managing to keep McLaren's Oscar Piastri behind him during the first round of pit stops.

However, after Lando Norris put himself ahead of both via an alternative strategy, Leclerc looked to be struggling in the latter stages of the race and was soon overtaken by Piastri for second place.

The Ferrari driver then faced a challenge from George Russell in a battle for third and, as well as losing another position to the Mercedes driver, found himself with a five-second time penalty for driving erratically during the battle.

After crossing the line in P4, Leclerc cut a downbeat figure as he discussed what had happened to cause his lack of pace later on, with the issue turning out to be different to what the 27-year-old had initially thought.

“From around Lap 40 we had a problem with the chassis, so now I've had more details about it,” said Leclerc. “In the car obviously I had no idea what was going on. I mean I had an idea, but it was a wrong idea because I thought it was something that was in our control.

“Unfortunately we had an issue on the chassis, so I don't have much to add on that. It's just extremely frustrating when you are fighting for a win and when we had the pace that we had at the beginning of the race, and we lose absolutely everything later on, it's very frustrating.”

With the race bringing the first part of the season to a close, Leclerc was quizzed on what his mindset now is as the sport heads into its traditional summer break.

“Very disappointed,” he conceded. “I don't take any positives from this weekend when we ended the weekend like that.

“When we have one opportunity in a year to win a race, we need to take it and today we didn't. Now we will analyse what are the reasons why we had this problem. I don't think it's anything that we had in our control, but we'll check.”

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Lando Norris emerged triumphant in the Hungarian Grand Prix, the McLaren man beating team mate Oscar Piastri to take the victory.

Lando Norris has won the Hungarian Grand Prix after holding off a thrilling late-race challenge for the lead from McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri, the Briton having made an alternative strategy work in his favour to take victory.

Polesitter Charles Leclerc had made a strong start to hold P1 when the race got underway, allowing the Ferrari driver to build up a steady lead over Piastri in P2 during the opening stages of the race – a position he maintained amid the first round of pit stops, despite Piastri's attempt to undercut his rival.

However, the picture started to evolve as different strategies played out amongst the frontrunners, with Leclerc and Piastri – both on two-stop plans – finding themselves behind the one-stopping Norris in the final phase of the race.

While Leclerc's pace fell away in the latter stages, a fast Piastri set about chasing down Norris for the lead – leading to a gripping conclusion as the Australian was hot on the tail of his team mate in the final laps.

Race results

FORMULA 1 LENOVO HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

Despite a couple of attempts, Piastri could not find a way past the other McLaren, with Norris crossing the line just 0.698s ahead to seal his fifth win of the season. This has cut Piastri's lead in the Drivers' Championship down to nine points entering into the summer break.

George Russell took third for Mercedes, having overtaken a struggling Leclerc to claim the final spot on the podium. Leclerc had to settle for fourth on a disappointing day for the Monegasque, who also received a five-second time penalty for driving erratically during his battle with Russell.

Fernando Alonso put in a solid drive to claim fifth for Aston Martin, marking a valuable double points finish for the squad with Lance Stroll not far behind in seventh. Between them was Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto, marking another eye-catching performance from the rookie.

Liam Lawson was eighth for Racing Bulls, followed by the Red Bull of Max Verstappen who had a tricky day in ninth. The Dutchman faced an investigation after the race for an incident with Lewis Hamilton that saw the Ferrari man go wide, but no further action was taken and he kept his P9 finish.

Kimi Antonelli took the final point on offer in P10 for Mercedes, while Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar just missed out in P11. Also outside of the top 10 was Hamilton, who had to settle for P12 on a tough weekend for the seven-time World Champion.

Nico Hulkenberg placed in 13th for Kick Sauber, followed by the Williams pair of Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon in 14th and 15th respectively. Esteban Ocon was the sole Haas to finish the race in 16th, with Yuki Tsunoda behind in 17th for Red Bull.

It was a difficult day for Alpine, as Franco Colapinto and Pierre Gasly completed the order down in P18 and P19, the latter having received a 10-second time penalty for causing a collision with Sainz.

Ollie Bearman, meanwhile, failed to make the chequered flag, with damage to his Haas forcing him to retire from the running.

After the dust had settled amid a surprise ending to Saturday's Qualifying at the Hungaroring – with Leclerc outpacing the McLaren duo to grab an unexpected pole position – attentions shifted to Sunday's 70-lap Hungarian Grand Prix, the final race before F1's traditional summer break.

In the wake of that eventful grid-deciding session, one change had been made to the starting order during the build-up to race day. It was confirmed that Tsunoda would be required to start from the pit lane, due to Red Bull having replaced power unit elements in his car – as well as changing the brake cooling configuration – under parc ferme conditions.

While rain had fallen in Budapest earlier on Sunday, the drivers were greeted by dry, gusty and slightly cooler conditions as the start time neared, with a 20 per cent chance of rainfall predicted during the race.

When the tyre blankets were removed once the cars had assembled on the grid for the anticipated two-stop event, it was revealed that the majority of the field would start on the medium compound, the exceptions being Sainz, Hulkenberg and Albon on the softs, and Hamilton and Gasly running the hards.

Once the formation lap had been completed and the lights went out, Leclerc made a good launch off the line to hold the lead into Turn 1, while Norris attempted to move down the inside of Piastri but, after braking early, allowed Russell to slip through into third.

There was further trouble for Norris as Alonso soon snatched P4, pushing the Briton down to fifth. Elsewhere, Verstappen had lost a place to former team mate Lawson – only to retake it later in the lap – while Stroll had dropped backwards to seventh.

As Lap 3 ticked down, Norris swept past Alonso on the main straight to get himself back up to fourth. Verstappen, meanwhile, was also on the move, the Dutchman having overtaken Stroll for P7 before starting to chase down Bortoleto up ahead for sixth – a driver noted by Race Control for a potential false start.

Hulkenberg was the first to pit on Lap 6, the Kick Sauber driver swapping his soft tyres for a set of mediums. Like his team mate, the German driver had also been noted for a possible false start. Elsewhere, up at the front, Leclerc had built a lead of nearly three seconds from Piastri, with Norris trying to catch Russell for fourth while Alonso was heading a DRS train in fifth.

Hadjar – who had lost a place earlier on to Bearman – seemed to be in some discomfort, the Frenchman reporting that his hand had been hit by gravel flicked up from the car ahead during the opening lap.

There was bad news for Hulkenberg, the German having received a five-second penalty for that false start, while no further action was taken in regards to Bortoleto. Up ahead, questions were started to emerge over strategy as the race headed towards Lap 10, with Piastri asked about the possibility of a one-stop race.

""Difficult to know with so many laps to go,” the Australian responded. Team mate Norris, meanwhile, was told that he needed to get past Russell, the McLaren having found himself stuck behind the Mercedes. Others struggling to overtake included Hamilton, the Ferrari man running close to Antonelli in a battle for 13th.

As Lap 15 arrived, Leclerc was now ahead of Piastri by just over three seconds, while others further back were starting to make pit stops, including Colapinto, Albon and Ocon. Sainz was the next to swap his soft tyres for the hards, but the frontrunning cars showed no signs of pitting yet.

Piastri, meanwhile, was encourage to push – and subsequently started to eat into Leclerc's advantage, the gap down to 2.3s by Lap 18. On the same tour, Verstappen was the first in the top 10 to pit, the Red Bull man emerging with hard tyres on in an attempt to undercut Alonso and Bortoleto.

Another driver trying an undercut was Piastri, having been told “box to overtake Leclerc”. The McLaren emerged back on track between Alonso and Bortoleto – while Leclerc made his own pit stop for the hard compound shortly afterwards.

Leclerc returned to the track still ahead of Piastri, with that lap having seemingly not been enough for the Australian to warm up his tyres. However, the McLaren team radioed in to warn that Leclerc may struggle with the same issue on his own out-lap.

Norris, meanwhile, had inherited the lead after remaining out on track, while Piastri had overtaken Alonso – yet to pit – for P3. The situation for Norris posed some interesting strategy questions, with the Briton asked about the possibility of Plan A and Plan B. Would the squad attempt a one-stop?

McLaren were not the only ones keeping a driver out on track. Alonso – still running his medium starting tyre – lost P4 to Russell on Lap 26, while Verstappen – one of the early stoppers – reported that his own strategy had been a “really terrible idea”, having spent much of the race since in traffic as he tried to make gains from P12.

As the Dutchman set about chasing down former title rival Hamilton for 11th place, Piastri was questioning whether a one-stop strategy could work, leading to the response that it could prove difficult. On the other side of the garage, Norris was asked for his thoughts on doing a one-stop himself, to which he responded: “Yeah, why not!”

“I can feel what we discussed before the race,” Leclerc cryptically reported, before going on to state that the issue would cause the Scuderia to “lose this race”. The Monegasque was running some 1.6s ahead of Piastri with 40 laps remaining.

Further back, Verstappen boldly moved down the inside of Hamilton into Turn 4 to take P11, with the Ferrari subsequently going wide – an incident that was noted by Race Control. Elsewhere, Norris pitted on Lap 32 for the hard tyres on a rapid 1.9s stop, bringing him back out on track in P4 ahead of Alonso.

As the race reached its halfway point, Leclerc was leading Piastri by just under two seconds, with Russell running in third some eight seconds ahead of Norris. Alonso, Bortoleto, Stroll and Lawson were all still to pit in fifth to eighth respectively, while Verstappen and Hamilton rounded out the top 10.

Stroll was the first Aston Martin to pit on Lap 37, returning to the track with the hard tyres bolted on. Elsewhere, Norris was looking fast as he tried to chase down Russell, the Briton dipping a wheel as he pushed hard. This charge had brought his distance to the leaders down to just 13.9s by Lap 40.

Shortly afterwards, Leclerc made another pit stop for a second set of the hard rubber, bringing him back out in fourth around seven seconds behind Norris. Piastri – now in the lead – was subsequently told to push, the Australian now leading by 9.2s from Russell.

While the stewards confirmed that the earlier incident between Verstappen and Hamilton would be investigated after the race, the former – running in P5 – was informed that Red Bull were considering keeping him on a one-stop strategy. “It's not going to be easy,” the Dutchman reported.

With Russell pitting for the hard compound – and returning to the track in fourth – Norris had been promoted to second and was now 8.7s away from his team mate. As Lap 46 ticked down, Piastri dived into the pits and rejoined in third, five seconds back from Leclerc in P2 and a further 12s adrift of new leader Norris. Could Piastri or Leclerc catch the Briton before the chequered flag?

As the race moved towards the final 20 laps, Verstappen could not hold out any longer on his medium tyres and pitted for a set of hards, bringing him back out into P9 just ahead of Antonelli. Piastri, meanwhile, had caught Leclerc and made a move into Turn 1 to snatch P2 from the Ferrari.

Elsewhere, Bearman became the first retiree from the race, the Haas driver having reported that his car was “broken” after struggling for grip.  It also seemed to be turning into a tough day for Leclerc, who voiced his frustration about his SF-25 being “undriveable” before suggesting that a podium finish would be a “miracle”.

The Monegasque's position did indeed look to be at risk, with Russell closing the gap down to 3.1s with 15 laps to go. Up ahead, Piastri was now 5.6s away from Norris and lapping quickly – setting up a thrilling conclusion to the race.

By Lap 60 of 70, that gap had come down to 3.3s – while Russell was mere tenths away from a struggling Leclerc in the scrap for third. The Silver Arrows driver looked at making a lunge into Turn 1, only for Leclerc to cover him off.

“That was moving under braking!” an irritated Russell complained. The Briton was warned to keep cool – and seemed to do so when he repeated the move at the same place one lap later. This time he made it stick, though was still left unhappy with Leclerc's defensive moves on track in an incident that was set to be investigated by the stewards.

As the stewards also put Gasly and Sainz under investigation for a collision at Turn 2 – leading to a 10-second penalty for Gasly – all eyes were on the battle at the front. With six laps to go, Piastri was only 1.2s behind Norris – just as the leader was approaching traffic to lap in the form of Hamilton, Hadjar and Antonelli.

After clearing those cars, the gap had dropped to just 0.6s as the final two laps approached. A late lunge on Lap 69 failed to pay off for Piastri, who locked up and just missed his team mate. “Remember how we go racing,” the 24-year-old was warned.

With one more attempt remaining, Piastri ultimately was too far back to make a move on the final tour – meaning that Norris crossed the line to take victory by 0.698s from his team mate and in the process cutting Piastri's lead in the World Championship down to just nine points.

Russell completed the podium in third place, while Leclerc held onto fourth despite being handed a five-second time penalty for driving erratically during his scrap with Russell. Alonso took a season-best fifth, while Bortoleto – a driver managed by the Spaniard – followed in sixth.

Stroll completed a good day for Aston Martin in P7, while Lawson, Verstappen and Antonelli completed the top 10. Verstappen, however, will still need to visit the stewards post-race for that earlier incident with Hamilton.

Hadjar claimed 11th place ahead of Hamilton in 12th, followed by Hulkenberg in 13th and the Williams duo of Sainz and Albon in 14th and 15th respectively.

Ocon placed in P16, with Tsunoda facing another tough outing behind in P17, while Alpine ended a difficult day with Colapinto in P18 from Gasly in the last classified position.

Bearman proved to be the only retiree of the race in F1's final outing before the sport embarks on a summer break.

""I'm dead, I'm dead,"" joked Norris as he reflected on his race. ""It was tough, it was tough. We weren't really planning on the one-stop at the beginning, but after the first lap it was kind of our only option to get back into things. It was tough. The final stint with Oscar catching, I was pushing flat-out. My voice has gone a little bit. But good, rewarding even more because of that – the perfect result today.""

F1 will now embark on its traditional summer break before returning for the Dutch Grand Prix on the weekend of August 29-31. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

Radio Rewind: 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Lando Norris held off a charging Oscar Piastri to take victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix, while the race ended in disappointment for polesitter Charles Leclerc.

In the last race before F1 embarks on its summer break, the Hungarian Grand Prix offered up plenty of talking points to tide us over until the racing returns.

While Charles Leclerc had taken an impressive pole position, it was ultimately Lando Norris who claimed victory following an alternative strategy in Sunday's race – though it didn't necessarily come easily, having faced a thrilling challenge for the lead from team mate Oscar Piastri in the closing stages.

From those nail-biting battles on track through to all of the happenings off the circuit, here's our round-up of the highlights from an eventful weekend in Budapest…

At the beginning of the Hungarian Grand Prix, it appeared as if McLaren may have to settle for a 2-3 result at best; Piastri was running in second place, with polesitter Leclerc managing to hold a steady lead, while Norris had lost two positions off the line.

However, that picture would evolve dramatically as the 70-lap encounter played out. While Piastri and Leclerc opted for two-stop strategies, Norris took a gamble on a one-stop call – a decision that seemed to work out well for the Briton, who eventually found himself ahead of both of his rivals.

While Leclerc slipped backwards as the race entered its latter stages (more on which below), Piastri was looking quick on fresher rubber than his team mate – and promptly started to eat into Norris' lead as the laps ticked down.

This led to an epic scrap for victory in the dying moments, with Piastri making more than one attempt to pass the other papaya car – with one of these seeing him lock up and only narrow miss making contact with Norris.

As it was, Norris held on to seal a fifth win of the campaign, a result that has helped him to close the gap to Piastri at the top of the Drivers' Championship down to just nine points entering into the summer break.

The final spot on the podium was claimed by George Russell, who won out in a feisty battle with Leclerc to claim P3 and take Mercedes' first rostrum since the Canadian Grand Prix back in June.

It was certainly a case of dramatic highs and lows for Leclerc during the weekend at the Hungaroring. The Monegasque caught everyone – including himself – by surprise when he grabbed pole position in Saturday's Qualifying session, outpacing both McLarens in the process.

With a possible first Grand Prix win of the season on the table for Ferrari, Leclerc's chances of achieving this appeared good at the start of Sunday's event, the eight-time race winner chalking up a decent lead from Piastri in the opening stages.

But as the race moved into its second half, that early pace looked to be dropping off for Leclerc. After being overtaken by Piastri, he lost out on the final spot on the podium to Russell – and also received a five-second time penalty for driving erratically during that battle.

Speaking afterwards, Leclerc confirmed that the issue had been down to the chassis – a cause that he admitted was different to the one he had thought it to be during his frustrated radio messages in the race.

While this was beyond his control, the 27-year-old conceded that he would enter the summer break “very disappointed” after losing out on both a rostrum and an opportunity to win. And on the other side of the garage, Lewis Hamilton seemed equally downbeat following a challenging weekend in Budapest.

Having qualified down in P12 in Saturday's Qualifying – after which he called himself “absolutely useless” – the seven-time World Champion ended Sunday's race in the same position, leading him to declare afterwards: “I'm glad it's over.”

Aston Martin enjoyed their best race weekend of the 2025 season at the Hungaroring, with Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll securing fifth and seventh respectively at the chequered flag.

It marked a remarkable turnaround for the British team, having been at the back of the grid just one week ago in Belgium, with the result moving them from P8 to P6 in the Teams' Championship ahead of Kick Sauber and Racing Bulls.

""We really needed this result. Spa last week we were at the bottom of the list and now we are P5 and P7,"" said Alonso, who managed to reach the finish on a one-stop strategy after holding onto his fifth-place starting position.

""We need to learn what is the difference between the two tracks, what we did different to the car and try to apply those learnings into the next race.""

Kick Sauber increased their impressive run of point-scoring finishes to six races, this time courtesy of Gabriel Bortoleto who came home sixth – his best result in Formula 1 to date.

The Brazilian rookie claimed an impressive seventh on the grid, out-qualifying four-time World Champion Max Verstappen, and ran ahead of the Dutchman and behind manager Alonso in the early stages before utilising a one-stop strategy to keep P6.

""We did an amazing job, the team gave me an amazing car for today's race,” said Bortoleto, who has scored points three times in the last four races. “We managed to put everything in place.

“The strategy was great. I don't see how we could finish this half of the season better.”

While the title battle in Formula 1 between Piastri and Norris will continue to rage after the summer break, the crown in Formula 3 has already been decided in favour of Rafael Camara.

The Ferrari Academy Driver claimed the accolade with a round to spare having taken an impressive victory in a wet Feature Race at the Hungaroring, his fourth win of the campaign for Trident.

""I'm very happy. All the hard work we did all season has paid off, so super happy,"" said the 20-year-old Brazilian, who has taken back-to-back titles after his success in the Formula Regional European Championship by Alpine in 2024.

""It's a time where we can finally relax a bit because all season, regardless of if you are losing or if you're winning, you always keep working hard.""

After nearly four decades of hosting the Hungarian Grand Prix, the Hungaroring got a host of shiny new upgrades to modernise parts of the venue, from the media centre to the paddock facility.

Think 20 garages are enough to hold an F1 race? This track is now close to offering 40, with 36 available to teams and four reserved for technical services.

If that doesn't impress, maybe the stylish rooftop terrace, sleek VIP area or updated commentary booths will!

While the building work will continue into 2026 to celebrate 40 years of Grands Prix in Budapest, the revamped 10,000 capacity grandstand helped the organisers to sell out Sunday's race and encourage those watching at home to add the Hungaroring to their list of must-visit tracks.

Your best bet for celeb spotting in F1 would typically be in Monaco or Las Vegas, but Hungary was far from lacking when it came to star power.

Anya Taylor-Joy was seen in the Ferrari garage for the second time in three races, while fellow actor Jamie Dornan got the chance to pay McLaren a visit and watch their drivers secure a mighty 1-2 finish.

The honour of waving the chequered flag went to legendary Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose as Norris narrowly beat Piastri to the race victory, but perhaps the real winner off-track was Haas' Esteban Ocon.

A massive Marvel fanboy (he's previously rocked both Deadpool and Captain America helmets), he was in for a treat as he met Captain America himself, Anthony Mackie, on Saturday.

Radio Rewind: 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

The McLaren pair nearly came together in the Hungarian Grand Prix, but Oscar Piastri eventually had to settle for second.

Oscar Piastri admits that overtaking Lando Norris was always going to be ""much easier said than done"" as he had to settle for second in the Hungarian Grand Prix, with his Drivers' Championship lead trimmed to just nine points.

The Australian came just fractions away from adding another victory to his tally for the 2025 campaign ahead of the summer break, having closed a 12s gap to leader Norris in the closing stages.

With fresher hard tyres courtesy of a two-stop strategy as opposed to Norris' one-stop, Piastri directly challenged his team mate in the final three laps but had to settle for second.

""I pushed as hard as I could. I think after I saw Lando going for a one [stop], I knew I was going to have overtake on track, which is much easier said than done around here,"" said Piastri.

""I tried a few things, it was a gamble either way, and today unfortunately we were just on the wrong side of it. The team did a great job, the car really came alive in the second half of the race, and the car's been great all weekend – thank you to the team. I'm looking forward to a couple of weeks off.""

Piastri looked to move into the lead over the final laps primarily at Turn 1 and came just inches away from hitting his team mate having locked-up on the penultimate lap.

But the Australian admitted that he was never realistically close enough to pass around a circuit where overtaking proved difficult all day.

""I think I needed to be at least a couple of tenths closer, which was going to take a mistake from Lando to achieve that,"" said Piastri.

""I felt like that was going to be my best chance. You never want to try and save it for the next lap and then it never comes, so I thought I would at least try. Not quite.""

Piastri found himself behind Norris having made an early first stop after being stuck behind polesitter Charles Leclerc in the opening phase.

Having been unable to undercut the Ferrari driver, Piastri eventually moved ahead after both had made a second pit stop but fell short of repassing Norris on the alternative strategy.

""Yes and no,"" said Piastri when asked if he was surprised Norris had opted for a one-stop strategy.

""At that point he didn't really have much to lose. It wasn't a huge surprise. I don't know if trying to undercut Leclerc was the right call in the end, but we can go through it after.""

Radio Rewind: 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri and George Russell face the press after the 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix from the Hungaroring, Budapest.

1. Lando Norris (McLaren), 2. Oscar Piastri (McLaren), 3. George Russell (Mercedes)

TRACK INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by James Hinchcliffe)

Q: And for the ninth time in his career, Lando Norris is your winner here in Hungary. Lando, just talk to us about that last stint, battling with Oscar Piastri, your teammate. It came so close there but you held him off.

Lando NORRIS: Yeah. I'm dead. It was tough. We weren't really planning on the one-stop at the beginning but after the first lap it was kind of our only option to get back into things. It was tough. The final stint with Oscar catching, I was pushing flat out. My voice has gone a little bit. Pretty good, rewarding even more because of that, but the perfect result today.

Q: You mentioned how it wasn't the original plan, but after that first lap, you fell back to fifth. When they came on the radio and said, ""Hey, what do you think about a one-stop?"" you almost sounded indifferent. You said, ""Yeah, sure, let's give it a try."" At what point did it really start feeling like you could pull off this win?

LN: I mean, I didn't think it would probably get us the win. I thought maybe it would get us at least into second. I knew our pace was good, even in the first stint behind George. I couldn't get past, but the pace was strong. So, I knew if I just had some clean air and I could push that I could maybe make things work, and that's what we did. It's always a bit of a gamble, these kinds of things, but it also requires no mistakes, good laps, good strategy, all these things. And that's what we had today. So, I'm very happy.

Q: You've managed to close the championship gap down a little bit heading into that summer break. How much of a relief is it now to take this time off knowing that momentum is kind of on your side right now?

LN: I think it's so tightly fought, it's hard to say if momentum's on anyone's side, but we're fighting hard. It's fun. It's tough but fun racing against Oscar and great for us as a team. Another one-two. Our 200th win actually in Formula 1. Credit to Oscar, he put up a good charge and I just about held on. I look forward to plenty more of these.

Q: Marvellous final stint. Congratulations on the win.

LN: Thank you so much.

Q: Alright, Oscar. I know no driver likes coming second place in a race. You came from 12 seconds back after that second stop. Just walk us through that final stint, tracking down Lando, and then ultimately that attempt with two to go down to turn one.

Oscar PIASTRI: Yeah. I pushed as hard as I could. I think after I saw Lando going for a one-stop I knew I was going to have to overtake on track, which is much easier said than done around here. Tried a few things. It was a gamble either way and today, unfortunately, we were just on the wrong side of it. The team did a great job. The car really came alive in the second half of the race and has been great all weekend. So, thank you to the team and looking forward to a couple weeks off.

Q: Were you surprised when you got the call from the team that Lando would switch to the one-stop?

OP: Yes and no. At that point, he didn't really have much to lose, so it wasn't a huge surprise. I don't know if trying to undercut Leclerc was the right call in the end, but we can go through it after.

Q: Is it easy to look at it now and think maybe you tried that move in Turn 1 a lap too early? Or do you think you pulled it off with the best chance you could?

OP: I think I needed to be at least a couple of tenths closer, which was going to take a mistake from Lando to achieve that. I feel like that was going to be my best chance. You never want to try and save it for the next lap and then it never comes. So, I thought I would at least try and, yeah, not quite.

Q: You got a smile on your face. Obviously, you still had some fun out there. Congratulations.

OP: Thank you.

Q: George Russell coming home P3 today. George, I think after practice, you've got to say that it looked like Mercedes was third best team. So, are you pretty proud coming home with the podium today?

George RUSSELL: Yeah. Really happy with the race today. Obviously, yesterday qualifying was a bit of a surprise. This whole weekend's been a bit surprising for everyone, but so happy to be back on the podium.

Q: It was a bit dicey with Charles at some point. Walk us through that battle a little bit. We saw some close moments, some radio banter back and forth. How did you see it from your seat?

GR: It's one of those where you sort of commit to a bit of a dive bomb. If the driver in front moves, you're already right on the limit of grip and there's not much room for manoeuvre. I think we made contact on the second time, but just glad to get through it. Nice way to go into the break.

Q: You guys came with a slightly different set-up on the car this weekend, kind of reverting back a little bit. It seems like it's trending the right direction. Does that give you hope into the summer break that you guys are getting back on pace?

GR: It's definitely better than the races we've had so far. So really pleased with that.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Oscar, if we could come to you first, very well done. That was a fighting second place. What's your overriding emotion after what is your 12th podium of the year?

OP: Mixed, I would say. You know, whenever you lose a race by such a little amount, it's obviously a bit painful, but I mean, I'm sure it was entertaining from the outside. It was entertaining from the inside as well. So, you know, pretty fun race, all things considered. But, obviously, when you're on the losing side of that battle, it's a little bit difficult. But, yeah, we tried our best, I think, and, you know, we got ahead of Charles. I don't know what happened to him in the last stint, but, yeah, some things to look back on, whether we should have done something a bit different in terms of strategy, but very easy to say in hindsight.

Q: Can I take you back to that battle with Lando in those last five laps? First of all, I mean, given the tyre offset, how confident were you?

OP: I was confident, but I knew it was going to be still incredibly tough because getting close to the car ahead is one thing, but trying to overtake is a completely different story. I knew that I was catching him a lot when I had clean air, but as soon as I got close, it was incredibly tough to stay close enough. There are so many corners in the middle sector that in some cases it almost feels like you do a better job in some corners, and then you pay the price at the next one because you're even closer. That made it very tough. And then with such long corners to end the lap, it just kills any downforce you've got. So, I knew that was going to be incredibly tough. Even if I had more laps, I'm not sure the result would have been any different, but I certainly tried.

Q: How much did the lock-up into Turn 1 prevent you having another go?

OP: Not that much, I don't think. I was able to close the gap again pretty quickly for the last lap. But it's kind of like I said, getting to within six or seven tenths was doable, but to then get even closer than that, I think I needed brand new Softs to be able to do much from that point. So, yeah, it was always going to be tough when I got close. But, I mean, you never want to not take an opportunity that you think is there in case another one never comes up. So, I had to go for it and, you know, in hindsight, obviously you can say maybe I should have waited another lap, but I'm pretty convinced that even if I had waited one more lap, it wouldn't have changed anything.

Q: Oscar, you said a moment ago some things you might have done differently. Do you wish you'd done a one-stop? Do you wish you hadn't tried to undercut Charles Leclerc? Can you just shed a bit of insight into that?

OP: I think we had to try and do something to beat Leclerc because it wasn't obvious that we just had enough pace to blow past him and go and win that way. So, we tried something. Was it the right thing in the end? I don't know. But it's always much easier when you're the car behind to take that risk. For Lando, there was virtually nothing to lose by trying a one-stop race. For myself, potentially there was. And, yeah, we'll look back and see if there was anything we should have done differently. But a two-stop was always the plan before the race, so it wasn't even really discussed that much about doing a one-stop. So, it was certainly a gamble.

Q: George, we'll come to you now. Well done to you as well. Very tenacious race. What does this one mean to you?

GR: Yeah, it's good to be back on the podium. It's obviously been a challenging run of form for us as a team these last six or so races, so it's a great way to enter the break.

Q: How do you explain the turnaround here at the Hungaroring?

GR: We reverted on some of the items we brought. Early in the season we brought a new rear suspension that clearly wasn't performing as we'd have hoped. But it was also a pretty unique weekend. You see the results by McLaren, and it was quite an unusual finishing order from P3 down. Obviously, Max was quite out of position. The Astons had a really strong race weekend as well. So, I don't think we should get carried away with the result. But, clearly, in terms of pace, it was our best race of the season bar Canada.

Q: Can I ask you about your overtake on Charles Leclerc? You seemed outspoken and unhappy with the way he was defending. What did he do wrong in your eyes, and did he deserve a five-second penalty?

GR: You know, when you're coming down the straight at 330 and you sort of dive into the corner, you're right on the limit of your car's grip. You can't just brake and turn to avoid somebody because you're already at the limit of that grip. So, I made my intentions really clear, diving to the inside, and he moved after he had committed to braking, which is not allowed in the rules because of that reason. So, he did it once. I wasn't happy about it. Second time, I was like, well, I'm going to just send it down the inside now, and he did it again, and we made contact. I was glad to get by. But I think when you watch it on TV, you think, “Oh, why can't you just turn to avoid it?” But as I said, you are right on the limit of the car's potential.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Edd Straw – The Race) Oscar, you said that the one-stop wasn't really on the radar, but was it kind of offered to you as a possibility to extend that first stint? And if not, should it have been? And if it was offered, would you have thought about it with more focus on the championship battle than perhaps the battle with Charles Leclerc?

OP: We did speak about it a bit before the race, so it wasn't completely off the table. But, in the race, I got asked about it. Very difficult to know from the cockpit what is going to be the best thing to do. Like I said, when you're the car behind, your risk-reward ratio is always much different. So, yeah, there's always that. Could we have matched Lando? That's, I guess, the question that I don't have the answer to. So, I guess that's the only thing. But we wanted to try and win the race as well, and the best way of trying to beat Lando is by trying to win the race as well. That was obviously an intention, but I think we'll definitely analyse if there was something we could have done a bit differently.

Q: (Patrik Fehér – Vezess.hu) Question to Oscar. After Canada, your championship lead was 22 points, and now it's only nine. What do you need after the summer break to turn around this trend, which is your point lead almost disappeared?

OP: I mean, the biggest lead of the year has been 23, and it's not moved within 10 points for the last ten races almost. So, I'm not really that fussed with that. Obviously, it would have been nice to have the extra points, but I don't think it's necessarily a trend. One second different, and the trend would have looked quite different today. Things happening in the last few races differently could have meant quite a different picture. But you can say that about pretty much every race this year and about every championship ever. So, I'm not concerned at all. I think the pace for the first half of the year has been very, very strong, and I think the last few races as well have been very good. I feel like I've driven a lot of strong races, and it's been very tightly fought. So, I expect more of the same after the break.

[Lando Norris joins the conference]

Q: Lando, well done to you. Great race. Now look, you've won some great Grands Prix in the past. In terms of execution, are any of them more satisfying than this one?

LN: I think it's one of the first ones I've won in probably this manner. I've not won many races, so most circumstances are still new, but I think it's the first one where doing a completely alternate strategy to most, giving myself that opportunity, worked out. I think there have been some others where going long in the first stint, Miami, then getting the Safety Car, things like that have helped me from a luck side. Today, there was not really any of that. So, I think the most rewarding from “let's try to do something different” and it working out, which was a good one. It's a tough strategy to do, but it worked out. That's the most important thing. And, honestly, I didn't really think it was going to work for the majority of that second stint. But with every lap, I kind of gained more confidence that it was going to be closer and closer. So, yeah, definitely a rewarding one.

Q: Just how tough was it to make that set of tyres last 39 laps?

LN: I mean, it's more just making them last at the pace that we were at. I made the Mediums last until, like, what, lap 32 or something. So it wasn't a terrible thought that I can make the Hards last until the end. It was more I just knew I'd have to push flat out for basically every single lap, and that's when it gets a little bit tricky. The tyres get hot. It's easy to make mistakes. The last few laps, the rubber is probably pretty low, and it's just so easy to lock a tyre into one, into two, the chicane, things like that. So, yeah, I knew I could make the tyres get to the end quite easily, but it was more to stay ahead of the other people. It was trying to get ahead of mainly George and Charles at that point. I didn't have a lot of hope that I'd still be in a fight with Oscar till the very end but turned out to be. So that was even better.

Q: Can we wind it back to the beginning now? What were you thinking at the end of the opening lap when you were down in P5?

LN: ‘Brilliant'. Yeah. That's actually what I said over the line the first lap. Because I did, I watched quite a few videos of lap one to Turn 1. Clearly, it didn't work.

Q: So, Lando, what actually happened at the start? You seemed to make a very good getaway, but just…

LN: My start was good. I think Charles' was pretty good as well. Oscar then came over to the left, and I was kind of just hoping both were going to be on the right. I got a bit of a slipstream on Oscar. I had to pull out to the right, but Oscar could stay in the slipstream of Charles, which then gave him a bit more speed again. But at that point, it was hard to back out and go to the left because I would have had to brake a bit. I mean, I'll look back and review it and see what I could have done better. I feel like I was more just unlucky with how things panned out. I think if we were to do it again, most of the time things would turn out better than they did today. So, I think it was just worst-case scenario. But my start was good, and I have nothing to really complain about.

Q: (Eva Vandor – HVG) A question to Lando and Oscar. How do you feel about the second half of the season, and how tough do you expect it to be mentally to get to the end and hopefully a world championship?

LN: I think it's already tough, and it's going to continue to be tough. It's pretty small margins between us. I'm sure there's some things I can do better on and improve on, and I'm sure he'll probably say a similar thing. So, it's going to be a good and tough battle probably till the end. It takes a lot out of you trying to focus so much for every single session, race, everything. So, it's going be a long second half of the season, I'm sure, but at the same time, I'm looking forward to a nice break, a bit of time to rest. And, yeah, try and come back even better because there are those things I need to improve on and want to improve on. I'm not giving myself the best opportunities. Even though the results have looked great, I'm not making my life very easy for myself at the minute. So if I can work on those things, then I'll be in a better place.

OP: Yeah, very much the same. I think it's going to be a tough second half of the year. It has been tough already, and the margins are very fine. So, I think it's going to be great watching.

Q: (Zsolt Godina – F1Vilag.hu) Oscar, last year you said that you would like to improve your qualifying performance for this year. Are you satisfied with the progress you have made? And which areas should you improve more in order to beat Lando in the championship this year?

OP: I've been happy with qualifying this year. Still not been perfect, but it's certainly been a good improvement from last year. I don't really feel like there's one area that's lacking. I felt the same last year; it's just that I never got it all together on the same weekend very often. This year, I felt much more like that, and it's just going to be about trying to do that every weekend to the end of the year. So that's going to be the key.

Q: (Lawrence Edmondson – ESPN) Question for Lando. Andrea just said that going into the race, McLaren weren't sure if a one-stop would even get to the end of the race. So, at what point in that race did you actually start to think, hang on, this is on if I manage it in the right way?

LN: When Will asked me, “What do you think of the one-stop?” I think at that point, I was already, like, seven seconds behind Oscar and eight or nine behind Charles. So, not that I thought my race was over, but it was pretty slim that I was going to be able to at least fight from there, even on a perfect two-stop strategy. So, my expectations were not high, but I was more banking on a safety car or a VSC or something to bring me back into the race. But I didn't have any of that. In the end, I guess it didn't matter. I can't remember if it was just before George boxed or just after that. Will said, “What do we think of a one-stop?” and I said, “Let's do it.” My confidence wasn't the highest, but it was my best chance of trying to do something. And it turned out to be a little bit trickier because it actually allowed me to fight until the very end for the win. Not sure it still felt like the best strategy, but I think with how difficult overtaking was, it turned out to be pretty good.

Q: (Simen Naes Hagen - VGI Parc Fermé) Charles Leclerc said before this weekend that you McLaren guys are going to be the only ones having fun the rest of the season. But do you expect one of the other teams to catch up after the break, or will we see you dominate like Red Bull did in '23 and '22?

LN: I hope we dominate.

OP: I mean, I hope the same thing, but I think we will have competition at certain points through the year. I don't know what happened to Charles in the second half of the race, but clearly something happened because he looked quite quick for the first half. So, I think there are some tracks that other teams have historically been quite quick at, and we'll wait and see if that's the same this year.

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur has come to the defence of Lewis Hamilton after the Briton described himself as ""useless"" during the Hungarian Grand Prix weekend.

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur has come to the defence of Lewis Hamilton, suggesting the seven-time World Champion is ""frustrated but not demotivated"" after comments made during the Hungarian Grand Prix weekend.

Hamilton has endured a difficult spell with Ferrari since joining the team at the start of the season, and that run continued in Budapest as the Briton failed to advance beyond Q2 in Qualifying.

This was in comparison to team mate Charles Leclerc, who took pole position, and in the media pen after Saturday's session Hamilton claimed “I'm useless, absolutely useless"", while suggesting that Ferrari ""probably need to change driver"".

Hamilton eventually finished Sunday's race in P12, his first time finishing outside the points at the Hungaroring, where he has won eight times previously, with Vasseur sympathetic towards his driver.

""I don't need to motivate him, honestly,"" said Vasseur following the Grand Prix. ""He's frustrated but not demotivated, it's a completely different story.

""Again, I can perfectly understand the situation and you can, sometimes you are making comments on what the driver is saying to the car, but if you put the microphone on some other sportsman in football and so on, I'm not sure that it would be much better.

""Sometimes they are making [rash] comments, even when they jump out of the car.

""I can understand the frustration, but we are all frustrated and sometimes if you ask me, I can't say this, I will go to the stewards.

""But sometimes just after the race, or just after the Quali, you are very disappointed and the reaction, the first reaction is harsh, but we all know that we are pushing in the same direction.""

Vasseur, who penned a new multi-year contract to stay at Ferrari in previous days, admitted that while Hamilton was being hard on himself and the team, these were the qualities which had yielded so much success for him in the past.

""Yes, he's demanding, but I think it's also why he is seven-time World Champion, that he is demanding with the team, with the car, with the engineers, with the mechanics, with myself also, but first of all he is very demanding with himself,"" he said.

Vasseur was not the only high-profile paddock figure to come to the defence of Hamilton during the weekend, as Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicalli also voiced his opinion in support of the Ferrari driver.

“First of all, Lewis is a jewel, he is an incredible athlete, so no matter if it is a difficult moment, he will react, and I'm pretty sure he will show the reason why he is here,” noted Domenicali to Sky Sports F1.

“He wants to achieve his eighth title, and he will triumph again. So, stay with Lewis and he will do a great race, and be very, very strong after the summer [break].”

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

The full official starting order for Sunday's 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix in Budapest.

For the first time in 2025 we have a Ferrari starting a Grand Prix from pole position. The question now is can Charles Leclerc stay ahead of the all-conquering McLarens when the lights go out at the Hungaroring.

Leclerc will have championship leader Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris breathing down his neck in the run to Turn 1, and don't discount P4 qualifier George Russell getting in on the action for Mercedes on the opening lap.

Come to that, probably best to keep an eye on the Aston Martins too. The team in green have been the biggest shock of the Budapest weekend so far, with Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll a superb fifth and sixth respectively on the grid.

There was another superlative qualifying performance from rookie Gabriel Bortoleto, who put his Kick Sauber a stunning seventh, immediately ahead of the Red Bull of reigning World Champion Max Verstappen. Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar complete the top 10 starters.

Starting from the pit lane will be Yuki Tsunoda. The Japanese driver had qualified 16th, but Red Bull have since opted to change the power unit and set-up on his car.

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Former title rivals Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton shared a dramatic, wheel-to-wheel moment during the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton came close to colliding during the Hungarian Grand Prix as the World Champions battled to better their disappointing grid positions.

On Lap 29 of Sunday's race, Verstappen got a run on Hamilton at the exit of Turn 3 and attempted a bold move down the inside of the high-speed Turn 4, where the Ferrari driver left the track and took to the run-off area.

Verstappen moved up to 11th in the process and, while the stewards noted and then investigated the incident post-race, they ultimately opted against penalising the Red Bull man, who went on to finish ninth.

“The driver of Car 1 (Verstappen) stated during the hearing that he had gained some momentum on Car 44 (Hamilton) out of Turn 3 with fresher tyres and used this momentum to make a move on the inside into Turn 4,” began the stewards' decision document.

“He further elaborated that he was in full control of his car and could have stayed further to the inside to leave space for Car 44 on the exit.

“However, he said as Car 44 had gone off track, he elected to use all of the track on the exit.

“The team representative of Car 44 confirmed that there was no contact between both cars and further stated that the driver of Car 44 chose not to attempt to remain on track.

“Taking all this into account, the stewards determine that there was no contact and that the incident does not qualify as forcing another car off track despite the ambitious nature of the overtaking attempt and take no further action.”

Watch the moment Verstappen and Hamilton – the latter crossing the line 12th – went wheel-to-wheel in the video player at the top of the page.

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Lando Norris got the better of Oscar Piastri in the latest scrap between the McLaren drivers at the Hungaroring.

Lando Norris was all smiles following the Hungarian Grand Prix, having resisted a blistering charge from McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri to take the chequered flag first.

Norris endured a difficult start to Sunday's race in Budapest when he dropped from third to fifth, behind Aston Martin rival Fernando Alonso and the Mercedes of George Russell.

After making his way past Alonso's car, Norris decided to stretch out his first stint and opt for a one-stop strategy, while Russell, Piastri and pole-sitting Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc went down the two-stop route.

Norris assumed the lead of the race once the final pit stops had been completed and, despite Piastri closing a gap of more than 10 seconds to pile the pressure on in the closing laps, the Briton ultimately had enough in hand to secure the win.

“I'm dead, I'm dead,” Norris smiled when giving his initial reaction to the fight and race as a whole before the podium ceremony.

“We weren't really planning on the one-stop at the beginning, but after the first lap it was kind of our only option to get back into things. It was tough.

“The final stint with Oscar catching, I was pushing flat-out. My voice has gone a little bit! But good, rewarding even more because of that – the perfect result today.”

Asked to expand on why he went for one stop rather than two, Norris continued: “I didn't think it would probably get us the win; I thought maybe it would get us at least into second.

“I knew our pace was good. Even in the first stint behind George, I couldn't get past but the pace was strong, so I knew if I just had some clean air and I could push, I could maybe make things work. That's what we did.

“It's always a bit of a gamble, these kind of things, but it also requires no mistakes, good laps, good strategy, all these things. That's what we had today, so I'm very happy.”

Norris' ninth career win means he cuts Piastri's championship lead from 16 points to nine as teams head into the summer break – setting up a thrilling second half of 2025.

As for whether he feels momentum is on his side in the intra-team battle, Norris said: “I think we're so tightly fought it's hard to say if momentum is on anyone's side.

“We're fighting hard, I think both of us… It's tough, but fun racing against Oscar.

“It's great for us as a team, another 1-2, our 200th win actually in F1. Credit to Oscar, he put up a good charge and I just about held on. I look forward to plenty more of these.”

Radio Rewind: 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

The drivers and teams report back on all the action from the Hungaroring for the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Piastri got a decent start and was running second behind Leclerc in the first stint. But Norris braked too early for Turn 1 and fell behind Russell and Alonso. While Piastri then tried to undercut Leclerc in the first stops, Norris was left out after he could not find a way back past the Mercedes. That translated into a one-stop strategy for Norris, the only thing he could do having lost so much time in the first few laps behind Alonso. Piastri was shadowing Leclerc on a two-stop strategy, and picked off the Ferrari man after the second stops, but Norris had track position thanks to his strategy. Despite closing the nine-second gap to his team mate and having fresher tyres, Piastri ran out of time to mount a serious challenge for the win and, one desperate lock-up later, had to trail Norris home as the Briton won for the third time in the last four races.

Lando Norris, 1st

""The perfect result today. Another 1-2 and I'm really pleased to win the 200th Grand Prix for McLaren. It means a lot to me, and it's even more rewarding because it was a tough race. We weren't planning on the one-stop at the beginning, but after the first lap it was the only option to challenge the cars around us. I knew our pace was good, even in the first stint behind George, so I knew I could push in clean air. It's always a gamble, but it also requires no mistakes, good laps, good strategy and good pit stops, and that's what we had today. Credit to Oscar who put up a good charge. I look forward to plenty more of these after the summer break.""

Oscar Piastri, 2nd

""It's always frustrating to miss out on the win by such a small margin, but overall, another great result for the team. It's easy in hindsight to say the one-stopper would have been quicker, but there was only a second in it, so it's something we will review as a team. It was an entertaining and fun race all things considered, and the team executed well, especially on the pit stops. Now for a well-earned break, thanks to the team for all of their work so far this season.""

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“A superb 1-2 finish in Hungary delivered the 200th win for the McLaren Formula 1 Team this weekend, which myself as Team Principal, Zak as CEO and the entire team are proud and privileged to have delivered following in the footsteps of our founder Bruce McLaren.

“While the two-stop strategy was slightly faster in today's race, Lando was able to deviate to a one-stop due to his track position. This allowed him to do something different to the other drivers and manage the Medium tyre in the first stint and then the Hard tyre very well until the end of the race.

“Oscar can be proud of his race weekend, he was very fast and it was close at the end in the challenge for first. Both Lando and Oscar pushed hard to make the most of their opportunities and it could have finished one way or the other.

“Overall, today's race was firm but very fair with both drivers demonstrating the values of what it means to be a McLaren team member. We head into the summer break celebrating four consecutive 1-2 finishes which is a great achievement. Thank you to the entire team both at track and back in Woking, you all played your part in victory 200!”

Mercedes had a good race, their car looking much better as conditions started to cool. Russell was opportunistic at the start, picking off a sluggish Norris to run third. Like Leclerc and Piastri, he two-stopped and found himself out of the podium places as a result. But he chased down and picked off Leclerc with a late-braking move into Turn 1, the duo coming close to contact. That bagged Russell his first podium since Canada, and Antonelli made it two cars in the points for the Silver Arrows. He battled from P15 on the grid to 10th despite the Hungaroring being notoriously difficult to overtake at, making his hard tyres last a staggering 48 laps.

George Russell, 3rd

""It's great to be back on the podium. We've taken a step forward with the car this weekend, so it is a deserved reward for the hard work of everyone at Brackley and Brixworth. It looked like we were on for a lonely P4, but we closed on Leclerc in the closing stages. The overtake itself was a little dicey; I committed to the corner, and he clearly moved under braking, for which he was given a penalty. Thankfully there was no harm done and we were able to take P3.

""This result gives us encouragement heading into the summer break and we can look forward to the final 10 races of the year now with more confidence. We can't get carried away as we didn't expect to be in the top three this weekend. We know the competitive order behind McLaren is tight and we will need to be at our best to fight for podiums consistently in the second half of the season.""

Kimi Antonelli, 10th

""That final stint was a very long one. It felt never-ending! I did close to 50 laps on that Hard tyre and by the end, I was just hanging on out of the final corner each lap and defending into turn one. The cars behind had superior grip but I was able to keep them behind. It felt great to get that final point as our pace in free air was good. If I can start nearer the front after the summer break, then I know we can fight for good points each weekend.

""I am really happy that my confidence in the car has come back this weekend. I leave Budapest feeling much more comfortable after moving back to the previous rear suspension. Yesterday's qualifying was just a shame as the pace was clearly there. We can take this feeling into the second half of the season and look forward to it with optimism now.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""This has been a positive weekend for the team here in Hungary. We reverted on the rear suspension specification and that helped provide a much more stable and balanced car for the drivers. They had more confidence in it and that was reflected in their pace. It was solid throughout and that helped George score a well-deserved podium and put Kimi in a position to hold off several cars for a point, despite being on nearly 50 lap old tyres.

""This result and our overall performance here at the Hungaroring give us a direction for the rest of the season. As our focus turns to 2026, we won't have any more major aerodynamic upgrades to bring to the track. Nevertheless, there are refinements we can make as we look to optimise the car we have. That will be useful as we look to end 2025 in a positive way and fight for second in the Constructors' Championship over these final 10 races of the year.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""We leave the Hungaroring pleased with a solid result and encouraged by the improvement we have seen with the W16. George, starting P4, fought hard with Norris throughout the first two stints, showing good pace throughout. The McLaren was ultimately able to make the one stop work and with it, take victory. George's speed though helped us close down the Ferrari of Leclerc and pick him off for P3 and the podium in the closing stages.

""With Kimi, the first half of the race was frustrating as he was stuck in a train of cars all on different compounds. We opted to stop him to claim some free air, but he soon found himself back in the pack. It is to his great credit that by extending on the Hard tyre he opened the possibility of claiming the final point in P10. Some clever driving on near 50 lap old tyres held off Hadjar and Hamilton in what was an impressive final stint.

""We now head into the mandatory summer shutdown period. When we return after the break, we will be looking to optimise the W16 and build on this confidence building weekend when we return in Zandvoort. There are still 10 races to go, and we want to end the season on a high. We are also in a battle for second in the Constructors' Championship and we will be doing everything we can to claim this by the season finale in Abu Dhabi.""

Leclerc got away well from pole, and led throughout the first stint as the Ferrari looked to have very decent race pace. But after the second pit stops, the Monegasque driver started to complain about the car – even saying the issue would cost him a podium. He proved to be right, as first Piastri swept past and then Russell did so. Leclerc fought the Mercedes man a bit harder and was handed a five-second penalty for moving under braking, but that did not affect his finishing position. Hamilton opted for the hard tyres at the start and ran a long first stint. He was stuck in traffic so could not make much progress, and despite one-stopping, came home outside the points. He was also sent wide at one point as Verstappen tried to get past as their old rivalry resumed, but would not be drawn afterwards on the incident.

Charles Leclerc, 4th

""This is not the outcome we hoped for but there was nothing we could have done to control it considering the issue we had. I got some more insight into what was happening after getting out of the car and it turns out that we had an issue on the chassis that started just about when I began to feel a difference in how the car behaved. It's frustrating, because I think we could have won today, but we will return after the summer break and give it our all to come back stronger.""

Lewis Hamilton, 12th

""It's been a challenging weekend and one to move on from. We weren't able to make the progress we hoped for but I'm grateful for the effort everyone in the team put in throughout the weekend. Now we head into the break. I'll be using the time to reset, recharge and come back stronger. I'm not where I want to be yet, but the fight's not over - don't count me out.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""The weekend went pretty well at first, in the practice sessions and in quali. In the race, the first two stints of Charles were under control, the first especially was very good, Charles pulling out a gap over the McLarens and Russell. He came under a bit more pressure in the second stint and then in the final one, we were losing two seconds a lap. Now we need to understand what happened on the chassis that made the car so hard for Charles to drive. At least we got the points for fourth place because there was even some doubt that Charles could finish the race.

""I can understand perfectly his frustration as we were covering Piastri and he had the performance in his pocket to do it.

""As for Lewis, starting on Hards, he lost a couple of places and that put him in traffic in a very long DRS train, which is the worst possible scenario. That's what decided us to go for a one-stop with him.  Looking at the positives, of course yesterday we got our first pole position of the season and for the first part of the race we were matching McLaren in terms of pace and we had a 15 second lead over Russell. But then we lost everything and didn't have the pace anymore so now we have to investigate why.""

Alonso had a great start and picked off Norris. While he didn't fight the McLaren man too hard when Norris flew back past after a few laps, the Spaniard always looked on for a very solid fifth. With only one set of mediums and one set of hards, Aston Martin looked to be leaning towards a one-stop race and that is exactly what they did. Alonso came home where he started, while Stroll finished one place back from where he started after losing out to Bortoleto off the line.

__Fernando Alonso, 5th __

""Today's race went to plan for us and we maximised the performance of the car this weekend. It was a good job by everyone in the team and we are happy to have scored 16 points. We had some threats to deal with in the race, but we managed to keep them behind. The performance we've shown here has been a nice surprise, but we need to analyse everything from Spa and Budapest so we can better understand why we were much faster here in Hungary. I will enjoy the short break now and I look forward to racing again in Zandvoort.""

Lance Stroll, 7th

""It was a great day for the team and a solid weekend from start to finish. Heading into the summer break with 16 points is a big uplift for us. But we have lots to learn from this weekend because we don't fully understand why we were more competitive here. We need to be in a place where we can put the car in that window at more tracks because ultimately, we want to be at this level of competitiveness more consistently. We'll see how we go in Zandvoort after the break because it's a very different kind of track.""

Mike Krack, Chief Trackside Officer

""Fifth and seventh place in Budapest is a good way to wrap up the first half of the year. Fernando and Lance have been excellent all weekend and converted our strong qualifying result into important points. They both made the one-stop strategy work and did a great job of managing the Medium tyres during the long first stint. It has been our most competitive weekend this season so well done to the entire team for the great preparation and execution. It is always nice to start the summer break off the back of a good result and these 16 points will give everybody in the team a boost. We will take a few weeks' holiday and come back ready to build on this result in the races to come.""

Both Kick Sauber drivers had their starts looked at, with Bortoleto nipping ahead of Stroll and Hulkenberg making up a place as well. In the end only the German was penalised, to the tune of five seconds. He was the first to pit too, and that did undercut him past several cars, but the advantage was lost when he pitted a second time. As for Bortoleto, he grabbed his best finish of the season after some heroic defence to keep Verstappen at bay in the early stages. That enabled the rookie to one-stop, and he came home comfortably between the two Aston Martins – who are now Kick Sauber's closest rival in the championship.

Hadjar did not get away too cleanly and dropped out of the points. To make matters worse, gravel kicked up on the first lap caught his hand in a painful-looking moment. But Lawson made a better start and, while he couldn't keep Verstappen at bay in the early stages, he remained in the points. From there the team opted to one-stop both cars which proved the right call, Lawson finishing ahead of a two-stopping Verstappen in the end, while Hadjar's quest for P10 was hampered by blue flags for the leaders with just a few laps to go.

Isack Hadjar, 11th

“It's pure frustration just missing out on points. The pace was strong all weekend, and I felt confident going into the race. Unfortunately, we didn't get a great launch at the start. I gave it everything on lap one, but got overtaken and ended up getting stuck behind other cars. On the Medium tyres, our pace was solid. It's a good result for the team and for Liam, there are definitely plenty of positives to take away. The car has the potential, I just need to put everything together when it counts. We've been a bit unlucky in the last few races, but I'm optimistic about the second half of the season. I'll stay focused on what's ahead and come back stronger after the summer break.”

Liam Lawson, 8th

""I'm very happy with today's result. It was a tough race and trying to find a window for boxing was tricky with all the traffic. The speed was really good as well as the degradation on the tyres, so everything was well executed by the team. It's never easy keeping a driver like Max behind you, but our strategy meant that we could keep position until the end. It's obviously great to have more consistency over the most recent races, but the key thing is for us to keep the momentum going following the much-deserved summer break.""

Alan Permane, Team Principal

“A very strong race from Liam, both the car and the one-stop strategy worked very well; he made the tyres last well and brings home another 8th place. It was a shame for Isack, he felt he could have qualified better yesterday and ultimately on this track, two or three places in Qualifying is ever so hard to get back in the race. We lost a place to Bearman at the start, losing a lot of time behind him, which then undid the rest of his race. Overall though, the car has been decent with both of them in Q3 in the last two races. Unfortunately, we've lost a position in the Championship, but it's all very tight in the midfield and we have a good car, so we're looking forward to the second half of the season and I'm very sure we'll get some positions back. A massive thank you to the drivers and all our teams back in Faenza and Milton Keynes, we can have a breather as we go into the break, and  we'll come back very strong in Zandvoort.""

Tsunoda opted for a pit lane start today, and at a track where overtaking is difficult, spent most of his afternoon caught in DRS trains. He had one close call with Hulkenberg when fighting for position before trailing home down the order. Verstappen had a more eventful day in many ways. He lost a place off the line but soon recovered, only to get stuck behind an obdurate Bortoleto. The team pitted him early for the undercut, and he debated switching to a one-stop after rising to fifth. But that early first stop made that impossible, and a late second stop dropped him down the order. He was also called to the stewards after an overtake on Hamilton midway through the race that sent the Ferrari man wide, but no further action was taken.

Max Verstappen, 9th

""Unfortunately, the whole weekend wasn't good for us and we need to understand why that was. It has been quite tough as we got stuck in between cars during the race and struggled for grip. Although the high speed was okay, the low and medium speed wasn't good. There are a lot of things to understand as the car has been difficult all weekend and we couldn't turn things around unfortunately. Like we always do, we will analyse everything and take learnings from the weekend to find more performance as we go into Zandvoort. Ultimately, this weekend hasn't gone to our liking, but it is now summer break and I can enjoy time with family and friends and not think too much about the racing side of things. There are many more races left and we can look to do better after the break. We want to aim to be more consistent and always try and even though it was a disappointing result we will keep our head up.""

Yuki Tsunoda, 17th

""This weekend has been a tough one for the Team. We knew coming into today that it would be tricky to move up into the points, and once I had damage to the front wing our race was effectively over. The gurney flap fell off halfway through and that cost us a lot of pace and worsening grip, so we then lost the ability to make a positive strategy call that would benefit us. Looking back on the season so far I can feel pretty positive, we've made progress, especially since the new floor upgrades were brought to Spa. The gap with Max continues to close, it may not feel like we are getting there but on paper we are only 1/10th off his pace, I'm not sure many other drivers could get as close to him. I am heading straight to the factory tomorrow to go into the Sim, we need to investigate where we went wrong and put in some hard work over the summer break so that we don't start the next half of the season how we finished this one. It's frustrating but we will stay positive and bounce back stronger.""

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

""It has been a very tough weekend from the first lap in FP1 and the race reflected this. We have certainly missed something quite key this weekend and looked at many things with both Yuki and Max, to try to get back to the level we had and get the car in the right window. The Team have tried everything, but the underlying performance was missing to be able to fight at the top end. The truth is we didn't have the performance so when we pitted Max wasn't ultimately going to be defining to the race result, we just did not have the lap time we needed in the car. Yuki was in a similar situation and starting from the pitlane meant he was never able to really make an impact on the field. What is important this weekend is that we have collected enough data to get out of similar situations in the future and make a positive step forward. These weekends are the ones you learn a lot from and that is what we will do. We will spend time reflecting during the break and we don't underestimate the work ahead of us, we have many, many talented people in the Team to overcome this and we want to come back with a different level of performance after the summer break.""

Not to be for Willaims in Hungary, a venue where they seemed to lack pace all weekend long. Albon made up three places at the start after opting for the soft tyres, with Sainz also starting on the red-marked tyre. But both found themselves stuck in DRS trains, and the timing of their pit stops could not create any better opportunities. Sainz's day was made worse when he tangled with Gasly, who was penalised for the incident. But on a day where many of their rivals scored big, Williams know they have work to do to get back to the points.

Alex Albon, 15th

""It was a very tough weekend. I came into this weekend optimistic, and I feel like we're a little bit exposed around this track and the car didn't really suit it. We struggled in the race more than I thought we would. We need to do our homework because I know we would do a better job if we had another go at it. It's going to be a dogfight for the rest of the year and it's not going to be easy. I think we favour the lower downforce circuits and others probably favour the higher downforce ones, so we'll see how it plays out. But I'm going to fight like hell to keep P5 in the Championship for us and I'm sure Carlos feels the same. It's going to be a fight to the end.""

Carlos Sainz, 14th

""It was a cleaner weekend for us; it's just a shame it's not on a weekend where the car is strong. P13 looked like the maximum, which is where we would've been without the incident with Gasly. We tried to do a one-stop but that was probably too optimistic going from the Soft to the Hard, but we tried to do something different before switching to the two-stop. I'm leaving the first half of the season slightly disappointed as we didn't maximise the weekends where we were stronger, but hopefully the second half of the season is the other way around. A big thanks to the team for their massive effort and to all our fans for their endless support. We'll reset, recharge and come back stronger for the rest of the season!""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""A difficult weekend. We need to make sure that we learn and understand why we can be strong on one circuit and poor in others. It's a pattern that's been consistent over years, but we need to break out of it in order for us to be able to move up the grid. I'm really proud of what the team has achieved in the first half of the season. It's great to be in fifth in the Championship. However, we have to recognise it will be a close fought battle to the end of the year and we have to maximise every opportunity that comes towards us. Well done to everyone on the team, Alex and Carlos for everything we've achieved in the first half of the year. It's time for everyone to enjoy a break and come back refreshed in a few weeks.""

Haas were one of three teams not to score in Hungary. Bearman started solidly in the midfield, but he ran into trouble after picking up some floor damage and wound up being the only retiree from the race. Ocon tried a very ambitious one-stop race, making his hard tyres last 55 laps. But he was picked off late on by those on fresher rubber, and dropped back through the order to finish P16.

Esteban Ocon, 16th

“It was a difficult day for sure. We struggled a little bit, especially towards the end, as I think the cars behind were a bit quicker on fresher tyres. We got ahead of them, so we gave ourselves the opportunity. It was a solid start, but we need to work on how we can get the car a little bit more under control and get more pace throughout the race. Looking at this first half of the season, there are definitely some positives – a decent amount of points – but we're not consistent enough. If you look at Spa, we had a mega performance in the Sprint, and obviously we're not there every single weekend, but we're working on it and I have full trust in this team.”

Oliver Bearman, DNF

“We managed to run in P10 for the first stint, but I was really clinging on the whole way. I was really struggling with the feeling of the car, and I had massive oversteer throughout. It progressed in the second stint, picking up some damage somewhere because we saw a big drop in loads, and by that point, it was clear that we couldn't finish the race. It's disappointing as we had a decent qualifying and opening lap today, but from there I wasn't looking forward, I was looking behind. We need to understand why that was the case because in the last few races I've been feeling really good in race trim, but this weekend it hasn't been the case.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“We didn't show what we should be showing today. With how quick the car is, where we should've qualified, and the race pace of Bortoleto, there's no reason we can't do that. I'm pretty sure Ollie's car was overbalanced, there's no way that degradation from Ollie was the limit of the car or driver. We retired Ollie as he damaged the floor at Turn 4 again, it's the third time this weekend, so we need to look at that also. On Esteban's side, we need to look at our processes as clearly we were too early with our pit stop for a one-stop strategy. The only way is up, the car is quick, and we have two drivers with potential – we've just struggled putting it together for the last three races. We need the summer break, refocus, look at ourselves and then think about how we can deliver.”

Alpine had a day to forget in Hungary, with their drivers propping up the field. Nothing quite worked for them, with Colapinto pitting early in a bid to undercut some rivals. That forced him onto a two-stop strategy, and his second stop sent him backwards. Gasly was on a one-stop, but he was handed a 10-second time penalty for an incident with Sainz and that compromised his afternoon. Alpine remain rooted to the bottom of the table, with the only silver lining the fact that Haas also failed to score.

Pierre Gasly, 19th

“We cannot be pleased with the end result today, even if it felt like our execution was quite good. Ultimately, we are just too slow. The last two weekends we have been able to maximise the conditions and come away with two good results. Today was more conventional and it really highlighted our weak spots. Still, there were a lot of fun battles out there and I felt like the racing was generally very good. I am here to race, not to give up, and I just gave it my best in all the wheel-to-wheel fights. Now, the team and I are staying in Budapest for a test before the summer break. We have all been working extremely hard and I am sure everyone is looking forward to a couple of weeks off. We will continue the hard work, especially with a lot of focus on 2026, but we are still aiming to come back in good shape for the remainder of this year.”

Franco Colapinto, 18th

“It was not the best of days today and a difficult race for us as a team. The pace was good at times in clean air and I had the same feeling as yesterday, I think we have taken a good step forward with the car which has given me confidence. But with the blue flags and losing time in the pitlane, it really limited what we could achieve today. The initial start and getaway was good, but from there we fell back on the first lap and lost places. I was struggling with rear grip and sliding, which came back to us later in the race. We opted for a two-stop and unfortunately, we encountered issues on both which meant we were held longer than we expected. As a team, we've been very good recently with pitstops, but these things happen in racing. With the summer break we need to use this opportunity to rest and reset and be ready to go again in Zandvoort and try to understand where we can keep making improvements.”

Flavio Briatore, Executive Advisor

“A disappointing end result and a difficult weekend overall for the team, which has really highlighted areas of weakness in our car. It has been a tough season so far and the aim for the remainder of the year is to try and turnaround our current position. It is a big challenge as all our focus is on 2026 and capitalising on the opportunity of the new regulations. Now is a critical phase in our work for next year and I know the team at Enstone is making positive headway on that project. I expect everyone to come back from the summer break with a lot of determination and fighting spirit, giving it our all to finish the season as strongly as possible and make sure we're ready for 2026.”

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“The first part of the season came to an end with a very interesting race, with three drivers fighting for the win. In the end, victory went to Norris, beating team-mate Piastri by a whisker. The two McLaren drivers were on different strategies, the Englishman going for a one-stop, the Australian two. On paper the two-stop was quicker, but the cooler, by about ten degrees, temperatures compared to Friday free practice, slightly closed the gap between the two options, also in part because thermal degradation was reduced for all three compounds compared to what we saw two days ago. Honestly, we still felt the two-stop was best, you just need to look at the gap that Alonso built up, in fifth, compared to Russell. The exception was Norris, who opted to only stop once, after finding himself fifth after the opening lap. The small performance difference between the Medium and Hard along with the clear difficulty in overtaking with cars running pretty similar race pace, made it worth risking an unconventional strategy because at that point, he had nothing to lose.

“All things considered, today we still managed to have a race in which different strategies were in play for the win, which made the second half of the race particularly exciting from a tactical point of view, even if not that spectacular in absolute terms.

“Before we too go on the summer break following a very busy first part of the season, we still have one more task on track, here at the Hungaroring. On Tuesday 5 and Wednesday 6 August, we will run a test session aimed at 2026 tyre development. On the menu, validating constructions, as these must be homologated by 1st September and development of the softest compounds, especially from C3 to C5. Supporting us in this on the first day will be McLaren with Norris at the wheel and Racing Bulls with Lawson driving. On the second day Ferrari will run Leclerc, while Alpine is doing both days, the first with Aron at the wheel, the second with both Colapinto and Gasly.”

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Aston Martin secured its best result of the season as both Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll finished in the points in Hungary.

Fernando Alonso believes there was ""nothing more we could ask"" from the Hungarian Grand Prix as Aston Martin secured its best team result of the season.

The 44-year-old Spaniard initially started the weekend in Budapest on the back foot, having been forced to miss Free Practice 1 due to a small back injury where he was replaced by reserve driver, Felipe Drugovich.

Alonso returned to the cockpit for the rest of the weekend, which proved a good decision, as he qualified fifth for Sunday's 70-lap race and was joined on the third row by team mate Lance Stroll, the pair less than two tenths away from pole position.

It signified a remarkable turnaround for the British team, which only a week earlier had qualified on the back row of the grid in Belgium before registering a double non-score.

""Definitely very happy, P5 the best result of the year and the best result as a team, 16 points before the summer break it feels good,"" said Alonso, who has now scored points in five of the last six races.

""It was one of those weekends that everything feels right since Free Practice. A good Quali yesterday, good race, good execution, good tyre management. Nothing more we could ask.""

The result, which was achieved via a one-stop strategy for both Alonso and Stroll, has launched Aston Martin up from P8 to P6 in the Teams' Championship ahead of Kick Sauber and Racing Bulls.

The team only sits 18 points behind Williams and, with 10 races remaining as well as an upturn in form, Alonso is hopeful of a strong end to the season.

""Definitely more optimistic for the second part of the year. We really needed this result,"" said Alonso.

""Spa last week we were at the bottom of the list and now we are P5 and P7 so we need to learn what is the difference between the two tracks, what we did different to the car and try to apply those learnings into the next race.""

The first-look images come a few days after Sony unveiled Holland's new Spidey suit and Mark Ruffalo was announced as part of the film's cast.

	McKinley Franklin



Spider-Man: Brand New Day is officially on its way. 


Tom Holland celebrated production on his fourth Spider-Man film kicking off with a few behind-the-scenes photos. On Instagram, the English actor shared two pictures of himself on set, notably in his brand-new Spidey suit. 




	In the shots, Holland stood on top of a military-like automobile with a stunt wire attached to his body. “Spider-Man Brand New Day 1,” he wrote in the caption of the post. 

A post shared by Tom Holland (@tomholland2013)


	Production on Spider-Man: Brand New Day was set to kick off at the top of August. Holland's social post gave fans a first look at his new Spider-Man costume after Sony unveiled the suit Saturday morning.

	“We ready?” Holland said in the teaser clip while wearing the costume that notably sports a more classic Spider-Man look, resembling the outfits that both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield wore in their respective films as the character. 


	On Friday, it was announced that Mark Ruffalo will appear in Brand New Day, notably reprising his role as Bruce Banner/the Hulk. The last time the actor appeared in the MCU was in the 2022 Disney+ series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law. 


	Ruffalo isn't the only returning star joining Holland's fourth Spider-Man, as Michael Mando (who played the Scorpion in Spider-Man: Homecoming), also joins the cast. It was previously announced that Jon Bernthal will, too, appear in the film as the Punisher. 

	











	Plot details are being kept under wraps, though a standout new addition to the cast is Sadie Sink. Destin Daniel Cretton is directing while Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers return to write the film.


Brand New Day will serve as the long-awaited follow-up to 2021's No Way Home, which saw the world forget that Holland's Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Brand New Day is set to hit theaters July 31, 2026.

The Korean maestro's latest thriller, co-starring local screen royalty Lee Byung-hun and Son Ye-jin, will premiere in competition at the 82nd Venice Film Festival before launching the 30th edition of BIFF.


							By 

	Patrick Brzeski


Asia Bureau Chief


	Arguably, there was no other choice…. The Busan International Film Festival has selected the latest wildly anticipated feature from Korean maestro Park Chan-wook to open its landmark 30th edition on Sept. 17. A black-comedy survival thriller starring Korean leading man Lee Byung-hun, Park's 12th feature, No Other Choice, will have its world premiere in competition at the 82nd Venice Film Festival before heading to Korea's biggest cinema event for its Asian debut.


No Other Choice stars Lee and beloved Korean actress Son Ye-jin as a married couple struggling to hold their family together amid mounting economic desperation. The film follows Man-su (Lee), a once-content middle-class family man who is abruptly laid off from his job, sending him into a spiral of anxiety and desperation. As he scrambles to regain employment and preserve the life he's built, his wife Miri (Son) becomes equally determined to protect their children and home at any cost.

	The project reunites Park with various longtime collaborators and introduces a fresh pairing in its leads — marking the first time Lee and Son, two of Korea's most celebrated stars, have appeared as a couple onscreen. The supporting cast includes Park Hee-soon, Lee Sung-min, Yeom Hye-ran and Cha Seung-won. 


No Other Choice is based on Donald E. Westlake's novel The Ax, which was previously adapted to the screen in French by Costa-Gavras. Park first teased the project during a public appearance at BIFF in 2019, describing it as a long-in-the-making passion project he hoped would come to be seen as his “masterpiece.” The director's many fans are anticipating his signature blend of muscular craftsmanship, elegant mise-en-scène, psychological intensity and moral ambiguity. 

	











	“I am deeply moved and excited to experience the premiere of Park Chan-wook's desired project alongside diverse audiences on the festival's opening day,” said BIFF festival director Jung Hanseok in a statement. “I sincerely hope that its selection will build meaningful momentum to garner greater attention and foster renewed interest in Korean cinema.”


	The selection of No Other Choice underscores BIFF's efforts to champion the vibrancy and global reach of contemporary Korean filmmaking during its landmark 30th anniversary edition, organizers say. The festival runs Sept. 17–26 in the southern port city of Busan.


No Other Choice is Park's first directorial effort since 2022's Decision to Leave, which won him the best director prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Neon has acquired North American distribution rights to the new film. A major awards season push is expected from the hit-making distributor after its breakthrough success with Bong Joon Ho's Parasite.

Sabrina Carpenter got her groove on at Lollapalooza with none other than Earth, Wind & Fire.


	During her Sunday night headlining set, the “Manchild” singer brought out the iconic group, where they performed two of their most beloved hits. Alongside Carpenter, Earth, Wind & Fire hit the stage and gave renditions of the Grammy-nominated track “Let's Groove” and the classic “September.”

	Her Lollapalooza performance comes just ahead of the arrival of her next album, Man's Best Friend. After the release of “Manchild,” a single from the forthcoming record, Carpenter confirmed that her seventh studio album will be out Aug. 29. The track subsequently became her second No. 1 single a few days after she announced Man's Best Friend. 


	Alongside the Grammy winner, Tyler, the Creator, Olivia Rodrigo, Twice, Luke Combs, Rüfüs du Sol, A$AP Rocky, Korn, Gracie Abrams and Doechii headlined Lollapalooza 2025. The festival kicked off Thursday at Grant Park in Chicago, with Sunday marking the final day of the event.

The executive producer also thinks that Bertha (Carrie Coon) may be right about Gladys (Taissa Farmiga) after the explosive penultimate episode of season three.


							By 

	Ronda Racha Penrice



[This story contains major spoilers from season three, episode seven of The Gilded Age, “Ex-Communicated.”]


	The seventh episode of The Gilded Age‘s third season, titled “Ex-Communicated,” literally ended with a bang. Somebody shot George Russell. Or at him. Viewers aren't sure, as we saw a bullet headed for George and then the screen went black. 




The Gilded Age executive producer and director Salli Richardson-Whitfield, who helmed this episode and the finale, is not giving up those goods to The Hollywood Reporter. But she does speak on other pivotal developments, and there are quite a few.

	As harrowing as the prospect of losing George (spectacularly portrayed by Morgan Spector) is, a lot happened in this episode. Ward McAllister (Nathan Lane) released a fictional book about New York society that contained thinly veiled details of the lives of Mrs. Astor (Donna Murphy), Bertha Russell (Carrie Coon) and more, and thought he could just carry on as before. There is a spy in the Russell household who keeps leaking gossip to the papers and the Russells' servants — butler Mr. Church (Jack Gilpin), housekeeper Mrs. Bruce (Celia Keenan-Bolger) and chef Borden (Douglas Sills) — are charged with finding the culprit. Oscar (Blake Ritson) is not handling his friend/lover John Adams' (Claybourne Elder) death well at all, and almost comes out to his mother Agnes (Christine Baranski).

	











	And, as always, matters of the heart continue to rule. While Gladys (Taissa Farmiga) and Hector (Ben Lamb) are getting along much better, Larry (Harry Richardson) is not making much headway with Marian (Louisa Jacobson) to get their engagement back on track. Also Mrs. Kirkland (Phylicia Rashad) meets up with Mrs. Ernestine Brown, portrayed by the legendary Leslie Uggams, and finds out Peggy's darkest secret, which she's sure will force her son Dr. Kirkland (Jordan Donica) to end their courtship.


	With so many couples in agony by the episode's end and only Hector and Gladys appearing happy, could Bertha have been right all along? Richardson-Whitfield lets us know what she thinks.


	***


What happens to George? There was no indication that someone would try to shoot him. So how did we get here?


	At Gilded, we really love these explosive openers and endings in episodes. Oscar's friend just got [killed]. No one saw that coming, and no one sees what happens to George at the end of episode seven.


Literally! But from the very beginning, this episode was explosive with McAllister's tell-all book about the women and society life he has helped cultivate. Yet he's shocked when he's no longer welcomed. Why does he believe he should still have a place at the table? Or at the ball?


	In his mind, he thought he was so entrenched with these people that he would be okay, [Because] he doesn't really give names, he thought that would be enough cover for him. And honestly, I say the same thing: How could he believe that Mrs. Astor would stand for any of this? That particular scene between the two of them when they part ways is very sad and tragic because you can tell that she is truly heartbroken. She doesn't have really, really good friends, and I feel like she felt that McAllister was actually a good friend and this is a big betrayal. I always thought of that scene as a breakup between two lovers, almost. Even though they're not lovers, it was tragic like that for both of them.

	











And how cruelly he spoke of her, throwing her husband's philandering in her face and then saying “oh, forgive me” the next moment.


	It's like that best friend you find out really, truly has felt jealous and despised you all these years. It felt a little bit Atlanta Housewives to me. You think this is your homie, that we ride or die and at the same time, this is really how you see me and pity me and judge me. I think that's why people love this show. It can be such elevated drama, but then feel so soapy and catty. That's the magic of the show. You can sort of have both.


Another really great storyline was the spy in the house. It made the servants more active. Talk about directing that and injecting a little mystery.


	It's not the deepest storyline, but I had so much fun with it because I said, if we're going to do this, then we are going full on Wes Anderson camp. This is going to be so much fun and almost silly, but it works. Our actors embraced the spy[ing] of it, like the idea of [Chef Borden] looking behind the bread. We were laughing the whole time we were shooting. I hope people understand what I'm doing here, because it seems silly. I think people are going to enjoy the little cat and mouse [of it all]. It's another one of those things the show does so well; we can do this great drama and then get super fun camp musical theater.


Let's talk about Oscar. This episode goes into his heartbreak over his “friend” John. How did you capture those tender moments and Oscar's raw emotions, especially during the heart-wrenching living room scene with his mother Agnes, cousin Marian and aunt Ada when he reveals that John has left him a house?












	Blake, who plays Oscar, and I played with different levels when we were shooting. He's a really talented actor. So we we're like, “Let's play this way this time, let's do it with a little more anger at Agnes, with a little more despair, and this time [can] we have a little more shame?” So we could really craft the performance and decide where we wanted to go. But the main thing we thought is that Oscar is usually so reserved, all people are during this time, and this was a time to be real. We could see him have raw emotion and not hold back, and not think about etiquette and what people are going to think about him in this house. And in that moment, you think he might actually tell her that he was in love with that man. I love how Marian was like “Uh, no, no, no, no, you can't go back from here,” because even though Marian's an innocent, she has some suspicions, and she knows that he cannot come back from that with Agnes. If he were to have really told Agnes, she'd probably would have never spoken to him again.


And then Ada senses something and comes to Oscar's aid as well.


	I don't know how much Ada knows, but she knows that this is odd, and we probably shouldn't talk about this. During that time period, it was just better not to speak of it.


We have to backtrack and talk about that moment when Oscar and John's sister Mrs. Bell (Kate Baldwin) meet and she gives him the house by the lake. When she tells Oscar that John left money to pay for the house for five years, he responds, “He thought of everything,” and she says, “He thought of you.”












	Isn't it a beautiful, beautiful scene! What I love is that you've now found these two women, Marian and the sister who do know the nature of the relationship and can give him some grace and love for it, and he doesn't feel so much out there on an island. I was a beautiful moment for our show and acceptance of people and their sexuality during that time period. I always say that Gilded somehow mirrors the world we're living in now. I don't know how Julian does it every year. Obviously, they've written these scripts a while ago by the time the show comes out, but it really mirrors everything still going on in our culture.


In this episode, we also see Gladys and Hector getting even closer after her epic takedown of Lady Sarah at the dinner table in the previous episode. Talk about filming those scenes of Hector and Gladys slowly falling in love with each other.


	Hey, Bertha was right. Mom was right. … She didn't set Gladys up with a monster. She set her up with the life she knows that in the future, [Gladys is] going to thank her for. I decided I'm going to be Bertha. I'm going make sure my daughter's life is good. No, no, I'm just joking. But I think it's all about that Bertha was actually right. There are many times Bertha goes about things the wrong way but she was right. They are suited for each other, and he's a kind man. He just needs a good wife to show him who he is. I love that it's grown into something real, especially after you've seen her at the altar, in tears and then the scene of them in the cabin, and you're like, “What did we put them into?” I think it's one of our best storylines this season.

	











You got to direct Leslie Uggams with Phylicia Rashad!


	I made sure I had a picture with the two of them because I grew up watching these women. They're two living legends. I feel like I've started to accomplish things in my career as a director, but to sit there and get to direct these two women, and they trust me? It'll definitely be a memory that I take with me for the rest of my life. They are still so present and still so good and, again, a delight to work with. There's nothing better than when you meet your idols and they turn out to be good people, too.


And it's a pivotal moment that has the potential to change everything for Peggy and her dashing Dr. Kirkland.


	Everything. Yeah [Mrs. Kirkland] is a troublemaker, and I love her. I love the fact that she's sort of a mixture of Bertha and Agnes in our Black elite world.


Unfortunately, we don't see Larry and Marian come back together. And, in a way, Marian breaking up with Larry seems trivial. Could Larry have really told her? Also, during that time, men didn't tell women much about their comings and goings.


	Yeah, but I think Marian has always wanted something more. She wants more of a modern marriage. She wants to be a partner. I think that's why she and Peggy have become close friends. Both of them want to grow as women too, not just as a wife. Both of them expect more from the people that they're in love with. They expect to be in love and not to be forced into a marriage like Gladys. Marian and Larry, if they're going to come back together, need to find a way to have more of a modern take on what it means to be in love and to be married. So hopefully Larry can figure out what Marian really needs and what he really wants in a marriage. I think it's great to see both sides like we see. And, maybe, again, Bertha was right. Maybe we need more arranged marriages. Maybe our parents do know more. But I think it's nice to see both sides of the coin. You see these two modern women, and then you see someone like Gladys.

The actor details feeling conflicted over his character's key life decision in the film: “I really tried to meditate on that for a very long time.”


							By 

	Lexy Perez


Associate Editor


[This story contains spoilers for Netflix's My Oxford Year.] 


	When portraying King George in Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, Corey Mylchreest left audiences in love and heartbroken after his character's emotional arc. Now the actor is set to once again make the audience swoon and possibly cry in Netflix's My Oxford Year. 



	In the film, directed by Iain Morris and based on Julia Whelan's 2018 novel of the same name, Mylchreest stars as Jamie, an Oxford professor who falls in love with American student Anna (played by Sofia Carson). What begins as a fun fling evolves as the two grow a strong bond built on poetry and literature, before profoundly altering each other's lives and subverting each other's expectations. However, Jamie reveals that he has been secretly battling cancer, the same illness to which he lost his brother, and has made the decision to no longer continue treatment much to his father's protests.

	The choice was one that was complicated for Mylchreest. “I don't know what I would do. I really tried to meditate on that for a very long time, but it takes you to quite a dark place. It's so complicated, but I support him in his decision,” the actor tells The Hollywood Reporter.

	“If you've watched your brother want to let their life end, and undergoes this treatment that really just prolongs and worsens the pain, I think if you've seen that for long enough…think you're one step further to accepting your fate than you would be if you hadn't,” he adds.

	











	In Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, Mylchreest's King George was depicted with a mental illness. Though the series never explicitly stated a diagnosis, it was referred to as “madness.” Now having portrayed another character struggling with an illness Mylchreest reflects, “No one is their illness. It's not a characteristic, it's a circumstance.” Of portraying two roles in which his characters endure illnesses Mylchreest says, “We know that it isn't who they are and you just have to do the same work that you would do anywhere else, which is just figure out who your man is and then do as much research as possible about the illness or whatever there is…. Just do as much research as possible about what it is, and then try and work out how the person that you are beginning to know and understand, how they would react to that.”


	In a conversation with THR, Mylchreest reflects on filming at Oxford, Jamie's complicated relationship with his father, that Coldplay karaoke scene and what he envisions could've been for his character. 


What was it about this story that interested you and made you want to be a part of bringing it to life?


	I guess it's the character of Jamie. He's so multifaceted. He's so three-dimensional. [There are] lots of conflicting things within him, lots of amazing relationships in that film [including] with his parents, with his brother, with the wonderful Anna, yeah, there was just so much to do. And it's such a lovely story as well. Obviously working with Sofia [Carson] was a big pull, as was working with Iain. 

	











How familiar were you already with Oxford?


	I know bits of Oxford, and I've been up and down before to there. It's such a gorgeous city. It's full of history, and the architecture is really lovely and it's really beautiful. It's this really lovely dichotomy between the fact that all of these buildings are so old and they've been there for so long, but they've always been for young people. There's always been this vibrant, youthful energy and purpose to Oxford that is contained within these ancient buildings which is so, so lovely. It was so lovely to film it there as well, because it feels like a big part of the film is the city itself and also the college. It was such a great thing that we got to do it there. We filmed a lot at Magdalen College and on the streets of Oxford.


Anna and Jamie form a connection through their love of literature and poetry. Can you talk about poetry and literature being this foundation for them and how it helped them see each other in a way that others wouldn't?


	I guess in Jamie and Anna, you have two characters who are sort of restricted from their truth, dreams, desires and emotions through things around them. Jamie's family are very old English and England has a culture of suppression of whatever you're truly feeling. But Jamie is so full of feeling and love and everything under the sun and obviously loves poetry to pieces. But it is through his poetry that he's able to further understand himself and the world and express himself as well. The amount of times that he quotes something to get his point across, because it's almost safer in a way to use someone else's words, but also, when the words are so eloquent and fully encapsulating, why would you choose your own? And the same goes for Anna. Poetry is something that has been so dear to her from such a young age. She is on track to a very different life that has been almost planned for her, and it is poetry that connects her to herself, her own dreams [and] her own feelings in a much deeper way. And so you have these two characters that have their own very important and vital to their existence and experience of the world, their relationship to poetry. As with many things, when you share such a devout appreciation of something, when you find someone else who has the same thing, it is a very powerful connecting, catalyst-type thing.

	











With Jamie and Anna's dynamic, Jamie wants things between them to be kept fun given the secret he's keeping but it seems like it took somebody like Anna to challenge Jamie into thinking that maybe there is a person who could understand who he really is and the challenges he's living through. And also maybe vice versa with how Jamie helps Anna. Can you talk about the progression of their relationship?


	What they begin with is a common love and also they are attracted to each other. But also we are deeper understanders of our experience than we are conscious of and I think that both of them are aware of how much the other has what they need, or [that] the other could help them bring out in themselves what they need and, of course, that is what happens. I also think that in a way, the film is a love letter to cross-Atlantic relations, because there is British-isms that Anna takes on but I think specifically, Jamie is in need of a very American outward. Anna is very much “just do it and say it,” whereas Jamie isn't that. If Anna was exactly who she was, but British, they would have broken up because they wouldn't have fought for it. There is also their cultural differences that play into the evolution of their relationship.


 One notable fun scene in the film was the karaoke scene. Did you have a say in the song that Jamie would sing or were you just up for anything and ready to see how it went?












	I was up for anything, but it [the song] was decided beforehand. We actually filmed two versions of that. We filmed it with “Yellow” and we also filmed it with “Careless Whisper” because we didn't know what we would get the rights to. We also filmed two versions of each one with him [the character Jamie] sort of genuinely trying in the beginning [and] trying to do it sort of sincerely, then failing, then going to joke. And then we also did one where he's taken out the whole thing from the beginning. That scene is a very painful one for me to watch. There was a cast and crew screening that I went to yesterday, and I had a hat on, and I pulled my hat down, my T-shirt up, and I literally blocked out my ears. I just can't do it.


Did you feel there were other takes that were better then the one in the film? 


	I understand why they chose that. Because also at that point Jamie — not that there is an upper hand — but has had the upper hand over Anna. He splashed her. I mean, she did get him back in the chip shop but then he also has a whole lecture [and] there is a bit of a power dynamic. I think it was important that in that moment, she gets the upper hand on him, and he doesn't take charge of it. He's in the palm of her hand in that moment. And so I see why they've done it. But God it was so bad. It was also awful doing it.


When we finally learn of Jamie's secret, he shares his reasoning for not wanting to continue treatment for his cancer. He's very set on his choice and doesn't stray from his decision even after finding love with Anna. Can you talk about his decision and unwillingness to waver? Did you agree with it?












	It's so complex, isn't it? It really is, and there's so many things at play, I think. I mean, I don't know. I haven't experienced the closeness of the loss that Jamie had. His brother obviously had the exact same thing and there are some lines that reference it, but in my head it's always good to come up with a backstory and have a detailed imagined reality of what that is. If you've watched your brother want to let their life end, and undergoes this treatment that really just prolongs and worsens the pain, I think if you've seen that for long enough, and there's degradation of their body, the emotional pain, the physical pain that they've gone through, I think you're one step further to accepting your fate than you would be if you hadn't. And also Cecilia (played by Poppy Gilbert) was (Jamie's brother) Eddie's partner and he's seen the loss and the effects with Cecilia. For all of his cynicism, he is a deeply caring man, and it's very little agency that a situation like that gives you, and one of the things that you are able to control is what you leave, the effect on people that you have during those last months. I think he's so dead set on he's not going to leave the world having had a worse impact, having caused pain. For someone who is so optimistic and wonderful, and also for himself, he just doesn't want to go through the awfulness of what he's witnessed. I do agree. I don't know what I would do. I really tried to meditate on that for a very long time, but it takes you to quite a dark place. It's so complicated, but I support him in his decision.

	











Speaking of complicated, we learn about Jamie's strained relationship with his father. His father wants him to keep fighting but Jamie is ready to let nature takes its course and no longer continue treatment. And when you learn their perspectives, there doesn't seem to be a definitive right or wrong perspective because we know why they feel the way they feel. How did you interpret their dynamic? Can you talk about the progression of their relationship?


	I mean, you're so right. They are both right and ultimately, it's so funny, isn't it, because although it will be one person that is suffering or that is diagnosed, it is everyone within their vicinity that is suffering and affected. And in a way, one person is suffering if they are the one that's been diagnosed, [but] at least has an end date, whereas you don't get that if you are a loved one. It's just so complicated and I think one of the things that is best about the film is it really asks that question, and it doesn't try to answer it. It just tries to give as much of both sides as possible, which I think is wonderful. I'm very proud of the film. We have a story of quintessential British boys who just don't talk and need toys often. That's football. I think one of the amazing things about football is that it connects and allows an outlet of hopefully positive emotion that otherwise wouldn't be expressed, because of so much toxic masculinity, effectively. And also [in] the British culture, everyone is suppressed. For them it's toy cars. It's a wonderful dynamic and, and we do see it evolve. At the end, they do thankfully reach an understanding and they just need to remember that they love each other, really. And that's the cause for everything.

	











At the end of the film, we don't necessarily see Jamie die but rather get a snapshot of what could've been with him and Anna traveling. What did you make of the ending? Had Jamie not been sick, what did you envision for what could've been for him and for him and Anna?


	[I] love the ending. I think by the time that we started the shoot, that still wasn't planned. I think they put that in, and I think it's a wonderful idea, and I think they've done it very well. And also, what a pleasure to do that. We just went to all these gorgeous places. So that was an absolute joy. And it was right at the end of the shoot as well, so that the last day we were in Athens.


	I think if he hadn't had his illness, then I think without a doubt he would have stayed at Oxford. He would have become a professor and a lecturer, and very happily done that for a very long time. There's no way that he would have left. And I see the same for Anna. I think they could have had a very happy life there. And hopefully Anna still will.


What do you ultimately hope that people take away from this film and what did you take away from it and this character?


	What a question. I mean, I took away so many things. I think that's one of the joys of doing this ridiculous job. You're being paid to research and develop a really in-depth understanding of what other people are like, and why they are the way that they are, and there's so many things that I'm grateful for about playing Jamie. I think the main thing that I've taken away is the thing that I want everyone to take away, which is that life is so much more nourishing. It's shorter than we think. Not that I'm saying that as a wise old man, it just is and it is best enjoyed in the now. I think the balance in between Anna's philosophy on life and Jamie's philosophy on life is the perfect thing, but planning is something that Matthew McConaughey says, is “conservative early and liberal late,” which is just like, do your planning and then you can be free. Do your work, and then you can relax. I think Anna really plans, and Jamie is very much just go with it. I think somewhere in the middle is the sweet spot, and as long as you're present, then you're OK.

The unusual clip Stewart showed during his set in Charlotte on Tuesday pictured Osbourne taking selfies in heaven with Prince, Bob Marley, Kurt Cobain and more.

	Gil Kaufman



	What was clearly intended as a loving tribute to a beloved fellow English music legend turned sour last week when Rod Stewart's homage to late heavy metal icon Ozzy Osbourne drew rebuke from some commenters. As seen in fan video of the moment, during Stewart's show in Charlotte, N.C. on July 29, the 80-year-old singer posted a bizarre AI-generated video of Osbourne — who died on July 22 at age 76 of undisclosed causes — mugging for selfies in heaven with a variety of fellow deceased pop, rock and hip-hop stars including: Prince, Tina Turner, Bob Marley, Kurt Cobain, Tupac Shakur, Aaliyah, Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, George Michael and XXXTentacion, among others.

	











	The comments on one woman's video said it all: “This… looks like one of the drug induced psychosis that led Ozzy to rehab. Outstanding, 7/10. Could have been a 10 if they randomly added Princess Diana and someone who hasn't died yet,” as well as, “Weekend at Bernie's vibes. Prince didn't even want his music on Spotify and changed his name to a Symbol to protect his intellectual property I'm 100% sure he wouldn't have signed off on Rod Stuart Puppeteering his face for this tacky.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	On X, comments ranged from “We are truly in the end times,” to “I've seen some s–tty AI visuals in concerts but this is a new low” and “This is bizarre for many reasons, not the least of which being the fact that Rod Stewart has performed with Ozzy Osbourne. Instead of blasting AI images of Ozzy in heaven, they could show this real & quite lovely picture of Rod Stewart with his arm around the actual Ozzy Osbourne.”

	











	According to the Charlotte Observer, Stewart ended last week's Ozzy AI tribute by saying, “Very sad. A lot of those people died 'cause of drugs… I'm still here, though!” 


	Since Osbourne's death last month tributes have been pouring in from all over, including more traditional ones from Stewart, who has been dedicating his performances of “Forever Young” to Ozzy at his concerts in the weeks since; on July 22, on Instagram Stewart wrote, “Bey, bye Ozzy. Sleep well, my friend. I'll see you up there — later rather than sooner.”


	Just a few days earlier than the Charlotte stop, during a July 26 show at the XFinity Center in Mansfield, Mass., Stewart dedicated “Forever Young” to Ozzy, saying that “we lost a really, true legend this week in Ozzy… I knew his family very well,” as a photo of Osbourne filled the screen. “I”ll be with you soon… but not too soon,” Stewart quipped before launching into the song as the stage screens filled with colorful, postcard-style images of his band members.


	At press time, spokespeople for Osbourne and Stewart had not returned Billboard‘s request for comment.

Avant Gardner LLC, the operator of New York's troubled club Brooklyn Mirage, has voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The filing was made in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.


	According to a statement provided to Billboard by a representative for Avant Gardner, “the decision to file for Chapter 11 relief follows several months of financial distress, culminating with Avant Gardner being unable to open its newly constructed Mirage event space for the 2025 season.”


	Brooklyn Mirage is part of the Avant Gardner entertainment complex that also includes Great Hall and Kings Hall, both venues that will remain open and operating during the Chapter 11 process. These spaces have also hosted a number of shows that have been unable to happen at Brooklyn Mirage this season, and they will continue to do so for the rest of the year.

	Avant Gardner has received a debtor-in-possession financing commitment from its existing lender. As part of its filings, the company anticipates entering into a stalking horse purchase agreement — an initial bid on the assets of a bankrupt company — pursuant to which the Company will sell its assets to an entity formed and controlled by its existing lender, subject to a court supervised over-bidding process.


	The news is the latest twist in a saga that began in earnest in May, when Brooklyn Mirage was set to open after a substantial remodel. But the opening weekend shows by Sara Landry were nixed after inspectors declined to grant the facility a permit to open. All of this summer's shows at Brooklyn Mirage being subsequently cancelled week by week in the months that have followed. (Artists including Rezz, The Chainsmokers and many more have, as Landry did, moved their performances to other New York City venues.)


	Amid the turmoil, it was announced that Josh Wyatt would no longer serve as CEO of the club's parent company, with Gary Richards, Avant Gardner's non-executive chairman of the board, stepping in as the company's new CEO to stabilize the company's finances and bring back Brooklyn Mirage for 2026 and beyond.


	“The Avant Gardner event complex is a truly special music venue that has provided cutting edge experiences over the years for artists and fans from all around the globe,” Richards says in a statement. “Everyone I speak to has had the best sets and very special memories at the Brooklyn Mirage. Two months ago I was brought in as CEO to rebuild the company's culture and turn the business around. I believe this Chapter 11 restructuring is the most viable path forward — it will allow us to stabilize Avant Gardner and focus on building for the future.”

The president also wrote once again that the pop superstar is ""NO LONGER HOT.""


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Donald Trump has once again insulted Taylor Swift, this time dragging the pop superstar's name into a discussion about Sydney Sweeney's widely criticized ad campaign with American Eagle. 


	In a heated post on Truth Social on Monday (Aug. 4), the president compared the two women's politics in an attempt to prove that conservative women are more “hot.” “Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST' ad out there,” he wrote. “It's for American Eagle, and the jeans are ‘flying off the shelves. Go get ‘em Sydney!”

	











	Though the Euphoria star has not commented on it publicly, a recent piece from BuzzFeed reported that she has been a registered Republican since 2024, when Trump won his second of three presidential runs. The report came shortly after Sweeney made headlines for her controversial American Eagle commercials, in which the actress — who is a white woman with blonde hair and blue eyes — boasted about having both “great jeans” and “great genes” — something that upset many consumers who compared the ad's messaging to Nazi propaganda.


	Trump, however, is clearly a fan of the campaign. As for Swift, who has opposed his policies numerous times, the twice-impeached POTUS wrote Monday, “Just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift.” 


	“Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can't stand her (HATE!),” he continued. “She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT. The tide has seriously turned — Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

	











Billboard has reached out to Swift's rep for comment.


	Trump's message is far from the first time he's dissed the 14-time Grammy winner. Her first time speaking about politics was to endorse Democratic candidate Phil Bresden for Senate in 2018, shortly after which the president said he liked her music “25% less.”


	In the years since, Trump's attacks on the singer have heated up as she's repeatedly endorsed his opponents for president, most recently backing Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. A few days after she posted in support of the former VP, he wrote on Truth Social, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” And this past February, he claimed that fans at the Super Bowl booed her “out of the stadium,” when, in reality, the musician stayed for the entire game and only received boos from a few Philadelphia Eagles fans who were this year's rivals to Swift's team of choice, the Kansas City Chiefs.


	In May, Trump again lobbed insults at Swift, posting out of the blue: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,' she's no longer ‘HOT?'”


	It's unclear why, months later, Trump is bringing the Eras Tour headliner back up on his social media platform, or how she's related to the controversy surrounding Sweeney and American Eagle. The fashion brand, for it's part, recently responded to the backlash, posting a statement on Instagram asserting that the campaign “is and always was about the jeans.”


	“We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way,” the company added on Aug. 1. “Great jeans look good on everyone.”

""Sometimes you're so brave and you can get on stage, and it's overwhelming,"" Perry told the crowd. ""I understand that feeling.""

	Gary Graff



Katy Perry‘s Lifetimes Tour stop in Detroit turned a bit more dramatic than planned on Sunday night.


	A young girl collapsed mid-show during Perry's nightly ritual of bringing a few fans on stage to help her perform her 2011 single “The One That Got Away.” 


	The fan, named McKenna, was spotted by Perry sitting in the very top corner of Little Caesars Arena, via a bright blue sequined skirt she was wearing. Perry even waited for her and a friend who came with her to make the long trip down to the floor level and embraced both as they came on stage, McKenna clearly overcome with emotion for being chosen.

	She fainted as Perry prepared to start the song and was immediately attended to by members of the singer's crew and venue medical staff; a visibly concerned Perry knelt alongside her as the crowd of about 13,000 chanted McKenna's name in support.

	She was taken from the stage, after which Katy pulled the other three young fans into a group hug and led a prayer, saying, “Dear God, we pray for McKenna, that she will come back fully and brighter and better than ever. Amen.”

	Perry also remarked that, “It's so much. Sometimes you're so brave and you can get on stage, and it's overwhelming. I understand that feeling.”




	Perry then performed “The One That Got Away” and ushered the other three fans back off the stage. A short time later, while riding a giant butterfly prop above the crowd, she reported that, “McKenna's doing great, by the way,” which was also confirmed to Billboard by backstage sources. Perry also shouted the fan's name at the end of the song.


	Sunday's show was the 13th in the latest North American Leg of the Lifetimes Tour, which Perry kicked off during late April in Mexico City. The tour next stops Tuesday and Wednesday, Aug. 5-6, in Toronto and will run through Dec. 7 in Abu Dhabi.

The veteran R&B act ran through two of their most iconic hits with the ""Espresso"" singer on Sunday night (Aug. 3) in Chicago.

	Gil Kaufman



Sabrina Carpenter had a surprise trick up her sleeve during her headlining set at Lollapalooza in Chicago on Sunday night (Aug. 3). The “Manchild” singer wowed the massive crowd gathered around the T-Mobile main stage — while A$AP Rocky did the same on the opposite end of the park on the Bud Light stage — by treating them to a special mini-set from R&B legends Earth, Wind & Fire.


	“And we can just let loose, right? We can just groove,” Carpenter, wearing a sparkly pink jumpsuit with her name across the chest said as the strains of EW&F's 1981 Billboard Hot 100 No. 3 disco pop classic, “Let's Groove,” bubbled up behind her. “So I thought, ‘why not bring out my friends from Chicago?' Give it up for Earth, Wind & Fire!” she screamed as members of the iconic group joined her on stage to sing the song's familiar refrain.

	“Let this groove, get you to move, alright/ Let this groove set in your shoes, stand up, alright,” singer Philip Bailey crooned in his signature falsetto. Carpenter spun in circles and shook it out to the song's familiar funk pop groove, mouthing along and then joining in on the “move yourself and glide like a 747” verse with a gigantic smile on her face as she doubled up Bailey's vocals on the chorus.




	The mini-set also featured a run through EW&F's perennial fall classic and 1979 Hot 100 No. 8 smash “September,” with a bright brass assist from the band's horn section. “I'm gonna join the band, guys!” Carpenter enthused after the unexpected collab. Sunday's Lolla lineup also featured sets from Mariah the Scientist, Remi Wolf, Finneas, Dominic Fike and Martin Garrix.


	Carpenter's upcoming seventh studio album, Man's Best Friend, is due out on Aug. 29, with the singer revealing the full track list last week with some help from an adorable golden retriever puppy.

The singer said after some tests she checked herself out and will ""continue the investigation as an outpatient.""

Jessie J found herself unexpectedly back in the hospital recently after surgery to treat breast cancer. According to E! News, in an Instagram Story on Saturday (Aug. 2), the 37-year-old singer born Jessie Ellen Cornish revealed that six weeks after surgery she was back in the hospital due to an unexplained health issue.

	“How I spent the last 24 hours,” Jessie wrote on her Story along with photo in which she had an IV in her arm. “6 weeks post surgery and I was back in the same ward I was after my surgery. Not expected or planned. I had and still have symptoms that pointed towards a blood clot on the lung. IT IS NOT A BLOOD CLOT THANK GOD.”

	Noting that her doctors were able to identify the infection, Jessie said she decided to finish her recovery at home. “They ran a lot of tests which ended up showing I have an infection (still trying to figure out what) and a little fluid on my lungs,” she said. “Finding it hard to breathe in, but I discharged myself last night (I hate being in hospital) and will continue the investigation as an outpatient.”


	In a Story on Sunday (Aug. 3), the “Bang Bang” singer provided an update, writing, “I finally got a diagnosis of what's been going on. Lots of people have been asking, apparently it's called… Dramatic? I think that's the spelling. My symptoms are the same and no idea what's wrong yet. But my sarcasm and sense of humour are holding on.” 

	











	The singer also shared a selfie video from bed, noting that it was the first “real time” clip she'd posted since surgery, as she's not been thinking about making content, but rather taking it easy. “I think people think that I'm like hanging on by a thread… which in some moments has felt that way,” she said. “Like two or three days ago when I woke up and I couldn't breathe. I still have pain in my chest when I breathe, but it's not as bad.” 


	She added that she has “very few other symptoms” now, which makes her hopeful that it was just a “viral p–s take.” The good news was that she was feeling a lot stronger and, as counseled by so many, she is resting. She also thanked her mom for being her rock, as well as friends and family who've come over to play with her two-year-old son, Sky, or who've popped in to do a load of laundry for her. 


	“I'm very grateful for my little gang,” she said. 


	In early July, Jessie was also sharing some gratitude after test results revealed no evidence of cancer spread a month after her breast cancer diagnosis in June. “AND. I AM OK. Results = I have NO cancer spread. Happy tears are real. Thank YOU for the prayers, the love, the well wishes, the joy and all the positive energy,” she said in the caption to an Instagram video. 


	Jessie initially underwent surgery on June 23, initially telling fans her cancer was “all gone” post-operation, then later clarifying that she was awaiting test results to confirm. “Lots of healing to go and one more surgery to make these cousins look more like sisters, but for now it's gratitude time,” she added in a latest post about her mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery. “I am changing my name to The LopJess monster.”

			By Melanie Goodfellow, Andreas Wiseman 


EXCLUSIVE: Djimon Hounsou and Halle Berry have signed for Africa-set trafficking thriller Red Card, taking its protagonists on a journey from the rolling grasslands of Kenya's Maasai Mara to the Moroccan port city of Casablanca.  Joel Souza will direct the movie from a screenplay written by Bad Boys creator and Midnight Run writer George Gallo as well as Green Book Academy Award winning screenwriter Nick Vallelonga. The original story, based on real events out of Africa, comes from Ava Roosevelt, Robert Menzies and Michael J. Hershman. Hounsou will star as Max Elmi, a veteran ranger battling poachers in Kenya who joins forces with Dane Harris, a tenacious special agent and part of a team led by FBI supervisor Amanda Bruckner (Berry) working with international law enforcement to fight trafficking rings abroad. When Max's son, a talented soccer player, falls prey to a deceitful sports agent and disappears into the criminal underworld of North Africa, Max will stop at nothing to find his child, and Dane will have to decide how far he's willing to go. Their odyssey takes them from the quiet Maasai villages of Kenya to simmering streets of Casablanca in Morocco. The film is endorsed by the National Centre for Missing & Exploited Children and backed by the Soloviev Foundation. Hounsou is a two-time Academy Award nominee for Blood Diamond and In America as well as Golden Globe nominee for Amistad, with other credits including Gladiator, Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain Marvel, A Quiet Place Part II and A Quiet Place: Day One.   Berry made history as the first African-American woman to win the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Marc Forster's Monster's Ball (2002), and won Emmy and Golden Globe awards for her portrayal of Dorothy Dandridge in the television film Introducing Dorothy Dandridge.

News Corp. said Monday that it plans to launch the California Post, a Los Angeles-based tabloid with the flavor of the New York Post, early next year.


	Robert Thomson, CEO of News Corp., said, per the Post, “Los Angeles and California surely need a daily dose of The Post as an antidote to the jaundiced, jaded journalism that has sadly proliferated. We are at a pivotal moment for the city and the state, and there is no doubt that The Post will play a crucial role in engaging and enlightening readers, who are starved of serious reporting and puckish wit.”


	According to the announcement, the new publication will feature a dedicated staff of reporters and photographers, with the team in New York providing national and international news. The publication will have a print edition and a dedicated home page. Nick Papps will serve as editor in chief. New York Post editor in chief Keith Poole will expand his oversight at New York Post Media Group, which also includes Page Six and the Decider.

	The launch of a new publication in Los Angeles comes as its signature daily, the Los Angeles Times, has struggled, with downsizing of staff and revenue losses. Its owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, recently announced plans to take the Times public, with the new entity pursuing Regulation A+ financing, which allows for raising of capital from investors exempt from some of the regulatory requirements of a traditional IPO.

The Post is not real news. They've completely ignored any Epstein-related stories. They're only focusing on Mamdani being “evil” or something.

Yes, please! Funniest headlines in the country.

					By Dade Hayes 

Business Editor


Amazon has reorganized its audio divisions, laying off more than 100 workers and dramatically narrowing the scope of its Wondery studio.


	Among those exiting in the strategic shift is Wondery CEO Jen Sargent. Marshall Lewy, who has headed up content at Wondery, is moving over to Audible, Amazon's Newark, NJ-based subsidiary.


	Narrative podcasts under Wondery's banner will be integrated into Audible. Personality-driven talk shows like Travis and Jason Kelce's New Heights will either go to Audible or be managed by a newly formed “creator services” team.

	The news was first reported by Bloomberg and confirmed to Deadline by a person familiar with the situation.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	While Wondery had landed a number of top podcast names, including the Kelces and LeBron James, and also developed a string of podcasts that became fodder for film and TV adaptations, it faces some formidable competition. Spotify and YouTube are major tech rivals in the podcast space, with ample resources at their disposal.


	The Wondery brand will continue to be used in association with certain podcasts, including New Heights and Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert.


Amazon acquired Wondery in 2020, 12 years after buying Audible. While the latter was initially focused on audio books, it later branched into podcasts.


	Podcast advertising revenue is expected to reach $2.5 billion this year and top $3 billion by 2028, according to a forecast by research firm eMarketer. Audio ads, from not only podcasts but Amazon Music, has been an increasingly prominent theme in Amazon's annual upfront presentations to advertisers. The tech giant has emphasized its Alexa voice assistant as an enhancement to audio ad campaigns.

	











	Steve Boom, VP Audio, Twitch and Games for Amazon, addressed the evolving business environment in his memo to employees explaining the moves.


	“The podcast landscape has evolved significantly over the past few years,” he wrote. “As video podcasting has grown in popularity, we have learned that creator-led, video-integrated shows have different audience needs and require distinct discovery, growth and monetization strategies compared to audio-first, narrative series. The rise of video has also blurred the lines on what it means to be a podcast creator. As a result, we have adapted to meet creators' needs across several ATG businesses, with deep relationships not only at Wondery, but also at Audible, Twitch, Amazon Music, Games, and Talent Services.


	“In light of these learnings, we've decided the best and most efficient way to serve customers is by separating the teams that oversee Wondery's narrative podcast efforts from those developing its creator-led shows, and by consolidating those divisions into other ATG businesses that have shared capabilities.”


	Here is Boom's full memo:

All, Wondery joined Amazon in 2021 to bring their unparalleled expertise in narrative podcasts in-house and to provide even more high-quality, innovative content to audiences wherever they listen. Since then, Wondery has continued its track record of producing chart-topping and award-winning narrative podcasts (including Podcast of the Year wins in 2021, 2022 and 2025). Wondery also expanded its presence into video-forward, creator-led podcasts, working with some of the world's culture-moving talent. As a result, more customers are listening to Wondery content than ever before, and podcast revenue has grown by more than 4x. The podcast landscape has evolved significantly over the past few years. As video podcasting has grown in popularity, we have learned that creator-led, video-integrated shows have different audience needs and require distinct discovery, growth and monetization strategies compared to audio-first, narrative series. The rise of video has also blurred the lines on what it means to be a podcast creator. As a result, we have adapted to meet creators' needs across several ATG businesses, with deep relationships not only at Wondery, but also at Audible, Twitch, Amazon Music, Games, and Talent Services.In light of these learnings, we've decided the best and most efficient way to serve customers is by separating the teams that oversee Wondery's narrative podcast efforts from those developing its creator-led shows, and by consolidating those divisions into other ATG businesses that have shared capabilities. These changes will not only better align our teams as they work to take advantage of the strategic opportunities ahead but, even more crucially, will ensure we have the right structure in place to deliver the very best experience to creators, customers and advertisers. Unfortunately, these changes also include some role reductions, and we have notified those employees this morning. The following changes to our organization are effective today:Narrative Podcasts will move to AudibleWe will combine Wondery's narrative podcast studio (including its slate of award-winning podcasts such as Dr. Death, American Scandal, and Business Wars) with Audible. This integration will strengthen Audible's position as a leader in immersive and premium audio content, while continuing to invest in the quality series that Wondery and Audible listeners have come to expect. Coinciding with this change, the Wondery+ subscription will also move under Audible (with more details to come later this year). Wondery's Chief Content Officer Marshall Lewy will be joining Audible's content team. The newly combined team will report throughout the Audible organization. Wondery's creator-led content team will move to Creator ServicesThe team responsible for Wondery's creator-led podcast studio and shows will join our Talent Services team, forming a new organization we will call Creator Services. This change unites Wondery's growing slate of hit creator-led shows (including Mind the Game, New Heights, Armchair Expert) with Talent Services' portfolio of strategic deals that span multiple businesses across Amazon. This new team will continue to operate our creator-led podcast studio under the Wondery brand, working with a select number of top creators to drive scaled listenership and unlock broader and long-lasting relationships across Amazon. Creator Services will be led by Matt Sandler, who will continue reporting to me.Ads & Monetization for Wondery and Amazon Music We see a bigger opportunity to help creators maximize revenue through advertising and sponsorship, so I am creating a new team responsible for sponsorship advertising across Wondery and Amazon Music. This team will be led by Angie More, who will report to me. Angie has done an incredible job scaling Wondery's brand advertising and sponsorship sales to-date, and she and her existing Wondery advertising team will continue to work closely with Amazon Ads to onboard new advertisers to Amazon. Amy Grabisch and her team, who are currently responsible for monetizing Amazon Music's live programming, will move to this new org. This integrated approach will make it easier for advertisers to work with Amazon shows, creators, and IP, and I am excited to see what this team can accomplish in this space. As a result of all these changes, Jen Sargent will be moving on to pursue new opportunities but will be helping us through this transition. I'd like to thank Jen for her leadership of Wondery and her partnership with me and the ATG leadership team throughout the past four years. Upon acquisition, Jen stepped up into the CEO role and has led Wondery through many impressive milestones. Under Jen's leadership, Wondery has produced chart-topping and award-winning narrative podcasts, resulting in 84 #1 hits globally across Apple and Spotify. Jen has also led the team through seven successful podcast-to-TV series adaptations (including the recent Emmy-nominated series on FX, Dying for Sex), and has expanded Wondery's presence into the successful creator-led podcasts we have today. Jen's leadership has been instrumental in Wondery's success, and we are grateful for her ongoing support and perspective. While this is the right organizational structure for the future success of the business, our partners, and our customers, in conjunction with these changes we've made the difficult decision to reduce some roles within Wondery. We have notified colleagues whose roles were impacted across the org in North America and Costa Rica, and we are dedicated to handling this transition with care and respect. In other countries, we are following the required legal procedures which require additional time and steps, and we will communicate with affected employees in those regions accordingly. To those of you impacted, I want to sincerely thank you for all your hard work and dedication to the Wondery business, to our team, and to our customers. Your creativity, dedication, and hard work have helped establish Amazon as a leader in audio entertainment and creator partnerships.  We are working on an individual level to ensure all impacted employees are given the support they need, including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits and more. Your HRBPs are available for conversations, and we have a licensed counselor available 24/7 through our Employee Assistance Program (U.S. Phone: 1-833-721-2323). To those continuing with us on this next chapter, additional communication will be shared from your leadership team this week. We're proud of the work we've done together, and we remain excited about what lies ahead for Wondery, Creator Services, and Audible, as we focus on building for creators and customers.Steve

					By Stewart Clarke 




EXCLUSIVE: James Norton and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau‘s King & Conqueror will play on Prime Video in the U.S. and HBO Max in a slew of territories after Paramount Global sealed a raft of deals for the soon-to-launch historical epic.


	The drama stars Norton as Harold, Earl of Wessex, opposite Coster-Waldau as William, Duke of Normandy, two men destined to clash at the Battle of Hastings. Emily Beecham plays Edith Swan-neck and Clémence Poésy stars as Matilda, their respective wives. The drama tells the story of the people, dynasties and events that went on to shape history.

	The series is produced by Rabbit Track Pictures, the label that Norton runs with Kitty Kaletsky, alongside The Development Partnership, Shepherd Content, RVK Studios and CBS Studios, in association with the BBC, which has the UK rights and launches the show later this month. The first trailer dropped last week.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Paramount Global Content Distribution is across sales and has racked up deals spanning over 100 territories. Prime Video has taken it for the U.S. and HBO Max will show the 1066 drama in the Nordics, Iberia, Southeast Asia, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.


	PGCD held a packed buyers-only screening for King & Conqueror – the opening episode of which is directed by Baltasar Kormákur – at the London Screenings in February.


	It clearly struck a chord with the assembled acquisitions folk. SBS has acquired it for Australia and JioHotstar for India. It has also sold to buyers including Showcase and StackTV (Canada), M-Net (Africa), Streamz and Be TV (Belgium), Cosmote TV (Greece), Yes and Hot (Israel), Sky NZ (New Zealand), and LRT (Lithuania).

	











	The deals come ahead of a glitzy London premiere for the series, next week.


	“King & Conqueror is a sweeping, cinematic drama with global appeal, and we're thrilled to see such strong demand from leading platforms around the world,” says Lisa Kramer, President of International Content Licensing at PGCD. “Compelling storytelling, exceptional cast, and bold creative vision make it a standout series that resonates across markets and cultures.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Outlander: Blood Of My Blood doubles the pleasure","https://www.avclub.com/outlander-blood-of-my-blood-review-starz-tv","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

When Starz first announced Outlander: Blood Of My Blood, a new prequel to its globally popular historical-fiction romance series, it wasn't completely truthful in its pitch. Fans have been lapping up the love story of Claire (Caitriona Balfe) and Jamie (Sam Heughan) for seven seasons (and nine books by Diana Gabaldon), but would they follow the origin story of the parents of those lovebirds with the same fervor? 

The prequel's log line circulated in 2024 when the production began, explaining that the show chronicles Jamie's folks in Scotland in the 18th century and Claire's during World War I in England. Early footage of the series reinforced this setup, blending the familiar images of Highland tartan as far as the eye can see with those of war.

But as it turns out, this was a half truth. As spoiled by the trailer, this story does indeed follow the passionate courtship between Jamie's Highland parents—Brian (Jamie Roy) and Ellen (Harriet Slater)—as they throw caution to the misty mountains and pursue a romance that further boils the bad blood between their families. But Starz held back that while some of the tale of Claire's mom and dad—Julia (Hermione Corfield) and Henry (Jeremy Irvine)—takes place during and after World War I, most of it unfolds right alongside Brian and Ellen's story in 1714. Turns out that little story of how Claire's parents died when she was a child left out that the young couple actually time traveled through the same stone circle their then-five-year-old daughter later would.

This is a rather convenient, albeit clever, caveat to a narrative fans have long thought they knew, an asterisk to Gabaldon's mythology that smartly retains the DNA of the original story. From the outset, the original series wielded Claire's 20th-century sensibilities to stoke a cultural clash with her new life in the 1740s, and with Blood Of My Blood (which has already been renewed for a second season), it's a case of like daughter like parents.

But what Julia and Henry find themselves entangled with in the past is not something Starz would like spoiled quite yet. What can be said is that Blood Of My Blood is incredibly nimble in its approach to marrying this double-the-pleasure setup. Fans fearful of the lack of Claire and Jamie needn't worry because there are two couples now. And structurally, the series wisely alternates its focus each episode between those central pairings, while still letting the benched duo flutter in and out of the story to show just how close their respective journeys are. All four of the main lovers are intriguing additions to the universe, if not uncanny spitting images of their future children. It's actually quite surreal how much Roy looks like he was chiseled from the same stone as Heughan and how Corfield imbues Julia's internal narration with the same delicacy as Balfe. Corfield and Slater are standouts in the six episodes provided to critics, with Slater, specifically, carrying much of the emotional weight of the premiere on her shoulders as she serves as the entry point for the wayward MacKenzie clan. 

For longtime Outlander viewers, there is an undeniable thrill in seeing the lives of our central lovers' parents intersect—especially given how they have never been seen in the OG series, save for an elder Brian. This invites the question of what butterfly-effect consequences might their intersecting lives have had on the future we know. It also grants watchers the voyeuristic satisfaction of reuniting with the younger versions of the characters they have spent time with, a degree of fan service that never feels gratuitous. The feud between Dougal (Sam Retford) and Collum (Séamus McLean Ross), and the unofficial brotherhood between Brian and Murtaugh (Rory Alexander), are among the intriguing dynamics characters in the original show could only speak of in the past tense.



But are these thrills sustainable for another decade-long run? With the uncharted waters of Julia and Henry's story, paired with the steamy love affair between Brian and Ellen, there is enough here to engage the fanbase in a fresh way. Up until now, if someone really wanted to know what happens next for Claire and Jamie, they could always crack open Gabaldon's tomes (save for that show-invented twist that closed out season seven). But with Blood Of My Blood, they will have to rely on the authorship of showrunner Matthew B. Roberts more than ever to steer the ship under Gabaldon's guidance. 

That may be the most appealing thing at work in this show: the uncertainty. The hallmarks of the Outlander experience are still here, with separated lovers desperately searching for each other and brooding men going to war rather than acknowledging their feelings. Scotland is finally back at the forefront, something viewers have been clamoring for since Claire and Jamie followed the historically accurate route to the American Colonies. And just like with the original, you'll have to turn on the subtitles to have a fighting chance with the Scottish drawls. 

But more than just a mirror of what's been, Blood Of My Blood is a towering romance that wastes no time proving it has impressive command over its two-is-better-than-one setup. Even as the preamble to a story on its way out, the series confidently debuts as a moving and frankly hot addition to an already deeply felt universe of storytelling. It puts diehard fans' knowledge of the lore to the test and welcomes more casual viewers into a tale that isn't always reliant on what will happen 30 years down the road. Plus, the sex is back in full force. What more can you ask for, Sassenach?   

Outlander: Blood Of My Blood premieres August 8 on Starz

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Eddie Murphy holds his own performance hostage in heist comedy The Pickup","https://www.avclub.com/the-pickup-review","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

Bill Murray has a reputation of being difficult to get on to a movie set: difficult to get ahold of, difficult to provide a firm “yes” (or any answer at all), difficult to ensure he'll make it to shooting, and sometimes difficult to make sure he'll behave properly once he arrives. But there are times when it seems trickier to coax another Saturday Night Live legend turned beloved movie star into actually showing up for his films. By all accounts, Eddie Murphy will cooperate in the sense of accepting a job (presumably through the traditional channels) and hitting his marks as expected. In the streaming era, he seems downright eager to work, having made half a dozen movies for Amazon and Netflix in as many years. But the movies where Murphy well and truly shows up are fewer and further between. Dolemite Is My Name? He's there with bells on. That Saturday Night Live hosting gig clearly had his full attention. The Pickup, a heist comedy pairing Murphy with fellow SNL star Pete Davidson, spends its entire 94-minute runtime idling with its door open, waiting for its star to actually jump in.

Murphy plays Russell Pierce, an armored truck driver about to celebrate his anniversary with his wife Natalie (Eva Longoria). Their kids are grown and out of the house, and Natalie wants Russell to finally retire from his high-stress job so they can start up that bed and breakfast they've always dreamed of. Russell claims he wants to, but he's also comfortable in his job. He's a pro, and secretly apprehensive about making a late-life “pivot,” as the characters say. So in the meantime, Natalie may have to settle for him simply making it to their anniversary dinner on time. He makes this clear when he's paired with Travis Stolly (Pete Davidson), a sloppy if enthusiastic young co-worker, for the first time. But their day's run derails thanks to Zoe (Keke Palmer), a vivacious young woman who Travis has recently met and considers a strong romantic prospect. Zoe has other plans for Travis—and for the money his security service is picking up from an Atlantic City casino.

Murphy is basically in the Denzel Washington role from Unstoppable, with Davidson in the Chris Pine part as the mouthy youngster who must prove his worth to the experienced veteran. This would make Palmer the runaway train. All of that sounds good, especially to Davidson, who transfers his obvious glee at sharing scenes with Eddie Murphy into his character's somewhat less understandable awe at hanging out with Russell. Davidson also does an admirable job at hiding any disappointment over how zipless The Pickup turns out to be.

How did this happen? The cast is sitting right there in the open, a score far easier than any of the movie's cash. (Well, mostly. Eva Longoria simply isn't funny. She wasn't funny attempting self-parody on Only Murders In The Building; she's not funny as a cutesy fiery-Latina stereotype here.) The obvious conclusion is to blame director Tim Story, a prolific and genre-hopping workhorse whose laboring for affability has become a grim trademark. His best movies, produced two decades apart, are Barbershop and The Blackening, both charming ensemble comedies dependent on cast chemistry. When you're starring in a Tim Story movie, you can't assume that spectacle, well-blocked action sequences, or tight pacing will save the day. You have to bring something to it. Murphy does not. He seems perpetually on the verge of quiet-quitting The Pickup, despite his producing credit.

Maybe it's not fair to blame the biggest star in the cast. But Davidson is far less experienced (and seems far more amped), while Palmer does her best to carry her character's shameless sympathy-plea backstory. There's something oddly withholding, meanwhile, about one of the funniest guys of all time resolutely not enlivening a stock older-cranky-guy part. Every 15 minutes or so, Murphy will come briefly to life with an outburst of anger or panic, offering a glimpse of what it might have been like to see him riff more freely with younger folks like Davidson and Palmer, as well as proof that yes, he can still get laughs from something as rote as complaining about back pain or doing a “dorky white guy” voice. These moments are just infrequent enough to feel a little perverse, as if he's waiting for someone to accidentally utter undisclosed magic words before sharing his gift. Evidently Brett Ratner hit upon them more frequently over a decade ago when making Tower Heist, a similarly slack caper with a much funnier Murphy performance.

Maybe Murphy truly believed in this laugh-deficient screenplay and simply wanted to make a grounded contribution to an entertaining heist thriller, in which case he made a bad bet. The Pickup is entertaining on that most basic of slack-jawed levels: It has likable stars doing movie stuff (car chases, elaborate deceptions) that the movie seems to bank on blurring into memories of other, better capers. This is a film that will appear on a streaming service, looking like a good-enough option for a relaxing night in—and rather than delivering much of anything, everyone involved seems to want a lot of credit just for showing up.

Writers: Matt Mider, Kevin Burrows

An Oasis concertgoer reportedly and tragically fell to his death at the band's Wembley Stadium reunion show on Saturday night. Per The Mirror, a man in his 40s dropped from the upper tier of the stadium during the concert and was pronounced dead at the scene, with officers present saying the man was found with “injuries consistent with a fall.” In the hours since his death, Oasis has issued a statement. “We are shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic death of a fan at the show last night,” the group said. “Oasis would like to extend our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the person involved.”

Fans on social media commiserated over witnessing the tragedy, including one who claimed to have suffered a “panic attack” from the sight. Another said, “At first glance, I thought it was a coat falling from the above tier, but then I looked and saw the bloke on the concrete. It was horrific to see.”

The band's sold-out Saturday night performance at the 90,000-person stadium was the fourth of seven shows the band will play at Wembley this year. Tonight, August 3, will be the final Wembley Stadium concert until the end of September. A spokesperson for the venue has said that tonight's concert will go on as planned.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","R.I.P. Loni Anderson, WKRP In Cincinnati's savvy receptionist","https://www.avclub.com/loni-anderson-obituary","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 02:26:00 GMT","

Loni Anderson has died. Best known as Jennifer Marlowe, WKRP In Cincinnati's beautiful and unflappable receptionist, Anderson died from a “prolonged” illness, her publicist, Cheryl J. Kagan, told AP. She was 79.

“We are heartbroken to announce the passing of our dear wife, mother, and grandmother,” Anderson's family said in a statement.

Born on August 5, 1945, in St. Paul, Minnesota, Anderson began performing musical theater at 10. She would later attend the University of Minnesota and finish runner-up in the 1964 Miss Minnesota pageant. Shortly after, she married her first husband, Bruce Hasselberg, and the couple had a daughter, Diedra. They were divorced by 1966.

Anderson moved to L.A., dyed her hair blonde, and broke onto television in 1975. She quickly found roles on S.W.A.T., Barnaby Jones, The Love Boat, and The Bob Newhart Show. Before losing the role to Suzanne Somers, Anderson auditioned for the role of Chrissie on Three's Company. Picking up on Anderson's innate savviness, John Ritter later said, “No one would believe she couldn't live in her own apartment.”

In 1978, she landed the role of Jennifer Marlowe on WKRP In Cincinnati, where she quickly became the object of the beleaguered station's affections. As the assertive and confident receptionist, Anderson challenged “dumb blonde” stereotypes by shrugging off her co-workers' come-ons and casually putting them in their place. That's not to say she couldn't play into the stereotypes when the situation called for it. Still, Anderson always appeared in control, commanding and earning the respect of the “Big Guy,” Arthur Carlson (Gordon Jump), who relies on Jennifer to deflect calls. She may not take dictation or make coffee, but the station was in Jennifer's capable hands for 89 episodes. Anderson received two Emmy Award nominations and three Golden Globe nominations for her performance.

Though her star rose on WKRP, the show never broke out of its cult appeal. Anderson began to diversify into made-for-TV movies, particularly in the 1980 Jayne Mansfield biopic, The Jayne Mansfield Story, opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger as her bodybuilder husband Mickey Hartigay. She would later star as the similarly tragic Hollywood figure Thelma Todd in White Hot: The Mysterious Murder Of Thelma Todd.

After WKRP's cancellation in 1982, Anderson starred in the NASCAR action-comedy Stroker Ace with Burt Reynolds. Afterwards, Anderson began a tumultuous relationship with Reynolds, and in 1988, they adopted a son, Quinton. Together, she and Reynolds starred in the Don Bluth animated hit All Dogs Go To Heaven, but by 1993, their imploding marriage and subsequent divorce became a tabloid fixture. During this time, Anderson struggled to establish a new foothold on TV, starring in shows doomed to quick cancellation, like Partners In Crime with Lynda Carter, Easy Street, and the Empty Nest spin-off, Nurses. She reprised the role of Jennifer Marlowe for two episodes of The New WKRP In Cincinnati and made guest appearances on Melrose Place and Sabrina The Teenage Witch. Her memoir, My Life In High Heels, came out in 1995, and she shared her final TV appearance with Morgan Fairchild, Donna Mills, and Nicollette Sheridan on Lifetime's 2023 special Ladies Of The 80s: A Divas Christmas.

Anderson is survived by her fourth husband, Bob Flick, her son and daughter, two grandchildren, one step-son, and two step-grandchildren.

The Associated Press announced on the evening of Sunday, August 3, 2025 that drama actress Loni Anderson passed away earlier that day. She was 79. AP says they learned from the star's publicist that she died in a Los Angeles hospital after an illness they called “prolonged.”

The outlet also quoted a statement put out by Anderson's family which reads, “We are heartbroken to announce the passing of our dear wife, mother and grandmother.” 

Anderson was best known for her role as Jennifer Marlowe in “WKRP in Cincinnati,” which ABC says aired from 1978 to 1982. 

Loni Anderson's cause of death is unknown at this point. 

Anderson was married a total of four times, according to People. Her most high-profile relationship was with Burt Reynolds, whom she married in 1988. The outlet says the pair met five years prior on the set of “Stroker Ace,” where they fell in love.

The outlet, which says they covered the Florida wedding, quotes Anderson of saying about her groom, “I feel like Cinderella. I married Prince Charming.” As you know, the relationship soured and the pair was divorced by 1994. The magazine says the “Without Warning” star told them in 2015 that marrying Reynolds was “a really dumb move.”

Reynolds, who died at 82 in 2018, was Anderson's third husband. Her first wedding was to Bruce Hasselberg, who is a real estate developer according to Property Costa Rica. The pair divorced two years after their 1964 nuptials.

Beginning in 1974, Anderson had a 7-year marriage to “Airport '77” star Ross Bickell. In 2008, the actress married Bob Flick, with whom she remained until his death at 84. 

ABC7 Los Angeles says Anderson is survived by her two children. Her daughter Deidra, whom she shared with Hasselberg, is married to her son-in-law, Charlie Hoffman. She shared her son, Quinton, with Reynolds. Anderson's grandchildren and step-grandchildren include McKenzie and Megan Hoffman, and Felix and Maximilian Flick. 

In a 2003 interview, Anderson discussed her family on an Ellen Show appearance. “I'm a grandmother. I have two granddaughters, 10 and 7,” she said at the time. She also called son Quinton, 15 at the time, “very independent,” saying it was a good time for her to go back to work. The beauty shared a humorous anecdote of a time her son scolded her for embarrassing him by taking hold of his arm in front of “hundreds of people.” She said the teenager indignantly exclaimed, “You touched me!”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Lisa Rinna Reveals the True Story Behind Her Famous Lips","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/lisa-rinna-lips-cosmetic-surgery-reveal/","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 14:53:45 GMT","

“The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” alum Lisa Rinna is opening up about the cosmetic procedure she had decades ago that gave her those iconic lips. 

During an episode of her podcast with husband Harry Hamlin, “Let's Not Talk About the Husband,” Rinna told listeners the story of how her famous pout came to be. Rinna reminded Hamlin that she'd written about her lips in her 2009 book “Rinnavation: Getting Your Best Life Ever,” and gave some interesting details. 

Rinna shared that she and a friend were inspired to get their lips done after after seeing an actor in the movie “Beaches.” “Barbara Hershey put collagen in her top lip, we thought it was the coolest thing ever,” she said. 

A post shared by L I S A  R I N N A (@lisarinna)

Rinna said she was 24 years old at the time and revealed that her friend had a doctor who would do the collagen injections. But they were curious about other options. “We thought, ‘well, that's so cool, but wouldn't it be better if you could have something that lasted forever?'” Rinna recalled. 

She continued, “So what did we do? We found somebody who would shoot freaking silicone in our lips that would last forever.” But it wasn't a one and done procedure, Rinna explained. “We had to go four times and have tiny little bits at a time. … We held each other's hands and did it.”

The reason Rinna felt compelled to tell the story of her lips was due to the fact that other celebs have recently come out and spoken freely about their own cosmetic procedures. She praised a fellow reality star for opening up about a recent surgery. “Kris Jenner came out, which I thought was very cool, and said who had just done her facelift because it's phenomenal,” Rinna said.

Rinna lip injections later began to deteriorate and become a source of regular criticism, and she had a reduction and reconstruction surgery in 2010, she told People at the time.

“I don't regret it for a second. It's made me who I am,” she told the outlet about her original lip injections, but added, “I am the perfect poster child for what not to do on a whim.”

While in conversation with her husband, Rinna seemed to decide on the spot to open about the breast implants she'd gotten as well. She revealed that she had gotten saline implants after her daughters Delilah Belle and Amelia Gray were born. 

“They were down to my knees,” Rinna said about her breasts after giving birth. “I wanted to get my mojo back.” But the saline implants were too big for Rinna's liking, and she said they were often painful as well.

“So, I had those boobs for 10 years,” she shared, eventually opting for another procedure to have them replaced with silicone implants. “I had the smallest ones put in … 180s,” Rinna disclosed. 

For his part, Hamlin didn't seem to mind either way. “You said, ‘I'm not a boob man and I don't care' which was lovely,” Rinna reminded her husband.

James Van Der Beek made a heartbreaking health confession in November 2024, when he informed fans of his Stage 3 colorectal cancer diagnosis. He has continued to update fans on his life and the impact that his health has had, including how it has affected his children.

A post shared by James Van Der Beek (@vanderjames)

Van Der Beek is married to Kimberly Van Der Beek, and together they have six children: Olivia, Joshua, Annabel, Emilia, Gwendolyn, and Jeremiah. Their children range in age from 14 years old to two years old.

The “Dawson's Creek” actor revealed in an interview on “Today” on Wednesday, July 30, that his kids know about his cancer. He also revealed why he decided to tell them.

“I'm far from an expert, but our approach was just to be as honest as possible, as honest to the degree of their understanding, right? Because they know,” he said. He also admitted that his kids “can sense that Dad's having a tough day.”

Van Der Beek commented on how children pick up on things, like when something is wrong or their loved ones are hurting. “They know if Dad's in pain. They know, and so by not telling them, I think you're confusing them even more,” he said. “When you tell them what you're doing, and you tell them the approach, they can see it and they can feel it, and I think it's also your journey is their journey.”

He continued, “I have kids making me tea. ‘Dad, what do you need?' There's been a lot of beauty that's come out of it.” Van Der Beek also shared why he has been so vocal about cancer and his hopes to bring awareness. “But I would love to save everybody this journey, which is why I'm saying get screened,” he said.

A post shared by James Van Der Beek (@vanderjames)

Van Der Beek is open with fans about all aspects of his life, the good and the bad.

He competed on Season 28 of “Dancing with the Stars” alongside professional dancer Emma Slater, and his time on the show is still remembered fondly by fans. Slater has also discussed how the dance competition had a positive impact on Van Der Beek's life, helping him process his wife's miscarriage.

“He needed the show,” she told People in November 2019. “He said to me, ‘I need the show. I'm grateful to have an outlet and to have a form of physical expression, and keep that engine to keep me going. I need to feel normal and not fall into the pit.'”

The pair appears to have remained close. When Van Der Beek announced his cancer diagnosis, Slater showed her support publicly by commenting on his Instagram post.

Among the colleagues and fans remembering Hollywood legend Loni Anderson upon the news of her death on August 3, 2025, frequent Hallmark director Christie Will Wolf wrote a touching tribute about working with the former “WKRP in Cincinnati” actress on her last project. 

Wolf directed the 2023 Lifetime movie “Ladies of the 80s: A Divas Christmas,” starring Anderson, Linda Gray, Donna Mills, Morgan Fairchild, and Nicollette Sheridan. Looking back on their time together in a lengthy Instagram post, Wolf marveled at Anderson's “brains, beauty and wit” and called her a “courageous” woman. 

Anderson's publicist told the Associated Press that the Emmy died at age 79 in a Los Angeles hospital, following a long illness. 

Wolf, who has been directing Hallmark movies for the last decade including 2024's “Believe in Christmas” and another holiday film slated for 2025, shared a collage of photos with Anderson from filming the “Ladies of the 80s” movie two years ago. 

She captioned her post, “Rest in peace, beautiful Loni 🤍. A legend. The OG leading lady of TV—most immortal as WKRP in Cincinnati's Jennifer Marlowe, a perfect blend of brains, beauty, and wit.”

“I had the privilege of directing Loni in Ladies of the '80s,” she continued, “where Loni shone as Lily Marlowe. She wasn't just hilarious—she was courageous. She brought that role to life with grace, grit, and uncompromising heart.” 

Wolf wrote, “Loni was always kind, always real, and naturally magnetic. As a director, I learned so much from her; as a friend, I found both joy and support (as a #femaledirector w/ my kids back home while we filmed). Her fierce, funny, and brave spirit was as radiant inside as she was out.” 

“To her beautiful family,” Wolf added, “sending you my love and heartfelt condolences. The heavens will hold her tight – a star is now among them ✨🤍” 

A post shared by morgan fairchild (@morganfairchild1)

Fairchild, who co-starred with Anderson in the “Ladies of the 80s” holiday movie, also paid tribute “to memories of lovely Loni Anderson” on Instagram, sharing a photo of them on-set. 

The former primetime soap star, who also starred in the 2009 Hallmark movie “Perfect on Paper,” wrote that Anderson was “one of the genuinely nicest ladies I've ever worked with, on set of our recent Christmas movie with @thedonnamills. We had so much fun on this! She will be greatly missed!”

Chris Stuckmann's crowd-funded “Shelby Oaks” is gearing up for its big theatrical release on October 3 — and Neon's got a lot riding on the supernatural mystery delivering its first major Halloween play at the box office. 

Earlier this summer, IndieWire reported that the YouTuber's supernatural mystery — about a team of ghost hunters who lose one of their own — had undergone significant reshoots. In March, “Shelby Oaks” spent roughly $1 million to head back to Ohio to add scenes with “more blood and gore.”

 










When I reviewed the first cut of “Shelby Oaks” last summer at Fantasia Fest, I knocked it for Stuckmann's poorly written final girl (Camille Sullivan) and suspense with nonsensical execution. (Once again, I ask, why would you look for clues in an abandoned prison in the middle of the night when no clock is ticking? She's been missing for years!) Still, I gave it a “B-” because I admired how Stuckmann paid for it, and his love for the genre was obvious.

Additional scenes aren't likely to fix a bad script, but there's something to be said for pumping in set-pieces that shift the focus away from what a first-time director lacks — and toward the promise of what he can do when a studio finances his confidence. Producer Aaron Koontz walked IndieWire through the positives and negatives of pedaling a film paid for by the internet in our extended conversation from June.

Last week, Neon dropped several cryptic “Shelby Oaks” posters showing missing girl Riley (Sarah Durn) in… I don't know, black and white? Let's hope there's more coming from the “Longlegs” marketing team to support the idea that Stuckmann is an event-worthy filmmaker. Between “Talk to Me” and “Bring Her Back,” A24 has done well enough with YouTubers Danny and Michael Philippou — but internet creators continue to face stigma in Hollywood. Plenty of digital era defenders (me included!) want to see Stuckmann succeed, but the first version of “Shelby Oaks” I saw earnestly needed more money and time.

In July, Stuckmann appeared at San Diego Comic-Con to tease the film and underscore the idea that “movies saved my life.” Known first as a popular critic, the filmmaker drew criticism online several years ago when he said he would no longer give negative feedback to fellow directors. This stance has aligned Stuckmann with the capitalism of the studio system and widely shielded him from the harshest responses to his work in Hollywood, where he continues to align with horror acolytes.

[Editor's note: The following interviews contain spoilers for “The Naked Gun.”]

It's a scene that comes out of nowhere, and the one people want to talk about after seeing the new “Naked Gun” movie. At the mid-way point in the film, Frank Drebin Jr. (Liam Neeson) and Beth (Pamela Anderson) have fallen in love, setting into motion an ‘80s-style montage following the new couple on a lover's getaway to a winter cabin. 

At the isolated cabin, a book of spells brings Frank and Beth's cheerfully-made snowman to life. At first, the snowman is part of the couple's silly, intimate games, but eventually becomes a third wheel, resulting in homicidal rage and the love montage descending into something more akin to a horror movie.

The snowman is so off-the-wall, brazen, and hysterical — the perfect mix of “The Naked Gun” and the Lonely Island style of humor — and it is also the best example of how co-writer/director Akiva Schaffer put his own distinct stamp on the franchise. 

 










When Schaffer was on the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast, he discussed the snowman scene and how wary he was of doing “fan fiction” of the original. “No offense to other reboots and redos and legacy sequels out there, but a lot of them are so stuck on re-doing the stuff that the original did,'” said Schaffer. “You watch them and are delighted, but it's like empty calories, and when it's done, you barely remember that you saw it because, my theory at least, is they're not really a new movie.  They're fan fiction of the old movie.”

That fear of doing a “paint by numbers Mad Libs” of the original was very much on Schaffer's mind when he and co-writers Dan Gregor and Doug Mand reached the mid-point of their story. “We got to the point in our script, we were like, ‘Wow, this love story deserves a montage,'” said Schaffer. “The original ‘Naked Gun' has a very famous, very good montage set to ‘I'm Into Something Good.'”

The 1988 original love montage is truly a classic — the cheery Herman's Hermit 1964 hit is a smart fit, watching Leslie Nielsen and Priscilla Presley laugh their way through a first date to see “Platoon” is still funny, and who can forget that body condom? The original had done all of that so well, but so had others.

“We knew it had to be different than that,” said Schaffer. “And then also there's been 30 years of making fun of montages, whether it's ‘Team America' doing a montage, or whatever, there's not a lot of room left in the montage. We were debating not doing a montage and had a few other ideas.”

 










Schaffer said he was aware of “Jack Frost,” but had only seen the trailer of the 1998 killer snowman movie. It wasn't a sub-genre (if you can even call it that) he'd been consciously considering spoofing, but one night when he got up at four in the morning to use the bathroom, the snowman scene started to play out in his head.

“When I got back in bed, it had been percolating that day in the writers' room, and I just saw the entire thing and wrote it into bullet point notes, and then texted it to Dan and Doug,” said Schaeffer. “The next morning, I came into the writers' room and they were like, ‘Yeah. Done.' It honestly only changed teeny bits for production reasons, a cabin instead of a house, but it never really changed.”

That's not to say everyone involved with “The Naked Gun” reboot initially understood the brilliance of the scene. “It was polarizing in script-reads. People I really respect, like Andy Sandberg, when he read it for me, he was like, ‘Snowman's the best. Do not let them cut it,' knowing it would be cuttable,'” said Schaeffer. “It makes sense once you see the movie, but at one point I did have to threaten to quit.”

Schaffer is clear that he felt supported in making the film he wanted to make, but due to the opposition, he pared down the snowman so that if it didn't play, it could be removed from the film without leaving a hole. For example, there were drafts of the script in which the snowman reappears at the end of the film — able to reconstitute itself from the fountain after the climactic action scene — that never got shot.

 










“After the first test screen, it was the number one scene in the movie,” said Schaffer. “The people that really fought me on it after ate a lot of crow without me asking. I tried to let them off the hook easy, and go, ‘That's fine,' but they were like, ‘No, dude, we were wrong.'”

A Paramount Pictures release, “The Naked Gun” is now in theaters.

Before “Barbie” made box office history and earned him his fourth Oscar nomination, Noah Baumbach was still reeling from his last solo writing/directing effort.

Baumbach's 2022 Netflix film “White Noise” divided critics and failed to gain a strong audience upon release. The Don DeLillo source novel was famously understood to be nearly impossible to adapt to the screen. In a recent interview ahead of the Venice premiere of his next film, “Jay Kelly,” Baumbach now reflects on just how difficult the filmmaking process was when asked about the “divisive” response to the film.

 










“That was a really hard time for me. I'm very proud of that movie, but I had a really hard time making it,” Baumbach told Vanity Fair. “I had this feeling of, like, ‘Am I doing this just because I always wanted to do it — do I even like doing it anymore?'”

The writer/director added that he had a “quiet crisis,” leading him to wonder if he even would continue in Hollywood. Yet “White Noise” offered him a new source of inspiration: Baumbach befriended Emily Mortimer on set, as her children May and Sam Nivola (who would later star in “The White Lotus”) acted in “White Noise.” Mortimer and Baumbach went on to co-write “Jay Kelly,” Baumbach's first directorial effort since “White Noise.”

 










“I don't quite know why I asked her to write it with me,” Baumbach said of Mortimer. “But I liked myself with her. I liked how I felt inspired. She brought so much of herself to this, but I also felt that I was funnier and more charming and more profound than I might be without her.” 

As for the plot of “Jay Kelly,” Baumbach said, “It's about falling back in love with what you do, and falling back in love with yourself.” George Clooney stars as the title character, a veteran actor balancing fatherhood with fame. Baumbach reunites with his “Marriage Story” collaborator Laura Dern for the film, as well as Adam Sandler.

“Movie stars are our avatars. They are people that we invest in and project onto and live through,” Baumbach said. “And a movie star needed to play the movie star. That was in the DNA of what this thing should be: What if a movie star was essentially playing one, and reflecting back our own vulnerabilities and our own questions about life? What would that mean? I don't know that I knew exactly, but it seemed interesting.”

And all's well that ends well: It was also “White Noise” that led to “Barbie.”

“I wrote ‘White Noise,' and then, once I had that in a place where I thought, OK, I've done a lot of the heavy-lifting, Greta and I started work on ‘Barbie,'” Baumbach previously told Entertainment Weekly. “So that was all sort of happening during that first year of the pandemic. They're kind of connected in a funny. The execution is different but there are aspects of the world of ‘White Noise' that actually informed some of how we looked at ‘Barbie.'”

One of the best-reviewed films out of Cannes is ready for its August debut. 

From writer/director Spike Lee, “Highest 2 Lowest” has released its official theatrical trailer. The movie is the fifth collaboration between Lee and Oscar-winning star Denzel Washington. It is, as IndieWire's own David Ehrlich described it, a “jarringly upbeat” and “deliriously entertaining” homage to Akira Kurosawa's bleak 1963 classic “High and Low.”

A$AP Rocky — whose real name is Rakim Mayers — co-stars, thanks largely to Lee scrolling, as we all do, on Instagram. “What's funny is that I was looking at Instagram four or five years ago and people were saying that A$AP looked like he's Denzel's son,” Lee told Carmelo Anthony in April. “I seen those memes and then in the film we used that.”

Lee went on to praise Rocky — who also laid down a track teased in the trailer for the film — saying “A$AP, man, he fire… I mean, there's some scenes where him and D head to head – he ain't backing up. Like, ‘I'm here too.' So very, very happy with the way the film turned out and looking forward to sharing it with the world.”

 










Ehrlich agreed in his review, writing that Rocky was “just as good here as he is in recent Sundance highlight ‘If I Had Legs I'd Kick You.'” Ehrlich also detailed the plot, writing that the “protagonist is forced into a compromising position on the eve of a critical business deal when a downtrodden kidnapper mistakes his driver's son for his own kid, Trey (Aubrey Joseph). And once again [as in ‘High and Low'], all the money in the world can't save him from paying a price for his greed.”

“Highest 2 Lowest” already has big name fans, too, including director Martin Scorsese, who Lee related through an Instagram post heaped high praise on the film. Actually, he wrote that Scorsese “gushed” about virtually every aspect of the movie, including Washington's performance, the editing, cinematography, and, of course, Lee's direction. “Marty Was So Happy For Me,” Lee said.

“Highest 2 Lowest” is the first Lee joint since 2020's “Da 5 Bloods,” which was distributed by Netflix during the pandemic. His previous film, “BlackKkKlansman,” brought Lee a long-awaited Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

“Highest 2 Lowest” hits theaters everywhere on August 22 before streaming on Apple TV+ September 5. Watch the trailer below.

Following Congress passing a rescission order to claw back $1.1 billion previously allocated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting on July 18, the CPB has announced it is effectively shutting down. It'll eliminate most of its jobs by the end of September, with a small transition team kept in place until the end of January 2026 to wrap up final operations.

Make no mistake, though: This is not the end for public media. It's a grim moment, because it represents that PBS and NPR will go very underfunded in the time ahead, and viewers and listeners will notice differences in the programs and services available to them. But at the end of the day, the CPB was just the funding mechanism for PBS and NPR, the local stations that have been savvy at finding diversified revenue models over the years. There will be winners and losers with the CPB going away, and the effects of its dissolution will be unevenly applied, but this is not the end of an era. Even though it may seem like one, given that you've heard “and with support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting” your whole life.

IndieWire spoke to two prominent media commentators, both of whom are part of organizations that have received funding from the CPB: Eric Deggans, NPR TV Critic, and Sitara Nieves, Vice President of Teaching and Organizational Strategy at journalism nonprofit the Poynter Institute. Poynter has received money from the CPB to work with local public television and radio stations around the country (about 100 stations over the past year) to advise them on how they can improve their digital strategies as well as spur audience and revenue growth.

Both of them underscore the seriousness of the moment but insist there is a path ahead.

For the national PBS organization that oversees a nationwide brand strategy for public television, only about 14% of its actual revenue comes from the CPB. Most of the CPB's money goes to local PBS and NPR stations — for PBS, 172 such local stations exist, all independently owned and operated so as to have nonprofit status. Each station then pays a fee into the PBS national organization to have the rights to broadcast programs produced by other PBS stations. (NPR operates on a similar model.) 

“Masterpiece,” formerly “Masterpiece Theater,” is a local production of the Boston station WGBH that's then carried by all the other PBS stations that have paid the fee. Ken Burns is usually associated with Washington D.C.'s WETA. “Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood” was always produced by Pittsburgh's WQED.

“And now WQED just announced a layoff of 35% of its staff due to the cuts,” Deggans said. “These are all stations that were already operating on pretty tight budgets anyway. It wasn't as if people were drowning in luxury in the public media system. We were already having to do a lot with a little. And now, even that little bit has been taken away by the federal government. And the unfortunate reality is that the smaller stations are the ones that are losing the bigger pieces of their budget.” 

 










Deggans recommends that everyone who cares about these cuts visit AdoptAStation.org, which allows you to see how much of a station's overall funding is being depleted by the rescission order. A lot of bigger cities' stations are having around 10-15% of their overall funding go away with the collapse of the CPB, but stations that serve smaller, more remote, and rural communities will be affected the most. A number of NPR stations in rural Alaska are having more than 60% of their funding cut off because of the rescission order, with a couple locations losing 97% of their funding.

“We talk about news deserts, information deserts, often in rural parts of the country,” Nieves said. “There's going to be some real loss. I do think the CPB's closure is a big blow to the local and independent journalism that's been the kind of lifeblood and promise of public media since the creation of the system almost 60 years ago. It's also going to be that more local stations will find it difficult to buy the rights to air others' public media programming on their stations, for broadcast, and to stream on digital apps and their websites. This will almost certainly have an effect on what viewers end up seeing.”

One of the things the CPB helped fund is ITVS, a non-profit that commissions the kind of challenging, issue-oriented documentaries that wouldn't find a home in theaters or on streaming services. ITVS distributed $9 million in funding from the CPB annually to filmmakers, as its president Carrie Lozano wrote in The Hollywood Reporter yesterday. “The Mole Agent,” “Minding the Gap,” “I Am Not Your Negro” are all docs that received this funding. ITVS also produces the series “Independent Lens” on PBS.

 










“What I'm expecting to see is documentary filmmakers, particularly those who are making films about contentious subjects or subjects that might seem to have limited appeal, they're going to have a much harder time getting those films made,” Deggans said. “Right now if you're pitching a documentary that isn't about celebrity, true crime, or sports, it's much harder to get a sale.”

“I think on the local level, local public television stations have always produced their own films, and often commission their own documentaries that are relevant to their local audience,” Nieves said. “It's very likely those will be affected.”

Some corporate sponsors, including American Airlines, are listed as presenting some shows on PBS. “But PBS has very strict guidelines on the kind of underwriting they can take,” Nieves said. “It's publicly available on their website, they do have very strict guidelines on the impact that sponsors can have on programs that are different from the commercial space. So you'll never see Ken Burns holding a Coca-Cola, for example.”

PBS and NPR stations have to be independently owned and operated. “That means they're not going to get bought up by venture capitalist firms and get kind of chewed up and spit out in the way that we've seen happen to local newspapers,” Nieves said. “The CPB closing isn't the end of an era for public media, but that was an end of an era for local newspapers for sure. End of big eras all around.”

 










“Public media outlets have always tried to be very judicious about their economics and try to position themselves so that they don't rely so much on federal funding or funding from legislators,” said Deggans. Their operating margins are slim. But donors are a huge part of the funding model for stations, especially larger ones that serve larger cities.

That said, to be truly public media, and not just kept afloat by a donor class, government funding is important.

“Funding from the federal government helps reinforce the idea that this is media for all and that we really do have to try our hardest to reflect the entire nation in what we do, not just reflect the people who are most likely to donate,” Deggans said. “That's what the money from government sources helps reinforce. That our constituency is everybody. Even if they don't donate, they do kind of donate through their taxes. And so we're trying to represent everyone, we're trying to cover everyone. We're trying to do a great job of reflecting the nation back to itself.”

“It's awfully hard to restore something that's been taken away by the federal government,” Deggans said. “But I think those of us who work in public media hope that once people realize how many things that they love in media come from public media and are things they're going to lose, then maybe there'll be some public pressure to at least get the federal government involved in funding public media again on some level.”

 










“I've been talking to a lot of the general managers and station staff, and there's a real commitment and kind of almost fierce focus on making sure that they're still able to deliver on the promise of public media with or without CPB,” Nieves said. “I do think that there's a lot of conversation happening around how to continue to serve local communities and keep going. And I think they will keep going. I think there's a real spirit of survival, and I'm actually really encouraged and feel hopeful about how I'm hearing stations talk about what's ahead.”

James L. Brooks is finally back directing, exactly 15 years after his last film. 

Brooks returns with “Ella McCay” after 2010's “How Do You Know.” The Academy Award-winning writer/director helms the original film, which stars Emma Mackey as a lawyer spanning years of her life. Jamie Lee Curtis plays her supportive aunt, while Woody Harrelson is Ella's (Mackey) wayward father, and Rebecca Hall is her late mother.

Jack Lowden, Kumail Nanjiani, Ayo Edebiri, Spike Fearn, Julie Kavner, Becky Ann Baker, Joey Brooks, and Albert Brooks also star. 

 










The logline for “Ella McCay” reads: “An idealistic young woman juggles her family and work life in a comedy about the people you love and how to survive them.” The film is also set in 2008.

Brooks told The Hollywood Reporter that he wanted “Ella McCay” to capture the excitement of politics in the early 2000s. “The film is set in 2008, before we had this enormous division,” he said. “There's a reason for that, and it's because it's not about that. The picture is about how to not make government service and political office something any sane person would flee from. In a movie like this, you've got to figure out what the heroism is, and chase that. What is it really that makes you a fine person? Is it a character that's worth supporting for an entire movie? That's what you aim for.” 

 










Brooks added that he cast Mackey as the lead after watching her “brilliant” performance in the series “Sex Education.”

“I was in an audition process for a long time. I went to London, and very late in the game she turned up, and that was it,” Brooks said. “In my mind, I pictured the kind of heroines that we had in the '50s and '60s, early Katharine Hepburn and Rosalind Russell. There's a certain kind of great movie star we used to have, and Emma has a lot of those same qualities.” 

He continued that Mackey's co-star Curtis has an “infectious” spirit and grounded the ensemble. “She brings a humanity, moment to moment. When the making of a picture can become snarky, Jamie is just a wall against that,” he said. “Also, it helps that she has the best hug in town.” 

“Ella McCay” is produced by Brooks, Richard Sakai, Julie Ansell, and Jennifer Brooks. 

20th Century Studios will premiere “Ella McCay” in theaters December 12. Check out the trailer below.

The first trailer for Spike Lee's new movie, Highest 2 Lowest, is here. A$AP Rocky stars alongside Denzel Washington, Jeffrey Wright, Ilfenesh Hadera, and Ice Spice in the crime movie, which arrives in theaters on August 15 and comes to Apple TV+ on September 5. Rocky also soundtracked the film. Watch the trailer below.

Highest 2 Lowest is a reinterpretation of the Akira Kurosawa classic High and Low. Lee's take involves a music-industry ransom plot that plays out on the streets of New York (and in an apartment modeled after Kurosawa's original). A teaser came out in May ahead of the film's recent premiere at Cannes. A24 and Apple Original Productions produced the movie, which is the feature debut from screenwriter Alan Fox.

The Armed are mad as hell, and they're not going to take it anymore. After a loosely connected three-album cycle exploring the outer limits of hardcore punk, extreme pop, and the idea of “authenticity,” the cultish, semi-anonymous Detroit collective's sixth album dispenses with high-concept experiments in favor of something more immediate. Built around a barrage of blast beats, dissonant guitars, and feral vocal outbursts, THE FUTURE IS HERE AND EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE DESTROYED is billed as a spasmodic response to dehumanization and disaster. And when it sticks to that first-thought philosophy, it's a thrilling success.

The appropriately pithy press release that accompanied the album's announcement situated it as an “unfiltered expression of Weltschmerz,” a German word for the depression that sets in when the world as it is, with all its suffering and misery, can't match our ideals. Ours is a planet of trash fires and overtourism, balanced on the precipice of mass destruction; we have round-the-clock access to livestreams of state-sanctioned mass murder, interrupted by marketing pablum and vacation selfies. “Cheap shit/Fake fame/Dead kids/New gains,” lead vocalist Tony Wolski screams on “A More Perfect Design.” Trying to metabolize that poison isn't human. It's better, the Armed propose, to snap. So the album begins with Wolski screeching the apocalypse—“FOOLS! LIARS! HEATHENS! TRAITORS! REPENT! BE SAVED! JUDGMENT IS COMING!”—and maintains that life-or-death energy for as long as possible.

In these moments, bloody-throated and wide-eyed, the Armed really do sound vital. This is unvarnished madness, a man waving his arms on the street corner and imploring Saturday-morning shoppers to see the light. “Kingbreaker” begins with a desert rock swagger but beefs up into a half-speed breakdown with Wolski wailing, feral and adrenal: “My only friends are fucking scum.../In the noise we are all just ghosts.” On the frantic “Gave Up,” things slow to a heavyweight pace again for him to howl “so hollowed out” while incongruously melodic background consolation (“But never alone”) is all but buried by the noise. These brutal breakdowns are perfectly distributed across the album, like enormous fluorescent signposts on a dimly lit road.

The trouble with state-of-the-union albums is that they often come off as didactic, and the Armed do clip the edges of that minefield occasionally. Looking around at a world full of straw men on “Broken Mirror,” guest vocalist Moe Kazra, from Prostitute, disdainfully lists them off one by one: “These Yacht Club Socialists/These Patriot Grifters/Patriot psalm and their cure-all elixirs/These Anti-Christ Christians sure look more like demons.” It has the tone of the KLF and the Bush-era archetypes of American Idiot, which leaves the song in the middle of nowhere. Still, building those caricatures into something more like characters produces some of the album's best moments. The detestable and judgmental antagonist of “Purity Drag”—“Nothing is my fault/I am divine”—is a worthy target, pushed to the point of absurdity with their delusions of divinity. “Local Millionaire,” a molten rock song that could almost garner radio play, has a similarly one-dimensonal and (intentionally) self-important narrator who could easily become tiresome, but the voice shifts at the last second, ending with a viciously articulated “go fuck yourself” that pushes the track away from mimicry and back toward satisfying, knee-jerk fury.

Still, these wide-net diagnoses are less effective than the Armed's explorations of personal grief inside the machine. The sped-up and shoegazey “Sharp Teeth” has all the emotional immediacy of those agonized madman moments, but the focus is fresh and Cara Drolshagen's voice is engrossingly vulnerable: “Can't you see I'm on the edge/Broken plans in tangled webs... I am in hell.” The post-punk revival verses on “I Steal What I Want” burst into octaved choruses that nod to the dimness of a life spent in a doom-scroll glow without drifting into eye-rolling obviousness: “Slow motion getaway/Lives in a bubble/Bruised up and faded grey/We all crack the same.”

Miserable though it all might seem, there's a stubborn hope inherent to THE FUTURE IS HERE AND EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE DESTROYED. Our expectations might be at odds with reality, but weltschmerz relies on the idea that, no matter how self-evident our pain and suffering might be, the mind keeps expecting better from the world outside. Depending on your outlook, that's either hopelessly romantic or inspiringly optimistic. Returning to the vicious scream one last time on “A More Perfect Design,” Wolski stares straight down the camera and buzzsaws through the fourth wall: “Don't let it make you go numb/Don't let it dull your compassion/Don't let them tell you you're wrong/Don't let them claim this is balance.” It's unpolished and unequivocal, delivered with such conviction that it interrupts the blind acceptance of misery for at least a few seconds. Given the scale of the devastation outside, that alone feels like a small miracle.

Correction: A previous version of this review identified Tony Wolski as the singer of “Broken Mirror.” Prostitute's Moe Kazra is the vocalist on that song.

In 2017, Rounak Maiti opened his debut, Bengali Cowboy, with a note of cautious optimism: “In time, this I know, they'll learn to love me.” Seven years and a few existential crises later, that optimism has all but disappeared. Brute Fact/Home Truth, his third full-length, is a self-eviscerating spiral of a record, formed out of trauma, self-doubt, and the sort of bruising truths that rattle around your head long after the lights have gone out. Rendered in dense, echo-washed soundscapes, this is an album about watching yourself fall apart, and finding some sort of grace in the unravelling.

Written and recorded “through periods of severe isolation, disillusionment, and burnout”—during which Maiti changed countries, cities, and jobs, and left his label—Brute Fact/Home Truth rarely opts for a linear narrative. Maiti's stream-of-consciousness lyrics are like disjointed fragments of conversation and memory plucked from the infinite scroll of a brain stuck in overdrive. As if that interior disarray bled into the music, this is also Maiti's most rangey record yet—a genre-agnostic bricolage of wall-of-sound guitars, bubbling synth-pop, bit-blasted percussion, and dreamy ambience.

What Maiti calls his “brute facts” and “home truths” are those foundational emotional patterns and personal failings that resist explanation, let alone resolution. He finds release in picking at these scabs, counting his emotional wounds with a perverse glee. “2x Playback Speed” drapes post-Britpop guitars over hangdog-loser lyricism (“You don't wanna be on my side/Disappointment's walking down the timeline”), delivered in a reverb-drenched croon that sounds like Julian Casablancas channeling Morrissey. “Phantom Vibration Syndrome” soundtracks the rituals of post-traumatic hypervigilance—“Check my phone/Leave the lights on/Breathe in and out”—with arena-sized emo rock, layering delay-heavy guitar leads over towering riffs and thunderous drums.

Any hope for redemption is quickly ushered offstage. “Healing, it isn't what it's made out to be/It kinda makes me freak,” he sings on the Shantanu Pandit collab “Self-Medicate,” a song about hedonism as a coping mechanism that sounds like something Car Seat Headrest might write after a weekend overdosing on '80s synth-pop. On “Learnt My Lesson,” a standout collaboration with singer-songwriter Karshni, country-fried folktronica provides the backdrop for candid reflections on creative disenfranchisement delivered in spectral harmony. As the track builds to a coda of arpeggiated synths and sandblasted drums, Maiti asks, “What now?” on repeat—so emotionally spent that misery starts to sound like release.

On “Blinding Light America,” Maiti looks outward for once, mapping his complicated relationship with the United States, the country where he was born and where he returned for his undergraduate studies. His voice sounds raw and sepulchral, channeling some of the same grief and rage that animated Anjimile's 2023 album The King. “All I wanna do is stay/All I wanna do is go,” he sings, caught between the promise of the American dream and a sense of alienation from its current reality.

Despite its focus on character flaws and emotional faultlines, Brute Fact/Home Truth rarely feels maudlin. For the most part, Maiti avoids the usual clichés of sadsack indie rock. He captures the late-night doom-loop churn with clinical precision and a knack for turning expressions of self-recrimination into singalong hooks. His self-loathing never crosses the line into self-pity; you sense he's being honest when, on the final track, he sings, “These words, they just feel stupid and I've had it with myself in the end.”

After all the elliptical lyricism and emotional breadcrumb trails, this unvarnished moment lands with brutal force—as if the task of documenting inner turmoil has finally wrung Maiti dry. Brute Fact/Home Truth's refusal to package that pain into something neat or redemptive is perhaps its biggest strength. Maiti knows that there's no clean escape, no aha moment when all his troubles resolve. Instead, there's just the thankless, never-ending work of coexisting with your worst instincts. “I'll fight a million battles to get over myself,” he sings on “Phantom Vibration Syndrome.” “It'll take its time. It'll take its toll on me.”

Zohran Mamdani pulled off an inspiring 12-point victory to become the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York. How did he do it? He campaigned relentlessly on lowering costs for families, helping him build a grassroots movement so strong that millions of dollars in attack ads couldn't touch him. On primary election night, Andrew Cuomo conceded. 


	The people picked Mamdani, but it turns out there are some billionaires and Wall Street CEOs who can't stand the idea of a mayor who wants them to pay their fair share to create a city that everyone can afford. So the billionaires are dumping millions and millions of dollars into the race, backing either of two deeply flawed candidates: Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams. Maybe we should be asking ourselves why these Wall Street executives are pouring in millions of dollars to stop Mamdani, the affordability candidate.


	Cuomo and Adams are tripping over themselves to haul in millions of campaign dollars from billionaire donors. Adams raised $1 million in a single night from donors with ties to big law firms, commercial brokerages, and big real estate developers who could lose their iron-fisted grip on New York in a Mamdani administration. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman held private auditions for his support, inviting Adams and Cuomo to back-to-back meetings to tap dance for the “hundreds of millions of dollars” he has said he will spend to keep Mamdani out of office.  

	











	In a democracy, billionaires should not be able to buy our elections and control our politicians. Elected officials should work for their constituents, not use their government offices to hand out favors to a well-connected few. Adams escaped prosecution on charges of bribery and fraud only after he sold out New York City in a sweetheart deal with the Trump administration. As governor, Cuomo handed control of the state Senate to Republicans in a sham backroom deal. He also vowed to clean up Albany with an anticorruption commission, but when that commission began investigating one of Cuomo's buddies, Cuomo shut down the entire panel.

	You don't have to look very hard to see just how out of touch with working people and the mainstream values of the Democratic Party Adams and Cuomo have become. Adams withdrew from the primary early on, and Cuomo felt so entitled to the nomination that he barely bothered to campaign. But they've both gotten the memo from their wealthy backers to step it up: Adams is attacking Mamdani nonstop, and Cuomo is trying — and failing — to carbon copy Mamdani's man-on-the-street videos.


	Mamdani has specific ideas for making New York more affordable, and he's willing to stand up to ultra-powerful special interests to turn these plans into reality. 


	Take the cost of housing. Mamdani has plans to build 200,000 new affordable units over the next 10 years, he intends to freeze the rent for units controlled by the city, and he is committed to cutting the red tape that drives up costs for home owners. Mamdani also has the courage to write plans — including rent control — that crack down on the city's worst landlords and push back against billionaire real estate moguls. It's no surprise then that this month, the CEO of a New York-based real-estate investment trust held a $2,000-a-ticket fundraiser for Adams to stop Mamdani.


	After housing, the biggest squeeze on New York families is the cost of child care. In the wealthiest city on Earth, access to affordable, high-quality child care and early education should be automatic. Mamdani's plan for no-cost child care would make child care a right, not a privilege reserved for the rich.

	Let's do one more. Mamdani has a bold, detailed plan for protecting consumers and cracking down on the companies that try to cheat them. As mayor he would work to ban hidden fees, crack down on scammers, and end secret corporate handouts. When working people are getting gouged by giant companies, Mamdani is on their side.


	Mamdani has charged ahead with plans to make New York more affordable, and he's showing how to pay for it by taxing the ultra-rich and giant corporations. That may not make him popular with the richest New Yorkers, but he's willing to let Adams and Cuomo suck up to those guys. Mamdani is fighting to make New York work for working people.

Margaret Qualley and Jack Antonoff‘s earliest dates included long walks around New York City in places like Washington Square Park and near Electric Lady Studios, where they first met during a rooftop party. But while their romance was locationally rooted in the city, the traditional approach they took to dating highlighted the actress' North Carolina upbringing.


	“Before we were together, at the beginning, I would always follow Southern girl etiquette,” Qualley told Cosmopolitan. Antonoff was the first to say “I love you” and often the first to initiate their conversations over text. “I'm very old-school about stuff like this. I would never put myself out there first. I never text twice,” she added. “I mean, now we're married and I can text him anything at any time. We're always having a conversation; he's like my human diary.”


	In past relationships, Qualley would attempt to contort herself into someone else's ideal partner. It often left her feeling “lonely because I wasn't with my person, and it's like I was seeking something,” a feeling that dissipated when she found her now-husband. “I spent so many years trying to be someone's perfect girl, and that girl changed over and over again,” she said. “But I can't lie to Jack. I can't be that for him—he'd see through it. So I just have to be myself … Jack makes me feel safe and comfortable.”

	Qualley describes falling in love with Antonoff as “the biggest feeling I've ever felt,” adding, “He's been the person I've pictured my whole life. And I'm not even saying that metaphorically. My first crush was Adam Sandler in Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy, and I've been looking for that essence my whole life. I'm like, ‘That's Jack.'”

	











	Qualley and Antonoff married on Long Beach Island in 2023, with Taylor Swift, Zoë Kravitz, Channing Tatum, Cara Delevingne, Lana Del Rey, and more in attendance. “It was just so much fun,” she said. “I've never had that many espresso martinis in my life.”

E
ven over the phone, you can feel Liam Neeson's gravitas. It doesn't matter that he's hopped on the line for a “Last Word” interview loosely centered around his remarkable comedic turn in The Naked Gun reboot. This is still a man who's played both Jedi master and Batman supervillain; starred in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List and reinvented himself as a late-career action star in Taken. So when Neeson responds to a simple, “How are you?” with a deadpan, “Worse,” it takes a moment to register that the celebrated actor is actually gunning for giggles.


The Naked Gun, which opened this past weekend, is one of the funniest big-studio comedies to hit theaters in years. And so many of its breathless, breakneck gags succeed because of the tension between our expectations of Neeson — which he leans into onscreen — and the goofy havoc he wreaks as Frank Drebin Jr. It's perfect casting, an implicit nod to the fact that the man who played the elder Frank Drebin in The Naked Gun films and their TV predecessor, Police Squad!, was another actor better known for his dramatic turns, Leslie Nielsen. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Speaking with Rolling Stone, Neeson discusses his dead-serious approach to comedy, the lessons he learned as an amateur boxer, the importance of punctuality, and much more.


What is the best advice you've ever gotten?Stay poised, an old professional actor told me once, right.


What do you wish someone had told you about acting when you were just getting started?That the highs would've been great, and the lows would have been very low.

	











What's the worst part of success?Someone once said, “It's terrible when people are talking about you, and it's even worse when they're not talking about you.”


Do you have any acting heroes?I'll go back to the old days, Forties, Fifties. I did very much like Spencer Tracy as a performer, because he was always so real. Without putting on false noses and strange accents and all this sort of shit — he was just always present and real.

How have you tried to embody that in your work?If the audience believes the words coming out of your mouth, that's good enough for me.


What are some of your favorite books? I love crime novels. Nordic noir. There's one guy who passed away a few years ago, Henning Mankell. Terrific Nordic writer. 


What music still moves you the most?Pink Floyd, Dire Straits, U2. I like Pink Floyd's The Wall very much. I did see it in concert in 1983, maybe in London. It was terrific.


You haven't done a lot of comedy. What intrigued you about starring in a Naked Gun reboot?I was approached by Seth MacFarlane to gauge my interest in this. And I did see the original productions, which I enjoyed — they were a good giggle. So, I said I was interested, and we left it at that. Then I got the script, and I thought it was funny, certainly a bunch of giggles.


You were hilarious as yourself in Ricky Gervais' series Life's Too Short. The conceit was that you wanted to get into comedy and were terrible at it. What do you remember about filming that?People thought it was improvised, but it was far from it. Every comma, semicolon was written by Ricky. You know, I was a bit nervous about doing it because I thought I'd be laughing all the time. But Ricky was the one that was laughing all the time. It gave me confidence.


What comedies are you a fan of?As a kid, I'd go to a lot of Saturday matinees, and I adored Laurel and Hardy, those late-1920s, 1930s, little 20-minute comedies they shot. Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. Then more modern day, Tropic Thunder, Ben Stiller's film, always makes me laugh. Will Ferrell movies. Mike Myers, Austin Powers. And Napoleon Dynamite I thought was terrific.

You grew up in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. I'm curious if comedy played an important role in your life during what was otherwise a very violent time?Certainly cinema was a big release, comedy or not. It was a turbulent time. And escape was very, very important. School sports — I was an amateur boxer as a kid.

	











I read that you had a try out for the Irish soccer team Bohemian F.C.I don't know where that story came from — it's totally not true! I have two left feet when it comes to soccer.


Is there anything from your experiences as a boxer that you've carried with you?Preparation, and keeping fairly physically fit for life, and certainly for playing leads in movies. Because the work's exacting, there are long days. It behooves you to be reasonably fit.


Like yourself, original Naked Gun star Leslie Nielsen came from a more dramatic background. How did your dramatic sensibilities inform your comedic ones? In the movie, I try and play every scene as serious as I can. Maybe a little heightened for certain things. I don't play for comedy — that's one rule I set for myself. Don't play the comedy. That hopefully will come across with your fellow actors. 


Have you seen the videos of him doing interviews with the fart machine?I did. I saw a couple.


Even those he manages to play pretty straight. Yeah, he keeps it straight, but it's sweet, innocent schoolboy humor. 


Comedy is all about timing, but so is action and fight choreography. Do you see any kind of connections between the two?I suppose there is. That's an interesting question. You rely on your director and your editor, of course, certainly with fight sequences. In The Naked Gun, I was surrounded by terrific actors and actresses, especially Pamela Anderson. She's outstanding in the film — she's sexy, funny, and just great to work with.

In Taken, you famously say, “What I do have are a very particular set of skills.” What particular skills have you acquired over your career? Certainly with acting, you're always questing. You know what I mean? I never feel I've done it. There's always stuff to learn, with different actors and actresses you're working with, as well as different directors. As I said earlier, I just try to be real. And show up on time. That's very important. I hear disturbing stories about actors and actresses who are very gifted, but show up on the set two, three, four hours late. I would never work with those people. I think it's so insulting.


Punctuality is key.Yes, very, very important, I think. Because you have a crew of like 60, 70, 80 people waiting for you. The very least you can do is give them the respect by turning up on time.

	It's been two years since Chappell Roan dropped her debut LP, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, and she's kept her fans satiated since that time with the singles “Good Luck, Babe!,” “The Giver,” and “The Subway.” But in a new interview with Vogue, Roan revealed that her long-awaited second album isn't even close to ready.


	“The second project doesn't exist yet,” she said. “There is no album. There is no collection of songs…It took me five years to write the first one, and it's probably going to take at least five to write the next.”


	She understands that some fans are frustrated, but she needs them to understand that she has to work at her own pace. “I'm not that type of writer that can pump it out,” she said. “I don't think I make good music whenever I force myself to do anything. I see some comments sometimes, like, ‘She's everywhere except that damn studio.' Even if I was in the studio 12 hours a day, every single day, that does not mean that you would get an album any faster.”

	Roan didn't create videos for “Good Luck, Babe!” or “The Giver.” But for “The Subway,” she shot an elaborate one where she parties on a subway train, pursues an odd figure with green hair, and gets dragged around New York City in a series of long, tangled, Cousin Itt-like wigs. It's been viewed nearly 4.5 million times in just two days.


	“I didn't want it to be super serious,” she says. “It is a serious song, but at the same time it's not, because I say, ‘Fuck this city, I'm moving to Saskatchewan.' It's not that serious.”

	Roan fans frustrated by the potential long wait for her next album at least have numerous opportunities to see her live over the next few months. She's in the middle of an extensive run of European festivals right now, and she heads back to the United States in America where she'll play four nights at Forest Hills Stadium in New York City, two nights at Museum and Memorial Park in Kansas City, Missouri, and two nights at Brookside at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.


	“This pace is good right now,” Roan said. “This feels good and manageable. I feel like, for the first time in over a year, I can finally be excited about going to work and doing my job.”

	Democratic lawmakers in Texas are leaving the state in a last-ditch bid to prevent Republicans from further gerrymandering their congressional map at the request of President Donald Trump. If successful, the GOP's redistricting effort could potentially give the party an additional five seats in the 2026 midterms. 


	Facing the possibility of arrest under the orders of Republican Governor Greg Abbott, as well as steep financial penalties for their absence, 30 Texas Democrats have fled the state to Chicago, Illinois. Their absconding will deny the state legislature the necessary quorum needed to maintain a legislative session, a strategy they used (to no great effect) when Republicans aggressively gerrymandered the state's maps in 2021.


	“The choice was clear: Stand by while Abbott silences millions of Black and Latino voters, or use every tool available to stop this assault on our democracy. This corrupt special session is over,” Texas House Democrats wrote Sunday afternoon in a statement on X. 

	











	Meanwhile, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) threatened to forcibly return the lawmakers to the capitol. “Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately. We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law,” he wrote on X. State Republicans have rushed through what is supposed to be a once-in-a-decade redistricting process under the cover of a special session, with little time for public review. 

	











	With Trump and Republicans looking to maintain their majority in Congress through redistricting in Texas, Democrats have in turn begun considering redistricting efforts in Democratic-led states, such as California and Colorado, as a countermeasure. 


	Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin told News Nation on Sunday that “we're going to fight fire with fire. If Texas wants a showdown — which they clearly do — we're going to give them the showdown. And I talked with a number of Democratic governors around the country and they're already preparing to follow suit here.”

	Late last week, Donald Trump realized a dream that he's had since he was president of the United States the first time: firing the person who informed the world that his economy isn't as great as he wants to pretend it is.


	It was a move so comically autocratic that Recep Erdogan of Turkey already did it in 2022.


	According to former senior Trump administration officials, during his first term in office, the president would repeatedly complain to his aides that he should just fire the government officials who contradicted him by publicly promoting facts and data that were politically inconvenient to him. He was frequently paranoid about federal bureaucrats and other personnel trying to make him look bad. Things only got worse as the 2020 presidential election neared, when he and his White House embarked on frenzied cover-ups and propaganda campaigns, such as pressuring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to dial down the ballooning Covid-19 body count. 

	











	In the opening months of his second presidency, Trump still has a ton to cover up or to try to talk his way out of — and he's surrounded by a team of overzealous sycophants who want to assist him in propping up his authoritarian fantasies in ways that some of his first-term appointees squeamishly, if only occasionally, resisted.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In poll after poll in recent months, the American public has been screaming at the Trump administration that his policies have not improved, or have actually hurt, their day-to-day lives. The key issue that put Trump back in the White House — a brutal economy reflecting the aftershocks of the coronavirus pandemic, an end to aid programs, and the increasingly punishing state of American capitalism — is still putting many millions of Americans through hell. That economy now belongs to the sitting president, who keeps throttling it with his chaos-driven tariff regime. And the voters have noticed.

	











	According to a new survey from University of Massachusetts Amherst, Trump's poll numbers have fallen through the floor. The survey puts his approval rating at 38 percent, with 58 percent disapproving. Less than two thirds of respondents said Trump has handled inflation or tariffs well; 37 percent of people said he's handled jobs well, though that was before a weak jobs report. Trump's numbers with independents are exceptionally poor: 21 percent approval, with 17 percent saying he's handling inflation well.

	“With inflation remaining a persistent problem, a weakening job market, and tariffs causing economic upheaval in the stock market and corporate boardrooms, it is no surprise that majorities of Americans believe that President Trump has done a poor job in handling inflation, jobs, and tariffs since taking office for a second time,” says UMass Poll Director Tatishe Nteta. He adds that “time will tell whether his efforts to pass the buck will alter the public's perceptions of Trump's economic performance or if Americans will continue to believe that the buck stops with President Trump.”


	But in the same way that this president figured he could bomb and shit-post his way to peace in the Middle East, Trump still thinks that he can spin the media and purge his government all the way to declaring economic victory, no matter what the economic data and Americans say. 


	On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the job market is stagnating, showing weak numbers for July as it revised down previous job growth estimates for May and June.  


	Asked on Friday to comment, albeit anonymously, on the just-released jobs report, one senior Trump administration official simply replied to Rolling Stone: “Shitty.” They declined to elaborate further.

	To several of the president's advisers, the problem with the jobs report was that it showed the economy is not exactly “HOT,” as Trump often claims to the American people. Trump saw it differently. He lashed out, claiming that “today's Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad,” and publicly announced the firing of Erika McEntarfer, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics.


	Prior to the president's outburst online, Vice President, J.D. Vance was citing the BLS data as evidence of Trump's economic splendor.


	By that point, Trump administration officials and communications hands across the federal government had been working on press releases and talking points for their principals to try to spin the latest jobs report data to make it sound like things are still on the right track — and that Trumponomics is working. 

	











	As soon as Trump posted his social-media rant announcing the sacking of the BLS official, those drafts were immediately junked, or at least seriously revised to incorporate the president's baseless “rigged” claims, two administration appointees say.


	In the hours before Trump announced McEntarfer's firing, Stephen Moore, an informal economic adviser to Trump, was blunt, telling Rolling Stone that when it came to “the lousy jobs numbers, a lot of that are residual effects of the tariffs. Everybody was very uncertain about how this was all headed, and those tariffs caused a lot of havoc.”


	Moore says that while he's “still pretty bullish going forward” due to the president and the GOP getting “the tax bill done” and the recent “series of trade deals,” the Trump ally says that “I think now would be a good time to stop talking about new tariffs.”


	“Sometimes Trump can't stand prosperity,” he adds. “Whenever things start to go really well like with the stock market, he announces another round of tariffs like he did yesterday… My advice to Trump is to stop with the tariffs. We don't need tariffs right now… When I see him, he knows my position; every time he sees me, he says: ‘There's Steve Moore! He doesn't like tariffs!' This will hopefully get the administration to back off of the tariffs.”


	But if this past week is any indication, Trump isn't done causing economic chaos. Instead, Trump and his government are going to prioritize suppressing bad news and uncomfortable economic data.


	“BLS Has Lengthy History of Inaccuracies, Incompetence,” the Trump White House insisted on Friday evening, in an email blast to the media. “A lengthy history of inaccuracies and incompetence by Erika McEntarfer, the former Biden-appointed Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has completely eroded public trust in the government agency charged with disseminating key data used by policymakers and businesses to make consequential decisions.”

	“You're right,” Trump said. “Why should anybody trust numbers?”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q='unidentified+flying+objects'","The small village in Scotland that is the UK's UFO capital with hundreds of sightings","https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/scotland-now/small-village-scotland-uks-ufo-35669098","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 09:33:00 GMT","

More than 30 years after the first reports emerged, the mystery surrounding a small village in central Scotland remains as baffling as ever.

Bonnybridge, near Falkirk, shot to global attention in the 1990s after a wave of sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), or what are now officially referred to as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs).

Since then, more than 300 reports of unexplained activity have been recorded, making it one of the UK's most active areas for supposed other-worldly encounters.

The area around Bonnybridge, Falkirk, and West Lothian became known as the Falkirk Triangle, a term coined after growing interest in the phenomenon.

At its height, the story drew international media coverage, sparking theories of conspiracies, government cover-ups and even the possibility of a portal to another dimension.

One of the earliest and most significant sightings occurred in January 1992. Local businessman James Walker was driving along a country road towards Droves Loan when he claimed to see something he could not explain.

Malcolm Robinson, one of the UK's leading UFO and paranormal researchers, recalled: “He claimed that he saw a large triangular-shaped craft low down in the sky, which had small lights on its underside. It was not a conventional aircraft.”

Robinson has spent 45 years investigating strange phenomena. He founded Strange Phenomena Investigations in 1979, Scotland's longest-running UFO research group, and has written extensively on unexplained sightings. Over the years, he has examined hundreds of reports, both in the UK and abroad.

At the time of the Bonnybridge sightings, local councillor Billy Buchanan took it upon himself to gather accounts from residents. By the end of 1992, he had documented over 200 separate incidents involving unusual lights, shapes and aerial objects.

Reports varied widely. In one case, a driver described a formation of lights in a cross shape hovering above a road before changing into a triangle. In another, a family claimed to have seen a bright circle of light land in a nearby field.

Despite repeated attempts by Buchanan to raise the issue at the highest levels of government, his calls for an official investigation were consistently ignored. He wrote to several ministers and even Prime Ministers, including Tony Blair in 1997, but received no formal response.

“It is important to say that the term UFO means Unidentified Flying Object. It does not describe alien ships visiting the earth,” Robinson added.

The growing number of reports soon drew widespread media attention. Local and national newspapers were quick to seize on the story, and television crews descended on the village.

A public meeting was held in January 1993, as concerned locals sought answers. That November, broadcasters filmed a UFO watch event in Bonnybridge. Despite the freezing conditions and a lack of sightings, the interest only grew.

By the mid-1990s, sightings from the area had featured in countless newspaper articles and were even explored on national television. In 1997, Bonnybridge was the subject of the primetime show Strange But True.

However, as the years went on, the wave of sightings gave way to scepticism, with critics accusing witnesses of seeking publicity or fabricating stories. Some national tabloids even ran claims of alien contact with villagers.

Still, for many residents and researchers, the questions remain unanswered.

Whether the events of the 1990s were the result of mass imagination, military activity or something more mysterious, the truth behind the Falkirk Triangle continues to be hotly debated. And for some, it remains a mystery worth revisiting.

Rupert Matthews has written books about ghost sightings, cryptozoology and other paranormal subjects

Reform UK has been mocked after announcing their latest defection to the party – a police and crime commissioner who is an expert on ghosts, aliens and UFOs. 

Rupert Matthews, who holds the post in Leicestershire and Rutland, was introduced on Monday as having joined the party from the Conservatives, breaking a 40-year membership.

Before being elected in 2021, he served two years as a European parliament member for the Tories. He has also written a number of books about ghost sightings, UFOs, cryptozoology and other paranormal subjects.

Cryptozoology is a pseudoscience focusing on legendary animals, such as the Sasquatch, in order to evaluate the possibility of their existence. 

Responding to the announcement, the prime minister's press secretary said: “Their big defection is very interested in the fantastical and the unexplained. It's no surprise he's added Reform's fiscal plans to that list.”

Meanwhile, a Labour source said: “It's not just the ghost of Tory past that is swelling the Reform ranks. Their latest recruit Rupert Matthews peddles alien conspiracy theories and believes the removal of abortion rights overseas is a ‘triumph' for democracy.”

During a press conference at the party's London HQ on Monday, unveiling the move, Mr Matthews took aim at the criminal justice system, saying the “dark heart of wokeness” needed to be removed, as well as accusing politicians in Britain of taking inspiration from “failed states” for their policies.

“It's almost as if they've looked at countries like Lebanon and Libya, the policies that have led to them becoming failed states and thought, ‘that looks good, let's try that here in Britain'”, he said. 

“The self-serving, self-entitled liberal elite who have let our country down time after time after time are now on notice. Their day is almost done. Be they Conservative or Labour governments, everyone knows our politicians have failed us all.

“They have let this country down. They have let the British people down. Enough. Now is the time for Reform.”

He also said police officers were all too often working with “one hand tied behind their back”.

“I daily face a fight against crime. I see ordinary, hard-working people burgled, robbed and mugged. Shoplifting is getting out of control. Antisocial behaviour is turning too many of our town centres into an apocalyptic wasteland of lawless Britain.”

Reform also announced that a retired prison governor of Wormwood Scrubs, Vanessa Frake-Harris, had joined the party and would be contributing to its law and order task force. 

Ms Frake-Harris, who joined the prison service in 1986, detailed increases in escapes, attacks on prison officers and increases of drugs, weapons and mobile phone finds in the last year.

She said: “Successive governments, Conservative and Labour, have driven the prison service to its knees through lack of investment, support and an unwillingness to allow people who know what they are doing to get the job done.”

She continued: “Our prisons are in a crisis caused by Labour and the Conservatives. What have their solutions been? They have let 10,000 prisoners out of jail early. To let criminals out of jail before they even serve their full sentence is a disgrace.”

A Labour spokesperson said: “It's farcical that Farage can't say what his policies are, how much they would cost, or how they would even work. Reform aren't serious and don't have a clue as to how they would address the challenges facing working people.”

Reform UK has been contacted for comment.

A terrifying warning from Stephen Hawking has resurfaced after Harvard researchers published a paper speculating that a comet could be a 'potentially hostile' alien object.

Last month, Harvard University researchers Avi Loeb, Adam Hibberd and Adam Crowl published a paper which suggested that comet 3l/ATLAS could be a reconnaissance probe sent by a technologically advanced alien civilisation watching our planet.

""The hypothesis in question is that [31/ATLAS] is a technological artefact, and furthermore has active intelligence. If this is the case, then two possibilities follow,"" the group wrote in the paper.

""First that its intentions are entirely benign and second they are malign."" The researchers added that in the event of an attack it'd 'require defensive measures to be undertaken'.

It's worth noting that the researchers, as well as NASA scientists, have since stressed the most likely scenario is that 3l/ATLAS is just a comet.

But should the 'most likely outcome' of 3l/ATLAS not being a 'completely natural interstellar' object turn out to be false, then late physicist Stephen Hawking has a sobering warning to remind us why we shouldn't rush to welcome alien arrivals to Earth.

Prior to his death in 2018, Hawking had stressed numerous times about the dangers of reaching out to more technologically advanced civilisations, as they may not have peaceful or benevolent intentions.

""If aliens ever visit us,"" Hawking explained in an episode of Into the Universe back in 2010, ""[Then] outcome might be similar to when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans.

""We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet,"" he continued.

The Cambridge researcher believed that an advanced alien civilisation capable of cruising through the cosmos would've likely have exhausted the materials on their own planet, and be on the lookout for other plants to colonise for resources or move to.

This wasn't the only time which Hawking warned against reaching out to alien civilisations, with the 76-year-old drawing a line between establishing that other planetary civilisations exist and offering an olive branch.

Hawking's warnings relate to a theory known as the 'Dark forest hypothesis'.

The 'Dark forest hypothesis' suggests that several alien civilisations are out there, however no one wants to be the first to put themselves forward due to fears or alerting even more advanced civilisations to their location.

Which means if aliens are out there and beginning to make themselves known, we shouldn't be welcoming them to Earth with open arms, unless we want to live out a War of the Worlds type scenario.

Beckie-Ann Galentine's guests knew to expect a 'weird' baby shower, but they didn't know how many paranormal twists she had planned

 A paranormal investigator and mom-to-be did her baby shower her way — and now its going viral.


 In a video posted to TikTok on July 9, Beckie-Ann Galentine documented what she called ""the spookiest baby shower ever,"" an event that included paranormal-themed activities and seances. The clip has since garnered millions of views as well as thousands of comments from viewers.


 A lover of all things spooky, Galentine knew she'd want to plan her own event catered to her particular tastes. ""I think people knew if I didn't do things my own way, it wasn't necessarily going to be what I wanted. So I planned it and what was really nice is a lot of people have already done stuff for the baby, as far as necessities,"" she tells PEOPLE about hosting the event.


 ""This got to be an open invitation for my community to come together and celebrate a new baby being brought into it, so it's obviously something that's very special,"" she continues.


 Admittedly, a paranormal theme isn't what comes to mind for most when it comes to a baby shower, but Galentine says the idea was very aligned with her lifestyle. ""My day-to-day life is very engulfed in the paranormal and everything, so I saw it — and not everyone saw it this way — but I saw it as a way to connect with ancestors and people who came before us,"" she explains.


 ""Bringing new life into this world is kind of like connecting you to all of the people who walk the same path before you for hundreds of years, so that's kind of where the theme came from. It was rooted in spirit communication and history,"" she continues.


 When it came to planning, Galentine had a vision for the perfect venue. ""I had known that I wanted a haunted venue because people are going to be traveling and there was already going to be a baby shower, so I wanted a place that people could stay afterwards, and we could all kind of enjoy each other afterwards,"" she says of choosing the Shanley Hotel in Napanoch, N.Y., where she and guests had the opportunity to ghost hunting after the party was through.


 She adds, ""I wanted to go through what we all love to do with, just investigate, and the venue is one I've been to a couple of times. Ultimately, we decided on that because some of the other hotels, they don't really have like space to explore, and this one has every floor with a different vibe and has something else going on.""


 After months of planning, Beckie was happy to report that the outcome made her ""so happy."" She says, ""When it was finally happening, I was so relieved, and it was like. How is this going to come together? How is this going to fall into place?""


 The event met her expectations and more. Activities included guessing how many candies were an ectoplasm jar, a trivia game about famous locations that are haunted by children and some on-sight ghost hunting as well as a scavenger hunt. ""I did kind of a cursed object scavenger hunt with human hair and antique dolls and seashells. There was a key for that, so all of the items were tagged an hidden,"" she says of the latter.


 Before the shower itself was over, guests enjoyed a beautiful custom cake from Vegan Treats in Bethlehem, Pa. ""One of the obvious show-stopping things from the event was the cake,"" she says, explaining that she told the dessert vendor she wanted ""something that kind of reminds me of a Ouija board [and] that I wanted to be in this muted lavender Victorian color that matches everything.""


 ""I had literally a pencil sketch of what the cake was going to look like, and everyone was just like shocked when that came out. The cake obviously grabbed a lot of attention,"" she continues.


 After the party, the group of 20 guests went down to the morgue in the basement of the hotel to beat the heat. ""I say morgue, but what it was used for is a receiving vault,"" she says of the space. ""So, during the winter, when the cemetery couldn't keep up with all the burials, especially years where there was like a local pandemic or something epidemic, they would store the bodies there for the winter. Then when the ground was thawed, they would enter them in the cemetery.""


 Galentine says, ""We saw that space and then we were able to do the Ouija seance, which someone had as a prize from one of the games. I collected antique talking boards and have a collection that's been featured on the news. I have probably a hundred of them in my house, so choosing them as the prize was kind of like a way of sharing something I love with the people who were there, because not a lot of people know where to find the antique Ouija boards.""

 She event kept the theme for her registry as she prepares for the arrival of her baby boy, who will be named Ezra. ""There's a lot more other people who paved the way for moms to have choices when it comes to clothes and toys, and things like that. [The baby] has tons of color and has things that are not in that aesthetic. My registry had a lot of things from those smaller brands, and it was really nice, too, because when I picked things on my registry, I was looking at small artists on Etsy and things that were hand designed and handmade,"" the expecting mom says.


 Galentine adds, ""A lot of people made things for him as well. You can always get more diapers. There's always going to be more baby products that you can buy at any store, but I like that I have things that in 20 years, I can say, 'Hey, this person made this for you to kind of welcome you here.' ""


 The unusual theme may have raised some eyebrows when Galentine shared it online, but she's grateful for every moment. ""It turned out because it was perfect that everyone got to participate in every facet of it,"" she says.

 ""The people I knew knew it was going to be weird. The invitation said, 'A shower and seance welcoming Ezra Oliver.' The people who wanted to be there understood that this was not going to be traditional, but I don't know if they expected it to be all that it was. I heard 'This was the best baby shower I've ever been to,' people were talking about it for days. It was really positive. ""


 In the end, Galentine was most grateful to see the outpouring of community she and baby Ezra are being met with. ""Having a baby brings out a side of community that I've never noticed before. I realized how much we look out for each other and how much space there is to do that,"" she shares.


 ""I thought maybe a few people would show up and that's it, and I was okay with that. When I saw the table and the bags wtih the little ghosts on them and all the handmade things, it was perfect. Nobody who was there is ever going to forget going to that baby shower, it's it, and they've said that,"" Galentine says. ""Even afterwards, I'm still seeing people who want to interact and support each other. So, it was like, you know, all the people who were there kind of bonded, and it created an even stronger moment.""

BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WNKY) — Bigfoot believers, ghost hunters, and cryptid enthusiasts gathered in Bowling Green on Saturday for the second annual Bigfoot MiniCon.

The event brought together paranormal fans from across the region, featuring panelists, investigators, and former television personalities sharing stories and theories about the unknown.

“This is the Bigfoot MiniCon, and it's a great opportunity to bring a bunch of people together that have a similar interest in strange and supernatural type… I guess sightings,” said Dave Schrader, host of the Paranormal 60 radio show. “Everything from aliens to spirits to Sasquatch.”

It marked Schrader's first time attending the event in Bowling Green. “I was drawn here because my friends, people from the shows Mountain Monsters and Expedition Bigfoot, really love this area,” he said. “Since I've been here, I can admit to that — everybody we've had a chance to meet have been absolutely fantastic and so welcoming.”

The Sons of Appalachia, formerly seen on the show Mountain Monsters, also appeared at the convention, promoting their new independently produced web series.

“Everybody here has been so wonderful. It's a great event. People have been very pleasant,” one of the team members said. “It's been a great turnout. This has just been fantastic.”

The group emphasized that even seasoned investigators come to events like this to learn something new. “Any time we get to be around other enthusiasts — if you're not learning, then you're not listening,” they said.

Organizers say they hope to bring the event back for a third year in 2026.

Before his death, Stephen Hawking consistently warned humanity against contacting aliens. As interest in UFOs and little green men comes to the fore, an ominous warning he made has also resurfaced. What did Stephen Hawking say about aliens? Is humanity in danger? All you need to know.

Stephen Hawking, the renowned physicist known for his contributions to humanity's understanding of black holes, the cosmos, and the nature of the universe, once warned that if aliens make contact with us, they won't be kind and might view Earth as just another planet to plunder. The world-renowned scientist's warning has once again entered the spotlight as intrigue around UFOs and extraterrestrial life continues to escalate. This is amplified by reports of a possible alien warship that may strike around November and as US Vice President JD Vance revealed his ""obsession"" with the little green men. ""I'm obsessed with the whole UFO thing. What's actually going on? What were those videos all about? What's actually happening?"" He said recently while appearing on the Ruthless podcast. What did Stephen Hawking say about aliens? Is humanity in danger? All you need to know.

Before his passing in 2018, Hawking was known to persistently caution against intentional efforts to communicate with aliens, especially those potentially far superior to humans. He warned that an intellectually superior species may view our planet as a world ready to plunder instead of approaching us with goodwill. In an ominous warning, he suggested that such contact may even jeopardise humanity's survival.

In a 2010 episode of 'Into the Universe', the genius famously said that, ""If aliens ever visit us, the outcome might be similar to when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans."" Pointing at how historically dominant societies, when they encounter less developed cultures, tend to dominate and disregard suffering that isn't their own, he argued that humans only need to look at themselves ""to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet"". According to Hawking, it would be stupid to presume that a sophisticated civilisation would inherently embrace peace.

Stephen Hawking further theorised that a developed alien species that possesses advanced interstellar travel capabilities would probably (like humans are currently doing) have depleted their natural resources. Thus, driving them to travel the cosmos to look for newer, resource-rich worlds. In such a case, Earth could look less like an ally and more like a viable conquest.

Notably, Hawking was not alone in warning about how dangerous contact with aliens could be. Carl Sagan, an American astronomer and planetary scientist who dedicated his life to research on his research on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, is also known to have voiced a need for caution. He pointed out that alien psychology could be beyond our predictions.

Staunchly shunning attempts to actively try to communicate with aliens, Stephen Hawking instead proposed passive monitoring was the way to go. However, some scientists argue that humanity has been beaming radio waves and signals into space for over a century. They posit that intelligent alien species may already know we exist, and if Hawking's warning was in fact a premonition, then we may already be doomed.","{'href': 'https://www.wionews.com', 'title': 'WION'}","other"

A new study reveals that cosmic rays could be the key to supporting alien life on icy moons like Europa and Enceladus.

Recent research has uncovered a surprising twist in the search for extraterrestrial life: cosmic rays, typically seen as hazardous to life, may actually support alien life on cold, dark moons in our solar system. A groundbreaking study published in the International Journal of Astrobiology presents new findings that challenge conventional thinking in astrobiology. The research suggests that high-energy cosmic radiation might be able to provide the energy necessary to support microbial life beneath the icy surfaces of moons such as Europa and Enceladus—places previously thought to be inhospitable to life.

Cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles from space, are well-known for their destructive properties. These rays, originating from supernovae and other cosmic phenomena, have enough energy to strip electrons from atoms and molecules, a process that can damage biological structures. On Earth, our atmosphere and magnetic field shield us from this radiation. However, the study suggests that on distant moons, cosmic rays might play a crucial role in supporting alien life.

The process that makes this possible is called radiolysis, where high-energy cosmic rays interact with water or ice molecules, breaking them apart and releasing energy. This energy could theoretically support microbial metabolism, enabling life to survive in environments devoid of sunlight and warmth. This new understanding opens up possibilities for life on moons that were once considered too harsh for survival.

Traditionally, scientists have focused the search for alien life on planets with Earth-like conditions, including liquid water and a moderate climate. However, this new study suggests that life could potentially thrive in cold, dark environments as long as there is subsurface water and a source of cosmic radiation. Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, is a prime candidate for this kind of alien habitat. Beneath its icy surface lies a vast ocean, and cosmic rays could provide the energy necessary for microbial life to flourish in this otherwise inhospitable environment.

Similarly, Enceladus, Saturn's moon, also has subsurface oceans, which could interact with cosmic rays to provide the conditions needed for alien life. These findings suggest that alien organisms could survive in places that were once considered too extreme for life to exist, vastly expanding the scope of where life might be found in our solar system and beyond.

“This discovery changes the way we think about where life might exist,” says Dimitra Atri, an astrobiologist at New York University's Abu Dhabi campus. Instead of focusing solely on warm planets bathed in sunlight, the study encourages the exploration of cold and dark worlds where subsurface water and cosmic radiation might create habitable conditions for life. Atri notes, “Life might be able to survive in more places than we ever imagined.”

By shifting the focus of astrobiology to include places like Europa and Enceladus, the study broadens the potential for discovering alien life in the universe. This new perspective on cosmic rays as a source of energy for microbial metabolism suggests that the possibilities for life beyond Earth are far more expansive than we once thought.

Mars, once considered a top candidate for harboring alien life, is also included in this study as a promising location. The presence of subsurface water and evidence of past liquid water on the surface make Mars an ideal candidate for microbial life. Cosmic rays interacting with underground ice could provide the energy necessary to sustain life, even in the absence of sunlight.

However, Europa and Enceladus stand out as the most likely places where alien life could thrive, according to the simulations conducted in the study. The subterranean oceans of these moons, shielded by thick ice crusts, may allow for the perfect conditions where cosmic rays can support microbial organisms. The discovery that alien life could exist on such moons pushes the boundaries of our search for life in space.

Just one day after winning the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship at SummerSlam, Alexa Bliss is already teasing a potential return to her dark, supernatural roots. In a new interview, she also hinted at a sinister plan for her new tag team partner, Charlotte Flair.

Bliss and Flair, the ""Allies of Convenience,"" captured the titles on Night One of SummerSlam, defeating Raquel Rodriguez and Roxanne Perez. Now, Bliss's comments suggest their championship reign could be headed down a very strange and twisted path.

Speaking to Sports Illustrated ahead of SummerSlam, Bliss was asked about revisiting the supernatural character she portrayed while aligned with ""The Fiend"" Bray Wyatt. She confirmed she is completely open to it.

""A hundred percent,"" Bliss said. ""One thing I've always said about my character is that it's always evolving.""

The most intriguing part of her comments came when she discussed her current partnership with Flair. She hinted that she may have found a replacement for her demonic doll, Lilly.

""Who knows, maybe Charlotte will become the next Lilly,"" Bliss stated.

This is an ominous comment given the history between the two superstars. It suggests that Bliss may be looking to corrupt her new partner and draw her into the darkness.

The original Lilly doll was a central part of Alexa Bliss's supernatural persona from 2020 to 2021. Bliss claimed the doll was the source of her power. Their bond came to a dramatic end at the Extreme Rules event in September 2021.

After defeating Bliss in a championship match, Charlotte Flair brutally and methodically ripped the Lilly doll to shreds in the middle of the ring, leaving a distraught Bliss wailing over the remains. This moment was the storyline reason for Bliss's character being ""reset"" and losing her supernatural abilities. Her new comment makes it clear she has not forgotten what Flair did, adding a deeply personal and sinister layer to their current tag team.

While Bliss is having ""a lot of fun tagging with Charlotte,"" her underlying motives are now in question. She also noted that a future interaction with the Wyatt Sicks will ""probably"" happen, keeping fans guessing about her ultimate allegiance.

The unassuming town of Carnation, Washington, is gearing up to host Modest Mouse‘s inaugural Psychic Salamander Festival this September 13 and 14. Home to just 2,279 people, the small town farm venue promises an intimate festival feel, a bit of an oxymoron when considering the usual music festival formula. 

Psychic Salamander Fest will take place four months before Modest Mouse and friends set sail on their Ice Cream Floats cruise tour. The cruise will set off on February 5, 2026 and return on February 9. Kurt Vile and The Violators, Mannequin Pussy, Built To Spill, Fidlar, and more will join Modest Mouse on the open ocean as the cruise sails from Miami, Florida, to Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic. 

In the meantime, the Psychic Salamander Fest lineup is looking like a nostalgic indie-rock dream. Hosted by Modest Mouse, of course, the lineup also includes The Flaming Lips and Built To Spill on Saturday, September 13. Additional acts include Courtney Barnett, The Vaudevillian, and Mattress. 

On Sunday, September 14, the lineup features Modest Mouse once more, this time performing the 2000 album The Moon & Antarctica in full. The Flaming Lips will also take the stage again, performing their 1999 album The Soft Bulletin. Additional artists include Sleater-Kinney and Yo La Tengo, along with Friko and Sun Atoms. 

A post shared by Modest Mouse (@modestmouse)

Psychic Salamander Festival will take place at Remlinger Farms in Carnation, Washington. Remlinger Farms is a working farm and amusement park in the small town, specializing in local produce, corn mazes, U-Pick fields, and other outdoor entertainment. 

The farm is listed in the Local Legacies Project archives of the Library of Congress, meaning it took part in the documentation of local traditions and practices during the library's 200th anniversary in 2000. Remlinger Farms has evolved since its inception in 1965, adding a market, theater, and a petting zoo, along with the Tolt River Railroad Steam Train Ride. 

According to the festival website, parking is free with a ticket purchase, while children under 12 can attend for free. Additionally, concert-goers can come and go as they please during the festival weekend with the relaxed re-entry policies. 

Tickets are available now on the official Psychic Salamander Festival website. Interested fans can also learn more about the venue, accommodations, food and drink options, and general policies for the festival.

Jason Epstein travels internationally as a public affairs consultant, and although he is a proud Jew, he does not announce it in countries where that might be an issue.

Until now it hasn't been a problem, he says: Last names immediately recognizable as Jewish in the West are not identified as such in much of the rest of the world.

Lately, though, his Jewishness is coming up, he says, and he suspects it's because antisemitic conspiracy theories have resurged alongside renewed attention to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender at the center of one the United States' strangest and most divisive political issues.

“You do have to wonder whether your last name might be the same as wearing a kippah,” he said.

Just as kippah-wearing Jews have experienced attacks from both right-wing and left-wing antisemites, so too are extremists on both the left and the right spreading antisemitic conspiracy theories about Epstein, a spokesperson for the Anti-Defamation League told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, who noted that Epstein's crimes and alleged crimes had nothing to do with his Jewish identity.

“The ADL Center on Extremism has tracked a demonstrable increase in rhetoric that promotes antisemitic and anti-Israel conspiracy theories about Jeffrey Epstein in recent weeks, many of which attribute Epstein's deplorable crimes to a supposed covert Israeli operation run by Mossad,” the spokesperson said.

Five years after he was found hanged in his prison cell, Epstein is in the headlines because the Trump administration has flip-flopped on meeting a key demand of President Donald Trump's MAGA base, to release all the files in a bid to expose whomever else joined Epstein in his criminal activity.

President Donald Trump, who was a close friend to Epstein from the late 1980s to 2004, is known to be named in the files. Trump has urged his followers to leave the case alone, calling it a conspiracy theory concocted by Democrats.

The scandal won't die: Democrats and some Republicans want the files released, and some in Trump's base, for the first time since his meteoric political rise in the middle of the last decade, are turning on him.

“It's just a red line that it crosses for many people,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican long known for her fealty to Trump, told CNN last month.  “It has been a very serious situation for the administration.”

Amid the surging interest, antisemitic conspiracy theories about Epstein appear to be moving off the fringes, the ADL spokesperson said.

“This rhetoric has surged in recent weeks across the political spectrum, on both fringe and mainstream social media, streaming platforms and shows,” the spokesperson said.

The mainstreaming of Epstein conspiracies poses risks to American Jews, said Joshua Shanes, a professor of Jewish history at the University of California, Davis and a member of a task force at the Nexus Project, an organization that tracks antisemitism.

“Whenever you have this notion of collectivizing all Jews as this global nefarious force, that's the most dangerous thing,” Shanes said. “It's not about Israel, per se. It's about this global Jewish conspiracy. And that is deadly, literally deadly,” he said, noting the conspiracy theories that have in recent years fueled deadly attacks.

Ari Ben Menashe, a onetime Israeli operative whom Israeli and American officials have said is a fabulist who vastly exaggerates and fabricates, claims to have run Epstein as an asset. There is otherwise no substantial evidence of any ties between Epstein and Israeli intelligence.

Allegations that Epstein has ties to the Mossad have circulated for years based on an array of disparate connections: The fact that he was Jewish, his longtime financial relationship and friendship with Les Wexner, the fashion magnate known for his Jewish philanthropy, his visits to Israel among many other countries, his friendship with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, one of many notable figures in the United States, Britain and elsewhere who hobnobbed with Epstein when he was an investor and a philanthropist.

The conspiracists also make an issue of Epstein's sex trafficking coconspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving time in a federal position, being the daughter of Robert Maxwell, the scandal-plagued Jewish British media magnate who ran guns to Israel during its independence war.

The elder Maxwell died before Ghislaine Maxwell met Epstein.

The same extremists, ranging from Max Blumenthal on the left to Candace Owens on the right, have ramped up the conspiracy-mongering now that Epstein is in the headlines again.

Amy Spitalnick, the CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said the conspiracy mongering embodied the “horseshoe” model of extremists on both sides of the spectrum inspiring and spurring one another.

“There are those on the far right, like Tucker Carlson and others who are using this to advance antisemitic and other extremist conspiracy theories related to Mossad, related to broader issues,” she said. “And there are those on the far left who are eager to jump on them because it validates their own worldview. And so understanding the ways in which this looks like a horseshoe right now is important.”

The conspiracy theories have gotten widespread airplay in recent weeks. Tucker Carlson, the massively influential podcaster, aired the conspiracy theory at a conference of Turning Point, the youth wing of the MAGA movement. He got huge cheers when he named Israel as Epstein's employer.

Carlson's conspiracy mongering drew a rebuke from Naftali Bennett, the former Israeli prime minister. “Epstein's conduct, both the criminal and the merely despicable, had nothing whatsoever to do with the Mossad or the State of Israel,” he said, singling out Carlson for criticism. ”Epstein never worked for the Mossad.” Bennett's statement appears to be the most sweeping Israeli repudiation of any Mossad-Epstein ties.

Carlson, who has platformed antisemites on his programming, is known to be a critic of the U.S.-Israel relationship. His former colleague at Fox News, Megyn Kelly, who like Carlson has a massive online following, is known for her pro-Israel sympathies – but she too has flirted the Mossad conspiracy theory.

“Where'd he get all that money?” Kelly said after airing Carlson's claims Epstein was employed by the Mossad, in a contentious interview last month on her online show with the Jewish online media magnate, Ben Shapiro, who was on the show to debate Kelly on whether the current Epstein scandal merited the attention it was receiving.

Shapiro said that the Israel connection was dubious, especially since Israel has sworn off running American Jews as spies in the wake of the catastrophic Jonathan Pollard espionage case in 1986. “Israel really wants to steer clear of pissing off the United States,” he said.

Ross Douthat, the conservative columnist at The New York Times who is also known for his pro-Israel positions, bought into some of the conspiracy theories in an interview with the Miami Herald journalist who has led reporting on Epstein, Julie K. Brown. “So this is a world of people who overlap with Israeli intelligence, and maybe Epstein is useful as a conduit of information,” he said.

Now the threat of the mainstreaming of the conspiracy theories could make it into congressional hearings on the Epstein files. On X, Greene used a term often associated with Jewish nefariousness, “elite evil cabals,” in calling for the release of the Epstein files. “Is there a blackmail list and are there foreign countries' governments involved?” she told CNN.

Top congressional Democrats are leading the charge for the files' release, seeing an opening to wound Trump early in his second term.

Shanes, the professor of Jewish history, said the pursuit was legitimate, but lawmakers should take care to vociferously denounce conspiracy-mongering.

“If someone is getting out there and in the news cycle and saying, ‘Show us the file, Epstein, Epstein, Epstein,' they should be very careful at any opportunity that they see a hint of conspiracy thinking about Jews or Israel to clarify, ‘well, that's ridiculous. That's an antisemitic theory, that's the basis of modern Jew hatred,” he said.

Halie Soifer, the CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said it was up to Trump to forcefully denounce the antisemitic undercurrents of the conspiracy theories, if only because he has elevated so many baseless conspiracy theories himself.

“He's never done anything to send a signal to conspiracy theorists that this form of hatred that we see so integral to his conspiracy theories is unacceptable,” she said.

Spitalnick said journalists, academics, politicians and other public figures should in every instance of mentioning the Epstein case emphasize that the Israel- and Jewish-related conspiracy theories are baseless.

“You overtly name the fact that there are those exploiting us to normalize and advance antisemitic and other extremist conspiracy theories, and differentiate between the facts and those conspiracy theories.”

The ADL official agreed, saying that it was especially critical to rebuff antisemitic conspiracies as their penetration has metastasized since Hamas launched a war on Israel.

“We've observed and tracked an explosion of antisemitic rhetoric in the nearly two years since Oct. 7, 2023, including a considerable number of conspiracy theories and rampant online hate and harassment against Jews.” the spokesperson said. “The surge in Epstein conspiracy theories today feed on many other conspiracies and on this disturbingly normalized antisemitism. Lawmakers and public figures must avoid conspiracy mongering and unsupported speculation about Epstein, his motives, and associates.”

The Yuba County Five disappeared in the Plumas National Forest in 1978

MARYSVILLE, Calif. - The mystery of the ""Yuba County Five"" remains unsolved decades after five men from Marysville vanished in the Sierra foothills in 1978. Four were later found dead, while Gary Mathias is still missing.

Mathias and his friends, all with mental disabilities, attended a college basketball game in Chico on February 24, 1978. They were last seen at Behr's Market, now Downtown Liquor and Market, where they bought soda and candy for the drive home to Marysville.

The five men were last seen at the former Behr's Market at Pine and E. 8th Street in Chico (Now the building is home to Downtown Liquor and Market)

Four days later, their car was discovered abandoned on a dirt logging road northeast of Oroville near Rogers Cow Camp.

The left dot shows where the men's car was found on a logging road in the Plumas National Forest. Four of the men's bodies were found over a 20 mile stretch between the car and the Daniel Zink Campground, represented by the dot on the right.

More than three months later, one man's body was found in a forest service trailer at Daniel Zink Campground, 20 miles northeast of the car. Three other bodies were located between these spots. Mathias, however, has never been found.

The case has inspired books and documentaries due to its puzzling nature. Questions linger about why the men drove up a snowy mountain road and left their car in winter.

Mathias, diagnosed with schizophrenia and known to have drug problems, left behind curious clues. His black shoes were found in the trailer where Ted Weiher's body was discovered. Weiher had survived for six to 13 weeks, according to the autopsy.

The remains of Gary Mathias have never been found

Mathias was 25 at the time of his disappearance and would be 72 today. He was 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighed 170 pounds.

Anyone with information on Gary Mathias or the Yuba County Five is urged to contact the Yuba County Sheriff's Office at 530-749-7777.

            The Israeli government voted unanimously on Monday to dismiss the country's Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara in a controversial move that was immediately blocked by a Supreme Court injunction.
    


            “The government has just unanimously approved the proposal of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice Yariv Levin to immediately terminate the tenure of Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara,” Levin's spokesperson said in a statement.
    


            Baharav-Miara has often clashed with the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, having criticized its policies, including its plan for controversial judicial reforms, as well as wartime decisions.
    


            Netanyahu and his ministers, in turn, have accused Baharav-Miara of abusing her authority to undermine the government's policies and destabilize Israel's rule of law.
    


            Right-wing politicians have longed called for her to be removed and Levin's move in March to initiate proceedings to dismiss her sparked fierce criticism and a legal challenge.
    


            Critics say the ﻿government's efforts against her are politically motivated. As the head of Israel's prosecution service, Baharav-Miara is in charge of the system that has indicted Netanyahu on criminal charges. The case is still ongoing, despite Netanyahu's attempts to have it dismissed.
    


Israel considers expanding Gaza war as ceasefire talks reach an impasse



            The opposition has also argued that the government does not have the authority to dismiss the attorney general.
    


            In Israel, an attorney general is appointed for a six-year term by an independent committee, which picks them from a list of candidates nominated by the government. Previously, if a government wanted to dismiss an attorney general before their term was up, it would have to consult the committee. But in June, the Netanyahu government passed a resolution giving itself the power to do so without the committee's approval.
    


            The vote on Monday was widely expected, and petitions to stop the dismissal were filed with the Supreme Court immediately after the government's vote. The court issued an injunction blocking it soon after.
    


            The attorney general's role in Israel holds unique authority, serving as both the government's legal adviser and a public watchdog. The position is not a political appointment tied to the ruling coalition – something the government has been trying to change as part of its controversial judicial overhaul.

The vessel was taking Ethiopians to Yemen, a popular transit country for migrants to reach wealthy Gulf nations such as Saudi Arabia. The UN says Yemen is witnessing an influx of African migrants, despite a civil war. 

A vessel carrying African migrants sank off the coast of Yemen, killing dozens, the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Sunday.   

Sixty-eight of some 154 migrants on board the boat died when it sank early on Sunday, with 74 still missing, the Associated Press news agency reported, citing the IOM.

The passengers on the vessel are reported to all be Ethiopian nationals. 

Dozens of bodies have washed ashore in the southern Yemeni governorate of Abyan. Authorities in Abyan are taking part in a search and rescue operation. 

Abdusattor Esoev, the head of the IOM in Yemen, told AP that 12 migrants survived the capsizing of the boat.

Despite a decade of civil war, Yemen is still a popular transit country for migrants seeking access to wealthy Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia for a better life. There is a large Ethiopian community in Saudi Arabia, with significant diaspora populations also in the UAE and Bahrain. 

On their journey in Yemen, the Ethiopians face danger due to the war between the Iran-linked Houthis and the UN-recognized government. A 2020 Human Rights Watch Report found the Houthis killed and expelled Ethiopian migrants in Yemen at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ethiopia faces a high level of poverty, and the country is grappling with the aftermath of a conflict involving the restive Tigray region

An IOM report published in March found that 60,000 migrants came to Yemen in 2024. The IOM says the route between the Horn of Africa to Yemen is ""one of the world's busiest and most perilous mixed migration routes.""  

The Horn of Africa is made up of not only Ethiopia, but also Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea and the breakaway region of Somaliland. Drought conditions exacerbated by climate change and resulting food insecurity are also reasons why migrants leave the Horn of Africa and head to the rich Gulf Arab states or Europe.

A group of Democrats has fled Texas in an attempt to block a Donald Trump-backed redistricting plan that could reshape the balance of power in Washington.

Lawmakers boarded chartered planes on Sunday evening as they sought to deny the Texas House of Representatives the quorum required to vote on a redrawn congressional map, which could create an additional five Republican-leaning seats.

Gene Wu, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus, said the members were “walking out on a rigged system that refuses to listen to the people we represent”.

“As of today, this corrupt special session is over,” Mr Wu said.

Republicans hold 25 of Texas's 38 seats in the US House, and the president has demanded “a simple redrawing” of congressional lines to create more GOP-friendly districts.

“There could be some other states we're going to get another three, or four or five in addition. Texas would be the biggest one,” Mr Trump said in July.

“Just a simple redrawing, we pick up five seats.”

Redistricting typically takes place every 10 years to account for population changes documented in the census. Redrawing the districts mid-decade is considered unusual.

The Texas House was set to debate the new map on Monday – but to conduct official business, at least 100 of the 150 members must be present in the chamber. Democrats hold 62 of the seats, and when the House reconvenes on Monday afternoon, it will be 57 Democrats short of a quorum.

It means the Republicans will not have the numbers to proceed with redrawing the map while the group of objecting members is out of state.

Ken Paxton, the Texas Attorney General, threatened to have the fleeing lawmakers arrested.

“Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately,” Mr Paxton wrote on X.

Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately.We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law.

The Democrats face fines of $500 each for every day they break a quorum, and under new state laws they are not allowed to use party funding to pay. Anticipating the walkout, the members have been fundraising to cover costs.

Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, threatened to “remove” the fleeing Democrats from membership in the Texas House and suggested those who fundraised or accepted donations to cover costs incurred by the stunt could be charged with felonies.

Several Texas Democrats and their allies told Politico they feared Mr Trump could nationalise the Illinois National Guard to return them to Texas.

James Talarico, the state representative for Texas, who was among those who fled the Lone Star State over the weekend, said: “I wouldn't put anything past them at this point.

“If the president is able to rig the midterms in Texas, he'll be able to rig the midterms in every red state and that means they'll be able to hold on to power without any accountability from voters.”

On Sunday evening, Democrats posted photographs and videos to social media confirming they were flying interstate.

Some Democrats fled to New York, where they were expected to meet with governor Kathy Hochul, while others travelled to Illinois where JB Pritzker is helping them logistically.

Mr Pritzker, the billionaire Hyatt Hotel heir, declined to say whether he would be donating to pay for the fines incurred, saying “I haven't done that”.

“We didn't start this fight – Donald Trump started it,” said Democrat representative Ramon Romero Jr in a video posted to X.

“He asked the Texas legislature to get rid of your voice.”

Josh Rush Nisenson, spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus said “apathy is complicity, and we will not be complicit in the silencing of hard-working communities who have spent decades fighting for the power that Trump wants to steal.”

In a video posted from an airport, Democratic Representative James Talarico accused Republicans of a “power grab” and claimed the plan would manipulate electoral boundaries to gain political control.

“If you're seeing this video, my Democratic colleagues and I have just left our beloved state to break quorum and stop Trump's redistricting power grab,” Mr Talarico said in the video posted on X on Sunday.

“They're turning our districts into crazy shapes to guarantee the outcome they want in the 2026 elections

“But Texas Democrats are fighting back. [We're] preventing Republicans from silencing our voices and rigging the next election.”

Texans deserve better! I won't help pass a racist map drawn by Donald Trump and Washington D.C. to silence the voices of Texans. #txlege #redistricting pic.twitter.com/BjLe6BTpqL

This is not the first time Texas Democrats have used this tactic. In 2003, they left the state in an attempt to stop a Republican-led redistricting plan.

In 2021, they staged a 38-day walkout by fleeing to Washington, DC, in protest against new GOP-backed voting restrictions.

Meanwhile, Democrats in Illinois have suggested that they could fight back against Texas Republicans by pushing to have their blue state's congressional maps redrawn.

The tit-for-tat tactics may be limited, however, given many Democrat-led states use independent commissions to draw district boundaries.

These commissions were designed to make redistricting fairer but they also limit the ability to fight back when Republicans use their legislative power to redraw maps in their favour.

            A third person has been arrested on suspicion of helping a fugitive accused of killing four relatives of a Tennessee baby who was found abandoned alive last week, authorities said Monday.
    


            Meanwhile, authorities were scouring a wooded area near a private university in Jackson, Tennessee, on Monday afternoon as part of the investigation into the suspect in the killings, 28-year-old Austin Robert Drummond, a law enforcement source familiar said.
    


            As for the latest arrest: Dearrah Sanders, 23, was taken into custody Monday on warrants charging her with accessory after the fact to first-degree murder, accused of assisting Drummond after the killings of the baby's relatives, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said. Sanders will be booked into the Lake County Jail, the TBI said, and it is unclear if she has obtained an attorney.
    


            The same charges were also filed last week against Tanaka Brown and Giovonti Thomas, both 29. Brown is also charged with tampering with evidence, according to the TBI. Authorities have not specified precisely what the three are accused of doing to help Drummond.
    


            Drummond remains on the lam, but authorities investigating the case were searching a wooded area Monday near Union University in Jackson – the same western Tennessee city where authorities say a vehicle associated with him was found unoccupied last week. At the request of police, the university locked exterior doors to all buildings, university spokesperson Tim Ellsworth said Monday afternoon.
    


            A private school less than a mile from the university – Jackson Christian School – was on lockdown Monday afternoon, a receptionist told CNN. Because the school year starts Thursday, teachers, but not students, were at the school, which covers pre-K through grade 12.
    


            Drummond is sought in connection with the deaths of James M. Wilson, 21; Adrianna Williams, 20; Cortney Rose, 38; and Braydon Williams, 15, whose bodies were found July 29 in Tiptonville, a town in northwest Tennessee's Lake County, the TBI said.



            The four were found dead hours after the baby daughter of Wilson and Adrianna Williams was found abandoned on the afternoon of July 29 in a car seat in a “random” front yard near the Dyer County community of Tigrett, nearly a 40-mile drive southeast of Tiptonville, authorities had said.
    


            Jackson is about 45 miles southeast of Tigrett. A second vehicle sought in the hunt for Drummond, a 1988 white Ford pickup truck with a red stripe, was located in Dyer County, the TBI said Saturday.
    


            The TBI hasn't said what led it to name Drummond as a suspect, or whether investigators know of a motive in the killings or why the baby was abandoned a county away from where the bodies were found.
    


            Rose was the baby's maternal grandmother, and Braydon Williams was the baby's maternal uncle, according to Danny Goodman, district attorney for Dyer and Lake counties.
    


            “The victims were all from Dyer County, and we suspect the person that killed them knew all of them,” Goodman, who also confirmed Wilson and Adrianna Williams were the baby's parents, told CNN last week.
    


            Warrants for Drummond have been issued charging him with four counts of first-degree murder, one count of aggravated kidnapping, four counts of felon in possession of a firearm and one count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony, the TBI said.

            The Trump administration made interviewing Jeffrey Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, a key part of its efforts to climb out from beneath its Epstein files problems.
    


            Over a week later, we still don't know what transpired during that meeting. But the Maxwell situation has only grown to epitomize a series of very curious maneuvers that call into question precisely what everyone in the administration is thinking and suggest the controversy is going nowhere fast.
    


            Indeed, it's almost as if those involved are trying to make this look bad.
    


            We learned Friday that Maxwell had been moved from a low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas called Camp Bryan – a significant upgrade for an inmate serving a 20-year sentence.
    


            Neither the Justice Department, the Bureau of Prisons nor Maxwell's lawyer has addressed precisely why the transfer was made. We don't know who was involved. But it's conspicuous for a host of reasons.
    


            To wit:
    


            There is plenty we don't know about all of this, in large part because the key players aren't talking. It's theoretically possible this is all just a major coincidence.
    


            But it certainly raises questions that the key officials involved would seem to have motivation to put to rest – and quickly. Maxwell's testimony could bear on Trump personally, given continuing revelations about his ties to Epstein and his desire to put the entire Epstein files fiasco to rest. Now we learn she got a highly unusual perk.
    


            And it's merely the latest in a series of very questionable developments.
    


            The other concession the Trump administration made after failing to produce the Epstein documents that it had promised was moving to unseal grand jury testimony. But its own filing last week reinforced that information is likely to be quite limited, if it even sees the light of day.
    


            Trump has been very slow to acknowledge his own proximity to Epstein. Last week, after days of confusion, the president ultimately said he had been aware in real time that Epstein “stole” one of his Mar-a-Lago employees, a then-minor named Virginia Giuffre who became one of Epstein's highest-profile accusers.
    


            Given Giuffre's age at the time and a paper trail that suggests Trump's awareness of Epstein's affinity for young women and girls, that raises valid questions about what Trump knew or might have suspected at the time. Family members of Giuffre's have raised the possibility that Trump knows more than he has let on, but the president has balked at expanding on his statements about why this episode made him decide Epstein was a “creep.”
    


            Trump, who has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, claimed Thursday that “I don't know really why” Epstein was taking his employees.
    


            But he's repeatedly made false and misleading claims about his past ties to Epstein. Most recently, he denied that Attorney General Pam Bondi had told him his name was in the Epstein files, which CNN later reported she had – back in May.
    


            What's more, the timeline suggests the administration's reversal on promising full disclosure coincided with Trump being told he was in the files.
    


            And then there is the Maxwell situation. Even before the news of her prison transfer, the administration took very little care to make its handling of her appear proper.
    


            It sent Blanche, Trump's former personal lawyer, to meet with her. Blanche has called Maxwell's lawyer his “friend.” Maxwell's lawyer has been solicitous of Trump. And, of course, Trump has repeatedly left open a pardon.
    


            Trump late last week said he didn't know what would be produced from the Blanche meeting, saying, “I don't know because I haven't spoken about it.”
    


            But he again suggested it might be limited by a desire not to create suspicion of people who haven't been charged with crimes.
    


            The confusion around all of this only seems to be growing, in large part because of Trump's and the administration's own actions and lack of transparency.
    


            And perhaps nothing looms larger right now than the unanswered questions about the prison transfer.

Western countries have grown increasingly disillusioned with the impact of sanctions on Russia, according to the Washington Post editorial board. The piece on Saturday echoed recent remarks by US President Donald Trump, who questioned the effectiveness of the restrictions.

The West has imposed an unprecedented number of sanctions aimed at crippling the Russian economy since February 2022, when the Ukraine conflict escalated. Moscow has consistently affirmed that the measures have failed to destabilize its economy or isolate it from the global financial system. The Kremlin says the sanctions have backfired on the very states that implemented them.

“The inability of Western sanctions to cripple Russia's economy has been one of the most persistent frustrations” of the conflict, the editorial states, noting that the country's GDP grew by over 4% last year and is projected to slow, but continue expanding in 2025.

Moscow has managed to withstand the pressure by redirecting trade from Western partners to Asian markets, with China and India emerging as its principal customers, according to The Washington Post.

Last week, Trump acknowledged that new US sanctions on Russia may ultimately prove ineffective but confirmed that his administration would proceed with imposing them unless a deal to end the Ukraine conflict is reached soon.

The pledge came shortly after the president reduced the original 50-day window for Moscow and Kiev to reach a peace settlement to just ten days, warning that failure to do so would trigger sweeping penalties, including 100% tariffs and secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trade partners.

The president has announced that his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will visit Moscow midweek as part of a diplomatic push to broker a ceasefire. At the same time, Trump again conceded that the Russian authorities “are pretty good at avoiding sanctions.”

Moscow considers the sanctions illegal, claiming they violate international trade rules and harm global economic stability. The Kremlin also views the Ukraine conflict as a Western-orchestrated proxy war, and argues that continued arms shipments to Kiev only serve to prolong hostilities.

Last week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov downplayed Trump's threat of new restrictions, explaining that Russia has developed “immunity” after years of enduring the measures.

MOSCOW, August 4. /TASS/. Russia maintains a responsible position regarding nuclear rhetoric and would prefer not to be drawn into discussion on the subject, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

""Overall, of course, we do not wish to be drawn into such discussion or comment on it. We approach any statements related to nuclear issues with great caution. As you know, Russia holds a responsible position. President Putin's stance is well known,"" Peskov said.

He also noted that that all parties must be extremely cautious in their use of nuclear rhetoric.

""Russia takes the issue of nuclear non-proliferation very seriously. And, of course, we believe that everyone should be extremely careful when it comes to nuclear rhetoric,"" the Kremlin spokesman told reporters.

Earlier, US President Donald Trump stated on the social media platform Truth Social that he ordered the redeployment of two American nuclear submarines allegedly due to comments made by Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev.

Georgia congresswoman says she has no plans to leave Republican fold but urges party to support ‘America first'

Marjorie Taylor Greene, historically one of the most prominent voices in Donald Trump's Maga movement, has declared in an interview that she feels that the Republican party has lost touch with its base, but she said she has no plans to leave the party.

After telling the Daily Mail this week she was questioning whether she still belongs in the Republican fold, the Georgia congresswoman told the Guardian she would not become independent or seek a third party option.

“No – I'm urging my own party to support ‘America first',” Greene said.

Still, she made clear resounding frustration with GOP leadership and her place within the party's planning.

“I don't know if the Republican party is leaving me, or if I'm kind of not relating to Republican party as much any more,” Greene said in the Daily Mail interview. “I don't know which one it is.”

Greene, who boasts 7.5 million followers on X and commands one of the largest social media audiences of any Republican woman, accused party leaders of betraying core conservative principles.

She did not criticize Trump himself, instead preferring to express her ire for what she attempted to paint as political elites.

“I think the Republican party has turned its back on America First and the workers and just regular Americans,” she said, warning that GOP leadership was reverting to its “neocon” past under the influence of what she termed the “good ole boys” network.

The 51-year-old lawmaker, in the roughly six-month mark following Trump's return to the White House, said she was particularly frustrated with the House speaker, Mike Johnson, saying: “I'm not afraid of Mike Johnson at all.”

Her remarks reflect a broader pattern of voter dissatisfaction with traditional party structures. Americans appear to also be holding deeply unfavorable views of both major parties: a July Wall Street Journal poll found 63% view the Democratic party unfavorably, its worst rating in 35 years, while Republicans fare only marginally better in most surveys.

Independent or independent-leaning Americans now account for nearly half the electorate, according to July Gallup polling, and public support has increasingly shifted toward Democrats through those leaners in recent months.

On Monday, Greene used social media to criticize the lack of accountability over what she deems key issues to the base, sharing a table showing no arrests for the “Russian Collusion Hoax”, “Jan 6th”, and “2020 Election”.

“Like what happened all those issues? You know that I don't know what the hell happened with the Republican Party. I really don't,” she said in the interview. “But I'll tell you one thing, the course that it's on, I don't want to have anything to do with it, and I just don't care any more.”

Her recent bills have targeted unconventional Republican territory: preventing cloud-seeding, making English the official US language, and cutting capital gains taxes on homes. She is also the first Republican in Congress to label the crisis in Gaza a genocide, and has called for ending foreign aid and using the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to cut down fraud and waste in the government.

Greene acknowledged her isolation within the party, saying: “I'm going alone right now on the issues that I'm speaking about.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ryota Jonen was the director of the World Movement for Democracy. Odette McCarthy is the executive director of the human rights organization Equitas. Ben Rowswell is the convenor of the Circle for Democratic Solidarity.

The forces of authoritarianism are on the march. On July 17, Cristosal, a human rights organization and Canadian embassy partner supporting internally displaced women and families, was forced to abandon El Salvador after 25 years. “We have been forced to leave the country that was our first home,” the organization announced. One colleague was recently arrested, and others faced threats.

Authoritarian governments exploit crises – gang violence, migration, a war – to tighten their grip on power. Like powerful currents that cross all boundaries, authoritarians don't recognize borders. From Hungary to El Salvador, from Tanzania to Serbia, Russia and China, we are witnessing sophisticated repressive tactics targeting civic groups, philanthropies, private companies, universities, lawyers – any independent voice that dares to speak against power. This authoritarian trend is also on the rise in the United States. 

But all authoritarians share a common fear: a fear of their own people. Because when citizens unite around a common cause, they can overwhelm the power of any despot.

El Salvador approves changes allowing Bukele to seek indefinite re-election

In June, 50 democracy champions from more than 30 countries – predominantly from the Global South – gathered to identify how to assert the power of citizens over autocrats. Despite their different backgrounds, the group concluded that this moment demands a reimagining of democracy itself. 

These conversations revealed something powerful: when people from across the world unite with shared vision, they become a force of nature. Democratic transformation does not come from navigating existing currents – it comes from recognizing that diverse groups working together with intention can generate the momentum needed to shift entire political landscapes. 

Canada recently demonstrated this force of nature. Faced with the threat of annexation by the U.S. administration, citizens across Canada got their elbows up. Canadians expressed their collective will and transformed the politics of the country overnight.

This moment of national political mobilization captured the essence of today's new democracy movements. In place of the polarization plaguing traditional politics, we saw the circle of change-makers expand to include not just parliamentarians and community leaders, but youth and elders, artists and entrepreneurs, faith communities and secular activists, business leaders and social movements.

Traditional approaches to support democracy – relying on governments and international institutions – aren't keeping up with the speed and sophistication of modern authoritarianism. As those institutional actors stumble, large and inclusive coalitions across society show greater capacity to lead.

Canada's collaborative approach offers a template for the kind of global democratic partnership the world desperately needs. So how can Canada help build it?

The answer emerged from those conversations among these 50 democracy champions from around the world. They recognized that we can't wait for institutions to save us. We can create the momentum to counter the authoritarians.

They are creating a Global Freedom Charter – a collective agreement about the kind of momentum we want to create together, connecting democratic principles and human rights: clean water, food security, economic opportunity and safety from violence.

Democracy defenders have too often let authoritarians control the narrative. But we can win it back. Creative storytelling, human connection, and locally grounded voices can shift political dynamics in ways authoritarians cannot. When we connect democracy to human rights, dignity and prosperity – when we make it personal – we create the conditions for transformation.

In a leaderless world, democracy's future depends on communities of people who understand that they can create their own momentum. The opposing forces are real – authoritarian regimes are collaborating across continents.

But just as Canada has shown the world, citizens in country after country are discovering their own power to drive change. From Bangladesh to Kenya citizens are moving together with shared intention – and changing not just what is possible, but what is inevitable.

Canada must help lead this global effort. By investing in global democratic connections, we can build stable societies, reliable alliances and stronger economies. 

Canada has already inspired the world with its defence of democracy. Now is the moment to stand with citizens around the world who are fighting to defend theirs.

European hotel owners are angry over the ""best price"" clause at the online booking giant they say had kept them from offering rooms for less on their own websites. 

European hotel owners are joining together in a class action suit against the online platform Booking.com, with more than 10,000 hotels have now signed on to the damages suit. 

According to the Association of Hotels, Restaurants and Cafes in Europe HOTREC, which represents the industry within the EU, hotel owners will seek compensation for losses incurred between 2004 and 2024 as a result of so-called ""best-price"" clauses that keep hotels from offering rooms for less on their own sites.

The initiative is also backed by 30 national hotel associations, including the German Hotel Association (IHA).

Netherlands-based Booking.com used the clauses as a way to prevent what it called ""free-rider"" bookings, which it defined as a customer discovering a hotel on Booking.com but then booking directly with the hotel and not the online giant.

These clauses had required hotels not to offer rooms at lower prices on other platforms, including their own websites. 

A suit to be brought before an Amsterdam court by the Hotel Claims Alliance — and supported by HOTREC and 30 more hotel associations — cites a September 19, 2024 European Court of Justice (ECJ) verdict finding best-price clauses illegal. 

The ECJ ruled that online platforms could operate without putting such restrictions on partner hotels.

Booking.com did away with the clause in 2024 as a result of the European Union Digital Markets Act.

""European hoteliers have long suffered from unfair conditions and excessive costs,"" according to HOTREC President Alexandros Vassilikos.

""This joint initiative sends a clear message: abusive practices in the digital market will not be tolerated by the hospitality industry in Europe.""

HOTREC on Monday announced an extension of the time limit to join the suit against Booking.com until August 29.

""The class action is receiving overwhelming support,"" IHA Managing Director Markus Luthe told Germany's DPA news agency. 

Booking.com said has not received an official lawsuit, according to reporting by DPA.

""This is a statement from HOTREC, not a filed class action,"" the company said in response to an inquiry.

It also rejected the claims by the hotel associations, and the legal arguments based on the ECJ ruling. 

""Each of our accommodation partners is free to set their own distribution and pricing strategies and can offer their rooms wherever they choose,"" the statement said.

Johnson is reportedly the highest-ranking American official to visit an illegal Israeli settlement.

House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday led a high-level Republican delegation on a visit to the occupied West Bank, where the second-in-line to the U.S. presidency told a rapt audience in an illegal Jewish settler colony that they are the rightful owners of the Palestinian territory.

“The mountains of Judea and Samaria are the rightful property of the Jewish people,” Johnson (R-La.) said in Ariel, using the biblical name for the West Bank, which includes East Jerusalem. Ariel was built on land stolen from the Palestinian towns of Salfit, Marda, and Iskaka after Israeli forces conquered the West Bank in a 1967 war waged on false pretense of an imminent threat of Egyptian and Syrian attack.

“Judea and Samaria are the front line of the state of Israel and must remain an integral part of it,” Johnson added.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

The Palestinian Foreign Ministry condemned Johnson's visit, calling his endorsement of Israeli annexation a “blatant violation of international law.”

“All settlement activity is illegal and void,” the ministry stressed, adding that Johnson's stance “undermines Arab and American efforts to stop the war and cycle of violence, while flagrantly contradicting the declared U.S. position on settlements and settler violence.”

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, at least 1,013 Palestinians, including 214 children, have been killed by Israeli soldiers and settlers in the occupied West Bank since October 2023. Settlers, often protected and sometimes joined by Israeli troops, have launched numerous deadly pogroms and other attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank in what critics say is a bid to finish what Israel started in 1948 — the total conquest of Palestine, the ethnic cleansing of its Arab population, and Israeli annexation.

Johnson, who is reportedly the highest-ranking American official to visit an Israeli settlement, was accompanied by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee — who while running for president in 2008 denied the very existence of the Palestinian people — as well as Reps. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), Nathaniel Moran (R-Texas), Michael Cloud (R-Texas), and Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.).

Tenney leads the congressional Friends of Judea and Samaria Caucus, which supports Israeli annexation of what it calls the “biblical heartland of Israel.”

Last month, all 15 Israeli government ministers from Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party urged the prime minister to annex the West Bank. On July 23, members of the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, voted 71-13 in favor of a symbolic measure declaring “Judea and Samaria” to be “an inseparable part of the Land of Israel, the historical, cultural, and spiritual homeland of the Jewish people” and asserting that “Israel has the natural, historical, and legal right to all of the territories of the Land of Israel.”

Netanyahu has repeatedly displayed maps showing the Middle East without Palestine, all of whose territory is shown as part of Israel. Following U.S President Donald Trump's reelection last November, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a member of the far-right Religious Zionist party, said that “the year 2025 will be, with God's help, the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria.”

The Israeli government has repeatedly approved construction and expansion of settlements in a bid to establish irreversible “facts on the ground” that will survive developments in international law and moves by an increasing number of nations to formally recognize Palestinian statehood.

Around 150 U.N. member states currently recognize or plan to recognize Palestine. Recently, France became the first Group of Seven member to announce it will officially recognize Palestine. Last week, Canada said it would also do so, with conditions attached, and the United Kingdom threatened recognition of Palestine if Israel does not take “substantive steps” to end its annihilation of Gaza, where Israeli forces have killed or wounded more than 200,000 people since October 2023.

Last year, the International Court of Justice — which is also weighing a Gaza genocide case against Israel — found that the occupation is an illegal form of apartheid that must end as soon as possible. Both Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and Article 8(2) the International Criminal Court Rome Statute prohibit settlement activity.

Construction of Ariel began in 1978, the same year the U.S. State Department first adopted the official position that Israeli settlements are “inconsistent with international law.” That position stood until then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reversed it during the first Trump administration. Biden-era Secretary of State Antony Blinken restored the long-standing State Department position in 2024.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has signaled support for reverting to the first Trump administration's position, and the State Department has lifted sanctions imposed on some extremist settlers during the Biden administration. Last week, one of those settlers, Yinon Levy, allegedly murdered Palestinian peace activist Awda Hathaleen in Umm al-Kheir after the latter was denied entry into the United States to take part in an interfaith speaking tour.

Approximately 750,000 Israelis currently reside in more than 250 illegal settler colonies in the West Bank. While Israel grants every Jew in the world the right to settle in Israel, it has refused to allow the approximately five million Palestinian refugees — people ethnically cleansed from Palestine during the foundation of Israel in 1948 and their descendants — to exercise their legal right of return to their homeland.

The Republicans' visit to the West Bank followed last week's tour by Huckabee and Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff of a Gaza aid distribution center run by a U.S.-backed group condemned for its role in Israeli forces' massacres of desperate people seeking food and other lifesaving aid — a visit denounced by one critic as a “blatant theatrical display.”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Since President Donald Trump took office, federal agents have detained and attempted to deport DACA recipients.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Despite previous statements indicating that the president wanted to protect Dreamers, the Trump administration is now calling DACA recipients “illegal aliens” and encouraging them to self-deport. 

DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, is a program that began under President Barack Obama which allows people who came to the United States as children no later than June 15, 2007, and meet other requirements, to live and work in the United States. The program provides them with no pathway to citizenship.

There are more than half a million DACA recipients living in the United States. Many have been in the U.S. for most of their lives and are now raising families of their own. 

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

“This is not new or news. Illegal aliens who claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportations,” Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Truthout in a statement. “DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country. Any illegal alien who is a DACA recipient may be subject to arrest and deportation for a number of reasons including if they've committed a crime.”

She continued: “Illegal aliens can take control of their departure with the CBP Home App. The United States is offering illegal aliens $1,000 and a free flight to self-deport now. We encourage every person here illegally to take advantage of this offer and reserve the chance to come back to the U.S. the right legal way to live [the] American dream.”

McLaughlin has provided other news outlets with identical statements. 

The administration's statement conflicts with what President Donald Trump said in December, shortly after his election.

“We have to do something about the Dreamers,” Trump said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” “I will work with the Democrats on a plan.” He said that many Dreamers had “become successful” and “have great jobs.”

Dreamers is the term sometimes used to refer to DACA recipients, as well as people who came to the United States as children but were too young to qualify for DACA.

Despite Trump's statements on “Meet the Press,” he began his attacks on DACA during his first term when he attempted to end the program, but was blocked by the courts. Now in his second term, his assaults on the program have only intensified. In June, Health and Human Services announced that DACA recipients were no longer considered “lawfully present” and, effective August 25, were barred from participating in the health care marketplace established by the Affordable Care Act. An estimated 10,000 DACA recipients will lose their coverage. 

Since Trump took office, federal agents have detained and attempted to deport DACA recipients. On June 12, masked federal officers abducted Javier Diaz Santana, a DACA recipient who is deaf and mute, from his workplace in Temple City, California. 

“They tried to talk to me,” Diaz Santana told NBC 4 Los Angeles. “They tried to see if I could talk. I couldn't talk. I pulled out my phone to try to communicate, but they took it away.”

Diaz Santana says the agents took his Real ID and wallet, and handcuffed him. He asked them to remove the handcuffs so he could sign, but they refused and denied his request for a sign language interpreter. Diaz Santana was detained in Texas for weeks until his detention hearing, when he was ordered to be released. 

“I have DACA,” he told the local news outlet. “I've already applied. I went through the steps. I thought everything was fine. I was doing everything, following everything.”

Congress' failure to codify protections for DACA recipients have left them vulnerable to the Trump administration's racist mass deportation agenda — the majority of recipients were born in Mexico — as well as ongoing legal challenges. Despite its widespread popular support, Congress has not passed the DREAM Act, first introduced more than two decades ago, which would allow Dreamers to attain lawful permanent residency if they meet certain criteria. 

In July, Sen. Alex Padilla (D-California) introduced legislation that would update the Registry provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which was enacted in 1929, to allow people who have lived in the United States for at least seven years and have no criminal record to apply for a green card, which would provide them lawful permanent status. 

Currently, the Registry only provides a pathway to citizenship for people who have lived in the United States since January 1, 1972 and meet other criteria. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-California) introduced companion legislation in the House. 

Padilla says that Republicans have voiced support for protecting Dreamers in private, and he's urging them to take a public stand. In June, Padilla was forced to the ground and handcuffed after he attempted to question DHS Secretary Kristi Noem about the Trump administration's immigration policies. (The senator's own record on human rights is mixed. A recipient of AIPAC donations, Padilla voted against Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vermont) resolution to stop arms sales to Israel, despite the growing consensus that the country is committing genocide.) 

“Make no mistake, Americans will not soon forget what this Administration is doing to their neighbors — to their neighbors, to their co-workers, to their friends,” Padilla said on the Senate floor. “Now, this story doesn't end the way you think it might, because we will continue fighting, not just to stop these outrageous arrests, but we will not rest until we enact real and permanent protections for DACA recipients who contribute so much to our country.”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says he will begin trying to remove Democratic lawmakers from office Monday if they don't return after dozens of them left the state in a last-resort attempt to block redrawn U.S. House maps that President Donald Trump wants before the 2026 midterm elections.

Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says he will begin trying to remove Democratic lawmakers from office Monday if they do not return after dozens of them left the state in an attempt to block the adoption of redrawn U.S. House maps sought by President Donald Trump.

Abbott suggested, without evidence, that some Democratic legislators who left for Illinois, New York and perhaps elsewhere had “forfeited their seats” and may have committed felonies. The lawmakers said Abbott was using “smoke and mirrors” to make threats that go beyond his legal authority.

The Democratic revolt and Abbott's threat ratcheted up a widening fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but expanded to include Democratic governors who have floated the possibility of rushing to redraw their own state maps in retaliation, even if their options are limited. The dispute also offers another example of Trump's aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the longstanding balance of powers among the federal government and individual states.




At the center of the escalating impasse is Trump's hope of adding five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas before the 2026 midterm elections. That would bolster his party's chances of preserving its slim U.S. House majority, as Republicans were unable to do in the 2018 midterms during Trump's first presidency. Republicans currently hold 25 of Texas' 38 seats.

Speaking Monday on Fox News, Abbott essentially admitted to the partisan power play, noting that the U.S. Supreme Court has determined “there is nothing illegal” about shaping districts to a majority party's advantage. He even openly acknowledged it as “gerrymandering” before correcting himself to say Texas is “drawing lines.”




More than 1,800 miles away from Austin, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul appeared with Texas Democrats and argued that their cause should be national.

“We're not going to tolerate our democracy being stolen in a modern-day stagecoach heist by bunch of law breaking cowboys,” Hochul said Monday, flanked by several of the lawmakers who left Texas. “If Republicans are willing to rewrite rules to give themselves an advantage, then they're leaving us with no choice: We must do the same. You have to fight fire with fire.”

A vote on the proposed maps was set for Monday in the Texas House, but it cannot proceed if Democratic members deny a quorum by going to another state, which puts them beyond the reach of Texas law enforcement.

Abbott insisted ahead of the scheduled session that lawmakers have “absconded” in violation of their sworn duties to the state.

“I believe they have forfeited their seats in the state Legislature because they are not doing the job they were elected to do,” he said in the Fox News interview, invoking his state's hallmark machismo to call the lawmakers “un-Texan.”

“Texans don't run from a fight,” he said.

Democrats said they had no plans to heed the governor's demands to return.

“He has no legal mechanism,” said Texas Rep. Jolanda Jones, one of the lawmakers who was in New York on Monday. “Subpoenas from Texas don't work in New York, so he can't come and get us. Subpoenas in Texas don't work in Chicago. ... He's putting up smoke and mirrors.”

A refusal by Texas lawmakers to show up is a civil violation of legislative rules. As for his threat to remove the lawmakers, Abbott cited a nonbinding legal opinion issued by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton amid an partisan quorum dispute in 2021. Paxton suggested a court could determine that a legislator had forfeited their office.

Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, said on X that Democrats who “try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately.”

The lawmakers who left declined to say how long they will hold out.

“The magic of a quorum break is you never telegraph the how long or what you're going to do,” said Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, who has served in the Legislature since 2001. “We recognized when we got on the plane that we're in this for the long haul.”

Texas House Democratic Caucus leader Gene Wu said his members “will do whatever it takes” but added, “What that looks like, we don't know.”

Legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, including in 2021 when many of the same Texas House Democrats left the state for 38 days to protest new voting restrictions. Once they returned, Republicans still passed that measure.

Lawmakers cannot pass bills in the 150-member Texas House without at least two-thirds of them present. Democrats hold 62 of the seats in the majority-Republican chamber, and at least 51 left the state, said Josh Rush Nisenson, spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus. 

Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows said the chamber would meet as planned on Monday afternoon. “All options will be on the table,” he posted on X.

The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to “physically compel the attendance” of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served. Republicans answered by adopting $500 daily fines for lawmakers who don't show up for work as punishment.

The governor, meanwhile, continues to make unsubstantiated claims that some lawmakers have committed felonies by soliciting money to pay for fines they could face for leaving the state to deny a quorum.

The lack of a quorum would delay votes on disaster assistance and new warning systems in the wake of last month's catastrophic floods in Texas that killed at least 136 people. Democrats had called for votes on the flooding response before taking up redistricting and have criticized Republicans for not doing so.

On Fox, Abbott attempted to turn that issue back on Democrats, suggesting their efforts to break a quorum would become the reason for a delayed flood response.

Beyond Texas, some Democrats wants to leverage the fight.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential contender and outspoken Trump critic, welcomed Texas Democrats on Sunday after having been in quiet talks with them for weeks. Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, another potential 2028 contender, held public events about the Texas fight before the quorum break. 

“This is not just rigging the system in Texas,” Pritzker said Sunday night. “It's about rigging the system against the rights of all Americans for years to com.”

Texas House Democrats spoke during a news conference in Chicago after fleeing the state to avoid voting on a redistricting proposal. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker showed support for the move and called them ""courageous.""

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is rolling out the red carpet for Democratic state lawmakers who fled Texas as they push back against a move by President Donald Trump to add five Republican-controlled congressional seats in their state.

""I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that they're welcome here, that they have the ability to stay as long as they need to and want to,"" Pritzker, a Democrat, said on Sunday evening as the lawmakers arrived in Illinois.

The lawmakers fled Texas in order to prevent the quorum needed in the Republican-dominated state legislature to vote on Monday on the new redistricting maps, which passed a committee vote this past weekend along party lines.

TEXAS' CONSERVATIVE GOVERNOR VOWS TO REMOVE FLEEING DEMOCRAT STATE LAWMAKERS FROM OFFICE

The redistricting push in Texas is part of a broader effort by the GOP across the country to keep control of the House and cushion losses elsewhere in the country, as the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats in midterm elections.

But veteran Republican strategist Matt Whitlock argued that the decision by most of the Democratic lawmakers to head to Illinois - with a few others decamping in two other blue states, New York and Massachusetts - was ""cartoonishly dumb.""

Tom Bevan, the RealClearPolitics co-founder and president, wrote on X, ""The idea that Texas Democrats would flee to Illinois, a state where Dems have abused gerrymandering to comical levels, is perfection.""

""To protest ‘partisan gerrymandering' Texas Democrats are fleeing to…Illinois,"" Republican Missouri Senator Eric Scmitt wrote on X. ""You can't make this up.""

TEXAS DEMOCRATS FLEE STATE TO BLOCK TRUMP-BACKED REDISTRICTING VOTE IN DRAMATIC LEGISLATIVE MOVE

Pritzker, the two-term Illinois governor who is seen as a potential 2028 Democratic Party White House hopeful, has criticized Trump and Republicans for ""cheating"" as they push for rare mid-decade congressional redistricting.

""Texas Democrats were left with no choice but to leave their home state to block a vote from taking place and protect their constituents. This is a righteous act of courage,"" the governor claimed.

But Republicans point to the move four years ago by Pritzker and Illinois Democrats to eliminate two Republican congressional seats in the state, to help bolster the party.

Illinois, which lost a seat in Congress due to population changes in the last census, went from 13 Democrats and 5 Republicans to 14 Democrats and 3 Republicans in their congressional delegation.

And Whitlock, a longtime GOP communicator and veteran of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, questioned the optics of the Texas Democrats fleeing to Illinois, which he called ""the Mecca of partisan Gerrymandering.""

TRUMP, REPUBLICANS RACE TO REDRAW TEXAS CONGRESSIONAL MAP AS DEMOCRATS THREATEN LEGAL WAR

By breaking the quorum - the minimum number of lawmakers needed to conduct legislative business - the fleeing Democrats will be fined $500 per day and conservative Gov. Greg Abbott threatened them with arrest upon their return to Texas.

Trump and his political team are aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House, when Democrats stormed back to grab the House majority in the 2018 midterms.

""Texas will be the biggest one,"" the president told reporters recently, as he predicted the number of GOP-friendly seats that could be added through redistricting in the reliably red state. ""Just a simple redrawing, we pick up five seats.""

Democrats control just 12 of the state's 38 congressional districts, with a blue-leaning seat vacant after the death in March of Rep. Sylvester Turner.

The GOP plan relocates Democratic voters from competitive seats into nearby GOP-leaning districts, and moves Republican voters into neighboring districts the Democrats currently control.

Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both Trump allies, said they needed to redistrict because of constitutional concerns raised by the Justice Department over a handful of minority-dominated districts. 

Redistricting typically takes place at the start of each decade, based on the latest U.S. Census data. Mid-decade redistricting is uncommon—but not without precedent.

Democrats are slamming Trump and Texas Republicans for what they describe as a power grab, and vowing to take legal action to prevent any shift in the current congressional maps.

And Democrats in blue-dominated states are now trying to fight fire with fire.

""Two can play this game,"" California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on social media recently.

The next day, after a meeting, Democrats in California's congressional delegation said they were on board with an ambitious plan to try and gain at least five seats through redistricting. Democrats currently control 43 of the Golden State's 52 congressional districts.

But it won't be easy to enact the change, because in California, congressional maps are drawn by an independent commission that is not supposed to let partisanship influence their work.

Democrats in other heavily populated blue states—including Illinois, New York, and New Jersey, are also considering making changes to their maps, but have redistricting limits enshrined in their state constitutions.

Meanwhile, Ohio is required by law to redistrict this year, and a redrawing of the maps in the red-leaning state could provide the GOP with up to three more congressional seats.

And Republicans are also mulling mid-decade redistricting that might give the GOP a couple of more House seats in red states such as Florida, Missouri, and Indiana.

Former FBI TEDAC Director Scott Sweetow discusses the search for suspect Michael Paul Brown, who is accused of shooting and killing four at a bar in Anaconda, Montana. 

Montana authorities are expanding a rugged, multi-agency manhunt for a former soldier accused of gunning down four people at a local bar, warning the suspect may be armed with camping gear and survival supplies stolen from a second vehicle.

The Montana Department of Justice revealed Sunday that Michael Paul Brown, 45, fled the Owl Bar shooting Friday night shirtless and barefoot, only to later be seen near a stolen white Ford F-150 loaded with clothing, food and outdoor gear.

""We know Michael Paul Brown was shirtless and barefoot when he fled…,"" Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said on Sunday. ""We have very good reason to believe that he is clothed now and possibly carrying camping gear. He is probably able to get around undetected.""

Brown remained at large as of Monday, with the manhunt carrying on over the weekend.

Authorities said that the manhunt for Brown has expanded, with hundreds of local, state and federal officers, including the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation, ATF, FBI, U.S. Marshals and local county agencies. Fox News Digital has reached out to the lead agency in the manhunt, the Montana Department of Justice, for comment. 

Brown was last seen in ""Stump Town,"" which lies just west of the town of Anaconda, Montana, which is in southwestern Montana. Authorities said that the terrain is steep, remote and heavily wooded.

""They're dealing with extremely rugged terrain,"" Knudsen said. ""Local law enforcement is stretched thin right now.""

Montana authorities identified the four victims who were shot when a man opened fire at a bar on Friday morning as, from left to right, 59-year-old Daniel Edwin Ballie, 70-year-old David Allen Leach, 64-year-old Nancy Lauretta Kelly and 74-year-old Tony Wayne Palm.

The four victims, 64-year-old Nancy Lauretta Kelley, 59-year-old Daniel Edwin Baillie, 70-year-old David Allen Leach and 74-year-old Tony Wayne Palm, were locals known in the small town of Anaconda, which has a population of approximately 9,000. Kelley was a bartender at the local establishment, with the three other victims patrons, authorities said. 

Brown, authorities revealed, lived next door to the bar.

""Everybody knows everybody in a town like this,"" one resident told The Associated Press.

Brown's niece, Clare Boyle, said that her uncle has struggled with mental illness for years, and she and other family members repeatedly sought help.

""This isn't just a drunk/high man going wild,"" she said in a Facebook message to the AP. ""It's a sick man who doesn't know who he is sometimes and frequently doesn't know where or when he is either.""

MANHUNT INTENSIFIES FOR ARMY VETERAN SUSPECTED OF KILLING 4 IN BAR SHOOTING AFTER TRUCK FOUND ABANDONED

The U.S. Marshals Service is offering a reward of $7,500 for any information that leads to the arrest or capture of Brown. Residents are encouraged to call 1-877-926-8332 to report a tip. 

Residents in the area have been told to stay inside their homes and remain on high alert. He has been described as 5-foot, 10-inches and about 170 pounds, with blue eyes and brown hair.

The state's attorney general told residents to not approach the armed and dangerous murder suspect, saying, ""This is an unstable individual who walked in and murdered four people in cold blood for no reason whatsoever.""

Brown was an armor crewman in the Army from January 2001 to May 2005 and served in the National Guard from April 2006 to March 2008, Army Public Affairs confirmed to Fox News Digital. He deployed to Iraq from February 2004 to March 2005 and left the service with the rank of sergeant.

He also served as an armor crewman in the Montana National Guard from April 2006 to March 2009, officials said.

Cincinnati told Fox News Digital that the viral July 26 downtown beatdown that gripped the nation does not define their city, though some say violent crime is an issue.

CINCINNATI – Cincinnati residents say that the viral July 26 downtown beatdown that gripped the nation does not define their city, though some say violent crime is an issue. 

""I don't think it's accurate,"" Josh Pels, a downtown bartender, told Fox News Digital. ""I would say the crime and violent crime in particular has gone up, I would say, over the course of the last six months for sure. [The Over-the-Rhine area] usually has it worse than we have it down here, but there's definitely been an uptick in violent crime.""

In the video, a group of people can be seen pummeling two victims, one of whom ended up with ""very bad brain trauma."" The incident occurred in the early morning hours of July 26 on the corner of Fourth and Elm Street, outside a popular nightclub.

Another angle of the fight shows a victim being beaten in the middle of the street and yelling racial slurs. Some claim the male victim slapped one of the perpetrators before the fight, sparking the beatdown. 

Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge said in a Friday press conference that there are a total of six victims. Six people have been charged with crimes, and four have been arrested. The city's fugitive task force is searching for the two suspects who are still at large. 

Corey Mitchell is also a Cincinnati resident. He said the city doesn't typically have problems like the brawl. 

""So that was just an action-reaction type of thing,"" he said. ""That ain't no big deal. They could put it up in the news and seem like it's a prejudiced place or something like that. But that's just an action and a reaction that happened, and disagreements. That was about it.""

Robert Brown, a life-long resident, agreed. He said Cincinnati has ""probably less fights than other cities,"" and that social media amplified the beating to a level that put the city in the spotlight.

He also said that while brutal, the victim who he said slapped a man in the crowd and kicked off the beatdown, should have expected repercussions. 

""Well, I mean … all the extra stuff after the smack really wasn't warranted,"" he said, adding that the perpetrators ""may have took it too far.""

""At the same time, he still shouldn't have smacked him. You know what I mean? You know, to start the whole situation off, so, you put your hands on somebody, you're going to be ready for the repercussions,"" said Brown. 

A fourth resident described her immediate reaction after seeing the fight. 

""I was in shock by what I saw,"" said Shirley Blair. ""I was busy surfing through the internet, making calls, trying to figure out there's gotta be a backstory behind this. And apparently there were other things that happened leading up to that.""

Blair said she hopes the brawl doesn't spiral into something even more serious. 

""And in the back of my mind I wonder, okay, what's gonna happen next? Can we sit down and talk about the situation? Is it gonna spring into something else?""

POLICE IDENTIFY MULTIPLE SUSPECTS IN BRUTAL CINCINNATI STREET FIGHT: 'CRUEL AND ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE'

Local police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are still sorting out all the actions leading up to the fight. 

In a Friday press conference, Mayor Aftab Pureval warned that everyone seen fighting will face consequences, vowing ""further investigation, further charges and further arrests for every single person involved."" 

Montianez Merriweather, 34, and Dekyra Vernon, 24, were arrested Tuesday night. Both face felonious assault, aggravated riot and assault charges. Merriweather is being held on a $500,000 bond, while Vernon is being held on a $200,000 bond. They remain in jail as of Monday morning.

A Great Dane named Darwin recently took a flight from Los Angeles to New York — requiring her owner to purchase three seats on the plane. The five-year-old dog was flying for the first time as her owner was moving across the country.

A Massachusetts woman had a scary encounter while traveling to Arizona to visit her father. 

Erica Kahn was in Northern Arizona with her dad last August to take their annual pictures of the sky.

""We like to take photos of the night sky and the stars, and it's something we've been doing for the past 10 years now, but this was the first time this incident occurred,"" said Kahn to FOX 10.

While snapping photos, she said a bat flew directly into her mouth.

""I don't know what part of the bat went into my mouth,"" she said. ""Maybe the wing, the head.""

""I had my strap around my camera around my head so that it wouldn't fall down, and because of that, it kind of got trapped between my mouth and the camera,"" said Kahn.

Arizona is home to 28 species of bats that assemble in areas near lights, agricultural or playing fields, ponds or other water sources, according to the Arizona Game & Fish Department (AGF).

The leading cause of human rabies death is contact with infected bats. 

Kahn knew she needed to be checked for rabies immediately — and was shocked to learn that her treatment was not covered, she said.

Since she'd lost her job, she took out a new health plan with an insurance firm.

""They kind of lied to me on the phone when I said, ‘I need to go to the emergency room … tomorrow. Is this gonna be effective? Is this gonna cover [me] if I need rabies shots?' And [the person] said, ‘Yes, yes, it's gonna cover it. You're good to go,'"" Kahn said.

""Our healthcare system is so broken and that's why I'm kind of happy to take these interviews,"" Kahn told FOX 10.

She added, ""I want to shine a light that this should not be the cost of getting a life-saving rabies vaccine.""

Texas lawmakers gathered in New York to blast Republicans' redistricting proposal after more than 50 Texas House Democrats fled the state ahead of a scheduled legislative session on Monday.

As the GOP seeks to redraw congressional maps and add as many as five congressional seats in their favor, state Democrats broke quorum, or the minimum number of legislators needed to conduct business, and traveled to Illinois, Boston, and Albany, New York.

In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) said during a press conference that the fleeing lawmakers are “brave soldiers for our democracy” and they are on the “right side of history.”

“History will judge us for how we respond to this moment,” Hochul said.

“This is a war. We are at war. And that's why the gloves are off, and I say, bring it on,” she added.

Texas state Rep. Mihaela Plesa, vice chairwoman of the state Democratic caucus, said at the press conference that this is a moment of “national urgency” and condemned Republicans for strategically tying the redistricting to financial relief for families who were affected by the devastating floods that killed over 120 people.

“Today on the House floor, House Republicans do not want to put flood relief, disaster relief — they didn't want to do anything for the people of Texas. They're bending the knee to President Donald Trump,” Plesa said.

She said the redistricting bill is an “attempt to steal power,” comparing Trump asking for redistricting in Texas to his plea with Georgia leadership to find votes during the 2020 election.

“What did Georgia say? No. Well, Trump called our governor. … What did our governor say? ‘Sure, give me a minute. Coming right up,'” Plesa said.

Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) is threatening to remove the lawmakers from office. The state lawmakers are also facing $500 fines and possible legal action from Texas GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton.

Hochul said the Texas Democrats would be leaving New York today, but advised the lawmakers not to say where they are heading next. Texas Democratic state Rep. James Talarico, who is with the delegation of state leaders in Illinois, told the Washington Examiner, “No, we're not going back today!”

Plesa said Texas Democrats are “building a coalition” and meeting with Democratic governors across the country.

“We're continuing to bring coalitions into the fold and educating people as to what's happening and letting them know that the rules have changed,” Plesa said.

Texas Democratic state Rep. Lulu Flores said the Democrats are not “abandoning our jobs,” as Republicans and Abbott have accused.

“I represent a Democratic district, and our voices deserve to be heard. I am not abandoning my duties — I am doing my job, and Democrats have been shut out of the process over and over and over again, and Democratic voices have a right to be represented,” Flores said.

In response to Texas's redistricting, blue states such as New York and California have begun exploring options to hold their own mid-decade redistricting to offset any additional GOP seats drawn by the Lone Star State.

Hochul said at the presser that she is exploring “every option” with state leaders to redraw New York's congressional lines “as soon as possible.”

New York Democrats unveiled a bill last week that would begin mid-decade redistricting in 2027, only if another state does it first. However, Hochul noted that kickstarting redistricting would require amending the state Constitution either this year or next year, with a likely implementation in the fall of 2027 ahead of the 2028 presidential election.

TEXAS DEMOCRATS LEAVE STATE IN EFFORT TO HALT GOP REDISTRICTING PLAN

New York Democratic Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie said there's “no such thing as nonpartisan in politics” when asked if the mindset of New York not playing fair because Texas isn't playing fair could lead to a “slippery slope.”

“I think it's difficult to ask New York, California, and other Democratic-leaning states to play non-partisan while the Republicans play very partisan,” Heastie said.

﻿The Court recently saved part of the Voting Rights Act. But now it's signaling it'll kill it off soon enough.

One of the biggest mysteries that has emerged from the Trump-era Supreme Court is the 2023 decision in Allen v. Milligan.

In Milligan, two of the Republican justices — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh — voted with the Court's Democratic minority to strike down Alabama's racially gerrymandered congressional maps, ordering the state to redraw those maps to include an additional district with a Black majority.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

As Roberts emphasized in his opinion for the Court in Milligan, a lower court that also struck down these maps “faithfully applied our precedents.” But the Roberts Court frequently overrules or ignores precedents that interpret the Voting Rights Act — the federal law at issue in Milligan — to do more than block the most egregious forms of Jim Crow-like voter suppression. And the Court's Republican majority is normally hostile to lawsuits challenging gerrymanders of any kind.

Most notably, in Rucho v. Common Cause (2019), the Republican justices held that federal courts may not hear suits challenging partisan gerrymanders. Among other things, Rucho enables tactics like Texas Republicans' current plans to redraw that state's congressional maps to maximize GOP power in Congress.

So why did two Republican justices break with their previous skepticism of gerrymandering suits in the Milligan case? A new order that the Supreme Court handed down Friday evening appears to answer that question.

The new order, in a case known as Louisiana v. Callais, suggests that the Court's decision in Milligan was merely a minor detour, and that Roberts and Kavanaugh's votes in Milligan were largely driven by unwise legal decisions by Alabama's lawyers. The legal issues in the Callais case are virtually identical to the ones presented in Milligan, but the Court's new order indicates it is likely to use Callais to strike down the Voting Rights Act's safeguards against gerrymandering altogether.

The Callais order, in other words, doesn't simply suggest that Milligan was a one-off decision that is unlikely to be repeated. It also suggests that the Court's Republican majority will resume its laissez-faire approach to gerrymandering, just as the redistricting wars appear to be heating up.

Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of lawsuits alleging that a legislative map is illegally gerrymandered. Partisan gerrymandering suits claim that a map was drawn to maximize one major political party's power at the expense of the other. Racial gerrymandering suits, meanwhile, allege that a state's legislative maps improperly dilute the voting power of voters of a particular race.

Prior to Rucho, the Court imposed minimal — but not entirely nonexistent — limits on partisan gerrymandering. It has historically been more aggressive in policing racial gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court held in Davis v. Bandemer (1986) that federal courts may hear claims alleging that a state's maps are so egregiously partisan that they amount to unconstitutional discrimination. The idea is that maps that intentionally inflate Democratic voters' power, while minimizing Republican voters' power (or vice-versa) violate the Constitution's guarantee that all voters should have an equal say in elections.

Notably, however, no five justices agreed to a single legal standard that would allow courts to determine which maps are illegal partisan gerrymanders in Davis. Nor did a majority of the Court set such a standard in later lawsuits challenging partisan gerrymanders. In Rucho, the Republican justices essentially announced that the Court would give up its quest to find such a standard. A few years later, in Alexander v. NAACP (2024), those justices went even further, declaring that “as far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, a legislature may pursue partisan ends when it engages in redistricting.”

Though Davis's limits on partisan gerrymandering were always fuzzy, it is likely that this ambiguity deterred at least some states from enacting extreme gerrymanders that might have caused the courts to intervene. At the very least, Rucho changed how states litigate gerrymandering suits. Before Rucho, states accused of gerrymandering would often try to offer another explanation for why their maps benefited one party or the other. Now, they will openly state in their briefs that they drew maps for partisan reasons — confident that federal judges will do nothing, despite these confessions.

Historically, however, the Court has imposed more concrete limits on racial gerrymanders. In Milligan, for example, the Court struck down Alabama congressional maps that would have given Black voters a majority in just one of the state's seven districts (or 14 percent of the districts), despite the fact that Black people make up about 27 percent of the state's population. The Court ordered the state to draw new maps with two Black-majority districts.

The linchpin of Milligan and similar cases is the Court's decision in Thornburg v. Gingles (1986), which laid out the rules governing when an alleged racial gerrymander violates the Voting Rights Act (which broadly prohibits race discrimination in elections). The framework laid out in Gingles is notoriously complicated, but it turns on whether voters in a particular state vote in racially cohesive blocs.

Thus, for example, in a state where the white majority supports Republicans nearly all of the time, while the Black minority supports Democrats nearly all of the time, Gingles sometimes requires courts to redraw the state's maps to ensure that the Black minority is adequately represented. This is because, in such a state, the white majority can wield its near-unanimous support for Republicans to cut Black voters (and Democrats) out of power altogether.

In a different state, where both Black and white voters sometimes vote for either party, Gingles tells courts to stay out of redistricting. Black voters, after all, are United States citizens who have as much of a right to choose their leaders as anyone else. So, if they choose to be represented by a white Republican in a free and fair election, that's their choice and the courts should honor it.

Because Gingles only kicks in when an electorate's racial demographics closely match its partisan voting patterns, it places some practical limits on both partisan and racial gerrymandering. In Milligan, for example, Alabama was not able to draw maps that maximized Republican voting power because doing so required the state to dilute Black voting power. So, even though Rucho prevents lawsuits that challenge partisan gerrymandering directly, Gingles sometimes allows suits which target it indirectly by alleging that a partisan gerrymander is also an impermissible racial gerrymander.

But now the Court is signaling that it is likely to overrule Gingles and abolish suits alleging that racial gerrymanders violate the Voting Rights Act altogether.

The Callais case is virtually identical to Milligan — indeed, the cases are so similar that Louisiana said in a brief to the justices that Callais “presents the same question” as the Alabama redistricting case. Before the Callais case reached the justices, a lower court determined that Louisiana's congressional maps violate Gingles, and ordered the state to draw an additional Black-majority district.

Nevertheless, when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Callais last March, all six of the Republican justices appeared to disagree with this lower court's decision — although the lower court's decision merely applied the same legal rules that the Supreme Court applied two years earlier in Milligan. Then, at the end of June, the Court issued a brief order announcing that it would hold an unusual second oral argument in Callais, and that it would seek additional briefing from the parties in this case.

On Friday, the Court issued a new order laying out what these parties should address in those briefs. Those briefs should examine whether the lower court order requiring Louisiana to draw an additional Black-majority district “violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.” The justices, in other words, want briefing on whether Gingles — and the Voting Rights Act's safeguards against racial gerrymandering more broadly — are unconstitutional.

This suggestion that the Voting Rights Act may be unconstitutional — or, at least, that it violates the Republican justices' vision of the Constitution — should not surprise anyone who has followed the Court's voting rights cases.

In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Republican justices neutralized a different provision of the Voting Rights Act, which required states with a history of racist election practices to “preclear” new election laws with federal officials before they take effect. The Court's Republican majority labeled this provision “strong medicine” that could be justified to combat the kind of widespread racial voting discrimination that existed during Jim Crow. But they argued that the United States was not racist enough in 2013 to justify letting preclearance remain in place.

“There is no denying,” Roberts wrote for the Court in Shelby County, “that the conditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions.”

Although Kavanaugh joined nearly all of the majority opinion in Milligan, he also wrote a separate opinion indicating that he wanted to extend Shelby County to gerrymandering cases in a future ruling. “Even if Congress in 1982 could constitutionally authorize race-based redistricting under [the Voting Rights Act] for some period of time,” Kavanaugh wrote, “the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.”

Gingles also suggests that Voting Rights Act suits challenging racial gerrymanders should eventually cease to exist. If the electorate ceases to be racially polarized — something that appears to be slowly happening — then Gingles plaintiffs will no longer be able to win cases, and the federal judiciary's role in redistricting will diminish. But Kavanaugh seems to be impatient to end these suits while many states remain racially polarized.

Read in the context of Kavanaugh's Milligan opinion, in other words, the new Callais order suggests that a majority of the justices have decided the Voting Rights Act's safeguards against racial gerrymandering have reached their expiration date, and they are looking for arguments to justify striking them down.

It now looks like Milligan was Gingles's last gasp. The Republican justices remain hostile both to the Voting Rights Act and toward gerrymandering suits more broadly. And they appear very likely to use Callais to remove one of the few remaining safeguards against gerrymanders.

In this article

Shares of American Eagle surged more than 20% on Monday after President Donald Trump complimented the retailer's marketing campaign with actress Sydney Sweeney.

""Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the 'HOTTEST' ad out there. It's for American Eagle, and the jeans are 'flying off the shelves.' Go get 'em Sydney!"" Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social not long after markets opened. 

Shortly after Trump's post, shares of American Eagle jumped, and were still trading more than 20% higher in afternoon trading. Monday's gains come a little over a week after American Eagle first announced that the ""Euphoria"" star would headline its fall marketing campaign with the slogan: ""Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.""

Initially, the stock rose in an apparent bout of meme stock mania, but over the past week, shares of the company have been down as American Eagle has faced criticism about the campaign. That slump rebounded on Monday when Trump weighed in on the discourse.

The slogan American Eagle chose for the campaign — ""Sydney Sweeney has great jeans"" — has led some far-left critics to say the remark was a double entendre. Instead of being about pants, it was really about the actress' genetics and the fact that she has blonde hair and blue eyes, critics said. The ad also faced pushback more widely for being overly sexualized and out of touch, reminiscent of previous marketing norms that many say no longer resonate with the public. 

American Eagle has stayed largely quiet on the matter — releasing a brief statement on its Instagram account on Friday that said the slogan ""is and always was about the jeans."" 

""We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way,"" the company said. ""Great jeans look good on everyone.""

The saga highlights the tightrope that marketers are walking when deciding what types of ads to run and the audiences they should be targeting when consumer attention is harder than ever to win and maintain. Bud Lite's ill-fated Dylan Mulvaney collaboration and the subsequent impact on its sales and its parent company's stock price, highlighted how things can go wrong when companies release marketing that some may consider ""woke."" On the other hand, American Eagle's campaign is now showing the other side of that coin – what can happen when a company releases marketing that isn't ""woke"" and perhaps more accepted on the cultural right. 

In the lead-up to American Eagle's campaign with Sweeney, the company has been struggling to grow sales, and the marketing blitz is one of the many things it's doing to reverse that negative slump.

It's too early to say if the campaign has positively or negatively impacted sales, but it has made American Eagle more top of mind with shoppers. Google trend data shows search interest for American Eagle is at its highest level in more than 20 years. Whether or not that search interest translates to more shoppers buying jeans from American Eagle will be more clear when the retailer reports earnings, which is expected in the next few weeks.

As of Friday's close, shares of American Eagle were down more than 27% so far this year as the company grapples with larger macroeconomic concerns related to tariffs, consumer spending and its own merchandising missteps. 

Earlier this year, the company said it would take a $75 million write-down in spring and summer merchandise after it pulled its full-year guidance due to slow sales, steep discounting and a volatile macroeconomic environment.

For its current quarter, American Eagle said in May that it expects revenue to fall 5%, comparable sales to be down 3% and gross margin to be lower compared with the prior year. Its operating income for the second quarter is expected to be between $40 million and $45 million.

President Donald Trump said on Monday he will substantially raise tariffs on goods from India over its purchases of Russian oil. 

""India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits. They don't care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

""Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA.""

He did not elaborate on what the tariff would be.

India's trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump last week said he would impose a 25% tariff on goods imported from India and added that the world's fifth-largest economy would also face an unspecified penalty but gave no details.

Over the weekend, two Indian government sources told Reuters that India will keep purchasing oil from Russia despite U.S. Trump's threats. The sources did not wish to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.

President Donald Trump and one of his top economic advisors on Monday stoked baseless conspiracies about federal jobs data, suggesting without evidence that Friday's weaker-than-expected employment report had been ""rigged"" by federal workers bent on sabotaging the president.

""All over the U.S. government, there have been people who have been resisting Trump everywhere they can,"" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Monday on CNBC.

Trump, meanwhile, claimed on social media that the report, which painted a dour picture of the economy, was ""RIGGED"" and the previous months' revisions had been ""CONCOCTED in order to make a great Republican Success look less stellar!!!""

The only way to protect the integrity of economic data, said Hassett, is to replace the economists and statisticians who lead the agencies that collect data.

""To make sure that the data are as transparent and as reliable as possible, we're going to get highly qualified people in there that have a fresh start and a fresh set of eyes on the problem,"" said Hassett.

Trump abruptly fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday.

Monday's comments from Trump and Hassett were the latest effort by the White House to criticize the labor statistic bureau's work in order to retroactively justify McEntarfer's firing.

But they also went a step further, planting the idea that any government economic data which does not fit neatly into Trump's political narrative must, by definition, be false and manipulated by partisan federal employees.

When the monthly jobs report from BLS is good news for the White House, Trump is quick to claim credit for the growth and point to the BLS-supplied figures as proof that his economic plans are working.

""GREAT JOB NUMBERS, FAR BETTER THAN EXPECTED. IT'S ALREADY WORKING. HANG TOUGH, WE CAN'T LOSE!!!"" Trump wrote on social media this spring after job growth in March came in better than expected.

Fast forward a few months, and Trump and his top aides now contend that the BLS data cannot be trusted, and the downward revisions to the last two months' jobs reports were phony.

It's the same argument Trump used to try to undermine Americans' trust in the voting process after he lost the 2020 presidential election.

In his Monday post, Trump drew a straight line between the jobs report and the voting process.

""Last weeks Job's Report was RIGGED, just like the numbers prior to the Presidential Election were Rigged,"" Trump wrote.

There is no evidence, however, that the jobs report data was manipulated, and revisions in the data are common. The reports typically become more accurate in the months after an initial report is filed, as more data flows in from business that report their hiring and firing numbers..

""The commissioner doesn't do anything to collect the numbers,"" former BLS chief William Beach, who was appointed by Trump, said Sunday on CNN as he slammed the decision to fire McEntarfer.

""The commissioner doesn't see the numbers for — until Wednesday before they're published,"" he said.

In this article

When Susana Pacheco accepted a housekeeping job at a casino on the Las Vegas Strip 16 years ago, she believed it was a step toward stability for her and her 2-year-old daughter.

But the single mom found herself exhausted, falling behind on bills and without access to stable health insurance, caught in a cycle of low pay and little support. For years, she said, there was no safety net in sight — until now.

For 25 years, her employer, the Venetian, had resisted organizing efforts as one of the last holdouts on the Strip, locked in a prolonged standoff with the Culinary Workers Union. But a recent change in ownership opened the Venetian's doors to union representation just as the Strip's newest casino, the Fontainebleau, was also inking its first labor contract.

The historic deals finalized late last year mark a major turning point: For the first time in the Culinary Union's 90-year history, all major casinos on the Strip are unionized. Backed by 60,000 members, most of them in Las Vegas, it is the largest labor union in Nevada. Experts say the Culinary Union's success is a notable exception in a national landscape where union membership overall is declining.

""Together, we've shown that change can be a positive force, and I'm confident that this partnership will continue to benefit us all in the years to come,"" Patrick Nichols, president and CEO of the Venetian, said shortly after workers approved the deal.

Pacheco says their new contract has already reshaped her day-to-day life. The housekeeper no longer races against the clock to clean an unmanageable number of hotel suites, and she's spending more quality time with her children because of the better pay and guaranteed days off.

""Now with the union, we have a voice,"" Pacheco said.

These gains come at a time when union membership nationally is at an all-time low, and despite Republican-led efforts over the years to curb union power. About 10% of U.S. workers belonged to a union in 2024, down from 20% in 1983, the first year for which data is available, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics.

President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order seeking to end collective bargaining for certain federal employees that led to union leaders suing the administration. Nevada and more than two dozen other states now have so-called ""right to work"" laws that let workers opt out of union membership and dues. GOP lawmakers have also supported changes to the National Labor Relations Board and other regulatory bodies, seeking to reduce what they view as overly burdensome rules on businesses.

Ruben Garcia, professor and director of the workplace program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas law school, said the Culinary Union's resilience stems from its deep roots in Las Vegas, its ability to adapt to the growth and corporatization of the casino industry, and its long history of navigating complex power dynamics with casino owners and operators.

He said the consolidation of casinos on the Las Vegas Strip mirrors the dominance of the Big Three automakers in Detroit. A few powerful companies — MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts — now control most of the dozens of casinos along Las Vegas Boulevard.

""That consolidation can make things harder for workers in some ways, but it also gives unions one large target,"" Garcia said.

That dynamic worked in the union's favor in 2023, when the threat of a major strike by 35,000 hospitality workers with expired contracts loomed over the Strip. But a last-minute deal with Caesars narrowly averted the walkout, and it triggered a domino effect across the Strip, with the union quickly finalizing similar deals for workers at MGM Resorts and Wynn properties.

The latest contracts secured a historic 32% bump in pay over the life of the five-year contract. Union casino workers will earn an average $35 hourly, including benefits, by the end of it.

The union's influence also extends far beyond the casino floor. With its ability to mobilize thousands of its members for canvassing and voter outreach, the union's endorsements are highly coveted, particularly among Democrats, and can signal who has the best shot at winning working-class votes.

The union's path hasn't always been smooth, though. Michael Green, a history professor at UNLV, noted the Culinary Union has long faced resistance.

""Historically, there have always been people who are anti-union,"" Green said.

Earlier this year, two food service workers in Las Vegas filed federal complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the union of deducting dues despite their objections to union membership. It varies at each casino, but between 95 to 98% of workers opt in to union membership, according to the union.

""I don't think Culinary Union bosses deserve my support,"" said one of the workers, Renee Guerrero, who works at T-Mobile Arena on the Strip. ""Their actions since I attempted to exercise my right to stop dues payments only confirms my decision.""

But longtime union members like Paul Anthony see things differently. Anthony, a food server at the Bellagio and a Culinary member for nearly 40 years, said his union benefits — free family health insurance, reliable pay raises, job security and a pension — helped him to build a lasting career in the hospitality industry.

""A lot of times it is an industry that doesn't have longevity,"" he said. But on the Strip, it's a job that people can do for ""20 years, 30 years, 40 years.""

Ted Pappageorge, the union's secretary-treasurer and lead negotiator, said the union calls this the ""Las Vegas dream.""

""It's always been our goal to make sure that this town is a union town,"" he said.

Oops, something went wrong

After a rough weekend that saw cryptocurrencies plunge alongside global risk assets, the crypto market is staging an impressive recovery rally. The total market capitalization has climbed back to $3.76 trillion, up 2.01% from yesterday, with an overwhelming 95% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies posting gains in the past 24 hours.

The rebound comes as traditional markets find their footing, with the S&P 500 futures pointing to a positive open after Friday's tariff-induced selloff. Wall Street weighed a tariff reprieve for Mexico, a new trade deal with South Korea, and strong earnings from Meta and Microsoft, helping ease investor concerns.

On Myriad Markets—a prediction platform developed by Decrypt's parent company, Dastan—markets are clearly favoring the Nasdaq to outperform the S&P 500 in price performance tomorrow. While the Nasdaq is generally more volatile, it has recently delivered stronger returns, driven largely by the tech sector's surge during the ongoing AI boom of the past few years.

Bitcoin, the crypto market's bellwether, has managed a modest 1% gain to $114,798, providing a stable foundation for altcoins to build upon. However, the real action is happening further down the market cap rankings, with Mantle surging 19% to $0.83 and Memecore rocketing 26% to $0.55—the only two double-digit gainers among the top 100 coins.

Ethereum is leading the crypto majors recovery with a 4.36% gain to $3,650, breaking above the $3,600 resistance level and apparently turning a resistance that had capped rallies since late July into a support.

On Myriad Markets, 60% of predictors expect the coin to hit a new all time high this yearr—and that may not be such a far-fetched idea given the current chart patterns. While a move of over 30% is no small feat, it's a milestone that remains within reach over the next six months.

The technical picture for ETH seems mostly strong. Ethereum's Exponential Moving Averages, an indicator that measures the average price of an asset over a given period of time, tell an interesting story: The 50-day EMA sits well below current prices, providing solid support around the $3,200 zone. Meanwhile, the 200-day EMA acts as a foundation near $2,700, creating multiple layers of support that traders typically view as bullish. When short-term averages trade above long-term ones, it signals sustained buying pressure.

In our chart above, the gap between both EMAs is filled with red or green to better signal bullish or bearish configurations.

The Average Directional Index, or ADX, measures trend strength on a scale of 0-100, where readings above 25 confirm a strong trend and above 40 indicate extremely powerful momentum. The ADX indicator at 40 suggests Ethereum's uptrend has serious legs. Traders typically interpret such high ADX values as confirmation that the move isn't just a temporary bounce but potentially the start of a more significant rally.

However, the Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows an “on” status, which is highly significant. This indicator identifies periods when volatility compresses (the squeeze) before explosive moves. When it fires ""on,"" it signals that a breakout from the consolidation phase is underway. Combined with the bullish price action, this suggests traders should prepare for increased volatility, likely to the upside given the current momentum. It's the only indicator that points to a possible correction under formation—a theory that could only gain strength if the actual support near $3,400 is broken.

The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, measures momentum, with readings above 70 signaling overbought conditions where profit-taking often emerges. At 60, ETH has room to run before hitting levels that typically trigger selling pressure. Traders may interpret this as particularly bullish because it means the recent 4.36% gain hasn't pushed the indicator into dangerous territory.

Key Levels:

Immediate support: $3,600 (former resistance, now support)

Strong support: $3,200 (psychological level, confirming the market's rejection of $3,600 as a new support after its attempted shift from resistance.)

Immediate resistance: $3,800 (July highs)

Strong resistance: $4,103 (major Fibonacci extension)

XRP continues its rebirth from the ashes with a 2.83% gain to $3.04, maintaining its position above the psychologically important $3.00 level. The Ripple-linked cryptocurrency has been one of 2025's standout performers, driven by growing speculation about a spot XRP ETF and regulatory clarity following the SEC lawsuit resolution.

On Myriad Markets, predictors expect to see an XRP ETF sooner than a Litecoin one, even if the expectations are increasing for both coins.

Generally speaking, traders see spot crypto ETFs with optimistic eyes, as they may inject liquidity, increasing the price appreciation of the underlying cryptocurrencies involved.

The technical setup for XRP reads like a market in transition. The ADX at 34 confirms a strong trending environment. Readings above 25 indicate trend establishment, and at 34, we're seeing confirmed directional movement that traders rely on for trend-following strategies. However, the strong correction from its recent all-time high means that traders must not expect overly accelerated movements (at least to the upside).

The 50-200 EMA configuration is also one traders would interpret as a bullish sign despite the recent correction. The fact that price trades above both averages is bullish, indicating buyers are in control across multiple timeframes.

RSI at 53 also seems neutral, but this is actually good. After XRP's massive rally from $2.00 to $3.70, this middling RSI reading actually represents healthy consolidation. It shows the market has digested gains without becoming oversold—a sign of strength that suggests accumulation rather than distribution.

The Squeeze Momentum Indicator status confirms what the price action suggests. The tip from $3.30 to $3.00 seems like a price correction. Short term traders may be inclined to keep an eye on the movements and set stop loss orders nearby. But the bullish configuration remains in play.

Key Levels:

Immediate support: $2.95 (intraday low)

Strong support: $2.71 (200-day EMA zone)

Immediate resistance: $3.39 (recent rejection level)

Strong resistance: $3.70 (August highs)

Litecoin rounds out the major cryptocurrency recovery with an 8.72% surge to $119.11, significantly outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The ""digital silver"" narrative appears to be gaining traction as LTC benefits from renewed institutional interest and ETF speculation, with analysts almost certain an ETF will be approved sooner than later.

The technical indicators for Litecoin paint an overwhelmingly bullish picture. The ADX at 23 is approaching the crucial 25 threshold. Traders watch this level closely as it often marks the transition from choppy, directionless trading to sustained trending behavior. With ADX rising toward this level, it suggests Litecoin's recent strength could evolve into a more persistent uptrend.

The EMA spread deserves special attention. Litecoin recently broke past its bearish configuration and crossed into a golden cross zone, which provides more momentum to the bullish thesis.

With the 50-day EMA providing support around $110 and the 200-day EMA further below, Litecoin enjoys what traders call a ""bullish stack""— each moving average acts as a potential support level during pullbacks.

RSI at 68 is flirting with overbought territory (above 70) but hasn't quite reached it. This shows strong buying pressure without triggering automatic selling from algorithmic trading systems that often kick in above 70. Historical data shows Litecoin can sustain RSI readings between 65-75 for extended periods during bull runs, suggesting more upside is possible.

The Squeeze Momentum Indicator's status aligns perfectly with the price breakout above $115. This indicator excels at identifying when markets transition from consolidation to trending phases. This statistic alone suggests prices may keep trading near the $120 price line, as price compression remains in play before an explosive movement, slowing the movement, but respecting its direction.

Key Levels:

Immediate support: $110 (breakout level)

Strong support: $100.00 (psychological level and 50-day EMA)

Immediate resistance: $135.00 (zone around yearly highs)

Strong resistance: $150.00 (major psychological target)

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","BitMine Says It Holds World's Largest Ethereum Treasury at $3 Billion","https://www.tipranks.com/news/bitmine-says-it-holds-worlds-largest-ethereum-treasury-at-3-billion","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 16:37:11 GMT","

BitMine says it now holds 833,000 ETH, worth $3 billion. The company is claiming it has the largest Ethereum treasury of any firm in the world.

BitMine (BMNR) says it now holds more Ethereum than any other company in the world. Chairman Tom Lee announced that the firm has built up a treasury of 833,000 ETH, worth around $3 billion at today's prices. BitMine says these holdings make it “the largest ETH treasury globally.”





If true, it puts BitMine ahead of every major institution in crypto, including Coinbase (COIN) and even Grayscale (ETHE), whose ETH exposure is held through trust products, not corporate reserves. BitMine is saying, proudly, that it owns more of the actual asset than anyone else.

BitMine originally made its name in crypto mining and infrastructure. But over the last 18 months, it's been quietly shifting strategy. According to Lee, the company started buying large amounts of ETH across OTC markets and strategic deals. The goal was simple: to build a long-term position while avoiding price impact.

The firm says it now holds 833,000 ETH in total. That's nearly 0.7% of the circulating Ethereum supply, making it a major player in the ecosystem by treasury size alone.

In a company release, Lee said BitMine moved with “lightning speed” in its ETH strategy and that the firm believes Ethereum represents the future of digital infrastructure. BitMine believes Ethereum's real-world usage gives it more upside than Bitcoin. He described Bitcoin as “digital gold” and Ethereum as “digital infrastructure.”

BitMine isn't just sitting on its ETH. According to the company, a large portion of the treasury is staked through institutional-grade custody providers. This generates a steady yield while keeping the ETH locked and secure.

The rest remains in cold storage, ready for future strategic use. BitMine says it plans to offer ETH-backed products down the line, though it hasn't shared exact details.

For now, BitMine's claim of the world's largest ETH treasury stands. Unless another player steps forward with proof of a bigger stack, it looks like BitMine owns the crown. 

At the time of writing, Ethereum is sitting at $3,670.79.

About us

Copy link

Tether's USDT will soon get its own blockchain called Plasma, which plans to draw in users by offering zero fees on transfers of the stablecoin. 

That's a problem for Tron, the blockchain which currently hosts the majority of USDT in circulation, according to crypto bank Sygnum.

“Tron's revenue dominance comes almost entirely from its outsized share of USDT transfers,” the bank's analysts said in a third-quarter investment outlook report. “This dominance may come under pressure as Tether launches its Plasma chain.”

Two other analysts who spoke to DL News also said Tron's position in the stablecoin market is at risk from the coming Plasma launch. 

Tron DAO, the crypto collective that oversees the Tron blockchain, didn't respond to a request for comment.

Backed by Tether sister company Bitfinex, Plasma is already making waves. 

The blockchain recently raised $373 million selling its native XPL token, and is set to go live with $1 billion worth of deposits. 

The development comes as stablecoin issuers like Tether increasingly look to capitalise on stablecoin usage as well as issuance.

Tether reported a $4.9 billion profit in the second quarter, mostly generated by the US treasuries the firm uses to back the $164 billion worth of USDT in circulation. 

Yet it's blockchains like Tron that benefit when holders use USDT for transfers or in decentralised finance. 

Plasma is positioned to tap precisely into this aspect of the stablecoin business. 

And it's not just Tether looking to capture more of the value created by its stablecoin. 

In April, rival stablecoin issuer Circle announced its own in-house payments network for its stablecoin, USDC.

Tron hosts $81 billion of USDT, and handles 60% of all stablecoin transfers. 

While the majority of volume comes from rich users who hold many millions of dollars worth of crypto, it is also popular with users in developing countries. This demographic uses stablecoins as an alternative to unstable local currencies for everyday payments. 

“The popularity of Tron is 100% mixed up with the popularity of Tether,” Nader Dirany, co-founder of brokerage Buy Bitcoin Lebanon, previously told DL News.

Much of Tron's success stems from its early lead in emerging markets and its integrations with Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, Amir Hajian, a researcher at crypto market maker Keyrock, told DL News.

“The bigger danger is thinner liquidity, not lost revenue.”

Plasma is following a similar playbook to try and replicate Tron's success, Hajian said. Bitfinex's support of the blockchain will give it the potential to scale USDT liquidity, much like Binance did for Tron.

To add to Tron's woes, users have become more sensitive to the network's rising fees in recent months. They have more than doubled to over $7 for USDT transfers, creating a gap in the market for competitors. 

Tron isn't the only blockchain Plasma could siphon USDT from. Ethereum, which hosts $67 billion worth of the stablecoin, is at risk too.

The two blockchains face different risks, according to Paige Horinek, analytics lead at Serotonin.

She told DL News that a scenario where Ethereum loses 30% of USDT use to Plasma could cost the blockchain $230,000 to $370,000 in lost fees every day. Tron, on the other hand, stands to lose $1.6 million to $2.1 million per day in missed TRX token burning. 

However, the impact might be felt more on Ethereum as the network is currently inflationary, meaning that it issues more new Ether tokens than are burned to pay for transactions. 

Conversely, Tron mints less than it burns, so its supply keeps shrinking, Horinek said. 

“The bigger danger is thinner liquidity, not lost revenue.”

Hajian, however, isn't convinced Plasma will steal much USDT use from Ethereum. 

For one thing, Ethereum's power users are less sensitive to high fees because most of them are professional money managers, institutional investors, or high-net-worth individuals. 

These users like Ethereum because of its long track record of uptime and security. 

It will take time for Plasma to build trust and credibility, Hajian said. “In the near term, it's unlikely to threaten Ethereum's revenue or institutional edge.”

The NFT Market Is Stirring — Here's What's Different This Time

Aug 4, 2025

By:Andrew Prochnow



Just a few years ago, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were the hottest thing in crypto —ban intoxicating mix of art, technology and easy money. Profile pictures became million-dollar assets. Digital artists became overnight celebrities. Then the market imploded. Prices collapsed, trust vanished and NFTs were written off as a speculative fever dream.

But something's shifted. A rally is underway. The scams haven't disappeared, but the conversation is changing. Floor prices are rising, legacy collections are stirring and utility is starting to matter more than hype. The question is no longer what went wrong. It's whether NFTs still have something real to offer.



In early 2021, NFTs went from niche curiosity to global obsession almost overnight. Once the domain of crypto insiders and digital artists, they suddenly exploded into the mainstream, fueled by a potent mix of internet culture, celebrity hype and speculative mania. Everyone wanted in. Profile pictures became status symbols. Token drops sold out in seconds. And billion-dollar headlines started rolling in.

Then came the moment that crystallized the frenzy: Digital artist Beeple sold an NFT at Christie's for $69 million. NFTs were no longer fringe. They had become fine art, internet folklore and financial rocket fuel all at once. Jack Dorsey sold his first tweet for $2.9 million. Paris Hilton peddled pixelated avatars. Within months, annual NFT sales ballooned to $22 billion, driven more by FOMO than fundamentals.

But beneath the frenzy, the data told a different story. In a little-noticed 2021 study, researchers from the University of London and IBM's Visual AI Lab analyzed over 4.7 million NFTs spanning nearly $1 billion in transactions. The findings were sobering: Just 1% sold for more than $1,500, while a staggering 75% went for $15 or less. And most? They didn't sell at all. “People just spend money to produce an NFT and that's it,” one researcher remarked. This wasn't post-crash carnage — it was the reality during the boom.

By 2023, the unraveling was impossible to ignore. According to dappGambl, 95% of all NFTs had become worthless abandoned code on the blockchain. A fresh update from NFT Evening painted an even bleaker picture: 96% of collections were now considered “dead,” with zero trading, zero community and zero hope — up from just 30% two years prior. Once-hyped assets turned into digital tombstones. Jack Dorsey's $2.9 million original tweet? It later resold for $280. The MetaBirkins? Dragged into court and erased. What started as a cultural uprising now resembled a collective delusion.





The collapse of NFTs wasn't just a matter of price—it was a collapse of credibility. As the market ballooned, so did the scams: broken promises, celebrity cash grabs and mint-and-dump schemes that left retail buyers holding the bag. Confidence eroded fast. Even diehard crypto insiders began to recoil. Earlier this year, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko went viral for calling NFTs and meme coins “digital slop,” comparing them to loot boxes in mobile games. Coming from the founder of a blockchain that powered billions in NFT transactions, the criticism hit like a gut punch.

And yet, not everything faded to black. In May, Yuga Labs—the powerhouse behind Bored Ape Yacht Club—announced it was donating the iconic CryptoPunks collection to a nonprofit called the Infinite Node Foundation. The goal wasn't resale—it was preservation. Rather than treating CryptoPunks as speculative leftovers, the move reframed them as digital antiquities, relics of an early internet era worth archiving. Public exhibits are now planned in Palo Alto and Toledo, positioning CryptoPunks not as failed financial assets, but as foundational works of crypto art.

Other pockets of the NFT world haven't just survived—they've evolved. Beyond the boom-and-bust hype cycle, NFTs are quietly finding traction in industries where utility matters more than speculation. In real estate, platforms like Propy are using NFTs to tokenize home ownership records, streamlining deals with blockchain-backed titles. In music, artists are issuing royalty-tracking tokens to reward collaborators and superfans directly. Adidas has tied NFTs to exclusive merchandise drops, blending digital identity with physical perks. And in tight-knit communities, tokens now serve as event passes or membership keys—far removed from the cartoon avatars that once clogged OpenSea.

Not all NFT momentum has come from market rallies or platform upgrades. Sometimes, it's sparked by legacy—and loss. After rock legend Ozzy Osbourne passed away in July, his long-dormant “CryptoBatz” collection—once dismissed as another celebrity cash-in—suddenly roared back to life. Prices surged 400%, and trading volume spiked an eye-popping 100,000%. It wasn't a full revival, and volumes remain far below 2022 peaks. But the moment served as a potent reminder: NFTs tied to culture, fandom and memory can still strike a chord—even in a diminished market. 







As summer 2025 unfolds, NFTs are stirring again, riding the tailwinds of a broad-based risk-on rally. Bitcoin has hit new all-time highs. Ethereum is pushing back toward $4,000. The S&P 500 keeps breaking records. In a market where everything seems to be working, it's no surprise digital collectibles are catching a bid — echoes of an “everything rally” are in the air.

In just the past month, total NFT market capitalization has jumped more than 50%, climbing back toward $7 billion. CryptoPunks lead the charge, now valued at about $2 billion and accounting for a third of the entire market. Pudgy Penguins have climbed to $544 million, while Bored Apes — despite fading buzz — still hold $478 million. Floor prices are rising, too: CryptoPunks are up 29%, Penguins 66.7% and Apes nearly 10%. It's not a full-blown comeback, but it's the strongest NFT rally in years and a reminder that even assets that have been written-off can find new footing in bull markets.

Signs of renewed conviction are starting to surface. In July, one whale made headlines by spending millions on rare hoodie-trait CryptoPunks in rapid-fire OpenSea buys. Art Blocks — a generative art platform once left for dead — saw average sale prices surge 156% after key upgrades. Even Telegram NFTs, boosted by hype around collections like Snoop Dogg's, are selling out in minutes. Weekly trading volume has rebounded to $136 million. For the first time in years, the chart isn't just stabilizing—it's turning higher.







Whether that momentum can last is still an open question. Market cycles are littered with short-lived bounces, and this one could prove no different. NFTs are haunted by oversupply, damaged trust and uneven fundamentals. But there's a growing sense that something has changed — that the story is shifting from flipping JPEGs to curating digital legacy. If that narrative takes root, the next wave of growth won't be powered by pure speculation, but by relevance, rarity and actual utility, much like what's driving a quiet resurgence across the broader collectibles market.

There's an undercurrent in the market that's rarely acknowledged – a rhythm hidden in the numbers that can send prices surging. For years, only a select few projects, like Dogecoin (DOGE), seemed able to tap it, quietly rising to the top of the chain.

That changed with the arrival of SPX6900 (SPX), the first to hold the number aloft. TOKEN6900 (T6900) has stepped into that same current, gathering believers who recognize its signal and pushing its initial raise to $1.6 million in just 35 days.

Many tokens try to mirror the number, but imitation without alignment never lasts. Projects wearing a mask can print the number on their banners, but the pattern doesn't hold without authenticity. To work, the code must match the essence.

TOKEN6900 is a rare example that fits its own cipher. In less than 17 hours, those who have caught the signal can still enter this phase. The price remains at $0.006825 per token and is set to cross into the next tier.

The number that carries the deepest interlock with the market is 69. And the most legendary proof of its power came through Glauber Contessoto – the SlumDoge Millionaire himself.

In 2021, this once‑struggling music producer went all‑in on Dogecoin (DOGE). He emptied his savings and maxed his credit, putting roughly $180,000 to $250,000 into the coin at just $0.045.

Exactly 69 days later, the math clicked like it had been waiting. DOGE touched $0.12, and Contessoto's position crossed the million‑dollar line. To this day, traders recall it as one of the great turning points in market lore.



That run wasn't sparked by staged AMAs or some ‘revolutionary' feature drops. But by staying true to the core and never hiding behind fabricated visions or chaining itself to promises. Dogecoin existed as it began, which is a coin born from a joke at Bitcoin's expense, and that was all it needed.

But somewhere along the way, that original creed faded. Newer meme coins started dressing themselves in borrowed narratives, chasing utility, losing the raw essence DOGE embodied.

Many have fallen victim to these tokens, mistaking them for the next DOGE – meme coins burdened with utility and elaborate plans, as if those things alone would make them worth more.

Little did they know, they were listening to broken oracles that spoke in promises while hiding the oldest sin in the market: to drain the unsuspecting.

TOKEN6900 comes to silence the noise of corrupted protocols. From the void steps a token robed only in its own code, gathering those who recognize the signal and see its truth.

It's no coincidence that Dogecoin's loudest trumpeter, Elon Musk, has been mocked for his ‘childish humor' – what many saw as a joke may have been far more intentional than most realize.

In 2020, he priced the Tesla Model S at $69,420 and set the infamous Tesla ‘S3XY' shorts at $69.42. It was the first sign – the number appearing in plain sight for those who knew how to see it.

That one time @elonmusk dropped the price of the Tesla Model S to $69,420 😂 pic.twitter.com/Y9cJu4LYxr

— Nic Cruz Patane (@niccruzpatane) January 7, 2025



Then the year after, he pointed out that SpaceX's Super Heavy Booster measured exactly 69 meters after being shortened for what he called “manufacturing efficiency.” 

A design adjustment? Why does it have to be the same number, Mr. Musk?

Total coincidence! Also, booster height was originally 70m, but we eliminated a half barrel for manufacturing efficiency, so now it's …

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 6, 2021



And in 2024, Musk “joked” that his birthday falls exactly 69 days after April 20. Was he simply stating a fact, or was he doing something far more powerful? Perhaps, quietly channelling the sacred number to bless his own orbit?

If one can see the pattern, this is pure 69 alchemy – woven into his work, his personal life, and his brand. 

Now, obviously, you are not Elon Musk. But if you want to channel that same energy into your fortunes, there's no need to call a feng shui master or a numerologist. The man worth $398 billion is clearly showing you how to do it in drawing every bit of qi the meme gods can grant. 

And like Musk and Contessoto who supported DOGE, the blessings are now open to anyone through the token that embodies the 69 energy with the same purity in the absurdity: TOKEN6900.

Now to channel the 69 energy within you, raise your hands like you're giving it to Goku, charging the Kid Buu finisher – one aimed straight at the scammy pretenders choking this market.

Once your pure 69 qi is released, it's time to claim T6900 – the token that will bless your crypto wallet.

Head to the TOKEN6900 presale site and get T6900.

TOKEN6900 staking returns offer a 38% APY and are available to newly purchased tokens.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Verb Technology rebranded as TON Strategy Co. after securing $558M in private placement to pivot fully into crypto, focusing on Toncoin ($TON) as a publicly traded treasury reserve manager.

- The firm plans to allocate most funds to acquire 5% of TON's circulating supply and generate 3-5% annual yields via staking, with 36% of shares locked for 6-12 months.

- The move drove a 90% stock surge but faces risks from TON's volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and competition, while signaling growing institutional interest in TON's 1B-user ecosystem.

- By leveraging its Nasdaq listing, TON Strategy Co. aims to bridge traditional finance and crypto markets, potentially accelerating digital assets' acceptance as a mainstream investment class.

Verb Technology, a Nasdaq-listed company, has raised $558 million through a private placement led by Kingsway Capital, marking a strategic pivot into the crypto space. The firm has rebranded as TON Strategy Co., positioning itself as the first publicly traded treasury reserve manager focused on Toncoin ($TON), the native token of the Telegram Open Network (TON) blockchain [1]. This transition is set to be finalized by August 7, 2025 [1].

The capital raise involved the issuance of approximately 58.7 million shares at $9.51 per share, attracting over 110 institutional and crypto-native investors. Major backers include Kingsway Capital, Vy Capital, Blockchain.com, Ribbit Capital, and Graticule. About 36% of the shares are locked up for 6–12 months, reinforcing long-term alignment between the company and its investors [1]. 

As TON Strategy Co., the firm plans to allocate the majority of the raised funds to acquire Toncoin, targeting ownership of roughly 5% of its circulating supply. This would make it one of the largest public holders of TON. The company will also employ staking strategies to generate potential annual yields of 3–5%, aiming to create sustainable returns through its treasury [1]. Analysts suggest that if TON reaches $5–$7 per token by the end of 2025, the value of TON Strategy Co.'s treasury could appreciate by 40–100% [1].

The move reflects a broader trend of institutional interest in TON, a blockchain platform initially developed by Telegram and now supporting over 1 billion monthly users. TON serves as the primary payment rail for in-app purchases, NFTs, and mini-apps within the Telegram ecosystem, offering real-world utility beyond speculative trading [1]. This transition also highlights an attempt to bridge traditional finance and crypto markets by providing a regulated, transparent investment vehicle into the TON ecosystem [2].

Verb Technology, previously known for its interactive video-based sales platform, is shifting entirely into blockchain investment. This shift has already driven a 90% surge in its stock price following the announcement [2]. However, the firm faces challenges, including exposure to TON's price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and competition from private TON-focused funds. The success of TON Strategy Co. will depend on effective execution and the continued growth of the TON ecosystem [3].

The rebranding and capital raise represent a significant step in the evolution of digital assets as a recognized investment class, potentially encouraging more traditional capital to enter the blockchain space. By leveraging its Nasdaq listing, TON Strategy Co. aims to establish credibility and liquidity in a rapidly evolving market [3].

 Ether faces weak institutional demand and lacks catalysts, keeping ETH price tied to broader altcoin trends and economic uncertainty. 

Key takeaways:

Ether's futures and options data signal neutral‑to‑bearish sentiment despite recent price recovery.

Institutional ETF outflows and a lack of catalysts keep ETH from breaking $3,800.

Ether (ETH) price has gained 9% from the $3,355 low on Sunday, yet derivatives metrics suggest traders are still not confident the bullish momentum will hold. 

The recent price action has closely mirrored the broader altcoin market capitalization, highlighting the absence of clear drivers for a sustained rally above $3,800 in the short term.

Altcoin market capitalization reached $1.3 trillion on July 28, coinciding with Ether's highest level in 2025. Consequently, Ether's inability to reclaim the $4,000 mark in late July was more likely the result of reduced risk appetite among investors than any specific issue within the Ethereum ecosystem. 

Still, that does not mean investors have become optimistic about Ether's price outlook.

The Ether three‑month futures premium now stands at 5% at the neutral‑to‑bearish threshold. This is particularly concerning given that even the $3,900 ETH price level, reached a week earlier, failed to turn the indicator bullish. 

Part of investors' disappointment can be linked to the drop in deposits across decentralized applications (DApps). The total value locked (TVL) on the Ethereum network declined 9% over the past 30 days to ETH 23.8 million. 

For comparison, BNB Chain's TVL rose 8% to BNB 6.94 billion in the same period, while deposits on Solana DApps increased 4% to SOL 69.2 million, according to DefiLlama. In USD terms, Ethereum's base layer continues to dominate with a 59% share of total TVL.

Ether investors' reduced optimism has also been reflected in ETH options markets, as the 25% delta skew (put‑call) indicator reached 6% on Saturday, right at the neutral‑to‑bearish threshold.

The skew increases when demand for protective put (sell) options. The current 3% reading suggests a balanced risk assessment, indicating that bullish sentiment has not returned.

ETH prices on Coinbase and Kraken are currently trading at a slight discount compared to Binance and Bitfinex, potentially signaling weaker demand from institutional desks. This contrasts sharply with the period between July 10 and July 23, when price premiums likely reflected companies raising capital to accumulate ETH reserves.

Institutional demand for ETH appears to have declined notably, especially as Ether spot exchange‑traded funds (ETFs) recorded $129 million in net outflows between Wednesday and Friday. At present, there are no evident catalysts capable of decoupling Ether from the broader cryptocurrency market and driving its price above $3,800.

There is no imminent driver for a cryptocurrency rally, particularly as global trade war risks persist and concerns grow over the US job market outlook. Traders are increasingly reluctant to give the government the benefit of the doubt, as economic growth and inflation data may have been boosted by businesses and individuals stockpiling goods ahead of import tariff hikes.

Without renewed institutional inflows, ETH will likely continue moving closely with the overall altcoin market.

How Teen Mathematician Hannah Cairo Disproved a Major Mathematical Wave Conjecture

When she was just 17 years old, Hannah Cairo disproved the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture, breaking a four-decade-old mathematical assumption

By Emma R. Hasson edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

When Hannah Cairo was 17 years old, she disproved the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture, a long-standing guess in the field of harmonic analysis about how waves behave on curved surfaces. The conjecture was posed in the 1980s, and mathematicians had been trying to prove it ever since. If the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture turned out to be true, it would illuminate many other significant questions in the field. But after hitting wall after wall trying to prove it, Cairo managed to come up with a counterexample: a circumstance where the waves don't behave as predicted by the conjecture. Therefore, the conjecture can't be true.

Cairo got hooked on the problem after being assigned a simpler version of the conjecture to prove as a homework assignment for a class she was taking at the University of California, Berkeley. “It took me a while to convince [course instructor] Ruixiang Zhang that my proposal was actually correct,” she says. Now, under Zhang's advisement, she has a paper on the preprint server arXiv.org and was invited to present her results at the International Conference on Harmonic Analysis and Partial Differential Equations in El Escorial, Spain.

Cairo says she loves talking about her research and giving presentations with colorful and descriptive slides (see examples below). When asked what she studies, Cairo says, in short, “points, lines and waves.”

Born and raised in the Bahamas, Cairo moved to California at the age of 16, where she began to take classes at U.C. Berkeley. Now, at 18 years old, she is on to a Ph.D. program at the University of Maryland to continue her research in Fourier restriction theory. Cairo has faced many difficulties in her journey, but she has found comfort and belonging in the field of mathematics and in the work itself.

Scientific American spoke to Cairo about the way harmonic analysis is like dropping stones into a still pond, her transgender identity and the reasons she loves mathematics.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

Beyond “points, lines, and waves,” how would you explain your field of study, harmonic analysis?

Imagine that you're at a pond, and it's a very still pond, and you drop a stone into it. You see these circular waves spreading out. 

If you drop two stones in the pond, then you might notice this pattern called an interference pattern: instead of looking like circles, they overlap. You get high points, low points. And you get these interesting shapes [where they intersect]. What if you were to use a whole bunch of ripples—then what would you get? In harmonic analysis, you can actually prove that if you drop your stones in the right place in the pond, you can get any shape that you want.

Slide from Hannah Cairo's presentation on the Mizohata-Takeuchi Conjecture

Hannah Cairo

My specialty is known as Fourier restriction theory, which is the subdiscipline of harmonic analysis that I work in, where we ask what kind of objects can we build if we're only allowed to use certain kinds of waves. What if we're only allowed to drop the stones in certain parts of the pond? You won't be able to get just any object. In fact, you're only going to be able to get a relatively small family of objects. What the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture says is that the shape of the objects that we get are concentrated along lines.

What does it mean to be “concentrated along lines”?

One way to think of the shape of objects is to ask: What is curvature? There are a few different ways you can define it. One possible way is to take a thin, long rectangle and ask how much of your circle can lie in this thin rectangle. What you'll find is that not very much of it can because it bends away, right? On the other hand, if you take something flat like the edge of a square, then you can get a whole side of that square just on one thin tube. So that means that the square is not as “curved” as a circle. 

For the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture, we say, consider this object that we're building out of these waves. And we want to say that not very much is going to lie on shapes that do not contain very many lines or thin rectangles.

So how did you manage to disprove this conjecture?

I looked at these shapes, and one thing that I realized is that the specific kind of waves that are used are concentrated along thick rectangles. This is actually something that is well known. So you end up looking at these waves that are concentrated on rectangles: You take these waves, and they intersect each other, and they make these certain shapes, but here [instead of circle waves] we use rectangle waves. So then we have all of these rectangle waves meeting each other. What I realized is that the shape of where they meet is not quite at the right angle to agree with the direction that these rectangles are pointing in. And so this led me to a rather complicated construction using fractals to arrange these rectangles.

The original fractal construction doesn't actually show up in your paper though. What was your final counterexample?

What I found out is that if you arrange these waves by taking a high-dimensional hypercube and projecting it down into smaller-dimensional space and then taking only those waves that lie in your region, then this is how you can determine where to put them [to break the conjecture].

What first got you interested in math?

I've always been interested in math. I think that, for me, mathematics is an art. In my childhood, I was somewhat lonely. Math was sort of there as a friend almost. I think that art cannot necessarily be a friend in every way that a friend can be, but I think art is like a friend. And so, for as long as I can remember, I've always loved mathematics.

Tell me more about how math was a friend to you. I think a lot of people don't think of math as very friendly.

There's an analogy that I like to make, which is to another form of art: painting. And I think that if one were to take a class on paint, you could memorize the dates and times at which various forms of paint were developed—and maybe even which paints were used by which painters. And then you can figure out what processes you can use to determine what type of paint it is. I imagine this is useful in art history, but this is not art.... I shouldn't say that. Maybe there is an art to learning about paint. I'm not going to claim that there isn't because I don't study paint. But I think that math is a little bit like that—in school, people learn about [the mathematical version of] paint; they're not learning about painting.

Mathematics is comforting to me because it's a way of exploring—to explore ideas and to think about them and to build more ideas out of other ideas. What's comforting about that is that it's independent of the world in some ways. If I'm having a sad day, a happy day, if I move to Maryland (I did just move to Maryland), mathematics is still there, and it is still the same thing. It's also just something that can occupy my mind.

You've mentioned to me that you're transgender. How has that affected your journey?

I think that it's probably more relevant in my journey as a person than as a mathematician. Being trans has forced me to see things about the world that I maybe otherwise wouldn't have seen. It's made me see the world differently and made me see people differently and made me see myself differently.

Fortunately, in the math community, I think that most mathematicians are fine with trans people. I think that it used to be more significant [in my day to day] than it is now. These days it doesn't really make much of a difference.

Why have you decided to go on the record now as being trans?

Trans visibility is important. People have ideas about who trans people are, and I think that it's best to broaden that. Maybe I'm also hoping that people who think that trans people are “less” than cisgender people might find themselves questioning that.

The other thing is that it's good for trans people to know that they're not alone. I think that part of what helps trans people realize that they're trans is to know that there are more options for who you can be as a trans person. That's important to me.

Thank you so much for sharing that. Where is your favorite place to do math?

If I'm trying to be productive in writing something down, then I like to be at my desk, and I like to listen to Bach. If I am just trying to think about ideas, then my favorite place to do that is somewhere where I don't have to pay attention to very much else. I could just be sitting down somewhere thinking about stuff, or I could be going for a walk outside.

I also like to talk to other people about math, which is another kind of doing math. I really like to give presentations about mathematics. I have these handwritten slides with all these colors and drawings. Luckily, in harmonic analysis, I can give a presentation like this, and then everybody is so happy, and they tell me my slides are cute.

What's next for your research?

I'm working on a research project with my adviser on Mizohata-Takeuchi and adjacent stuff and about a sort of different thing: the local Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture. 

The process of learning more about this kind of mathematics is pretty exciting—not just for me learning more about what's out there but for the math community as a whole to try to understand these kinds of things better. [That's] something that I'm excited about.

That changes things.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In the subatomic universe of quantum physics, you can achieve things considered impossible in our flesh-and-blood physical world. Things like superposition, entanglement, and even teleportation all seem possible when things go quantum. Now, scientists from the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW) and University of Vienna are adding a kind of time travel to the list.

In a series of papers published on preprint servers and in various online journals (including Optica, arXiv, and Quantum), researchers including ÖAW's Miguel Navascués and University of Vienna's Philip Walther explain the possibility of speeding up, slowing down, and even reversing the flow of time within a quantum system. 

Navascués compares the phenomenon to different movie-watching experiences. “In a theater [classical physics], a movie is projected from beginning to end, regardless of what the audience wants,” he told the Spanish-language newspaper El País. “But at home [the quantum world], we have a remote control to manipulate the movie. We can rewind to a previous scene or skip several scenes ahead.”

The researchers achieved this by “evolving” a single photon as it passes through a crystal. Using an experimental device called a “quantum switch,” the single photon of light returns to its previous state before it ever makes the journey. In a way, this is less Doc Brown-style time travel and more about reverting or otherwise altering the states of quantum particles, or “time translation” as Navascués described in 2020.

However, this isn't exactly like a rewind button on your TV because usually, viewers can see how things got from plot point A to B—just sped up and in reverse. In quantum mechanics, however, simply observing a system causes it to change, which makes it impossible to track a system's progress through time. Crucially, these rewinding protocols still work because they can be performed without knowing what the changes were or its “internal dynamics,” according to the scientists.

And this quantum time machine doesn't just go one direction—Navascués said they've also hit upon a method for going forward in evolutionary time as well. He told El País:

Sadly, these sci-fi findings in the quantum world can't be sized up to send humans backward and forward in time, because a single human represents a mind-boggling amount of information to “rejuvenate”—in fact, the scientists estimate it would take millions of years to pull it off for just one second. 

But for the teams at ÖAW and the University of Vienna, the point isn't jetting off to the distant future, but the ability to increase the capability of quantum processors by arming them with the possibility of reversing errors in a system. After all, if life had a rewind button, wouldn't you use it?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","The Loch Ness Monster Literally Can't Look Like You Think, Scientists Say","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65570334/loch-ness-monster-shape/","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

It's just impossible. 

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

If there ever was anything such as a poster cryptid, it would have to be Nessie (sorry Bigfoot). The Loch Ness Monster of Scottish lore has often been depicted as a serpentine creature undulating vertically in the water. There is just one problem with these images—that kind of body cannot exist. 

Ancient texts going back to the sixth century A.D. describe sightings of a “watery beast” lurking in the depths of the loch. Since then, version of Nessie slithering in vertical arches has been on every possible souvenir, from shirts and hats to books, postcards, mugs, stuffed animals and just about everything else imaginable. If this is the Nessie that lives rent-free in most people's minds, sightings of what was thought to be the monster should match. It turned out that most witnesses saw something completely different. 

Despite the stereotype, most sighting reports of what could be Nessie are missing those iconic vertical loops. Even the infamous 1934 hoax, which had the masses believing Nessie was some sort of leftover plesiosaur from the late Cretaceous, showed only a long neck and part of her back. Almost everyone who could have sworn they saw a monster has given an account of something explicitly unlike the arched images. A 1933 report printed in The Inverness Courier described her body as “resembling that of a whale.” 

Later sightings continued to claim Nessie resembled a whale, complete with appendages that appeared to be fins. Others were unclear but described something huge in the water. After investigating stacks of blurry photos and other evidence, ecologist Charles Paxton of St. Andrews University and Adrian Shine of the Loch Ness Centre came to a conclusion about what Nessie must look like if she actually exists. So few reports of a thing with arches versus the plethora of images with them can only mean that pop culture has not influenced ideas of what eyewitnesses at least thought they saw. 

“This insight supports the contention that the majority of eyewitness reports are actually based on some underlying physical reality, even if not representing an actual encounter with an unknown species,” Paxton and Shine said in a study recently published in Endeavour.

Nothing extant or extinct is known to have Nessie's imagined body, which features what the researchers call “vertical flexations so extreme as to show arches.” Were her pop-culturally accepted form be correct, it would actually impede the ability to swim. They instead think that vertical arches surfaced from a way to show that the creature slithered through the water even if the depiction wasn't literal. Sea snakes, eels and most fish undulate from side to side. Marine mammals such as whales have flexible spines that allow them to swim with vertical undulations, surfacing briefly and revealing their backs, and then plunge into the deep again. It might seem like a vertical undulation above water from a distance.

While no DNA of actual sea snakes, whales, plesiosaurs and many other suspected Nessies has ever been found in Loch Ness, mental comparisons to known animals such as these may consider the way these animals briefly appear above water and the curvature of their bodies. This may also have contributed to the arched version of the cryptid in question and other alleged swimming monsters. Some sightings turned out to be nothing more than logs or boat debris, and it is plausible that multiple scraps of floating junk could give an arched impression.

Paxton argues that claims of anything with multiple arches swimming in the loch is less likely to be Nessie—if she exists—than something matching the description of Nessie from most eyewitness accounts. She would have to look like what the overwhelming majority has described over the last century. Meanwhile, the search continues.

Metabolic reprogramming is a well-established hallmark of macrophage activation, coordinating bioenergetic and biosynthetic pathways to support immune effector functions. A new study now reveals a previously unappreciated, system-wide remodelling of nucleotide metabolism driven by nitric oxide (NO), with important implications for inflammatory macrophage function and host–pathogen interactions.

Nature Human Behaviour

                         (2025)Cite this article


Scientific publishing is the primary means of disseminating research findings. There has been speculation about how extensively large language models (LLMs) are being used in academic writing. Here we conduct a systematic analysis across 1,121,912 preprints and published papers from January 2020 to September 2024 on arXiv, bioRxiv and Nature portfolio journals, using a population-level framework based on word frequency shifts to estimate the prevalence of LLM-modified content over time. Our findings suggest a steady increase in LLM usage, with the largest and fastest growth estimated for computer science papers (up to 22%). By comparison, mathematics papers and the Nature portfolio showed lower evidence of LLM modification (up to 9%). LLM modification estimates were higher among papers from first authors who post preprints more frequently, papers in more crowded research areas and papers of shorter lengths. Our findings suggest that LLMs are being broadly used in scientific writing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","AMD Threadripper: The Uncompromising King of CPUs","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/threadripper-the-uncompromising-king-of-cpus-179853.html","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 12:01:55 GMT","

Last week, AMD dropped the Threadripper 9000 series, and it is amazing, starting with its name. In the world of technology, product names often range from the blandly numerical to the abstractly corporate. Then, there is “Threadripper.” It's a name that is so perfectly aggressive, so evocative of raw power, that it couldn't possibly belong to anything other than a CPU designed for absolute dominance.

The name doesn't suggest it will simply process your tasks; it promises to tear through them with violent efficiency. It's a name that stands alone, a declaration of intent in a market crowded with Core, Xeon, and Ryzen.

This time, the branding isn't hyperbole. The story of Threadripper is the story of a product that has consistently lived up to its audacious name, fundamentally reshaping the landscape of high-performance computing with each new release.

Let's dig into why Threadripper lives up to its name. Then, we'll close with my Product of the Week, which should have been Threadripper, but that would be a bit of overkill, so I'm highlighting the Corsair 4000D modular PC case that I used to build my Threadripper system.

To appreciate the latest Threadripper processors, one must understand their improbable origin. In the mid-2010s, the high-end desktop (HEDT) market was a stagnant pond, with core counts inching forward incrementally. The conventional wisdom was that the insatiable demand for more cores was limited to the server room.

Astonishingly, the Threadripper project didn't begin in a boardroom as part of a grand strategic plan. Instead, it was born from a small, passionate team of engineers at AMD who, in their spare time, saw an opportunity to fuse the architecture of their server-grade EPYC processors with the high clock speeds of their consumer Ryzen chips.

It was a massive gamble. They were creating a premium, high-core-count processor for a market that, according to many analysts, was niche to the point of being non-existent. The initial reception from the market, however, was not one of confusion, but of ravenous enthusiasm. Professionals, prosumers, and hardcore enthusiasts who had been starving for more multi-threaded performance suddenly had a champion.

In 2017, the first 16-core Threadripper 1950X was a shock to the system, offering a level of parallel processing power previously reserved for exorbitantly priced server hardware. It proved AMD could build high-core-count CPUs that could rival the best in the world, and it was just the beginning.

While enthusiasts were quick to embrace Threadripper, its ascension to the professional throne was cemented by a bold strategic partnership. Lenovo, a giant in the PC space but not the traditional leader in high-end workstations, saw the immense potential of what AMD had created.

Unlike competitors that remained entrenched with their existing partners, Lenovo made a decisive move, becoming the first major OEM to build a workstation specifically around the professional-grade version of the chip.

The result was the Lenovo ThinkStation P620, the world's first AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO workstation. This single-socket machine could be configured with up to 64 cores, offering performance that rivaled and often surpassed dual-socket systems from competitors, but in a more power-efficient and cost-effective package.

The move was a masterstroke. According to Techspective, this product allowed Lenovo to capture a 60% market share at the top end of the professional workstation market, a segment historically dominated by Dell and HP. It was a testament to both AMD's engineering prowess and Lenovo's strategic foresight, proving that a single, exceptionally powerful CPU could redefine an entire industry segment.

So, what makes a Threadripper so powerful? It's a symphony of cutting-edge technologies working in concert. The latest AMD Ryzen Threadripper 7000 and PRO 7000 WX-Series processors, built on the advanced “Zen 4” architecture, are the current flag bearers, with the upcoming 9000 series promising even more. These chips boast specifications that read like a fantasy wish list for a power user.

First, the core counts are staggering. With the P series scaling up to 96 cores and 192 threads in a single CPU, these processors can handle a colossal number of tasks simultaneously. For 3D artists rendering complex scenes, data scientists training AI models, or filmmakers editing 8K video, this means waiting times are slashed from hours to minutes.

However, it's not just about the number of cores. The Zen architecture provides a high number of instructions per clock (IPC), and with boost clocks reaching well over 5.0 GHz, Threadripper excels at both multi-threaded and single-threaded workloads.

Furthermore, the platform itself is built for bandwidth. The PRO models feature an eight-channel memory controller for DDR5 RAM, providing a massive pipeline for data to feed the hungry cores. They also boast an incredible number of PCIe 5.0 lanes — up to 128 on the PRO platform — allowing for configurations with multiple high-end GPUs, ultra-fast NVMe storage arrays, and high-speed networking cards without creating a single bottleneck. It is a platform designed without compromise, for workflows that cannot afford them.

A Threadripper-based system is not for checking email or browsing the web. It is a tool for the most demanding professionals and creators. The price of entry is high, but the value proposition lies in its longevity. In the fast-paced world of technology, “futureproofing” is often a fool's errand, but a Threadripper system comes closer than anything else.

The sheer performance overhead means that a workstation built today will remain capable for years to come. As software becomes more complex and multi-threaded, a system with 64 or 96 cores will only become more valuable. The expansive PCIe and memory support ensure that you can adopt the next generation of GPUs or storage technology without needing to replace the entire platform — making a Threadripper workstation a long-term investment rather than a short-term expense.

While the HEDT space has historically seen frequent socket changes, AMD has provided a degree of stability with its sTR5 socket, supporting multiple generations of processors and giving users a clear upgrade path.

From its origins as a rebellious passion project to its current status as the undisputed king of high-end desktop and workstation computing, Threadripper has carved out a unique and iconic legacy.

Its name is a mission statement — a promise of performance so extreme it rips through the very threads of a computational task. Through bold engineering and strategic partnerships, like the one with Lenovo that redefined the workstation market, AMD made more than just a fast processor. They created a new class of computing, empowering creators, scientists, and engineers to push the boundaries of what's possible.

The latest releases continue this tradition, offering a level of power that feels less like an incremental upgrade and more like a generational leap. For those who need the absolute best, who see time as their most valuable asset, and who demand a system that will not flinch at any task thrown at it, there is still only one name that truly matters: Threadripper.

After decades of building PCs — averaging around two systems a quarter — I've seen my fair share of frustrating, knuckle-scraping case designs. So, when a chassis comes along that not only looks fantastic but is an absolute joy to build in, it deserves special recognition.

This week's top product is, without a doubt, the Corsair Frame 4000D modular mid-tower PC case. As I gear up for my summer projects, this case is the foundation for one of the three high-performance systems I'm building, and it has already proven to be a godsend for any serious builder.

Currently priced at $104.99, the first thing you notice about the Frame 4000D is its impeccable design. It boasts clean, minimalist lines and a build quality that feels substantial and premium — but its true genius is revealed once you start the build. For a powerful system like the Threadripper build that this case is destined for, cooling is paramount. The Frame 4000D offers robust support for dual 360mm radiators, providing the thermal headroom needed for top-tier components.

What truly sets it apart for me is the innovative InfiniRail fan mounting system. This feature replaces fixed mounting points with adjustable rails, allowing you to slide your fans and radiators into the perfect position. This small change eliminates the usual hassle of aligning screw holes and makes installation remarkably easy.

Corsair's attention to detail extends to managing the behemoth GPUs that power modern workstations and gaming rigs. The Frame 4000D includes a sturdy, built-in GPU stabilizer arm, a rare but incredibly welcome feature that prevents GPU sag and protects your motherboard's PCIe slot from stress.

Its cable management is a dream. A built-in shroud elegantly hides the power supply and a mess of cables, while ample tie-down points and routing channels make achieving a clean, professional-looking interior effortless.

For builders who value both aesthetics and a frustration-free experience, the Corsair Frame 4000D is a masterpiece. It addresses the common pain points of PC building while providing the space and features needed for a high-end, powerful system. It has more than earned its spot as my Product of the Week.

Seattle-based LevelTen Energy, a startup facilitating the deployment of clean energy projects, is laying off 60 workers according to a new Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) released by the Washington state Employment Security Department.

The layoffs take effect beginning Aug. 15, according to the filing. We've reached out to the company for more details.

LevelTen describes itself as the world's largest online marketplace connecting buyers, sellers, advisors and financiers of clean energy projects. Its customers include tech companies and other businesses and institutions looking to support renewable power in order to curb their climate emissions. The company's platform has been used for transactions totaling more than $14.8 billion.

Clean energy deployments have been on the rise for many years, but Republican leaders in July passed their mega bill, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill, which cuts tax incentives for renewable wind and solar power passed during the Biden administration. Those breaks are scuttled in 2028, at which point new installations of onshore wind and solar in the U.S. are expected to plunge 41%, according to BloombergNEF.

The headwinds come just a year after LevelTen raised a $65 million Series D round that included investments from Microsoft and Google, among others.

As of last summer, the company had 130 employees and an optimistic outlook.

“We see a massive opportunity to bring our transaction infrastructure to new, really important adjacent climate technologies and to expand geographically and to add some new customer types to the platform,” LevelTen CEO and founder Bryce Smith told GeekWire in July 2024. 

The new funding was meant to help the company spread beyond the 29 countries in North America and Europe in which it was already operating. 

But some deals are still being made. In June, the company announced a new clean energy project that it facilitated with Starbucks and the software company Workday to support the construction of a 350 megawatt solar power installation in Central Texas.

Rob Collier, LevelTen's senior vice president of marketplaces, said that demand for the projects remained high.

“Demand is booming right now for energy, for electricity, for power, particularly clean electrons,” Collier told GeekWire in June. “And that's driven by a number of pretty strong macroeconomic forcing functions: the need for data centers, and the increased demand due to AI.”

But he did acknowledge that the sector was not attracting new customers for power purchase agreements and that the supply side was getting more difficult, with ongoing challenges with permitting and electrical grid connections, as well as persistent uncertainty around policy and tariffs making it hard to plan and deploy the infrastructure.

LevelTen launched in 2016 and has raised $125 million to date.

Google's AI-powered bug hunter has just reported its first batch of security vulnerabilities. 

Heather Adkins, Google's vice president of security, announced Monday that its LLM-based vulnerability researcher Big Sleep found and reported 20 flaws in various popular open source software.

Adkins said that Big Sleep, which is developed by the company's AI department DeepMind as well as its elite team of hackers Project Zero, reported its first-ever vulnerabilities, mostly in open source software such as audio and video library FFmpeg and image-editing suite ImageMagick. 

Given that the vulnerabilities are not fixed yet, we don't have details of their impact or severity, as Google does not yet want to provide details, which is a standard policy when waiting for bugs to be fixed. But the simple fact that Big Sleep found these vulnerabilities is significant, as it shows these tools are starting to get real results, even if there was a human involved in this case. 

“To ensure high quality and actionable reports, we have a human expert in the loop before reporting, but each vulnerability was found and reproduced by the AI agent without human intervention,” Google's spokesperson Kimberly Samra told TechCrunch. 

Royal Hansen, Google's vice president of engineering, wrote on X that the findings demonstrate “a new frontier in automated vulnerability discovery.” 

LLM-powered tools that can look for and find vulnerabilities are already a reality. Other than Big Sleep, there's RunSybil and XBOW, among others. 

XBOW has garnered headlines after it reached the top of one of the U.S. leaderboards at bug bounty platform HackerOne. It's important to note that in most cases, these reports have a human at some point of the process to verify that the AI-powered bug hunter found a legitimate vulnerability, as is the case with Big Sleep.

Vlad Ionescu, co-founder and chief technology officer at RunSybil, a startup that develops AI-powered bug hunters, told TechCrunch that Big Sleep is a “legit” project, given that it has “good design, people behind it know what they're doing, Project Zero has the bug finding experience and DeepMind has the firepower and tokens to throw at it.”

There is obviously a lot of promise with these tools, but also significant downsides. Several people who maintain different software projects have complained of bug reports that are actually hallucinations, with some calling them the bug bounty equivalent of AI slop. 

“That's the problem people are running into, is we're getting a lot of stuff that looks like gold, but it's actually just crap,” Ionescu previously told TechCrunch.

Rivian has filed a lawsuit in Ohio to be able to sell its electric vehicles directly to consumers in the state — the latest swing in a perpetual fight between up-and-coming American automakers and the entrenched and powerful dealership lobby.

The company sued the registrar of Ohio's Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) on Monday in federal court, claiming the state is harming consumers by blocking direct sales. Rivian is currently able to sell EVs directly to consumers in 25 states and in Washington, D.C. 

Ohio's BMV did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“Ohio's prohibition of Rivian's direct-sales-only business model is irrational in the extreme: it reduces competition, decreases consumer choice, and drives up consumer costs and inconvenience — all of which harm consumers — with literally no countervailing benefit,” lawyers for the company wrote in the complaint.

Rivian is asking the court to allow the company to apply for a dealership license so it can sell vehicles directly. Ohio customers have to buy from Rivian vehicles from locations in other states where direct sales are allowed. The cars are then shipped to Rivian service centers within Ohio.

Allowing Rivian to sell directly would not be treading new legal ground, the company argues in its complaint. Tesla has had a license to sell in Ohio since 2013 and can sell directly to consumers.

What's stopping Rivian is a 2014 law passed by the state's legislature. That law, which Rivian says came after an intense lobbying effort by the Ohio Automobile Dealers Association (OADA), effectively gave Tesla a carve-out and blocked any future manufacturers from acquiring the necessary dealership licenses. (The OADA did not immediately return a request for comment.)

“Consumer choice is a bedrock principle of America's economy. Ohio's archaic prohibition against the direct-sales of vehicles is unconstitutional, irrational, and harms Ohioans by reducing competition and choice and driving up costs and inconvenience,” Mike Callahan, Rivian's chief administrative officer, said in a statement.

Rivian has won legal fights over direct sales before. In 2021, Rivian and Lucid Motors were granted dealership licenses to sell EVs in Illinois. That state's dealer association sued to try to block Rivian and Lucid from selling directly but ultimately failed.

Lucid Motors, meanwhile, filed a lawsuit of its own in Texas in 2022 in a challenge to that state's direct-sales ban. The court ruled against Lucid earlier this year, but the company has appealed, federal court records show.

In particular, I'm curious about libtmux/tmuxp and how well it works to have a more declarative bringup than just a bash script launching things into the background and then attaching tmux windows to them.And I guess the broader question of whether this approach is an evolutionary dead end— like does it just become a pile of hacks as one discovers the need for restart policies, backoffs, ordering, whatever other stuff that is built into a ""normal"" process manager like systemd or runit? If you do end up wanting to send process stdout/stderr elsewhere or do alerting, is that now annoying if those streams are ""trapped"" in tmux sessions vs being written into log files or the journal?

Tmux is more customisable, but a lot messier out the box. It's much older so has picked up a little cruft along the way.Zellij is newer so has the benefit of being a clearer implementation. But it's designed as an ""out the bix"" experience, not one you can customise to your hearts content.Edit: if you did want to try out zellij, I should point out there's a ""no install, try in shell"" option on their website's main page which is a super quick way to get a taste!

I have started using nvim about a year ago, and that one also took three separate tries before it finally stuck with me :) After that, about 8 months ago I found tmux and had a harsh ""first impression"".These days I enjoy using both of those tools and get more excited the more I learn about them.

The only reason to still use tmux (or screen) is because you use remote sessions. All modern terminal emulators are already capable of doing tabs and panes (okay, maybe not sessions, but some can locally). If you're using tmux for this reason, stop. Go pick up a modern terminal like ghostty, Alacritty, or WezTerm.But why tmux still exists today is because people are working on computers they aren't sitting in front of. Because I don't want to have to be running nohup or detaching, moving to the background, and resetting the session so error messages don't appear in my active instance. Hell, technically I can do this with vim and get something pretty similar to tmux by using the terminal. But that's a pain.Tmux is for *terminals*

So, even when nested, it's always clear what will happen. One nested session (two total) is manageable. Adding another gets annoying, but the need is rare.

Do you think it's possible that someone might have a different workflow from you and tmux fits their use case in a way you haven't thought of?

reply

That said, I still use tmux. Almost every day in fact. Because all my work is being done on a machine I'm not sitting in front of. This even includes at home. My main desktop is connected to a TV for videogames and movies. When I want to do work on it there's no difference if I'm sitting in front of my laptop or it other than it sitting in my livingroom keeps it cooler and gives it better air flow.

Like you mention, tmux sessions was one of the biggest features that I enjoyed about this tool: it does the job and does it well. Aside from that I love that I can use Vim-bindings with it, that it feels very similar to Neovim for me, so using them together is a no-brainer. Learning a couple of specific keyboard shortcuts is all it takes to make me productive.I haven't needed to use a remote session yet like you note. While working with tmux locally I have learnt about all of these other features that I will definitely be looking forward to using once the opportunity arises.I don't doubt that tools like ghostty, Alacritty, or WezTerm are great. I have heard lots about the first two. And I do intend to check them out.What would you say is your favorite terminal and why as it relates to local development experience use? Are there features that these tools have that tmux lacks?

Amazon is reportedly laying off more than 100 employees as it overhauls its podcast business amid major shifts in the industry.

Bloomberg first reported on Monday that Amazon is laying off about 110 staff from its Wondery podcast studio and shifting some shows to Audible, its other audio-focused subsidiary. As part of the shake-up, Wondery CEO Jen Sargent is leaving the company.

The reorganization comes as the podcast industry faces its own “video killed the radio star” moment, with creator-led, video-based shows surging in popularity and thus being more monetizable.

The e-commerce giant sent Gizmodo the following statement about the changes:

The podcast landscape has evolved significantly in the past few years, particularly with the rise of video-forward, creator-led content. These changes reflect that evolution and will streamline how Wondery integrates further into Amazon. By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels, help them expand their brand IP, and simplify the process for advertisers while making content more accessible to audiences wherever they prefer to consume it. This evolution builds on Wondery's early success with video-forward shows and positions us to better serve creators, customers, and advertisers.

In a memo to staff obtained by Deadline, Steve Boom, Amazon's vice president of audio, Twitch, and games, said the rise of video podcasting has created “different audience needs” and requires “distinct discovery, growth, and monetization strategies” compared to traditional audio-only narrative podcasts.

In the letter, Boom said that Amazon is reorganizing Wondery with its narrative podcasts like Dr. Death and Business Wars moving to Audible. The studio's chief content officer, Marshall Lewy, will also be headed to Audible.

For Wondery's creator-led shows like Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert and Jason and Travis Kelce's New Heights, a new Creator Services team under Amazon's Talent Services division will be taking over. This team will continue operating the creator-focused podcast studio under the Wondery brand, working closely with a select group of top creators to expand their audiences and deepen their partnership with Amazon.

Bloomberg highlighted LeBron James, who hosts the podcast Mind the Game and has served as a Prime Day spokesperson, as a blueprint for this new approach.

Amazon originally acquired Wondery in 2021 for about $300 million, according to media reports. At its peak, the studio saw some of its hit podcasts like Dirty John adapted into TV shows.

But Amazon isn't the only company that has poured big money into podcasting. Last year, Spotify reportedly signed a $250 million deal to continue managing sponsorships for Joe Rogan's podcast. Meanwhile, SiriusXM paid $125 million to poach Alex Cooper's Call Her Daddy podcast from Spotify.

As competition has increased in the industry, there have already been some losers too. In June, Audacy, the radio giant owned by a group led by Soros Fund Management, shut down its podcast-focused Pineapple Street Studios.

Public media is also facing challenges. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which helps fund National Public Radio (NPR), a pioneer in podcasting, is set to wind down operations and lay off most of its staff by September 30. This move comes as President Donald Trump has cut the nonprofit's funding.

Columbo, eat your heart out: A team of scientists has just solved a massive marine murder mystery, nabbing the culprit behind the deaths of billions of sea stars over the past decade.

In a new study, researchers in the U.S. and Canada argue that the bacterial cousin of cholera is behind the epidemic. Through a series of experiments involving both wild and captive sea stars, they found evidence that Vibrio pectenicida is the likely cause of sea star wasting disease—a devastating condition that causes the invertebrates to decay and essentially “melt.”

The team's findings appear to be well supported with evidence, Zak Swartz, a biologist specializing in sea stars at the Marine Biological Laboratory who was not involved with the study, told Gizmodo.

“This study definitely passes the sniff test for me. It seems quite convincing that V. pectenicida bacteria are at least one causative agent of SSWS,” Swartz said.

Sea stars started disappearing in 2013, when a massive outbreak of SSWD struck the North American Pacific coast. The disease swept the seas from Alaska to Mexico, decimating more than 20 different species of sea stars, which are also known as starfish. Afflicted creatures first develop visible lesions on their skin, and then their tissue starts to decay. Death by SSWD is often swift, killing the sea star within days.

There have been other mass sea star die-offs in recent decades, but the sheer scale and spread of this outbreak makes it possibly the largest marine disease epidemic ever recorded in the wild. Researchers estimate that one particular sea star species, Pycnopodia helianthoides, has lost 90% of its population to SSWD. The destruction has also dramatically changed the environments where the sea stars once thrived. In the aftermath of SSWD outbreaks, some areas have also lost kelp forests, as sea urchins—once kept in check by sea stars—decimated the underwater forests.

Marine scientists have been looking for the cause of SSWD ever since its emergence. And like any great mystery, there have been some twists. In 2014, a research team published a paper that argued a sea star-associated densovirus caused SSWD. But subsequent studies showed that this virus—or any potentially pathogenic virus for that matter—could only be found in a minority of affected species, ruling it out as the likeliest suspect.

Swartz noted that some Vibrio bacteria, however, were already known to cause disease in echinoderms—the broad group of marine invertebrates that includes sea stars. “So in a sense, it feels like the answer was hiding right under our noses. It makes total sense,” he said. Several species of Vibrio can also sicken humans, including cholera (Vibrio cholerae). 

The researchers didn't set out on this study with V. pectenicida in mind from the get-go. They exhaustively studied samples of sea stars with SSWD and healthy specimens, eventually finding that only the diseased sea stars carried high levels of the bacteria in their coelomic fluid (the invertebrate version of blood). The researchers were then able to isolate and grow new populations of the bacteria collected from the sick sea stars. And when they exposed healthy sea stars to these bacteria, the creatures rapidly developed and died from SSWD.

These experiments are the same sort used to identify and conclusively show a particular germ causes a specific disease in humans, strengthening the team's case. Further analysis also revealed that SSWD is caused by a specific strain of the bacteria, called FHCF-3.

“Here we use controlled exposure experiments, genetic datasets, and field observations to demonstrate that the bacterium, Vibrio pectenicida strain FHCF-3, is a causative agent of SSWD,” the authors wrote in their paper, published Monday in Nature Ecology and Evolution.

Though the mystery of what causes SSWD appears solved, Swartz and the study authors note that there are still several important unanswered questions. For example, scientists aren't sure exactly how the outbreaks start. It's possible the bacteria could spread via sea stars' shared food, or through physical contact with other sea stars. Low levels of the bacteria may also always be circulating in the environment, but only become a major problem under specific conditions, like at a certain temperature (Vibrio bacteria in general thrive in warmer water).

Still, given that SSWD remains a threat to sea stars, simply knowing its cause could boost sea star recovery efforts, the researchers said. It might be possible to find genetic mutations that help sea stars fend off these infections, for instance, enabling scientists to breed sea stars carrying these mutations in captivity with the aim of reintroducing them into the wild to bolster the population's resilience.

A new RX 9000-series graphics card for prebuilts, not builders 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


In a press release obtained by Tom's Hardware today, AMD announced the Radeon RX 9060, a new entry-level GPU that is said to be optimized for 1080p gaming. Notably, the new graphics card will not be available for purchase through retail channels, but will only be available with PCs offered by ""select system integrators.""

AMD hasn't shared the full specifications of the RX 9060 yet, but it will be based on the same RDNA 4 architecture shared by the RX 9070 XT and the RX 9060 XT. This GPU has 28 RDNA 4 compute units, down from 32 on the RX 9060 XT.

Assuming clocks similar to those of the RX 9060 XT, the RX 9060 could deliver up to 22.43 TFLOPS of shader power, down about 12.5% from the RX 9060 XT. It will feature 8GB of GDDR6 memory running at as-yet-undisclosed speeds and will offer support for FSR 4 upscaling.

AMD's decision to make the RX 9060 available only through system integrators (i.e., in prebuilt systems) seems like an unfortunate one. Even with only 8GB of VRAM, this product could have been an appealing upgrade for system builders on tight budgets.

RX 9060 XT 8GB cards are currently available for about $250 to $300, depending on the retailer, and an even cheaper RDNA 4 card could have been compelling. Without an official MSRP, however, we have only a limited idea of how the RX 9060 would have been positioned in the Radeon RX 9000-series product family.

AMD also plans to release a new Adrenalin driver update for its range of GPUs that expands support for a handful of newly released games. Driver version 25.8.1 will soon be available for download and offers optimized gameplay in Mafia: The Old Country, Mecha Break, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and the newly updated Unreal Engine 5 release of Valorant. The latest release is also said to offer support for the upcoming Battlefield 6 open beta, which is expected to roll out later this week.

While AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4) is officially supported by a limited number of games, the latest update also expands support for the upscaling tech to more titles. These include Cyberpunk 2077, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Mafia: The Old Country, Arena Breakout: Infinite, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, Wreckfest 2, and Lies of P.

The limited availability of FSR 4 stands in stark contrast to Nvidia's latest DLSS 4 upscaling, which is currently supported in over 125 games and applications. While AMD is clearly working on expanding FSR 4 support, the technology is restricted to the company's latest Radeon RX 9000 series graphics cards, which further limits its reach. Still, it's good to see the technology come to more titles.

A new Ryzen 9000X3D flagship could be in the works.

AMD already sells some of the best CPUs on the retail market. However, hardware leaker chi11eddog claims that the chipmaker might capitalize on the success of the Ryzen 9000X3D series and introduce two more models to the already diverse family.

The new processors will continue to utilize the Granite Ridge silicon with Zen 5 execution cores. One of the two rumored models will reportedly have 16 cores with simultaneous multithreading (SMT), a configuration similar to the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and the regular Ryzen 9 9950X. However, the most surprising feature resides in the L3 cache. According to the leaker, the 16-core X3D part will reportedly employ a dual CCD (Core Complex Die) configuration. While AMD has previously released Ryzen chips with dual CCDs, the chipmaker has never slapped 3D V-Cache on both CCDs.

As a quick refresher, each CCD is equipped with 32MB of L3 cache and 64MB of 3D V-Cache, totaling 96MB of total L3 cache per CCD. Consequently, a chip featuring two CCDs would logically increase the maximum L3 cache to 192MB, which is 50% more than the amount found in the Ryzen 9 9950X3D. Although we have encountered 192MB of L3 cache as far back as AMD's EPYC 7002 (codenamed Rome) processors from the Zen 2 era, it remains an unprecedented feat for a consumer processor to possess such a substantial amount of L3 cache.

Apparently, the Ryzen 9000X3D SKU with 3D V-Cache on both CCDs could have a 200W TDP. This is because the additional 3D V-Cache on the other CCD consumes more power, which explains the higher TDP. For now, we don't have an idea whether the clock speeds will be the same or higher. Compared to the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, the upcoming SKU could consume 18% more power.

*Specifications are unconfirmed.

The second rumored processor allegedly boasts eight cores, sixteen threads, and a 96MB L3 cache. The leaker suggests that it's a 120W processor. These specifications are reminiscent of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which shares similar characteristics. Notably, the leaker did not disclose the clock speeds. However, the new SKU will probably be a lower-clocked variant of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, possibly a Ryzen 7 9700X3D or a similar model.

Ryzen processors with a single CCD generally offer better gaming performance compared to those with two CCDs. This applies to the Ryzen X3D variant as well since the 3D V-Cache is only present on one of them. The disadvantage of dual CCDs is the introduction of latency, which negatively impacts performance because data has to travel across the CCDs instead of a single CCD. Consequently, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D outperforms the Ryzen 9 9950X3D. It would be intriguing to assess how having 3D V-Cache on both CCDs could enhance performance and possibly reduce latency.

The technology was always there. AMD could easily integrate 3D V-Cache into any number of CCDs it desired. It wasn't a question of whether AMD could or couldn't do it; it was a matter of whether the chipmaker wanted to do it. Logically, producing a single CCD Ryzen 9000X3D is already expensive, so adding the L3 SRAM to both CCDs would make it even more costly. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D, which has a $699 MSRP, is already selling for $669. Introducing a new 16-core SKU with 192MB L3 cache will bring the MSRP closer to Ryzen Threadripper levels. AMD already has the ultimate gaming champion in the Ryzen 7 9800X3D and a productivity powerhouse in the Ryzen 9 9950X3D. So, AMD releasing an even higher-end part may be more about spurring sales of its platform rather than a need to stay ahead of its CPU competition.

The Intel Arrow Lake showdown. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


At first glance, pitting the Intel Core Ultra 7 265K vs Core Ultra 9 285 might seem like a foregone conclusion. After all, the $580 Core 9 285K carries a significantly higher price tag and is positioned as Intel's top-tier offering in the Arrow Lake lineup, while the $290 Core 7 265K sits a rung below with a more modest price tag.

It's easy to assume the more expensive CPU will simply outperform across the board. However, this comparison goes beyond raw performance numbers and pricing alone. With Intel recently slashing the 265K's price by a substantial $100, the value proposition has shifted dramatically, raising important questions about which CPU truly makes more sense for different types of users and workloads.

Intel positions the Core Ultra 9 285K as its undisputed desktop champion, the apex predator designed for those who demand absolute, uncompromised performance. Sitting just below it, the Core Ultra 7 265K represents the savvy enthusiast's choice — a processor packing a massive amount of cutting-edge technology and core muscle, often delivering near-flagship experience, but crucially, now at a dramatically reduced price point.

We put these two Arrow Lake chips through a six-round gauntlet to determine if the 265K can hold its own, or if the 285K's premium status truly justifies its cost.

The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K and Core Ultra 7 265K both belong to Intel's latest Arrow Lake-S desktop processor family, with the compute cores built on TSMC's N3B (3nm) fabrication process. Architecturally, they share the same underlying hybrid core design featuring a combination of high-performance “Lion Cove” P-cores and efficient “Skymont” E-cores, as well as identical support for DDR5-6400 CUDIMM memory (DDR5-5600 for standard UDIMMs) and PCIe 5.0 connectivity.

Both processors use the new FCLGA1851 socket and are compatible with the same 800-series chipset motherboards. This common foundation means they benefit from the same modern features, such as unlocked multipliers for overclocking and integrated Intel Arc-Xe graphics with 64 execution units.

The primary difference lies in their core counts and thread configurations. The Core Ultra 9 285K boasts a total of 24 cores with 8 P-cores and 16 E-cores, yielding 24 threads. Meanwhile, the 265K offers 20 cores with 8 P-cores and 12 E-cores, totaling 20 threads. This difference in efficiency cores gives the 285K an advantage in heavily threaded workloads and multitasking scenarios.

The processors have different base and boost clock speeds, with the 285K running at 3.7 GHz base and 5.7 GHz boost on P-cores, and the 265K with a slightly higher 3.9 GHz base but a lower 5.4 GHz boost. The E-cores on both chips have a 4.6 GHz boost.

Cache sizes are also different between these two models. The 285K comes equipped with a larger shared L3 cache of 36 MB compared to the 30 MB on the 265K. This expanded cache on the 285K supports better data throughput and reduced latency, which can enhance performance in cache-sensitive applications such as gaming and content creation.

In terms of power consumption, both processors have a base TDP of 125 watts and a maximum turbo power rating of 250 watts, indicating similar thermal and power envelopes despite the 285K's higher core count. However, the 285K, being the flagship CPU that it is, also has a PL2 “Extreme” power rating of 295 watts that can be accessed under certain conditions. Of course, this difference directly translates to thermal output and cooling concerns as well.

Additionally, Intel has the Core Ultra 7 265KF without integrated graphics (denoted by the 'F') as an option. F-series chips are usually sold at a discount due to the disabled iGPU, but Intel's recent price adjustment has left the 265KF variant selling for more than its fully-equipped sibling, scuttling the value play we usually get with these. As such, you should ignore the KF variant. The 285K doesn't have an F-series option.

Looking at the spec sheet alone, the Core Ultra 9 285K offers a more robust core and cache configuration aimed at users demanding maximum multi-threaded performance, while the Core Ultra 7 265K provides a slightly higher base clock and an identical number of performance cores. Both processors have modern features and efficient power management, but the 285K targets enthusiasts and professional workloads that can leverage its additional cores and cache.

⭐ Winner: Intel Core Ultra 9 285K

Intel's flagship wins out quite cleanly in this round due to its superior core counts, boost clocks, and larger L3 cache capacity.

While our in-depth reviews provide a more comprehensive analysis, this section will focus on a gaming performance overview. The benchmark graphs display average FPS and 1% lows for various games at 1080p, designed to maximize the observable difference between these CPUs. Using a high-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 ensures GPU limitations are removed, making this setup ideal for comparing pure CPU performance.

According to our benchmark results, the Core Ultra 7 265K and Core Ultra 9 285K exhibit a consistent but relatively narrow performance gap across gaming benchmarks at 1080p. In the 16-game geomean using High/Ultra settings, the 285K delivers an average FPS of 144.9, compared to the 265K's 138.8 FPS - a difference of approximately a mere 4.4%.

The gap in 1% low performance is similarly modest, with the 285K achieving 107 FPS against the 265K's 103 FPS (a 4% advantage). This indicates that while the 285K is consistently faster, the uplift is marginal and stems primarily from its higher power budget and potentially slightly elevated clock speeds within the same core architecture.

Our gaming performance benchmarks clearly show that for gaming, the 285K's $580 price tag, double that of the $290 Core 7 265K, is a bad choice for gamers on the hunt for a value-focused gaming rig. Even if you're chasing the highest possible frame rates, the 285K offers precious little for twice the cost.

Drilling into specific titles reveals further nuances. In Baldur's Gate 3, the 285K averages a 5% lead against the 265K, leveraging its clock speed edge in this single-threaded-heavy RPG. Cyberpunk 2077 showed a more modest gap, with the 285K coming out 2.7% ahead of the 265K, reflecting its superior multi-threaded performance in this CPU-intensive open-world title, driven by more E-cores and higher clocks handling AI and physics.

Additionally, in Minecraft RT, the difference was minimal. The 3.8% average and 3.4% lead in 1% low numbers suggest ray tracing's mixed CPU-GPU demands lessen the 285K's edge, with its extra resources offering marginal gains in geometry processing.

The difference in 1% low performance is arguably more critical for perceived smoothness than average FPS. Across the tested suite, the 285K consistently delivers slightly higher minimums, as seen in the 16-game Geomean gap of 4%. However, the difference is not as substantial as one would expect. As an example, in Watch Dogs Legion, the 285K's 1% low numbers only showed a modest 6% advantage over the 265K.

Efficiency heavily favors the Core Ultra 7 265K. The 16-game Efficiency Geomean (FPS per Watt) shows the 265K at 1.50 FPS/W, significantly outperforming the 285K's 1.37 FPS/W. This 9.5% efficiency advantage is directly linked to power consumption.

The Power Geomean confirms the 265K draws an average of 92.8 Watts during gaming, while the 285K consumes 106 Watts – a 14.3% increase for its modest performance gain. The 265K delivers more frames per unit of power, making it the cooler and less demanding option during gaming.

The performance per dollar argument is decisively won by the 265K. Our 16-game Value Geomean places the 265K at 0.48 FPS per dollar, nearly double the 285K's score of 0.25. This stark difference highlights the law of diminishing returns at the high end. The 285K costs twice as much as the 265K but only delivers a 4% average performance increase. For strictly gaming, the 285K's price premium buys minimal extra frames, making the 265K the far more cost-effective choice.

Ultimately, the Core Ultra 9 285K offers a measurable, but consistently modest, gaming performance advantage over the Core Ultra 7 265K at 1080p, typically around 4-6% in averages and 1% lows across a broad suite of games. Its primary advantages manifest in slightly higher sustained performance in CPU-intensive titles. However, these gains come at significant costs: a 14% increase in power consumption (reducing efficiency by 9.5%) and, most critically, a doubling of the price, resulting in the 265K offering nearly twice the value.

⭐ Winner: Tie

For gamers prioritizing price-to-performance and efficiency, the Core Ultra 7 265K is a compelling choice and the overall winner for the overwhelming majority of gamers. The 285K's minor performance uplift is justifiable only if the budget is not a constraint and every last frame is critical. However, it represents a steep premium for limited gaming gains over its sibling. The extra bit of performance in compute power could be helpful in the most demanding of multi-tasking while gaming scenarios.

That said, neither of these chips is a chart-topper in gaming, as you can see above. As such, you should also explore other options if you're looking for strong value at these price points.

Our thoroughly tested benchmark data reveals a clear and consistent performance hierarchy between the Core Ultra 9 285K and the Core Ultra 7 265K in productivity workloads, with the 285K holding a significant, though workload-dependent, advantage.

The most telling metric comes from the overall multi-threaded performance ranking (Geomean), where the results show a substantial 18.2% performance delta in favor of the flagship 285K across a suite of tests, including Cinebench, POV-Ray, V-Ray, Blender, and Handbrake, among others. This gap underscores the impact of the 285K's higher core/thread count.

In Cinebench 2024 Multi-Core, a cornerstone CPU rendering test, the 285K achieves a substantial 15.9% lead over the 265K. The gap widens further in POV-Ray Multi-Core, a pure ray-tracing workload, where the 285K beats the 265K by a notable 14.0%.

Even in Handbrake x265 10-bit encoding, a real-world video processing task, the 285K maintains its lead with an 11.4% advantage. This consistency across diverse rendering and encoding tasks confirms the 285K's superior capability for heavily parallelized productivity applications.

While the 285K's multi-threaded dominance is clear, the gap narrows considerably in single-threaded performance, which is crucial for many everyday productivity tasks and applications with limited threading. Our overall single-threaded performance ranking (Geomean) places the 285K at 276 points and the 265K at 270 points, a much smaller but still meaningful 2.2% difference.

This tighter margin is reflected in component tests: the 285K scores an advantage of 4.1% vs the 265K in Cinebench 2024 Single-Core, and completes the LAME MP3 encoding task nearly 1% faster than the competition. This indicates that for lighter, less parallel tasks, the performance difference between the two chips becomes less pronounced, though the 285K consistently holds a slight edge.

The performance delta also manifests in modern web-based productivity. The WebXPRT 4 benchmark, simulating HTML5 and JavaScript workloads common in web apps, shows the 285K taking a 3.5% lead over the 265K. While smaller than the gaps seen in pure rendering/encoding, this difference can still translate to perceptibly snappier performance in complex web applications and services, reinforcing the 285K's overall productivity advantage across a broader spectrum of tasks.

As expected, the Core Ultra 9 285K establishes a definitive lead over the Core Ultra 7 265K in productivity performance, particularly in heavily multi-threaded scenarios like rendering and encoding, where its advantage ranges from 11% to 18%. This lead narrows to 2-4% in single-threaded and lighter workloads, but the 285K consistently maintains the top position. The 265K, however, counters with exceptional value, delivering performance that often surpasses previous-generation high-end chips at half the price of the 285K.

⭐ Winner: Intel Core Ultra 9 285K

It comes as no surprise that the flagship Core Ultra 9 285K takes this round simply because of its higher core and thread count. However, the competition was not as one-sided as it initially seemed to be.

Both the Intel Core Ultra 7 265K and Core Ultra 9 285K share the same underlying Arrow Lake architecture, which means they possess identical overclocking features and capabilities. However, the 285K offers slightly better overclocking potential due to its higher base specifications and additional cores.

It also benefits from higher quality silicon binning, meaning Intel selects the most efficient and robust chips for this tier. This typically translates to an inherently higher tolerance for elevated voltages and temperatures under load, providing more thermal and electrical headroom for enthusiasts to exploit.

Both processors utilize Intel's advanced Arrow Lake overclocking features, including unlocked multipliers, DLVR (Digital Linear Voltage Regulator) support, and per-core voltage control. Intel has also increased the thermal limit to 105°C for better overclocking headroom compared to previous generations. Enthusiasts will find the essential BIOS/UEFI settings required for pushing performance boundaries readily available for both CPUs on compatible Z-series motherboards.

The overclocking experience is remarkably similar between both processors, with minimal headroom for P-cores but significant potential for E-core overclocking. Both CPUs can achieve P-core frequencies around 5.5-5.7 GHz and E-core frequencies up to 4.7-5.0 GHz under proper cooling conditions.

For overclocking enthusiasts, the Core Ultra 9 285K is the slightly superior choice despite its higher price point. The 285K's higher base power limits and better binning make it more suitable for sustained overclocking sessions. However, the 265K remains an excellent overclocking platform that offers nearly identical capabilities at a lower cost. Its lower peak power draw and thermal output leave relatively more room for overclocking experiments.

⭐ Winner: Tie

Although there are some differences in the overclocking experience of the two processors, their benefits and drawbacks ultimately cancel each other out, leading to a stalemate in this round.

Based on our thorough testing results, Intel's Core Ultra 7 265K and Core Ultra 9 285K exhibit significant differences in power behavior, impacting both efficiency and cooling requirements.

At idle, the 265K demonstrates a clear advantage. During full system idle, the 265K consumes exactly half as much power as the 285K, according to our benchmarks. This gap persists in active idle scenarios like YouTube playback, where the 265K exhibits a substantial 22% power draw advantage over its older brother. This suggests the 265K's power gating is more refined for low-load states, offering tangible energy savings for routine desktop use.

Under sustained heavy loads, the 285K's higher performance ceiling comes with substantial power costs. In Prime95 Small FFTs test with AVX, the 285K consumes, on average, 5% more power than the 265K.

The disparity widens in real-world workloads: during HandBrake x265 encoding, the 285K consumes 27% more power than its younger sibling, which is exactly the same difference that we found in the Cinebench 2024 Multi-core test. This consistently higher power draw under load is likely due to the 285K's aggressive boosting to leverage its additional cores and higher clocks.

The efficiency analysis reveals even more points in favor of the 265K. In HandBrake, the 265K is markedly superior, achieving a 13.8% higher efficiency in our tests, meaning the 265K delivers more performance for each watt consumed in this task. However, Cinebench 2024 efficiency test shows near parity, with both CPUs being quite close to each other in terms of efficiency.

This indicates that while the 285K consumes significantly more absolute power in Cinebench, its higher raw performance output may balance efficiency for this specific benchmark. The 285K's efficiency is more workload-dependent, while the 265K shows greater consistency.

Cooling demands correlate directly with power consumption, as higher wattage generates more heat. The 285K's higher sustained power consumption (peaking near 325W-330W in AVX loads) translates directly into greater heat output. This necessitates a substantially more robust cooling solution (high-end air cooler or 280mm+ AiO liquid cooler) compared to the 265K, which peaks around 310W-315W.

While 15-50W might seem marginal, it represents a significant thermal density increase, pushing cooling systems harder and potentially increasing noise levels under full load. The 265K will be demonstrably easier and cheaper to cool effectively, and you can get away with a robust air cooler or a 240mm AiO liquid cooler.

Looking at the evidence, the Core Ultra 7 265K emerges as the more power-efficient processor overall. Its significantly lower idle consumption and consistently lower load power in most benchmarks make it the better choice for energy-conscious users or quieter systems. While the 285K matches its efficiency in some benchmarks, its higher absolute power draw makes it substantially harder and more expensive to cool effectively under sustained heavy workloads.

⭐ Winner: Intel Core Ultra 7 265K

If outright peak performance is the absolute priority, the 285K delivers it, but at a significant cost in power and thermal headroom. For a balance of strong performance, superior efficiency, and easier cooling, the 265K holds a clear advantage in this round.

Intel's recent $100 price cut on the Core Ultra 7 265K, bringing it down to an MSRP of $290 (we see current retail pricing between $280 and $295), dramatically reshapes the value proposition against the flagship Core Ultra 9 285K at an MSRP of $580 ($560 to $620 at retail ). Analyzing just the CPU cost tells only part of the story; the true impact lies in the total platform investment required to unleash these processors' potential, especially for enthusiasts.

Both CPUs require the same LGA 1851 socket, meaning motherboard costs (Z790 or future Z890 chipset) are largely comparable. Similarly, DDR5 memory costs are identical regardless of which CPU is chosen. The critical divergence comes with power delivery and cooling demands.

The Core Ultra 9 285K's significantly higher base and boost power targets necessitate a more robust power delivery subsystem (VRM) on the motherboard and a substantially more powerful cooling solution. While a capable mid-range air cooler or 240mm AIO might suffice for a moderately overclocked 265K, taming a heavily overclocked 285K almost universally demands a premium motherboard with top-tier VRMs and a high-end 280mm or 360mm AIO or exotic cooling, adding potentially $100-$200+ to the platform cost compared to the 265K setup.

The Core Ultra 7 265K offers significantly better value for the vast majority of enthusiasts. The $290 price tag post-cut is exceptionally compelling. The price difference (also $290) at the CPU level translates to an even larger effective gap when factoring in the savings on cooling and potentially a slightly less extreme motherboard requirement.

These massive savings can be redirected towards a substantially better GPU, more/faster storage, or simply a lower total system cost. While the Ultra 9 285K delivers ultimate multi-core performance, its price premium is steep, and the platform cost amplification erodes its value proposition severely. The 265K provides near-flagship gaming performance and robust multi-core capability at a platform cost that feels genuinely balanced.

For enthusiasts prioritizing maximizing performance-per-dollar across their entire system build, the Core Ultra 7 265K is the definitive value champion. The Ultra 9 285K remains a justifiable purchase only for those seeking absolute peak performance, regardless of cost, or for specific highly multi-threaded workloads where its extra cores provide tangible, revenue-generating benefits that offset the high platform expense.

⭐ Winner: Intel Core Ultra 7 265K

While the 285K offers additional efficiency cores and marginally better performance, the 100% price premium cannot be justified by the modest performance improvements. The 265K provides nearly identical gaming performance and excellent productivity capabilities at half the cost.

With a final score of 4-4, we're technically left with a dead heat, but the real decision boils down to your budget and use case.

The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K has a decisive win in raw specifications and productivity performance, underscoring its position as Intel's current desktop flagship. However, its gaming performance is uncomfortably close to the Core Ultra 7 265K, only winning by a mere 4.4% despite costing exactly twice as much as the 265K. When installed on a high-end platform with ample cooling, the 285K delivers the absolute peak performance available within this Intel generation, but due to the lackluster gaming performance relative to the much more affordable 265K, it has a hard time justifying its premium status for the gaming crowd.

The Core Ultra 7 265K delivers a powerful counterpunch where it matters most for many enthusiasts: real-world value and efficiency. Its convincing wins in the efficiency and pricing rounds (amplified by Intel's recent $100 cut) paint a compelling picture. This chip offers nearly the same gaming performance as the flagship at half the cost, and that's tough to beat. The 265K offers a staggering amount of near-flagship performance, particularly strong gaming at its price point, and very strong productivity performance, while demanding significantly less from your wallet, your motherboard's VRMs, and your cooling solution.

That said, neither of these chips is a chart-topper in gaming, as you can see in our analysis and CPU benchmarks in the gaming section. As such, you should also explore other options if you're looking for the best CPU for gaming at these price points.

Ultimately, if you choose one of these chips, your choice boils down to priorities. If uncompromised peak performance is your sole objective and budget is secondary, the Core Ultra 9 285K is your champion. It delivers the highest frame rates, the fastest renders, and the most cores of any current-gen Intel CPU.

However, for the overwhelming majority of enthusiasts seeking high-end performance balanced with smart spending, thermal efficiency, and outstanding value, the Core Ultra 7 265K is the wiser, more compelling purchase. It gets you remarkably close to the flagship experience while freeing up substantial budget for other system components that will provide a tangible benefit.

Thermaltake Technology Co., Ltd., established in 1999 and headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan, has carved out a significant niche in the computer hardware market with its distinctive approach to cooling solutions and power supplies. The company began as a cooling specialist but has since expanded into a comprehensive computer hardware manufacturer, covering everything from chassis and cooling to power supplies and peripherals. However, as they say, you cannot have your cake and eat it too – expanding into multiple market segments sometimes means sacrificing specialization for breadth.

In this review, we examine the Toughpower GX3 850W, Thermaltake's entry into the budget-conscious segment of the 850-watt power supply market. The unit claims full compatibility with Intel ATX 3.0 specifications which supports up to 200% power excursion, reaches 60% low load efficiency and includes a native 16-pin 12VHPWR connector that can deliver up to 450W for PCIe 5.0 graphics cards. With its five-year warranty and $100 retail price point, this unit positions itself as a future-proof solution for budget-minded builders, though our analysis reveals several concerning compromises that may leave users wondering if they are getting what they bargained for.

The Thermaltake Toughpower GX3 850W arrives in a sturdy cardboard box featuring a black and grey aesthetic theme that emphasizes functionality over flashy marketing. The front panel showcases the unit itself in a straightforward product photograph, while the packaging provides adequate protection through a nylon pouch and strategically placed foam inserts.



The included bundle takes a minimalist approach, containing only the essential mounting screws and AC power cable. Thermaltake has thrown in a few basic cable ties for rudimentary cable management, but do not expect any premium accessories or comprehensive cable management solutions.



The unit features entirely hardwired cables in an all-black configuration, utilizing flat, ribbon-like designs without external sleeving on most connections. The sole exception is the ATX connector, which has a nylon sleeving. The decision to use a completely non-modular design in today's market is somewhat perplexing, especially given that the vast majority of quality power supplies now offer modular connectivity for improved case aesthetics and airflow management. However, it does make sense for users who would rather sacrifice aesthetics if they were getting something else, were it be a lower price or better performance than competitive products.

Thermaltake has adopted a utilitarian design philosophy for the GX3, prioritizing function over form while maintaining a professional appearance. The unit is finished with satin black chassis paint that, while attractive, proves somewhat prone to fingerprint marks during handling. Decorative stickers adorn the sides of the unit, while the electrical specifications and certification labels occupy the top surface in a clean, organized layout.



The unit adheres precisely to the 140mm length specification, ensuring compatibility with any ATX-compliant case without concerns about clearance issues. The front panel houses only the standard AC cable receptacle and power switch, maintaining the clean aesthetic. Since all cables are hardwired, the rear panel remains completely plain and unadorned.



The fan guard integrates directly into the chassis with an attractive dash-pattern ventilation design that extends to the unit's sides, providing some visual interest while improving airflow characteristics.

Cooling duties fall to a GuangQi GQR1225H12H 120mm fan equipped with a fluid-dynamic bearing system. This bearing technology offers an excellent compromise between operational longevity and noise levels, which proves particularly important since this unit lacks the zero-RPM mode found in many contemporary power supplies. However, GuangQi represents an unusual choice in the power supply market, as this manufacturer rarely appears in PC power supply units, and comprehensive information about the company proves surprisingly scarce.



The OEM behind this power supply is CE-LINK, a Chinese company established in 2004. While CE-LINK has been operating for two decades, they remain one of the younger players in the power supply manufacturing field, and their products primarily appear in budget-oriented power supplies rather than high-performance units.

The internal filtering stage implements a basic but functional design with four Y capacitors, two X capacitors, and two filtering inductors. While this configuration meets minimum requirements for effective noise suppression, it represents the bare minimum approach rather than the robust filtering found in premium units.



There are two rectifying bridges mounted on a substantial shared heatsink that also accommodates the APFC stage and primary inversion components. The active APFC components consist of two MOSFETs and one diode, though identification proves impossible due to extensive use of glue. A standard inductor pairs with a Teapo 820 μF capacitor to complete the APFC circuitry. The primary inversion stage employs two FuXin MOSFETs in a half-bridge topology configuration, mounted on the same heatsink as the APFC components. While the heatsink provides reasonable heat dissipation surface, it appears somewhat modest considering the unit's 850-watt output rating and efficiency characteristics.



Six Alkaidsemi AKG60N023G MOSFETs located on a vertical daughterboard handle primary 12V line generation, while separate DC-to-DC circuits on another vertical daughterboard manage the 3.3V and 5V secondary rails. The secondary side capacitors represent a mix of Teapo and ChengX components with a single Nippon Chemi-Con unit, reflecting the budget-oriented component selection throughout the design.



For the testing of PSUs, we are using high precision electronic loads with a maximum power draw of 2700 Watts, a Rigol DS5042M 40 MHz oscilloscope, an Extech 380803 power analyzer, two high precision UNI-T UT-325 digital thermometers, an Extech HD600 SPL meter, a self-designed hotbox and various other bits and parts.

During cold testing conditions, the Thermaltake Toughpower GX3 850W demonstrated mediocre efficiency performance that barely meets its 80 Plus Gold certification requirements. At 115 VAC input voltage, the unit achieved an average nominal load efficiency of 88.5%, while 230 VAC input improved efficiency to 89.4%. This unit lacks a Cybenetics or PPLP.info certification.

The efficiency curve peaks at approximately 50% load, which represents typical behavior for most power supplies, but efficiency drops precipitously at higher loads. The unit shows relatively poor performance under very light loads, suggesting that users running basic systems may not benefit from optimal efficiency characteristics.

Fan operation maintains low speeds up to 500 watts of load but increases sharply beyond this threshold, creating noticeably higher noise levels during sustained high-power operation. The thermal performance proves acceptable under normal ambient conditions, though this changes dramatically under elevated temperatures.

High ambient temperatures create severe detrimental effects on the unit's electrical performance, particularly at higher loads, suggesting significant thermal stress within the design. Average nominal load efficiency drops to 86.2% at 115 VAC and 87.1% at 230 VAC, representing substantial performance degradation.

The fan responds much more aggressively under elevated ambient conditions, beginning its speed ramp earlier and reaching maximum RPM shortly after the unit exceeds 80% capacity utilization. Internal temperatures become extremely elevated during prolonged high-load operation, and in the admittedly unrealistic scenario of continuous 100% capacity operation, the GX3 does eventually shut down. This thermal behavior suggests that the unit's heatsink design and component selection could do with a significant upgrade.

The Thermaltake Toughpower GX3 850W delivers generally acceptable electrical performance and power output quality for its market segment. Voltage ripple filtering proves quite good for a unit in this price category, with maximum ripple levels of 52 mV on the 12V rail, 28 mV on the 5V rail, and 24 mV on the 3.3V rail, all well within acceptable industry standards.

Voltage regulation demonstrates excellent performance on the primary 12V rail at 1.0%, but becomes more relaxed on the secondary rails at 2.6% for the 5V line and 2.8% for the 3.3V line.

During our thorough assessment, we evaluate the essential protection features of every power supply unit we review, including Over Current Protection (OCP), Over Voltage Protection (OVP), Over Power Protection (OPP), and Short Circuit Protection (SCP). All protection mechanisms were activated and functioned correctly during testing.

Protection features function correctly during testing, with OCP triggering at 132% for the 3.3V rail, 136% for the 5V rail, and 112% for the 12V rail. The OPP activates at 118% under hot conditions. Notably, the OCP protection on the 12V rail proves very sensitive and sharp for an ATX 3.0 certified unit, which explains the 450W limit on the 12VHPWR connector and hints that this platform was an older design that was tweaked into ATX 3.0 compliance.

The Thermaltake Toughpower GX3 850W represents a challenging product to recommend in today's competitive power supply market. While the unit technically meets its basic specifications and achieves 80 Plus Gold certification, it does so by the narrowest of margins and exhibits several concerning characteristics that limit its appeal.

The decision to utilize CE-LINK as the original equipment manufacturer results in an unproven platform that appears to be an older design retrofitted to accommodate modern ATX 3.0 requirements. The 12VHPWR connector's 450-watt rating on an 850-watt unit seems particularly conservative and raises questions about the unit's ability to handle the power excursions required by modern high-end graphics cards. Component selection throughout the design reflects budget priorities, with most active and passive components sourcing from manufacturers rarely seen in high-performance power supply units. While these companies may produce reliable products, the lack of proven track record in enthusiast-grade power supplies creates uncertainty about long-term reliability and performance consistency.



Thermal performance represents perhaps the most significant concern, with the unit exhibiting severe performance degradation under elevated ambient temperatures and becoming uncomfortably loud under sustained loads. The unit is rated for operation up to 40 °C, so it does not fall out of its specifications, but the test results do not reflect a premium PC PSU.



At the $100 retail price point, the GX3 faces formidable competition from more established designs offering better component quality, modular connectivity, and superior thermal performance. While the five-year warranty provides some peace of mind, it falls short of the seven to ten-year warranties commonly offered by competitive products in this power range. For users seeking a basic 850-watt power supply for moderate gaming systems that will not be subjected to sustained high loads or elevated ambient temperatures, the GX3 may prove adequate. However, enthusiasts, overclockers, or users planning to utilize high-end graphics cards would be well-served to consider alternative options that offer better thermal performance, component quality, and long-term reliability.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","3 diets may help lower diabetes risk: What do they have in common?","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/mediterranean-dash-or-ahei-which-diet-lowers-diabetes-risk-the-most","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 06:45:34 GMT","

According to a new meta-analysis, or study of studies, following any of three healthy diets can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

People whose food consumption closely adhered to the eating patterns established in the Mediterranean diet, the DASH diet, and the AHEI diet had lower chances of developing diabetes.

The greatest reduction of diabetes risk, 23%, came for those closely following the DASH diet, followed by the AHEI diet, 21%, and the Mediterranean diet, 17%.

The researchers analyzed the findings of 33 reports describing associations between diet and diabetes, encompassing the medical histories of over 800,000 people.

An important finding of the meta-analysis is that its conclusions applied across a broad range of populations, including African, Asian, European, and Hispanic ethnic groups. This is noteworthy because these groups have different food cultures and different levels of diabetes risk.

One limitation of the analysis is that the decrease in risk, though apparent, did not reach a level of statistical significance for Hispanic people or mixed ethnic groups. 

The researchers suggest that this may be due to having less data for these populations in the original studies. They say further investigation, particularly for these populations, is warranted.

The results of the meta-analysis will be presented in September 2025 at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Vienna, Austria. They are yet to appear in a peer-reviewed journal.

Perhaps the best-known of the three diets cited in the meta-analysis is the Mediterranean diet. This diet is based on the eating patterns practiced by long-lived people living in the vicinity of the Mediterranean Sea.

It is characterized by an emphasis on unprocessed foods, fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and lean sources of protein.

The DASH diet, as its full name — Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension — suggests, helps a person reduce their intake of sodium and to increase their consumption of magnesium, calcium, and potassium to help maintain a healthy blood pressure. It is in many ways not very different from the Mediterranean diet.

Perhaps the least familiar diet mentioned in the metastudy is Harvard University's AHEI diet.

Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, a preventive cardiology dietitian and heart health expert at Entirely Nourished, not involved in this research, explained what the AHEI diet is:

“The AHEI (Alternative Healthy Eating Index) diet is a research-based scoring system developed to assess diet quality based on how well it aligns with dietary patterns that have been shown to lower chronic disease risk. It encourages high consumption of fiber-dense foods like vegetables, whole fruits excluding juice, whole grains, nuts, legumes; healthy fats like polyunsaturated fats, and lean proteins, specifically fish and poultry. It limits red and processed meats, refined grains, sodium, and sugar-sweetened beverages.”

All three diets share some underlying concepts, said Jason Ng, MD, BA, who teaches endocrinology and metabolism in the Department of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.

They all, “contain the common theme of focusing on healthy fats, more plant-based foods like vegetables and fruits, and staying away from processed foods and keeping away from high sugar and added sugars to foods, which are all cornerstones of type 2 diabetes management,” said Ng, who was likewise not involved in this research.

The foods people consume are a major driver of diabetes, said Ng. “Type 2 diabetes is caused by increasing insulin resistance.”

“Carbohydrates,” he explained, “especially processed sugars, for example, lead to extra work for the body to process. Over time, potential insulin resistance increases, which forces the pancreas to make more insulin to compensate. When the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to manage blood sugars, you develop [type 2 diabetes].”

Routhenstein noted that some popular foods are particularly likely to cause this to occur, citing sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grains such as white bread and pastries, processed and red meats, and fried and fast foods.

In addition, she said, “diets high in added sugars and sodium but low in fiber-rich whole foods significantly increase diabetes risk by promoting inflammation, impairing insulin sensitivity, contributing to weight gain, and disrupting gut health, all of which play a role in poor glucose regulation.”

“The DASH diet has a slightly higher emphasis on sodium intake that may indirectly worsen insulin resistance,” Ng hypothesized, “so an emphasis on low sodium may indirectly help insulin sensitivity and, thus, improve [type 2 diabetes].”

Routhenstein was drawn to another aspect of the DASH diet, pointing out that it “has the unique offering of honing into certain micronutrients.”

“For example,” she explained, “[the DASH diet] is abundant in both potassium and magnesium that not only supports healthy blood pressure but also plays a key role in glucose metabolism, enhancing insulin sensitivity, facilitating cellular glucose uptake, and reducing systemic inflammation, creating a metabolic environment less prone to diabetes development.”

Ng suggested it is unclear if these diets can reverse diabetes once it has developed, but suggested it makes sense to give one a try.

He noted that “although reversing [type 2 diabetes] is a complex process, any diet that emphasizes healthy eating, which all of these do, can only help reduce the progression of [type 2 diabetes] and obtain better sugar control and improved insulin sensitivity.”

Blood pressure (BP) measurement is a core component of patient assessment in clinical care. It helps guide medication dosing, supports treatment decisions, and is essential for the diagnosis of hypertension. As high BP is often asymptomatic, its accuracy is critical. Measurement errors can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. 

The Riva-Rocci-Korotkoff method, which uses a cuff sphygmomanometer to measure brachial BP, has been used in clinical practice for more than 100 years. Although BP thresholds and treatments have evolved, this method, which is now built into automated oscillometric cuff devices, remains the standard. It forms the basis of the World Health Organization recommendations and clinical hypertension guidelines. Although this technique may seem simple, it requires multiple steps to ensure accurate and consistent reading. A difference of 5 mm Hg in systolic BP could lead to the misclassification of hypertension in 84 million people worldwide. 

Recent studies have shown sex-based differences in the accuracy of automated BP measurements compared with intra-arterial BP measurements. At the same intra-arterial BP level, systolic BP measured using an automated cuff was consistently lower in women than in men, suggesting an underestimation of cardiovascular risk in women. This discrepancy may lead to unrecognized undertreatment and could help explain why women face a higher risk for cardiovascular disease at brachial cuff BP levels similar to those of men.

Anatomical differences may partially explain this variation. Individuals with a large difference between proximal and distal arm circumferences are more likely to receive inaccurate BP readings than those with a more uniform mid-arm shape. Consequently, women are more likely to experience poor fit with cylindrical cuffs that often extend beyond the elbow.

Limited data exist on how cuff size affects the agreement between automated and manual BP readings and whether this varies by sex.

A study of 3735 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (49% women; average age, 45 years) found that automated systolic BP readings were lower than manual readings. In women, the gap widened with larger cuffs, up to -6.4 mm Hg with extra-large cuffs. In men, underestimation occurred only with extra-large cuffs (-2.4 mm Hg). Differences in arm shape, body size, and adiposity were associated with discrepancies between automated and manual systolic BP readings in both sexes, particularly in extra-large cuffs.

The agreement between the automated and manual systolic BP classifications decreased as cuff size decreased from moderate for adults and large cuffs to poor for extra-large cuffs. This pattern was similar in both women and men.

Hi. I'm Art Caplan. I'm at the Division of Medical Ethics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. 

I had a difficult case brought to me recently by someone who was trying to decide what to do with a patient with very bad dementia in terms of feeding. It's not the first time I've had this kind of case brought to me by physicians, and it probably won't be the last, but it remains a thorny, tough ethics quandary. 

I think everybody understands that there is a right — and we've had this affirmed since cases like Terri Schiavo or Nancy Cruzan — to not force artificial feeding (meaning by tube, in the nose, or in the stomach) or artificial hydration upon someone who doesn't want it.

If you have the right to refuse treatment, it's been established — certainly in American law, and I would say by standards of care within the medical profession — that hydration and feeding, when they're done by mechanical means, tubes, or using artificial substances to supply nutrition, are medicine. As a medical intervention or a medical therapy, just like other interventions, such as dialysis or even refusing an amputation for a diabetic patient, the patient ultimately, if they're competent, has the right to refuse it. 

The challenge comes in the case that was presented to me. A woman, let's call her Mary Taylor, some years ago knew that she was at risk of getting Alzheimer's disease. She filled out her living will and discussed with her family that when she became demented, if she was unable to care for herself, if she couldn't recognize her family and friends, she did not want any medical interventions, including specifically hydration and nutrition. 

Sadly, she went through the course of declining and ended up at a nursing home. At the nursing home, the doctor who was treating her noticed that nurses were offering Mary food on a spoon and liquid on a spoon, that she was opening her mouth when the spoon was presented, and she was, if you will, eating and drinking. 

The physician, knowing that the family remembered this advance directive living will and knowing that they were the designated decision-makers, basically said stop the spoon-feeding. The nurses did not want to do it. They said it's ordinary care. It's not medical. It's just what you do as part of what one human being deserves from another human being — to offer them ordinary ways to drink water or to eat something. 

The case basically raises two tough ethics questions. Is feeding by spoon the same as medical intervention with artificial forms of hydration and nutrition? I believe it is. I believe that when you say “no more food and nutrition,” it isn't just the equipment. I'll put it simply: It's who's on the end of the spoon. If nurses or doctors are feeding, it's medical. It's professional care, and you should be able to say no to that.

Secondly, I do think if someone says “I don't want to eat or drink anymore,” their intent and their values are clear. You could certainly rediscuss it with the family and say she seems to be accepting food and swallowing, and ask if that changes their mind or makes them think she might have decided differently.

However, I think the wishes of the competent person, when they made the living will, are what should drive care if the person loses competency. They thought about it, they knew where they were headed, and I do think that's the value that ought to dominate thinking about whether we have to continue to try food and water for nutrition.

Does that mean that you can't offer ice, lip balm, or other comfort means if someone is suffering because they're getting dehydrated and so on? Absolutely not. That isn't the same as feeding them. 

Here are some lessons to consider. It's important to pay attention when someone says they don't want food and water. Are nurses or anyone in a hospital or a nursing home trying to feed them anyway because they don't think of spoon-feeding as an artificial or medical intervention? I think they need education about that, and I think it's important to make sure that does not happen if that's what they said in their advance directives.

I also believe advance directives and conversations with people, when they're competent or facing the potential loss of competency, should include discussions about whether they really mean everything, such as spoon-feeding or somebody offering you a glass of water. Is that included in what you are saying you do not want?

We have to be thorough and comprehensive in making sure that we're clear so there really aren't disputes of what people did say no to and might say yes to if they no longer are able to tell us directly.

Can simple words like ""and"" or ""then"" in online reviews help health care providers learn about their patients' experiences? 

New research shows they can, with a new analysis showing that the most common theme in negative reviews of health care facilities involved communication and administrative issues, while complimentary reviews focused on reassuring and gratifying interactions with clinicians and staff. This was uncovered by an analysis of the specific words and terms used in online reviews, which was then used to find correlations with positive or negative reviews. The work was done by a study team at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who published their findings in JAMA Network Open. 

Because so many are guided in their choices by online reviews of many different industries and products, the researchers view online reviews as an untapped resource for discovering true patient sentiments. 

The current ways in which health care facilities measure the patient experience and then take action often takes a lot of time, creating a system that lags between the actual encounter and improvements. If the real-time data from online reviews could be incorporated into tools that are easily viewed by health systems and their providers, they could make almost immediate changes for more positive experiences."" 

Anish Agarwal, MD, MPH, senior author, deputy director of the Center for Insights to Outcomes and assistant professor of Emergency Medicine

The researchers analyzed data from more than a million Yelp reviews spanning seven years (2017 through 2023) of almost 139,000 health care facilities across the United States. Using a data analysis tool called the Differential Language Analysis ToolKit (DLATK), they specifically looked at 1- and 2-star (negative) reviews, as well as 4- and 5-star (positive) reviews. 

Roughly 46 percent of all reviews were 1- or 2-stars. The word ""not"" somewhere in the text correlated most strongly to the negative reviews. Payment issues and poor treatment were most strongly tied to negative reviews, almost equally. 

Communication was a very common theme among the words the researchers determined to be correlated to negative reviews. ""Told,"" ""Said,"" ""Call,"" and ""Asked"" were among the top words associated with bad reviews. Previous work by Agarwal and his colleagues had also highlighted ""told"" as the most common term in negative online hospital reviews. 

Phone conversations (and the hold times associated with them) were common negative themes, along with feelings of unfair payment experiences and perception of poor medical treatment, although the latter was not as common as the researchers believed it would be, Agarwal said. 

More than 50 percent of the analyzed reviews were 4- or 5-stars, with ""and"" as the top term associated with those reviews by a good margin, followed by ""great."" 

Positive interactions with clinicians and staff emphasizing kindness was a top theme in the positive reviews. ""Friendly,"" ""helpful,"" and ""kind,"" were all top terms. According to the analysis, the ability of staff to relieve patients' anxiety was also a top theme uncovered, resulting in ""nervous"" and ""scared"" being terms that were actually associated with positive reviews. 

Health care reviews took a significant dip amid the COVID pandemic, and the sentiments have yet to rebound. However, the research team believes that their work points to real opportunities to improve care. 

""We believe these are systemic issues rather than isolated complaints,"" said first author Neil Sehgal, ME, an associate fellow in the Penn Leonard Davis Institute for Health Economics. ""We're interested in understanding how specific facility characteristics, such as size, ownership, or patient volume, might shape patient sentiment and communication challenges."" 

Agarwal is particularly interested in understanding more about the health care facilities who consistently score well. 

""I'd love to see where and which hospitals consistently knock this out of the park and, despite the last five to ten years, continue to provide high-quality and highly well-regarded care,"" Agarwal said. ""If we spend more time learning from those doing it well, we can all move forward.""

Real Madrid legend Luka Modric left the club last month after the FIFA Club World Cup, and thus marked the end of an era at the Spanish capital.

His competitive spirit, however, kept him looking for new pastures in Europe and it was eventually AC Milan that caught his eye as an ideal option.

The Italy-based side may not be in the UEFA Champions League next season, but they have been working hard on a rebuild in recent years to try and get back to their best. Modric's arrival, needless to say, brings some much-needed experience.

Speaking in a recent interview during his unveiling as a new AC Milan player, the Real Madrid legend spoke on his transfer and what he expected at the club as he opened a new chapter in his career.

“I always say that I love playing football and I enjoy it every day. That's why I still play. I could have chosen the easier path, another league where the competition is not so demanding, but that's not my character.”

“I always choose the harder path and that's why I wanted to come to Milan. The expectations are high here, and the competitiveness is great. This is a big league and that's why I'm here,” he added.

When asked if he spoke to Carlo Ancelotti before finalising his move to the Rossoneri, Modric said,

“Ancelotti? We spoke, and he told me all the best about Milan. He was here as a player and coach, and he told me everything about the club.”

“I have to adapt to the league as quickly as possible. I have played against Italian teams many times, and they are very organised and like to compete,” he added.

He elaborated on the role he will play at the club, saying,

“I have to see what the coach wants from me and I will try to do what I always do.” 

The Croatian legend was then asked if AC Milan were on the same level as Real Madrid, to which he said,

“Milan at that level of Real Madrid? Certainly. When I first came here, you could immediately see how big a club this is. The organisation is at a top level – the people, the fans, the stadium.”

“Everything is top-notch. You can feel the greatness, just like with other big clubs. Seven titles in Europe, second only to Real Madrid, that says a lot,” he added.

Modric was then asked about his ambitions after leaving Real Madrid and why he opted to stay in Europe instead of moving to a cash-rich lower league.

“If I had to leave Real Madrid, I wanted to continue at a big club where expectations are high. It's a shame that Milan do not play in Europe, because they are the most trophy-winning club after Real Madrid.”

“We have one game a week, maybe that's not bad because we'll have the whole week to prepare for the games,” he added.

Finally, the player reflected on his time at the Spanish capital and how he drew comparisons with his new club.

“I spent 13 years at the biggest club in the world and now I'm arriving at one that in previous years was what Real Madrid is today.”

“They lost that somewhere along the way. Milan should strive to get back to that level. It's up to me to help as much as I can this year and enjoy it,” he added.

Lucas Vazquez and Luka Modric were two Real Madrid veterans who left the club after the end of the FIFA Club World Cup.

While Modric is already plying his trade for his new club, AC Milan, Vazquez remains a free agent, even though he has no shortage of suitors either.

Earlier in the summer, Vazquez himself was linked with a move to AC Milan, while several Spanish clubs, too, have been linked with the veteran defender.

According to MARCA, Vazquez has now found himself on the radar of Espanyol, who are keen on acquiring his services this summer.

It must be noted that Vazquez had spent a brief spell at Espanyol when he was loaned out to the Catalan outfit in the summer of 2014.

During that one season, the Spaniard was involved in nine goals in 33 league matches, making him a star performer for the club.

Since then, Lucas has gone on to win five Champions League titles at Real Madrid and has featured in over 300 matches in La Liga.

Espanyol, nevertheless, are keen on signing him despite his age and feel this summer could be an ideal opportunity for them to snap him up on a free transfer.

Vazquez, for his part, has reportedly refused to negotiate with Spanish clubs out of respect for Real Madrid.

However, it will be interesting to see whether or not he could be tempted to rejoin his former club in Espanyol.

The coming weeks, therefore, could prove to be critical as Lucas Vazquez looks to take the final step of his career.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Rodrygo Performs Surprise Real Madrid Transfer ‘U-Turn'","https://www.si.com/soccer/rodrygo-surprise-real-madrid-transfer-u-turn","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 11:05:24 GMT","

Despite intense speculation over his future, Rodrygo is reportedly determined to remain with Real Madrid this summer and fight for his place under new manager Xabi Alonso.

Uncertainty began to mount towards the end of last season amid reports Rodrygo felt undervalued alongside the rest of Madrid's superstar attackers—namely Kylian Mbappé, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior—and his struggle for minutes at the Club World Cup served as evidence that new manager Xabi Alonso does not view Rodrygo as a guaranteed starter.

With Madrid believed to be open to selling for the right price, Rodrygo has found himself linked with nearly every top side across Europe, but AS state he has now firmly decided he is not interested in listening to offers.

Rodrygo is said to be committed to the idea of proving himself to Alonso and reclaiming his place in the starting lineup, confident that he has the ability to reverse his fortunes at the Santiago Bernabéu.

Among the challenges for Rodrygo is Alonso's preferred tactical system. The new boss tended to favor a narrow midfield with two central strikers—roles which were handed to Mbappé and Vinicius, with young Gonzalo García also seen as a better fit during the summer.

A winger by trade, Rodrygo may have to prove his abilities in a central role if he wants to start for Madrid, but there are already a number of attack-minded players trying to force their way into the lineup.

With Jude Bellingham sidelined after shoulder surgery, there is a spot behind the striker which appears to be available. Reports have suggested this could go to new signing Franco Mastantuono, while Brahim Díaz and Arda Güler are both pushing for minutes.

Alonso's first chance to try out a team without Bellingham will come next week after Madrid announced a surprise friendly against Austrian side WSG Tirol. All eyes will be on the role Rodrygo plays before their La Liga opener on Aug. 19.

With just under a year until the world's biggest soccer tournament kicks off on U.S. soil, one Montclair business is already gearing up to make it a celebration to remember.



Leo Sawadogo, co-owner of Montclair Brewery and a former professional soccer player from Burkina Faso, has big plans to blend his two passions—beer and the beautiful game—as the FIFA World Cup 2026 approaches. With matches set to take place just 20 miles away at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, the global event is expected to bring significant economic and cultural energy to northern New Jersey.



“We're definitely doing something special,” Sawadogo said in a recent interview. “Probably for the teams. There's a lot I can't talk about… all that is in secret. But if Ghana is coming, expect a beer with something from Ghana.”

Sawadogo, whose first love was soccer, played professionally in the Ivory Coast before an injury cut his career short. But the game never left him. After moving to Montclair, he began coaching local youth teams in 2010 and eventually opened the brewery with his wife, Denise, in 2018. Soccer, it turns out, was part of the brewery's origin story too.



“I started brewing because of soccer,” Sawadogo said. “The kids that I used to coach on the field, we all had a dream. The kids wanted to play professionally. They asked me, ‘Coach, what do you want to do when you grow up?' I told them, ‘I want to build a brewery.'”



The FIFA World Cup is expected to be a major boon for local businesses. As soccer fever builds, entrepreneurs like the Sawadogos see an opportunity to create community-centered experiences around the tournament. Sawadogo says Montclair Brewery will roll out themed beers, host match screenings, and even launch a new podcast to keep fans engaged.



“The podcast is to talk about soccer,” he said. “I constantly tell people, if I get cut, instead of blood, you probably see tiny balls coming out.” He laughed, then added: “We want to start a countdown, talk about what's gonna happen, the big players coming up. And hopefully we'll find people who are as excited as we are.”



More than just a commercial venture, Montclair Brewery has long positioned itself as a gathering place for families and soccer lovers alike. Alongside their popular craft beers, the brewery offers non-alcoholic drinks inspired by Sawadogo's childhood, such as hibiscus, pineapple-ginger, and root beer—designed with children and non-drinkers in mind.



“When we were working with the township, we told them we wanted this to be a family place,” he explained. “My mom used to make non-alcoholic drinks, so we make those too. For the kids that come with mom and dad to sit down and hopefully watch a game.”



As the countdown to kickoff continues, Sawadogo says the most meaningful moments often come not from the pitch, but from the people. “When the kids I coached won the state championship, they came back to celebrate here,” he recalled. “They showed me their championship rings. That made me proud. And all of that's because of soccer.

Andrey Rublev is looking to go one better than last year while competing at the 2025 Canadian Open.

The Russian is defending 600 ATP points at the Canadian Open this week, after reaching the final in 2024.

He is back in the quarter-finals this year, following a three-set victory over Washington Open finalist, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.

Rublev has managed to establish a solid infrastructure around him, having been with the same coach for almost a decade.

Rublev's coaching consistency pales in comparison with the recent coaching changes being carried out en masse across the ATP and WTA Tours. In the last month Stefanos Tsitsipas has re-hired his father after parting ways with Goran Ivanisevic, Naomi Osaka has split with Patrick Mouratoglou, and there is continued uncertainty surrounding Emma Raducanu's coaching situation.

In contrast, Andrey Rublev remains a symbol of stability in professional tennis, and he spoke about his relationship with coach Fernando Vicente in his most recent press conference.

Speaking to reporters after the match, Rublev was asked about his relationship with his coach, Fernando Vicente.

Rublev said: “Our relationship? It's more than a player and coach. He's a family member, and he will be, no matter what, for the rest of my life. Because he was there when I was completely alone. He was there for me, not seeing his family, sacrificing his family to spend time with me. 

“Yeah, we are super good together. We have amazing connection. He's super funny. We can be super open about everything with each other.

“It's kind of a relationship, I don't know. I was really liking that I was able to find someone that he's super good at tennis, he's super talented in tennis as a coach, as a player, and on top of that, like a human being, he's one of the best I've ever met.”

Rublev was then asked to explain the advantages of staying with one coach for a long time. The Russian and Vicente have worked together since 2016.

Rublev replied: “Advantages? Advantages is that he's one of the best coaches that I ever met, and I was lucky to have him.

“And then the other thing is, like I said, like a person. He doesn't work for money, he doesn't have any interest. He just wants to help because he love me. And we get already, like I said, like we are family members, and that's it.

“So he have no interests. He have a lot of humanity inside. He's super kind. He's doing a lot of things for me that normally, when you hire someone as a coach or something, half of the coaches they don't do those things.

“It doesn't matter how many coaches you're going to change. At this level, when you are top 10, okay, maybe there is someone who, the players who won a lot of slams, they can give some advice how to, what you need to do at these levels to achieve that moment. 

“But overall, no one can teach you anything, you are the one who can help you. Doesn't matter how much coaches you change, you're the one who is playing. 

“So if you always look for help, in the end you're not going to grow.”

Fernando Vicente has worked with Andrey Rublev for almost a decade, helping the Russian star to establish himself as one of the best ATP Tour players around.

The Spaniard reached number 29 in the world for singles as a professional player. He won three singles titles after turning professional in 1996.

Vicente had already begun coaching Marc Lopez and Marcel Granollers when he retired from tennis in 2011. The now-established coach worked with Lopez and Granollers from 2010 to 2014.

Under the tutelage of Vicente, Rublev has won 17 ATP Tour titles, including two ATP Masters 1000 titles in Monte-Carlo and Madrid.

At the Canadian Open, Rublev faces second seed Taylor Fritz in the quarter-finals. Fritz won a marathon three-set match against Jiri Lehecka in the fourth round: each set was won on a tiebreak.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Just moments after the tense exchange on the court during the final handshake between Ben Shelton and Flavio Cobolli at the ATP Toronto 2025, the American player himself clarified the reason for the argument: ""He made a gesture in the tiebreak and I asked him about it. He said it wasn't directed at me, so all good,"" said a rather serious Shelton, but making it clear that the issue doesn't go beyond that.

Novak Djokovic withdrew on Monday from this week's start of the ATP Cincinnati Masters, with the pullout coming a year to the day from his Paris Olympic gold medal victory.

Tournament officials confirmed the news to The Athletic, meaning the 38-year-old Serb will have played no matches between his Wimbledon semi-final loss to Jannik Sinner and the US Open start in three weeks.

World number one Sinner, who like Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz skipped the current ATP Toronto Masters in order to rest and recover from Wimbledon, has been in Cincinnati since the weekend.

Sinner and his team posted a golf course selfie to social media on Monday, one day after an opening practice session at the pre-US Open event.

Djokovic, winner of 24 Grand Slam singles titles, first played Cincinnati in 2005 and won the last of his three titles there in 2023 after losing five previous finals.

 MONTREAL — Clara Tauson of Denmark upset second-seeded Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek of Poland 7-6 , 6-3 on Sunday night to reach the National Bank Open quarterfinals. 

 The 6-foot Tauson, seeded 16th in the hard-court event that ends Thursday, avenged a loss to Swiatek at Wimbledon to set up a match Tuesday with sixth-seeded Australian Open winner Madison Keys of the United States. 

 “I think, obviously, getting a win against her after losing to her in Wimbledon a couple of weeks ago is, obviously, nice, because I was not feeling great in that match, and I felt like I was playing some good tennis in Wimbledon,” Tauson said. “So I felt like if I could keep that going, I thought I had a shot.” 

 Tauson won her lone tour title in New Zealand in January, beating fellow Montreal quarterfinalist Naomi Osaka of Japan in the final. 

 Keys outlasted 11th-seeded Karolina Muchova of Czechia 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 in the windy afternoon session. 

 ""Clara's a fantastic ball-striker,” Keys said about the quarterfinal match. “She's got a big serve. She's got a lot of power on both sides. She covers the court quite well on top of everything, so I feel like she's one of those matches where you kind of have to temper a little bit and not go for things too quickly.” 

 Osaka also advanced in the afternoon, routing Anastasija Sevastova of Latvia 6-1, 6-0 in 49 minutes — the second-fastest victory of her career. Osaka had a 42-minute victory in a 2016 event in Brazil. 

 Osaka reached the final eight of a WTA 1000 or Grand Slam event for the first time in 19 months. On Tuesday, she will face 10th-seeded Elina Svitolina of Ukraine, a 6-4, 6-1 winner over fifth-seed Amanda Anisimova of the United States.

Tauson, seeded 16th in the hard-court event, avenged a loss to Swiatek at Wimbledon, where she lost 6-4, 6-1 after struggling with illness in her straight-sets loss.

The 22-year-old Tauson used her creativity and firepower to frustrate the six-time Grand Slam champion from Poland, staying calm when she was broken in the second set and sealing the win when Swiatek's backhand landed in the net.

""It's tough conditions here with the wind, but I tried my best to keep my head cool and keep working,"" Tauson said in her on-court interview.

""Even though I got broken in the second set, I was feeling confident and I'm really happy about the win.""

Swiatek's loss came a day after top seed Coco Gauff was stunned in straight sets by Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko, and both Swiatek and Gauff will look to sharpen their games ahead of the start of the U.S. Open later this month.

World number one and U.S. Open defending champion Aryna Sabalenka is not competing in Montreal.

Tauson, seeded 16th, will face Madison Keys in the quarterfinals after the big-serving American saved two match points to emerge with a hard-fought 4-6 6-3 7-5 win over Czech Karolina Muchova.

Tauson beat Keys in their only previous meeting in Auckland in January. Keys went on to capture her first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open later that month.

Novak Djokovic brushes off an awkward fall in the final game to advance to his seventh straight Wimbledon semifinal. (2:03)

CINCINNATI -- Novak Djokovic pulled out of the Cincinnati Open on Monday for what officially was listed as a ""non-medical"" reason, meaning he will head to the US Open without having played a match in about 1½ months.

The 24-time Grand Slam champion hasn't competed since losing in the Wimbledon semifinals to eventual champion Jannik Sinner on July 11.

That straight sets defeat against Sinner at the All England Club came two days after the 38-year-old Djokovic took what he described as a ""nasty"" and ""awkward"" fall in the last game of his quarterfinal victory. Djokovic clearly was compromised against Sinner and unable to move at his best; he received treatment on his upper left leg from a trainer.

Djokovic's withdrawal from Cincinnati follows his decision to sit out the Toronto Masters that concludes this week. He cited a groin injury for that absence.

His previous event before Wimbledon was the French Open, where he also lost to Sinner in the semifinals.

Djokovic will have no hard-court tournament preparation before the US Open singles competition begins on Aug. 24.

He has won four championships at Flushing Meadows, most recently in 2023. That was also his most recent Grand Slam trophy.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Inside the $260m transformation of the Cincinnati Open","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/cincinnati-2025-transformation-feature","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 18:03:48 GMT","

One day after Jannik Sinner lifted the 2024 Cincinnati Open trophy, everything changed.

It had nothing to do with the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. The Monday morning after last year's event ended, tournament organisers immediately began an impressive transformation of the Lindner Family Tennis Center — the result of a $260 million investment made collectively with the City of Mason, Warren County and the State of Ohio — to double the campus size to more than 40 acres and create a memorable experience for fans and players alike.

In 328 days — the time span during which a majority of the work was completed — one of the biggest tennis tournaments in the world turned into an unforgettable campus where a sporting event meets the comfort of an amusement park. 

Cincinnati Open Chief Operating Officer Jansen Dell said: “As soon as the finals ended, the following morning, we had crews on site to remove not only what the tournament setup was, but all of our furniture, all of our equipment. We had five days to take it off the site, and there were contractors who took over to start construction.”

Everyone who attends the ATP Masters 1000 event will immediately notice the differences, both big and small, with a keen attention to detail throughout the grounds and that will please fans and players alike throughout their time in Mason, Ohio.

Tournament Director Bob Moran said: “I want them to see a great event. I want them to see something that's really, really special. And it doesn't matter where you do it. It's the fact that you're doing something great in a place and putting your heart and soul into something.

“That shows through to the fans on TV, it shows through to the fans who are in the stands. It shows to the players or partners or volunteers that the group that's putting this on, from ownership on down, is committed to creating an exceptional experience. And we hope that shows through in every asset that we have.”

When players used to pull into the facility, there were a series of trailers in a large parking lot for credential pickup, stringing and more. That space now hosts a state-of-the-art 56,000-square foot building called The Clubhouse, a de facto giant players' retreat.

The biggest tennis stars in the world will enter the Cincinnati Open through a new, modern building that will accommodate all their potential needs. At the end of the initial hallway will be the tournament trophy, a clear reminder of the stakes at the Masters 1000 event. In the building will be a restaurant with plenty of space and seating both inside and outside, a coffee bar, copious lounge spaces indoors and outdoors, and a massive indoor recovery space with luxurious massage chairs.

There is plenty more to highlight around The Clubhouse, from the two padel courts to the abundance of synthetic turf — there is more than 72,000 square feet of it around the grounds — for players to enjoy. But there has also been a tremendous transformation to the Performance Center, which used to be the players' lounge, dining, fitness centre and locker rooms all in one.

The bottom three floors of the building have been renovated, expanding locker rooms to two levels instead of only being on the bottom floor. The players will enjoy their new contemporary homes, which include cold plunges, physio tables and more.



The previous player dining is now a jaw-dropping gym, which players can reach not only from the within the Performance Center, but from a short walking bridge extending from the second floor of The Clubhouse. There are four gyms overall — two indoors and two outdoors — but the main one has a large nutrition bar, which will help players recover from their tough fitness sessions. These are just some of the new-and-improved amenities for players in Cincinnati.

“I can't recreate the mountains of Indian Wells in Cincinnati, Ohio. But what we can do is have a really good effect on the few experiences that the players have when they're here. And it's both on site and off site,” Moran said. “On site, let's just create the best spaces we can. Let's provide the best food and service we can. Let's have the best gym that we can. Let's give them enough space to find their own place, find their own time when they want to get away. They have that. 

“And then off-site, it's like, ‘Hey, do you want to play golf? Do you want to go to a great restaurant? Do you want to go watch soccer to FC Cincinnati, or want to go to a Reds' game?' We are going to do all of these things.”

Fans will be blown away that the site has doubled in size, but they can get closer to the players than ever before. There are 31 outdoor courts — up from 17 in 2023 — with a fresh eye-catching two-tone blue colour scheme. There is a new block of 10 practice courts at the southern end of the facility, where fans can come within feet of their heroes.

“The practice courts, it's important for me to give access so fans can see it. They can feel it. They don't have to be on Centre Court watching a match,” Moran said. “They can be on a practice court watching their favourite player in the world, a player that maybe sometimes can't get up, close and personal, but they can do it on a practice court. To me, that's really an awesome thing.”

Just steps away from the new block of practice courts is the new 2,300-seat Champions Court, a sunken stadium just inside the new South entrance. As thousands of fans enter the Cincinnati Open, this will be their first touchpoint with the tournament. They can walk right up to the court and immediately see action the moment they arrive, without being blocked by daunting walls or obstacles.

The Cincinnati Open asphalt has been replaced with concrete, providing a far lighter, more comfortable feel for everyone in the intense North American summer heat and humidity. The various flowers, trees and shrubs throughout the grounds help make it feel like an amusement park, where fans have beautiful views everywhere they go, concessions available, but the attractions are tennis matches instead of a ride like at nearby Kings Island.

“The tournament's always been known for its landscaping and the fact that it's the largest floral show in the Midwest. As a tennis tournament, it's pretty special,” Dell said. “We have 46,000 annuals, 30,000 perennials, and 1,300 trees. And I have been growing all of those in three and a half acres of greenhouse space since last fall. It's local. Everything is grown here locally in Cincinnati [at] two different locations, about half an hour from here.” 

There are so many new and transformed pieces of the Lindner Family Tennis Center, completed in nine sub-projects thanks to the planning of the Gensler firm and the contracting work of Barton Malow. Moran's hope is that fans who have never been to the Cincinnati Open will simply give it a shot, because once people see it, they will be hooked.

The numbers that went into the project are staggering: 1,108 tonnes of steel, 71,883 tonnes of stone, 65,000 cubic yards of dirt excavated, roughly 40 miles of buried conduit, 5,000 strands of fiber stretching more than 14 miles, 3,500 strands of copper stretching 90 miles, 600 televisions and 250 Wifi access points. There are the small accents like the metal blending Stadium Court and Grandstand to make the architecture more appealing, and the tournament logo on the weights in the gym. But beyond the statistics are a lot of heart and passion that went into making a visit to the Cincinnati Open an unforgettable experience.

Dell concluded: “On one hand, what I want is that when they walk in, they say, ‘Wow'. As soon as you walk in the gates, you notice immediately that it's a completely different tournament and that there's a brand new Cincinnati Open with a transformed campus. I think that's the initial reaction that I want people to have. And then after they've been here at the tournament, I want them to leave knowing that everything is different, but at the end of the day, it's still the same Cincinnati Open they've loved for 126 years.”

Blink, and you missed it: Naomi Osaka needed just 49 minutes to equal the best WTA 1000-level result of her comeback from maternity leave so far.The former world No. 1 surrendered just one game in defeating Anastasija Sevastova 6-1, 6-0 at the Omnium Banque Nationale in Montreal on Sunday to advance to her second career quarterfinal in Canada. Osaka's previous quarterfinal north of the border came in 2019, where she lost to Serena Williams, and since returning to tennis in 2023 following the 2022 birth of her daughter, had only previously been to the last eight at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open in Doha last winter.Sevastova, a former world No. 11 who is down at No. 386 after maternity leave and a subsequent knee injury, offered little resistance to her path to match those efforts. Osaka broke serve five times in six return games, and never lost her serve to notch her 20th win of the year—already equaling her total from 2024.""I had a solid plan coming in here, and it just happened to work out pretty well,"" Osaka said on-court after the match. She is now 4-0 under the tutelage of new coach Tomasz Wiktorowski, with whom she linked up after splitting with Patrick Mouratoglou officially last weekend.Read more: Two-time defending champion Jessica Pegula upset by Anastasija Sevastova in Montreal

Radio Rewind: 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

After dropping out in Q2 at the Hungaroring, Lewis Hamilton could not make any progress from 12th on the grid.

Lewis Hamilton's challenging weekend in Hungary continued on Sunday, with the Ferrari driver finishing the Grand Prix a lap down and outside the points-paying positions.

After a tricky first day of practice, Hamilton dropped out in the second Qualifying phase and started from 12th position – commenting afterwards that he was “absolutely useless” and Ferrari “probably need to change driver”.

Hamilton's hopes of making progress around the tight, twisty Budapest venue were low and, despite the seven-time World Champion's best efforts, he ended the 70-lap encounter where he started.

Summing up his day on F1 TV, Hamilton simply called it a “pretty bad” experience, before being asked if any progress had been possible, to which he said: “Not really, no. Just stuck where I was.”

As for his mindset going into the summer break, Hamilton stated: “Same as it was yesterday. I'm glad it's over. I'm looking forward to going away.”

In another interview with Sky Sports F1, Hamilton was asked to expand on his headline-making post-Qualifying comment that Ferrari should consider a driver change.

Pushed on whether he is finding it difficult to pick himself up, and whether he could help viewers understand his remarks, Hamilton said: “Not particularly. When you have a feeling, you have a feeling. There's a lot going on in the background that is not great.”

Meanwhile, F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali, who previously served as Ferrari's team boss, was keen to show his support for Hamilton amid the Briton's struggles.

“First of all, Lewis is a jewel, he is an incredible athlete, so no matter if it is a difficult moment, he will react, and I'm pretty sure he will show the reason why he is here,” noted Domenicali to Sky Sports F1.

“He wants to achieve his eighth title, and he will triumph again. So, stay with Lewis and he will do a great race, and be very, very strong after the summer [break].”

Hamilton's team mate, Charles Leclerc, finished Sunday's race in fourth position – the Monegasque leading away from pole position but dropping back as strategies played out and later confirming a chassis problem.

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Max Verstappen crossed the line over a minute behind race winner Lando Norris at the Hungarian Grand Prix, rounding off a difficult weekend for the Dutchman.

Max Verstappen experienced one of his more challenging race weekends with Red Bull as he lost ground to the frontrunners in Hungary and was forced to settle for crossing the line at the tail end of the top 10.

The Dutchman suffered his worst Qualifying performance of the season and was left mystified by the team's lack of pace after he could only secure eighth position on the grid, losing out to both Aston Martins and rookie driver Gabriel Bortoleto.

He confirmed that throughout the sessions, he had endured a troubling lack of grip and balance in the car which Red Bull were unable to fix before the 70-lap race around the Hungaroring.

Electing to try the two-stop strategy, Verstappen spent a large amount of time stuck in traffic behind drivers like Fernando Alonso who were extending their initial stints, leaving him needing to pull off multiple overtakes to return to the top 10 after his first pit stop.

Speaking after the race, he said: “Like my whole weekend, there was just no grip and I was just struggling a lot.

“Not how we want to be, but I knew it was going to be a tough day.”

Verstappen ultimately crossed the line in P9 but his overtake on Lewis Hamilton faced a post-race investigation from the stewards – at Turn 4, the Red Bull driver surged past and the Ferrari took to the run-off area as a result.

Ultimately no further action was taken with the pair avoiding contact.

With Red Bull losing more points to their nearest rival Mercedes, Verstappen outlined the team's mindset going into the summer break: “It's fine. It's been a tough week but we'll just keep trying, keep working, keep understanding our weaker spots and try to improve on them.”

Radio Rewind: 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

George Russell beat Charles Leclerc to P3 to set Mercedes on the right path going into the summer break.

George Russell was “really happy” to come out on top in a risky battle with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in the late stages of the Hungarian Grand Prix, earning himself his first podium finish since he took victory in Canada.

The cooler track conditions seen in Qualifying played directly into Mercedes' hands and helped the Briton to secure fourth position on the grid – this, combined with the team reverting to an old set-up, meant that Russell was able to end the session half a tenth behind polesitter Charles Leclerc.

Making the most of his strong Qualifying result, he took advantage of Lando Norris' unsuccessful challenge on Oscar Piastri, surging past the McLaren to claim P3 on the opening lap of the race.

Although Norris was able to overtake him later on – with the two avoiding a scuffle as Russell peeled off into the pits – the Mercedes driver kept up the charge, overtaking Leclerc for the final podium spot with eight laps remaining.

Asked if he was proud of the result, Russell said: “Yeah, really happy with the race today. Obviously yesterday Qualifying was a bit of a surprise… this whole weekend has been a bit surprising for everyone, but I'm so happy to be back on the podium.

“It was a bit dicey with Charles at some point!”

Leclerc did not hide his frustration over the radio after he lost the race lead to McLaren's alternative strategy, especially as his performance seemed to decline drastically in the last stint of the race due to an issue with the chassis.

This irritation came to a head when Russell got into the DRS zone of the Ferrari and launched himself down the inside of Turn 1, with Leclerc fiercely defending and prompting the Briton to complain that he moved under braking.

Russell tried again at the start of Lap 62 and managed to squeeze through amid some more risky defending from Leclerc, which resulted in a five-second time penalty for the Ferrari.

“It's one of those when you sort of commit to a bit of a divebomb, if the driver in front moves, you're already right on the limit of grip and there's not much room for manoeuvre,” Russell said after the race.

“I think we made contact on the second time, but just glad to get through it. It's a nice way to go into the break.

“It's definitely better than the races we've had so far, so I'm really pleased with that.”

The arrest of the alleged shooter has not yet been made public after a fatal shooting. 


							By 

	Katherine Schaffstall



	A mass shooting in downtown Los Angeles has left two people dead and six injured in the early hours of Monday following the Hard Summer music festival, the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter.


	A “large party” in the 1100 block of 14th Place was first shut down around 11 p.m. on Sunday after officers saw a person possibly armed with a gun go inside the venue. The person was arrested at the scene, according to the LAPD.




	At around 1 a.m. on Monday, officers were dispatched back to the area following reports of gunfire. The officers found eight people were shot upon their arrival. One man was declared dead at the scene and seven others were taken to the hospital. One woman later died from her injuries while at the hospital.

	An investigation into the shooting is ongoing.


	The LAPD couldn't confirm that the party was related to the Hard Summer music festival, though the Los Angeles Times reported that a social media post promoting the event referred to the celebration as an after party for the festival. 


	Hard Summer is a house and techno music festival that took place on Saturday and Sunday at Hollywood Park, which is next to SoFi Stadium. The 2025 event's lineup included musical acts Busta Rhymes, Dom Dolla, Barry Can't Swim, Feid, Four Tet, Kaytranada, Ladies of Leisure, Linska, Marlon Hoffstadt, Riordan, Trace, Alex Chapman + Zoe Gitter, Athen, BB Shaine, Dara Genesis, Floating Points Live and more. The two day festival included performances that took place across seven stages.


	In addition to the music sets, the event hosted several pre-parties and after parties that were promoted on the website. The music festival hosted four official after parties on Sunday, which all began at 10 p.m. local time.

The musician stars opposite Sweeney in the modern western, and is also currently writing dark comedy series 'Bloodlust' for Amazon. 


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


Halsey has been making the transition from musician to movie star in recent years — including with a breakout role in 2024's MaXXXine — but the first major project she shot is just now making its way to theaters. 


Americana — a modern western from writer-director Tony Tost which follows several people as their lives violently intertwine while fighting over an expensive Native American ghost shirt— was shot in 2022, premiered at SXSW in 2023 and is finally heading to this big screen this month.  




	“I'd been waiting a really long time, I'd been really cautiously picky about what I was going to do for my first project for getting into this world, into this space,” Halsey told The Hollywood Reporter at the film's Los Angeles premiere on Sunday. “Tony reached out and he was so personable and so talented and I just really connected with the script and the character. Little did I know we were going to be making it during COVID, which was a crazy experience. And from the moment I read the script until we started shooting, I got pregnant, had a whole pregnancy, gave birth to my son, had my son on set with me, and without giving anything away, it's really serendipitous to [her character] Mandy's arc in the film.”

	The film also stars Sydney Sweeney — who walked the carpet in her first public appearance following her American Eagle controversy — Paul Walter Hauser, Simon Rex, Eric Dane and Zahn McClarnon. It marks a reunion for Halsey and Sweeney, after the Euphoria star appeared in Halsey's 2019 music video for her song “Graveyard.”

	“We were actually hanging out a bunch during COVID, so when I got the call she was doing the movie we had like just gone hiking a few days before, so it was like, ‘Oh cool, I'll see you there,'” Halsey recalled. “It was just really great to have someone to learn from, to ask questions to — the stupid questions you don't think of. It was my first time on a movie set in a real way; just being like ‘Who do I look at? Who do I listen to? What's the cool code words I don't know, the actor lingo?' So having someone to ask the stupid questions to was great.” 


	Next up, Halsey is making another pivot and developing series Bloodlust for Amazon, serving as creator, writer and EP. The dark comedy series has also enlisted MaXXXine filmmaker Ti West to direct and executive produce. 


	“I started the pilot a few years ago and Amazon wanted it and they took it and now we're getting it on the road. There's not so much that I can say but it's really cool to be a part of a project that I don't face. It's quite relieving,” Halsey explained, confirming that she will not appear on screen in the show. “Just behind the scenes, just the puppet master,” she noted, celebrating, “I don't have to do my makeup.”

Saladin K. Patterson talks to The Hollywood Reporter about how he kept the revival's sense of humor and characters true to the original, and writing for a Disney-owned streamer about a present-day Texas community. 


							By 

	Abbey White


Associate Editor & News Writer


	In an era of reboots, sequels and seemingly never-ending franchises, the “why now?” of bringing a show like King of the Hill back is “the most important question,” says its new showrunner Saladin K. Patterson. 


	For the adult animated comedy, which debuted its story about a family living in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas, on Fox in 1997, the “why?” begins at San Francisco Sketch Fest 2017. That's when co-creators Mike Judge and Greg Daniels did a table read of an episode from the original series, which had concluded its 13-season run seven years earlier.

					How to Watch Emmy-Winning Animated Series 'King of the Hill' Season 14 Online		
			









	“The fan response was just so strong that they realized there was still an appetite for these characters. People want to know what the characters are doing,” Patterson recalls to The Hollywood Reporter. “There are always memes online, [fans asking], ‘I wonder how Hank Hill will respond to this?' That's always a good sign.”


	That journey to bringing back the show took six years from that moment to get a greenlight, and then two more to release it. In the meantime, the series — which picks up with Hank Hill returning from a decade-long stint living and working in Saudi Arabia — has returned following a new model for how TV is animated and voice-casted, a dramatic transformation in how series are released and consumed, and a culture of comedy that has undergone an expansion (and revaluation) of what audiences collectively find funny. 

	











	Patterson doesn't shy away from those things on-screen in the writing or off-screen while talking about the returning series. Instead, he openly shares exactly how those things did — and didn't — affect his pitch for a rebooted King of the Hill. That vision is what he chalks up to a return to the middle ground that acknowledges the overtone window on a lot of things have radically shifted. 


The result is a reboot that works to be both what the animated series always was — a satire about a conservative father and his family in a small Texas town — and what the moment is, in an organic and authentic way. “[King of the Hill] was maybe about that common thread that goes through all these people,” voice star Toby Huss tells THR. “And this [reboot] is about going back and revisiting these people, and letting them sit in your life for half an hour at a time, and I think that's a really special treat to give people.”


	For King of the Hill's return and the release of all 10 episodes now on Hulu, THR spoke to Patterson about revisiting Arlen and the series' distinctive sense of humor; how the writing team brought the Hills and their community into the modern era; how the industry shifts brought the team into new choices from voice casting to art styling; honoring the characters of the voice cast that have since passed; and more. 


	***


You are a veteran of the sitcom space, with credits on Frasier, The Bernie Mac Show, Big Bang Theory, and more recently Shifting Gears. You also helmed The Wonder Years reboot. As someone so familiar with comedic sitcoms who has already helmed taking a classic into the modern day via reboot, what warrants King of the Hill‘s return for you?












	To answer “why now?”, which is the most important question, for The Wonder Years, we were living in a time when the story of the Black middle class during the Civil Rights Movement hadn't been told in that way before. The parallels between what was going on in society in the country in the late ‘60s and what was going on in the early 2020s were so in your face. It felt like good commentary to look back and to be able to look at the present in a somewhat similar way, but not quite as charged. With King of the Hill, when I sat down with Mike and Greg and they were meeting with me to potentially be the showrunner, I told them the things that stood out to me about why it was interesting to do this reboot now. In the original, the character of Hank Hill (voiced by Judge) had a strong point of view, and was a very strong character known for representing a common sense middle ground. 


	Whether you lean left or right, Hank always represented the common sense middle that satirized the extremes. But Hank was the one that was bringing the extremes towards the middle, and realized we can all agree on certain things. The backstory they came up with — which I think was very smart — was of sending Hank and Peggy (Kathy Najimy) away to Saudi Arabia to work on the Aramco base for about 10 years King of the Hill time then bringing Hank back to a community and country that has changed some. What I thought was smart about that is that Hank hasn't changed that much. He comes back, but his common sense middle ground is not the middle anymore. The extreme has moved so far to the extreme that to them, Hank's common-sense middle-ground looks like the other extreme now. 

	











	That felt like a good opportunity to make some good cultural social commentary. I specify “cultural” because a lot of people, probably me included, when we talk about the original, tended to say it was a political show that made political commentary. That's really us projecting on the King of the Hill what we think and feel. The original touched upon politics sometimes, but the social commentary was more cultural. It's more about a father raising a son, but society now saying how you raise a boy is different; a culture saying how you treat a woman is different. That was where the show was, but it's also small relatable stories through the points of view of our characters. That's what we wanted to make sure we maintain with this one. And taking the opportunity that we can now have our main character have a totally different not only view of culture, but way the culture views him. That's where a lot of the comedic conflict comes from.


There's a lot of ways the original show's sense of humor is described by the people who made it and the people who watch it. Those might not always align because of how comedy ages, which underscores how hard a medium comedy is in terms of translation over time. But when you were talking to Mike and Greg, what was the central comedic tension of the original series, and how did that stay the same or change at all for this return?












	I'll answer it by using an example from the original. One of the quotes that always stands out to me was from the episode where Khan (Ronny Chieng) and Minh (Lauren Tom) first move in next door, and then Hank and Khan immediately butt heads because Khan is an asshole. Hank's point of view is, “What kind of country is this where I can only hate a man if he's white?” That speaks a lot to the irony that a character like Hank will find himself in. People will project onto Hank as a white man of a certain age at that time being Republican — he wouldn't be called a Republican now — and living in Texas a lot of things that they think they know about him. So that when he does something, it's interpreted based on what people think a character like him would feel. 


	But his point of view is, “No, no, I don't hate him because I'm racist. I hate him because he is an asshole.” That's where a lot of rich comedic irony lives, and that's what I wanted to make sure we carried over into this version of it — putting Hank in situations where people are going to accuse him or judge him or make assumptions that are based on who they think he is, or who they think he's supposed to be, and not based on who he actually is. Now he has to prove himself to be different, while not changing what he's done. That's very interesting to me, and that's where I think the show lives when it lives at its best comedic potential. 


Fox — like Adult Swim and MTV — carved out a unique space for adult animation that was really edgy and boundary-pushing, something Disney hadn't really delved into until it acquired Fox titles. How did answering to Disney versus Fox, and a streamer versus a broadcaster, shape how you approached this show? 

	











	It's a multi-layered answer. Yes, Fox back then with adult animation let certain shows really push the envelope. Family Guy really pushed the envelope. The Simpsons to a very measured extent. King of the Hill, though, never pushed the envelope in the same way, in terms of being in your face. But it may have pushed the envelope in terms of some of the social commentary. 


	So when we were doing it now for Hulu, under the Disney banner, on the one hand, the Hulu execs for the show were fans of the original, so we all were on the same page in terms of wanting to recapture what made the original special. But there were situations where the Disney of it all put some limiters on us that I know Fox would not have, even though we were on Hulu and streaming, which theoretically has broader S&P [standards and practices] than Fox. But for us, staying true to the show meant we weren't ever going to be too gratuitous with the curse words and things, but we do take some liberties. The characters do curse in ways they can't curse on broadcast. That being said, Hulu still made us go through and pull out all the F-bombs because they don't want the TV-MA label, and it's fine. Totally get it. It is what  it is. I'm not a huge fan of shows pushing the envelope in that way anyway, so it wasn't a big loss, but it was ironic, especially considering, like you said, the history of the show being on Fox where the whole purpose was to try to push the envelope as much as you could. 

	











When King of the Hill was in its initial run on Fox, its first season was actually only like 12 episodes. But that and later seasons, which were 20-plus episodes released weekly in a time when people sat in front of TVs at a specific time each night. The return is a 10-episode binge drop on a streamer. Did the shift in platform and distribution model affect at all how you all thought about writing it now?


	That question taps into something that's much, much bigger that we're all trying to figure out now and is the reason we went on strike; the actors went on strike; why there's such a contraction in the industry in terms of production drying up; and why the studios were chasing the streaming model and then realized the streaming model can't sustain itself. Everybody's trying to figure out how to match audience viewing behavior to the way business models used to work. So a microcosm of that is this whole thing that a season is 10 episodes now, and that certainly affects the stories we can tell, but not all in a bad way. In some ways, 10 episodes is creatively more refreshing than having to do 22 episodes. Trust me, the unspoken secret that we always had was it's hard doing 22 episodes, and by time you get to episode 17, you're starting to repeat yourself probably. But monetarily speaking, that was a great model. Now for streamers like Hulu and Disney Plus, it's a little different. 


	When we were breaking out the season arc, it certainly made us skip ahead, I think, in a way that we wouldn't necessarily have skipped ahead in the first 10 episodes under the broadcast model. Think about the Connie (Tom) and Bobby's (Pamela Adlon) relationship. We wanted the season to end with them getting together, so that meant, along the way, we had to jump that relationship ahead faster than we would have had we had 22 episodes to get them together. That fit to how we brought the stories and what we had to pick and choose in terms of what we showed. The word that comes to the top of my head is it makes you be more “efficient.” It also makes you figure out, assuming I want to get from A to B, what in between has to be shown to make it make sense when we get to B. Versus if I had to get to A to H, I have B, C, D, E, F and G to hit along the way. It makes us have to be a little more selective with what we have our characters experience if we're trying to get them to the same place by the end of a season.

	











This show is not something entirely new for King of the Hill, but there are new elements that expand Hank's universe. You do that by bringing in more characters, changing voice actors of others along with the rest of the industry, and adding new locations that offer different interactions. Most of the things you introduce are not outside of real, modern Texas culture and communities. Can you talk about how you approached expanding the Hills' modern-era community?  


	Some of it is just along the lines of what you're saying. We have an opportunity to do some stuff now under a different societal lens than the original show was under. Specifically, that's both to casting people of color who are the same background as the characters that they're portraying and casting a wider net to be able to include more people in the casting conversation. That was important because that's become important on a global level in terms of TV shows. But then, like you said, in terms of the characters that then populate the world that Hank experiences, it's not as simple as me saying I'm a Black writer and I want to see more Black characters in King of the Hill. King of the Hill had Black characters. Bernie Mac played a character; Chris Rock and Snoop Dogg. Fans of the OG series know that. But it's about intent and purpose, too. That show lived in a world where the stories they were telling didn't necessitate, necessarily, Hank interacting that much with other people. Now we feel like we just live in a different world. 

	











	The writing staff before we started all took a field trip to Dallas because we wanted to see what's changed over the last 10 years. We visited restaurants, we went to the news station, the newspaper, we talked to people to ask them, “What are you reporting on? What are you talking about?” And it just came up that people are mixing more in Dallas. It kind of bucks the stereotype because people think things are so polarized. It gave us an opportunity to say, “All right, who would we like to see Hank interacting with — but for the purpose of showing Hank in these new environments in the same way we show him other in other environments while having a strong point of view, being someone who represents a common ground amongst people, and as someone who follows a certain set of rules that other people can rally around.” That felt like a good opportunity. 


	A Black barber shop is filled with people who also have similar points of view and, if not similar points of view, similar approaches to things, strong opinions, but welcoming to others because part of growth is also hearing from others, right? So that felt like a type of thing that we want to see Hank in. And I guess that boils down to: Where do we think fans will want to see Hank and who do we think fans would want to see Hank interact with? And as long as that fit the mold, that's how we followed it.


Toby Huss was in a really unique position with this show's return, both stepping back from playing Kahn and then continuing the role of Dale Gribble, who was voiced by the late Johnny Hardwick. How did you all work with Toby to handle the Kahn shift and then how did you land on the decision to continue on with Dale using Toby to voice? 












	Toby almost led the charge in terms of realizing it's time to pass and let someone else play the voice of Khan. Toby's a very sensitive, sensitive guy. He has his finger on the pulse of what's going on. He's a great voice actor. And our way of looking at casting is different, and Toby was so on board with that and championing that. When Johnny unfortunately passed away, we first and foremost wanted to see what's going to honor Johnny and his family in the best way. Dale's character was too important a character to what we were currently doing to let the character go away. So it felt like he still needed to stay an organic part of the show, so that meant carrying on. That comes with a lot of consideration, both creatively and financially in terms of Johnny's family. So we first and foremost wanted to make sure that that was going to be handled in the most respectful way and a way that we'd be proud of. 


	After that, it became, creatively, what's best for the show? Then hopefully those things overlap. We looked at all the options you would think we would look at; recasting, using some sort of other technology to try to keep the voice going. What felt the most respectful and also creatively strong was taking Toby, who was a friend of Johnny's, who was like a brother to Johnny in certain ways, and having him do it in a way that would pay homage to Johnny. What people don't know is the cast will always take turns doing each other's characters like at a table read. That was a part of the family dynamic, anyway, so that felt like it was a natural extension of what the cast did amongst themselves. That's also why Toby was a good choice. 

	











Among the cast who are no longer with us are Brittany Murphy and Tom Petty, who were behind the characters of Luanne and Lucky. Did you consider bringing them back and how did you want to pay tribute to them even though they aren't present? 


	As you can imagine, a lot of thought went into that. The Luanne character was so important in the original. Brittany Murphy unfortunately passed away as they were in the original run, and they had to deal with it. They had already been dealing with her being so busy because of her movies and things, that the characters had already been phased out a little bit towards the end. Our decision was, do we revitalize that character or not? The analogy that I've been using is as a sports fan, sometimes you have a player who has meant so much to a team and an organization in terms of what they accomplished and what they represented, that when they are no longer with the team, the best thing you can do to honor them is to hang the jersey up in the rafters and to retire the number. In the case of Brittany and Tom [Petty], that felt the most respectful way to honor them. That being said, there's still going to be that void, and we kept that they have existed in this universe, and that they still do exist, even though we don't see them. Hopefully, if fans stick around and Hulu allows us to do more episodes, you'll see a way that we have come up with to address where they are, at least in a reference way.


We spoke before about the trickiness of how humor ages, and one of the ways that that appears in sitcoms is pop culture references — something King of the Hill has done from the very beginning. You keep that tradition up in this season, from The Summer I Turned Pretty to Ted Lasso. Topically, you've also got more broad signifiers of the time: ethical nonmonogony, AI, parenting vlogs, Jeffrey Epstein. Were you at all concerned about how that might in the future age your show? Or did grounding the Hills in the current moment remain more important?












	So not only were we concerned, there's an extra level of concern that you have for animation, because it takes nine months for an episode to kind of come out when they're animated. Not only do we run the risk of dating ourselves in terms of future people watching the show as an, “Oh crap, that's such a 2025 reference,” the first time people see it, the reference could be old, because it was nine months later. So that was something that we had to be very careful with. 


	And that's why, outside of South Park, most animated shows don't do it. The Simpsons do it, but they're in a unique situation and they've been doing it for 30 years. So I'll say this, when we did make a pop culture reference, it first and foremost had to feel true to the character that was saying it. It couldn't be the show making the reference. Sometimes when The Simpsons does it, the show is making pop culture references. For us, the character had to be doing it. Then from my personal point of view, if we're satirizing it, it's OK, because now we're making a comment about something, and it won't feel so dated. Hopefully, when it's watched in the future, it'll feel like we were making a statement about the time period that this show existed. That doesn't mean The Summer I Turned Pretty won't feel like a very dated reference 10 to 20 years from now. But hopefully it'll still be funny. If it's satire, it can still be funny and dated. If it's just gratuitous, it's only going to be dated. 


Viewers likely have questions about how you bring a number of these characters back, but Dale is really a stand out, especially in the Bush Library visit episode. He's a conspiracy theorist, and has always pushed misinformation and disinformation in ways people likely thought were harmless, but we're currently seeing isn't so harmless. How did you think about writing him in this moment? Did you feel any pressure to tone him down, to challenge him any more than Hank already does?  












	When I first met with Greg and Mike and we talked about how I would approach showrunning, I used Dale as an example because I felt the strength of the show and addressing the why now of it all is that Hank stays the same Hank, but his middle is not the middle anymore. Dale staying the same Dale was a way to passively make social commentary about how crazy reality has become to where now people take conspiracy theories much more extremely than Dale and treat them as fact and truth to where Dale can be the one to point and say, “I'm not that crazy.” That is such a unique position for Dale to be in, even though he'll always be the craziest. And we get our comedic conflict and his conflict with Hank from that. Living in the world where Dale's not the craziest person in the world is just a new thing for Hank to experience, too, which we tried to tap into with the Bush Library stuff. I was of the opinion, let's leave Dale where he is because that gives us an opportunity to in and of itself make a statement.


I have to ask about is the art styling for this because that's really part of how you tell story in animation, and is also impacted by the industry moment you're making a show in. The original series is real simple 2D, but you make some changes for the reboot. Can you talk about the decision-making behind that? 


	I do want to address the art because that's probably been the most universal thing that has shook the new audience when they saw the previews and things like that — that the animation looks so different. I get it, and I get why people who want to revisit the show may be taken aback a little bit. The new animation style is all digital now, but the truth of the matter is, it is impossible to do the show now the way it was done then. The hand-drawn animation, the water colors, those don't exist anymore. If they exist, they certainly don't exist at a cost where you can do a TV show. So it has to be updated, and so we updated it with the current style and makeup of animation that animated shows do. I admit it does look different and maybe jarring to some people. I just want to put out there that even though it's updated, we still went and tried to give it an age old look, to make it feel more like the color palette and the landscape of the original, more so than other shows. We certainly went through a lot of back and forth with the background designers and things like that, to make our colors feel closer to what they felt in the original and the tones and things the most that we could.

	











You end with “The Sound Investment,” which explores pensions, start-ups, and stark market manipulation. There's different outcomes for folks, but John Redcorn ends up getting an investment from The Hills. You also feature a tribute card to Jonathan here. Can you talk about that and if you've thought about how the show might move forward without Joss?   The season 14 finale was chosen as the episode where we paid tribute to Jonathan Joss with a memoriam end card because it was the episode that featured him the most. It also felt fitting because his tragic passing was so recent and the finale was the last episode produced. If there are future seasons, we will choose a way to address the Dale/Nancy/Redcorn love triangle that highlights the compassion that Jonathan always brought to the character.

Saja Boys' ""Your Idol"" jumps to No. 9.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Alex Warren's “Ordinary” holds at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, while two adversarial acts from KPop Demon Hunters take their battle to the top 10.


	“Ordinary” adds a ninth week atop the Hot 100. The song has spent all its weeks on top consecutively, having become Warren's first leader on the chart.


	Meanwhile, “Golden,” by HUNTR/X — the trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI — holds at its No. 2 Hot 100 high, as “Your Idol,” by Saja Boys — Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee — reaches the top 10, bounding 12-9. The songs, each act's first top 10, are from the hit Netflix animated film KPop Demon Hunters and its soundtrack, which notches a second week at its No. 2 best on the Billboard 200 albums chart. It rules the Soundtracks chart for a sixth week.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Aug. 9, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Aug. 5. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Ordinary,” on Atlantic Records, tallied 19.4 million official streams (down 6% week-over-week),  73.3 million radio airplay audience impressions (down 1%) and 6,000 sold (essentially even) in the United States July 25-31.


	The track keeps at No. 4 on Streaming Songs, following four weeks at the summit; secures a seventh week at No. 1 on Radio Songs; and rises 9-4 Digital Song Sales, after nine weeks on top.


	“Ordinary” also makes it a perfect 10 weeks atop the Songs of the Summer chart, having led each week since the survey made its annual seasonal return after Memorial Day.


	“Golden” by HUNTR/X repeats at its No. 2 Hot 100 high. It simultaneously tops Streaming Songs for a second week, up 13% to 28.9 million streams — as it's the Hot 100's top gainer in streaming for a fifth consecutive week.


	The song, from the hit Netflix animated movie KPop Demon Hunters, also sports surges of 31% to 4.9 million in radio audience and 19% to 5,000 sold, boosted by a remix by David Guetta, released July 25.


	Meanwhile, Saja Boys, HUNTR/X's foes in the film, bound 12-9 on the Hot 100 with “Your Idol.” The song is driven largely by streams, with 19 million (up 1%) in the tracking week.


	Despite their on-screen differences, HUNTR/X and Saja Boys team up to make KPop Demon Hunters the first movie to spin off two Hot 100 top 10s since another animated hit: In 2022, Disney's Encanto yielded the ensemble smash “We Don't Talk About Bruno” (No. 1 for five weeks) and “Surface Pressure” by Jessica Darrow (No. 8 peak), with both written solely by Lin-Manuel Miranda.


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, climbs 4-3 on the Hot 100, after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It logs an 11th week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Justin Bieber's “Daisies” dips 3-4 on the Hot 100, two weeks after it debuted at No. 2. It's the chart's top gainer in airplay for a second week (17 million, up 61%).


	Wallen's “Just in Case” keeps at No. 5, on the Hot 100 after reaching No. 2, and Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” is steady at its No. 6 high.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and finished as the year's No. 1 song, stays at No. 7 — as it adds a record-extending 102nd week on the chart overall and a record-padding 72nd week in the top 10.


	Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is stationary at No. 8 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July.


	Capping the Hot 100's top 10, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” remains at No. 10, following five weeks at No. 1 beginning in January.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: The Town is abuzz over High Side, a package based on an unpublished short story by Jaime Oliveira that looms as a potential reteam of Timothée Chalamet and James Mangold. They are just coming off A Complete Unknown, the Bob Dylan smash that got eight Oscar nominations. Chernin Entertainment is attached as producer. Sugar23, which reps Oliveira, is out to the town with the short story pitch package that also is making a buzz in publishing circles.


	In High Side, Billy is a former MotoGP racer, who is haunted by a career-ending crash and a family legacy of abandonment but is drawn back into the world of high-speed risks and extreme danger. His estranged brother, already being pursued by the FBI, recruits him for a series of bank robberies on superbikes. A gifted motocross rider, Billy walked away from the sport after a devastating accident, and he has been making do caring for his addict father and the family garage. He's blindsided when his estranged older brother Cole resurfaces — just after their father's death — with a proposition: use Billy's talents for something bigger: robbing banks. Cole assembles a mismatched crew, including a woman who becomes Billy's lover, and they begin knocking over small-town desert banks with speed and precision. But as the stakes rise, Lennox, an FBI agent who has a complicated history with Cole, closes in as the crew preps its biggest score: a bank job timed with a big motorcycle parade. There are high-speed action and emotional twists and turns in the climax.

	











	Chalamet is shooting the climax of Dune, and he has the Josh Safdie-directed table tennis drama Marty Supreme coming in December from A24. Stay tuned.

EXCLUSIVE: Inner Child, an elevated Lego comedy from James Morosini, is in early development at Universal and The Lego Group, sources tell Deadline.


	Reps for Lego and Universal declined comment, but sources close to the project said Lego Group will produce. Plot details are being kept under wraps.


	The origin story here is interesting in that the project originated as an original spec from Morosini that had nothing to do with the Lego universe. It was originally a bit of an edgier concept, written for live-action. But since falling for the script and snapping it up, execs at Universal and Lego Group have elected to take the material in a direction, visually and otherwise, befitting the Lego brand.

	First introduced in Denmark in 1932, the Lego brand has continued to engage audiences around the world by expanding into feature films more than a decade ago. In 2020, Universal closed a five-year exclusive deal with Lego for the development, production and theatrical distribution of films, a move that's been highly lucrative with films made so far grossing more than $1 billion worldwide.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Lego's films have evolved in terms of creative direction since the franchise's inception, reflecting the brand's journey from a simple toy to an entity with significantly more cultural cachet for a broad audience. The first major foray into Lego-themed media began with the direct-to-video release of Lego: The Adventures of Clutch Powers in 2010, which set the stage for more ambitious projects. The turning point came in 2014 with The Lego Movie, directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, which was a critical and commercial success, spawning a franchise that included sequels and spinoffs such as The Lego Batman Movie and The Lego Ninjago Movie.

	











	Universal and The Lego Group most recently teamed on Piece by Piece, Morgan Neville's film telling Pharrell Williams' life story with Legos, which was released under Universal's specialty label Focus Features. Last year, we were first to report on a trio of new live-action Lego movies in the works from Jake Kasdan, Patty Jenkins and Joe Cornish. Additionally, we reported exclusively on a live-action Lego Ninjago movie in the works from Kevin and Dan Hageman, the creatives behind the long-running animated series Ninjago.


	Actor-filmmaker Morosini  broke out in 2022 as the writer, director and star of I Love My Dad, a catfishing-themed comedy based on a true story, which won both the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award in its SXSW premiere before going on to distribution through Magnolia Pictures. The project led to studio attention for Morosini, who was most recently enlisted to direct a forthcoming adaptation of his Black List horror script Mommy's Home for Lionsgate, as we told you first last summer.


	As an actor, Morosini is also known for turns in Netflix's horror thriller It's What's Inside, The Sex Lives of College Girls, American Horror Story, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and more. He is represented by Anonymous Content, CAA, and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman.

This was the most entertaining movie of the summer so far for me.  Yeah, it was dumb, but it was a lot of fun.  It reminded me of 90s action movies, and I wish I could have seen it with a crowd at a theater.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Jack Haven (I Saw the TV Glow) and actress/comedian Janeane Garofalo (Wet Hot American Summer) are set to star in Grind, a darkly comedic thriller from filmmaker Peter Collins Campbell that shoots in New York City in October.


	In the indie, Haven plays Ricky, a hustle-culture-obsessed Manhattan food delivery biker on a mad dash to make all of his rent in one night. No word on the role to be played by Garofalo.


	Supported by Cinereach, Grind will be produced by Bethany McHugh for Affects Next Day's Work, with Philipp Engelhorn serving as executive producer. Allison Estrin is casting the project.

	











	In a statement on Haven's casting, Campbell told Deadline, “Jack is the kind of chameleonic actor that you don't see very often anymore, and having them anchor this film and go up against actors like Janeane who have such commanding, magnetic presence is going to be so much fun to watch. I think what we're seeing in the movies right now is an appetite for something really different, and audiences are ready for stuff that's weirder, funnier, and more creatively ambitious than what they're being given- it's the only way to make sense of the world right now.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Coming off of Gotham and Independent Spirit Award nominations for their starring turn in Jane Schoenbrun's acclaimed A24 pic I Saw the TV Glow, Haven is otherwise best known for the role of Casey Gardner in the Netflix series Atypical. They can also be seen in Gabriel Abrantes' surrealist horror film Amelia's Children and took their directorial debut October Crow to The Uncanny Film Festival in Cannes earlier this year. They are repped by Gersh and Fusion Entertainment.

	











	Known for her work in projects like Wet Hot American Summer, The Truth About Cats and Dogs, Ratatouille and Reality Bites, Garofolo has recently been seen on shows like Younger and Billions. Other recent credits include Patrick Wang's A Bread Factory and a lead role in Dan Harris' Speech and Debate opposite Sarah Steele, Liam James, and Roger Bart. She is repped by Gersh, Independent Artists Media, and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller.


	Beginning his career directing music videos in Chicago, Campbell has screened shorts at over 40 festivals and released his debut feature, Dimland, in 2021.

Could the age of Marvel's uncontested dominance finally be over? Fantastic Four: First Steps had a “just fine” debut, though it couldn't reach the heights of DC's Superman. Now in its second weekend, the latest entry in the MCU faced a disappointing 66 percent drop off. It's still Marvel's biggest hit of the year, and it still came in at the top of weekend box office, but it's certainly not the result Kevin Feige and co. would hope for as the studio attempts to course correct from the scattershot post-Endgame releases. 

The Fantastic Four was supposed to be a refreshing reset for the franchise, a movie that required no prior homework and debuted a new, alternate-universe look for the MCU. Director Matt Shakman accomplished this well enough to garner positive reviews and top Marvel's other 2025 offerings (Captain America: Brave New World and Thunderbolts). But, as Jesse Hassenger summed up in his B- review for The A.V. Club, “Being the best Fantastic Four movie isn't quite good enough to escape the MCU doldrums.” Compare this to DC's Superman, which also served as a franchise reset for its studio and currently rests at number four on the weekend box office. In his second weekend, the Man of Steel only dropped 53 percent and generated a total gross of $236,233,556 domestically. F4‘s total gross for its second weekend is just $198,427,635. 

Outside the superhero sphere, animated kids' comedy The Bad Guys 2 opened at number two for the weekend, while adult comedy The Naked Gun opened at number three. With a $17 million take (against a $42 million budget, per Variety), it's a solid debut for a genre that has been largely dormant for years. (In his B- review, The A.V. Club‘s Jacob Oller wrote that “the best thing about the comedy is that, over the blissfully brisk runtime of 85 minutes, [Akiva] Schaffer and his team never let one joke, flop or hit, linger for too long before cramming a few more into the frame.”) Long-term relationship horror flick Together opened at number six with $6.8 million (it earned over $10 million across its first five days in theaters). You can check out the weekend's full top ten below, courtesy Box Office Mojo.

It's been nearly five years since a new Spike Lee feature has hit the big screen, but the wait—at least for those of us who weren't on the Croissette this year—is almost over. This morning, A24's shared the first full trailer for Highest 2 Lowest, Lee's upcoming picture and his latest collaboration with Denzel Washington after films like Malcolm X and He Got Game. Joining them are Jeffrey Wright, Ilfenesh Hadera, and, in his second A24 film of the year, A$AP Rocky. 



An official synopsis for Highest 2 Lowest reads: 

When a titan music mogul (Denzel Washington), widely known as having the “best ears in the business”, is targeted with a ransom plot, he is jammed up in a life-or-death moral dilemma. Brothers Denzel Washington and Spike Lee reunite for the 5th in their long working relationship for a reinterpretation of the great filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's crime thriller High and Low, now played out on the mean streets of modern day New York City.

Highest 2 Lowest has so far received mostly positive reviews at festival screenings earlier this spring. In a B-grade review for The A.V. Club, critic Rory Doherty opined that Lee's film works best when it moves further from its Kurosawa source material, writing, “As the second half of William Alan Fox's script slips away from the structure of High And Low, the diminished presence of the smooth, unmotivated Apple TV+ shooting style makes everything more compelling.” 

Highest 2 Lowest debuts in limited theaters on August 15, and hits Apple TV+ on September 5.

There's always been a loose, fun vibe whenever Conan O'Brien interviews Timothy Olyphant. Perhaps too loose, as the environment on the latest Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend podcast encouraged the actor to reveal his own involvement in the upcoming Once Upon A Time… In Hollywood sequel. Olyphant played TV actor James Stacy in Quentin Tarantino's 2019 film, and he's apparently been invited back for the sequel, which David Fincher is directing for Netflix.

Over the course of a funny, characteristically bit-filled conversation with his old friend, the subject of Once Upon A Time… came up. O'Brien hadn't heard that the sequel was officially greenlit, to which Olyphant gave an affirmative “Yep” before mouthing to co-host and producer Matt Gourley, I'm in it. That would've flown if the podcast was truly audio only, but he quickly realized he was on camera: “Are they filming this?” he asked with a laugh. “That camera just caught whatever you did,” co-host Sona Movsesian warned him. They asked him if he wants them to cut the admission out of the episode, and Olyphant sheepishly replied, “I don't know… let's see.” You can check out the full pantomime below around the 43:19 minute mark:

﻿

“I'm hoping I'm in it. That'd be good. You never know, it only is what it is. But my understanding is I'm in it,” he mouthed, continuing the bit. Rather than be excited about getting a big scoop on the podcast, O'Brien was indignant that Olyphant hadn't revealed the news to him sooner. “I think you would've told me that. You knew what a huge fan I am of the first film. You think you would've mentioned that to me,” the comedian complained. “It was just a few weeks ago… I wasn't sure… I mean, I'm still not sure,” Olyphant hastily corrected himself. “[They'll] find out about this and say, ‘What's he doing talking about it?! He's out!' It's all good. We've got a lot of things going on.” Olyphant started the episode laughing that The Hollywood Reporter would write up a news item about his butt double on Stick, but turns out he was sitting on a much more juicy piece of info!

With two of her three HGTV shows canceled in the last 12 months, Christina Haack is focusing on the future with a trip to France, where she's working with a vineyard to launch her dream business — a new champagne line launching in the fall. 

On July 30, 2025, the interior designer shared in her Instagram Stories that she was in Los Angeles, waiting for a passport replacement after losing hers. Two days later, on August 1, she was happily in Paris with her beau, business executive Chris Larocca, and her 14-year-old daughter Taylor, whom she shares with first husband and fellow HGTV star Tarek El Moussa. 

Their trip has included luxury shopping, dining and a trip to the vineyard in Reims — about two hours northwest of Paris — to see the progress being made on her Clé Cachée champagne, which is set to launch in the U.S. on September 29. 

A post shared by Clé Cachée (@clecacheechampagne)

Haack soaked up quality time in Paris with Larocca and her mini-me, Taylor, posting photos of their trip in her Instagram Stories. On August 1, she shared a pic of Taylor in sunglasses and a gold Dior necklace sitting at Carette Paris with a croissant, fresh fruit, and a mug of coffee or hot chocolate on the table in front of her. 

“Made it to the infamous @caretteofficiel,” Haack wrote over the photo. 

Later that day, she posted photos of herself and Larocca at Mondaine la Pariso, with him dressed head-to-toe in black and her wearing a black mini dress, and wrote, “Favorite restaurant in Paris ❤️”

That night, she shared a photo that Larocca posted in his Stories, of them kissing by the River Seine, with the Eiffel Tower illuminated behind them. She captioned the photo, “Best 48 hours in Paris…”

On August 2, they were off to the Grand Cru region of France, where she posted a photo of a vineyard and wrote, “Checking on production.” 

The website for Clé Cachée, which means “hidden key” in French, says, “Inspired by many visits to champagne houses throughout France, Christina has partnered with a vineyard and winemaker nestled amongst the Grand Cru vineyards near Epernay to create her own champagne collection. Grand Cru vineyards are known for producing the highest quality Champagne grapes in all of France.” 

On another photo of many champagne bottles on their sides, Haack wrote “disgorged.” According to Gifford's Guide, disgorgement is part of the process of champagne production, in which dead yeast deposits from “secondary fermentation” are removed. 

Haack also posted a pic of her and Larocca taste-testing her champagne and another that showed she was bringing several bottles home with her in a special carrying case. 

Haack confirmed in January that her Nashville-based show “Christina in the Country” would not return after two seasons. The decision came following her July 2024 split from third husband Josh Hall, who was featured prominently in the show, as was the second home she purchased there. 

With Hall staying in Tennessee and her staying in Orange County, California, she said on Jeff Lewis' SiriusXM Radio show of her series, “That's over. That was two seasons.”

In a bigger surprise on July 15, it was revealed that HGTV has also canceled her California-based series, “Christina on the Coast,” after five seasons. The series is one of multiple that have not been renewed by HGTV, including “The Flipping El Moussas,” starring her ex and his second wife, Heather Rae El Moussa.

Although an inside source told Us Weekly that “Christina on the Coast” and “The Flipping El Moussas” won't be renewed at HGTV, Heather told the outlet on July 30 that she and Tarek had not received word from the network on that show or on “The Flip Off,” which was a hit for them and Haack in early 2025. 

“I do know the fans would love to see it back and all three of us would love to see it back,” she told Us Weekly, noting she and Haack might team up for a second round. “We will definitely throw that idea around if season 2 comes about. But I love my partners and my husband.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Fans Flood Metallica Post With Love for James Hetfield","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/metallica-fans-birthday-love-james-hetfield/","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:04:03 GMT","

Legendary band Metallica didn't need a flashy video montage or an essay-length caption to honor James Hetfield's birthday. All it took was a moody green-hued photo of him mid-guitar shred with glowing lights behind him and a few bold words in matching green text saying, “Happy Birthday, James,” which was echoed in the caption.

That was all fans needed. The comments section exploded faster than a double bass solo. Thousands of birthday wishes rolled in; and some of them hit just as hard as Metallica's opening chords.

Yep, someone actually called him that, saying “Happy Birthday to the king of American Metal.” And well… they're not wrong.

A post shared by Metallica (@metallica)

The post quickly turned into a digital shrine of appreciation for the frontman who's been melting faces and inspiring generations since the early '80s. One fan added a simple, “Congratulations to your Birthday, dear James!💛🤘🏼🖤.”

Although there were a ton of birthday wishes, it wasn't all just basic shoutouts. A handful of fans went straight for the heartstrings. An emotional comment read: “Happy Birthday to my biggest idol, my hero, my biggest inspiration to never give up, James🤘 @metallica ❤️❤️❤️❤️.” Another said, “Happy birthday James!!!! You are the reason I picked up the guitar and wanted to play at a young age. Thank you so much !!!”

And, yes, this legend gets birthday love in multiple languages. A fan summed it all up with one perfect line in German: “Du hast Rock im Herzen.” Translation? “You have rock in your heart.” Chills.

Let's get real: James Hetfield isn't just Metallica's lead singer. He is Metallica's soul. The guy's voice could punch through concrete, his guitar riffs are the stuff of legends, and his presence on stage? Still electric. If Hetfield rocked too hard, he'd probably cause a minor earthquake; and fans would thank him for it.

Whether you've been blasting “Master of Puppets” since cassette tapes were a thing or just found your way into the fandom thanks to “Stranger Things,” chances are Hetfield's had an impact on you.

And judging by the sea of green hearts, devil horns, and emotional tributes under that post, it's clear fans aren't just here for the music… they're here for him.

No matter how many years go by or how many trends come and go, Hetfield's still the reason so many people picked up a guitar, got through hard times, or simply fell in love with metal. And on his birthday? The fans made sure he knew it.

The iconic (and often-memed) fight scene from “Marriage Story” is now being used by the U.S. government to save animals. 

Noah Baumbach's Academy Award-winning 2019 film stars Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver as a couple enduring a divorce; the pivotal climax amid their custody battle includes Driver's character punching a wall. Both Johansson and Driver earned Oscar nominations for their respective performances.

The Wall Street Journal reported that six years after the film was released, the United States Department of Agriculture selected the audio of the scene in question to scare off wolves from killing cattle and livestock on farms across America. The process is wolf hazing, and loud music such as “Thunderstruck” by AC/DC is used to do it. Now, also “Marriage Story.”

“Riding to the rescue are drone cowhands, whose quadcopters have thermal cameras that can reveal any wolf lurking in the darkness and bathe it in a spotlight. A loudspeaker broadcasts alarming sounds like fireworks, gunshots, and people arguing. One recording is of the fight between Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver in the movie ‘Marriage Story,'” the WSJ reads.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






An Oregon-based USDA district supervisor told the outlet, “I need the wolves to respond and know that, hey, humans are bad.” The best example of humans being bad, apparently, is Johansson and Driver yelling while in character. 

IndieWire has reached out to Netflix to confirm whether the snippet was licensed by the USDA. 

Johansson's voice has been at the center of a slew of projects, including even a possible lawsuit. Johansson famously lent her voice to Spike Jonze's “Her” to play a sentient AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman later asked the actress/director to voice ChatGPT Sky; after she declined, Johansson alleged that her voice was mimicked by the company instead.

“When I heard the released demo, I was shocked, angered, and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference,” Johansson said in a statement. “In a time when we are all grappling with deepfakes and the protection of our own likeness, our own work, our own identities, I believe these are questions that deserve absolute clarity,” Johansson continued. “I look forward to resolution in the form of transparency and the passage of appropriate legislation to help ensure that individual rights are protected.”

 










OpenAI CEO Altman denied the claims, saying, “The voice of Sky is not Scarlett Johansson's, and it was never intended to resemble hers. We cast the voice actor behind Sky's voice before any outreach to Ms. Johansson. Out of respect for Ms. Johansson, we have paused using Sky's voice in our products. We are sorry to Ms. Johansson that we didn't communicate better.”

A company statement also read: “We believe that AI voices should not deliberately mimic a celebrity's distinctive voice — Sky's voice is not an imitation of Scarlett Johansson but belongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice. To protect their privacy, we cannot share the names of our voice talents.”

A year after “The Substance” made a splash at Cannes and swept awards season, star Margaret Qualley has reflected on why the project was something of “a nightmare” for her.

In the film, Qualley played Sue, the younger version of aging actress Elizabeth (Demi Moore), who battles to take the (literal) spotlight from her spawn. The sci-fi film landed Moore an array of Best Actress nods, including a nomination at the Oscars.

Qualley told Cosmopolitan that “The Substance” made her confront “generations of trauma” within her own family. Qualley's mother is fellow actress Andie MacDowell, who actually counts Moore as another former co-star (the duo were in “St. Elmo's Fire” together).

“'The Substance' was like entering the eye of the storm. It was like dealing with all of my shit, my mom's shit, generations of trauma,” Qualley said. “It was a nightmare, being this idyllic, youthful fembot. No one thinks of themselves like that. The movie is not a good touchstone for what femininity is — it is quite masculine in a lot of ways.” 

 










She continued, “The thing I'll take home with me, for sure, is Demi Moore. She's such a special person. She's strong and she's wise, but she's also incredibly soft and porous. … I learned so much from her. She's become one of my dearest friends.”

Qualley's Cosmopolitan cover also nods to the film's themes: MacDowell was featured on the cover of Cosmopolitan's September 1982 issue, and now Qualley is on the Fall 2025 cover for the 60th anniversary issue.

Qualley also spoke about her latest role in “Honey Don't!,” which reunites her with “Drive-Away Dolls” filmmakers Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke. Qualley plays a queer detective investigating a cult in the dark comedy. “I trust any girl to be able to solve a fucking murder mystery with Instagram, to be honest. But my character is very confident and talkative. She's not a woman of few words. I think that sometimes I've made myself comfortable by knocking myself down. She's the opposite of that,” Qualley said. “She's in her power and smart and sexy. She's a bit like a cool-guy player.”

Qualley additionally stars in “Happy Gilmore 2,” “Blue Moon” (which she told IndieWire was “life-changing”), and “Huntington” this season.

Avant Gardner LLC, the operator of an entertainment complex that includes New York's beleaguered Brooklyn Mirage, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Billboard reports and documents confirm. The company, which also runs Great Hall and Kings Hall, had planned to reopen Brooklyn Mirage in May after a remodeling, but the scheduled shows have all been canceled as Avant Gardner struggles to secure the necessary permits to open. Though Great Hall and Kings Hall will stay open during the bankruptcy process, Avant Gardner's lender will now assume possession of the company's assets through a debtor-in-possession financing commitment, and the future of the Mirage is uncertain.

As the planned reopening stalled, Josh Wyatt, who was appointed Avant Gardner's chief executive officer last October, was replaced by the board's non-executive chairman, Gary Richards. He told Billboard, “I believe this Chapter 11 restructuring is the most viable path forward—it will allow us to stabilize Avant Gardner and focus on building for the future.”

Leonardo “Flaco” Jiménez, the singer, songwriter, and master accordionist, has died. Across a career spanning over 70 years, which included collaborations with Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, and many others, Jiménez helped to popularize the Mexican music birthed in his native South Texas alternatively called conjunto, norteño, or Tejano, though Jiménez often preferred to label it Tex-Mex. No cause of death was given in the Facebook post from Jimenéz's family announcing his death. He was 86 years old.

Born in San Antonio, Texas, Jiménez came from a lineage of accordionists, including his grandfather, Patricio, and father, Santiago Jiménez Sr. A pioneer of conjunto who injected his sound with accordion melodies inspired by the German and Czech polkas and waltzes he heard at dance halls in South and Central Texas, Santiago did not need to teach his son how to play the instrument; instead, the younger Jiménez learned the instrument himself at age seven simply from hearing his father play. “I was self-taught,” Jiménez explained to NPR in 2014. “You know, I used to watch my dad play at home and feeling the instrument—not just playing it, but feeling it, you know.” He quickly earned the nickname “Flaco,” or “Skinny,” the same moniker that his father used when he began playing music.

Jiménez's unmatched exuberance and skill on the accordion made him a fast-rising star in his native Texas. He was a regular in the dirt-floor dance hall scenes of cities and towns in the 1960s across the state, and he eventually paired up with Douglas Sahm, the founding member of the Sir Douglas Quintet and a key artistic collaborator; the pair would go on to found the Texas Tornados, a conjunto supergroup that recorded seven albums. In 1973, Sahm recruited Jiménez to contribute to his Doug Sahm and Band album, where he brushed shoulders with luminaries like Bob Dylan and Dr. John, paving the way for Jiménez's own breakthrough. “Doug told me ‘you're not supposed to play just that simple, traditional conjunto music,'” he said in a 2000 interview. “There are so many players who stayed in the same crater like my papa did. Doug showed me there were other worlds out there.”

Over the following decades, Jiménez brought his expressive accordion playing to collaborations with the Rolling Stones, Linda Rondstadt, Dwight Yoakam, and Ry Cooder, among many others. He released over 25 studio albums of his own and received six Grammy Awards in his lifetime, including trophies for Best Country Instrumental Album, in 1996, and the inaugural Best Tejano Music Performance, for 1998's Said and Done. “I started making conjunto more progressive because of the versatility that I believe in,” Jiménez said in an interview for PBS' American Roots. “I think it's good to change it a little.”

Jiménez was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Grammys in 2015 following his final album, 2014's Flaco Jiménez y Tomas Ortíz de los Alegres de Terán. “You must remember that when my papa played, there weren't record companies out there willing to expose conjunto music,“ he once said. “They considered it low class, cantina music, Mexican hillbilly music.… It was just among Mexicanos. I would consider myself one of the first ones who started sharing cultures.”

	President Donald Trump is thrilled about Sydney Sweeney's “great jeans” — and the revelation that the Emmy-nominated actor is a registered Republican. 


	“Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST' ad out there. It's for American Eagle, and the jeans are ‘flying off the shelves.' Go get ‘em Sydney!” Trump wrote Monday on Truth Social. Trump seemingly became aware of the growing debacle surrounding Sweeney and her controversial American Eagle denim campaign on Sunday. During a press gaggle with reporters Trump was asked about reports that Sweeney was a registered Republican. 


	“She's a registered Republican?” Trump said, “Oh, now I love her ad.”


	“You'd be surprised at how many people are Republicans,” he added. “That's what I wouldn't have known, but I'm glad you told me that. If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.”

	Trump paired his praise for Sweeney on Monday with a blond American icon he isn't as big of a fan of: Taylor Swift, whose support for Democrats the president has never been able to forgive. 

	











	“Just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift. Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can't stand her (HATE!). She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT. The tide has seriously turned — Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be,” the president wrote. 


	Taylor Swift was not, in fact, “booed out of the Super Bowl,” and remains one of the most successful artists on the planet despite the bizarre Republican vendetta against her. 

	











	If Swift and Sweeney have anything in common, it's far-right men projecting white nationalist values onto their public image. Sweeney's partnership with American Eagle used the tagline “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Genes Jeans,” leaning on the homophone to emphasize the well-worn point that Sweeney is hot, in jeans or otherwise. 


	“Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color. My jeans are blue,” the actor said in one ad. The general tone of the campaign — a blond, blue-eyed woman celebrating how great her  “genes” are — prompted laudatory reactions from online racists, and criticism from the left.

	Republicans have since taken to categorizing criticism of the advertisement as woke hysteria. “So you have a pretty girl doing a jeans ad and they can't help but freak out. It reveals a lot more about them than it does us. No question,” Vice President J.D. Vance said on Friday. 


	Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly said on her podcast: “We miss attractive people. We're sick of trying to pretend that these objectively unattractive people are the new beauty standard. … We're sick and fucking tired of the nonsense where you're not allowed to ever celebrate someone who is white and blond and blue-eyed.”

	Neither American Eagle or a representative for Sweeney responded to requests for comment regarding the president's statements. In an Instagram post published Friday, American Eagle wrote that “'Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans' is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone.” 


	The president agrees, at least when it comes to how they look on Republicans.

	Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove Democratic members of the state legislature from their offices and charge them with felonies after they fled the state. Two dozen Texas Democrats traveled to Chicago, Illinois, on Sunday to deny the Republican–controlled legislature the quorum it needs to pass an off-cycle redistricting measure aimed at securing Republicans additional seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. 


	“The derelict Democrat House members must return to Texas and be in attendance


	when the House reconvenes at 3:00 PM on Monday, August 4, 2025,” Abbott wrote in a letter issued on Sunday. “For any member who fails to do so, I will invoke Texas Attorney General Opinion No. KP-0382 to remove the missing Democrats from membership in the Texas House.” 


	That same afternoon, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton threatened to have the lawmakers arrested. “Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately. We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law,” he wrote on X.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Abbott added the potential of felony charges to his own ultimatum, writing that Democrats who solicited or accepted donations to help cover fines incurred by their absence may have committed felonies, and “violated bribery laws” 


	“The same could be true for any other person who ‘offers, confers, or agrees to confer' such funds to fleeing Democrat House members. I will use my full extradition authority to demand the return to Texas of any potential out-of-state felons,” Abbott wrote. 

	











	Democrats responded with a succinct challenge to the governor: “Come and take it.” 


	Abbott's threat against those who aid the missing Democrats is a barely veiled challenge to Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a billionaire who has announced he will be providing lodging and other logistical support for the group during their time in Chicago.

	“Donald Trump is trying to cheat the system in Texas, but these Democratic legislators refuse to let it happen without a fight,” Pritzker wrote in a post on X. “Their fight is our fight. I'm proud to stand side-by-side with them as they protect their constituents.” 


	“They're here in Illinois. We're going to do everything we can to protect every single one of them and make sure that — because we know they're doing the right thing — we know that they're following the law,” Pritzker added. “It's Ken Paxton who doesn't follow the law. It's the leaders of Texas who are attempting not to follow the law.”

	Trump has supported Texas Republicans redrawing the congressional map to squeeze out Democrats ahead of the 2026 midterms, and Democrats in Congress have been urging their colleagues in the state legislature to block the effort. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) visited Texas last week, and California Governor Gavin Newsom and New York Governor Kathy Hochul have met with Texas Democrats and indicated their states could respond with redistricting efforts of their own.


	“This will have implications, not just in Texas, but for our entire nation and its future,” Hochul said at a press conference Monday, alongside some of the Texas Democrats who fled the state. “The gloves are off, and I say, bring it on.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","Stephen Hawking's chilling warning about aliens and UFOs resurfaces amid US UFO probe","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/science/stephen-hawkings-chilling-warning-aliens-35668185","Mon, 04 Aug 2025 03:05:00 GMT","

Whilst worldwide intrigue surrounding UFOs and extraterrestrial life continues to escalate, renowned physicist Stephen Hawking consistently advocated for restraint, contending that mankind's enthusiasm to establish contact with alien civilisations could prove catastrophic.

During the period before his passing in 2018, Hawking persistently cautioned that any intentional effort to communicate with extraterrestrial beings, particularly those potentially far superior to our own species, might jeopardise humanity's survival.

His concern centred on the possibility that rather than approaching us with inquisitiveness or goodwill, a supremely intelligent alien race might view Earth as a world ready for plunder.

""If aliens ever visit us,"" Hawking said in a 2010 episode of Into the Universe, ""the outcome might be similar to when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans.""

Hawking argued it would be foolish to presume that sophisticated civilisations would inherently embrace peace, reports the Express US.

If anything, humanity's historical patterns, particularly when dominant societies encounter less developed cultures, indicate that domination, settlement, or disregard for suffering are equally probable as negotiation.

Hawking theorised that alien societies with interstellar travel capabilities would probably have depleted their homeworld's natural resources, driving them to traverse the cosmos seeking fresh planets to colonise or mine for raw materials.

Under these circumstances, Earth might be perceived as a viable conquest rather than an ally. Despite championing the hunt for intelligent life beyond our planet, Hawking drew a firm distinction between listening and making contact.

Whilst initiatives like Breakthrough Listen, which earned Hawking's backing, focus on picking up alien transmissions, other programmes including Breakthrough Message and METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence) advocate actively broadcasting messages into the cosmos to announce our existence to other civilisations.

Hawking staunchly rejected these approaches. From his perspective, passive monitoring was scientifically sound, but broadcasting our whereabouts to mysterious galactic neighbours was recklessly foolish.

""We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet,"" he cautioned.

This warning has resurfaced lately following heightened public and governmental focus on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs, the military designation for UFOs).

American authorities have released classified military footage of mysterious airborne objects, whilst parliamentary sessions have spotlighted whistleblower allegations regarding possible non-human intelligence.

Although numerous researchers continue to doubt these encounters involve extraterrestrial visitors, public fascination has been rekindled, alongside fresh interest in Hawking's viewpoint. Detractors of active messaging contend that we simply can't predict the ethics, objectives, or behaviours of extraterrestrial beings.

Even if intelligent aliens are aware of our planet, making ourselves known could provoke a response, positive or negative, that we're ill-equipped to manage.

Stephen Hawking wasn't alone in his apprehension. Notable figures such as physicist Michio Kaku and SETI pioneer Frank Drake have voiced their ambivalence towards interstellar communication.

The late Carl Sagan, though generally more hopeful, also underscored the need for caution, pointing out the unpredictability of alien psychology.

Despite these cautionary words, some scientists argue that maintaining silence is neither practical nor beneficial. Given that Earth has been emitting radio waves into space for over a century, technologically advanced civilisations may already be aware of our existence.

From this perspective, intentional messaging might not make much of a difference.

Comedian Matt Rife said he and YouTuber Elton Castee are now the legal guardians of Annabelle, the doll that famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren said was possessed by an evil spirit. 

""We are the legal guardians and caretakers of all 750 haunted artifacts and items in the Warren Museum, including the Annabelle doll. I must go on record and say we do not legally own items, but we are the legal guardians and caretakers of the items for at least the next five years,” Rife said in an Instagram video on Saturday. 

Rife, 29, announced in an Instagram post on Friday that he and Castee, 35, had purchased the Warrens' home and museum in Monroe, Connecticut, which includes their entire haunted collection of dolls and artifacts. 

Tony Spera, the Warrens' son-in-law and co-director of the late couple's organization, New England Society for Psychic Research, clarified to TODAY.com that he and his wife still own the Warrens' collection, including the Annabelle doll, and are only leasing them to Rife and Castee. 

""We have no plans to ever 'sell' the artifacts,"" he said in a statement. 

Ed and Lorraine Warren's paranormal investigations were turned into the horror movies ""The Conjuring,"" ""Annabelle"" and ""The Nun."" Actors Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play Ed and Lorraine in the franchise. 

""The Conjuring: Last Rites"" is the latest film in the series and will be released in September. 

""If you know me, you know I'm obsessed with the paranormal and all things haunted,"" Rife captioned a photo of himself and Castee posing with the doll. ""You also may know The Conjuring films are my favorite scary movies of all time. So I'm incredibly honored to have taken over one of the most prominent properties in paranormal history. Ed and Lorain Warren arguably put demonology and paranormal into the mainstream and are the very heart of some of the most famous haunted stories of all time, The Conjuring House, Amityville Horror, et…"" 

Rife said they plan to open the house for ""overnight stays and museum tours."" 

His announcement came less than a month after paranormal investigator and Annabelle doll handler Dan Rivera died on the ""Devils on the Run Tour,"" which features the Annabelle doll. Rivera, 54, was found dead in a Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, hotel room on July 13. 

According to E! News, a July 16 police report labeled his death as ""natural,"" but a final cause of death won't be determined until an autopsy is completed. 

In the three standalone films about Annabelle, the doll is given as a gift to a nursing student who noticed strange occurrences with the doll. The nurse and her roommate call the Warrens, who pronounce the doll ""demonically possessed,"" remove it from the home and encase it ""in a glass box to contain the evil spirited entity,"" according to New England Society for Psychic Research. Ed Warren died in 2006 at 79, and Lorraine Warren died in 2019 at 92.

The New England Society for Psychic Research did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.

The search for alien life is largely centered on finding planets in the “Goldilocks Zone”—the distance from a star where a planet could have liquid water on its surface and enough light to sustain life. But a new study offers a tantalizing possibility that other worlds, far from their host stars, may also be able to support living things, a finding that could dramatically broaden the search for extraterrestrial life.

In a paper published last week in the International Journal of Astrobiology, researchers describe how cosmic rays—high-speed beams of particles pinging across the universe—could carry enough energy to sustain life. These rays can penetrate deep into the interior of planets far from their host stars, where they could strike underground reservoirs of water. The impact from the rays would split the water particles, releasing electrons in a process called radiolysis. 

Certain microbes that are known to survive in dark, cold environments on Earth sustain themselves using this mechanism. If alien life could survive on radiolysis, as the findings suggest, then astronomers may need to reevaluate what is considered the habitable zone.

Led by New York University Abu Dhabi's Center for Astrophysics and Space Science, the researchers ran computer simulations to determine how different levels of cosmic ray exposure might influence the surfaces of three cold bodies in our solar system: Mars, Enceladus (one of Saturn's moons), and Europa (a moon of Jupiter). 

Specifically, they wanted to see whether cosmic rays could trigger radiolysis there, and especially on the two moons, as astronomers have long believed they could have water below their icy surfaces.

The team found that Enceladus was the most promising candidate for sustaining life via radiolysis, although the simulations suggested that all three bodies could support some level of radiolysis, according to the paper. The researchers suggest that astronomers should expand what they think of as the habitable zone, dubbing this larger arena the Radiolytic Habitable Zone. 

“This discovery changes the way we think about where life might exist,” lead study author Dimitra Atri said in a statement. “Instead of looking only for warm planets with sunlight, we can now consider places that are cold and dark, as long as they have some water beneath the surface and are exposed to cosmic rays. Life might be able to survive in more places than we ever imagined,” he added.

In r/psychics, for instance, tmsaqer shared that he had a good experience with Keen psychics. On the other hand, this Redditor also said he couldn't speak for all the advisors on the platform since they have different skills and energy levels.

Another Reddit user, SpamZelda, praised one of the best Keen psychics she's tried as accurate, personal, intuitive, and thoughtful in an r/psychicreadings thread. On the flip side, she admitted she hasn't gone for a Keen psychic reading in a long time.

On Trustpilot, Keen gained an impressive 4.1 out of 5 rating based on over 780 Keen psychic reviews [1].

Sometimes, you must look seriously at the competition to understand just how good a service is. In the spirit of transparency, here are a pair of Keen's direct competitors that we feel are worthy of your consideration.

 

Both Purple Garden and Keen are great sites for phone and chat readings, but Purple Garden goes beyond this by offering video readings.

Purple Garden also provides a variety of readings in English and Spanish, such as dream analysis, palmistry, tarot sessions, oracle guidance, and angel insights.

While there are no free minutes on Purple Garden like Keen, its introductory offer comes in the form of $30 free credit for new clients. Better yet, the typical rates start as low as $0.99 per minute.

Reddit user DanielTea explained in r/psychics that her tarot session on Purple Garden felt more personal than similar readings she's had before. Although she noted there wasn't any satisfaction guarantee, she liked how there were more than 1,000 advisors available.

With over 30 years of online experience, Psychic Source was one of the original pioneers of the online psychic reading phenomenon. While it doesn't have nearly as many psychics as Keen, it carefully screens all its advisors, accepting only the top 2%.

Known for a wide variety of readings and a free articles section on everything psychic and spiritual, Psychic Source is another viable alternative to Keen.

Psychic Source features multiple $1 per minute introductory offers for 10, 20, or 30 minutes. As for the regular rates, these start at just $0.99 per minute.

As Redditor asmw9 said in r/psychics, Psychic Source is one of the few online psychic sites they recommend checking out, although they were initially skeptical at first.

A recent letter to the editor supporting Jillian Duclos' mayoral campaign accuses Mayor Gina-Louise Sciarra of ""pushing through unpopular programs at the behest of unaccountable private interests."" Meaning what, exactly? Which interests? (And is the Main Street redesign in fact unpopular? If any survey data exists, I can't find it). If you have specific, credible evidence of malfeasance by the mayor or anyone else, please bring it. If not, these insinuations amount to the kind of Trumpy rumor-mongering that serves only to increase the cynicism and political disengagement of the citizenry, and (not coincidentally) to provide cover for genuine, rampant corruption at the federal level.

Everyone is entitled to their opinion about Picture Main Street, but conspiracy theories and smear campaigns don't belong in any newspaper that purports to uphold the principles of journalism.

The EU will be unable to meet the commitments it made under a recent trade deal with the US, according to former EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. In an interview with EUObserver published Monday, Borrell questioned the bloc's capacity to purchase the promised volume of American natural gas.

Brussels and Washington finalized an agreement on July 28, concluding months of negotiations between US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The pact imposes a 15% tariff on most EU exports to the United States, while the bloc has agreed to buy $750 billion in US energy and invest $600 billion in the American economy over the next three years.

According to the Sunday Times report, von der Leyen “surrendered” to a lopsided US trade deal without resistance out of fear that Washington might reduce military support for Ukraine or even withdraw American forces from Europe.

Importing such an amount of gas is “simply not feasible,” Borrell said, adding that “the EU doesn't buy gas, companies do.” He also warned that the deal contradicts the bloc's domestic goals.

”We say we want our own defense industry while promising to buy everything from the US,” the former EC vice president noted. “The same as claiming we have a green strategy while tripling gas purchases.”

Borrell argued that the agreement reflects a flawed strategy, calling it more of a surrender than a negotiation. He suggested the deal makes the EU appear weak and overly submissive to Trump's demands. According to him, Brussels is “selling the deal as the least bad option.”

“The US threatened 30% tariffs, then offered 15%, and we're expected to be grateful,” he said, calling the deal an example of “the old strategy of bullies.”

Borrell is not alone in his criticism. Several other European officials have slammed von der Leyen over the perceived imbalance of the agreement.

Veteran French politician Marine Le Pen labeled the deal a “fiasco.” French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly voiced dissatisfaction with the outcome, saying the EU is “not feared enough.”

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has accused von der Leyen of overstepping her authority by allegedly committing the bloc to large-scale US arms purchases, saying that Trump “ate her for breakfast.”

Prime Minister Mark Carney, left, meets with U.S. President Donald Trump, right, in the Oval Office at the White House on May 6. The U.S. has imposed a 35-per-cent tariff on Canadian goods that are not USMCA-compliant.Leah Millis/Reuters

Where do things stand for Canada after the United States imposed a new, higher tariff last Thursday evening?

In the short run, not much has changed. In the long run, a lot may yet change. 

Since the signing of the landmark Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement in 1988, the relationship has been about ever-lower trade barriers and ever-easier movement of goods and services across the border. It was part of a global trend.

Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. is reversing course, hard and fast. 

The average American tariff on imports from all countries was 17.3 per cent on Aug. 1, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. That's more than seven times higher – yes, you read that right – than at the start of the year. The last time U.S. taxes on imports were this high was 1934.

Those who say that Mr. Trump is delivering TACOs – “Trump Always Chickens Out” – are missing the real story. It's true that the President has consistently done less than threatened. But extreme threats have conditioned both U.S. public opinion and foreign governments to accept the previously unimaginable. The result is that the U.S. suddenly has high tariff walls. 

Last month, the European Union, Japan and South Korea all agreed to the U.S. slapping a 15-per-cent tariff on most of their exports. They also promised not to retaliate. 

Olivier Blanchard, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, published a poem on the social media that describes Mr. Trump's negotiating technique, and the EU's response: 

“I am going to cut your arm.

Please do not, please, please

Ok, I shall be generous, and just cut your thumb.

Thank you, thank you. You are so generous.""

Only two countries have retaliated: China and Canada.

Mr. Trump has already delivered the biggest change to the global economic order since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and there is more to come. That's the context in which Canada is trying to negotiate with Washington. 

Prime Minister Mark Carney appears to be attempting to preserve as much as possible of the free-trade relationship with the U.S., while laying the groundwork for a future in which Canada has no choice but to trade less with the U.S.

The Trump administration's goal is to force the rest of the world to sell less to the U.S., which it believes will lead to far more domestic U.S. production. In accepting a 15-per-cent U.S. tariff, Japan, South Korea and the EU all effectively agreed to this. Britain did likewise, accepting a 10-per-cent tariff. 

What ultimate level of import duties Mr. Trump hopes to impose on Canada, covering what basket of goods, remains unclear.

However, Mr. Carney has signalled that any deal with the U.S. could include a baseline tariff, as Japan, South Korea and the EU agreed to. He also implied that Canada might have to offer commitments to buy U.S. goods or make investments in the U.S., as those other trading partners did, though the terms of their promises are vague and possibly meaningless.

LeBlanc says Trump, Carney to speak in coming days following tariff announcement

Canada's ace in the hole has been the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement. The 35-per-cent tariff that Mr. Trump slapped on Canada on Thursday night – up from the 25-per-cent rate imposed earlier this year – only applies to goods that are not USMCA-compliant. The Bank of Canada last week estimated that 100 per cent of Canadian energy exports, and 95 per cent of everything else, is covered by the USMCA. The whopping 35-per-cent tariff only applies to less than 5 per cent of our exports.

However, several Canadian industries are subject to sectoral tariffs, including a 50-per-cent levy on steel and aluminum, a 25-per-cent tariff on cars, and new duties on lumber. These hit hard because Canada is a major exporter of these goods, and our auto industry is fully integrated with U.S. supply chains. To the extent that Canadian-made vehicles use American parts, they receive a reduction in the auto duty, but steel, aluminum and lumber get no such break.

Other U.S. trading partners, with the exception of Mexico, have no USMCA protections. 

Last Friday, Canada-U.S. Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc said talks will continue with the Americans, but that he was leaving Washington after a long period of intense negotiations, and that no progress was likely in the coming days.

Canada has breathing room because of the USMCA, and so does Mexico. It got a 90-day extension on negotiations, with no new tariffs, on the same day as Canada was hit with the 35-per-cent levy.

The USMCA has allowed Ottawa to rag the puck, and to avoid caving in to Washington's demands as quickly as other trading partners. Time may work in Canada's favour. The 35-per-cent tariff, whose legal excuse is that Canada is flooding the U.S. with fentanyl, is likely to be struck down by the U.S. courts, though that won't happen quickly. Negative economic news – a small helping of which arrived last week – could lead the American public and business to push back more forcefully against Mr. Trump's tariff plans.

The USMCA has been a shield for Canada, but it is up for renegotiation next year. Mr. Trump could also walk away with six months notice.

The Canadian economy is holding up, but there are many unknowns: Does Trumpenomics' vision for the future include a North American trading bloc, with Canada benefiting from lower tariffs than the rest of the world? Or does Mr. Trump want to subject Canada to the same tariffs as the rest of the world, which would sever continental automobile supply chains, while reducing most other exports? 

We are about to find out.

Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says he will begin trying to remove Democratic lawmakers from office Monday if they don't return after dozens of them left the state in a last-resort attempt to block redrawn U.S. House maps that President Donald Trump wants before the 2026 midterm elections.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Democrats on Monday prevented their state's House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump to shore up Republicans' 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters.

After dozens of Democrats left the state, the Republican-dominated House was unable to establish the quorum of lawmakers required to do business. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has made threats about removing some members of the opposition from their seats.

Democrats have countered that Abbott is using “smoke and mirrors” to assert legal authority he does not have.

The Republican-dominated House issued civil arrest warrants intended to compel the return of absent members, but it was not immediately clearly whether those can or will be enforced beyond Texas borders.

House Speaker Rep. Dustin Burrows urged Democrats to return to “fulfill your duty.”

“If you continue to go down this road, there will be consequences,” he said.

The Democratic revolt and Abbott's threats ratcheted up a widening fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but expanded to include Democratic governors who have floated the possibility of rushing to redraw their own state maps in retaliation, even if their options are limited. The dispute also offers another example of Trump's aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the longstanding balance of powers among the federal government and individual states.




At the center of the escalating impasse is Trump's hope of adding five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas before the 2026 midterm elections. That would bolster his party's chances of preserving its slim U.S. House majority, as Republicans were unable to do in the 2018 midterms during Trump's first presidency. Republicans currently hold 25 of Texas' 38 seats.

Speaking Monday on Fox News, Abbott essentially admitted to the partisan power play, noting that the U.S. Supreme Court has determined “there is nothing illegal” about shaping districts to a majority party's advantage. He even openly acknowledged it as “gerrymandering” before correcting himself to say Texas is “drawing lines.”

More than 1,800 miles away from Austin, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul appeared with Texas Democrats and argued that their cause should be national.

“We're not going to tolerate our democracy being stolen in a modern-day stagecoach heist by bunch of law breaking cowboys,” Hochul said Monday, flanked by several of the lawmakers who left Texas. “If Republicans are willing to rewrite rules to give themselves an advantage, then they're leaving us with no choice: We must do the same. You have to fight fire with fire.”

Abbott insisted ahead of the scheduled session that lawmakers have “absconded” in violation of their sworn duties to the state.

“I believe they have forfeited their seats in the state Legislature because they are not doing the job they were elected to do,” he said in the Fox News interview, invoking his state's hallmark machismo to call the lawmakers “un-Texan.”

“Texans don't run from a fight,” he said.

Democrats said they had no plans to heed the governor's demands to return.

“He has no legal mechanism,” said Texas Rep. Jolanda Jones, one of the lawmakers who was in New York on Monday. “Subpoenas from Texas don't work in New York, so he can't come and get us. Subpoenas in Texas don't work in Chicago. ... He's putting up smoke and mirrors.”

A refusal by Texas lawmakers to show up is a civil violation of legislative rules. As for his threat to remove the lawmakers, Abbott cited a nonbinding legal opinion issued by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton amid an partisan quorum dispute in 2021. Paxton suggested a court could determine that a legislator had forfeited their office.

Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, said on X that Democrats who “try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately.”

The lawmakers who left declined to say how long they will hold out.

“The magic of a quorum break is you never telegraph the how long or what you're going to do,” said Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, who has served in the Legislature since 2001. “We recognized when we got on the plane that we're in this for the long haul.”

Texas House Democratic Caucus leader Gene Wu said his members “will do whatever it takes” but added, “What that looks like, we don't know.”

Legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, including in 2021 when many of the same Texas House Democrats left the state for 38 days to protest new voting restrictions. Once they returned, Republicans still passed that measure.

Lawmakers cannot pass bills in the 150-member Texas House without at least two-thirds of them present. Democrats hold 62 of the seats in the majority-Republican chamber, and at least 51 left the state, said Josh Rush Nisenson, spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus. 

The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to “physically compel the attendance” of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served. Republicans answered by adopting $500 daily fines for lawmakers who don't show up for work as punishment.

The governor, meanwhile, continues to make unsubstantiated claims that some lawmakers have committed felonies by soliciting money to pay for fines they could face for leaving the state to deny a quorum.

The lack of a quorum will delay votes on disaster assistance and new warning systems in the wake of last month's catastrophic floods in Texas that killed at least 136 people. Democrats had called for votes on the flooding response before taking up redistricting and have criticized Republicans for not doing so.

On Fox, Abbott attempted to turn that issue back on Democrats, suggesting their efforts to break a quorum would become the reason for a delayed flood response.

Beyond Texas, some Democrats wants to leverage the fight.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential contender and outspoken Trump critic, welcomed Texas Democrats on Sunday after having been in quiet talks with them for weeks. Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, another potential 2028 contender, held public events about the Texas fight before the quorum break. 

“This is not just rigging the system in Texas,” Pritzker said Sunday night. “It's about rigging the system against the rights of all Americans for years to come.”

Holger Rune is not afraid of making some surprise choices throughout his career on the ATP Tour. 

Rune surprised many by working with Andre Agassi, the former world number one who helped give him some pointers.

The Dane has suffered some disappointing defeats recently, but Rune still believes he is not far away from Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.

Although he was able to win a couple of matches at the Canadian Open, Rune was then beaten in the fourth round by Alexei Popyrin.

Popyrin was not on Rune's list of the nicest players on the ATP Tour, but another Australian did make an appearance.

In a Tik Tok video for Overtime Tennis, Rune and other players on the ATP Tour were asked for the five players that they think are the nicest.

Rune agreed with both Daniil Medvedev and Francisco Cerundolo, the latter who he actually picked, by naming Alcaraz.

The world number nine also chose Gael Monfils and Ben Shelton, but the fifth player he named may come as a surprise to some.

Nick Kyrgios has been involved in spats with fellow ATP players before, but Rune claimed that he has always been nice to him. 

“Carlos Alcaraz, very nice guy,” began Rune. “Gael Monfils, unbelievable guy. I think Cerundolo, Francisco. He is a very nice guy.

“With me Nick Kyrgios, he is a very nice guy with me! Ben Shelton he's a good lad.”

It does not appear that this friendship is one-sided, with Kyrgios also recently complimenting Rune for something he recently said.

Rune received heavy criticism at Wimbledon this year for claiming that he would have beaten his opponent, Nicolas Jarry, nine times out of ten in ‘normal conditions' after claiming he had a knee injury.

Despite the widespread backlash, Kyrgios admitted he actually liked what Rune said and could see himself in the 22-year-old.

“My villain of the week is Holger [Rune],” Kyrgios said last month. “I just love that comment, straight away saying that he would beat [Nicolas] Jarry nine times out of ten.

“That is like the cockiest comment ever but I like it. That is something I would have said in my press conferences. 

“That is why I do like Holger. I do like that, and that has stirred up the media a little bit.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Keys' ""great day"" came as a result of some bold play when she needed it most deep in the two-hour, 20-minute match. She had previously failed to convert a 0-40 opportunity on Muchova's serve at 2-2 in the final set, and the Czech kept the pressure on by continuing to hold serve.After Keys' sixth double fault of the match gave Muchova 30-40, Keys walloped a first-ball forehand that kissed the sideline, and ran Muchova back to the next corner to wipe away the first opportunity. Six points later in the four-deuce game, she spun a first serve in facing the second match point, and a befuddled Muchova missed her return wide.From there, Keys won 10 of the last 12 points of the match to improve her head-to-head against Muchova to 2-0, though they last played in 2019.For a spot in the semifinals, Keys will face the winner of Sunday's first night match between No. 2 seed Swiatek or No. 16 seed Clara Tauson.

Ben Shelton may have accomplished a personal goal in his ATP Tour career by notching his 100th win Sunday at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers, but the American is giving his girlfriend's goal in the NWSL the day's top billing.

Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman returned to the pitch for the first time in nearly four months and powered home a late, winning goal against Portland Thorns FC after coming on as a substitute. The 2024 Olympic gold medalist was overcome with emotion in the celebrations, having struggled with a recurring back injury over the past year.

On Sunday evening, Shelton made a late move of his own to secure a 6-4, 4-6, 7-6(1) victory against Flavio Cobolli and reach the 100-wins milestone. After the match, he was asked which of the couple's moments stood out more.

""I think Trinity Rodman scoring a goal,"" he said without hesitation. ""One-year anniversary from her incredible goal at the Olympics, hadn't played in 100-something days and she goes in and in 15 minutes scores a banger. It's pretty cool, especially [because] she was emotional. I'm always happy for her.""

Rodman's goal came in an afternoon match at the Spirit's home field in Washington, D.C. Just last week, when Shelton reached the semi-finals at the Mubadala Citi DC Open in the U.S. capital, he remarked that Rodman was a bigger star than him in the city. Her star shined brightly on Sunday.

""Holy cow, that was just the hardest thing I've had to go through with injury and everything,"" Rodman said, as quoted on ESPN.com. ""So, being back with the team, especially at home, with the stadium and the crowd behind me, scoring a goal like that — you saw I buried it. I was not going to miss it. I'm just really happy to be back. I missed the team. I missed doing what I love.""



While the Spirit's next match is not until next Saturday, Shelton will return to action Tuesday in Toronto. Bidding to reach his first ATP Masters 1000 semi-final, Shelton will meet Alex de Minaur in a battle between Top 10 players in the PIF ATP Rankings.

Radio Rewind: 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Mark Hughes unpicks how Lando Norris managed to beat his team mate and title rival Oscar Piastri to Hungarian Grand Prix glory.

Hungarian Grand Prix winner Lando Norris succesfully used a one-stop strategy to score a narrow victory at the Hungaroring over two-stopping McLaren team mate – and title rival – Oscar Piastri.

But it was a choice made relatively late in the race and in the expectation it would clear Norris past George Russell's Mercedes for third place – not that it would put him in a winning position.

Norris had lost out to Russell and Fernando Alonso in the first couple of corners of the race start and fell to fifth, while Piastri chased Charles Leclerc's race-leading Ferrari. Although Norris re-passed Alonso easily enough, he could find no way by the Mercedes throughout Russell's 19-lap opening stint.

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

The McLaren duo nearly made contact in the closing laps but Lando Norris held on for victory.

Lando Norris claimed victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix, surviving massive late pressure from McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri in the closing stages.

The Briton secured the win having used a one-stop strategy in comparison to the two stops by his stablemate, and in the process he reduced Piastri's lead in the Drivers' Championship down to just nine points heading into the summer break.

George Russell completed the podium having made a late pass on Charles Leclerc, the Ferrari man dramatically slumping to fourth in the second half of the race having started from pole and leading the early stages.

Radio Rewind: 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix

2025 Hungarian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

George Russell gave the clearest indication yet that he will remain with Mercedes in 2026.

George Russell has confirmed it is a case of ""when not if"" he will sign a new contract keeping him at Mercedes for 2026 after weeks of speculation.

The Briton's future with the Silver Arrows has been one of the main talking points this season as rumours circulated that he could be replaced for next year by four-time World Champion, Max Verstappen.

Russell always maintained his future was with Mercedes, despite Team Principal Toto Wolff confirming that talks between himself and Verstappen had taken place.

At the Belgium Grand Prix, Wolff gave the clearest indiction yet that he would prefer to keep the current line-up of Russell and Kimi Antonelli, and ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix last weekend Verstappen confirmed he would be staying at Red Bull.

Russell claimed his sixth podium of the campaign in Hungary, and post-race confirmed his future with Mercedes would be sorted in the coming weeks but that he was in no rush.

""He [Toto Wolff] has got nothing to be worried about, I've got nothing to be worried about,"" Russell told Sky Sports F1.

""Nothing is going to happen over the summer because I just want to have a rest and recharge and come back stronger for the second half of the year but there's no time pressure either way. It will happen when it happens, it's a when not if.

""I'm 27 now, I've been with the team four years, next year would be my fifth and we want to build the relationship together but it's got to be right and I don't want to rush it. I've been waiting 12 months, I'm not going to just rush it in the course of two weeks so we'll sit down when the time is right.""

Russell finished third at the Hungaroring having held eventual race winner Lando Norris at bay in the early running before jumping on to the podium after a late pass on polesitter, Charles Leclerc.

While Russell admits that matching the McLarens over the remaining 10 races will be difficult, he believed Mercedes could be 'best of the rest'.

""I was quite happy to keep Lando at bay for the first stint,"" he said.

""Those guys are just doing an amazing job right now, they're head and shoulders above everyone, week in, week out, and I don't think that's going to change much in the second half of the year because everybody is focused on 2026. Our goal is best of the rest.""
