                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins - Verb Technology rebranded as TON Strategy Co. after securing $558M in private placement to pivot fully into crypto, focusing on Toncoin ($TON) as a publicly traded treasury reserve manager. - The firm plans to allocate most funds to acquire 5% of TON's circulating supply and generate 3-5% annual yields via staking, with 36% of shares locked for 6-12 months. - The move drove a 90% stock surge but faces risks from TON's volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and competition, while signaling growing institutional interest in TON's 1B-user ecosystem. - By leveraging its Nasdaq listing, TON Strategy Co. aims to bridge traditional finance and crypto markets, potentially accelerating digital assets' acceptance as a mainstream investment class. This transition is set to be finalized by August 7, 2025 [1]. Analysts suggest that if TON reaches $5–$7 per token by the end of 2025, the value of TON Strategy Co.'s treasury could appreciate by 40–100% [1]. The move reflects a broader trend of institutional interest in TON, a blockchain platform initially developed by Telegram and now supporting over 1 billion monthly users. TON serves as the primary payment rail for in-app purchases, NFTs, and mini-apps within the Telegram ecosystem, offering real-world utility beyond speculative trading [1]. This transition also highlights an attempt to bridge traditional finance and crypto markets by providing a regulated, transparent investment vehicle into the TON ecosystem [2]. Verb Technology, previously known for its interactive video-based sales platform, is shifting entirely into blockchain investment. This shift has already driven a 90% surge in its stock price following the announcement [2]. However, the firm faces challenges, including exposure to TON's price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and competition from private TON-focused funds. By leveraging its Nasdaq listing, TON Strategy Co. aims to establish credibility and liquidity in a rapidly evolving market [3].</p>

From sourcing raw materials to delivering finished goods, efficient and secure supply chain operations are vital for business success. Yet, many companies still rely on fragmented, opaque systems prone to inefficiencies, fraud and delays. Together, these technologies are driving a new era of business innovation. Building a Smart Supply Chain: The Role of Blockchain and ML An effective next-generation supply chain integrates blockchain's decentralized transparency with machine learning's predictive intelligence. Blockchain creates an immutable, time-stamped ledger of every transaction or movement in the supply chain. From the origin of raw materials to final delivery, each event is securely recorded and verified by network participants. If a product recall is needed, blockchain enables swift and accurate identification of affected batches, preventing broader contamination or financial loss. This predictive capability enables businesses to optimize demand forecasting, reduce waste and streamline inventory management.Retailers, for instance, can use ML to forecast sales spikes during holiday seasons and adjust inventory accordingly. Logistics providers can anticipate bottlenecks or delays and reroute shipments preemptively. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts automatically execute predefined actions when specific conditions are met. This automation also improves cash flow and accelerates the entire procurement cycle. Machine learning models are especially effective at detecting irregularities across large datasets. In a supply chain context, ML can flag unexpected delivery delays, unauthorized access to goods or anomalies in supplier performance.By combining anomaly detection with blockchain's secure audit trail, businesses gain both real-time insights and historical accountability. This layered approach improves risk mitigation, particularly in industries such as pharmaceuticals or aerospace where quality control is critical. Blockchain allows businesses to document every step in the supply chain, proving that materials are ethically sourced or environmentally sustainable.Machine learning can further help by identifying suppliers that meet sustainability criteria or predicting the environmental impact of different sourcing strategies. This transparency supports ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) goals while boosting brand reputation. Despite their transformative potential, integrating blockchain and ML into business operations is not without hurdles: High Initial Investment: Developing blockchain infrastructure and training ML models requires significant upfront costs which may deter smaller enterprises. Scalability and Interoperability: Blockchain networks must handle high transaction volumes without compromising speed. Likewise, ML models must be scalable and adaptable to changing data environments. To fully realize the benefits of blockchain and ML in supply chains, organizations must: The fusion of blockchain and machine learning represents a breakthrough in supply chain innovation. Together, these technologies are transforming how businesses manage their operations, mitigate risk and deliver value to customers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hiring in crypto is hard – Campus makes it easy. Billionaire Adam Weitsman, an investor and owner of a scrap metal processing company, said he bought over 5,000 NFTs from Yuga Labs, the web3 studio behind the once wildly-popular Bored Ape Yacht Club token collection. I'm making a long-term investment in Otherside and acquiring over 5,000 Otherdeeds, Mega Kodas and Weapon Kodas direct from Yuga Labs to continue building my collection," the entrepreneur posted to X on Monday, adding that he's also committed to "making a series of acquisitions on the open market this year." Amid a collapsed NFT market, Yuga Labs has, in recent months, been forced to sell prime brands like Moonbirds and CryptoPunks, collections that used to rank among the top in terms of trading volume. In March, DappRadar said trading volumes for the most popular NFT collections had declined by 95%. "I have recently seen Yuga refocus and prioritize [ [Otherside]. There is a lot riding on this project for the whole space and I will do my best to help make it a success for everyone," he wrote. When Otherside first launched in May 2022, the parcels of virtual land called "Otherdeeds" sold out within hours and netted Yuga Labs $317 million in sales. Almost immediately after, trading volume more or less flatlined, according to CryptoSlam data. The floor price for an Otherside Otherdeed was about $640 on Monday, according to OpenSea data. In late 2023, Yuga Labs' then-CEO said that after a company restructuring, the firm would focus on developing Otherside. "Otherside is a gamified, interoperable metaverse currently under development," according to the project's website. "The game blends mechanics from massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) and web3-enabled virtual worlds. Think of it as a metaRPG where the players own the world, your NFTs can become playable characters, and thousands can play together in real time." After tremendous fervor revolving around metaverse projects, principally launched by Meta, and web3 platforms like The Sandbox and Decentraland, metaverse-focused development effectively came to a halt when crypto prices fell amid a bearish cycle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BitMine (BMNR) says it now holds more Ethereum than any other company in the world. Chairman Tom Lee announced that the firm has built up a treasury of 833,000 ETH, worth around $3 billion at today's prices. BitMine says these holdings make it “the largest ETH treasury globally.” If true, it puts BitMine ahead of every major institution in crypto, including Coinbase (COIN) and even Grayscale (ETHE), whose ETH exposure is held through trust products, not corporate reserves. BitMine is saying, proudly, that it owns more of the actual asset than anyone else. BitMine originally made its name in crypto mining and infrastructure. According to Lee, the company started buying large amounts of ETH across OTC markets and strategic deals. The goal was simple: to build a long-term position while avoiding price impact. In a company release, Lee said BitMine moved with “lightning speed” in its ETH strategy and that the firm believes Ethereum represents the future of digital infrastructure. BitMine believes Ethereum's real-world usage gives it more upside than Bitcoin. This generates a steady yield while keeping the ETH locked and secure. The rest remains in cold storage, ready for future strategic use. For now, BitMine's claim of the world's largest ETH treasury stands. Unless another player steps forward with proof of a bigger stack, it looks like BitMine owns the crown.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ether's futures and options data signal neutral‑to‑bearish sentiment despite recent price recovery. Institutional ETF outflows and a lack of catalysts keep ETH from breaking $3,800. Ether (ETH) price has gained 9% from the $3,355 low on Sunday, yet derivatives metrics suggest traders are still not confident the bullish momentum will hold. Altcoin market capitalization reached $1.3 trillion on July 28, coinciding with Ether's highest level in 2025. Still, that does not mean investors have become optimistic about Ether's price outlook. Part of investors' disappointment can be linked to the drop in deposits across decentralized applications (DApps). In USD terms, Ethereum's base layer continues to dominate with a 59% share of total TVL. Ether investors' reduced optimism has also been reflected in ETH options markets, as the 25% delta skew (put‑call) indicator reached 6% on Saturday, right at the neutral‑to‑bearish threshold. The skew increases when demand for protective put (sell) options. The current 3% reading suggests a balanced risk assessment, indicating that bullish sentiment has not returned. ETH prices on Coinbase and Kraken are currently trading at a slight discount compared to Binance and Bitfinex, potentially signaling weaker demand from institutional desks. This contrasts sharply with the period between July 10 and July 23, when price premiums likely reflected companies raising capital to accumulate ETH reserves. Related: Crypto funds see $223M outflow, ending 15-week streak as Fed dampens sentiment Institutional demand for ETH appears to have declined notably, especially as Ether spot exchange‑traded funds (ETFs) recorded $129 million in net outflows between Wednesday and Friday. At present, there are no evident catalysts capable of decoupling Ether from the broader cryptocurrency market and driving its price above $3,800. There is no imminent driver for a cryptocurrency rally, particularly as global trade war risks persist and concerns grow over the US job market outlook. Without renewed institutional inflows, ETH will likely continue moving closely with the overall altcoin market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bullish, the owner of the Bullish Exchange crypto platform, said it plans to raise as much as $629 million in its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, which also owns CoinDesk, said it plans to sell 20.3 million ordinary shares with an expected price of $28-$31 per share. The move sees Bullish join a number of crypto firms entering public markets since President Donald Trump took office after a pro-crypto election campaign. Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, went public in June, as did Israeli social trading platform eToro. Industry majors including BitGo, Grayscale have filed for IPOs as well, while exchanges Kraken and OKX are also said to be mulling similar moves. Funds managed by BlackRock and ARK Investment Management have shown interest in buying up to $200 million worth of shares at the IPO price, according to the amended F-1 document. Bullish runs an institutional trading platform providing spot and derivatives trading as well as liquidity services, according to its filing. In the first quarter, it posted a $349 million loss after reporting profit of $80 million for all of 2024. That includes the GENIUS Act being signed into law last month, and a series of legal actions brought during the previous administration against leading industry participants being dropped. The improved regulatory climate has helped prices soar. Bitcoin BTC$115,310.58 is up more than 22% this year to trade around $115,000 while the broader market, measured through the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, has gained 32%.

The report advocates for a mixture of legislation, agency action through rulemaking and exemptive orders, and the issuance of agency interpretive guidance. It also urges agencies to act in coordination. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins's July 30 statement in support of the recommendations is here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new report by Ripple, CB Insights, and the UK Centre of Blockchain Technologies reveals that the blockchain is no longer just for the crypto bros – global banking giants are among its most active investors. Titled ‘Banking on Digital Assets: How Traditional Finance is Investing in Blockchain', the report found that between 2020 and 2024, over $100B was invested in blockchain firms across over 10K deals. Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Japan's SBI Group were among the biggest spenders. Interestingly, tokenization emerged as a core focus of their strategies. This underscores how committed TradFi giants are to expanding investor access through Web3 tech, plus how vital the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Layer 2 solution could become in supporting that infrastructure. Of the ‘mega-round' deals, the Web3 use cases that stood out among TradFi firms included institutional infrastructure for trading, staking, and tokenization. This growing appeal comes from the fact that tokenization enables investors to purchase small portions of traditionally high-cost assets, like real estate or bonds. This helps open up investment opportunities to more participants. So, it's no surprise that major banks are already investing heavily in this space. For instance, JPMorgan's Kinexys platform enables tokenized US Treasury transactions. Meanwhile HSBC has launched a tokenized gold product for both institutional and retail investors. He recently announced that Commission staff will take active steps to remove regulatory roadblocks and work with firms looking to tokenize stocks, bonds, and other securities. It also includes the foundational tools needed to power future tokenized economies, like smart contracts, DeFi, and the ability to mint wrapped crypto assets cross-chain. To preserve Bitcoin's base layer security while scaling activity off-chain, transactions are batched and verified using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs. This ensures fast, trustless execution with minimal on-chain footprint. If you hold $HYPER, the project's native token, you can also enjoy lower gas fees, governance rights, and staking rewards at a 156% APY. $HYPER has already raised $6.8M+, backed by individual whale investments like $54.1K and $53.9K back in June. As interest in Bitcoin Hyper's Layer 2 solution continues to grow, so too does the presale. As traditional banks invest more into the blockchain and the SEC makes moves to make its crypto policy less stringent, a new era of tokenized finance is quickly falling into place. It appears that Bitcoin Hyper is launching at a peak time. With its SVM-powered execution layer, trustless bridging, and real-world utility across DeFi, it has the potential to support future tokenized assets in a permissionless, public ecoystem. You can unlock the L2's full potential by purchasing $HYPER on presale today. DYOR and put in more than you're willing to lose.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While big names like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) remain favorites among institutional investors, a new player is quietly taking headlines: Remittix (RTX). With a stunning 400% to 424% gain during its ICO phase and real-world use built in, analysts say it could be one of the best ICOs since Solana and Ethereum. According to industry coverage, Remittix's ICO has raised over $18 million, trading at $0.0895. By contrast, Solana, which saw a price rise of up to 44% within a week, still hovers near long-term resistance zones around $200, with more modest growth expectations through 2025. Experts draw parallels between Solana's price and Ethereum's price, as well as the early stages of both projects' success, including low capitalization, infrastructure themes, and Remittix's utility-first PayFi model. They argue that demographically, RTX's product has an even broader appeal: the $150 trillion global cross-border payment market. While Solana and Ethereum build development ecosystems, Remittix stands out for solving a real consumer pain point with its crypto-to-fiat remittance network; faster, cheaper, and more secure than traditional platforms. Prominent crypto traders publicly cited RTX as their top pick heading into Q2–Q3 of 2025. With over $18 million raised, 580 million tokens sold, and Beta Wallet launch slated for September 2025, Remittix is being described as more than an ICO; it's a platform preparing for lift-off. While Solana and Ethereum build future utility, Remittix is delivering usable payment solutions today. For anyone seeking high-potential, utility-based tokens, RTX is delivering serious returns, and few projects have achieved this with the same level of structure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, as fears swirl around the future of the U.S. dollar, Wall Street giant BlackRock could be poised to extend its huge bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) lead over its rivals. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run The long-awaited move is part of the SEC's overhaul of former chair Gary Gensler's preference for crypto exchange-traded products to be cash only, which was perceived to be a barrier to efficiency for institutional market makers. It means there is a new sheriff in town,” Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told the financial newswire. This is the first of what will be several steps toward a more pro-crypto SEC.” BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager which runs the dominant spot bitcoin ETF with $85 billion in assets under management, filed a request in January to allow in-kind transactions. Others, including Fidelity, which runs the second-largest bitcoin fund with $23 billion in assets under management, followed suit. BlackRock, which manages around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street's campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024 that now hold almost 1.5 million bitcoin worth $170 billion. While BlackRock's bitcoin fund is expected to benefit from the change, the second-largest bitcoin fund, run by Fidelity, could see its market share shrink, according to NYDIG's global head of research Greg Cipolaro. “As volatility declines, [bitcoin] becomes more investable for institutional portfolios seeking balanced risk exposure. With risk-parity pioneer Ray Dalio recently advocating for a 15% portfolio allocation to gold and crypto in the face of ballooning government debt, the feedback loop of falling volatility leading to increased spot buying could become a powerful driver of sustained demand.” Last week, legendary billionaire Ray Dalio set markets alight when he recommended a 15% bitcoin or gold portfolio allocation, warning the Federal Reserve has been caught up in debt “doom loop" and that the dollar is past the “point of no return.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tether's USDT will soon get its own blockchain called Plasma, which plans to draw in users by offering zero fees on transfers of the stablecoin. “Tron's revenue dominance comes almost entirely from its outsized share of USDT transfers,” the bank's analysts said in a third-quarter investment outlook report. “This dominance may come under pressure as Tether launches its Plasma chain.” Backed by Tether sister company Bitfinex, Plasma is already making waves. The blockchain recently raised $373 million selling its native XPL token, and is set to go live with $1 billion worth of deposits. Yet it's blockchains like Tron that benefit when holders use USDT for transfers or in decentralised finance. Plasma is positioned to tap precisely into this aspect of the stablecoin business. And it's not just Tether looking to capture more of the value created by its stablecoin. This demographic uses stablecoins as an alternative to unstable local currencies for everyday payments. Much of Tron's success stems from its early lead in emerging markets and its integrations with Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, Amir Hajian, a researcher at crypto market maker Keyrock, told DL News. Plasma is following a similar playbook to try and replicate Tron's success, Hajian said. Tron isn't the only blockchain Plasma could siphon USDT from. Ethereum, which hosts $67 billion worth of the stablecoin, is at risk too. The two blockchains face different risks, according to Paige Horinek, analytics lead at Serotonin. She told DL News that a scenario where Ethereum loses 30% of USDT use to Plasma could cost the blockchain $230,000 to $370,000 in lost fees every day. However, the impact might be felt more on Ethereum as the network is currently inflationary, meaning that it issues more new Ether tokens than are burned to pay for transactions. Conversely, Tron mints less than it burns, so its supply keeps shrinking, Horinek said. Hajian, however, isn't convinced Plasma will steal much USDT use from Ethereum. For one thing, Ethereum's power users are less sensitive to high fees because most of them are professional money managers, institutional investors, or high-net-worth individuals. It will take time for Plasma to build trust and credibility, Hajian said. “In the near term, it's unlikely to threaten Ethereum's revenue or institutional edge.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UK has been left behind in the cryptocurrency boom and is in danger of missing a second wave of demand, according to the former chancellor George Osborne. Far from being an early adopter, we have allowed ourselves to be left behind,” wrote Osborne in a Financial Times opinion piece. Osborne said the UK was now about to miss a new surge in the crypto market: stablecoins. Unlike bitcoin, which is prone to extreme fluctuations in price, stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to the value of real-world currencies such as the dollar – and thus designed to maintain a stable value. However, a leading stablecoin, TerraUSD, collapsed in 2022. “If Britain was the only financial centre in the world we could take our time to evaluate how stablecoins will develop, but we are not,” wrote Osborne. “Singapore, Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi have adopted comprehensive legislative frameworks for crypto asset platforms.” Britain's current approach ensures the pound won't even play a supporting role,” Osborne wrote. US citizens can buy a bitcoin exchange traded fund – a basket of assets that can be bought and sold like shares on an exchange – whereas in the UK retail investors cannot do so. Osborne accused the UK of prevaricating over stablecoins, with the current chancellor, Rachel Reeves, showing insufficient commitment with a promise last month to “drive forward” on stablecoins, while the Bank of England remained sceptical. “This hesitation risks irrelevance,” wrote Osborne, who added that it was time for the UK to “catch up”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That sidechain can run smart contracts programmed for Ethereum. One is a payments chain with compliance baked into its DNA; the other is the original smart contract workhorse. Let's explore why that crossover could send XRP's long-term growth prospects into overdrive. For years, one key issue was that any developer who wanted to make smart contracts or decentralized apps (dApps) on XRP's chain would need to learn a different technology stack. It went live on the mainnet on June 30, delivering full Ethereum-compatible smart contract support to the XRP universe. That means that porting an existing decentralized exchange (DEX) or lending protocol to XRP is almost a copy-and-paste job. This solution is ingenious because it preserves XRPL's ultra-cheap, near-instant payment rails and compliance features, while insulating the core network from the heavier computation and potential exploits that come with generalized smart contracts. It also makes siphoning skilled smart contract developers from Ethereum extremely easy. So getting at least some of them to contribute to the XRP ecosystem instead of Ethereum is practically a given, especially if more capital is made available for their purposes. Bridges remain a favorite attack vector for hackers, and fragmenting liquidity across a sidechain can dull network effects if users refuse to hop over or if the friction of transiting capital from the main net to the sidechain or vice versa is too burdensome. This is an enabler for XRP's ecosystem to grow over time, sending the chain's value skyward along the way. As of late July, the Ethereum ecosystem boasted about 5,866 monthly active developers. In contrast, XRPL's community sat near 2,800 active contributors as of June. Assuming a modest 5% of Ethereum's builders decide that porting to XRPL EVM is worth a weekend hackathon to set up a new project, that's roughly 293 fresh minds working on the chain, or a significant 10% bump to XRPL's current monthly developer base. At least some of them will come back and build something again in the future, especially if there's another round of grants issued by Ripple that encourage them to do so. More realistically, if the sidechain matures and eventually captures 10% to 15% of Ethereum's developers, XRP could expand its builder cohort without spending a dime on recruitment. Developer activity correlates strongly with network value creation. While Ethereum certainly enjoys tremendous inertia as well as deep liquidity, developers are famously pragmatic, chasing lower fees, easier onboarding, and fresh user bases. Ethereum is hardly standing still, and it's the single most popular destination for developers for more than one reason. Yet the upside here is hard to ignore. XRP currently trades at about 40% of Ethereum's market cap, but it just unlocked access to the same talent reservoir. If even a sliver of that talent shifts, the ecosystem's growth curve could steepen sharply, providing a fresh fundamental pillar for long-term bullish theses. For investors, the launch doesn't rewrite XRP's risk profile overnight, but it meaningfully improves its upside-to-risk ratio. Long-term holders now have a new catalyst to watch in the form of developer traction, while prospective buyers have a new and quantifiable reason to start nibbling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Data protection watchdog clarifies requirements for trust systems ahead of UK regulatory changes. The Information Commissioner's Office published comprehensive guidance on July 30, 2025, addressing data protection obligations for organizations deploying profiling tools in trust and safety systems. The 12-section document establishes compliance frameworks for user-to-user services implementing behavioral analysis technologies to meet Online Safety Act requirements. According to the ICO, profiling tools analyze user characteristics, behavior, interests or preferences through automated processing of personal data. Subscribe the PPC Land newsletter ✉️ for similar stories like this one. Tools may retain and continuously update analysis outputs or produce temporary evaluations for specific decision points. Organizations must identify lawful processing bases before deploying profiling tools, with legal obligation and legitimate interests representing the most relevant options for trust and safety applications. According to the guidance, legal obligation applies when processing supports compliance with Online Safety Act duties, provided the personal information processing remains necessary and proportionate to achieve compliance. The legitimate interests basis requires organizations to conduct three-part assessments identifying their legitimate interest, demonstrating processing necessity, and balancing interests against user rights and freedoms. Organizations using profiling for terms of service enforcement or Online Safety Act compliance may establish legitimate interests, but must demonstrate compelling justification for privacy-intrusive methods. Contract serves as a lawful basis when profiling tools are integral to core service delivery and represent proportionate methods for achieving organizational purposes. The ICO requires data protection impact assessments before deploying profiling tools due to high-risk processing characteristics. These systems collect information at significant scale, potentially leading to unwarranted intrusion and loss of personal data control. The requirement extends to all profiling deployments regardless of organizational size or user volume. The guidance states organizations must "make data protection an essential component of the core functionality of your profiling tools" while processing only personal information necessary for specified purposes. For children's data processing, the ICO requires conformance with the Children's Code, which recommends switching profiling off by default unless compelling reasons justify activation. Organizations must inform users about profiling tool deployment through privacy notices meeting UK GDPR Article 13 requirements. Information must include processing confirmation, purposes, lawful bases, retention periods, third-party sharing arrangements, user rights, and automated decision-making details affecting users. The guidance emphasizes additional transparency considerations given profiling tools' intrusive nature. Organizations should consider providing information about decision types made through tools and automated technologies utilized, balanced against risks of malicious users circumventing detection systems. Organizations must use varied communication techniques including dedicated website areas, signup information, user dashboards, and moderation action notifications. Processing special category information through profiling tools requires Article 9 conditions beyond lawful bases. Organizations may rely on preventing or detecting unlawful acts, regulatory requirements, or safeguarding of children and at-risk individuals conditions, typically requiring appropriate policy documents. Criminal offense information processing requires Article 10 conditions and Schedule 1 compliance. This encompasses suspicion or allegations of criminal activity alongside formal convictions and offenses. Organizations must demonstrate processing occurs under official authority control or domestic law authorization through specific Schedule 1 conditions. Statistical accuracy concerns how frequently AI systems produce correct predictions measured against properly labeled test data. Organizations must consider statistical adequacy for intended purposes without requiring 100% accuracy, but should evaluate incorrect assessment possibilities and their user impact. According to the document, profiling tool outputs often represent predictions about behavioral likelihood rather than factual user information. Organizations should ensure records indicate outputs constitute "statistically informed guesses, rather than facts" to prevent misinterpretation as definitive user characteristics. Profiling tool deployment triggers enhanced user rights under data protection legislation. Subject access requests must provide confirmation of personal information processing, copies of input and output data, and moderation decision information generated through profiling analysis. Rectification requests require reconsideration of information accuracy even when organizations previously validated system functioning. Users objecting to legitimate interests processing may compel cessation unless organizations demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds overriding user interests, rights and freedoms, or processing supports legal claim establishment, exercise or defense. Solely automated decisions producing legal or similarly significant user effects require Article 22 compliance when profiling supports such determinations. Organizations relying on domestic law authorization, contract necessity, or explicit consent exceptions must implement appropriate safeguards protecting user rights, freedoms and legitimate interests. Domestic law authorization includes Online Safety Act compliance where solely automated decision-making represents the most appropriate implementation method. Required safeguards include enabling human intervention, allowing users to express viewpoints, and providing decision contestation mechanisms. Online Safety Act complaints processes may satisfy these requirements when properly implemented alongside data protection law obligations. Organizations operating comprehensive analytics solutions tracking user behavior across digital touchpoints likely require data protection officer appointments under emerging regulatory frameworks. Recent coverage on PPC Land examined ICO's consent or pay model guidance, demonstrating the regulator's comprehensive approach to balancing commercial viability with privacy protection. The profiling guidance extends this framework to trust and safety technologies increasingly deployed across digital platforms. Marketing professionals must prepare for enhanced regulatory visibility into data processing practices as UK authorities continue coordinating with European counterparts despite post-Brexit regulatory divergence. Cross-border operations require navigation of both UK reporting requirements and European transparency obligations under varying jurisdictional frameworks.

Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA): These mandatory evaluations identify and mitigate privacy risks before deploying profiling tools. The ICO requires DPIAs due to profiling's high-risk characteristics including large-scale data collection, significant user effects, and potential discrimination risks. Online Safety Act: This UK legislation establishes duties for user-to-user services to protect users from illegal content and harmful behaviors. The Act creates legal obligations that may justify profiling tool deployment under data protection law's legal obligation basis, provided processing remains necessary and proportionate for compliance. Profiling tools may process this information directly as inputs or generate such inferences, necessitating substantial public interest conditions and appropriate policy documents. Automated Decision-Making: Processing that produces decisions without meaningful human involvement, potentially triggering Article 22 restrictions when creating legal or similarly significant effects. Organizations must implement safeguards including human intervention rights, viewpoint expression opportunities, and decision contestation mechanisms. These systems increasingly rely on profiling tools to analyze user behavior patterns and characteristics for proactive threat identification. Profiling Tools: Technologies using automated processing to evaluate user characteristics, behavior, interests, or preferences for predictive analysis. These systems assign risk scores, reputation indicators, or behavioral classifications to support moderation decisions and safety measures across digital platforms. Processing: Any operation performed on personal data including collection, analysis, storage, sharing, and decision-making. Organizations deploying profiling tools must facilitate these rights through appropriate response procedures, accuracy reconsideration processes, and decision contestation mechanisms. Subscribe the PPC Land newsletter ✉️ for similar stories like this one. What: Comprehensive guidance addressing data protection obligations for profiling tools that analyze user characteristics, behavior, interests or preferences through automated processing to support Online Safety Act compliance. When: Published July 30, 2025, with review scheduled due to Data (Use and Access) Act implementation on June 19, 2025. Where: UK organizations using profiling for trust and safety purposes, with implications for cross-border operations requiring coordination between UK and European privacy frameworks. Why: Organizations require clear compliance frameworks for behavioral analysis technologies detecting grooming, terrorism, fraud, and other harmful online activities while protecting user privacy rights and freedoms.</p>
