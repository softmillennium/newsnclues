                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Holger Rune is not afraid of making some surprise choices throughout his career on the ATP Tour. Rune surprised many by working with Andre Agassi, the former world number one who helped give him some pointers. The Dane has suffered some disappointing defeats recently, but Rune still believes he is not far away from Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. Although he was able to win a couple of matches at the Canadian Open, Rune was then beaten in the fourth round by Alexei Popyrin. Popyrin was not on Rune's list of the nicest players on the ATP Tour, but another Australian did make an appearance. Rune agreed with both Daniil Medvedev and Francisco Cerundolo, the latter who he actually picked, by naming Alcaraz. The world number nine also chose Gael Monfils and Ben Shelton, but the fifth player he named may come as a surprise to some. Nick Kyrgios has been involved in spats with fellow ATP players before, but Rune claimed that he has always been nice to him. Saw some re reoccurring names #fyp #overtimetennis #tennis #tennisplayer #tennistiktok #viral #carlosalcaraz @ATP Tour It does not appear that this friendship is one-sided, with Kyrgios also recently complimenting Rune for something he recently said. Rune received heavy criticism at Wimbledon this year for claiming that he would have beaten his opponent, Nicolas Jarry, nine times out of ten in ‘normal conditions' after claiming he had a knee injury. “My villain of the week is Holger [Rune],” Kyrgios said last month. “I just love that comment, straight away saying that he would beat [Nicolas] Jarry nine times out of ten. That is something I would have said in my press conferences.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andrey Rublev is looking to go one better than last year while competing at the 2025 Canadian Open. He is back in the quarter-finals this year, following a three-set victory over Washington Open finalist, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. Rublev has managed to establish a solid infrastructure around him, having been with the same coach for almost a decade. Rublev's coaching consistency pales in comparison with the recent coaching changes being carried out en masse across the ATP and WTA Tours. In the last month Stefanos Tsitsipas has re-hired his father after parting ways with Goran Ivanisevic, Naomi Osaka has split with Patrick Mouratoglou, and there is continued uncertainty surrounding Emma Raducanu's coaching situation. In contrast, Andrey Rublev remains a symbol of stability in professional tennis, and he spoke about his relationship with coach Fernando Vicente in his most recent press conference. Speaking to reporters after the match, Rublev was asked about his relationship with his coach, Fernando Vicente. It's more than a player and coach. He's a family member, and he will be, no matter what, for the rest of my life. He was there for me, not seeing his family, sacrificing his family to spend time with me. We can be super open about everything with each other. “It's kind of a relationship, I don't know. I was really liking that I was able to find someone that he's super good at tennis, he's super talented in tennis as a coach, as a player, and on top of that, like a human being, he's one of the best I've ever met.” Rublev was then asked to explain the advantages of staying with one coach for a long time. The Russian and Vicente have worked together since 2016. Advantages is that he's one of the best coaches that I ever met, and I was lucky to have him. And we get already, like I said, like we are family members, and that's it. He have a lot of humanity inside. He's doing a lot of things for me that normally, when you hire someone as a coach or something, half of the coaches they don't do those things. And I know at the end he give me everything to be able to be at my best, and it's about me. “It doesn't matter how many coaches you're going to change. At this level, when you are top 10, okay, maybe there is someone who, the players who won a lot of slams, they can give some advice how to, what you need to do at these levels to achieve that moment. Fernando Vicente has worked with Andrey Rublev for almost a decade, helping the Russian star to establish himself as one of the best ATP Tour players around. He won three singles titles after turning professional in 1996. Vicente had already begun coaching Marc Lopez and Marcel Granollers when he retired from tennis in 2011. The now-established coach worked with Lopez and Granollers from 2010 to 2014. Under the tutelage of Vicente, Rublev has won 17 ATP Tour titles, including two ATP Masters 1000 titles in Monte-Carlo and Madrid. Fritz won a marathon three-set match against Jiri Lehecka in the fourth round: each set was won on a tiebreak.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>19, continued the upsets at the Canadian Open in Montreal with a 7-6(1), 6-3 win over Wimbledon champion Iga Świątek in one hour and 53 minutes Sunday night. On Saturday, it was the world No. 2 and top seed Coco Gauff in straight sets to Canadian wild card Victoria Mboko. Sunday night, it was Świątek's turn to lose, unable to make the quarterfinals in her first tournament since winning her sixth slam. “I think that really helped me today in the important moments.” At 3-2, a game where she saved four break points before holding, Tauson went after Świątek's forehand on one of the chances. Attacking Świątek's forehand continued in the first set tiebreak. Instead of Świątek being patient on the return, a strategy she adopted during her championship run at Wimbledon, she elected to be more aggressive on the first swing. For the match, Świątek won just 24 percent (12-of-49) of points on Tauson's first serve. Clara Tauson picks up her first career win over Swiatek and moves into the quarterfinals!#OBN25 pic.twitter.com/MthAOUzRYj On Świątek's serve, Tauson was aggressive off the return, putting pressure immediately with blazing cross-court winners. Despite getting broken at 4-2, Tauson remained calm, and Świątek double-faulted on break point in the next game to give Tauson back her two-game cushion, as well as the opportunity to serve for the match. Tauson said after the match that despite getting broken, she thought she was playing “the right way.” “I felt like I had a bit better luck in my returning games, and obviously she started with a double fault in the next game, which gave me a little bit more confidence going into the rest of the points,” Tauson said. At match point, Tauson won another short rally, thanks to a Świątek backhand in the net. She finally recorded her first career win against the world No. At Wimbledon, Świątek cruised to a straight-set win over Tauson en route to capturing the title but in Canada it was Tauson's turn, advancing to her second WTA 1000 quarterfinal of 2025. In February at the Dubai Tennis Championships, Tauson trounced world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in straight sets 6-3, 6-2, once again relying on a clutch serve — winning 80 percent of first serve points — and power from the baseline. Next up for Tauson is the current Australian Open champion Madison Keys, who saved two match points en route to a thrilling three-set victory over Karolína Muchová, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After stunning world No 2 Coco Gauff in the round of 16, Mboko has cemented her place as one to watch in the future. One of the most accomplished French players of the Open Era, Tauziat found success in both singles and doubles across her career. In a career that spanned almost two decades, Tauziat won eight WTA Tour titles and reached a further 14 finals, including at Wimbledon in 1998. Tauziat reached a further four quarter-finals at the All England Club and was a 1991 French Open and 2000 US Open quarter-finalist. She called time on her singles career in 2001, having reached a career-high of world No 3 in 2000, with former world No 1 Amelie Mauresmo the only French woman ever to be ranked higher. Tauziat also reached world No 3 in the doubles rankings, winning 25 tour-level titles and reaching a further 32 finals in her career. She was a finalist alongside Kimberly Po at the 2001 US Open and reached a further six doubles Grand Slam semi-finals. Towards the end of her doubles career in 2003, Tauziat took on a brief mentorship role with then-rising star Marion Bartoli, a future Wimbledon champion and top-10 player. However, the 57-year-old has spent a large chunk of her coaching career working within Canadian tennis, guiding a range of rising Canadian stars. What Coco Gauff said about Victoria Mboko comparisons after Canadian Open upset 5 youngest women to beat No 1 seed at a WTA 1000 event: Victoria Mboko joins Coco Gauff, Mirra Andreeva She then worked with Aleksandra Wozniak for a short spell from the end of 2013, before turning her attention back towards working with an array of junior stars. The pair had parted ways in 2018, but Tauziat has remained a key figure in the Canadian setup and was part of the coaching team during Canada's historic Billie Jean King Cup triumph in 2023. Having been ranked outside of the top 300 when starting to work with Tauziat, Mboko is now comfortably inside the world's top 100. Speaking to Tennis Canada during her Grand Slam debut at the French Open in May, Mboko spoke about the impact Tauziat had on her career. With Nathalie, it's very relaxed on court – she obviously has a lot of knowledge. Victoria Mboko has joined an elite WTA 1000 list. Victoria Mboko is the talk of the women's game after a sensational win against Coco Gauff - and her ranking is leaping. Coco Gauff has revealed what "maybe wasn't the right decision" after her Canadian Open exit. Canadian wildcard Victoria Mboko claimed a big upset in Montreal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Shelton was involved in a heated exchange with Flavio Cobolli after a fiery fourth-round match in Toronto. But as they met, the pair appeared to get into a discussion over a gesture made by Cobolli during the third set tie-break, which Shelton thought was inappropriate. Shelton was later asked about what was said between the two players, and revealed they spoke about what had unfolded in the locker room too. He said (the gesture) wasn't towards me,” the American, who is in a high-profile relationship with Trinity Rodman, explained. We talked about it in the locker room, so I'm not going to answer any more questions about that. "There's no story, we're good, that's it, so, thanks.” While the pair were able to talk through their issues, the tense on-court exchange soured what was a milestone night for Shelton. He will next seek another milestone -- his first ATP Masters 1000 semi-final -- when he takes on Alex de Minaur later this week. The result also saw Shelton level his head-to-head record with Cobolli at 2-2, having also picked up a win at the Mexican Open this season. While he was eventually victorious in Canada, the World No. 7 struggled at times, with Cobolli limiting his explosive game as he took a lead in the deciding set. He wrapped up victory with a third set tie-break for the second consecutive match. Shelton, who last month exposed a Wimbeldon farce in 65 seconds, dispatched fellow American Brandon Nakashima before defeating Cobolli. "I thought I did a really good job rallying and finding a way to put returns in the court late," Shelton said. Shelton will face De Minaur in his quarter-final match on Tuesday. 6, if he can win his third ATP Tour title this week. The American is 16-7 this year on hard courts, a record that includes his run to the Australian Open semi-finals back in January.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu is facing the prospect of heading into the US Open unseeded after her heavy defeat in Montreal. It was shaping up to be another positive tournament run for the Brit, who made it to the semi-finals in Washington just over a week ago, but her outing at the Canadian Open was ended abruptly by Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova. After breezing past Elena-Gabriela Ruse and Peyton Stearns in the first two rounds, Raducanu was thrashed 6-2 6-1 by fifth seed Anisimova on Saturday. The result, and those of her tennis rivals, have seen Raducanu drop down to 38th in the WTA's live rankings. You can check out at any time. She went into the Canadian Open ranked 33rd - a healthy position from which to break into the top 32 and bank herself a vital seeding for the US Open later this month. But the 22-year-old is now six places off where she needs to be, with Naomi Osaka, Xinyu Wang and Dayana Yastremska all moving up amid strong showings in Montreal. One of the benefits for Raducanu is that she has no ranking points to defend leading up to the US Open. She did not play any warm-up tournaments in preparation for last year's trip to New York so WTA events in Cleveland or Monterrey could be opportunities for her to make ground. It remains to be seen whether the Brit and her camp prioritise a seeding or staying fresh after last year's debacle, when Raducanu was knocked out in the first round of the US Open by Sofia Kenin before admitting to flaws in her scheduling in a teary press conference. "Obviously, this is a tournament I really want to do well in. Yeah, I would have preferred to probably play a little bit more before coming into the US Open. "You know, I know when I have a lot of matches, just like every player, you feel really good. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding.

Tauson, seeded 16th in the hard-court event, avenged a loss to Swiatek at Wimbledon, where she lost 6-4, 6-1 after struggling with illness in her straight-sets loss.

The 22-year-old Tauson used her creativity and firepower to frustrate the six-time Grand Slam champion from Poland, staying calm when she was broken in the second set and sealing the win when Swiatek's backhand landed in the net.

"It's tough conditions here with the wind, but I tried my best to keep my head cool and keep working," Tauson said in her on-court interview.

"Even though I got broken in the second set, I was feeling confident and I'm really happy about the win."

Swiatek's loss came a day after top seed Coco Gauff was stunned in straight sets by Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko, and both Swiatek and Gauff will look to sharpen their games ahead of the start of the U.S. Open later this month.

World number one and U.S. Open defending champion Aryna Sabalenka is not competing in Montreal.

Tauson, seeded 16th, will face Madison Keys in the quarterfinals after the big-serving American saved two match points to emerge with a hard-fought 4-6 6-3 7-5 win over Czech Karolina Muchova.

Tauson beat Keys in their only previous meeting in Auckland in January. Keys went on to capture her first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open later that month.

Tauson won her only tour title in New Zealand in January, beating fellow Montreal quarterfinalist Naomi Osaka of Japan in the final</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MONTREAL — Clara Tauson of Denmark upset second-seeded Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek of Poland 7-6 , 6-3 on Sunday night to reach the National Bank Open quarterfinals. The 6-foot Tauson, seeded 16th in the hard-court event that ends Thursday, avenged a loss to Swiatek at Wimbledon to set up a match Tuesday with sixth-seeded Australian Open winner Madison Keys of the United States. “I think, obviously, getting a win against her after losing to her in Wimbledon a couple of weeks ago is, obviously, nice, because I was not feeling great in that match, and I felt like I was playing some good tennis in Wimbledon,” Tauson said. Keys outlasted 11th-seeded Karolina Muchova of Czechia 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 in the windy afternoon session. "Clara's a fantastic ball-striker,” Keys said about the quarterfinal match. She's got a lot of power on both sides. She covers the court quite well on top of everything, so I feel like she's one of those matches where you kind of have to temper a little bit and not go for things too quickly.” Osaka also advanced in the afternoon, routing Anastasija Sevastova of Latvia 6-1, 6-0 in 49 minutes — the second-fastest victory of her career. On Tuesday, she will face 10th-seeded Elina Svitolina of Ukraine, a 6-4, 6-1 winner over fifth-seed Amanda Anisimova of the United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It looked as if Ben Shelton would be made to wait for his 100th tour-level win after falling behind 3-5 in the final set against Flavio Cobolli Sunday night at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers. He will next seek another milestone — his first ATP Masters 1000 semi-final — when he takes on Alex de Minaur in his fourth quarter-final at the prestigious level. I was down and out, being a break down in the third, the way that he was playing," Shelton said post-match. "I gave myself a second chance and I did a good job with it, kind of running from there. A really difficult opponent for me, someone who's gotten me in three sets after I've won the first set twice." "I thought I did a really good job rallying and finding a way to put returns in the court late in the match. I was struggling with my two biggest weapons, the serve and the first-ball forehand," Shelton said. "Coming through in the end I think speaks a lot about my mental toughness and my ability to be scrappy in those moments, more so than my actual play." Shelton is into his third consecutive quarter-final after reaching that stage at Wimbledon and advancing to the semis last week in Washington, D.C. He is 16-7 this year on hard courts, including his run to the Australian Open semi-finals. Cobolli was denied the biggest win of his career by PIF ATP Ranking against the World No. The Italian was seeking his first Top 10 win in a completed match, having beaten then-No. 9 Holger Rune via retirement in Madrid this April. Shelton, who entered Toronto at a career-high in the PIF ATP Rankings, could move above Novak Djokovic to World No. 6 by winning his third ATP Tour title this week.
