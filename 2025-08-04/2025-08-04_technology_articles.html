                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle-based LevelTen Energy, a startup facilitating the deployment of clean energy projects, is laying off 60 workers according to a new Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) released by the Washington state Employment Security Department. LevelTen describes itself as the world's largest online marketplace connecting buyers, sellers, advisors and financiers of clean energy projects. Its customers include tech companies and other businesses and institutions looking to support renewable power in order to curb their climate emissions. The company's platform has been used for transactions totaling more than $14.8 billion. Clean energy deployments have been on the rise for many years, but Republican leaders in July passed their mega bill, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill, which cuts tax incentives for renewable wind and solar power passed during the Biden administration. Those breaks are scuttled in 2028, at which point new installations of onshore wind and solar in the U.S. are expected to plunge 41%, according to BloombergNEF. The headwinds come just a year after LevelTen raised a $65 million Series D round that included investments from Microsoft and Google, among others. As of last summer, the company had 130 employees and an optimistic outlook. Rob Collier, LevelTen's senior vice president of marketplaces, said that demand for the projects remained high. “And that's driven by a number of pretty strong macroeconomic forcing functions: the need for data centers, and the increased demand due to AI.” But he did acknowledge that the sector was not attracting new customers for power purchase agreements and that the supply side was getting more difficult, with ongoing challenges with permitting and electrical grid connections, as well as persistent uncertainty around policy and tariffs making it hard to plan and deploy the infrastructure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google's AI-powered bug hunter has just reported its first batch of security vulnerabilities. Heather Adkins, Google's vice president of security, announced Monday that its LLM-based vulnerability researcher Big Sleep found and reported 20 flaws in various popular open source software. Given that the vulnerabilities are not fixed yet, we don't have details of their impact or severity, as Google does not yet want to provide details, which is a standard policy when waiting for bugs to be fixed. But the simple fact that Big Sleep found these vulnerabilities is significant, as it shows these tools are starting to get real results, even if there was a human involved in this case. “To ensure high quality and actionable reports, we have a human expert in the loop before reporting, but each vulnerability was found and reproduced by the AI agent without human intervention,” Google's spokesperson Kimberly Samra told TechCrunch. Royal Hansen, Google's vice president of engineering, wrote on X that the findings demonstrate “a new frontier in automated vulnerability discovery.” LLM-powered tools that can look for and find vulnerabilities are already a reality. Vlad Ionescu, co-founder and chief technology officer at RunSybil, a startup that develops AI-powered bug hunters, told TechCrunch that Big Sleep is a “legit” project, given that it has “good design, people behind it know what they're doing, Project Zero has the bug finding experience and DeepMind has the firepower and tokens to throw at it.” There is obviously a lot of promise with these tools, but also significant downsides.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon is reportedly laying off more than 100 employees as it overhauls its podcast business amid major shifts in the industry. Bloomberg first reported on Monday that Amazon is laying off about 110 staff from its Wondery podcast studio and shifting some shows to Audible, its other audio-focused subsidiary. These changes reflect that evolution and will streamline how Wondery integrates further into Amazon. By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels, help them expand their brand IP, and simplify the process for advertisers while making content more accessible to audiences wherever they prefer to consume it. In a memo to staff obtained by Deadline, Steve Boom, Amazon's vice president of audio, Twitch, and games, said the rise of video podcasting has created “different audience needs” and requires “distinct discovery, growth, and monetization strategies” compared to traditional audio-only narrative podcasts. In the letter, Boom said that Amazon is reorganizing Wondery with its narrative podcasts like Dr. Death and Business Wars moving to Audible. The studio's chief content officer, Marshall Lewy, will also be headed to Audible. For Wondery's creator-led shows like Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert and Jason and Travis Kelce's New Heights, a new Creator Services team under Amazon's Talent Services division will be taking over. This team will continue operating the creator-focused podcast studio under the Wondery brand, working closely with a select group of top creators to expand their audiences and deepen their partnership with Amazon. Bloomberg highlighted LeBron James, who hosts the podcast Mind the Game and has served as a Prime Day spokesperson, as a blueprint for this new approach. Amazon originally acquired Wondery in 2021 for about $300 million, according to media reports. But Amazon isn't the only company that has poured big money into podcasting. Last year, Spotify reportedly signed a $250 million deal to continue managing sponsorships for Joe Rogan's podcast. Meanwhile, SiriusXM paid $125 million to poach Alex Cooper's Call Her Daddy podcast from Spotify. As competition has increased in the industry, there have already been some losers too. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which helps fund National Public Radio (NPR), a pioneer in podcasting, is set to wind down operations and lay off most of its staff by September 30. This move comes as President Donald Trump has cut the nonprofit's funding. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

In a press release obtained by Tom's Hardware today, AMD announced the Radeon RX 9060, a new entry-level GPU that is said to be optimized for 1080p gaming. Notably, the new graphics card will not be available for purchase through retail channels, but will only be available with PCs offered by "select system integrators." This GPU has 28 RDNA 4 compute units, down from 32 on the RX 9060 XT. AMD's decision to make the RX 9060 available only through system integrators (i.e., in prebuilt systems) seems like an unfortunate one. Even with only 8GB of VRAM, this product could have been an appealing upgrade for system builders on tight budgets. RX 9060 XT 8GB cards are currently available for about $250 to $300, depending on the retailer, and an even cheaper RDNA 4 card could have been compelling. Without an official MSRP, however, we have only a limited idea of how the RX 9060 would have been positioned in the Radeon RX 9000-series product family. AMD also plans to release a new Adrenalin driver update for its range of GPUs that expands support for a handful of newly released games. Driver version 25.8.1 will soon be available for download and offers optimized gameplay in Mafia: The Old Country, Mecha Break, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and the newly updated Unreal Engine 5 release of Valorant. The latest release is also said to offer support for the upcoming Battlefield 6 open beta, which is expected to roll out later this week. While AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4) is officially supported by a limited number of games, the latest update also expands support for the upscaling tech to more titles. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The limited availability of FSR 4 stands in stark contrast to Nvidia's latest DLSS 4 upscaling, which is currently supported in over 125 games and applications. While AMD is clearly working on expanding FSR 4 support, the technology is restricted to the company's latest Radeon RX 9000 series graphics cards, which further limits its reach.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new Ryzen 9000X3D flagship could be in the works. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The new processors will continue to utilize the Granite Ridge silicon with Zen 5 execution cores. One of the two rumored models will reportedly have 16 cores with simultaneous multithreading (SMT), a configuration similar to the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and the regular Ryzen 9 9950X. According to the leaker, the 16-core X3D part will reportedly employ a dual CCD (Core Complex Die) configuration. While AMD has previously released Ryzen chips with dual CCDs, the chipmaker has never slapped 3D V-Cache on both CCDs. Consequently, a chip featuring two CCDs would logically increase the maximum L3 cache to 192MB, which is 50% more than the amount found in the Ryzen 9 9950X3D. Although we have encountered 192MB of L3 cache as far back as AMD's EPYC 7002 (codenamed Rome) processors from the Zen 2 era, it remains an unprecedented feat for a consumer processor to possess such a substantial amount of L3 cache. Apparently, the Ryzen 9000X3D SKU with 3D V-Cache on both CCDs could have a 200W TDP. For now, we don't have an idea whether the clock speeds will be the same or higher. The second rumored processor allegedly boasts eight cores, sixteen threads, and a 96MB L3 cache. The leaker suggests that it's a 120W processor. These specifications are reminiscent of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which shares similar characteristics. However, the new SKU will probably be a lower-clocked variant of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, possibly a Ryzen 7 9700X3D or a similar model. Ryzen processors with a single CCD generally offer better gaming performance compared to those with two CCDs. This applies to the Ryzen X3D variant as well since the 3D V-Cache is only present on one of them. The disadvantage of dual CCDs is the introduction of latency, which negatively impacts performance because data has to travel across the CCDs instead of a single CCD. It would be intriguing to assess how having 3D V-Cache on both CCDs could enhance performance and possibly reduce latency. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. AMD could easily integrate 3D V-Cache into any number of CCDs it desired. Logically, producing a single CCD Ryzen 9000X3D is already expensive, so adding the L3 SRAM to both CCDs would make it even more costly. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D, which has a $699 MSRP, is already selling for $669. Introducing a new 16-core SKU with 192MB L3 cache will bring the MSRP closer to Ryzen Threadripper levels. So, AMD releasing an even higher-end part may be more about spurring sales of its platform rather than a need to stay ahead of its CPU competition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Gates Foundation today announced a $2.5 billion, five-year initiative focused on women's health that will support innovation in care, bolster data collection and aims to catalyze additional investments. A 2021 McKinsey study found that only 1% of healthcare R&D is invested in female-specific conditions beyond oncology, while a 2023 report from international health organizations found that a woman dies every two minutes due to pregnancy or childbirth. About 60% of the funding will be focused on obstetrics and maternal health. The philanthropy is supporting 40 innovations and 70% of the new investment will go towards R&D and product development, foundation leaders said on a call Monday with global media. “I've seen firsthand what happens when there's a lack of attention paid to women's health conditions,” said Dr. Ru Cheng, director of women's health innovations at Gates Foundation. Promising new technologies include an injectable, discreet contraceptive for women that lasts for six months, and the use of artificial intelligence with ultrasounds so any primary health care provider will be able to read them. “Investing in women's health has a lasting impact across generations. It leads to healthier families, stronger economies, and a more just world,” said Bill Gates, chair of the Gates Foundation, in a statement. “Yet women's health continues to be ignored, underfunded, and sidelined,” he added. “Too many women still die from preventable causes or live in poor health. The global public health sector is facing additional challenges following recent changes to U.S. foreign aid policy. Have a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

We remember reporting on a Modus Paper project update back in May 2024. However, there are users out there who don't need to be distracted by color, and are wary of the eye-strain and fatigue that can stem from the use of backlit or emissive displays. In fact, some would prefer simple, efficient paper-like, sunlight readable displays – if it were not for the performance penalties that seem to be inherent to e-Ink and e-paper implementations so far. This open-hardware electronic design should prevent e-paper from being “held back by proprietary controllers and slow performance.” In short, users should be able to benefit from e-paper ergonomic niceties, without cliff-face drawbacks. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. So, what do you get with a Modos Paper Dev Kit? Connectivity seems sufficient, with both HDMI and USB Type-C ports promised to offer plug & play on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It looks like the USB Type-C connection also delivers power, as expected. But if using this as an HDMI driven monitor, you will likely also need a power source of some kind attached to the USB Type-C port. There are multiple screen modes supported by these monitor kits. Modus says that the devices offer “binary, 4-level, and 16-level grayscale, plus a hybrid mode that refines images dynamically.” Support for color e-paper displays is present in the design/architecture, but they aren't being marketed right now. Those interested in acquiring one of these monitors can head on over to the project Crowd Supply. On that site, you will be choosing between a compact 6-inch, or more laptop-scale 13.3-inch kit. We often warn about crowdfunding campaigns, but note that Crowd Supply has a decent reputation for pushing projects to completion. It asserts that it is highly selective, looks for good plans to raise funds, and equally credible plans for manufacturing. Meanwhile, Crowd Supply handles fulfillment, media production, and more. Having said that, the platform admits “backing a product before it goes to market does entail some inherent risk. Delays, shortages, design problems, and other unforeseen issues can delay or prevent a project from getting to market.” So, take heed. Mark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

A new study from Microsoft reveals which jobs are most — and least — susceptible to generative AI, based on an analysis of 200,000 anonymized conversations with Bing Copilot users in 2024. Jobs involving manual labor, physical presence, or machinery operation ranked lowest. The research is unique because it analyzed actual AI usage from Copilot conversations in 2024 rather than relying on theoretical assessments. The researchers noted that their data only shows AI capability overlap with work activities, not actual job displacement. Historical examples show automation can sometimes increase rather than decrease employment in affected sectors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Through a series of experiments involving both wild and captive sea stars, they found evidence that Vibrio pectenicida is the likely cause of sea star wasting disease—a devastating condition that causes the invertebrates to decay and essentially “melt.” “This study definitely passes the sniff test for me. It seems quite convincing that V. pectenicida bacteria are at least one causative agent of SSWS,” Swartz said. Sea stars started disappearing in 2013, when a massive outbreak of SSWD struck the North American Pacific coast. The disease swept the seas from Alaska to Mexico, decimating more than 20 different species of sea stars, which are also known as starfish. Death by SSWD is often swift, killing the sea star within days. Researchers estimate that one particular sea star species, Pycnopodia helianthoides, has lost 90% of its population to SSWD. In the aftermath of SSWD outbreaks, some areas have also lost kelp forests, as sea urchins—once kept in check by sea stars—decimated the underwater forests. Marine scientists have been looking for the cause of SSWD ever since its emergence. And like any great mystery, there have been some twists. But subsequent studies showed that this virus—or any potentially pathogenic virus for that matter—could only be found in a minority of affected species, ruling it out as the likeliest suspect. Swartz noted that some Vibrio bacteria, however, were already known to cause disease in echinoderms—the broad group of marine invertebrates that includes sea stars. “So in a sense, it feels like the answer was hiding right under our noses. They exhaustively studied samples of sea stars with SSWD and healthy specimens, eventually finding that only the diseased sea stars carried high levels of the bacteria in their coelomic fluid (the invertebrate version of blood). These experiments are the same sort used to identify and conclusively show a particular germ causes a specific disease in humans, strengthening the team's case. Further analysis also revealed that SSWD is caused by a specific strain of the bacteria, called FHCF-3. “Here we use controlled exposure experiments, genetic datasets, and field observations to demonstrate that the bacterium, Vibrio pectenicida strain FHCF-3, is a causative agent of SSWD,” the authors wrote in their paper, published Monday in Nature Ecology and Evolution. Though the mystery of what causes SSWD appears solved, Swartz and the study authors note that there are still several important unanswered questions. For example, scientists aren't sure exactly how the outbreaks start. Still, given that SSWD remains a threat to sea stars, simply knowing its cause could boost sea star recovery efforts, the researchers said. It might be possible to find genetic mutations that help sea stars fend off these infections, for instance, enabling scientists to breed sea stars carrying these mutations in captivity with the aim of reintroducing them into the wild to bolster the population's resilience.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI startup Perplexity is crawling and scraping content from websites that have explicitly indicated they don't want to be scraped, according to internet infrastructure provider Cloudflare. The network infrastructure giant accused Perplexity of obscuring its identity when trying to scrape web pages “in an attempt to circumvent the website's preferences,” Cloudflare's researchers wrote. AI products like those offered by Perplexity rely on gobbling up large amounts of data from the internet, and AI startups have long scraped text, images, and videos from the internet many times without permission to make their products work. Perplexity appears to be willingly circumventing these blocks by changing its bots “user agent,” meaning a signal that identifies a website visitor by their device and version type; as well as changing their autonomous system networks, or ASN, essentially a number that identifies large networks on the internet, according to Cloudflare. We were able to fingerprint this crawler using a combination of machine learning and network signals,” read Cloudflare's post. Cloudflare said it first noticed the behavior after its customers complained that Perplexity was crawling and scraping their sites, even after they added rules on their Robots file and for specifically blocking Perplexity's known bots. Cloudflare said it then performed tests to check and confirmed that Perplexity was circumventing these blocks. “We observed that Perplexity uses not only their declared user-agent, but also a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome on macOS when their declared crawler was blocked,” according to Cloudflare. The company also said that it has de-listed Perplexity's bots from its verified list and added new techniques to block them. Last month, Cloudflare announced the launch of a marketplace allowing website owners and publishers to charge AI scrapers who visit their sites. Last year, news outlets, such as Wired, alleged Perplexity was plagiarizing their content. Weeks later, Perplexity's CEO Aravind Srinivas was unable to immediately answer when asked to provide the company's definition of plagiarism during an interview with TechCrunch's Devin Coldewey at the Disrupt 2024 conference.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Silicon Valley has pushed the world more and more into trying to make the generative AI boom sustain itself, Hollywood is still standing on the precipice of a transformative moment. Studios are grappling with the purported potential (and demands for cost savings) artificial intelligence models may bring, weighed against the legal minefields exploiting such technologies can represent—and an increasing public backlash to the technology. But a new report from the Wall Street Journal claims that there've been even more attempts behind the scenes at Disney's studio to try and utilize generative AI technologies… neither of which purportedly went very far or well, for very different reasons. Two upcoming productions that tried to navigate potential use of generative AI mentioned in the WSJ report are the upcoming live-action Moana remake and Tron: Ares. For the former, Disney reportedly planned to work with an AI company called Metaphysic to create a digital deepfake of actor Dwayne Johnson, set to reprise his role as the demigod Maui in the remake. In an attempt to reduce the number of days Johnson would be required on set for production, the alleged plan was to have Johnson's cousin, Tanoai Reed, act as a stand-in who would have Johnson's deepfaked face put over his performance in post-production. Although the plan was for a “small number of shots,” according to WSJ's report, after 18 months of negotiation and work between Disney and Metaphysic, none of the shots using Reed's performance will be in the final movie when it releases in July 2026. WSJ's report cited concerns over data security on Disney's end, as well as the legal question that lingers over any broader embrace of generative AI technology in Hollywood: who, exactly, owns the end product when generative AI models are used to create even a part of it? In June this year, Disney teamed up with Universal to sue Midjourney over what the suit described as a “bottomless pit of plagiarism,” accusing the AI company's image generator of breaching copyright laws to distribute and create images trained on the studios' library of characters and franchises. According to WSJ, the character would've been called “Bit” and acted as a potential companion to Jeff Bridges' returning Kevin Flynn, and built off of context provided by a writer, the generated character would then be recorded and deliver lines performed by an actor, responding as if the model itself were Bit. Marvel was lambasted for the use of generative AI to create the opening title sequence to its Disney+ series Secret Invasion in 2023, and found itself defending itself from accusations of its use once more for the early marketing campaign for Fantastic Four: First Steps. Earlier this summer, Disney's investment into Epic Games was touted through the arrival of a generative-AI-enhanced Darth Vader avatar in Fortnite to promote the battle royale video game's then-ongoing Star Wars event, “Galactic Battle”, where Darth Vader could be recruited by players, using a deepfake model of the late James Earl Jones' voice to interact with players in real time. Players promptly figured out ways to get around Epic's content restrictions and get the generative Vader to swear and use slurs. The legal outcome of Disney and Universal's lawsuit is still to be decided, but what is seemingly clear is that the potential AI takeover of Hollywood that has been feared with the proliferation of generative AI may not be as close as some people (and some companies) expect.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Take a peanut-based paste packed with 500 calories and nearly 13 grams of protein. No water or refrigeration is required, meaning it can be distributed in drought-hit areas and stored at ambient temperature for up to two years. Just a couple of daily sachets can lead to a 10 percent weight gain over six weeks, sustaining recovery from severe acute malnutrition for less than $60 per child. Developed by Normandy-based manufacturer Nutriset in 1996 by French paediatrician André Briend, it was the first ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF): energy-dense pastes that have boosted survival rates of severe acute malnutrition in children from less than 25 per cent to around 90 percent. “It's incredibly effective emergency food,” says medical doctor Steve Collins, founder of advocacy group Valid Nutrition. “RUTF contains all the essential nutrients required for someone to recover from severe acute malnutrition. Mana, for example, is an American-made RUTF produced in Fitzgerald, Georgia. Before Plumpy'Nut, cases of severe acute malnutrition—primarily occurring among children under 5 years old, diagnosed by very low weight-for-height scores and arm circumference—needed round-the-clock care at therapeutic feeding centres. Nurses at these makeshift hospitals in often remote areas would feed infants F100, a high-energy milk powder also made by Nutriset. It's one of the reasons why mortality rates for in-patient care lurked at around 20 percent. Over half of Plumpy'Nut is made from peanut paste and vegetable oils. Another quarter is reserved for sugar—masking the taste of the added micronutrients: potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, zinc, iodine, copper, selenium, and vitamins A, D, E, B complex, C, and K. Its oil base removed the risk of bacterial contamination. The premade RUTF sachet is a magic formula, says Collins. In starvation cases, refeeding syndrome can occur, a life-threatening metabolic condition in which nutrition that's too rapidly reintroduced leads to electrolyte imbalance. “As opposed to highly-concentrated formulas, where a child could easily overeat, parents can simply give their child RUTF and it's safe—the only limiting factor is appetite.” Collins first came across Plumpy'Nut in the 1998 Sudan famine, where he set up therapeutic feeding centers. “I quickly realized this was the future,” he says, “and that these sachets had to be administered at home, not at in-patient facilities.” He helped establish Plumpy'Nut's first widescale rollout during the 2000 Ethiopia famine, and pioneered a new community-based model: Parents would provide the emergency food rather than health care workers. It was adopted by the United Nations in 2004, and mortality rates for severe acute malnutrition with RUTF treatment are now typically under 5 percent. “No changes to the formulation have ever been done,” says Salima Boitout, group communication manager at Nutriset. UNICEF is its number-one customer, distributing around 80 percent of the world's supply. It's why, despite the 20-year international patent expiring by 2018, very few alternative products have emerged, as they must meet strict technical composition guidelines set by the WHO and UNICEF. Amid mounting evidence of widespread starvation and famine, these sachets are the number one treatment, says Emmanuel Berbain, nutrition adviser at Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). “From what we've seen on the ground, we're in a famine situation already, where deterioration isn't a matter of months, weeks, or days—it's hours.” There were at least 63 malnutrition-related deaths in the Gaza Strip in July, including 24 children under 5, according to data from the WHO. Only four distribution centers are open to feed a population of more than 2 million. Berbain says plenty of RUTF sachets lie at Israel's borders. More than 6,000 aid trucks, waiting in Egypt and Jordan, some only miles away from the Gazan border, are loaded with emergency food and medicine. But according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa), Israel has denied entry. Authorities have since announced that a daily convoy of 200 aid trucks can enter the strip. “We know how to treat starvation, it's nothing new, and used in nearly every humanitarian crisis this century,” adds Berbain. And a diet of just wheat can lead to malnourishment.” Due to funding cuts, only around 36,000 tons of Plumpy'Nut RUTF was produced worldwide in 2024—approximately 1 million sachets a day. As starvation bites and famine takes hold, MSF nutrition clinics in Gaza are fast running out of RUTF stock, claims Berbain. With global aid distribution networks throttled, one stockpile includes 5,000 tons of Plumpy'Nut, worth $13 million, that could feed more than 484,000 children, according to US manufacturer Edesia. However, due to funding cuts, just 72,000 tons of Nutriset RUTF and supplements were produced worldwide in 2024, half of which was Plumpy'Nut—approximately 1 million sachets a day. US foreign aid cuts are also depleting UNICEF's RUTF stocks. “The pipeline is drying up,” says Kirk Prichard, vice president of programs for humanitarian charity Concern US. The US Department of State, which now administers foreign assistance programs following the official closure of USAID on July 1, didn't respond to a WIRED request for comment. It could be the future of RUTF, provided to children with hidden lactose intolerance or peanut allergies. Collins believes it's symptomatic of a broader problem that's completely man-made: Politics often comes before the lives of innocent, starving people. “Without it, recovery rates will be low and slow.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plain Language SummaryWe provide explanation of spectacular naturally occurring bursts of X-rays and accompanying radio emissions that are observed in association with lightning activity in the Earth's atmosphere. These burst events are commonly referred to as terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs). In geophysical context, the electric field of sufficient magnitude and spatial extent for supporting these avalanches is generated either as an ambient field due to thundercloud electrification or produced in streamer zones of lightning leaders. These electrons radiate energetic photons (X-rays) as they scatter by nuclei of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in air. It has been established recently that these feedback effects occur on very small spatial scales, and in this work, we report the first fully time-dependent simulations of related dynamics, similarity analysis allowing better understanding of characteristics of events observed at different altitudes, and quantitative comparisons with observations.

Maybe it's in your friend's yard year-round, wearing a Santa hat for Christmas and rocking 2025 glasses with a bottle of champagne for the new year. The popular 12-foot skeleton, aptly named Skelly, has become a Halloween classic (and a permanent yard mainstay for the Halloween elite) since it launched in 2020. This year, Home Depot is launching a few new items in its Halloween collection, including a brand-new, tech-powered Ultra Skelly ($279). Ultra Skelly is the souped-up tech edition of original Skelly, with customizable ribcage lights and eyes, four movements it can perform, preset and custom audio recordings it can repeat, a live audio option, and a motion sensor to activate it. It's shorter than the 12-foot icon, but 6 1/2 feet is nothing to scoff at, either. On the visual side, there's a light built into Ultra Skelly's mouth and chest, both of which have a full spectrum of color you can choose from in the newly revamped DecorPro SVI app (Android and iOs), which Home Depot launched last week. The most fun visual, though, is Skelly's new LCD eyes, which feature 18 different styles to choose from. There are also a handful of non-holiday options, like blue, green, and brown eyes. As for the audio and animatronics, Ultra Skelly has four movements with its head, mouth, arm, and torso that you can control. This high-tech skeleton also comes with five preset audio recordings and the ability to record up to 30 seconds of your own audio, which you can manipulate with eerie voice modulation. There's a live audio mode too, if you wanted to speak through Ultra Skelly while sitting out of sight. The DecorPro SVI app works with Bluetooth, so you'll need to be within range to customize Ultra Skelly and use live audio. Ultra Skelly doesn't connect to Wi-Fi, so it's not technically smart, but it still packs plenty of futuristic fun for the holidays. There's a new version of Skelly's best friend: a 5-foot Sitting Skelly's Dog ($249) that will also have customizable eyes. The original 12-foot Skelly ($299) will return, and after a year of price raises across markets, it's nice to see it has actually stayed the same price. This regular Skelly also has customizable LCD eyes, albeit with only eight options. If you're looking for something else fun, don't miss the 15-foot haunted scarecrow ($399), 8-foot animated Wyvern ($399), and so much more.
