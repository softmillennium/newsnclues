Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports from Paris, France on new details in the daring daylight Louvre jewel heist and Interpol's role in tracking the suspects. Following the recent devastating heist at the Louvre in Paris, officials are doubling down on security precautions by implementing new policies and technology that don't come cheap. In an effort to leverage the costs, the Louvre is raising prices by targeting a specific group of visitors. Beginning on Jan. 14, foreigners from outside the European Union will have to pay $12 more than a typical ticket, The Associated Press reported. Tickets will rise from $25 to $37 for non-EU citizens. Nearly 9 million people visited the Louvre in 2024, with 77% of the 8.7 million tourists being of foreign nationality. About 13% of the visitors were American, according to AP. On Oct. 19, a four-person team broke into the Apollo Gallery in broad daylight. A four-person team broke into the Apollo Gallery in broad daylight and stole eight jewels valued collectively at $102 million. Officials recently announced that about 100 cameras will be installed by the end of 2026, while anti-intrusion systems will be running within the next two weeks. Nearly 9 million people visited the Louvre in 2024. Many popular landmarks and museums are looking at their pricing structures — and putting their own citizens first.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luigi Mangione watched stoically Monday as prosecutors played surveillance videos of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing on a New York City sidewalk and of Mangione's arrest five days later at a Pennsylvania McDonald's. NEW YORK (AP) — A Pennsylvania police officer responding to a tip from the manager of a McDonald's testified Tuesday about confronting Luigi Mangione during the intense manhunt last year for UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killer. As soon as Mangione doffed his medical mask at the restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Officer Joseph Detwiler said, “I knew” he was the suspect whose face had been all over the news since the shooting five days earlier on a Manhattan sidewalk. He's real nervous, and he didn't talk too much,” Detwiler told a supervisor by phone from the restaurant parking lot moments after meeting Mangione, according to the officer's body-camera video. It was played in court Tuesday, the second day of a hearing about evidence in the case. Mangione indeed said little initially to Detwiler and another officer, giving only what turned out to be a false name, home state and driver's license. But Detwiler testified that he'd noticed the man's fingers shaking as they interacted and officers patted him down. “I was trying to keep him calm,” Detwiler told the court, adding that he at one point started whistling over the restaurant's holiday-season music to “make him think that nothing was different about this call than any other call.” Lawyers for Mangione, 27, want to block prosecutors from showing or telling jurors at his eventual Manhattan trial about statements he allegedly made and items authorities said they seized from his backpack during his arrest. The objects include a 9 mm handgun that prosecutors say matches the one used in the killing and a notebook in which they say Mangione described his intent to “wack” a health insurance executive. The defense contends the items should be excluded because police didn't get a warrant before searching Mangione's backpack. They also want to suppress some statements Mangione made to law enforcement personnel, such as allegedly giving a false name, because officers started asking questions before telling him he had a right to remain silent. The laws concerning how police interact with potential suspects before reading their rights or obtaining search warrants are complex and often disputed in criminal cases. In Mangione's case, crucial questions will include whether he believed he was free to leave at the point when he spoke to the arresting officers, and whether there were “exigent circumstances” that merited searching his backpack before getting a warrant. Defense lawyers, however, have argued in court filings that officers “strategically” stood in a way that prevented him from leaving. Mangione, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. Mangione's lawyers want to bar evidence from both cases, but this week's hearing pertains only to the state case. Manhattan prosecutors haven't yet laid out their arguments for allowing the disputed evidence. Their federal counterparts have said in court filings that police were justified in searching the backpack to ensure there were no dangerous items and that Mangione's statements to officers were voluntary and made before he was under arrest. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind as the executive walked to a midtown Manhattan hotel for his company's annual investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. Prosecutors say “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase insurance industry critics use to describe how companies avoid paying claims. Thompson, 50, worked at the giant UnitedHealth Group for 20 years and became CEO of its insurance arm in 2021. He was married and had children who were in high school.</p>

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and GOP candidate Matt Van Epps discuss Trump's decision to halt Afghan immigration applications following the D.C. National Guardsmen attack and the upcoming Tennessee special election on ‘The Will Cain Show.' Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., accused House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., of siding with Democrats over Republicans in a heated public statement on Tuesday. Stefanik, whom Johnson appointed as chairwoman of House GOP leadership earlier this year, claimed Johnson was blocking a provision in the annual defense policy bill that would allow Republicans to get revenge for being targeted in alleged instances of government weaponization. Johnson called Stefanik's accusations "false" in comments to reporters on Tuesday morning and said he would support such a measure. Rep. Elise Stefanik attacked Speaker Mike Johnson on X with accusations the House GOP leader called "false." The confrontation first began on Monday evening, when Stefanik posted on X, "Republicans have the House, Senate, and the White House, yet the deep state is alive and well with the Speaker getting rolled by House Dems attempting to block my provision to require Congressional disclosure when the FBI opens counterintelligence investigations into presidential and federal candidates seeking office." She pointed to ex-FBI Director James Comey's 2017 testimony when Stefanik said he "admitted to not following proper notification procedures" when opening the investigation into whether the 2016 Trump campaign colluded with Russia. The legislation is all the more important now, Stefanik added, with revelations that ex-Special Counsel Jack Smith seized phone records of some Republican lawmakers without their knowledge during his own probe of President Donald Trump. The NDAA is responsible for setting national security and defense policies for the federal government every year. A concurring defense spending bill funds those policies. Stefanik's threat is particularly notable coming from a member of the House Armed Services Committee, where the NDAA originates. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing in Washington, Jan. 21, 2025. She followed her post with a similar accusation on Tuesday morning, "I just walked out of a briefing on this issue this morning CONFIRMING everything I posted yesterday." "That yes, in fact, the Speaker is blocking my provision to root out the illegal weaponization that led to Crossfire Hurricane, Arctic Frost, and more. He is siding with [Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.] This bill is [dead on arrival] unless this provision gets added in as it was passed out of committee," she said. Johnson suggested he was blindsided by the attacks when asked during his weekly press conference on Tuesday. One of her provisions is not being made, I think, into the NDAA. This hasn't even made it to my level," Johnson said. "The way regular order works is – and I think she should know this, we'll be talking about it, I'm sure today — the way this works is that, it has to go through committees of jurisdiction if it will be attached to the NDAA. And this provision that she's working on, I think is under the jurisdiction of judiciary." "Well, in this case — I found out last night, this wasn't even on my radar — that apparently didn't happen," he said. "It doesn't mean it can't become law or even that that is a final decision. But I sent my friend Elise a text last night and I said, 'Can you find out what the issue was, and I'll help you resolve it?' So I don't know why she's frustrated with me. I literally had nothing to do with it. But I'm happy to roll up my sleeves and help her."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pope Leo has said he believes the United States needs to find “another way” in handling the situation in Venezuela, warning against any military incursion and saying it would be better to pursue dialogue or apply economic pressure. “It seems there is the possibility that there be some activity, even an operation to invade Venezuelan territory,” Leo, who spent several years as a missionary and bishop in Peru, told reporters on board the papal plane returning to Rome from Beirut on Tuesday. He noted that US President Donald Trump and his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolás Maduro had spoken on the phone and that because “the voices that come from the US change, with some frequency sometimes, one needs to see.” During an in-flight press conference covering a range of topics, Leo also called for Europe and North America to be “a little less fearful” when it comes to immigrants of different faiths. Asked about Catholics who see Islam as a “threat” to Christianity in Europe, Leo said he is aware of people's fears, but said they are often “generated by people who are against immigration and trying to keep out people who may be from another country, another religion, another race.” He said the lessons from Lebanon need to be “heard in Europe or North America, that we should perhaps be a little less fearful and look for ways of promoting authentic dialogue and respect.” His comments on migration come less than a week after Trump said he was considering permanently banning immigration from what he called “third world countries.” The pope also stressed the importance of Europe in forging a peace plan for Ukraine, amid talks taking place between US envoys and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday. While he has adopted the same priorities as his predecessor, Leo has a more low-key, formal style, with some wondering how he will address the church's major challenges. Leo spent time with reporters on the way out to Turkey last week, talking about Wordle, wishing American journalists on board a happy Thanksgiving, and being handed pumpkin pies. While some have remarked on his inscrutability, Leo cited a book, which he said would help understand him better. He said: “if you want to know something about me, that's been my spirituality for many years”, adding that it helped him while in Peru “during years of terrorism” and various different assignments. Leo's decision to hold a press conference on the way back from Lebanon, continues in the steps of his predecessors including Pope Francis who frequently made notable interventions during his in-flight press conferences.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses the D.C. National Guard ambush, broader concerns over Biden-era Afghan vetting and migration pauses from high-risk countries. After an Afghan asylee allegedly shot two West Virginia National Guardsmen on Wednesday, President Donald Trump ordered U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow to commence a "full-scale, rigorous reexamination" of green-card holders from "countries of concern." The directive highlights the legal avenues through which a green card — lawful permanent residence granted through an Adjustment of Status application — can be withdrawn, and those through which it cannot. There are several major ways lawful permanent residency can be revoked. Several immigration law firms — including Sedki and Rebecca Black — cite similar orders and descriptions on their sites, and related details appear across various federal webpages, but Fox News Digital did not find any single official source that consolidates them. First, green-card holders can be placed in removal proceedings if they are convicted of certain crimes – including "aggravated felonies" such as murder, some serious sex and drug-trafficking offenses, as well as crimes involving moral turpitude like certain theft, fraud or violent-offense convictions, depending on the sentence and timing. Protest signs on the Capitol lawn, left, and a US Air Force jet with Afghan evacuees in 2021, right. They can also lose their green cards over convictions connected to terrorism or espionage for foreign governments. Green-card holders also cannot vote in federal elections, and convictions connected to attempts to do so can also result in revocation of their residency status. A second basis for withdrawal is evidence that the noncitizen obtained the green card through fraud or misrepresentation. Examples include foreign nationals who used identity theft, lied on their applications, or omitted parts of their criminal history or prior contact with U.S. immigration authorities. USCIS may also revisit Adjustment of Status applications for lawful permanent residents who became such through a marriage that ends in divorce within two years. The agency can revoke a green card if it is found the foreign national married a U.S. citizen strictly in order to achieve residency. Home address issues and questions arising out of where – including in which country – a green-card holder truly resides can also be grounds for revocation. Lawful permanent residents must be just that: people residing permanently in the U.S. with a primary residence stateside. Changes of address within the U.S. must also be reported to USCIS. While most people who would fall under the subsection have since died or would be in their 90s at the least, a Cold War provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) bars any noncitizen who, between March 1933 and May 1945, participated in or ordered persecutions under Germany's Nazi regime or in German-occupied territories. Relatedly, any immigrant who has been affiliated with communism or any "totalitarian party" in another country, is also banned from holding a green card. One avenue the Trump administration, however, may pursue as it commences a full-scale review of green-card holders from Afghanistan and other "countries of concern" is the final major way residency status may be questioned or revoked: what some firms describe as the public charge rule. According to various immigration law firms' websites, such residents relying too heavily on public assistance and government programs may find themselves in removal proceedings if they are "deemed a public charge" under the law – but with a key caveat. Under the INA, simply receiving public benefits does not make a noncitizen deportable. They must have become a public charge within five years of admission "from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen since entry." Additionally, relevant to Trump's Afghan example, any noncitizen previously arrested or deported from the U.S., or removed as an "enemy" or at government expense in lieu of deportation, may not hold a green card. While many of the Afghan refugees reportedly came with little to no documentation at the time of the mass withdrawal from Kabul, the INA also prescribes that foreign nationals who were never qualified to obtain full citizenship for various reasons are also ineligible for lawful permanent residence. While former President Joe Biden's Operation Welcoming Heroes was an official mission, 8 USC Sec 1182(a) 5(d) also lays out how "any alien who is a stowaway is excludable." That definition would likely be up to legal interpretation, as the current administration signals a no-holds barred audit of current green-card holders. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House, DOJ, DHS and officials at USCIS for comment and clarification on any of the major grounds collected for a green card's withdrawal. In comments to CBS News, Edlow said his agency has followed the president's order and "halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible. Trump quoted the INA inasmuch as: "Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate."

The directive highlights the legal avenues through which a green card — lawful permanent residence granted through an Adjustment of Status application — can be withdrawn, and those through which it cannot. There are several major ways lawful permanent residency can be revoked. Several immigration law firms — including Sedki and Rebecca Black — cite similar orders and descriptions on their sites, and related details appear across various federal webpages, but Fox News Digital did not find any single official source that consolidates them. First, green-card holders can be placed in removal proceedings if they are convicted of certain crimes – including "aggravated felonies" such as murder, some serious sex and drug-trafficking offenses, as well as crimes involving moral turpitude like certain theft, fraud or violent-offense convictions, depending on the sentence and timing. Protest signs on the Capitol lawn, left, and a US Air Force jet with Afghan evacuees in 2021, right. They can also lose their green cards over convictions connected to terrorism or espionage for foreign governments. Green-card holders also cannot vote in federal elections, and convictions connected to attempts to do so can also result in revocation of their residency status. A second basis for withdrawal is evidence that the noncitizen obtained the green card through fraud or misrepresentation. Examples include foreign nationals who used identity theft, lied on their applications, or omitted parts of their criminal history or prior contact with U.S. immigration authorities. USCIS may also revisit Adjustment of Status applications for lawful permanent residents who became such through a marriage that ends in divorce within two years. The agency can revoke a green card if it is found the foreign national married a U.S. citizen strictly in order to achieve residency. Home address issues and questions arising out of where – including in which country – a green-card holder truly resides can also be grounds for revocation. Lawful permanent residents must be just that: people residing permanently in the U.S. with a primary residence stateside. Changes of address within the U.S. must also be reported to USCIS. While most people who would fall under the subsection have since died or would be in their 90s at the least, a Cold War provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) bars any noncitizen who, between March 1933 and May 1945, participated in or ordered persecutions under Germany's Nazi regime or in German-occupied territories. Relatedly, any immigrant who has been affiliated with communism or any "totalitarian party" in another country, is also banned from holding a green card. One avenue the Trump administration, however, may pursue as it commences a full-scale review of green-card holders from Afghanistan and other "countries of concern" is the final major way residency status may be questioned or revoked: what some firms describe as the public charge rule. According to various immigration law firms' websites, such residents relying too heavily on public assistance and government programs may find themselves in removal proceedings if they are "deemed a public charge" under the law – but with a key caveat. Under the INA, simply receiving public benefits does not make a noncitizen deportable. They must have become a public charge within five years of admission "from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen since entry." Additionally, relevant to Trump's Afghan example, any noncitizen previously arrested or deported from the U.S., or removed as an "enemy" or at government expense in lieu of deportation, may not hold a green card. While many of the Afghan refugees reportedly came with little to no documentation at the time of the mass withdrawal from Kabul, the INA also prescribes that foreign nationals who were never qualified to obtain full citizenship for various reasons are also ineligible for lawful permanent residence. While former President Joe Biden's Operation Welcoming Heroes was an official mission, 8 USC Sec 1182(a) 5(d) also lays out how "any alien who is a stowaway is excludable." That definition would likely be up to legal interpretation, as the current administration signals a no-holds barred audit of current green-card holders. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House, DOJ, DHS and officials at USCIS for comment and clarification on any of the major grounds collected for a green card's withdrawal. In comments to CBS News, Edlow said his agency has followed the president's order and "halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible. Trump quoted the INA inasmuch as: "Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is recommending that the Trump administration's travel ban list include between 30 to 32 countries, marking an increase from the current list of 19 countries, according to a source familiar with the matter. The source said the list could continue to expand based on ongoing assessments, but it is unclear which countries are being added to the list — and when they'll be announced. Noem said Monday that, following a meeting with President Donald Trump, she recommended a “full travel ban” on “every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.” The current list of 19 countries with full or partial restrictions include Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Trump has previously said that some countries had “deficient” screening for passports and other public documents or have historically refused to take back their own citizens. Last week, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that it will reexamine all green cards issued to people from the 19 countries currently facing full or partial travel restrictions. The agency's director, Joe Edlow, also announced updated guidance that authorizes USCIS officers “to consider country-specific factors as significant negative factors when reviewing immigration requests.” A day later, Edlow announced the US was pausing all asylum decisions “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.” Trump has also threatened to “permanently pause” migration from what he called “third-world countries,” without specifying which countries he was referring to — a move Noem defended on Sunday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Legal experts say the U.S. military would have committed a crime if survivors were killed. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins referenced it Tuesday as a lingering issue for American farmers. She said the economic “destruction” over which Biden presided increased costs for the nation's farmers, calling them “massive numbers that will take some time to get out from under.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also called affordability a “crisis.” And Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner referenced affordability in the context of hundreds of thousands of Americans he said were able to become first-time homebuyers recently. Brooke Rollins told Trump during the Cabinet meeting that he's been opening overseas markets for U.S. farmers to help them become less reliant on government assistance. The president said Tuesday that his administration will embark on a reconstruction of Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia. It's a terrible airport,” Trump said during his Cabinet meeting. The real estate mogul-turned-president said it was “incorrectly designed,” even as he praised Eero Saarinen, the Finnish-American architect who designed its main terminal. “We're gonna make that into something really spectacular. We have an amazing plan for it,” Trump said. One of the “people movers” that ferry travelers between Dulles concourses crashed in November. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said his agency will announce a request for bids later Tuesday to repair the “mobile lounges.” The Virginia senator's campaign announcement says he's running to rein in America's economic crisis, particularly regarding the impact of artificial intelligence on job displacement. According to the Cook Political Report, Warner represents a solidly Democratic seat. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks as President Donald Trump looks on, during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025, in Washington. Such a change requires an act of Congress that hasn't occurred. Trump called on Hegseth to speak first as each Cabinet member gave brief presentations. Neither Trump nor Hegseth mentioned the nameplate misspelling, but online posters were quick to point it out. Andrew Wolfe remains hospitalized following the pre-Thanksgiving shooting in Washington. Seated once again at Trump's left, Hegseth said the Department of Defense is getting back to its basics, which he said includes “lethality.” Hegseth's presence in the Cabinet Room is attracting extra attention as the Pentagon faces bipartisan scrutiny for a follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat in September. Trump did not mention the strikes during his lengthy intro. Navy Vice Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, who White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said ordered the second strike, is expected to provide a classified briefing Thursday to lawmakers overseeing the military. “We always have the back of our commanders,” Hegseth said. Trump raised the subject of his White House renovation projects as he spoke during what he said is the year's final Cabinet meeting. “Every time I hear them, I love the sound,” Trump said, jokingly adding that he wouldn't say his wife, Melania Trump, is as “thrilled” as he is by the noise. Leo XVI has called for the United States to pursue dialogue and even economic pressure on Venezuela to achieve its goals, rather than threats of military action. Since his return to office, Trump said Tuesday that global respect for the United States has gone up, taking a moment to swipe at former Democratic President Joe Biden for putting the country in “great danger.” Trump noted the ongoing diplomatic efforts in which U.S. officials have been speaking with Ukrainian and Russian counterparts in efforts to end that war. A U.S. delegation was in Moscow Tuesday sitting down with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Sunday, U.S. and Ukrainian officials completed roughly four hours of talks in Florida. “You people are crazy,” Trump said, addressing reporters in the room. President Donald Trump, right center, speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025, in Washington. Trump said at his Cabinet meeting that next year he'll be “giving back refunds out of the tariffs because we've taken in literally trillions dollars.” It's not clear how that would work or if Trump could afford to do so without worsening the national debt, which he claims his tariffs will also cut. But it's not trillions, and it's not clear how Trump could refund the taxes he imposed unilaterally by declaring an economic emergency. Still, Trump said he's banking on tariffs supplanting income taxes, so much so that “at some point in the not too distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay.” FILE - Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., speaks during a news conference after a democratic caucus meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2025. Lieu, who served in the United States Air Force JAG corps, said killing shipwreck survivors is a war crime. He said the DOJ's investigation should also include a review of Hegseth's actions as defense secretary. “If the Trump administration does not hold the people accountable, I guarantee you a future administration will do so because there is no statute of limitations for war crimes,” Lieu said. But that's in contrast with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has declined to say whether he will allow a vote on a health care bill. It's no secret that Trump is counting the days until Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's term expires in May. The Defense secretary is sitting in his usual seat, at Trump's left. President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025, in Washington, as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth looks on. The GOP leader said as far as he can tell it was Admiral Bradley's decision to strike the boat a second time. “He made that call,” Johnson said at his weekly press conference. “I don't know what went into the Admiral's decision,” he added, but he said, the incident is “something Congress will look at.” Johnson demurred when asked if the video tape should be made available for review. “I don't know how much of that tape should be released, because I'm not sure how much is sensitive with regard to national security,” he said. President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025, in Washington, as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth looks on. Trump has begun by talking about what he says is a historic $18 trillion in investments in the United States, citing money spent in the country from other nations, as well as what he said was record spending on Black Friday. Responding to the use of her song “Juno” in a video montage depicting ICE raids, Carpenter tweeted Tuesday: “this video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.” And on Monday, “Franklin the Turtle” publisher Kids Can Press condemned Hegseth's post on X of a manipulated image showing Franklin aiming a bazooka at boats. “We strongly condemn any denigrating, violent, or unauthorized use of Franklin's name or image, which directly contradicts these values,” the publisher said in a tweet. Wilson began with attacks on Democratic lawmakers and mainstream media. She also maintained the Trump administration's assertions that the U.S. military's attacks on alleged drug boats off the Venezuela coast are “lawful.” At least 83 people have been killed in at least 21 strikes in a campaign now facing House and Senate scrutiny. Jeff Landry speaks to reporters at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, La., Sept. 3, 2025. Jeff Landry said he received that commitment from Trump himself. “He said, ‘Don't worry Jeff, we'll have them there in two weeks,'” Landry said, recounting a Monday morning phone call with Trump. “Special elections are strange animals and anything can happen,” Johnson said. Johnson said at his Tuesday press conference that he spent nearly 10 hours in the district the day before, holding nearly a dozen events. Speaker Mike Johnson says “we didn't commit to that” when asked whether House Republicans would pursue a short-term extension of health care subsidies before they soon expire. Johnson's comment comes as he spoke to reporters Tuesday. Some of the Republicans in key swing districts have been calling for a short-term extension to prevent premiums from soaring next year for thousands of their constituents. But time is running short as lawmakers wrap up their work before the holiday break. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson speaks during a news conference at the Capitol Hill Club on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025, in Washington. Johnson said only a small percentage of Americans are affected by the subsidy increases kicking in next year for those on Affordable Care Act exchanges. Now, every American, 100% of Americans need their health care costs to come down. Now, what I've got to do is build consensus deliberately around the best ideas.” FILE - Members of the Pentagon press corp walk out of the Pentagon as a group after turning in their press credentials, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025 in Washington. Most of the Pentagon's press corps turned in their access badges rather than submit to new rules restricting what they can report. It's also being broadcast on the Pentagon's website, among other places. The Pentagon's last on-camera press briefing was in June after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. This briefing comes amid increasing scrutiny of U.S. military strikes against alleged drug boats off Venezuela and reports that survivors of one attack were killed in what may have been a criminal act. Several conservative news outlets and internet influencers agreed to the new press policy. U.S.-operated flights returning deported migrants to Venezuela will continue despite Trump's assertion that the airspace of the South American country should be viewed as closed. More than 13,000 migrants have been deported to Venezuela this year on dozens of chartered flights after Maduro, under pressure from the White House, did away with his long-standing policy of not accepting deportees from the U.S. The flights have continued despite U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean and off Venezuela's Caribbean coast. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Democratic candidate, state Rep. Aftyn Behn, for comments she made about Nashville during a 2020 podcast in which she said “I hate country music.” A faith-based pregnancy center will ask the justices on Tuesday to block a state investigation into whether it misled people to discourage abortions. Many Democratic-aligned states have sought to protect abortion access and some have investigated whether pregnancy centers mislead women into thinking they offer abortions. New Jersey's attorney general Matthew Platkin sent a subpoena to First Choice Women's Resource Centers for donor information. Brian Finucane, now a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group, said the U.S. is not in an armed conflict with drug cartels, and “the term for a premeditated killing outside of armed conflict is murder. “Murder on the high seas is a crime,” he said. “Conspiracy to commit murder outside of the United States is a crime. And under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 118 makes murder an offense.” Juan Orlando Hernández was serving a 45 year sentence for helping drug traffickers move some 400 tons of cocaine to the United States. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons confirmed Tuesday that he was released from a prison in Hazelton, West Virginia following a pardon from Trump. “After almost four years of pain, of waiting and difficult challenges, my husband Juan Orlando Hernández RETURNED to being a free man, thanks to the presidential pardon granted by President Donald Trump,” his wife Ana García posted Tuesday. Asked why he did it, Trump said Sunday that people in Honduras told him Hernández had been falsely accused in “a Biden administration set-up.” Michael Schmitt, a former Air Force lawyer and professor emeritus at the U.S. Naval War College, said it doesn't matter whether the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels, as the Trump administration asserts — he says such a fatal second strike would have violated both peacetime laws and those governing armed conflict. “I can't imagine anyone, no matter what the circumstance, believing it is appropriate to kill people who are clinging to a boat in the water,” said Schmitt. “It has been clear for well over a century that you may not declare what's called ‘no quarter' — take no survivors, kill everyone,” he said.

Vox received a grant from Arnold Ventures to support this project, though Vox retains full editorial control over all content produced as part of the project. “This generous grant from Arnold Ventures will allow us to dig into some of the most pressing questions in policy, surface undercovered ideas, and inform the national conversation in this crucial moment in our politics.” The initiative spans two major editorial packages, podcast series, live events, and a forthcoming newsletter product. The project aims to serve as a resource for lawmakers, government officials, policy thinkers, scholars, journalists, and others shaping the national conversation around America's capacity to build. This series will explore why the US turned away from a growth-oriented mindset and why doubling back down on growth — in energy solutions; in productivity; in technology; and ultimately, in the economy — is the only way out of a zero-sum politics that has paralyzed the country. The second package, How They Built It, will debut in 2026. This case-study series will examine what the United States can learn from countries that have successfully built infrastructure faster, cleaner, and more affordably — and what it would take to apply those lessons at home. The project will also include a Today, Explained podcast miniseries; an interview series on The Gray Area; a new newsletter focused on infrastructure and building policy launching in 2026; and a series of salon-style live events exploring these topics, taking place in 2026 and 2027.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andrew Wolfe, the 24-year-old National Guard member who was injured in an ambush-style shooting in Washington, DC, last Wednesday, remains in serious condition but has shown “positive” signs of recovery, West Virginia Gov. “My biggest message is Andrew is still fighting for his life,” Morrisey said at a news conference on Monday. The governor said his office was told that when a nurse asked Wolfe to give a thumbs up if he could hear, “he did respond.” “And we were told that he also wiggled his toes, so we take that as a positive sign,” Morrisey added. Wolfe's parents have asked for continued prayers as their son fights to recover, he said. Wolfe, a US Air Force staff sergeant, was shot and injured while deployed to Washington, DC, as part of the Trump administration's efforts to reduce crime. A fellow West Virginia National Guard member, Sarah Beckstrom, was also shot in the attack. Morrisey remembered Beckstrom as “an amazing woman who lifted up people.” “She is someone who is going to be remembered for a very, very long time, and she had her life tragically cut short,” the governor added. He applied for asylum in 2024, and it was granted earlier this year under the Trump administration. The suspect faces at least one first-degree murder charge, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro, told Fox News on Friday, adding, “There are certainly many more charges to come.” At Monday's news conference, Morrisey emphasized that guard members volunteered to be deployed to the nation's capital and said 170 members of the state's National Guard remain in Washington, DC, to support local law enforcement. He said his office does “not have a specific date in mind” for when those troops will return to West Virginia. Initially, a statement from Morrisey's office indicated that both guard members had been killed, but it was later corrected. “I could tell you that the process is that we try to get as much information as we can, accurate information, from the most credible sources,” Morrisey said. “In this case, that information was incorrect and then within 20 minutes we changed it.” City officials had argued in a lawsuit against the troops' deployment, saying it undermined the city's autonomy and was unnecessary.</p>

As the writer of an ethical advice column, I get a lot of questions from people who really want to do good in the world but are running into problems. So, in honor of Giving Tuesday, I've combed through all the advice I've given over the past year and created this cheat sheet for you. It's packed with my top tips, as well as my favorite quotes about the philosophy of doing good. I grew up in a family on welfare. I put every penny I got straight into a savings account, and my child-brain whined with anxiety when I saw my dad occasionally donate to others (what if we need that money? As an adult, I was lucky to get jobs that paid decently. It helped that rigorous charity evaluators had come on the scene, so I could feel confident that certain nonprofits would put my money to good use. And it helped to learn that even a modest donation can do serious good. For just $94, say, you can keep a child from starving. Giving felt so good, not only because I knew it was helping others, but because it reminded my brain that I'm not a solitary, atomized being; I'm connected to everyone else. As weird as it may sound, Giving Tuesday actually became one of my favorite days of the year. The British philosopher Derek Parfit once beautifully described his own experience undergoing this shift: My life seemed like a glass tunnel, through which I was moving faster every year, and at the end of which there was darkness. There is still a difference between my life and the lives of other people. I am less concerned about the rest of my own life, and more concerned about the lives of others. I'm very grateful that we have charity evaluators whose entire job it is to find the nonprofits that genuinely do a lot of good with each dollar. Some nonprofits are much more effective than others trying to achieve the same goal, and all things being equal, we don't want to blow all our money on the wildly ineffective ones. So, optimization definitely has its place in the world of charity, and I recommend giving generously to the “best buys” for improving people's well-being. But, I would caution you not to stretch optimization beyond its optimal limits. How do you compare, say, preventing malaria with alleviating depression? There is no objective One True Answer here. How to rank these different goods depends on each person's subjective philosophical assumptions. So, we need to give up the fantasy that there's some magic formula that can tell us how to optimize “the good” overall. It means the best you can do might be to consider how compelling you find the case for each one and divvy up your budget accordingly. For example, I give about 85 percent of my charity each year to highly cost-effective organizations abroad like GiveDirectly and StrongMinds, because I know my money goes further in developing countries and I believe all lives are equally important. Notice that some of these don't submit easily to quantification, and some aren't about furthering strictly “moral” goods. One of my touchstones is contemporary philosopher Susan Wolf's concept of the “moral saint” — someone who tries to make all their actions as morally good as possible. Wolf argues that this is actually a bad ideal. We often think of “virtue” as being connected to morality, but Wolf's point is that there are also non-moral virtues, like artistic beauty. If you ignore those, you end up bereft of the things that make up a life well lived: A life in which none of these possible aspects of character are developed may seem to be a life strangely barren. I think that holds true both for how you spend your time and how you spend your money. I encounter a lot of people who give so much of their time and money that they become overextended and resentful. Pop psychology would say these people need to get better at asserting “personal boundaries” — at drawing a sharp line between themselves and others. But, if you believe, as I do, that we're all actually profoundly interconnected and interdependent, then that idea of boundaries may feel like an unconvincing reason to practice self-preservation. Instead, I think it's better to picture yourself as part of Indra's net. According to that classic Buddhist metaphor, an infinite net stretches out across the universe (a bit like a spiderweb). Allan Watts, an American popularizer of Eastern philosophy, described it beautifully: Imagine a multidimensional spider's web in the early morning covered with dew drops. Because each dew drop (or jewel) contains the image of every other dew drop (or jewel) in the entire net, none of them exists as a separate, boundaried entity. You're also diminishing every other bright spot in the net. Giving money to charity can do a lot of good. That doesn't mean it's the only way to do good. The religion places a high premium on monetary charity, known as zakat. And notice how it's arguably even more morally demanding than monetary charity. All charity requires is writing a check — an action that can be done dispassionately, and even effortlessly for someone lucky enough to have money. It doesn't require commitment to a broader project of solidarity or justice. In fact, a common critique of charity is it can serve as a distraction from the unjust ways that wealth is created. But sadaqah requires you to be engaged, emotionally and often physically, too. So, if you know people who don't donate money to charity, by all means, encourage them. Research suggests the most effective way to do this is to meet them with positive regard and empathy (not pressure or judginess) and to emphasize the joy you get out of giving (not the moral case for it). But above all, don't assume that they're not already doing a lot of good. They may be engaged in a different but equally valid practice of solidarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tuesday's special election in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, normally a conservative stronghold, is giving Democrats hope that their recently successful message of affordability can help them spring a major upset. The contest pits Trump-backed Republican Matt Van Epps against Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn. The winner will replace former Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July. A month after Democrats running on cost-of-living issues won in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia, both Van Epps and Behn have campaigned on affordability. Reflecting the Republican concerns about a district Green won last year by nearly 22 points, President Donald Trump called into events for Van Epps on Monday and House Speaker Mike Johnson visited Tennessee to campaign with him. Democrats have beaten their 2024 margins in US House special elections this year by an average of 16 points. A Democratic victory on Tuesday or even outperforming last year's results would further embolden Trump's opponents heading into the midterms. “Having had the privilege of representing Tennessee in years past, I want to tell you that I have never seen the political tides shift as far and as fast as we're seeing them move in this election,” said Al Gore, who represented the state in the US Senate before becoming vice president, at a virtual rally Monday night for Behn. At a campaign event earlier Monday, Johnson held a mic to his phone so the president could be heard exhorting the crowd to vote on Tuesday. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene also plans to resign in January. “Right now, every single seat matters, and this special election will fill an important one for us,” Johnson told reporters Monday night after an event in Clarksville. Van Epps, a former Army helicopter pilot and state Department of General Services commissioner, isn't conceding the issue to Behn, arguing in ads that Democrats will raise costs and taxes. “Affordability is top of our list, and I'm excited to fight alongside the president and the speaker to drive down cost of living,” Van Epps told reporters Monday night. Van Epps and his allies have also attacked Behn as out of step with the conservative-leaning district. In ads and social media posts, Republicans have highlighted past comments from Behn where she called herself a “very radical person,” expressed support for defunding the police and said she hates Nashville, parts of which she now represents in the state legislature and are in the 7th District. A recent Van Epps TV ad brands Behn a “radical disaster” and says that “Tennessee can't afford (Democrats') radical agenda” of “new taxes that would crush working families.” In an interview with CNN's Manu Raju, Aftyn Behn, the Democratic nominee for next week's special election in a heavily Republican Tennessee congressional district, responds to comments she made on a 2020 podcast episode about Nashville. She said decisions about law enforcement funding should be made locally. Behn said her past comments about disliking country music and Nashville came from frustration with the city's tourism industry, notably the bachelorette parties that are ubiquitous in downtown. “(Republicans) must've loved Nashville so much they cut our congressional district (into) the three Republican districts,” Behn quipped, referencing the state's previous congressional map, which included a single district covering Nashville before it was redrawn after the 2020 Census. The 7th District now runs top-to-bottom through middle Tennessee and includes corners of Nashville. Between Democratic over-performance in special elections this year and the historically narrow Republican House majority, Tuesday's race has become a magnet for outside spending from both parties. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, progressive Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas and Democratic Party Chair Ken Martin have made appearances supporting Behn. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined the virtual rally for Behn Monday night along with Gore. Ocasio-Cortez described talking to Behn about a week ago and credited her courage for running in what was once seen as a safe Republican seat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now it faces a congressional investigation over its financial situation. The Republican-led House Committee on Education and Workforce, in a Nov. 20 letter, alleged that this “strips dues-paying members of their basic right to understand how their money is spent” and runs afoul of the organization's bylaws, which require such audits regularly. Since June 2019, the amount of money the union has given to liberal politicians and political action committees, other than its own, has been steadily increasing. In 2019, the Chicago Teachers Union's political action committee, receiving funding from the union treasury, spent $1.7 million on donations to candidates for public office. Some individuals that the Chicago Teachers Union threw the most money behind, such as school board candidates Jason Dones and Felix Ponce, who ultimately failed to win election to office. Johnson and DeBerry, meanwhile, have been staunch allies of the teachers union. Analyses from the Illinois Policy Institute have found that the union spending on representational activities, operations associated with representing workers, declined from just 20% in 2024 to 18% in 2025. Furthermore, an inspector general's report released on November 12 found that Chicago Public Schools staff spent $7 million in COVID-19 relief funds on trips to international destinations, stays in luxury hotels, and Las Vegas conferences. “By withholding complete financial audits from its members, CTU has failed to uphold the spirit of union transparency or comply with its own bylaws,” the House Committee on Education and Workforce wrote in its November 20 letter to the Chicago Teachers Union. “As such, the Committee is investigating this matter to better determine whether the [Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act] should be amended to strengthen its requirements so that union members have access to more robust and timely financial information. Every dollar paid by workers should serve their interests, not those of a select few operating in the shadows.” Indeed, we have already been in touch with Committee staff regarding the schedule for producing responsive documents and will produce them on or before December 22. We are confident that our responses will fully answer any legitimate questions and address the allegations contained in your letter.”</p>

Elise Stefanik (R-NY) blasted House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and House Republicans for Democrats seeking to block an amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act that Stefanik advocated. Her provision would require notifying Congress if the FBI investigates candidates running for president and other federal offices. She accused Johnson and the GOP of “getting rolled” by House Democrats in an X post on Monday. Stefanik said she would vote against the legislation if her provision were not “added back.” She called such investigations and law abuses criminal acts that can “never happen again.” “In a March 2017 open hearing, my questions to former FBI Director James Comey began the unraveling of the Russia Hoax when Comey admitted to not following proper notification procedures with his illegal opening of Crossfire Hurricane,” Stefanik said. If Republicans can't deliver accountability and legislative fixes to arguably the biggest illegal corruption and government weaponization issue of all time, then what are we even doing.” She also cited the recent leaks of conversations between foreign governments and U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff. She emphasized that removing her provision would be detrimental to accountability and threaten national security. “It is a scandalous disgrace that Republicans are allowing themselves to be rolled by the Dems and deep state on this,” Stefanik concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An oil tanker is moored at the Sheskharis oil and petroleum complex on the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, Russia, Oct. 11, 2022. ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — A tanker carrying sunflower oil from Russia to Georgia was attacked in the Black Sea, the Turkish maritime authority said Tuesday, days after two Russian “shadow fleet” oil tankers were attacked by Ukrainian naval drones. It was heading toward the Turkish port of Sinop, the maritime authority said in a statement on X. On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke out against Ukraine's drone attack on two Russian vessels, the Kairos and Virat, saying it signaled a “worrying escalation” of the conflict. “We cannot condone these attacks, which threaten navigational safety, life, and the environment, especially in our own exclusive zone,” Erdogan said in a televised address. “We are issuing the necessary warnings to all parties regarding such situations.” Friday's attacks against the Kairos and Virat occurred inside Turkey's exclusive economic zone. Crew members on board both vessels were reported to be safe. The OpenSanctions database, which tracks people or organizations involved in sanctions evasion, describes the vessels as part of a fleet of ships used to evade sanctions imposed on Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine has carried out successful naval strikes against Russian shipping during the war, particularly using explosives-packed marine drones. However, Ukrainian missions have previously largely been limited to the waters of the northern Black Sea.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump and top Republicans made a last-ditch push on Monday to prevent embarrassment in a hotly contested Tennessee special election for Congress. Republican Matt Van Epps faces Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn. The Associated Press reporter Jonathan Mattise explains Tennessee's special congressional election that has the Democrat Aftyn Behn, a 36-year-old liberal state representative, and Republican Matt Van Epps, a combat veteran, neck to neck in polls.

(AP Photo/George Walker IV) FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) — A Tennessee congressional seat that President Donald Trump and Republicans have previously won with ease became the unlikely epicenter of the fight for Congress on Monday, as House Speaker Mike Johnson headlined rallies and former Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told Democrats they could be on the verge of a monumental upset. Trump even called in twice during the day to tell voters to back Matt Van Epps, the Republican candidate, in Tuesday's special election. “The whole world is watching Tennessee right now, and they're watching your district,” the president said after Johnson put him on speakerphone during an event inside a garage stocked with vintage cars on a supporters' sprawling farm in Franklin. Behn, a self-proclaimed “pissed-off social worker” and progressive community organizer from Nashville, sprinted through her final campaign stops, including the virtual rally with Gore, a Tennessee native, and Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Gore said people are struggling with high costs for groceries and health care while Trump is running “by far, the most corrupt administration in history,” enabled in Congress by “way too many subservient cowards.” “Having had the privilege of representing Tennessee in years past, I want to tell you that I have never seen the political tides shift as far and as fast as we're seeing them move in this election,” Gore said. Behn has been described by some state Democrats as “our very own AOC of TN,” a nickname that Republicans have harnessed to deride Behn as too far left for the district. Republicans have expressed concerns about turnout because early voting went into Thanksgiving week and Election Day follows the holiday weekend. Van Epps was supported by a phalanx of party leaders on Monday, including national chairman Joe Gruters, Gov. “I think that Matt's going to be OK,” Hagerty said. Former Vice President Kamala Harris appeared in Nashville to rally voters last month while on a book tour, and national party chair Ken Martin visited as well. Behn has condemned Trump's tariffs and tax cut legislation, both of which Van Epps supports. Republicans have tried to turn Behn's own words against her in television advertising, such as when she described herself as a “radical” or claimed to be “bullying” immigration agents and state police officers. A frequent target are comments Behn made about Nashville years ago, when she said “I hate this city” and complained about annoyances like bachelorette parties. For the most part, Behn has answered questions about those remarks by redirecting to cost-of-living issues. Jalen Smalls, a Behn voter, said his primary concern is getting people's basic needs met, such as funding for schools, feeding children, supporting hospitals and maintaining roads. “Those are the bare minimum of what people need in order to thrive, not just survive,” Smalls said. “I feel like Trump is doing a good job, and that's kind of the way we need to go,” he said. “We want to continue the Trump agenda in this district.” The House Majority PAC has put $1 million behind Behn. Van Epps has been backed by more than $1 million from the Trump-supporting MAGA Inc. super PAC. Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries predicted an unexpectedly close race.</p>
