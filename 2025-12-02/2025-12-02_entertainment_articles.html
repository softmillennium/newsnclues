Wordless Music has partnered with A24 and the events company Sister Midnight on a year-long series of screenings with live film scores — and IndieWire shares the details exclusively below. Billed as “Four Nights of A24 Films with Live Scores,” the series will run from February to December 2026 at the United Theater on Broadway in downtown Los Angeles. Tickets will go on sale this Friday, December 5, at 10:00 PST (links below).

Back in 2015, Wordless worked closely with composer Mica Levi on the live orchestra adaptation of her unorthodox “Under the Skin” score, which they are bringing for this series. It's an example of how Givony hopes the tremendous amount of initial legwork that goes into debuting a live event screening — including obtaining a scoreless print of the film and creating up-to-date sheet music to match it — lays the groundwork for there to be more special live orchestra screenings in the future. “In the case of ‘Hereditary'—most of which was recorded by Colin Stetson himself, using extended/non-traditional technique—we connected Colin with a gifted composer/arranger named Conor Brown, who helped to arrange and orchestrate the music for a live ensemble.” Another key ingredient for Wordless is to stage events at unique venues, for which the United Theater on Broadway (formerly the Theatre at Ace Hotel) qualifies. The 1,600-capacity, ornate Spanish Gothic theater is a former movie palace founded by Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith, and Douglas Fairbanks, as part of their United Artists' attempt to break from the studios. Tickets go on sale December 5 at 10:00 a.m. PST via this page.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bridgerton alum Regé-Jean Page is returning to Netflix as the star and executive producer of erotic thriller series Hancock Park. The project, which I hear landed at Netflix for development in a competitive situation with three major streamers bidding, comes from writer Matthew Barry (Industry), Drew Comins‘ Creative Engine (Yellowjackets) and Fifth Season. According to sources, it has been put on an accelerated development track with a script-to-series commitment. Netflix Snaps Up Action Thriller Spec 'The Operator' From Harrison Query; Mark Wahlberg To Star 'My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman' Sets Season 6 Premiere; MrBeast, Michael B. Jordan & Jason Bateman Join Show The series follows a dangerously charismatic outsider (Page), who invades the lives of a seemingly picture-perfect Los Angeles family when he rents their backyard guest house. In addition to writing, Barry is executive producing alongside Page and his producing partner Emily Brown through their A Mighty Stranger banner and Comins for Creative Engine. Fifth Season, where Comins has a first-look deal, is the studio. Page has the rare distinction of having both a series (Bridgerton Season 1) and a movie (The Gray Man) on Netflix's Top 10 most popular English-language lists. His starring role as the Duke of Hastings on the first season of Netflix's Regency romance drama catapulted Page into global stardom. He has been focused on movies since, starring in The Gray Man opposite Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, Steven Soderbergh's spy thriller Black Bag and Universal's upcoming romantic comedy You, Me & Tuscany, opposite Halle Bailey, which comes out in April. Through A Mighty Stranger, Page and Brown are developing a Count Of Monte Cristo movie at Department M for Page to star and Funny You Should Ask, a TV series adaptation of Elissa Sussman's best-selling novel, which is set up at Apple from Tomorrow Studios, also as a starring vehicle for Page. He is repped by UTA, Brillstein Entertainment Partners, attorney Gregory Slewett and Shelter PR. Welsh writer Barry served as a writer-producer on Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. He recently wrote Men Up, a Welsh TV movie for BBC One, which earned him a writing BAFTA Cymru Award, and the BBC miniseries The Guest. At Netflix, Comins, two-time Emmy nominee for Yellowjackets, also has in the works the UK-based Dangerous Liaisons, from Mood creator and star Nicôle Lecky, which recently opened a writers room, a series adaptation of Adam Silvera's novel They Both Die at the End, with Bridgerton creator Chris Van Dusen writing and Bad Bunny producing, and Lena Dunham's Covers. Additionally, The Holdout, starring Amy Adams, is in development at HBO with Industry creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, and The Stowaway, starring Oscar Isaac, at Apple TV. Comins is repped by CAA and attorney Patti Felker. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The TikTok video shows ICE agents appearing to detain and arrest undocumented people, with Carpenter calling it "evil and disgusting" in an X post on Tuesday (Dec. 2). Editor's note: Shortly after this story posted, Carpenter condemned the clip online. While performing the song “Juno” on her recently wrapped Short ‘n Sweet tour, Sabrina Carpenter would “arrest” a fan or celebrity in the crowd in a fun moment involving pink prop handcuffs. The bit was a viral sensation during the outing that ended last month and it was accompanied by another viral favorite section where Carpenter would ask the crowd if they wanted to try out some “freaky positions,” before busting out a unique pose and saying “Have you ever tried… this one?” On Monday (Dec. 1), the White House once again appropriated a playful pop culture meme to shine a light on its attempt to deport undocumented people. In a 14-second TikTok video cued to “Juno,” a series of people are shown angrily filming ICE agents as they swoop in to arrest people on the street, with close-ups of handcuffs being slapped on someone. John Summit Tapped for LIV Golf Adelaide 2026, Joining Peking Duk & FISHER The video dropped less than a month after Olivia Rodrigo lambasted the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security posted an Instagram video soundtracked by her Guts track “All-American Bitch” showing ICE officers forcibly tackling, detaining and deporting people. In the comments, Rodrigo wrote, “don't ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda.” The video featured a montage of what appeared to be undocumented people voluntarily boarding DHS flights and giving a thumbs-up as they depart. Carpenter, a vocal supporter of Trump's 2024 election rival Vice President Kamala Harris, is the latest artist to object to the president's repeated use of popular music for his political videos without their permission. Swifties also aired their ire at the White House last month over a TikTok video set to Swift's hit Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping single “The Fate of Ophelia,” renamed “The Fate of America,” depicting Trump's mug shot from when he was charged with trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election results as well as an image of POTUS kissing an American flag.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Posted Monday, the 20-second clip opened with footage of people ostensibly protesting against ICE raids, before transitioning to a montage of agents appearing to chase down and detain allegedly undocumented immigrants. The caption quoted Carpenter's lyrics, “Have you ever tried this one? Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.” (As of publication, the video was still up on the White House's X and TikTok accounts. Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement to Rolling Stone, “Here's a Short n' Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: We won't apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country.

The agency similarly used her song “All-American Bitch” in a video also showing ICE agents conducting raids and arrests. Rodrigo responded on Instagram, “Don't ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda,” but the video remains up. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UPDATED, with White House comment: Sabrina Carpenter blasted the White House on Tuesday for using her song Juno in an ICE deportation video. Carpenter wrote on X that the video “is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.” The White House posted the video on Monday, featuring images of ICE officers detaining individuals, set to Carpenter's song as a soundtrack. White House Abigail Jackson said in response, “Here's a Short n' Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: we won't apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country. Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?” In October, Kenny Loggins objected to the use of his song Danger Zone in an AI generated video that depicted Trump dropping feces on No Kings protesters. Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately,” Loggins wrote. His music remains in the video on Trump's Truth Social account. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

The best thing any of these “artists” can do is move out of LA, because their narrow worldview is wildly inconsistent with the mainstream public.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Think of how excited we all were when every season of The Simpsons was added to Disney+ in 2019, making the whole show accessible. Think of how confused we then were when we realized that Disney+ uses a different aspect ratio than Fox did back in the 90s, leaving some sight gags neutered. Yesterday, HBO Max uploaded the entirety of Mad Men, which was exciting and confusing for a different reason: Instead of cropping jokes out of the frame, an error somewhere in the process has revealed far too much. As Bluesky user Paul Haine pointed out this morning, the remastered Mad Men has at least once left a props coordinator in the background of a shot. As fellow Bluesky users Cooper Lund and Todd Vaziri point out, it doesn't seem to be an issue of cropping but of post-production; the frame seems pretty identical to the original, which is still in the 16:9 aspect ratio but doesn't include the vomit hose guy. When HBO announced the news that Mad Men was coming to streaming, a spokesperson shared that the company was thrilled to “provide fans the opportunity to enjoy the series in a fresh way with an enhanced 4K viewing experience.” There's no doubt about that. As of this writing, it's unclear what other surprises may lie in wait for these mad men; those fans embarking on a rewatch probably haven't made it much further than the series seventh episode on its first day of availability.

The past decade of Hollywood horror has been dominated by names like Jordan Peele and Zach Cregger, creators who pivoted from short-form comedy careers to find massive success in genre filmmaking. In 2026, horror fans might be adding another name to that list: Curry Barker. And a new teaser trailer offers a hint at what's in store when it opens in theaters next spring. Related Stories ‘KPop Demon Hunters' Star Ken Jeong on the Magic of Making a ‘Culturally Specific' Masterpiece ‘One Battle After Another' Wins Best Film at 2025 New York Film Critics Circle Awards: Full Winners List Written and directed by Barker, “Obsession” stars Michael Johnston as a romantically unsuccessful young man who asks a vintage wish-granting toy to make his crush (Inde Navarrette) become obsessed with him. Jason Blum also boarded the project as an executive producer through Blumhouse — arguably the biggest endorsement a new horror filmmaker can receive. “'Obsession' begins with the simplest of horror premises,” IndieWire's TIFF review read. “Bear is a shy and sensitive music store employee who can't find the courage to ask his co-worker and childhood friend Nikki on a date. Rather than be honest with her and tell her how he actually feels, he wanders into a woo-woo crystal store and buys a One Wish Willow, a kitschy antique toy from the 1960s that promises to grant its owner one wish when they snap a branch in half. The cashier warns him that most of the customers who buy them have complained about the results, but it wouldn't be much of a horror movie if he listened.”A Focus Features release, “Obsession” opens in theaters on May 15, 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The finale releases globally on both Netflix and in participating theaters Dec. 31 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. Empire Hangs in the Balance As Second Round Bids Arrive It Might Be Easier to List Who Netflix Is Not Partnering With on 'Stranger Things 5' Merch Exhibitors are selling a concession voucher for fans to reserve seats via an RSVP list, meaning Netflix won't earn revenue on the fan screenings. “We're beyond excited that fans will have the chance to experience the final episode of Stranger Things in theaters — it's something we've dreamed about for years, and we're so grateful to Ted [Sarandos], Bela [Bajaria] and everyone at Netflix for making it happen,” the Duffer brothers said at the time in a statement. Then after we were done filming, Netflix approached us with the idea of putting the finale on its own day, which we thought was cool because it would allow us to pitch our movie theater idea. So we pitched them and the reason we've never pitched it before [is] because it just never really made sense given how the show is released. What's fun about seeing something in the theater, we think, is that everyone is experiencing it for the first time together. What we liked about this particular release pattern is that it allows that opportunity for a group of fans to sit and watch this unfold together.” “Otherwise you're just going off TikTok and YouTube videos or whatever,” he said. The Duffer Brothers recently signed a four-year exclusive deal with Paramount to create feature films after their Netflix contract ends next year. The move also follows Netflix's success in releasing KPop Demon Hunters as a sing-along theatrical event this summer. Since Stranger Things debuted in 2016, the series has become one of Netflix's most popular television series ever, with its fourth season alone amassing over 140.7M views globally. The sprawling cast includes Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo,  Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, Maya Hawke, Priah Ferguson, Brett Gelman, Jamie Campbell Bower, Cara Buono, Amybeth McNulty, Nell Fisher, Jake Connelly, Alex Breaux and Linda Hamilton. Created by the Duffer brothers, Stranger Things is produced by Upside Down Pictures & 21 Laps Entertainment with the Duffer brothers as executive producers, along with Shawn Levy of 21 Laps Entertainment and Dan Cohen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Her glam team (including hair by Sam Elliot) took her to the next level with a bleached bouffant-style ‘do and bleached eyebrows to match, rendering the soap star nearly unrecognizable. The ensemble was crafted using gingham plaid in a black-and-white pattern. “It is couture, but it's couture made to me … for me, by him,” she added as she gestured towards Raynor. “For me, someone who is in LA … to come to the British Fashion Awards is so iconic,” she said. “It's like … better than the Met Gala,” she quietly added. I think it's chicer than the Met Gala. Which is exactly what Rinna's retro-inspired hairstyle contributed to the vibe. “It's in this amazing check that's kind of like your granddad's shirt, but taken and elevated,” he continued, adding, “It's really an exploration of that, but fused with the women's textiles of Maximilian Raynor.” Though this might go down as one of the star's most dramatic red carpet looks, it isn't the first time that she changed her signature brunette bob to fit the moment. Rinna attended the Viktor & Rolf Haute Couture fall 2025 show in Paris last summer, where she stepped out in a trench coat with a similarly oversized shoulder, bleached (and slightly purple) hair in a bouffant-style updo.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The offers were due Monday, and all three companies submitted their revised plans. Netflix, for example, is now a mostly cash bid, after initially leaning on its stock as a key part of the deal. 'Run Away': Harlan Coben and Stars Ruth Jones, James Nesbitt Preview Netflix Series Diddy Slams 50 Cent's Netflix Documentary as Rapper Keeps Quiet on Rival's Pre-Arrest Footage And Paramount is offering all-cash, having secured debt financing from the private equity giant Apollo, as well as unknown Middle East sovereign wealth funds. The nature of the debt financing means that Ellison and Redbird will retain total control of Paramount if they are successful in their bid. Barring any surprise late bidders or a call by the WBD board to continue with their split, one of the three media giants is likely to emerge as the buyer of assets that include the venerable Warner Bros. film and TV studios, HBO and HBO Max, and IP that includes DC Comics, Friends, and Harry Potter. WBD's board will need to weigh the new offers, and either request a third round of bids if they feel they can extract more compelling offers, or pick a winner and start working on a binding agreement. Paramount wants the whole thing, while Comcast and Netflix want to stay away from linear. Does the company sell itself whole (likely to Paramount) or split itself, either in a sale or a continuation of its previous process? Regulatory hell: The Trump administration has made it clear that David Ellison and his father Larry Ellison would have an easier regulatory path, fresh off their deal for Paramount. At the same time, anonymous administration sources have made it clear to friendly voices like Fox Business Network and the New York Post's Charlie Gasparino that Netflix and Comcast would face scrutiny. And will it dissuade the WBD board from cutting a deal with anyone that doesn't have the last name Ellison? But if the WBD studios are sold, what happens to its film studio, which has had a breakout year under the leadership of Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy? Would NBCU or Paramount really just double their film output? Or is the future of WB more like 20th Century Fox, as a niche with a few releases under the larger umbrella? Sports superpower: WBD may have lost its NBA rights, but its portfolio still includes prime MLB and NHL deals, one half of the March Madness college basketball tourney (Paramount has the rest) and other rights that include the French Open and college football. When added to the portfolios of Paramount or NBCU, it could make for a compelling sports proposition, a sports media giant that would rival only ESPN in scale. He hosts star-studded dinners at his Beverly Hills mansion (once known as Woodland, the estate of mogul Robert Evans), he has sought out meetings and held court at his U.S. Open suite with A-listers and tycoons. Paramount has reportedly offered him a major role, so it stands to reason that others may make similar offers as further enticement for a deal. Mystery bidder: We know that Paramount, Comcast and Netflix have submitted bids, but that doesn't preclude a surprise bidder entering the fray. Perhaps, say, a private equity firm backed by Middle Eastern money? Or a Japanese entertainment conglomerate with an American partner? Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sean Combs sent Aubrey O'Day a string of sexually explicit emails and images of his penis while they were filming Making the Band, the singer alleges in a new Netflix documentary about the Bad Boy founder. “I don't want to just fuck you, I want to turn you out,” O'Day reads aloud in Sean Combs: The Reckoning, which premiered today. If you change your mind and get ready to do what I say, hit me.” God is the Greatest.” O'Day said she continually rebuffed Combs' sexual advances and was eventually kicked out of Danity Kane. O'Day has long been vocal about her negative experience at Bad Boy, and the MTV reality show often highlighted Combs singling out O'Day over her appearance, what he believed was a bad attitude, and calling her “overly raunchy, promiscuous.” However, this is the first time the Danity Kane member has gone into detail about the alleged sexual harassment she faced off-camera. It was only within the past two years, O'Day said, that she learned of an affidavit from a woman who claimed she had seen an incapacitated O'Day being sexually assaulted by Combs and another man in 2005. It features interviews with former Bad Boy artist Mark Curry, Diddy-Dirty Money member Kalenna Harper, former staffer Capricorn Clark, Bad Boy co-founder Kirk Burrowes, and others. Directed by Alexandria Stapleton and executive-produced by rapper Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, the project also obtained footage of a stressed Combs days before he was arrested on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. Combs' team have accused the streamer of using “stolen” material that was never authorized for release and labeled the documentary as a “shameful hit piece.” (Rolling Stone has reached out for comment on O'Day's accusations.) Six days before Combs was arrested on federal criminal charges, footage he intended to use in his own documentary shows him strategizing with his sons, lawyers, then-chief of staff, and entourage on how to fight his quickly tarnishing reputation. The brief window into Combs' inner sanctum reveals him to be a master strategist, constantly thinking of how to control the narrative around him. “He's creating a narrative, always,” explained Capricorn Clark, one of Combs' longtime and high-ranking Bad Boy employees. Priscilla Presley Wins Round in Financial Elder Abuse War, Can Keep Longtime Lawyer Sean Combs Claims Netflix ‘Stole' Never-Before-Seen Footage Leading Up to His Arrest Megan Thee Stallion Wins at Trial Over Deepfake Porn Video and Harassment Sean Combs Seeks Help Days Before Arrest in New Doc Teaser: ‘We're Losing!' When discussing how current media coverage could prove damaging at trial, Combs ordered his team to find “somebody that has dealt in the dirtiest of dirtiest, dirty business of media and propaganda” to target potential jurors. He reasoned that some people might not watch CNN and that his team should look to social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram to reach his intended audience. Spotting police officers on a nearby roof, Combs instructed his videographer to get “cutaway shots” of the uniformed officials. He organized a jaunt up to Harlem, smiling as he took pictures with fans and happily downing shots at a local bar. When he jumped back into his waiting SUV, Combs' mask dropped. “I began to see him use the culture only when he needed it,” said Combs' former head of security Roger Bonds. Combs was seen raging in real time when he learned of former Danity Kane and Diddy-Dirty Money artist Dawn Richard's lawsuit against him, declaring that the “gloves are off.” He directed people in his camp, including his adult son Justin, to circulate old clips of Richard praising him in interviews. He also called in a favor from Kalenna Harper, who was in the group Diddy-Dirty Money, begging her to release a statement disputing Richard's claims. During pretrial hearings, Southern District of New York prosecutors pointed to Combs' repeated calls and texts to Harper as a form of witness tampering. For the first time, a man and woman who served as jurors at Combs' eight-week criminal trial over the summer explained why they acquitted Combs of sex trafficking his former girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura. Although both jurors conceded Combs was extremely violent toward the “Me & U” singer, one woman, identified only as Juror 160, reasoned that Combs wasn't charged with domestic violence. The man, identified as Juror 75, said he couldn't understand why Ventura repeatedly went back to Combs. Using language similar to what Combs' attorney Marc Agnifilo used in his closing arguments as he beseeched the jury to find Combs innocent, the man said he believed the couple were deeply in love but locked in a toxic relationship. After Ventura filed her bombshell sexual abuse lawsuit against Combs in November 2023, Joi Dickerson-Neal had two distinct feelings. Speaking for the first time, Dickerson-Neal did not rehash her date with Combs in 1991, which allegedly ended in her being drugged and sexually assaulted. However, she produced a note that her mother had penned to Combs' mother, Janice, detailing how Dickerson-Neal woke up screaming from a nightmare she had about “Puffy.” “I'm writing to inform you of something that your son did to my daughter that has greatly decreased the quality of her life and wreaked havoc on our entire family,” Dickerson-Neal read aloud from the letter, dated Nov. 26, 1992. “I realize that this may be hard for you to believe, but if I hadn't heard this story from my daughter's own mouth and looked into her eyes, I would have scarcely believed that any individual would compromise another person's dignity in this manner. “She said that he, without her knowledge, videotaped my daughter having sexual intercourse with him,” her mother wrote, adding that Dickerson-Neal suspected Combs showed the tape to “at least 60 or more” people. “Apparently, your son shows these tapes to all of his friends at parties on large screen televisions,” she wrote. “From what I understand, he has done this to several other girls.” Dickerson-Neal said she once bumped into Combs and confronted him about the alleged assault, but he dropped to his knees and denied everything. “When I think back in terms of his rise, it is the most helpless feeling,” Dickerson-Neal added, saying she once threw up when she saw an image of Combs in Times Square with his fist raised high in the air. Over eight years, former male escort Clayton Howard claimed to have been hired by Combs and Ventura for freak-offs every few weeks, flying across the country to engage in dayslong sex sessions. Howard said Combs was very particular, giving Ventura instructions and feedback about how she should be positioned, either granting or denying her permission on when she could move onto the next stage of the sexual encounter. He claimed to have witnessed numerous instances where Combs beat Ventura during the middle of a freak-off. There was clear drug use during the freak-offs, Howard added. “I don't think I ever encountered Puff at a time where he wasn't high out of his face,” he recalled. He told me there was a little G in the baby oil.” (Both Combs and Ventura previously denied that there were drugs in the baby oil.) Howard said “the weirdest thing” that occurred during the freak-offs was that “they used to physically collect my semen in a cup.” It was “creepy” to Howard, who finally asked what they were doing with it. “I would hang out, drink, and party with them for three or four days while I had sex with Casandra,” he said. Evanescence to Embark on 2026 World Tour: ‘It Feels Like Everything at the Right Time' Sean Ono Lennon Breaks Down His Oscar-Winning Short Film: ‘I Want to Make People Cry' It also raises a new accusation from Bad Boy co-founder Kirk Burrowes, who claims Combs once became physical with his mother, Janice. It was shortly after the City College of New York tragedy in December 1991, where nine people died in a stampede at a charity celebrity basketball event Combs organized. At the time, Combs was still a rising star at Uptown Records, and he was placed on administrative leave as officials investigated the incident. Depressed and holed up in a hotel, Burrowes said Janice asked Combs whether he was sure he wanted to continue in the music business and whether it was a wise choice for him.</p>

She was seen singing the beginning lyrics to her song “Long Live” — the final track of her 2010 album, “Speak Now” — while playing the piano in a sparkly purple gown.

Other notable faces featured in the project include Sabrina Carpenter, who opened for several of Swift's shows, as well as her collaborators Gracie Abrams and Ed Sheeran. Swift was also busy writing two new albums during the record-breaking world tour, releasing “The Tortured Poets Department” in April 2024 and “The Life of a Showgirl” in October 2025. The pop star also re-recorded her “Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and” and “1989 (Taylor's Version)” while touring the globe.</p>

The full list of Billboard's 2025 year-end charts are almost here, and we're counting down the days to their unveiling on Tuesday, Dec. 9, with a special look at select rankings in the lead-up to the big reveal — and today (Dec. 2)., we have the top 10s of three of the year-end R&B/hip-hop charts. On Dec. 9, hundreds of year-end charts will be posted on Billboard's website, following the conclusion of the Billboard 2025 No. 1s Livestream, hosted by Druski, which will broadcast on the Billboard News YouTube channel and BillboardTV on Samsung TV Plus starting at noon ET/9 a.m. PT, as special surprise guests stop by to celebrate the year in chart-toppers. Today, we're dropping the top 10s of the 2025 Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and Hot R&B Songs charts. Kendrick Lamar and SZA‘s “Luther” leads the year-end Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs roundup, following its unstoppable run on the weekly version of the chart. It debuted on the chart dated Dec. 7, 2024, climbed to No. 1 just two weeks later, and was on the chart during the rest of the 2025 chart year (Oct. 26, 2024, through Oct. 18, 2025), never falling below No. SZA, meanwhile, crowns the year-end Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums recap, with a project that debuted on the weekly chart on Dec. 24, 2022 — SOS. It's the second time the title has finished atop the year-end Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, as it also reigned in 2023. (It was the No. The album's chart performance in 2025 was enhanced by its expanded reissue with additional songs in December 2024, dubbed SOS Deluxe: LANA. All versions of the album, old and new, are combined together with the original album for tracking and charting. During the 2025 chart year, SOS never left the chart, spent 15 weeks at No. 1, and never ranked below No. The Weeknd and Playboi Carti‘s “Timeless” tops the year-end Hot R&B Songs chart. The track premiered at No. 1 on the Oct. 12, 2024-dated Hot R&B Songs chart, and remained on the list through the July 19, 2025, chart. During that span, it spent 20 weeks atop the ranking, never going lower than No. “Timeless” marked the 12th No. 1 for The Weeknd and the first for Playboi Carti. For the top 10 of the three lists, scroll below. The full depth of the three rankings (beyond the top 10s of each) will be posted Dec. 9 alongside the complete menu of Billboard‘s 2025 year-end charts. Billboard's year-end music charts represent aggregated metrics for each artist, title, label and music contributor on the weekly charts from Oct. 26, 2024, through Oct. 18, 2025. Rankings for Luminate-based recaps reflect equivalent album units, airplay, sales or streaming during the weeks that the entries appeared on a respective chart during the tracking year. Any activity registered before or after a title's chart run isn't considered in these rankings. That methodology detail, and the October-October time period, account for some of the difference between these lists and the calendar-year recaps that are independently compiled by Luminate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With family dinners now firmly out of fashion thanks to TikTok, there's only one thing left that can bring families together: Sequels to box office smash hits about misunderstood villains. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, Zootopia 2 had a massive Thanksgiving weekend for Disney, which has been clinging to its emotional support Lilo & Stitch remake all year as Snow White, Elio, and Tron: Ares crashed out over a cruel 2025. But now that Disney has released its final Jared Leto-led film of the year, it can relish Zooptopia 2‘s $98 million opening weekend and its collective domestic five-day take of $158 million, per The Numbers. Movie theaters cleaned up this weekend, and it's essentially thanks to having two movies in wide release that appeal to families. In total, Wicked: For Good has grossed $390 million worldwide, an incredible figure made modest by Zootopia 2. No wonder studios put all their money in tentpoles. Neither has made $100 million domestic, but overseas, both are doing quite well—unless, of course, the studios expected Zootopia money, in which case they're bombs. We imagine the movie will find its audience on planes and Paramount+. While much of the top 10 remains stagnant, there were some interesting additions. Netflix rarely reports its box office grosses, but it claims the latest Knives Out mystery, Wake Up Dead Man, took in $1.5 million in 600 theaters. That's a considerable drop-off from the $9.2 million that Glass Onion made in its opening weekend in November 2022 during the film's brief theatrical release. While it might be easy to say people are waiting to watch this one on Netflix, there was stiffer competition in 2025 than three years ago. A24's afterlife rom-com, Eternity, and Chloé Zhao's “emotional wrecking ball,” Hamnet, served as counterprogramming for the childless. Without the additional child-priced ticket sales, Eternity returned $3.1 million in its opening weekend. Meanwhile, Hamnet, still in limited release, made just shy of $1 million. People need to find out how Shakespeare came up with the idea for Hamlet, and the answer is a one-way ticket to a depressing holiday classic.
