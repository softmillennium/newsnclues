                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stocks advanced Tuesday, a day after the three major equities indexes ended their runs of five consecutive winning sessions. Bitcoin was trading around $92,000, up sharply from its overnight low of below $85,500. Yesterday, the largest cryptocurrency suffered its worst day since March, tumbling from around $91,000 and weighing on crypto-tied stocks Strategy (MSTR), MARA Holdings (MARA), Coinbase Global (COIN), and Robinhood Markets (HOOD). Nvidia (NVDA) shares, which advanced 1.7% Monday after it announced an expanded partnership with and $2 billion investment in Synopsys (SNPS), rose 1% further Tuesday. Most of the other Magnificent Seven large-cap technology firms also were slightly higher. Boeing (BA) shares soared 9% to lead the S&P 500 and Dow after CFO Jay Malave said at a conference that the plane maker expects 737 and 787 deliveries will increase in 2026. Shares of MongoDB (MDB) and Credo Technology Group Holding (CRDO) surged 23% and 16%, respectively, after each posted quarterly results that easily topped analysts' estimates. CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) were up about 2% ahead of their respective quarterly results after the closing bell. Elsewhere, Costco Wholesale (COST) stock little changed after the retailer sued the Trump administration over its tariffs; shares of Moderna (MRNA) and Shopify (SHOP) were down less than 1% and up roughly 6% after they led S&P 500 and Nasdaq decliners, respectively, on Monday; and Bayer closed up nearly 12% in Frankfurt trading after U.S. Amazon (AMZN) is rolling out "ultra-fast" deliveries in Seattle and Philadelphia. The news is affecting shares of Instacart parent Maplebear (CART). Shares of Maplebear were down 4% in recent trading after Amazon announced in a blog post that it's "now testing an ultra-fast delivery offering of the items customers want and need most urgently in parts of Seattle and Philadelphia. Amazon Now brings thousands of household essential items and groceries to customers' doorsteps in about 30 minutes or less." The e-commerce giant added that Amazon Prime members will receive "discounted delivery fees starting at just $3.99 per order (vs. $13.99 for non-Prime customers)," and that a "small basket fee of $1.99 will apply to orders below $15." Mark Your Calendar: Some People Will Receive Two Social Security Payments in December The Social Security Administration distributes benefits to almost 74 million people each month. However, for those who began receiving retirement, spousal, or survivor benefits before May 1997, they typically receive their payments on the 3rd of every month. Supplemental Security Income, a program that provides additional income for people with disabilities and adults aged 65 and older with limited or no income, is distributed separately from Social Security benefits at the beginning of every month. Despite today's declines, shares of Signet are up about 14% this year. Boeing (BA) shares surged 8%, the leading gainers on the S&P 500 after the plane maker's new CFO said at a conference held by UBS that its plan to ramp up production after safety issues substantially slowed production last year are going according to schedule, and said Boeing expects to generate positive free cash flow next year after burning through billions in the last two years. The stock is also extending a rally that was sparked Friday by reports that Apple (AAPL) could be the company's next big customer. Warehouse retail giant Costco Wholesale (COST) has joined the list of companies looking for a refund on tariffs. Costco did not specify in the filing how much it has paid in tariffs, but executives have said in earnings calls that the company was working with its suppliers to minimize the impact and that it would work to keep prices as low as it could. Boeing Stock Powers S&P 500, Dow Higher After CFO Comments on Deliveries, Cash Flow Comments by Boeing (BA) CFO Jay Malave at a conference Tuesday morning are lifting the company's shares and major indexes. Boeing stock soared 8% to lead the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average after Malave said at the UBS Global Industrials and Transportation Conference that "we expect absolutely deliveries to be up (in 2026) in both cases, both 737 and both 787." Including Tuesday's sharp gains, Boeing shares have risen about 14% this year, slightly better than the Dow's advance but slightly worse than the S&P 500's. Here's Why the Maker of Roundup Weedkiller's Stock Is Surging Today Shares of pharmaceutical conglomerate Bayer are surging 13% on their home exchange in Germany after the U.S. Solicitor General supported its efforts to have the Supreme Court review prior rulings on whether Roundup weedkiller, produced by Bayer-owned Monsanto, needs a cancer risk warning label. The solicitor general said in a Monday filing that the Environmental Protection Agency has for years said that glyphosate, a chemical used in Roundup, is "not likely to be carcinogenic in humans," and said the Food and Drug Administration has approved "hundreds of labels for Roundup" that did not include any information about cancer. Bayer has argued that since federal agencies have determined the chemical doesn't require a cancer warning, customers should not be able to sue for violating state laws regarding a failure to warn customers about cancer risks. It said a ruling from the Supreme Court on whether companies can be sued for violating state laws when complying with a federal agency's determination of a chemical's safety would provide clarity for the company and customers. Monsanto was acquired by Bayer in 2018 for $63 billion, and a California jury held Monsanto liable just months after the deal was closed for failing to warn about Roundup's potential cancer risks after a groundskeeper was diagnosed with cancer. How You Should Tackle 'Travel Tuesday': Expert Views on the Promotion You may still be settling in from a Thanksgiving trip, but experts say it's smart to start planning your next getaway. Nearly all major airlines and several hotels will offer bargain rates tomorrow in what's become known as "Travel Tuesday". Travel companies now extend more deals on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving than on Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined, according to Hopper, a travel booking app. The industrywide promotion grew out of an annual deal Hopper launched in 2017, and has become a bonafide opportunity for bargain-hunting, said Clint Henderson, managing editor of The Points Guy, a travel site. "It's probably the best time of the year to book cheap flights," said Henderson, later explaining that he initially saw Travel Tuesday as a marketing move. For instance, Delta Air Lines (DAL) is selling roundtrip tickets from New York City to the Dominican Republic, Cayman Islands and St. Thomas for less than $300. But domestic airfare may be particularly inexpensive—Alaska Air Group (ALK) is promoting regional one-way tickets for as low as $29, and trips from California to Hawaii for $99, according to its website. Shareholders of Credo Technology Group Holding (CRDO) stock evidently were quite pleased with the company's results and current-quarter projections. Credo stock surged 17% before the bell Tuesday, a day after the high-speed connectivity solutions firm reported fiscal 2026 second-quarter results and issued third-quarter guidance well above analysts' expectations. San Jose, Calif.-based Credo posted Q2 adjusted earnings of $0.67 per share on revenue that skyrocketed 272% year-over-year to $268.0 million. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected $0.49 and $234.8 million, respectively. Shares of Credo—which says it provides "reliable, energy-efficient, system-level connectivity solutions for the next generation of AI-driven applications, cloud computing and hyperscale networks"—entered Tuesday having more than doubled year-to-date. Shares of MongoDB soared 23% in premarket trading Tuesday, a day after the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share on revenue that increased 19% year-over-year to $628.3 million. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha had expected $0.82 and $594.3 million, respectively. For the current quarter, the New York-based company sees adjusted EPS of $1.44 to $1.48 on revenue of $665 million to $670 million, both well above consensus estimates. "Existing customers are expanding with us and net-new customer additions continue to show strength. Companies across industries and geographies are choosing MongoDB because we provide a unified data platform that powers mission-critical workloads today and also positions them to capitalize on the emerging AI platform shift." Entering Tuesday, MongoDB shares have risen more than 40% this year. Stock Futures Point Higher After Major Indexes Snap Five-Session Winning Streaks Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average pointed 0.2% higher.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Implied volatility is influenced by demand for options or hedging instruments. "When the BVIV-VIX spread widens, it typically signals that markets expect higher volatility in crypto than in equities," Volmex's Founder Cole Kennelly told CoinDesk. Prospects of BTC volatility becoming relatively richer compared to the S&P 500 may draw pair traders to consider opposing volatility bets in BTC and the S&P 500. "When the BVIV–VIX spread widens meaningfully, some traders view it as a relative value setup: crypto implied volatility has cheapened or richened relative to equity volatility. This type of view is typically expressed through multi-legged cross-asset volatility trades rather than a simple directional position," Kennelly explained. It goes without saying that these strategies are risky, like other plays, and require constant monitoring of positions and ample capital, which makes them suitable for institutions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global FinTech company Unlimit launched a non-custodial stablecoin clearing house designed to simplify blockchain transactions for businesses and individuals. The Stable.com platform integrates non-custodial exchange with Unlimit's global payments infrastructure so that users can swap and off-ramp across all major stablecoins, the company said in a Tuesday (Dec. 2) press release. The platform enables gasless, zero-commission conversions across all leading stablecoins; provides native off-ramp of stablecoins into local currencies worldwide; and allows users to retain full control of their funds, according to the release. “Today, we empower the crypto industry to evolve, advance and unlock its full potential.” While stablecoins have become fundamental instruments in global trade, remittances and decentralized finance, each transaction involves a complex network of operational, technical and security frameworks, PYMNTS reported in May. “You need to make payments so simple that even a grandmother will use it one day, maybe without even knowing that the mechanism behind the scenes is a stablecoin … to do that, you need to do a lot of heavy lifting.” Following the passage of new U.S. cryptocurrency legislation, the GENIUS Act, stablecoin payment volume ballooned to more than $10 billion in August, according to blockchain data provider Artemis Analytics. Artemis Analytics said stablecoin payments could reach $122 billion over a full year. “It's well understood that stablecoins have graduated from merely being a tool used by crypto traders and exchanges to conveniently move money around without relying on banks, to a more widely used tool for consumer and enterprise payments,” the company said. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although BTC products saw $464M in inflows, combined altcoin flows amounted to over $600M. In general, the market is moving further toward altcoins as Bitcoin struggles to maintain a solid price. In addition to tried-and-true coins, DeepSnitch AI, an early-stage presale, saw increased levels of activity as traders sought out high-upside opportunities. Raising $650K in record timing, combined with the strength of the underlying AI prediction and analytics suite, got many anticipating 100x gains and aping into DeepSnitch AI as one of the best altcoins to buy in Q4. Although generally bullish, BTC and Ethereum products are still in the red on a monthly basis, which is a stark contrast to XRP with $790M. The likely reason for the resurgence was restored market sentiment following Bitcoin's push above $90K and optimism over potential Fed interest cuts later in December. Unfortunately for traders, the trend didn't stick, and Bitcoin dropped below $86K on December 1. As predicting Bitcoin's short-term trajectory gets more challenging, many retail traders are looking for the best altcoins to buy in Q4 in anticipation of a Santa rally and a more confident rally in December. Although altcoins still haven't had their opportunity to shine, new presales, including DeepSnitch AI, have proved their resilience against wider market currents. Case in point: DeepSnitch AI raised nearly $650K while the market was going through a downturn. As a presale that prioritizes efficiency in development, DeepSnitch AI's prediction and analytics suite, running on five AI agents, is nearly complete. The two core agents are already running in an analytics layer, allowing them to track whale wallets, predict FUD storms, anticipate sentiment shifts, and scan tokens for rug pull risks. While these functions will be available to early investors shortly, many traders are also aping the project for its upside potential. Since DeepSnitch AI has mass appeal, traders expect widespread adoption, which could help the project reach a similar level of success as FET or RENDER. If the 100x projection comes true, DeepSnitch AI could yield $50K gains on a small investment of $500. DeepSnitch AI is expected to launch in January, and while no official confirmation has been made, the community anticipates a MEXC or a Bybit listing. According to CoinMarketCap, PI traded in the $0.2200 area on December 1, showing a noticeable downturn. In this case, PI could push past $0.2600, followed by a massive surge toward $0.4800. DOGE traded in the $0.13 area on December 1, according to CoinMarketCap. To restore DOGE's prospects, the coin must regain its 20-day EMA of $0.15, which will signal a comeback and allow the close above $0.17. If this move goes by smoothly, DOGE could eventually surge toward $0.29. Because it raised $650K and many traders are betting on its 100x narrative, the underlying prediction and analytics solution only serves to strengthen DeepSnitch AI's long-term prospects – after all, can so many traders be wrong? Most importantly, the solution is already operational and will be made available to investors soon.

The former hedge fund boss also called Tesla "ridiculously overvalued" and has issued regular warnings about the AI bubble on X and his newly-launched Substack. It's not the first time Burry, who was played by Christian Bale in a 2015 movie adaptation of Lewis' book, has been critical of crypto. In 2021, Burry warned that although he believed the reasons for bitcoin's existence were "relevant," the cryptocurrency was a "speculative bubble" that posed more risk than opportunity. "If you do not know how much leverage is involved in the run-up, you may not know enough to own it," he wrote in a since-deleted tweet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He cannot be both SAPM and chairman of the regulatory authority Bilal Bin Saqib, Pakistan's Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain, has resigned from his post as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Blockchain and Crypto in order to comply with bureaucratic regulations, The Express Tribune has learnt. Saqib had to resign because the Rules of Business 1973 say that you cannot be an SAPM if you are the chairman of a statutory regulatory authority such as the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. Saqib was appointed Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Blockchain and Crypto with the status of Minister of State in May 2025. He has been leading Pakistan's national blockchain strategy and helped with the establishment of the regulatory authority of which he is currently chairman. Pakistan is home to over 50 million crypto users, with an annual trading volume exceeding $300 billion. Pakistan boasts a highly favorable demographic for widespread crypto adoption, making it one of the most promising emerging markets for blockchain and digital finance innovation. A London-based entrepreneur, Bilal Bin Saqib has been at the forefront of digital innovation and social impact. Recognized by King Charles III, the late Queen Elizabeth II, and the Mayor of London, Saqib's work spans across blockchain technology, crypto investments, and social entrepreneurship. His academic credentials include a Master's in Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship from the London School of Economics (LSE). He also received the 1632nd Points of Light Award, a recognition granted by the British Prime Minister to individuals making outstanding contributions to their communities. Beyond his work in fintech, Saqib co-founded Tayaba, a social enterprise focused on Pakistan's water crisis, introducing the H2O Wheel, an innovative water transportation device designed to ease the burden on rural communities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The term Digital Asset Treasury companies, known as DATs or DATCOs, has emerged as one of the biggest buzzwords in the digital currency industry this year, providing investors with a novel way to play crypto — but with new risks. A DAT is effectively a publicly-listed entity that holds cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ether and provides investors with exposure to the underlying digital currency. But with crypto markets seeing a big plunge in recent weeks, the strategies of DATs has come under scrutiny and raised concerns about whether they could add further pressure to an already weak crypto market. A Digital Asset Treasury is a type of company that buys and holds cryptocurrencies directly on its balance sheet. The original — and one of the biggest DATs — is Michael Saylor's Strategy which began buying bitcoin in 2020 and has done so ever since. That number has since jumped to 190 companies, while another 10 to 20 firms are focused on alternative digital assets as of September, DLA Piper said. These DATs hold around $100 billion worth of cryptocurrencies combined, according to data from The Block. But their growth has also come at a time when it's easier than ever to buy cryptocurrencies directly or invest in the asset via other regulated entities like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). DATs are intended to outperform the underlying assets which they hold. They can achieve this through various strategies to maximise returns. They "package crypto assets within SEC-regulated securities," the investment bank's analysts said. "This eliminates regulatory ambiguity and ensures the same public reporting, disclosures, and investor protections as any public equity." Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told CNBC that DATs also offer an option to "institutional and professional investors with regulatory, fiduciary or operational constraints that make direct token ownership or crypto ETFs unsuitable." DATs offer unique capabilities that ETFs cannot, employing a range of strategies to enhance investor returns. To assess the performance of these DATs, a metric known as market net asset value, or mNAV, is closely watched. DATs can use an at-the-market (ATM) equity program to increase their crypto holdings. When its share price exceeds the net asset value of the crypto holdings, a DAT can issue more shares at a premium and therefore raise cash. "This creates a crypto-per-share accretive feedback loop: the issuer raises equity, accumulates tokens, and sees its NAV per share increase, further increasing the premium, representing accretive dilution," Macquarie explained. To stake, an investor effectively locks up their crypto on a blockchain to help the network run better. However, unstaking crypto can take several weeks, which may limit ETFs and similar products from fully embracing staking, given their need for liquidity and stable asset values. Staking creates free cash flow that "can be redeployed into mergers and acquisitions (M&A), token purchases, on-chain opportunities, or shareholder distributions," ARK Invest said in a note last month. As the market advances, there are likely to be new trading strategies employed by DATs. DATs have come into focus amid recent crypto market turmoil, with bitcoin well off its all-time high. As crypto prices fall, mNAV may fall under 1, meaning companies are trading at a discount to their crypto holdings. "When the crypto market pulls back, DATCOs face pressure and they have a limited menu of realistic responses," Alexander said. "Some may double‑down and hold, viewing the drop as a buying opportunity for future appreciation. Others may need liquidity, especially those that used financing (e.g. debt, convertible bonds, share issuance) which can force them to sell part of their token holdings." And an mNAV premium is key for the DAT market. If this premium erodes or reverses to a discount, the model faces significant challenges," Macquarie analysts said. The investment bank also notes that if a DAT's stock price falls or near NAV, equity issuance becomes dilutive, meaning "new shares issued no longer increase crypto per share, but rather dilute existing shareholders' exposure. "The sector is becoming increasingly crowded, with capital flowing in according to an established playbook. Should any of the key variables - investor sentiment, crypto prices, or capital market liquidity - fall, the DATCO model could unravel," Macquarie said. Strategy has sought to protect itself against the downturn. On Monday, the company announced a $1.44 billion U.S. dollar reserve that was funded by the sale of more stock. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said other DATs may follow Strategy's decision to dilute shareholders. "It is not particularly confidence-inspiring: it highlights both their dependence on, and their expectation of, a recovery in token prices," Butterfill told CNBC. "We do expect token prices to rebound, particularly if the Federal Reserve delivers a December rate cut, which should help these companies avoid forced liquidations. "As token prices drop, even the highest‑profile DATs have begun scaling back. This can amplify volatility in the broader crypto markets, because DATs are large holders: their sales, even if staggered, increase supply into already weakened liquidity conditions," Alexander said. But as their influence potentially grows, they may have more of an impact on braoder markets. "As DATCOs scale, their market influence grows; an unwind could weaken a major tailwind for crypto, namely the normalization of digital assets on corporate balance sheets," Macquarie said. "This, in turn, could dampen public equity interest in digital asset exposure, slow crypto ETF inflows, and pressure cryptocurrency prices." The DAT space is currently in a bubble, according to Sussex University's Alexander. "The DATCO model seems to have attracted many entrants driven more by marketing, hype and easy capital than by durable business fundamentals," she told CNBC. CoinShares' Butterfill said the "bubble has already decisively burst," with many DATs now trading at mNAVs below 1 and a "clear signal that the market fears" these companies will be forced to sell their digital assets. However, both experts said DATs may evolve in the future. "Over the longer term, investors are likely to demand a more measured approach," Butterfill said. Alexander said that these digital asset treasury firms may also begin to diversify their holdings into non-crypto assets too. "I believe those that pivot toward operations such as yield‑generation through staking, increasing the diversification of their tokens, and mix with token traditional assets like cash or T-bills, may survive as legitimate digital‑asset infrastructure players," Alexander said.

These earlier phases already involved substantial engagement with the private sector, for example through an ‘innovation platform' for experimentation with market participants (now in a second round of experimentation); and, more significantly, through the selection of providers for digital euro ‘components and related services' – in a 2 October announcement, the ECB named the companies selected (through a procurement process) as ‘first-ranked' providers for ‘framework agreements' in five activity fields. The agreements, which effectively set the terms for potential future work, have a total estimated spend of €432.1m (about £377m) and a potential maximum spend of €1.164 billion (just over £1 billion).

The pilot will have four main phases: ‘assessment', ‘preparation', ‘implementation' and ‘execution'.

The decision followed positive findings of exploratory work begun in October 2024 to connect TIPS with India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and with Nexus Global Payments – a multilateral payment scheme aiming to super-charge the speed of cross-border transactions. More specifically, the Governing Council has decided to: start a ‘realisation phase' for interlinking TIPS with UPI while completing legal arrangements and technical implementation; and ‘continue exploring the feasibility of a potential connection to Nexus Global Payments while in parallel completing the necessary legal arrangements and agreements'. The decision is ‘part of the Eurosystem's overall efforts to make it easier for businesses and consumers in Europe to send and receive payments to and from other countries, including remittances', the ECB said in an announcement (20 November).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tech stocks linked to Bitcoin staged a modest comeback in overnight trading, although it wasn't enough to wipe away the losses they suffered yesterday. In recent days, it has stabilized at around $87K per coin and was up 0.72% today. It dropped 3.25% yesterday but was up 0.45% before the bell. The key metric for Strategy, however, is its “mNAV” (multiple to net asset value), which is a ratio describing the company's theoretical enterprise value (currently $65.2 billion) to its Bitcoin holdings. The situation was made more tense after Strategy CEO Phong Le said on a podcast that the company would be willing to sell some of its Bitcoin in order to meet the dividend commitments on its debt and preferred shares. “Now, as we are looking at Bitcoin winter, as we see our mNAV compressing, my hope is our mNAV doesn't go below one,” he said. On Monday, the company published an investor presentation which confirmed (on page 11) that it will begin selling Bitcoin if the mNAV falls below one. Strategy currently holds just over 3% of all Bitcoin. (The company did not immediately respond when contacted for comment.) Traders betting on leveraged plays against Strategy have already been wiped out. Two exchange-traded funds, MSTX and MSTU, which offered double the returns of the underlying Strategy stock, have lost more than 80% of their value, according to Bloomberg. Together with a third, MSTP, they have lost $1.5 billion in value over the past month. Strategy shares declined Tuesday after the company said it had created a $1.44 billion “U.S. Some crypto investment experts have a negative outlook. Patrick Horsman, chief investment officer at BNB Plus, another crypto treasury company, told the Wall Street Journal, “I think we could see Bitcoin get all the way back to $60,000 … We don't think the pain is over.” Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune.

The ICO says around 90 percent of children in the UK play games on digital devices and 84 percent of parents are concerned about potential exposure to strangers or harmful content.

To address this, the ICO says it will review the top ten most popular mobile games, assessing their compliance with privacy settings, geolocation controls, and targeted advertising practices. The organization will also review any other privacy issues raised in the process.

“Children's online experiences are shaped not just by social media and video sharing platforms, but also by the games they play. Our early review suggests that many mobile games' design features can be especially intrusive, raising important questions about how these games are designed and experienced, and their adherence to the ICO's Children's code standards,” explains John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner.

“We're expanding our strategy to ensure that mobile games meet the same high standards of data protection we've driven across other platforms.”

The ICO previously announced its Children's Code Strategy, which has seen a number of social networks and video sharing platforms make changes to the way they manage data protection for children. 

The strategy has seen popular platforms introduce changes such as giving children private profiles by default, and restricting the visibility of child users.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Renowned investor and media personality Kevin O'Leary said Monday that altcoins are no longer bouncing back after market corrections, as investor attention is now solely on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH). O'Leary said in an X post that investors have realized owning only the two coins is enough to capture 97.5% of all the cryptocurrency market's “alpha.” “If you own those two, it doesn't matter what happens anywhere else because everything else is moving with a much higher  [volume] to the downside and not recovering anymore because they have no use case,” O'Leary, also known as “Mr Wonderful,” argued. He added that, unlike previous corrections, altcoins in the current market haven't bounced back as expected. Notably, CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index had a value of 23 as of this writing, indicating a “Bitcoin Season.” Altcoin Season typically happens if 75% of the top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin in the last 90 days. See Also: Trump Media Nears Public Launch Of $6 Billion Cronos Treasury Through Crypto.Com Partnership O'Leary's stance on the two blue-chip assets has been clear for some time. He advised his followers to avoid chasing “irrelevant tokens.” He also noted a shift in investment habits among Gen Zs. Price Action: At the time of writing, BTC was exchanging hands at $86,961.70, up 0.94% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.
