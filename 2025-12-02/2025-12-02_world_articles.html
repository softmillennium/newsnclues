Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. “Under Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano, the agency is aiming to push people to interact with Social Security online instead of going to a field office or calling the agency, although Bisignano told lawmakers in June that, even with his focus on technology, the agency is not ‘getting rid of field offices,' despite reports of planned closures,” Nextgov/FCW reported Monday. One anonymous SSA staffer told the outlet that agency leadership wants “fewer people in the front door and they want all work that doesn't require direct customer interactions to be centralized.” “They appear to be quietly killing field offices,” the staffer said. The cut left one SSA worker for every 1,480 beneficiaries, resulting in understaffed field offices and overwhelmed phone operations. In a social media post on Monday, Warren highlighted testimony from seniors who have faced long wait times and other difficulties while seeking assistance from SSA under Bisignano's leadership: Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, told Nextgov/FCW that “between staffing reductions, more restrictive documentation requirements for Americans to get assistance on the phones, and rapid reorganization of offices around the country, it's difficult to see how” SSA's goal of slashing visits to field offices “will lead to anything other than worse service and more challenges at Social Security.” Your donation on #GivingTuesday advances nonprofit, fully independent news in pursuit of social justice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defense secretary has been insisting that an admiral gave the order for the second strike on alleged drug boat back in September Trump administration is ‘selling out' admiral to shield Hegseth over boat strikes, officials say Pete Hegseth told US soldiers in Iraq to ignore legal advice on rules of engagement “We always have the backs of our commanders,” Hegseth said, insisting that “they've done the right things” in making judgement calls in difficult situations. The White House has also been backing this narrative, leading some some officials in Congress and the Pentagon, as well as Democrats, to now fear that Bradley is being made a scapegoat for the potentially illegal order. “If you have a someone's pregnant on your flight and you're as strong as Pete is,” Duffy said, looking and joking with the defense secretary during Trump's cabinet meeting. “We always have the backs of our commanders,” Hegseth said, insisting that “they've done the right things” in making judgement calls in difficult situations. The White House has also been backing this narrative, leading some some officials in Congress and the Pentagon, as well as Democrats, to now fear that Bradley is being made a scapegoat for the potentially illegal order. In his first public outing since the Washington Post reported that he ordered a second strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat that killed two shipwrecked survivors, Pete Hegseth doubled down on strikes on boats in the Caribbean: “We're going there in a couple of weeks,” Trump said. He added that he talked to treasury secretary Scott Bessent about taking over the Fed but Bessent didn't want the job. He said there was no statute of limitation on war crimes and the justice department should conduct an investigation and hold everyone accountable. While Wilson said the department knows what these suspected carters are “carrying, where they're coming from and where they're going,” she declined to provide details about the Pentagon's intelligence efforts. At a briefing today, Department of Defense press secretary Kingsley Wilson said that the “decision to re-strike the narco terrorist vessel was made by Adm Bradley”. She re-affirmed that defense secretary Pete Hegseth stands behind Bradley. “Adm Bradley made the right call, and unlike the previous administration, we have our war fighters back at this department,” Wilson said. While answering questions from reporters today, Mike Johnson said he doesn't know how much of the video recording of the second strike on alleged drug-trafficking boat, which reportedly killed two survivors, should be released. “I'm not sure how much is sensitive with regard to national security,” he said. “He's a highly decorated, highly respected admiral in the Navy, and he made that call, and so, you know, we're going to have to look at that,” Johnson said. A reminder, Trump won the district by 22 points in 2024. He worked in Tennessee State Government, and is a highly capable, competent, calm, common sense conservative,” Johnson said of Van Epps. A recent poll from Emerson College and the Hill had Van Epps leading his Democratic challenger, Aftyn Behn, by just two points. Today, Johnson reiterated that “anything can happen” in a special election. House Republicans are now holding a press conference on Capitol Hill. She notes that the new rules could affect nearly 1.5m pending asylum cases with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Legal experts expect that the broader asylum pause and other policy changes will face challenges in court. Advocates have warned that the administration's policy announcements targeting refugees, asylum seekers and specifically Afghan nationals, after last week's shooting, amount to collective punishment. The Department of Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem, has called for a sweeping and vague “full travel ban” on “every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies”. Following last week's shooting in Washington DC, that killed one member of the West Virginia national guard, and left another critically wounded, the Trump administration paused all asylum decisions. His asylum claim was ultimately approved after Trump returned to office. In a Monday post on X, Noem said that she had spoken with the president, but was not clear about which countries should be included in a travel ban. “Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom,” she wrote. Donald Trump has accused officials in Honduras of “trying to change” the result of the country's presidential election, as the release of vote counts was paused with two rightwing candidates locked in a technical tie. The virtual vote count had been slow and unstable before it was interrupted around midday on Monday. On his social network, Trump accused officials of “trying to change the results” and warned that “if they do, there will be hell to pay!”. Before the vote, Trump had thrown his support behind Nasry “Tito” Asfura – who on Monday was ahead of his rival, Salvador Nasralla, by just 515 votes – saying that US support for the country was conditional on an Asfura victory. He also made the extraordinary pledge to pardon Asfura's ally, the former president Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking in a New York court last year and sentenced to 45 years in prison for allegedly creating “a cocaine superhighway to the United States”. As election officials pleaded for patience on Tuesday, Hernández's wife, Ana García de Hernández, disclosed that the former president had been released from a US prison. Today, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to meet with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. He'll be joined by the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The meeting comes after a US delegation – which included secretary of state Marco Rubio – held “productive” talks with Ukrainian negotiators in Florida over the weekend. My colleague, Jakub Krupa, is covering the latest, including Volodymyr Zelenskyy's trip to Dublin, where the Ukrainian leader is holding a press conference with Ireland's prime minister Micheál Martin. Today, Zelenskyy said “now, more than ever, there is a chance to end this war”. But “some things still need to be worked out,” he said. Per my last post, it's worth noting that Michael Dell, the billionaire founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, and his wife, Susan, will donate $6.25bn dollars to the “Trump accounts” scheme, resulting in $250 deposits for roughly 25 million American children. This contribution is designed to help children 10 or younger, who were born before 2025. It will be available for families who live in zip codes where the median household income is $150,000 or less. “We know that when children have accounts like this, they're much more likely to graduate from high school, from college, buy a home, start a business and less likely to be incarcerated,” Dell told CNBC in an interview. Donald Trump is in Washington today, and due to hold his ninth cabinet meeting, since returning to the White House this year. That's due to start at 11:30am ET, and we'll bring you the latest updates. Then, the president will make an announcement at 2pm ET, which – according to press secretary Karoline Leavitt – will be about the so-called “Trump accounts”. A reminder that these are tax-free investment accounts for children under the age of 18 in the US who have a social security number. The administration has promised a $1,000 seed contribution for those born between 2025 and 2028, whose parents open an account.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US defense secretary posted meme depicting beloved children's character aiming rocket launcher at set of boats Pete Hegseth told US soldiers in Iraq to ignore legal advice on rules of engagement Hegseth's post of the mocked cover of a Franklin the Turtle book titled Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists prompted disbelief and outrage. “For your Christmas wish list,” Hegseth wrote as the caption. Hegseth's post came amid growing outrage over a string of deadly US strikes on boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific, which have killed at least 80 people. Hegseth's post, which seemingly mocks a practice that experts have condemned as illegal, was met with frustration by the publisher of Canadian children's book series over his “unauthorized” depictions of its main character. “Franklin the Turtle is a beloved Canadian icon who has inspired generations of children and stands for kindness, empathy, and inclusivity,” the publisher Kids Can Press wrote in a statement on X. “We strongly condemn any denigrating, violent, or unauthorized use of Franklin's name or image, which directly contradicts these values,” the publishing house added. The Pentagon's law of war manual says that people who are “wounded, sick, or shipwrecked” should be “respected and protected in all circumstances” by US forces- and that “making them the object of attack is strictly prohibited”. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats were “conducted in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ontario's Auditor-General says the province isn't auditing doctors whose billings raise obvious red flags, including 82 doctors who claimed to have worked 24 hours or more in a single day, a diagnostic radiologist who billed for an average of 461 patients a day, and an ophthalmologist who billed $6.7-million in one year, more than twice as much as the next highest biller in the specialty. When the Ontario Ministry of Health does identify inappropriate billings, it often negotiates settlements that allow doctors to repay less than what they overbilled, Ontario Auditor-General Shelley Spence found in her annual report, released Tuesday. “Not recovering overpayments from physicians represents a waste of taxpayer's money,” the report said. “Stronger payment recovery mechanisms would enable the Ministry to use taxpayer funds more effectively and efficiently, including the possibility of directing those recovered funds to providing more patient care.” Ontario has more family doctors, but fewer are working in primary care, study shows Ontario Premier Doug Ford has vowed that every Ontarian will be attached to a primary-care physician or nurse practitioner by 2029. The Auditor-General's report, citing a network of primary-care researchers called INSPIRE-PHC, says that about two million Ontarians didn't have a family doctor as of March, 2024, up from 1.8 million in 2020. Opinion: Allowing doctors to practise in both public and private systems solves what exactly? Of the approximately 178,000 people who registered with Health Care Connect between 2020-2021 and 2024-2025 and who were still waiting to be referred to a physician as of June, more than 108,000 had been waiting for more than a year. The Auditor-General also found that only 7 per cent of family doctors working in a payment model that sees them formally enroll patients were willing to take patients off the Health Care Connect waiting list. In a separate audit, the Auditor-General scrutinized the Ford government's plan to expand medical school seats for future family doctors, including by opening two new medical schools at Toronto Metropolitan and York universities. Ontario to expand funding for primary health-care teams based on initial success As part of the physician billing audit, Ms. Spence and her office also looked at how often doctors inappropriately charge patients fees for services that are supposed to be covered by OHIP. About a third of those were for eye procedures, including cataract surgeries. “We previously raised this issue in our 2021 audit of Outpatient Surgeries, which found no provincial oversight to protect patients against inappropriate charges for OHIP-funded services or physicians that may mislead and charge patients for unnecessary add-ons,” the new report says. The Ontario government has trumpeted its plans to offer more procedures, including cataract surgeries and, eventually, hip and knee surgeries, in private clinics as a way to reduce waiting times.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Dec. 2 that Moscow is prepared for a war with Europe "right now" if European states initiate one, delivering the remarks moments before meeting U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. "If Europe starts a war, we are ready right now," the Russian president said. Putin's comments came as Washington intensifies diplomatic outreach aimed at advancing negotiations to end Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. The Russian president claimed that European governments obstruct U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to reach a settlement and "live under illusions" of imposing a strategic defeat on Russia. The remarks echoed Moscow's broader messaging as Russia expands hybrid pressure on Europe. Help us grow to 25,000 members by the end of 2025. European states have recorded a surge of suspected Russian-linked activities in recent years, including cyberattacks, sabotage attempts, and repeated damage to underwater infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. The incidents intensified in early autumn as unidentified drones and Russian aircraft repeatedly crossed into or approached NATO airspace. Days later, a Russian drone breached Romanian airspace, though Bucharest did not engage. On Sept. 19, three Russian MiG-31 fighters crossed into Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes, prompting Tallinn to activate consultations under NATO's Article 4. Belgium also reported a series of drone incidents near critical infrastructure. Belgian authorities said three drones flew over the Doel Nuclear Power Plant on Nov. 9, while several unidentified drones were spotted near sensitive sites in the days that followed. Putin's latest warning added pressure to European capitals already concerned about Russia's increasing willingness to test air defenses and target infrastructure across the continent. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Witkoff will present Putin with the latest version of the U.S.-Ukraine framework drafted during recent rounds of talks in Geneva and Florida. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Europe "has no peaceful agenda" and "is on the side of war" just before meeting U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained British citizen Ross David Cutmore, who came to Ukraine as a military instructor, on suspicion of working for Russian intelligence, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 2. "Ukraine approaches all diplomatic efforts with utmost seriousness – we are committed to achieving a real peace and guaranteed security," Zelensky said. According to Ukraine's national "Children of War" database, at least 19,546 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and taken to Russia or Russian-controlled areas since February 2022. "All of this is done exclusively for Western audiences and to raise the stakes in diplomacy," said Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation. The latest incident occurred on Nov. 30, when Vilnius International Airport suspended operations after unidentified objects — believed to be balloons — appeared in nearby airspace. A Ukrainian deep-strike unit hit a Russian "storage and launch area" for Shahed-type drones near Cape Chauda, Crimea, overnight on Nov. 28, the Special Operations Forces said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Europe "has no peaceful agenda" and "is on the side of war" just before meeting U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. "Ukraine approaches all diplomatic efforts with utmost seriousness – we are committed to achieving a real peace and guaranteed security," Zelensky said. According to Ukraine's national "Children of War" database, at least 19,546 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and taken to Russia or Russian-controlled areas since February 2022. "All of this is done exclusively for Western audiences and to raise the stakes in diplomacy," said Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation. The latest incident occurred on Nov. 30, when Vilnius International Airport suspended operations after unidentified objects — believed to be balloons — appeared in nearby airspace. A Ukrainian deep-strike unit hit a Russian "storage and launch area" for Shahed-type drones near Cape Chauda, Crimea, overnight on Nov. 28, the Special Operations Forces said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dressed head to toe in army fatigues, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday received the news he had been awaiting for more than a year: Russia had taken over the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk. The Kremlin said Putin was informed of the victory during a visit to a “command post” on Sunday, although both were only publicized late on Monday, on the eve of the Russian leader's meeting with key aides to US President Donald Trump. Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, accompanied by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, was set to meet Putin later on Tuesday – the latest instalment of a diplomatic whirlwind by the US aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. He reiterated his maximalist demands that Ukraine limits the size of its army, gives up some of its territory, and is banned from joining NATO. The proposal Witkoff is bringing to Putin has not been made public, but Ukraine has made it clear it cannot accept any peace plan that would encroach on its sovereignty along the lines of Moscow's demands. Putin's visit to the military post on Sunday, just before his meeting with the Americans, was clearly designed to portray Putin as a strong war-time leader who has the upper hand in Ukraine. His interactions with the military are rare but carefully timed – such as when he traveled to Kursk in March, just days before one of his previous meetings with Witkoff in Moscow. Speaking to his top generals on Sunday, Putin praised them for “liberating” Pokrovsk, which he called by its Soviet-era name of Krasnoarmiisk, which translates as “Red Army City.” Kremlin made a point of the Pokrovsk developments on Monday, publishing a video showing Russian soldiers unfurling a Russian flag in Pokrovsk's city center – even though that particular area has been under Moscow's control for some time. But its seizure would nevertheless represent the biggest win for Moscow since 2023. One Ukrainian commander with a unit fighting in the city said that Russian troops had “nowhere near complete control” of Pokrovsk and that his unit was still holding onto their positions inside the city. CNN cannot publish the soldiers' name due to security restrictions. George Barros, who leads the Russia and Geospatial Intelligence teams at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, said the messaging by Putin is aimed at Ukraine's western allies as much as it is at Ukraine. “If he can successfully convince the world that Russia's battlefield victory is inevitable, then that leads to the question (among Kyiv's allies) ‘Why are we supporting Ukraine? Let's just negotiate now,'” Barros told CNN last month. But while Russia is inching forward along the frontlines in eastern Ukraine, its overall victory is not at all certain, Barros said. The latest ISW assessment of the Russian forces' rate of advance indicates that a Russian military victory in Ukraine is “not inevitable” and that a quick Russian military takeover of the rest of the Donetsk region – which Putin has been threatening – is unlikely. So even though Putin and his military commanders continue to tout Russian advances and peddle the narrative of their inevitable victory, the easiest way for Russia to get what it wants is either by coercing Ukraine into taking a bad deal, or by convincing Kyiv's allies to ease out their support.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOSCOW, December 2. Russia, China, and India have long maintained strong bonds of friendship and strategic partnership. During the plenary session of the Russia Calling! forum, Russian President Vladimir Putin underscored Moscow's ambition to elevate this cooperation to a new, more advanced level - specifically by enhancing its technological dimension. Putin highlighted Russia's commitment to expanding collaboration with interested nations, noting that the majority of these countries - acting rationally and pragmatically - are eager to deepen their partnerships. He pointed out that over the past three years, Russia has notably increased its trade volume with these key allies, particularly China and India, countries with which Russia shares decades of friendship and strategic ties. "I am aware that many representatives of Chinese and Indian delegations are present here today," Putin remarked. "I want to emphasize our goal to take our cooperation with the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India to a qualitatively new level by strengthening its technological component." According to the Russian leader, numerous joint projects in energy, industry, space, agriculture, and many other areas are already aimed at this. "We have established a substantive dialogue with Chinese President Xi Jinping on economic issues, and we will also discuss these topics in detail during my upcoming visit to India with Prime Minister Narendra Modi," Putin stated.</p>

MOSCOW, December 2. /TASS/. At a plenary session, the State Duma ratified an intergovernmental agreement between Russia and India on procedures for dispatching military personnel, as well as military ships and aircraft, to each other's territory. The Russian Cabinet of Ministers submitted the document to the lower house of parliament in November.

"The agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Republic of India on the procedures for dispatching military units, naval ships, and military aircraft of the Russian Federation to the territory of the Republic of India, and military units, naval ships, and military aircraft of the Republic of India to the territory of the Russian Federation, and the organization of their mutual logistical support, signed in Moscow on February 18, 2025, shall be ratified," the document states.

The explanatory note says that the agreement will streamline not only the dispatch of troops and equipment, but also their logistics. The established procedure will be used during joint exercises, training sessions, humanitarian aid, disaster relief efforts after natural and man-made disasters, and in other cases by agreement.

The Cabinet indicated that ratification of the document will simplify the mutual use of the two countries' airspace and the entry of Russian and Indian warships into each other's ports. Furthermore, the agreement will strengthen military cooperation between the two countries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bank of Nova Scotia BNS-T reported higher fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates as activity in capital markets and wealth management surged, offsetting a restructuring charge aimed at cutting costs. That compared with $1.69-billion, or $1.22 per share, in the same quarter last year. Adjusted to exclude certain items, including a restructuring charge and severance provisions, the bank said it earned $1.93 per share. That edged out the $1.84 per share analysts expected, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. “We delivered improving results through the year as we strengthened our balance sheet, improved our loan-to-deposit ratio, and increased return on equity,” Scotiabank chief executive officer Scott Thomson said in a statement. The bank kept its quarterly dividend unchanged at $1.10 per share. In the quarter, Scotiabank set aside $1.1-billion in provisions for credit losses – the funds banks set aside to cover loans that may default – and included $71-million against loans that are still being repaid, based on models that use economic forecasting to predict future losses. But expenses increased 10 per cent to $5.8-billion, which the bank said was driven by higher personnel costs, technology and business development. Profit from Canadian banking was $941-million, up 1 per cent from a year earlier, driven by higher private equity gains, mutual fund distribution fees and insurance income. Profit from the bank's international division was up 6 per cent to $634-million. The global wealth management division generated $447-million of profit, up 18 per cent. And capital markets profit jumped 50 per cent to $519-million on stronger activity in the United States. Study and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world's longest and deepest undersea road tunnel is being built in Norway, intended to cut travel time between major cities and become part of a ferry-free highway along its western coast. Construction started in January 2018 but was halted in late 2019 due to predicted cost overruns that led to the cancellation of existing contracts and a restructuring of the project. Work resumed in late 2021 and the tunnel is now slated for completion in 2033, at a cost of approximately 25 billion Norwegian kroner (about $2.4 billion). By replacing the current ferry connections, Rogfast will reduce travel time between Bergen and Stavanger — respectively the second and fourth largest Norwegian cities by population — by around 40 minutes and make daily commuting much easier, Moen added. The tunnel will consist of two separate tubes, each with two traffic lanes, designed exclusively for road traffic, and will sport a rather unusual design element roughly halfway through: a double roundabout, 260 meters deep, linking out to a connection tunnel leading to the island of Kvitsøy, Norway's smallest municipality. Building a tunnel of that length under the sea poses several technological challenges. Like most modern tunnels, to save time, Rogfast is being built from both ends concurrently, with the goal of having the two construction teams meet in the middle within a margin of error of just 5 centimeters (1.97 inches). Achieving this level of precision requires careful measurements using lasers and other sophisticated equipment. That can then to be checked against the design plans for any inaccuracies. The 5-centimeter (1.9-inch) margin is among the strictest in the world, but can save time, money, waste, and emissions by avoiding mistakes: “If you deviate from this, you create so much more material that needs to be taken out, and then so much more to be filled in again — it's a lot of whole trucks. The goal is to make it ferry-free by building tunnels and bridges, cutting travel time in half. Rogfast is one of the most ambitious and technically demanding components of that plan, and construction hasn't been hurdle-free, according to Moen. Since we are going all the way down to 392 meters (1,286 feet) below sea level, we're focusing on finding the best methods to maintain safe and efficient working conditions for everyone.” The tunnel also requires measures to protect motorists from air pollution. It will employ a longitudinal ventilation system — which typically use jet fans to create airflow — complemented by shaft ventilation extending up to Kvitsøy. “This combination is designed to ensure effective air circulation and safety throughout the tunnel's considerable length,” said Moen. A real-time incident alert will also be implemented to identify events such as breakdowns or congestion, and cameras and radar will monitor vehicles. Although jobs would be eventually lost from ferry closures, Rogfast will strengthen access to other jobs, education, and public services for local communities, Moen said, and have positive effects on the local economy and the seafood industry, as logistics costs will go down and companies will be able to operate across a wider area. “The project also creates substantial employment during construction and lays the groundwork for more sustainable and integrated regional development along Norway's fractured western coastline,” she said. Currently, the title of world's longest tunnel with an undersea section belongs to the Seikan Tunnel in Northern Japan, a railway-only tunnel that has a total length of 53.85 kilometers (33.5 miles), with an undersea section spanning 23.3 kilometers (14.5 miles). Rogfast, however, will be much deeper below sea level than either Seikan or the Channel Tunnel, which bottom out respectively at 240 meters (790 feet), and 115 meters (377 feet).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Politico journalist Ryan Lizza spoils launch of ex-fiancee Olivia Nuzzi's memoir amid frantic anticipation in US media world Olivia Nuzzi was the blonde purveyor of gossipy magazine pieces, a Hunter S Thompson in high heels patrolling the inner sanctum of Trump world. Ryan Lizza, 20 years her senior, was chief Washington correspondent for Politico, the wonkish political news site. Together they were the golden couple of Washington journalism. Last year, their relationship exploded in public fashion when it emerged she had an alleged affair with Robert F Kennedy Jr while she was reporting on his run for the White House. Her book, American Canto, is published on Tuesday with a fresh wave of revelations. She describes how the man who is now Donald Trump's health secretary was taking psychedelic drugs during his run for president, how her brother offered to kill her ex-fiance when he allegedly threatened to share intimate messages with the press, and how she could have saved her job with Vanity Fair magazine if she had written a tell-all account of the affair. Yet it lands as the latest salvo in an extraordinary media break-up. In his first round of recriminations, he alleged that Nuzzi had an affair with Mark Sanford, a former presidential candidate and Republican politician from South Carolina, in 2020. Then he published lines of toe-curling poetry, with apparent allusions to oral sex, that he attributed to Mr Kennedy. The timing of his interventions (four so far) followed what should have been the start of a marketing blitz for Nuzzi's memoir. The New York Times ran a complimentary profile under the headline “Olivia Nuzzi did it all for love,” complete with black and white photographs that cast her as the “modern iteration of a Hitchcock blonde”. At one point her brother even seems to suggest killing Lizza for allegedly offering “a trove of intimate materials” to the press. The alleged affair is believed to have begun in 2023, when the reporter was covering Mr Kennedy's independent run for president. At the time, she acknowledged having an “emotional relationship” with him but insisted it did not affect her coverage of his campaign. Yet in her book, she confirms one of Lizza's revelations, that she helped RFK Jr manage his media image. “By get ahead of the story,” she continues, “I did not mean to suggest that he should appear on camera to introduce the facts through a more entertaining story than his enemies could ever dream of planting in the press to a shocked and horrified-looking Roseanne Barr.” Which is what happened. Nor did she report on his drug use at the time. She writes: “The Politician still did some psychedelics for fun, he said. Nuzzi describes how she even helped him make the decision about who to endorse when he ended his independent run, asking how he would feel standing on stage pledging his support to Republicans or Democrats. Her worst fear at that moment is that “The Politician's” meeting to endorse Mr Trump could coincide with her appointment to interview the then former president, an adept reader of people and their affairs. “He might at least clock enough data to wonder, and when the president wondered, he wondered aloud,” she writes. In the end, their meetings were scheduled a day apart. “In hindsight, I believe she wanted me to find it – Olivia once conceded this, though at other times she denied it – and I believe she wanted the world to find out that she and Bobby loved each other,” he said. Mr Kennedy, who has been married to Cheryl Hines, an actress, for more than a decade, has denied having an affair with Ms Nuzzi. His spokesman has claimed that he “only met Olivia Nuzzi once in his life for an interview she requested, which yielded a hit piece”. Mr Sanford, when previously contacted for comment by The Telegraph, did not respond.</p>
