Planetary scientists have found a wide range of molecules that are crucial for life among a lot of other organic substances present in asteroids, meteors, and even interstellar space. Now, scientists report new insights into asteroid Bennu, which was sampled by the NASA mission OSIRIS-REx. The latest research suggests tentative evidence for a substance we have not encountered before in extraterrestrial material. When it comes to molecules fundamental to life, we usually focus on the nucleotide bases: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil, which are the fundamental units of DNA and RNA. Of those 22, only 14 have been found in stuff from outer space – until now, possibly. They also report tentative detections of tryptophan, a pretty important amino acid. A form of vitamin B3 has previously been detected in the Bennu sample, which gives credence to this new detection. Tryptophan is pretty fragile, so it is not a big surprise that it has not been found before in meteorites. The delicate collection of 121.6 grams (4.3 ounces) of material by OSIRIS-REx might have kept this and other dainty molecules safe. Coincidentally, the sample came back to Earth on September 24, 2023. Receive weekly science coverage direct to your inbox</p>

An effort aimed at conspiracy theorists follows the marketer enacting its first brand platform relaunch in a decade with Adam&eveDDB. Boyle explains the stakes in humorous social videos where a lawyer intervenes to correct him about what the process for handing off the winnings would entail and employees act befuddled as he tries to showcase all that's at stake. So here's the deal: it's time to put your map where your mouth is,” writes Boyle in an open letter running in the Times. Taking flat-earthers to task could inspire online chatter about Columbia around the key holiday shopping period, and the brand will directly inject itself into online communities where farfetched ideas are heatedly discussed. “Expedition Impossible” is part of Columbia's efforts to put forward bolder, conversation-starting marketing following its first brand platform relaunch in a decade. The marketer in August debuted “Engineered for Whatever,” a multiseason ad campaign that uses edgy, over-the-top humor to illustrate the toughness of its products under extreme conditions. “Engineered for Whatever” is meant to serve as a counter to what Columbia views as overly pristine, idyllic outdoors marketing from rivals. Adam&eveDDB is the Portland, Oregon-based brand's global agency of record and helped develop “Expedition Impossible.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Already beleaguered CMOs are being forced to be more agile than ever in the face of a new round of challenges like trade wars and artificial intelligence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new project, officially launched last month, was made possible by an endowment gift that will provide ongoing funding for the team's scientific investigation of aerial mysteries, which are currently also being investigated in a separate effort by the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). “We've been working on studying UAP scientifically for about seven years now,” Knuth explained, adding that his entry into the study of aerial mysteries began with an examination of the many decades of information that have been collected on the topic. “I started by just doing what a physicist ought to do, which is getting your head around the problem,” Knuth told The Debrief. This ultimately led to his collaboration with scientists from the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies to author a 2019 paper that estimated the minimum speeds and accelerations of UAP observed in several notable cases. Among these was a 2004 incident involving an object observed by U.S. Navy personnel aboard the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) during training exercises off the southern California coast. Footage of the object, popularly known today as the “Tic Tac,” was obtained by an FA/18 Super Hornet pilot named Chad Underwood and subsequently leaked online. That incident, Knuth says, had been part of what led him and fellow University of Albany physicist and associate professor Matthew Szydagis, along with several colleagues, to conduct a field expedition in 2021 off the coast of Santa Catalina Island with a non-profit scientific research organization called UAPx. That work culminated in a paper by Szydagis and co-authored by Knuth and their colleague, University of Albany associate professor Cecilia Levy—the core of the new UAlbany Project X initiative—published in Progress in Aerospace Sciences earlier this year. “This was a really seminal paper,” Szydagis told The Debrief, describing it as “a summary of UAPx's first results from the Catalina-Laguna mission.” Enter Tony Gorman, a well-known Albany-area businessman with many years of experience who was previously a co-owner of The Gorman Group, a family-owned highway construction company that has operated in the area for many decades. Gorman had seen a short local news story about the UAP research Knuth, Szydagis, and Levy were conducting at the University of Albany, which prompted him to reach out to the team to help ensure an ongoing source of funding for their work. “I have always been curious about UAPs and what could possibly be out there,” Gorman said in a statement. Gorman reached out and, after a series of discussions with the UAlbany researchers, decided to put his money behind their scientific efforts. “I gained so much respect for their work,” Gorman said. “We received this donation from Tony Gorman,” Knuth told The Debrief. “A generous donation, which basically funds us for five years, and in addition to that, sets up an endowment that funds us in perpetuity.” “With Tony's very generous gift, we have the potential ability to be working on UAP for the rest of our lives.” As for what the team specifically plans to work on, Szydagis explained that part of its plan is to leverage knowledge from past research while carefully plotting a course forward through strategic investigations that will help the physicists expand the data they are collecting on UAP. “Through an incredibly generous gift from Tony Gorman, Professors Knuth, Matthey Szydagis, and Cecilia Levy have secured a major endowment to launch UAlbany Project X (UAPx)—the direct academic continuation of everything we've built from scratch,” wrote Gary Voorhis, a U.S. Navy veteran and former CEO and co-founder of the original nonprofit UAPx. Scientists Have Revealed a Crucial Step in How Early Life May Have Originated on Our Planet, and Earth Isn't the Only Place it Could be Happening. They took our little rag-tag expedition team and turned it into a funded, university-backed research program with the potential to run for decades,” Voorhis wrote. “We are deeply honored to have him,” Dr. Szydagis told The Debrief. “There has been a lot of excellent work done,” Knuth added, although noting that he hopes UAlbany Project X will be able to take scientific approaches to UAP research into new and exciting areas. “We have plans to build arrays of cameras to watch the sky and have this portable,” Knuth told The Debrief. “You should expect more papers from us, not just field expeditions,” Szydagis told The Debrief. And now we can start working on more of these things.” “We no longer have to just work on this for free in our volunteer time,” Szydagis added, “which is not sustainable long-term.” A longtime reporter on science, defense, and technology with a focus on space and astronomy, he can be reached at micah@thedebrief.org.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Downton Abbey star looks totally unrecognisable sporting a very different look in the 'absorbing' supernatural Netflix thriller Talamasca: The Secret Order. The supernatural horror spy thriller, which is based on Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles and Lives of the Mayfair Witches, premiered on AMC in October this year. 'A young lawyer with an unusual gift joins an ancient, secretive agency to unravel a supernatural mystery - and confront his family's dark past,' the streaming service's synopsis reads. Another actress in the programme is Elizabeth McGovern - who has taken on the role of Helen. Many will know Elizabeth for a number of other roles including Ordinary People, The Handmaid's Tale and The Wife. She also played Cora, Countess of Grantham, in Downton Abbey between 2010 and 2015. Helen new character looks totally different to her alter-ego on the ITV drama. In Downton Abbey, the star rocked brunette hair, while in the new series, she's got a much lighter platinum bob and vampy makeup. 'Looking forward to seeing where this goes and if it keeps going after recently revealing their main plot. 'Its a breath of fresh air compared to other fantasy adventure shows out there. My only common is it needs to showcase mo powers, less talk.' 'Excellent so far, brilliant casting, so happy - finally someone's building a good story, creating a mood, clever writing and good performances. 'I'm excited to see if they'll maintain the quality, but based on what I've seen so far, it's very well done. Looks like very high quality to me, and is elevated above the usual pedestrian tedium and predictable scripts.' 'The cliffhangers on the final episode make me excited and hopeful for a second season.' 'Talamasca is one of those rare supernatural shows that feels fresh, intelligent, and genuinely atmospheric. 'Instead of relying on cheap scares or flashy effects, it leans into world-building, character depth, and a slow-burning sense of mystery - and it absolutely works.' Damn I still don't have enough. 'There's a great plot and interesting characters. It keeps me guessing and I'm always on the edge of my seat watching. Many are desperate to know if there will be a second series. And although nothing has been confirmed, protagonist Nicholas Denton has hinted that he wants the programme to make a return. He told TV Insider: 'The first season's really interesting because you've got to start. 'You're setting up a new world, new lore, new characters, you're building them up, and you want to set them free, let 'em go nuts on the world. He added that 'there's the rest of the world to cover' and 'there's a lot to unpack' with Guy and Doris (Celine Buckens). Talamasca: The Secret Order was created by John Lee Hancock and the showrunners include John and Mark Lafferty. The likes of Tomi May, Will Brown, Bryony Hannah, Eric Bogosian and Jason Schwartzman also appear on the programme.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aston Martin F1 star Fernando Alonso has described his car as having 'disconnections' that are a 'bit paranormal' following a good result at the Qatar Grand Prix. However, he was lucky to get away with a spin on lap 42, which spun him around 360 degrees, and he carried on in the race without too much bother. After the race, Alonso tried to explain what happened to cause him to spin around despite not having contact with any other car, and suggested that there could be paranormal forces at play. "No, I was taking it easy," Alonso told media after the race. "The truth is that I wasn't pushing 100%, but this car has disconnections, I don't know what to call them, a bit paranormal, there's a spirit inside the car." "Then yesterday, I suddenly lost the front end for three or four corners. It was as if I had no front wheels. "And today it was the rear wheels, suddenly a lash, so we're hypersensitive to the wind, hypersensitive to one or two degrees of temperature, we're always on a knife edge and today I made that mistake, but fortunately I was very lucky that there was no gravel, that there was nothing and that I didn't have a train of cars behind me." His recent flurry of points since the Spanish GP in June has come despite him having to drive such an inconsistent Aston Martin car, and he is sincerely hoping that the team can improve for the final year of his current contract. Aston Martin are a very ambitious team, and are hoping to be challenging for race wins in the near future, taking on the likes of design legend Adrian Newey and Ferrari stalwart Enrico Cardile in their attempts to do so.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A former soldier who participated in leaflet-dropping operations against North Korea has testified that the Defense Psychological Operation Group, a unit directly under the Ministry of National Defense, secretly sent leaflets to North Korea from October 2023 until just before the emergency martial law declaration on Dec. 3, 2024. While some media reports previously indicated that propaganda leaflets were sent by military authorities as well as civilian groups during the Yoon Suk-yeol administration, this is the first time a soldier involved in the operation has provided testimony. The Defense Psychological Operation Group, or DPOG, is a unit tasked with conducting psychological warfare operations, such as distributing leaflets and broadcasting via loudspeakers, in times of emergency. The whistleblower's unit reportedly conducted operations about once or twice every two months from then until November 2024. From then on, according to the former soldier, the unit released about 100 balloons per operation, each carrying approximately 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of leaflets. “Before the Constitutional Court's decision, we conducted leaflet distribution training in rear bases. He added that he and others conducted realistic training for about a month and then, the following month in October, actually sent balloons carrying leaflets to North Korea. They then calculated wind direction and speed in real-time to determine the most suitable targets for leaflet balloons. “Around 9 to 11 pm, unit members would change out of their military uniforms, which had their names and unit affiliations, into black clothing worn by special operations personnel before being deployed for the operation,” the former soldier said. Rep. Boo Seung-chan of the Democratic Party, who has been tracking the DPOG's leaflet activities, said that the operations were part of Yoon's plan to concoct an excuse for invoking martial law. “The Yoon administration sought to provoke North Korea not only with drones infiltrating Pyongyang but also with propaganda leaflets in order to create justification for declaring martial law,” Boo said.
