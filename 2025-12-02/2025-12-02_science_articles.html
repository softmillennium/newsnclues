A tiny, single-celled amoeba that can thrive at temperatures that kill all other known complex life — organisms whose cells contain a nucleus and internal structures — has been found. The discovery questions the notion that such ‘eukaryotic' life — which includes all animals and plants — is not suited to the kind of extreme conditions that can be tolerated by bacteria and other organisms lacking a cell nucleus. The work, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was described in a preprint1 published on 24 November. Oliverio and fellow Syracuse microbiologist Beryl Rappaport were part of a team that discovered the organism at Lassen Volcanic National Park in northern California's Cascade mountain range. They named it Incendiamoeba cascadensis, which translates to ‘fire amoeba from the cascades'. The park is famous for gurgling acid lakes and incandescent geothermal pools, but I. cascadensis comes from a pH-neutral ‘hot stream'. “It's the most uninteresting geothermal feature you'll find in Lassen,” says Rappaport. Correction 02 December 2025: In an earlier version of this article Incendiamoeba cascadensis was spelled incorrectly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Known today as Poverty Point—a name derived from a 19th-century plantation that was located near the archaeological site—this approximately 3,500-year-old structure (built sometime between 1700 B.C.E. It's long been known that Poverty Point served as a kind of trading hub for ancient hunter-gatherers spread throughout southeastern and midwestern U.S. Typically, years-long intentional monument building is the work of hierarchies, like those of the pharaohs ruling Egyptians, kings governing Hittites, and Chinese rulers lording over their subjects. But Kidder and his co-author Seth Grooms (a former WashU PhD graduate and a member of the Lumbee tribe of North Carolina) believe that Poverty Point was the work of an egalitarian civilization coming to grips with increased severe weather and massive flooding in the region. This goes against the previously held belief that this society must have also been hierarchical in nature, similar to the society that constructed Cahokia Mounds a thousand years later near present-day St. Louis, Missouri. “The Western view is that they wouldn't travel all of that distance and do all of that work unless they were getting something of economic value out of it,” the study's co-author, Tristram Kidder, said in the WashU magazine The Ampersand. “The old paradigm that people lived at Poverty Point continuously for centuries has been crumbling, and we needed a new framework,” Kidder told The Ampersand. Instead, what they found were materials such as quartz crystal from Arkansas, soapstone from northern Georgia, and pieces of Great Lakes copper. Kidder and Grooms believe that Poverty Point was a temporary gathering spot for people assembled in the thousands to do what humans do: socialize, trade, worship, and work. “These people came together to build these incredible monuments, and according to the archaeological evidence, they did it in the absence of any kind of institutional hierarchy, wealth differences, or intensive agricultural systems,” Grooms said at the time. “All of that was once thought to be a prerequisite for social complexity.” Ancient Plants May Show the Site of Jesus's Tomb A Missing World War II Destroyer Has Been Found Gut Feelings Are Memories From the Future, Scientists Say Scientists Just Upended the Age of Life on Earth</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The collection of markings is now thought to have been left by a herd of ancient sea turtles that had been frightened off by a sudden earthquake. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. But one day, ominous rumblings from below sent them scattering en masse, and their frantic flipper marks were frozen in time. The sheer cliff where the footprints lie over La Vela Beach is over 328 feet (100 meters) above sea level, but that didn't stop Montanari and his research team. “We hypothesized that the footprints, which were probably made by a group of medium-sized marine vertebrates paddling towards southwest on a soft pelagic seafloor, were preserved on that oozy sediment because they were immediately buried and sealed under a calcilutitic turbidite,” Montanari said in a study recently published in Cretaceous Research. What creature could have left so many of these traces as it swam away? While the bones of many marine species have been found preserved in limestone that was once underwater, nothing with prints of their feet, fins, or paddles has ever surfaced. Such prints would not have lasted long on a seafloor of oozing sediment—they would have easily been erased by the flow of water or washed away by deep currents. Because fish do not paddle on the sand with their fins, Montanari and his team needed to consider the types of marine reptiles that were around during that period. They thought it was possible that the tracks came from either mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, or sea turtles from the extinct lineage Protostegidaae, even though no fossilized remains of these sea turtles or plesiosaurs had been found in the region. While ancient sea turtles and plesiosaurs were both mostly solitary creatures, females of most extant sea turtle species will migrate over long distances and in herds to lay their eggs on tropical beaches. In addition, the Hawaiian green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) and Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) are both known to inhabit shallow reefs, and sometimes swim close to the seafloor and brush the sand with their fore-flippers. The environments in which these turtles live are similar to what Monte Cònero and La Vela beach are imagined to have been like tens of millions of years ago. “The prevalence of sea turtle species in these environments leads us to hypothesize that the myriad trace fossils of the La Vela Slabs represent a mass displacement of a very large number of these animals,” said Montanari, who thinks the ancient critters were probably foraging when they were spooked. When the already panicked sea turtles tried to escape, some were so close to the seafloor that they left flipper tracks in their wake. The earthquake released calcilutitic fluxoturbidite—coarse deposits mixed with fine-grained sediment that would turn into limestone—which buried and preserved the soft carbonate sediment and its record of a sea turtle mass exodus. Earthquake activity at this time coincides with the period of climate change known as the Early Campanian Event, which was thought to have been triggered by an asteroid impact. It could lead to discovering something that has been waiting to be found for tens or even hundreds of millions of years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Around 12,000 years ago, the last Ice Age drew to a close. Global temperatures rose, the early Holocene began, and human communities gradually shifted toward more permanent settlements. A new study published in Nature Geoscience highlights how the Southern Ocean around Antarctica helped drive this major climate transition. "In earlier studies, we noticed that the neodymium signature in the deep South Atlantic only reached its modern composition around 12,000 years ago. But the real question was: What could generate such a signal? Such an exotic isotopic signature can only develop when deep water remains almost motionless for extended periods. Stagnant deep waters, carbon storage and the last Ice Age During the last Ice Age, the cold and very dense deep water that currently forms around Antarctica did not spread as widely as it does today. Instead, much of the deep Southern Ocean was filled with carbon-rich waters that originated in the Pacific, a glacial precursor to today's Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). As Earth warmed and ice sheets retreated between roughly 18,000 and 10,000 years ago, the volume of Antarctic Bottom Water increased in two clear phases. These expansion phases occurred at the same time as known warming events in Antarctica. "Warming around Antarctica reduced sea-ice cover, resulting in more meltwater entering the Southern Ocean. The Antarctic Bottom Water formed during this transitional climate period had a lower density due to reduced salinity. This late-glacial AABW was able to spread further through the Southern Ocean, destabilizing the existing water-mass structure and enhancing exchanges between deep and surface waters." The new results suggest that this northern influence was more restricted than earlier thought. If we understand how the ocean responded to warming in the past, we can better grasp what is happening today as Antarctic ice shelves continue to melt." To work out how this rapid deep-ocean warming affects the ability of the ocean to absorb and release carbon dioxide, scientists must track physical and biogeochemical changes over long timescales and incorporate them into climate models. Paleoclimate data obtained from sediment cores are indispensable for this, offering insights into past climates that were warmer than today and helping to improve projections of future climate change.

Retrons are prokaryotic genetic elements involved in anti-phage defense and consist of a non-coding RNA, a reverse transcriptase (RT), and various effector proteins. Retron-Eco7 (previously known as Retron-Ec78) from Escherichia coli encodes two effector proteins (the PtuA ATPase and the PtuB nuclease) and degrades the host tRNATyr upon phage infection, thereby protecting host cells against invading phages. However, its defense mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the Retron-Eco7 complex, comprising the RT, multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA), PtuA, and PtuB. The Retron-Eco7 structures reveal that the RT–msDNA complex associates with two PtuA–PtuB complexes, potentially inhibiting their nuclease activity and suppressing bacterial growth arrest prior to phage infection. Our data indicate that msDNA cleavage by D15 is the initial step required for the specific cleavage of the host tRNATyr by the PtuA–PtuB nuclease, which leads to abortive infection. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insights into the Retron-Eco7 system and highlights the diversity of prokaryotic anti-phage defense mechanisms. Prokaryotes have evolved a variety of defense mechanisms to combat foreign nucleic acids, such as phages and plasmids1,2,3,4. Some of these systems, including restriction-modification systems and CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems, directly target and eliminate invading nucleic acids5,6. In contrast, abortive infection systems induce cell dormancy or death upon infection, thereby preventing phage propagation and protecting the cell population7. Retrons are prokaryotic genetic elements consisting of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA), a reverse transcriptase (RT), and diverse effector proteins, and are classified into 13 types based on the type of effector proteins8,9. The ncRNA contains msr and msd regions (hereafter referred to as msrRNA and msdRNA, respectively), with two inverted repeat regions (a1 in the msrRNA and a2 in the msdRNA)10 (Fig. Subsequently, the msdRNA is degraded by RNase H1, producing a unique RNA–DNA hybrid with a 2′-5′ covalent linkage (known as multi-copy single-stranded DNA (msDNA))11,12,13. Retron systems have been harnessed for genome engineering technologies, due to their ability to produce high copy numbers of DNA with customizable sequences8,14,15,16,17.

E. coli cells transformed with an empty vector were used as the control. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. e Growth curves of E. coli cells expressing Retron-Eco7, PtuA–PtuB, dPtuA–PtuB (PtuA D395A), or PtuA–dPtuB (PtuB H57A).

The first retron was discovered in 198410, but its biological functions have remained elusive for decades. However, recent studies revealed that retron elements function as toxin-antitoxin systems, with the RT–msDNA complex acting as the antitoxin and its cognate effector protein as the toxin, thus protecting bacterial cells against phage infections through diverse mechanisms18,19,20. In addition, recent studies of Retron-Eco1 (also known as Retron-Ec86) revealed that the RT–msDNA complex associates with its N-glycosidase effector to form a filament capable of hydrolyzing NAD(P)+, thereby providing mechanistic insights into Retron-Eco1-mediated anti-phage defense21,22,23. Retron-Eco7 (also known as Retron-Ec78) comprises an RT, a 144-nucleotide (nt) ncRNA, and two effector proteins, PtuA (the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family ATPase) and PtuB (the HNH nuclease)18,19,24 (Fig. Recently, we reported that the Retron-Eco7 system cleaves the host tRNATyr and participates in anti-phage defense, which is inhibited by a phage-encoded tRNA25. However, the action mechanism of Retron-Eco7 remains unknown. In this study, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the Retron-Eco7 complex, consisting of one RT–msDNA complex and two PtuA–PtuB complexes. Our structural and functional data indicate that RT–msDNA associates with PtuA–PtuB, thereby suppressing bacterial growth arrest prior to phage infection. We further found that the phage-encoded D15 nuclease cleaves the msDNA within the Retron-Eco7 complex, facilitating the dissociation of PtuA–PtuB, which leads to host tRNATyr cleavage and ultimately abortive infection. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into anti-phage defense by Retron-Eco7 and highlight the mechanistic diversity of prokaryotic defense systems. We then infected the bacterial cells with either T-series phages (T1–T7), the SP15 phage, which is highly similar to the wild-type (WT) T5 phage, or the mutant SP15 phage (SP15m), which lacks the anti-defense protein Rad and tRNATyr (SP-tRNATyr)25 (Supplementary Fig. Using spot assays, we subsequently examined the defense activity of Retron-Eco7 against these phages. Consistent with our recent study25, Retron-Eco7 protected E. coli against T5 and SP15m, but not SP15 (Fig. 1d), suggesting that the enzymatic activities of both PtuA (ATPase) and PtuB (nuclease) are essential for Retron-Eco7-mediated anti-phage defense. Next, we monitored the growth of E. coli cells containing Retron-Eco7 after infection with SP15m. The expression of PtuA and PtuB, but not Retron-Eco7 (RT–ncRNA–PtuA–PtuB), inhibited bacterial growth without phage infection (Fig. 1e), suggesting that PtuA–PtuB and RT–msDNA function as a toxin and an antitoxin, respectively. A mutation in either PtuA (D395A) or PtuB (H57A) abolished the toxicity of PtuA–PtuB (Fig. 1e), indicating that the enzymatic activities of both PtuA and PtuB are crucial for growth inhibition. E. coli cells containing Retron-Eco7 exhibited normal growth under low multiplicity of infection (MOI) conditions, whereas their growth was inhibited under high MOI conditions (Fig. Collectively, these results indicate that Retron-Eco7 protects E. coli against phage infection through an abortive infection mechanism. To explore the defense mechanism of Retron-Eco7, we initially examined whether its defense activity is affected by the addition of affinity tags to the Retron-Eco7 components. We confirmed that the Retron-Eco7 system, comprising the ncRNA, His6-tagged RT, PtuA, and Twin-Strep-tagged PtuB, exhibits comparable activity to that of the untagged system (Supplementary Fig. Thus, we co-expressed the tagged Retron-Eco7 system in E. coli, isolated the complex using Strep-Tactin resin, and further purified it by size-exclusion chromatography (Supplementary Fig. Our analysis confirmed that the msDNA is an RNA–DNA hybrid consisting of a ~ 40-nt msrRNA and an ~80-nt msdDNA (Supplementary Fig. 2a), indicating that the msdRNA region in the ncRNA was reverse-transcribed by the RT to produce the msdDNA, which was then processed in E. coli, as previously described24,26. We determined the cryo-EM structures of the RT–msDNA–PtuA–PtuB complex (referred to as the Retron-Eco7 complex) in five distinct states (states 1–5) at 2.6–2.8-Å resolutions (Fig. The cryo-EM structure revealed that the Retron-Eco7 complex consists of an RT molecule, an msDNA molecule, four PtuA molecules (PtuA.1–PtuA.4), and two PtuB molecules (PtuB.1 and PtuB.2), except for state 5, which contains an additional RT–msDNA complex (RT.2 and msDNA.2) (Fig. PtuA.1 and PtuA.2 interact with PtuA.4 and PtuA.3 via their coiled-coil domains, respectively, forming a tetrameric assembly surrounding the msdDNA. Since the C-terminal domain of a PtuB molecule is sandwiched between the C-terminal domains of two PtuA molecules, the PtuB molecules (PtuB.1 and PtuB.2) can bind to the PtuA dimers (PtuA.1–PtuA.2 and PtuA.3–PtuA.4) in two distinct orientations (Supplementary Fig. Consequently, states 1–4 are structurally similar, except for the orientations of PtuB relative to the PtuA dimers. In state 5, RT.2 interacts with PtuA.4, msDNA.1, and msDNA.2 (Supplementary Fig. Similar to states 1–4, the DNA region of msDNA.1 is recognized by the two PtuA dimers, while the corresponding region of msDNA.2 is largely disordered and forms only a few contacts with the proteins, suggesting that a single RT–msDNA module is sufficient for the assembly of the Retron-Eco7 complex. Since the structures in states 1–5 are essentially similar and likely functionally relevant, we focus on the structure of state 1 unless otherwise stated. In the Retron-Eco7 structure, the msDNA consists of a 41-nt msrRNA (nucleotides (−58)–(−18)) and a 73-nt msdDNA (nucleotides 5–77), with nucleotides (−55)–(−50) in the msrRNA and nucleotides 72–77 in the msdDNA forming an RNA–DNA heteroduplex (Fig. The present structure reveals that nucleotides 1–77 in the msdDNA are reverse-transcribed, whereas a previous study reported that the Retron-Eco7 msDNA contains a 78-nucleotide msdDNA (thus, Retron-Eco7 was formerly called Retron-Ec78)24. Similarly, the recently reported Retron-Eco1 structure showed that its msDNA contains an 85-nucleotide msdDNA21,22,23, which is one nucleotide shorter than previously reported27. These discrepancies might arise from incorrect estimations of msdDNA lengths in earlier biochemical studies24,27. In the present structure, the msrRNA contains a linker region (referred to as L1, nucleotides (−49)–(−40)) and stem loop 2 (SL2, nucleotides (−39)–(−18)), while the msdDNA contains stem loop 3 (SL3, nucleotides 5–64) and a linker region (referred to as L2, nucleotides 65–71) (Fig. No densities were observed for nucleotides 0–(−17) in the msrRNA and nucleotides 1–4 in the msdDNA (Fig. 4c), consistent with our data indicating that these regions were processed by endogenous nucleases in E. coli (Supplementary Fig. Overall, these observations confirmed that the msDNA in the Retron-Eco7 complex exists as a non-branched RNA–DNA hybrid, as previously reported24,26. a Nucleotide sequence of the msDNA.

The defense activities (PFU/mL) were evaluated by spot assays. E. coli cells transformed with an empty vector were used as the control. Data represent the mean ± SD of four independent replicates (n = 4), and no statistical analysis was performed. The RT in Retron-Eco7 (RT-Eco7) is structurally similar to other known RTs, such as the RT in Retron-Eco1 (RT-Eco1)21,22,23 and the RT domain of the Bombyx mori R2 retrotransposon (RT-R2Bm)28,29, and adopts a right-hand-shaped fold consisting of palm, finger, and thumb domains (Fig. SL2 and L1/L2 of the msDNA are extensively recognized by the thumb and palm/finger domains, respectively, while stem loop 3 forms only a few contacts with the palm domain at its 5′ end (Figs. A structural comparison of RT-Eco7 with RT-R2Bm revealed that, in the Retron-Eco7 structure, the binding site of an incoming nucleotide is occupied by A(–47) in the msrRNA L1 linker (Fig. 5a), while the template nucleotide U(–49) is flipped out from the heteroduplex and forms hydrogen bonds with Q46 (finger) and A69 (L2), with its nucleobase stacked between Y32 (finger) and A70 (L2) (Figs. Thus, the present structure represents a termination state in the reverse-transcription reaction. In addition, the Y32A, R42A, and Q46A mutations moderately or substantially reduced the activity (Fig. The residues that interact with nucleic acids through their main chains are shown in parentheses. While the msrRNA and msdDNA regions of Retron-Eco7 share sequence similarity with those of Retron-Eco1, the structures of their msdDNA regions differ substantially (Supplementary Fig. In the Retron-Eco1 structure, SL2 and L1/L2 of the msDNA are recognized by the RT in a manner similar to that observed in the Retron-Eco7 structure, with the RT active site occluded by an adenosine corresponding to A(–47) of the Retron-Eco7 msrRNA21,22,23 (Supplementary Fig. These structural findings suggest that Retron-RT-mediated reverse transcription terminates at a specific position in the msdRNA, with the termination site defined by interactions between the RT and SL2–L2 in the msrRNA, consistent with previous biochemical data22. However, there are notable structural differences between the Retron-Eco7 and Retron-Eco1 complexes. In addition, the orientation of msdDNA SL3 in the Retron-Eco1 complex differs from that in the Retron-Eco7 complex (Supplementary Fig. Together, these observations highlight both the conserved and divergent structural features among the RT–msDNA complexes in different retron systems. PtuA consists of an N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1–63), an ATPase domain (residues 64–254 and 311–442), a coiled-coil (CC) domain (residues 255–310), a linker domain (residues 443–483), and a C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 484–550) (Fig. The NTD comprises three α-helices and two β-strands. Two N-terminal α-helices in the PtuA.1 NTD interact with RT–msDNA, while those of PtuA.2, PtuA.3, and PtuA.4 are less resolved in the density map, due to the lack of interactions (Fig. The CC domain comprises two α-helices and mediates PtuA–PtuA interactions, while the CTD contains three α-helices and participates in PtuA–PtuB interactions (Fig. a Domain structures of PtuA and PtuB. b Structure of the Retron-Eco7 complex.

Data represent the mean ± SD of four independent replicates (n = 4). e In vitro ATPase activity of the WT and mutant Retron-Eco7 complex and PtuA alone, measured by an NADH-coupled assay. The purified Retron-Eco7 complex (either WT, PtuA D395A (dPtuA), or PtuB H57A (dPtuB)) or PtuA alone was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a reaction buffer containing 10 mM ATP and 0.3 mM NADH, and NADH oxidation was monitored by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. ATPase activities were calculated based on the NADH oxidation rates determined from five data points between 15 and 20 min. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent replicates (n = 3). Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. i Anti-phage defense activities of WT Retron-Eco7 and its mutants against the SP15m phage, evaluated by spot assays.

Data represent the mean ± SD of three biological replicates (n = 3). The ATPase domain adopts an ABC ATPase fold with the Walker A (93-GNNGKGKT-100) and Walker B (391-IVLIDE-396) motifs (Fig. Similar to other known ATPases30, the ATPase domains of PtuA.1 and PtuA.3 interact with those of PtuA.2 and PtuA.4, respectively, to form head-to-head dimers, which are further stabilized by their linker domains (Supplementary Fig. In contrast, one ADP molecule is bound at the PtuA.3–PtuA.4 interface, as the Walker A motif in PtuA.3 adopts an α-helical conformation rather than a loop conformation, for unknown reasons (Supplementary Fig. In the ADP-bound PtuA ATPase domains (PtuA.1, PtuA.2, and PtuA.4), N95 (Walker A) and E396 (Walker B) in one protomer form hydrogen bonds with H400/H402 and H400 in the neighboring protomer, respectively, stabilizing the dimer interface (Fig. Notably, the N95A, E396A, and H400A mutations abolished the anti-phage defense activity in E. coli (Fig. 4d), indicating that the ADP-mediated dimerization of PtuA is essential for the Retron-Eco7 function. The Retron-Eco7 complex, but not PtuA alone, hydrolyzed ATP to produce ADP, while the PtuA D395A mutation, but not the PtuB H57A mutation, abolished the ATPase activity (Fig. These results indicate that PtuA functions as an active ATPase within the Retron-Eco7 complex. Thus, the bound ADP molecules are likely produced from ATP in E. coli cells via the PtuA ATPase activity within the Retron-Eco7 complex. Given that an E-to-Q mutation in the Walker B motif of the Rad50 ATPase abolished ATP hydrolysis while retaining ATP binding31, we examined the anti-phage defense activity of the Retron-Eco7 complex containing the equivalent PtuA E396Q mutation in the Walker B motif. 4d), indicating that PtuA-mediated ATP hydrolysis, rather than ATP binding alone, is necessary for the Retron-Eco7 function. These findings suggest that, within the Retron-Eco7 complex, PtuA continuously hydrolyzes ATP to produce ADP, which stabilizes the PtuA dimer and facilitates the interaction between RT–msDNA and PtuA–PtuB. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the stability of the WT and mutant Retron-Eco7 complexes using size-exclusion chromatography. The WT and PtuB H57A mutant complexes eluted as single peaks (Supplementary Fig. 8c), indicating that the PtuA-mediated ADP production is essential for the interaction between RT–msDNA and PtuA–PtuB. This mechanism is reminiscent of that for the Rad50 ATPase, where ATP binding promotes Rad50 dimerization and enhances DNA interactions31,32,33. Unlike the PtuA D395A mutation, the PtuB H57A mutation did not cause dissociation of the complex but instead increased its aggregation (Supplementary Fig. Taken together, these data indicate that PtuA hydrolyzes ATP to generate ADP, thus helping to maintain the structural integrity of the Retron-Eco7 complex. PtuB consists of an HNH nuclease domain (residues 1–152) and a C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 153–216) (Fig. The HNH domain of PtuB is similar to other HNH domains34, such as those of PtuB from the Septu defense system35 and Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9)36,37 (Supplementary Fig. The HNH domain of PtuB contains a conserved histidine residue (H57) and resembles that of SpCas9 in its active, rather than inactive, conformation (Supplementary Fig. 9b–d), suggesting that PtuB in the Retron-Eco7 complex adopts a nearly active conformation. Unlike the other HNH domains, the PtuB HNH domain contains a zinc finger, in which a zinc ion is coordinated by C43, C46, C78, and C90 (Supplementary Fig. Alanine substitutions of these cysteine residues (C43A/C46A/C78A/C90A) abolished the defense activity (Fig. The CTD of PtuB contains three α-helices and interacts with the CTDs of PtuA (Fig. The two PtuA–PtuB complexes associate with the RT–msDNA scaffold primarily through interactions between the msdDNA and the PtuA dimers, while PtuB.1 and PtuB.2 interact with PtuA.1–PtuA.2 and PtuA.3–PtuA.4 through their CTDs, respectively (Figs. Specifically, residues R126, R163, R171, and K180 of PtuA.1, PtuA.3, and PtuA.4 interact with the nucleobases or backbone phosphate groups of the msdDNA (Figs. Mutations of these residues resulted in mild (R171A and K180A) or substantial (R126A and R163A) reductions in Retron-Eco7-mediated anti-phage defense (Fig. Consistently, E. coli cells expressing Retron-Eco7 with either the R126A or R163A mutation in PtuA exhibited growth defects, as observed in E. coli cells expressing only PtuA–PtuB (Fig. Among the four PtuA molecules, PtuA.1 interacts with the msrRNA sugar-phosphate backbone, with its NTD contacting both stem loop 2 and the linker region in the msrRNA (Figs. Deletion of the two N-terminal α-helices (residues 3–36) of PtuA abolished the anti-phage defense activity (Fig. The D521R mutation, but not E471R, K526E, and R533E, in PtuA reduced the anti-phage defense activity (Fig. Deletions of the PtuA CC domain (residues 260–305), PtuA CTD (residues 484–550), and PtuB CTD (residues 135–216) also reduced the defense activity (Fig. 4i), suggesting that these domains are essential for the complex formation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the formation of the RT–msDNA–PtuA–PtuB complex is essential for Retron-Eco7-mediated anti-phage defense. Our recent study indicated that E. coli tRNATyr (Ec-tRNATyr) is degraded by the Retron-Eco7 system upon phage infection, leading to abortive infection25. To investigate whether Ec-tRNATyr is cleaved by the Retron-Eco7 system, we infected E. coli cells (with or without Retron-Eco7) with the SP15m phage, extracted total RNA from the cells at 20 min post infection, and detected Ec-tRNATyr using northern blotting. We observed cleavage fragments of Ec-tRNATyr in the lysates from SP15m-infected E. coli cells containing Retron-Eco7, but not in those lacking Retron-Eco7 (Supplementary Fig. In contrast, cleavage products were not detected in the lysates from SP15m-uninfected cells, regardless of the presence of Retron-Eco7 (Supplementary Fig. These results indicated that Ec-tRNATyr is cleaved by the Retron-Eco7 system upon phage infection. Mutations in either PtuA (D395A) or PtuB (H57A) resulted in the loss of Ec-tRNATyr cleavage fragments (Supplementary Fig. 10a), confirming that both PtuA and PtuB are necessary for tRNATyr cleavage. To determine the cleavage site of Ec-tRNATyr, we performed tRNA fragment sequencing on total RNA extracted from SP15-infected E. coli cells with Retron-Eco7, as well as from SP15-uninfected cells with only PtuA–PtuB. We detected an Ec-tRNATyr fragment downstream of U47 in the total tRNA from both cell types (Supplementary Fig. 10b), indicating that the Retron-Eco7 system is activated upon phage infection, with PtuA–PtuB cleaving Ec-tRNATyr between U47 and C48 in the variable loop region. Our recent study showed that SP15 phage-encoded tRNATyr (SP-tRNATyr) suppresses the Retron-Eco7-mediated anti-phage defense25. To explore its mechanism, we infected E. coli cells (with or without Retron-Eco7) with either SP15 or the tRNATyr-lacking SP15 mutant (SP15m), and then visualized Ec-tRNATyr, SP-tRNATyr, and E. coli tRNAGly (Ec-tRNAGly) using northern blotting. In E. coli cells with Retron-Eco7, Ec-tRNATyr, but neither SP-tRNATyr nor Ec-tRNAGly, was cleaved after phage infection (Fig. Both Ec-tRNATyr and SP-tRNATyr possess longer variable loops as compared to other tRNAs, such as Ec-tRNAGly (Fig. 10c, d), consistent with the observation that Ec-tRNAGly was not cleaved by Retron-Eco7. Co-expression of Retron-Eco7 with SP-tRNATyr, but not with Ec-tRNATyr, in E. coli led to the loss of defense against SP15m (Fig. In contrast, co-expression of Retron-Eco7 with SP-tRNATyr mutants, in which the variable loop (A47–U59) was deleted or replaced with the 5-nt shorter loop of Ec-tRNATyr, provided defense against SP15m (Fig. 5c), highlighting the importance of the variable loop of SP-tRNATyr for Retron-Eco7 inhibition. Furthermore, E. coli cells expressing PtuA–PtuB with either Ec-tRNATyr or SP-tRNATyr exhibited normal growth (Fig. Collectively, these results suggest that SP-tRNATyr compensates for the decreased levels of Ec-tRNATyr, thereby leading to the suppression of the Retron-Eco7 anti-phage defense. a Northern blot analysis of Ec-tRNATyr, SP-tRNATyr, and Ec-tRNAGly. Total RNA was extracted from E. coli cells (with or without Retron-Eco7) with or without phage infection (SP15 or SP15m), and resolved by 10% denaturing urea-PAGE. Total RNA was visualized using ethidium bromide, while Ec-tRNATyr, SP-tRNATyr, and Ec-tRNAGly were individually detected using northern blotting. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. b Schematics of Ec-tRNATyr and SP-tRNATyr. tRNA modifications are omitted for clarity. c Suppression of Retron-Eco7 by the phage-encoded SP-tRNATyr. E. coli cells were transformed with WT Retron-Eco7 together with either Ec-tRNATyr, SP-tRNATyr, or SP-tRNATyr mutants (V-loop deletion or chimera), and their defense activities against SP15m were evaluated using spot assays. The variable loop (G47–C60) of SP-tRNAᵀʸʳ was deleted and replaced with that of Ec-tRNAᵀʸʳ (G46–C54) in the V-loop deletion and chimera mutants, respectively. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. d Growth curves of E. coli cells expressing only PtuA–PtuB or co-expressing PtuA–PtuB along with either Ec-tRNATyr, SP-tRNATyr, or Ec-tRNAGly. Data represent the mean ± SD of three biological replicates (n = 3). To clarify how Retron-Eco7 detects phage infection, we infected E. coli cells containing Retron-Eco7 with SP15m and then isolated four escaper phages that evaded the Retron-Eco7 defense (Supplementary Fig. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that all four escaper phages contain point mutations in the gene encoding the D15 nuclease, which is essential for the expression of late genes in T5 phage genomes38 (Fig. Given that D15 exhibits endonuclease activity and that the escaper mutation (R86Q and R86L) is located near the active site in the D15–DNA complex structure39,40 (Supplementary Fig. First, we confirmed that the purified D15 protein cleaves both single- and double-stranded DNAs, but not single-stranded RNA, in vitro (Supplementary Fig. Next, we incubated the purified WT D15 or its mutants (R86L or R86Q) with the Retron-Eco7 complex and examined the cleavage of msDNA by urea-PAGE. In contrast, both mutants failed to efficiently cleave the msdDNA (Fig. Furthermore, the Retron-Eco7 complex treated with D15 yielded two distinct peaks corresponding to PtuA–PtuB and RT–msDNA on size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. To further explore D15's role in Retron-Eco7 activation, we measured the in vitro tRNA cleavage activities of the Retron-Eco7 complex with and without D15 treatment. Unexpectedly, the Retron-Eco7 complex did not efficiently cleave either Ec-tRNATyr or SP-tRNATyr, regardless of the D15 treatment, at least under our conditions (Fig. Consistently, in contrast to the expression of PtuA–PtuB, the co-expression of Retron-Eco7 and D15 did not induce cell dormancy in E. coli (Fig. Whereas the PtuA–PtuB nucleases from the Septu system35 and the Retron-Eco4 system (also known as Retron-Ec83 or Retron-Septu)41 degrade dsDNA and ssDNA, respectively, the Retron-Eco7 complex exhibited almost no DNA cleavage activity (Supplementary Fig. Collectively, our data indicate that D15 is necessary but not sufficient for Retron-Eco7 activation, suggesting that additional unknown factors are required for the activation. a Spot assays of the isolated escaper SP15m phages. E. coli cells harboring the Retron-Eco7 plasmid or an empty vector were infected with the SP15m phage or the four escaper phages. b In vitro msDNA cleavage by the D15 nuclease. The purified Retron-Eco7 complex was incubated with purified WT D15 or its mutants (R86L or R86Q) at 37 °C for 1, 5, and 30 min, and then analyzed by denaturing urea-PAGE. The nucleic acids were visualized with SYBR Gold. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. c Dissociation of PtuA–PtuB from the Retron-Eco7 complex by D15 treatment. The purified Retron-Eco7 complex was incubated with the purified D15 nuclease at 37 °C for 10 min, and then separated by size-exclusion chromatography. The peak fractions (indicated by a red line) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and denaturing urea-PAGE. The proteins and nucleic acids were visualized with CBB and SYBR Gold, respectively. Experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. d In vitro tRNA cleavage by the Retron-Eco7 complex. The 5′-Cy5-labeled Ec-tRNATyr (200 nM) was incubated with the purified Retron-Eco7 complex (500 nM) with or without the purified D15 (500 nM) at 37 °C for 60 min, and then analyzed by denaturing urea-PAGE. The nucleic acids (msrRNA and msdDNA) were visualized with SYBR Gold, while Ec-tRNATyr was detected using Cy5 fluorescence. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. e Spot assays of E. coli cells expressing Retron-Eco7 (with or without D15), D15, or PtuA–PtuB. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. f Proposed model of the Retron-Eco7 anti-phage defense. Our functional and structural data suggest that, in the Retron-Eco7 system, RT–msDNA binds to the PtuA–PtuB effector nuclease and inhibits the cleavage of the host tRNATyr by PtuA–PtuB, while PtuA–PtuB dissociates from RT–msDNA upon phage infection, leading to the host tRNATyr cleavage and thereby conferring anti-phage defense through abortive infection (Fig. Our findings reinforce the concept that, in retron systems, the RT–msDNA and effector proteins function as an anti-toxin and a toxin, respectively, thus protecting host bacterial cells. The Retron-Eco7 complex structure represents the second example of a structurally characterized retron complex, enabling structural comparisons between different retron complexes. Notable similarities and differences exist between the Retron-Eco7 complex and the recently reported Retron-Eco1 complex21,22,23 (Fig. The ncRNAs of Eco1 and Eco7 contain similar msrRNA sequences but differ in their msdRNA sequences (which serve as templates for reverse transcription). In the structures of Eco1 and Eco7, the msdRNA regions are reverse-transcribed by the RT into msdDNA, forming an msrRNA–msdDNA hybrid. In particular, the RT–msDNA complexes in the Eco1 and Eco7 systems adopt similar reverse-transcription termination states. In both structures, the msrRNA–msdDNA heteroduplex is accommodated within the RT active site, with the terminal nucleotide in the msdDNA defined by RT–msrRNA interactions in comparable manners. In contrast, the msdDNA nucleotides outside the heteroduplex adopt distinct structures and serve as scaffolds to recruit their cognate effector proteins, highlighting the common principle that the RT–msDNA binds its cognate effector to suppress the toxicity of the effector prior to phage infection. However, the binding modes of RT–msDNA to effectors differ substantially between the Eco1 and Eco7 structures (Fig. In the Eco7 structure, one RT–msDNA complex interacts with two effectors (PtuA–PtuB), primarily through msDNA–PtuA interactions. In contrast, in the Eco1 structure, one RT–msDNA complex associates with a single effector (N-glycosidase), forming a dimer primarily through effector–effector interactions. Furthermore, the Eco1 dimer interacts with another Eco1 dimer through RT–RT interactions, thereby forming a filament structure. Consistent with these structural differences, RT-Eco7 lacks the α helix corresponding to the N-terminal α helix in RT-Eco1, which is essential for Eco1 dimerization. a Structures of the RT–msDNA–PtuA–PtuB complex in Retron-Eco7 (left) and the RT–msDNA–N-glycosidase (N-glyco) complex in Retron-Eco1 (right)22 (PDB: 8QBM). ADP (Retron-Eco7) and ADP-ribose (Retron-Eco1) molecules are depicted as space-filling models. The structures are colored according to the protomers (upper) and domains (lower). Bound nucleotides, including three ADP molecules (Retron-Eco7), four ATP molecules (Septu), and two ADP molecules (Retron-Eco4), are shown as space-filling models. We identified the phage-encoded D15 nuclease as a trigger for the type I-A Retron-Eco7. Recently, George et al. reported that, in the type I-A retron system from E. coli FORC 82 (Retron-FORC), one RT–msDNA complex associates with two PtuA–PtuB effector nucleases to form a large complex similar to the Retron-Eco7 complex42. In addition, George et al. showed that the co-expression of the Retron-FORC system and D15 leads to msDNA degradation in E. coli, thereby inducing cell death42. These findings highlight the conserved role of D15 as a trigger protein among type I-A retrons. Subsequently, the effector enzyme hydrolyzes NAD(P)+ to produce a 5′-diphosphate ribose, potentially resulting in NAD(P)+ depletion and DNA ADP ribosylation, although the detailed mechanism remains unclear22,23. These observations reinforce the notion that msDNAs function as sensors of phage infection through diverse mechanisms. Recent studies showed that other retrons, such as Retron-Sen220 and Retron-Eco618, possess ncRNAs with distinct msdRNA sequences, utilize specific effectors with diverse activities, and detect different phage components, highlighting the structural and mechanistic variations among retron systems. However, there are notable differences in their action mechanisms. Second, Retron-Eco7 PtuA exhibits ATPase activity, whereas Septu PtuA lacks ATPase activity and functions as an ATP-binding protein, with the DNase activity of PtuA–PtuB inhibited by ATP binding. Third, the RNase activity of Retron-Eco7 PtuA–PtuB is triggered by D15-mediated msDNA cleavage, while the DNase activity of Septu PtuA–PtuB is enhanced by the reduced cellular ATP levels upon phage infection. A structural comparison of the PtuA–PtuB complexes from the Septu and Retron-Eco7 systems provides insights into their mechanistic differences (Fig. In both structures, the PtuA dimer binds to PtuB in a similar manner, but the PtuA–PtuB complexes adopt distinct oligomeric states. In the Retron-Eco7 structure, two PtuA dimers extensively interact with the msDNA, with their CC domains stabilizing the complex. In contrast, in the Septu structure, two PtuA dimers are bridged by a third PtuA dimer (lacking PtuB), without direct contacts between the first and second dimers. Consistent with these structural differences, Septu PtuA lacks a CC domain. However, it remains unclear why Retron-Eco7 PtuA–PtuB cleaves the host tRNA, while Septu PtuA–PtuB degrades the phage DNA, given that both PtuB nucleases adopt similar HNH folds. Unexpectedly, our data indicated that Retron-Eco7 cleaved tRNATyr in phage-infected E. coli cells, but not in vitro even after treatment with the D15 nuclease. Consistent with our findings, Wang et al. recently reported that Retron-Eco7 does not cleave tRNATyr in vitro, even after msDNA degradation by DNase I43. Wang et al. and Li et al. determined the cryo-EM structures of the Retron-Eco7 complex, comprising RT–msDNA, PtuA, and PtuB, which are essentially identical to our complex structure43,44. Furthermore, Wang et al. and Li et al. reported the cryo-EM structures of the RT–msDNA-unbound PtuA–PtuB complex in distinct stoichiometries (PtuA4–PtuB243 and PtuA2–PtuB144), demonstrating that PtuA and PtuB can form a complex after dissociation from RT–msDNA, although the stoichiometry of the functional complex remains unclear. To gain mechanistic insights into tRNATyr recognition by PtuA–PtuB, we used AlphaFold 345 to predict a structural model of the PtuA–PtuB complex bound to tRNATyr, based on the RT–msDNA-unbound PtuA4–PtuB2 structure. We obtained structural models of the tRNATyr-bound PtuA–PtuB complex, in which the active site of the PtuB nuclease is located near either the anticodon loop or the CCA end of tRNATyr (Supplementary Fig. A structural comparison of the Retron-Eco7 complex with the tRNA-bound PtuA–PtuB complex suggests that RT–msDNA prevents the tRNA substrate from accessing the PtuB active site, and that the dissociation of PtuA–PtuB from RT–msDNA allows for tRNA recognition. However, we did not obtain a model where the PtuB active site is located near the tRNATyr variable loop containing the cleavage site identified in our RNA-seq analysis. Thus, how tRNATyr is recognized and cleaved by the PtuA–PtuB complex remains unresolved. Notably, the co-expression of Retron-Eco7 and D15 did not induce bacterial growth arrest, suggesting that additional factors are necessary for the full activation of Retron-Eco7. It is possible that unknown factors further facilitate the dissociation of PtuB from the PtuA–PtuB complex, activating the PtuB nuclease. While our manuscript was under revision, Wang et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of the type I-A Retron-Eco4 complex, comprising one RT–msDNA complex and two PtuA–PtuB effector nucleases41. Although the Retron-Eco4 complex is structurally similar to the Retron-Eco7 complex, it cleaves ssDNA, rather than tRNATyr, underscoring the functional diversity within type I-A retrons (Fig. However, the mechanisms of Retron-Eco4 activation and specific substrate recognition by the two type I-A retron systems remain unknown. Recent studies reported that the PARIS defense system also targets host tRNA and protects bacterial cells against phage infection46,47,48, illuminating the mechanistic similarities between the Retron-Eco7 and PARIS systems. Furthermore, phage-encoded tRNAs can neutralize both systems, highlighting their biological role in countering bacterial defense systems, as described in recent studies25,49. However, there are notable mechanistic differences between the two systems. In the PARIS system, AriA (the ABC ATPase antitoxin) and AriB (the TOPRIM nuclease toxin) form a supramolecular complex, and the phage-encoded Ocr protein promotes the dissociation of AriB, which subsequently dimerizes and becomes activated to cleave the host tRNALys47,48. In summary, this study revealed that the Retron-Eco7 system cleaves the host tRNATyr during phage infection and provides anti-phage defense through abortive infection. However, further studies will be needed to understand its mechanism of action, and particularly how the Retron-Eco7 system becomes activated and cleaves tRNATyr. For the spot assay, 300 μL of an overnight culture of E. coli (DH10B) harboring the indicated plasmids (Supplementary Data 1) was mixed with 10 mL of LB top agar (LB medium, 0.5% agarose, and 1 mM CaCl2) and poured onto an LB agar plate. For the spot assays in Figs. 1b, c, 0.2% L-arabinose was added to the LB medium at the beginning of the culture to induce constitutive expression of Retron-Eco7. The phage solution was serially diluted tenfold in Sodium-Magnesium (SM) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgSO4, and 0.01% (w/v) gelatin solution). Then, 3 µL of each phage dilution was spotted onto the bacterial lawn. Plates were incubated at room temperature until the spots dried and then at 37 °C overnight. Lysis zones (plaques) were recorded the following day. E. coli cells containing the indicated plasmids (Supplementary Data 1) were grown at 37 °C overnight in LB medium. The overnight cultures were then diluted 100-fold in LB medium containing 0.1% L-arabinose and, if indicated, infected with phages at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI). A 100 µL aliquot of each diluted culture was transferred to a 96-well plate, which was sealed with a Breathe-Easy sealing membrane (Sigma Aldrich). Growth was monitored at 37 °C for 10 h with shaking, and OD600 values were measured every 20 min using a SpectraMax iD5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Raw data were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism 10. For the purification of the Retron-Eco7 complex, the gene encoding the ncRNA (144 nt) was amplified by PCR and cloned into a modified pACYCDuet-1 vector (Novagen) to construct pACYC-ncRNA (Supplementary Data 1). The operon encoding the RT (residues 1–311), PtuA (residues 1–550), and PtuB (residues 1–216) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pET28a vector to construct pET-His6-RT–PtuA–PtuB-Twin-strep (PtuB with a C-terminal Twin-strep tag) (Supplementary Data 1). The genes encoding D15 (residues 1–291) and PtuA were individually cloned into a modified pE-SUMO vector with an N-terminal His6-SUMO tag (LifeSensors). To prepare mutants, mutations were introduced using a PCR-based method, and the sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For the expression of the Retron-Eco7 complex (RT–ncRNA–PtuA–PtuB), E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) cells transformed with pACYC-ncRNA and pET-His6-RT–PtuA–PtuB-Twin-strep were cultured at 37 °C until the OD600 reached 0.8, and protein expression was then induced with 0.2 mM IPTG (Nacalai Tesque). The E. coli cells were further cultured at 18 °C overnight, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM PMSF), and lysed by sonication. The lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to Strep-Tactin XT 4 Flow high-capacity resin (IBA). The complex was purified on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (Cytiva), equilibrated with buffer C (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). To examine the stability of the Retron-Eco7 complex and its mutants, the complexes were purified by Strep-Tactin beads and then analyzed on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva), equilibrated with buffer C (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). The purified complex was stored at −80 °C until use, except for the cryo-EM analysis and tRNA cleavage assays, for which the freshly prepared complex was used without freezing. The protein concentration was measured using the Pierce 660-nm Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The synthetic tRNAs were purchased from Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma. For the expression of His6-SUMO tagged D15, E. coli Rosetta2 (DE3) (Novagen) cells were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium until the OD600 reached 0.8, and then induced with 0.2 mM IPTG and cultured overnight at 20 °C. The lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to Ni-NTA Superflow resin (QIAGEN) and eluted with buffer E (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, and 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). After treatment with SUMO protease (prepared in-house), the protein was further purified on a HiTrap Heparin column (Cytiva), equilibrated with buffer F (50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM TCEP). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15–2 M NaCl, and then further purified on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column, equilibrated with buffer G (50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). The purified protein was stored at −80 °C until use. His6-SUMO tagged PtuA was expressed in E. coli and purified using Ni-NTA resin, following the same protocol as for D15. The protein was treated with SUMO protease, and then loaded onto a HiTrap Heparin column, equilibrated with buffer H (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.3–2 M NaCl, and further purified on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva), equilibrated with buffer I (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). The purified protein was stored at −80 °C until use. The purified RT–msDNA–PtuA–PtuB complex (Retron-Eco7 complex) solution (5.0 mg/mL) was mixed with 0.25% (final concentration) CHAPSO (Nacalai Tesque). The mixture (3 μL) was immediately applied to freshly glow-discharged Au 300 mesh R1.2/1.3 grids (Quantifoil), using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI) at 4 °C, with a waiting time of 10 s and a blotting time of 6 s under 100% humidity conditions. The grids were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane cooled at liquid nitrogen temperature. Cryo-EM data were collected using a Titan Krios G3i microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific), running at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan Quantum-LS Energy Filter (GIF) and a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector in the correlated double sampling mode (The University of Tokyo, Japan). Movies were recorded at a nominal magnification of 105,000×, corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 0.83 Å, with an electron exposure of 7.74 e−/pix/sec for 4.60 s, resulting in an accumulated exposure of 49.7 e−/Å2. The data were automatically acquired by the image shift method using the EPU software (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with a defocus range of −0.8 to −2.0 μm, and 7847 movies were acquired. Data processing was performed using the cryoSPARC v4.6.2 software package50. Dose-fractionated movies were aligned using Patch motion correction, and the contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were approximated using Patch-Based CTF estimation with the default settings. Particles were automatically picked using Topaz Picker51. The picked particles were divided into five classes (states 1–5) by Heterogeneous Refinement with the default parameters, using the map derived from cryoSPARC Ab initio Reconstruction as the template. For states 1 and 2, masks were generated for the coiled-coil domain to further classify the conformational heterogeneity, and the selected particles after Heterogeneous Refinement were divided into three classes using 3D Classification without alignment. The best classes for states 1–5, containing 67,204, 125,237, 95,729, 93,471, and 180,392 particles, respectively, were refined using Non-uniform Refinement52 following Reference-Based Motion Correction. This refinement yielded maps with 2.75, 2.62, 2.70, 2.67, and 2.58-Å resolutions, respectively, according to the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion53. Local resolution was estimated using BlocRes in cryoSPARC54. The models of the Retron-Eco7 complex were automatically built using COOT55, starting from a model built by ModelAngelo56. The models were refined using Servalcat57 against unsharpened half maps, with structural restraints from AlphaFold 258 predictions processed by ProSMART59. The models were validated using MolProbity60. The statistics of the 3D reconstruction and model refinement are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The molecular graphics and cryo-EM density map figures were prepared using CueMol (http://www.cuemol.org) or UCSF ChimeraX61. ATPase activities were measured using an NADH-coupled assay, at 37 °C in a 384-well plate. Absorbance at 340 nm (A340) was measured every 1 min for 30 min using a SpectraMax iD5 plate reader (Molecular Devices) to monitor NADH oxidation coupled with ATP hydrolysis. Control reactions containing only 10 mM ATP (without protein) were used to correct for background NADH consumption from non-enzymatic ATP degradation. A340 values were converted to NADH concentrations using a calibration curve. ATPase activity (nmol ATP min−1 mg−1 protein) was calculated from the NADH oxidation rate (mM/min), determined from five data points between 15 and 20 min. Data were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism 10. E. coli (DH10B) cells containing the pBAD-PtuA–PtuB plasmid were grown in 10 mL of LB medium to an OD600 of 0.3. Expression of PtuA–PtuB was induced with 0.2% L-arabinose, and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking at 200 rpm. E. coli cells containing the empty pBAD vector (pKLC23) were used as the control. The cultures were then centrifuged at 6000 × g for 5 min, and the pellets were washed twice with PBS buffer. Total RNA was extracted using an miRNA isolation kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. For total RNA extraction from Retron-Eco7-expressing cells, E. coli cells containing the Retron-Eco7 plasmid or the empty vector (control) were infected with SP15 (MOI = 10) for 20 min. The cultures were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellets were washed twice with SM buffer. Total RNA was extracted using the miRNA isolation kit. The extracted RNA samples were used for tRNA-fragment sequencing. tRNA-fragment sequencing was performed by Filgen, Inc. and Arraystar Inc. (Project codes: J_041823-tRF&tiRNAseq-8 and J_102623-tRF&tiRNA-seq-8, respectively). Total RNA samples were initially assessed for integrity using agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA concentrations and protein contamination were measured using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and RNA quality was further evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). To ensure efficient library preparation, RNA samples were pretreated to remove specific modifications that could interfere with the process. These treatments included deacylation of 3′-aminoacyl RNA to 3′-OH, removal of 3′-cP (2′,3′-cyclic phosphate) to generate 3′-OH, phosphorylation of 5′-OH to 5′-P, and demethylation of m1A and m3C to facilitate efficient reverse transcription. Library preparation was performed using a NEBNext® Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina® (New England Biolabs). The workflow included 3′-adapter ligation, 5′-adapter ligation, cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification, and size selection of PCR products between 134 and 160 bp, corresponding to 14–40 nt small RNAs. The quality and quantity of the libraries were assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and equal amounts of each library were pooled based on quantification results. The pooled libraries were denatured with 0.1 M NaOH to produce single-stranded DNA molecules, diluted to a final concentration of 1.8 pM, and sequenced on an Illumina platform following the manufacturer's protocols. Sequencing quality was evaluated using FastQC. Adapter sequences were trimmed from raw reads using Cutadapt62. Processed reads were aligned to mature tRNA sequences, allowing for one mismatch. Reads that did not align to mature tRNAs were subsequently mapped to precursor tRNA sequences using Bowtie63. Unmapped reads were further aligned to miRNA reference sequences using miRDeep264. Expression profiles of tRNA-derived fragments were quantified based on the mapped read counts. E. coli (DH10B) cells containing either the empty vector, the Retron-Eco7 plasmid, or the Retron-Eco7 mutant plasmids were left uninfected or infected with the SP15 or SP15m phage for 20 min (MOI = 10). The cells were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 1 mL of RNA isolation reagent (40% (w/v) phenol, 1% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 2 M guanidine thiocyanate, 0.1% (w/v) 8-quinolinol, 20 mM tri-sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.1 M NaOAc, pH 4.5, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.2% (w/v) N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt, 50 mM salicylic acid, 10 mM aluminon, and 0.0001% (w/v) bromophenol blue). After vigorous shaking at 4 °C for 20 min, chloroform was added to the solution at a concentration of 20%. The mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the aqueous phase was collected. Total RNA was recovered from the aqueous phase by 2-propanol precipitation. Total RNA (4 μg) was resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea, stained with ethidium bromide, blotted onto a nylon membrane (Amersham Hybond N+; Cytiva), dried, and cross-linked by UV (254 nm, 120 mJ/cm2). The DNA probe for each tRNA (Supplementary Data 1) was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P] ATP (PerkinElmer) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo). The membrane was subjected to hybridization at 53 °C overnight in hybridization buffer (500 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 7.5% SDS, 5% polyethylene glycol 6000, 1 mM EDTA-NaOH, pH 8.0, and 0.5% casein) and 4 pmol of 5′-32P-radiolabeled DNA probe. The membrane was washed three times with SSC (150 mM NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0), dried, and exposed to an imaging plate (BAS-MS2040; Fujifilm) to visualize the hybridization bands, using an FLA-7000 imaging analyzer (Cytiva). Uncropped images are available in Source Data. E. coli cells carrying the Retron-Eco7 plasmid were infected with the SP15m phage (MOI = 1) and cultured overnight in 4 mL of LB medium at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Afterwards, the lysate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min and filtered through a 0.2 μm membrane. To screen for potential escaper phage, 100 μL of the filtered phage solution, containing both wild-type and escaper phages, was mixed with 100 μL of cultured E. coli carrying either the Retron-Eco7 plasmid or the empty vector. The mixture was combined with 4 mL of LB top agar and poured onto LB plates, and the plates were then incubated overnight at 37 °C. Single plaques formed on the Retron-Eco7-containing cells were identified as escaper mutants. To purify these escaper mutants, individual escaping plaques were propagated, and phage titers were subsequently determined using a plaque assay as described previously25. The purified escaper phages were then tested in plaque assays with E. coli cells containing either the Retron-Eco7 plasmid or the empty vector. High-titer phage lysates (> 107 PFU/mL) of the mutant phages were used for DNA extraction. The phage lysate (500 μL) was treated with DNase I (3 U/mL) and RNase A (20 ng/mL) (both from Takara), and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to degrade bacterial DNA and RNA. Phage DNA was then extracted using a Phage DNA Extraction Kit (Norgen Biotek Corp.) following the manufacturer's protocols. Whole-genome sequencing was performed by Macrogen Japan, Inc. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using CLC Genomic Workbench (QIAGEN), with silent mutations in protein-coding regions excluded from this analysis. The identified escaper phages are listed in Supplementary Data 1. To examine D15-mediated msDNA cleavage, the purified Retron-Eco7 complex (100 nM) was incubated with the purified WT D15 (100 nM) or its mutants (R86L and R86Q) (100 nM) at 37 °C for 1, 5, and 30 min, in 10 μL of reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT). To examine D15-mediated DNA and RNA cleavage, the purified WT D15 (100 nM) was incubated with either single-stranded DNA (200 nM), double-stranded DNA (200 nM), or single-stranded RNA (200 nM) at 37 °C for 10 min. The reactions were quenched with Proteinase K (Nacalai Tesque) in denaturing buffer containing 7 M urea, and analyzed by 15% urea-PAGE. The gels were stained with SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and then visualized using the FUSION Solo S imaging system (Vilber Bio Imaging). All experiments were performed at least three times. To investigate the dissociation of the Retron-Eco7 complex by D15 treatment, the purified Retron-Eco7 complex (210 nM) was incubated with the purified WT D15 (210 nM) at 37 °C for 10 min, in 400 μL of reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT). The reaction mixture was then fractionated on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and urea-PAGE. The gels were stained with Bullet CBB Stain One (Nacalai Tesque) and SYBR Gold, respectively, and then visualized using the FUSION Solo S imaging system. All experiments were performed at least three times. 5′-Cy5-labeled Ec-tRNATyr (200 nM) was incubated with the purified Retron-Eco7 complex (500 nM) with or without D15 (500 nM) at 37 °C for 60 min, in 10 μL of reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT). The reactions were quenched with Proteinase K in denaturing buffer containing 7 M urea, and then analyzed on 15% urea-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). All experiments were performed at least three times. E. coli (DH10B) cells, containing either the arabinose-inducible Retron-Eco7 (pKLC23-Eco7) or the arabinose-inducible PtuA and PtuB (pKLC23-PtuA–PtuB), along with the anhydrotetracycline-inducible D15 (pKLC83-D15) plasmid (Supplementary Data 1), were cultured overnight. The cultures were then serially diluted tenfold in LB medium. A 3 μL aliquot of each dilution was spotted onto LB agar plates. Expression of Retron-Eco7 or PtuA–PtuB, and D15 was induced by supplementing the plates with 0.2% L-arabinose and 50 ng/mL anhydrotetracycline, respectively. The empty pKLC23 and pKLC83 vectors were used as controls. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and colony growth was evaluated the following day. Sample sizes were determined based on those used in our previous studies and similar published work that yielded reproducible results. For cryo-EM analyses, particle images that did not improve map quality were excluded using standard classification procedures in cryoSPARC. All biochemical, cellular, and functional assays were conducted with independent replicates following widely accepted protocols in the field (three biological or technical replicates unless otherwise stated). Data are generally presented as the mean ± SD of three or four independent replicates (n  =  3 or 4), and no statistical analysis was performed. All experiments were independently repeated at least three times with similar results, confirming reproducibility. No randomization was performed for biochemical and cellular experiments because these assays involve inherently uniform and controllable samples, such as purified proteins or cell cultures, where variability is minimal compared with live animals. No blinding was performed for biochemical and cellular experiments, as these experiments involve objective measurements under controlled conditions that are not influenced by subjective assessments.

(2025)Cite this article Piperidine and pyridine are nitrogen heterocyclic motifs prominently used in pharmaceuticals and consequently of great importance. The direct reduction of planar pyridines into piperidines with high sp3-carbon content is highly attractive as this offers a route to producing high-value products and broadening the structural space. However, direct hydrogenation of pyridines with homogeneous catalysts is challenging due to their aromatic stability and catalyst-poisoning abilities. Here we describe a robust and selective iridium(III)-catalysed ionic hydrogenation of pyridines to corresponding functionalized piperidines. Important highly reduction-sensitive groups, including nitro, azido, bromo, alkenyl and alkynyl, are inert, enabling access to a broad range of multisubstituted piperidines in high yields, substantially expanding the available chemical space for this relevant scaffold. The method requires low catalyst loadings, is scalable to decagrams and delivers the most synthetically valuable free secondary amines as easily isolable and stable piperidinium salts. Applied in a complex late-stage setting, the pyridine motif in several FDA-approved drugs was successfully and selectively hydrogenated.

The man had stumbled on research by Grigson, suggesting that certain anti-obesity medications could help to reduce rats' addiction to drugs such as heroin and fentanyl. He decided to try quitting again, this time while taking semaglutide, the blockbuster GLP-1 drug better known as Ozempic. “That's when he wrote to me,” says Grigson, who works at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine in Hershey. Why do obesity drugs seem to treat so many other ailments? Why do obesity drugs seem to treat so many other ailments? Stories like this have been spreading fast in the past few years, through online forums, weight-loss clinics and news headlines. They describe people taking diabetes and weight-loss drugs such as semaglutide (also marketed as Wegovy) and tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro or Zepbound) who find themselves suddenly able to shake long-standing addictions to cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs. And now, clinical data are starting to back them up. More than a dozen randomized clinical studies testing GLP-1 drugs for addiction are now under way worldwide, with some results expected in the next few months. Neuroscientists, meanwhile, are working out how the weight-loss drugs suppress addiction by acting on hormone receptors in brain regions that control craving, reward and motivation. They are finding that GLP-1 therapies help to blunt urges for alcohol, opioids, nicotine and cocaine through some of the same brain pathways that also quell hunger cues and overeating. And some researchers are testing whether, by influencing reward-related brain circuits, the drugs might help with dementia and depression as well. The research is still in its early stages, scientists warn. “We first need to find out if it's efficacious and safe,” says W. Kyle Simmons, a neuroimaging specialist at Oklahoma State University in Tulsa, who is leading a GLP-1 trial for alcohol reduction. No truly new class of addiction medicine has won approval from regulators in decades, says Elisabet Jerlhag Holm, an addiction biologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. If GLP-1 drugs prove effective in bigger trials, she says, “it's a revolution”. It took some years for the current buzz around GLP-1 drugs in addiction medicine to build. Researchers originally developed them to control blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes by mimicking the hormone GLP-1. Soon it became clear that the drugs could curb appetite and promote weight loss, too. They act on hormone receptors located in the pancreas and gut — where they help to regulate blood sugar and signal fullness — but also in key regions of the brain that control reward and motivation, dialling down the urge for tasty, calorie-laden food. Her team also showed5 that GLP-1 therapy could reduce animal behaviours that resemble relapse, which is when people return to drugs after a period of abstinence. Some people report anecdotally that GLP-1 drugs are helping them to quit long-standing nicotine addictions.Credit: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Yet her findings barely registered among addiction researchers, she says, and pharmaceutical companies showed no interest either. “I was quite alone for a long time,” says Jerlhag Holm. But Lorenzo Leggio, a physician-scientist at the US National Institutes of Health in Baltimore, Maryland, noticed the work. He had also been following clues that GLP-1 might influence addictive behaviour and, in 2015, joined forces with Jerlhag Holm to uncover the first evidence of a connection between the hormone and alcohol dependence in humans. Using post-mortem human brain tissue, Leggio's lab later showed that people with alcohol-use disorder have elevated levels of GLP-1 receptors in key reward-related regions of the brain7. Leggio suspects that this reflects an adaptive response: alcohol dampens the body's GLP-1 production, and so the brain boosts expression of the hormone's receptors to preserve sensitivity to it in circuits that govern reward and motivation. These results, together with a growing number of animal studies, solidified GLP-1's connection to addictive behaviour. The Atlantic magazine published an article about people taking semaglutide who said their urge to smoke or drink had faded. “That was definitely a turning point,” says Leggio, who suddenly found himself getting calls from journalists. The first few rigorous trials, however, had largely disappointing results. A 2022 study in Denmark, led by psychiatrist Anders Fink-Jensen at the University of Copenhagen, found that weekly treatment with exenatide — a ‘first-generation' GLP-1 compound used since 2005 to treat diabetes but never approved for weight loss — did not substantially reduce the number of heavy drinking days in people diagnosed with alcohol dependence8. A 2023 trial in Switzerland likewise found that dulaglutide, another older GLP-1 drug, did not help people to quit smoking9. How obesity drugs quiet ‘food noise' in the brain How obesity drugs quiet ‘food noise' in the brain But other results suggested that the drugs might have an effect. In a trial10 involving 20 people with opioid-use disorder, led by Grigson and psychologist Scott Bunce, also at Pennsylvania State University, treatment with liraglutide — another first-generation GLP-1 drug — reduced opioid craving by roughly 40%. And when Fink-Jensen's team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at the brains of people taking exenatide in their clinical trial, they saw muted activity in reward-related regions when the participants viewed images of alcoholic drinks8. But the first-generation drugs tested in these preliminary studies are much less potent than agents such as semaglutide or tirzepatide. These second-generation compounds bind more tightly to the GLP-1 receptor, stay active in the body for longer and have shown greater benefits across a range of health conditions. So, could these latest drugs change the behaviour of people struggling with substance misuse? That's what researchers are now examining in a raft of clinical trials with hotly anticipated results. Fink-Jensen and his colleagues have already tested whether the high dose of semaglutide approved for weight loss can cut alcohol intake in 108 people with alcohol-use disorder and obesity, in a clinical trial that wrapped up earlier this year. He says the results should be published in early 2026. In the United States, meanwhile, Leggio and Simmons are each leading independent but coordinated randomized trials testing injected semaglutide in moderate-to-heavy drinkers who meet the diagnostic criteria for problematic alcohol use. Leggio's trial will involve 52 people and test the high-dose Wegovy form of the drug, whereas Simmons's trial, involving 80 people, is testing the lower-dose Ozempic, typically prescribed for diabetes. And psychologist Joseph Schacht at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora has been running his own alcohol trial with the oral version of semaglutide (marketed as Rybelsus). By coordinating their efforts, the three teams hope to tease apart how differences in dose and delivery affect outcomes. Schacht says that the pills, although less potent than injections, could be more appealing to people with alcohol addiction, many of whom also have a history of using injectable drugs such as fentanyl. “They can be gun-shy around needles, because that is a cue related to injection drug use,” he says. In all of these trials of semaglutide for alcohol dependence, the research teams are also using fMRI to capture before-and-after snapshots of the brain to show how the drug alters responses to alcohol-related prompts, such as drinks or photos. The imaging results might also show brain activity patterns that are more common in people who benefit from GLP-1 therapy than in those who don't. “It may give us a better understanding for whom the drug works best,” Simmons says. Researchers are already piecing together a picture of how GLP-1 drugs act on the brain's reward system. They know from animal models that rewarding substances — alcohol, nicotine, opioids, food — activate similar neural circuitry. This links deep brain structures such as the ventral tegmental area, where neurons that synthesize the neurotransmitter dopamine originate, to the nucleus accumbens, where dopamine signals arrive and register as pleasure. Normally, every sip, puff or hit sends a jolt of rewarding dopamine through this circuit, teaching the brain to want more and reinforcing addictive behaviour. GLP-1 receptors sit on neurons throughout this network and, when triggered, are thought to reduce the flow of dopamine and other chemical messages to make rewarding experiences feel less compelling. Stress responses come into play as well, animal studies show. When drugs activate GLP-1 receptors in brain regions such as the amygdala, they help to mute the surge of stress hormones that accompany anxiety, withdrawal and craving. This dual action — calming both the urge and the unease — could help to explain why the therapies seem to reduce not only consumption but also relapse, at least in rodents.

Nature Reviews Earth & Environment (2025)Cite this article The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) influences Southern Hemisphere temperature and precipitation, ocean circulation, carbon cycling and the Antarctic cryosphere. In this Review, we examine the dynamics, projections and effects of the SAM, focusing on future implications for the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. The SAM is the leading mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics, associated with variations in the mid-latitude westerly jet strength and position. The SAM is primarily an internally driven atmospheric process, for which anomalies dissipate in 1–2 weeks; however, sustained SAM anomalies can also be forced by stratospheric processes and tropical Pacific variability. Ozone depletion during the 1970s–1990s contributed to large positive trends in austral summer. The SAM is now in its most positive mean state in over 1,000 years, and a year-round positive trend in the SAM is projected to continue throughout the twenty-first century in response to increasing greenhouse gases. Given the importance of SAM effects on Southern Ocean circulation, carbon cycling, and Antarctic ice mass balance for future climate and sea level rise projections, it is crucial that the effects of SAM are better modelled and understood, including accounting for the influence of the shifting seasonality of positive SAM trends and its increasing asymmetry.

A climatological persistent low-pressure centre located in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean off the coast of West Antarctica, over the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas. A cold, dense water mass formed near Antarctica from dense shelf water that sinks and spreads along the ocean floor into the deepest parts of the global ocean; it has a key role in global meridional ocean circulation and climate regulation. A major eastwards-flowing ocean current that encircles Antarctica, connecting the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, thereby facilitating the global exchange of heat, freshwater and nutrients. A high-latitude westwards-flowing current on the edge of the Antarctic continental shelf that encircles most of the continent and forms a boundary between the open ocean and continental shelf waters, regulating the transport of water towards the continent. A band of strong winds blowing from the west to the east, encircling the mid-latitude to sub-Antarctic region in the stratosphere (~10–55 km altitudes), typically present from austral late autumn to late spring. Carbon within the atmospheric, oceanic or terrestrial realm that is of anthropogenic origin. The photosynthetic pigment contained in land plants and ocean phytoplankton, used here as a proxy for phytoplankton abundance and, approximately, ocean productivity. A water mass that upwells to the near surface of the polar and subpolar Southern Ocean, consisting of a blend of deep water masses from the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific ocean basins, with about half sourced from North Atlantic deep water. The internationally coordinated set of defined climate model experiments and shared model outputs from modelling groups around the world. A dense water mass formed on the Antarctic continental shelf through sea ice production whose temperature is therefore the local freezing temperature and its density is set by its salinity. The sum of bicarbonate (HCO3−) and carbonate (CO32) ions, plus aqueous CO2 (CO2(aq)), also referred to as carbonic acid, H2CO3. A transient disturbance that deviates from the mean flow in the atmosphere or ocean (includes cyclones and anticyclones in the atmosphere). The net transfer of zonal momentum from atmospheric eddies into the mean flow, resulting in westerly acceleration of the zonal-mean flow caused by the propagation of waves away from their source region. The net removal of zonal momentum from the mean flow by atmospheric eddies, corresponding to deceleration of the zonal-mean flow due to breaking waves. Also termed Ekman drift; a wind-driven flow of water in the upper surface layer of the ocean resulting from a combination of wind drag and the Coriolis effect, which deflects the flow to the left of the wind in the Southern Hemisphere, and to the right of the wind in the Northern Hemisphere. A naturally occurring fluctuation in sea surface temperatures coupled with winds and pressure across the tropical Pacific Ocean, associated with sustained warming (El Niño) or cooling (La Niña) in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, typically occurring every 2–7 years. The mid-latitude component of the extratropical mean meridional circulation, consisting of poleward flow near the surface, upwards motion near the mid-latitude jet, equatorward flow aloft and subsidence in the subtropics. Also termed Hadley cell; the thermally driven mean meridional circulation characterized by rising warm, moist air in the tropics; poleward motion aloft; sinking cooler, drier air in the subtropics; and equatorward flow at the surface, transporting energy, momentum and moisture between these regions. A naturally occurring decadal-to-multidecadal fluctuation of Pacific sea surface temperatures, coupled with atmospheric circulation, with a spatial pattern resembling ENSO but extending into the extratropical Pacific. A pulse of tropical convective activity (cloud and rainfall) that propagates eastwards near the equator, from the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific Ocean, with a cycle repeating approximately every 30–60 days. A band of strong westerly winds extending from the surface to the upper troposphere in the mid-to-high latitudes of both hemispheres, driven by eddy momentum flux convergence. Unlike the subtropical jet, the mid-latitude eddy-driven jet arises from the cumulative effect of eddies rather than a coherent flow. Carbon within the atmosphere, oceanic or terrestrial realm that has not been affected by anthropogenic emissions of carbon, considered equivalent to pre-industrial carbon. The balance of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions with equivalent uptake of carbon from the atmosphere through anthropogenic activities (sometimes net-zero emissions are used to refer to all greenhouse gases rather than just carbon dioxide). A Rossby wave train that extends from the central Pacific Ocean to the Amundsen and Weddell seas, manifesting across intraseasonal to decadal timescales. Large-scale (planetary) or synoptic-scale waves in the atmosphere that arise from the variation of the Coriolis effect with latitude. A band of strong westerly winds located in the upper troposphere of the subtropics on the poleward side of the Hadley cell of both hemispheres, peaking in winter. The net effect of ice sheet mass gain due to precipitation, and mass loss primarily by temperature-driven surface melt.
