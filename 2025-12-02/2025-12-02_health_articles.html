                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study analyzing dozens of published papers over five decades focusing on health care disparities in Washington, DC, found that those that employed medical humanities approaches identified crucial barriers and opportunities for intervention that quantitative studies often miss. Lead author Sweta Ghatti, a fourth year student at Georgetown School of Medicine, began the study as part of a Mitchell Summer Research Scholarship project addressing health challenges in the District. Ghatti worked closely with senior author Lakshmi Krishnan, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine and director of the Georgetown Medical Humanities, on the project for almost two years. "We know that people living in the District face multiple challenges in accessing health care and that some segments of the population have significantly poorer health profiles," Ghatti said. "For example, predominantly Black areas of the District experience higher rates of chronic diseases such as asthma, hypertension, diabetes and poor maternal health outcomes than White neighborhoods. Our goal was to systematically map the literature of health disparity in DC and to examine the strengths and weaknesses of these methodologies in understanding barriers to care and potentially opportunities for intervention." Medical humanities is a dynamic, interdisciplinary field that explores the ethical, historical, literary, philosophical and religious dimensions of health and illness. Medical humanities includes history of medicine, narrative medicine and other storytelling approaches, social sciences, communications and the use of the arts to identify issues that are important to patients, caregivers and providers. Ghatti began by analyzing over 1500 papers, using strict criteria to narrow down the final 119 included for analysis. Of those, 51 were tagged as medical humanities papers. The analysis revealed that the medical humanities papers were significantly more likely to identify systemic information gaps (78.4% vs. 30.9% p<0.001) and stigma-related barriers (27.5% vs. 5.p% p=0.002) compared to more quantitative scientific papers. Medical humanities really bring a contextual approach to understanding how individuals and communities experience health care. "In these studies, we are looking at both specific factors and the enduring things that connect us," said Krishnan, who is also co-executive director of the Georgetown Howard Center for Medical Humanities and Health Justice. "We see these qualitative and quantitative studies as complementary, providing different lenses and more texture without breaking the health care experience into components." "We find that quantitative studies don't provide a complete picture of disparities," says Ghatti. "In the medical humanities studies, we hear about issues like language barriers, stigma, mistrust of the health care system and lack of communication that makes navigating the health care system difficult for some patients." Ghatti says the findings can have a direct impact on medical and public health education, medical practice and research. "In this country, where health care disparities have persisted over the five decades we studied, the stakes are too high to rely on a single lens or intervention." In addition to Ghatti, Krishnan and King, authors include Scott Dorris and Xue Geng, both of Georgetown University Medical Center.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this interview, News Medical speaks with Rhea Stringer, Electron Microscopist at the John Innes Centre, about the role of electron microscopy in biological imaging. Rhea discusses how advanced sample preparation technologies and a growing demand for volume electron microscopy are shaping new possibilities in plant and microbial research. My name is Rhea Stringer, and I work at the John Innes Centre in Norwich. I'm part of the bioimaging platform specializing in electron microscopy. My background is in volume electron microscopy, which I helped establish here through an Institutional Development Grant. That's still my focus, but my role has expanded over time to cover a broad range of EM techniques. Our lab supports various research projects, primarily in plant and microbial science. My work often involves preparing samples and optimizing imaging workflows - particularly for volume electron microscopy, which is increasingly in demand. It's a niche area, particularly within plant science, so it's exciting to be at the forefront of that development. I'd say the biggest challenge, which I actually find quite exciting, is dealing with new or unfamiliar sample types. Sometimes researchers come to us with a question or a biological structure we haven't imaged before, and that means we need to develop new protocols. It can be challenging, but I enjoy the problem-solving aspect. We use a lot of Leica equipment for sample preparation in electron microscopy. The EM CPD300 for critical point drying samples. Alternatively, for cryo-fixation, we have the EM ICE and the EM AFS2 for progressive low-temperature embedding or freeze-substitution. We also use the EM ACE600, which has a sputter coater and e-beam. For glow discharging and carbon coating, we use the EM ACE200. Plant cells are notoriously difficult to prepare conventionally, as chemical fixatives often struggle to penetrate the thick cell walls, and large vacuoles can swell and rupture upon dehydration, leading to severe structural artifacts. Following freezing, the EM AFS2 allows for gentle, automated processing to replace the vitreous water with embedding resin at extremely low temperatures. This integrated, artifact-free approach is essential for obtaining quality data on plant development, cell signalling, and biotic/abiotic stress responses. Honestly, it's been a really positive experience. The equipment is reliable, easy to use, and fits well into our workflows. But what really stood out was the support we've received from Leica. The engineers are approachable, knowledgeable, and genuinely helpful. They've provided excellent hands-on training, which makes a huge difference when adopting new techniques or troubleshooting issues. I'd say just go for it - and if you're unsure about anything, ask questions. Everyone I've dealt with at Leica has been friendly, honest, and helpful. They don't push you to buy something that's not right for your lab. Instead, they really focus on finding the best solution for your needs, and that kind of support is invaluable. Volume electron microscopy is still evolving, especially in plant science, my main area. It's exciting because there's so much to explore - new samples, organisms, and datasets. I'm looking forward to developing new techniques and seeing where it all goes. Rhea Stringer is an Electron Microscopist at the John Innes Centre, one of the UK's leading plant and microbial science research institutes. She plays a key role in the Centre's bioimaging platform, supporting both internal and external researchers in their use of electron microscopy. Rhea's focus lies in volume electron microscopy - a field that continues to evolve and expand, particularly within plant science. Her work involves advanced sample preparation, imaging workflows, and technique development using state-of-the-art Leica instrumentation. Rhea earned her undergraduate degree in Animal Sciences from Canterbury Christ Church University. Following her studies, she began her career as an animal technician and later became involved in using an ultramicrotome for sectioning wax-embedded brains for imaging. Through her work in microscopy services, Rhea contributes to a broad range of scientific studies that rely on high-resolution imaging to uncover the cellular architecture of plant and microbial samples. She is passionate about training others, refining EM protocols, and pushing the limits of what can be visualized through electron microscopy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disease characterized by fibrosis and bile duct stricturing, which ultimately leads to cirrhosis and liver failure. PSC is strongly associated with both types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), namely, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. However, the patient population in Asia is relatively small, and no large-scale studies have previously examined the prevalence and clinical course of PSC in this region. To address this gap, the research team conducted a multinational collaborative study across six Asian countries. In this study, 25 institutions from Japan, Korea, China (including Hong Kong), Taiwan, Malaysia, and India analyzed data from approximately 51,000 patients with IBD. The analysis revealed that the prevalence of PSC among patients with IBD in Asian centers is markedly lower than in Western countries, with a tendency toward more favorable clinical outcomes. Furthermore, patients presenting with symptoms such as jaundice or hypoalbuminemia-indicative of impaired liver function-at the time of PSC diagnosis required liver transplantation sooner. However, the proportion of "asymptomatic PSC" at diagnosis has increased in recent years. These patients demonstrated preserved liver function, remaining stable for a prolonged time without needing a liver transplantation. This trend may be attributable to the widespread use of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, a noninvasive imaging modality that enables early-stage detection of PSC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Victims of intimate partner violence with suicidal behavior have characteristic injury patterns on medical imaging, according to a new study being presented today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). It is an increasingly recognized risk factor for suicidal behavior, and victims of intimate partner violence with suicidal behavior often end up at the hospital years before those without. Patients reporting intimate partner violence are at significantly increased risk of suicidal behavior. As suicide remains a leading cause of death worldwide, our evidence of distinct and overlapping injury patterns with intimate partner violence is an important step towards improving detection and providing timely intervention." Emily Y. Yang, B.S., study co-author, 4th-year medical student at Harvard Medical School, Boston and research trainee at the Trauma Imaging Research and Innovation Center (TIRIC), BWH Suicidal behavior occurred at a higher frequency among patients reporting intimate partner violence (16.7%) versus patients without a history of intimate partner violence (2.5%). Patients with suicidal behavior and history of intimate partner violence were more likely than other patients to present to the hospital during the night versus day and in the ER, versus non-ER settings. Review of reports by two experienced emergency radiologists revealed that both intimate partner violence and suicidal behavior played independent roles in doubling the overall injury rate compared to that of patients without a history of intimate partner violence or suicidal behavior. Patients with intimate partner violence often sustained head, face, neck and upper limb injuries-areas commonly hurt during assaults. When looking at independent effects of intimate partner violence versus suicidal behavior, the researchers found that suicidal behavior had a greater impact on the injury rate of upper extremity injuries, while intimate partner violence had a greater impact on head/face/neck injuries. Increased awareness of the interaction between intimate partner violence, suicidal behavior and radiologic injury patterns can better protect these vulnerable populations, according to Yang. "Patients with a history of intimate partner violence tend to hide their circumstances out of fear, stigma, and/or distrust in the medical system," she said. "Radiologists are possibly the only providers in a patient's healthcare experience who can identify subtle injuries and patterns that may otherwise go unnoticed, giving voice to an often-voiceless population." Radiologists have a unique opportunity to uncover the hidden concerns behind injuries, according to MGH/BWH radiologist Bharti Khurana, M.D., M.B.A., associate professor at Harvard Medical School, founding director of TIRIC and principal investigator and senior author of the study. "By recognizing recurring imaging patterns in patients experiencing intimate partner violence, especially those exhibiting suicidal behavior, we can initiate critical interventions earlier and potentially save lives," Dr. Khurana said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The CMS decision on October 28 covers two renal denervation devices, Recor's Paradise ultrasound system and Medtronic's Symplicity Spyral radiofrequency system, which were approved by the FDA in 2023. The decision was made under the Coverage with Evidence Development process, meaning procedures will only be covered if they are performed as part of a CMS-approved study. Renal denervation is a minimally invasive catheter-based therapy for patients with uncontrolled hypertension whose blood pressure is not adequately managed with lifestyle changes and medication. Jiandong Zhang, MD, a cardiologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, said he hopes the CMS approval will increase uptake of the procedure for those who need it. But I also want to be cautious about it,” Zhang said. “This is not a procedure for everybody with high blood pressure. Patients need to understand that the procedure is not a cure and that they will still need to continue taking their medications, he said. And private insurers tend to follow the agency's lead on which procedures should be eligible for reimbursement, he noted. “There were about 50 companies in this space, and all but twofolded,” Fisher said. But that one null result has had a lasting impact. “Many providers still think the field is dead because there was so much negativity around it,” Fisher said. The CMS decision should help to alleviate some of those concerns, she added. “Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for death around the world, but awareness and control have taken a back seat for decades,” she said. “This is a transformative milestone for patients across the US who continue to battle uncontrolled hypertension,” Lara Barghout, CEO of Recor Medical, said in a news release. “CMS is paving the way for broader, more equitable access to this breakthrough therapy.” “This milestone enables physicians to offer patients more choices when managing hypertension, potentially leading to better outcomes for a population in urgent need of new options,” Jason Weidman, president of Medtronic's Coronary & Renal Denervation business, said in a news release.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Working out of a tribal-owned hospital in Anchorage, Alaska, liver specialist Brian McMahon has spent decades treating the long shadow of hepatitis B. Before a vaccine became available in the 1980s, he saw the virus claim young lives in western Alaskan communities with stunning speed. One of his patients was 17 years old when he first examined her for stomach pain. McMahon discovered she had developed liver cancer caused by hepatitis B, just weeks before she was set to graduate from high school as valedictorian. McMahon thinks often of an 8-year-old boy who showed no signs of illness until he complained of pain from what turned out to be a rapidly growing tumor on his liver. The boy died at home a week later. The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids, even in microscopic amounts, and the virus can survive on surfaces for a week. Like many of his patients, McMahon said, both children contracted hepatitis B at birth or in early childhood. A birth dose of the vaccine, recommended for newborns since 1991, is up to 90% effective in preventing infection from the mother if given in the first 24 hours of life. If babies receive all three doses, 98% of them have immunity from the incurable virus, with the protection lasting at least 30 years. "Liver cancer has disappeared in children," McMahon said. He worries those hard-won gains could soon be rolled back. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to discuss and vote on the hepatitis B birth dose recommendation during its two-day meeting starting Dec. 4, potentially limiting children's access. On Tucker Carlson's podcast in June, Kennedy falsely claimed that the hepatitis B birth dose is a "likely culprit" of autism. He also said the hepatitis B virus is not "casually contagious." But decades of research shows the virus can be transmitted through indirect contact, when traces of infected fluids like blood enter the body when people share personal items like razors or toothbrushes. Most private insurers must cover the vaccines the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices endorses, and many state vaccination policies are directly linked to its guidelines. But keeping the recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine at birth preserves the widest range of options for families. They can choose to vaccinate at birth, wait until later in childhood, or not vaccinate at all, and insurance will continue to cover the cost of the shot as long as it remains approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Two senior FDA officials — Commissioner Marty Makary and top vaccine regulator Vinay Prasad — suggested at the end of November that changes to the vaccine approval process may be coming. It's not clear whether he was referring to combination vaccines that offer immunity against multiple diseases with a single shot. "Whatever comes out of this disaster of a meeting in December is going to be mainly designed around sowing distrust and spreading fear," he said. President Donald Trump, Kennedy, and some newly appointed ACIP members have mischaracterized how the liver disease spreads, ignoring or downplaying the risk of transmission through indirect contact. The hepatitis B virus is far more infectious than HIV. Unvaccinated people, including children, can get infected from microscopic amounts of blood on a tabletop or toy, even when the infected person is asymptomatic. McMahon has cared for children who tested negative at birth and later became infected through indirect contact. In a study in the 1970s, nearly a third of such children went on to develop chronic hepatitis B without ever showing symptoms, he said. The CDC recommends that all pregnant people be screened for hepatitis B, but it estimates that up to 16% are not tested and fall through the cracks. O'Leary and other experts say testing mothers for the virus shortly before or after delivery is unfeasible, because most hospitals lack the staff and resources. The three-dose vaccine has a long track record of safety. Numerous studies show it is not associated with an increased risk of infant death, fever or sepsis, multiple sclerosis, or autoimmune conditions, and severe reactions are rare. "We have an incredible safety profile," O'Leary said. "No one expects to get in a car wreck, right? And yet we all put our seat belts on. The CDC estimates that 2.4 million people in the U.S. have hepatitis B and that half do not know they are infected. The disease can range from an acute infection to a chronic one, often with few to no symptoms. If the disease is left untreated, it can lead to serious conditions such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP, said some parents struggle to understand why a healthy newborn needs a vaccine so soon after birth, especially for a virus they feel certain they don't have and often wrongly associate only with risky behaviors. Those perceptions, he said, mix with declining trust in public health and rising skepticism about vaccines. Babies who receive the full vaccine series starting from birth have their chance of liver cancer reduced by 84%. "If you wait a month and if the mom happens to be positive, or the baby picks it up from a caregiver, by that time the infection is established in that baby's liver," Schaffner said. He said that if fewer people get vaccinated, hepatitis B will circulate at higher rates in American communities and the risk of contracting the virus will rise for everyone who doesn't get the shots. For patients who require a liver transplant, annual medical expenses can climb above $320,000, depending on their treatment. Over the past 30 years, the main adverse events parents have reported from their babies receiving the birth dose have been fussiness and crying, both of which pass quickly. "The data are so clear about this," Schaffner said. "A whole array now of other countries have initiated this program.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bedfont® Scientific Limited, world leaders in breath analysis, with over 48 years of experience in designing and manufacturing medical breath analysis devices, has collaborated with Rbeck Healtech Private to make Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) testing more accessible in India. Rbeck Healthtech Private is an entirely diverse healthcare equipment distributor, with a portfolio specializing in pulmonology, cardiology, and rehabilitation. It has recently added the innovative NObreath® device to its offerings, expanding access to FeNO testing in India. Asthma is a chronic lung disease which cannot be cured; however, with the correct diagnosis and treatment, people with asthma can lead normal lives. India accounts for approximately 13.1 % of the global asthma burden, meaning that improving access to essential diagnostic and management tools, such as the NObreath®, is vital. The NObreath® measures FeNO levels on exhaled breath, a key indicator in type 2 airway inflammation, which is commonly found in asthma. Partnering with Rbeck Healthtech and the successful registration for the NObreath® in India is a meaningful milestone in our mission to make precision asthma care accessible worldwide. India faces a significant burden of asthma, and we believe that FeNO testing can empower clinicians with clearer insights into airway inflammation, leading to more personalized and effective treatment decisions. With the Global Asthma Report 2022 indicating that a considerable proportion of asthmatic individuals remain underdiagnosed or untreated in India, it is hoped that this strategic partnership will help expand the accessibility of FeNO testing in the region, ultimately saving lives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study led by McMaster University researchers shows that a widely available and inexpensive medication not only prevents potentially serious stomach bleeding in critically ill patients, but also saves hospitals thousands of dollars. These patients on life support are at high risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, a complication caused by stress-induced ulcers in the stomach that can prolong hospital stays and increase costs. In an era of rising health-care costs, interventions that are both clinically effective and cost-saving are rare. Feng Xie, Professor, Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact, McMaster University Until now, the economic impact of prescribing pantoprazole each day for patients on breathing machines had been unclear. The researchers conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using international data from the REVISE trial, comparing outcomes and resource use between patients who received pantoprazole daily and those who did not. The results have significant implications for critical care practitioners, pharmacy departments, and policymakers. "Pantoprazole costs between 50 cents and two dollars per dose across the country, yet our analysis showed how prescribing it to invasively ventilated patients can save healthcare resources by reducing bleeding events and reducing length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital," said senior author Deborah Cook, a professor in the Department of Medicine at McMaster. "In the expensive, high-technology ICU setting, this is a simple, low-cost intervention that improves outcomes and reduces health-care costs," adds Cook, a critical care physician practising at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton. This economic evaluation, E-REVISE, was funded by grants from the Hamilton Academic Health Sciences Organization and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research. The REVISE Trial was funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, the Accelerating Clinical Trials Fund, Physicians Services Incorporated of Ontario, Hamilton Association of Health Sciences Organization, and the National Health Medical Research Council of Australia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What's more, these stem cells respond to environmental light. When imagining creatures with complex eyes, most people think of mammals, birds, or maybe octopuses. Yet annelid worms from the sea – such as the bristleworm Platynereis dumerilii – also have eyes structured much like those of vertebrates and cephalopods, known as "camera-type" eyes, and some of them are capable of surprisingly high-resolution vision. But how do these invertebrate eyes continue to grow throughout adult life? An international research team from the University of Vienna, the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, and the University of Oldenburg has now taken a closer look at this question – and obtained intriguing new insights. Camera-type eyes in invertebrates and vertebrates are textbook examples of parallel evolution, thought to have arisen independently as similar solutions to the same biological challenge. To explore how such eyes continue to develop, the team examined adult eyes of Platynereis – a model system long used to study fundamental principles of photoreceptor function and brain evolution. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, first author Nadja Milivojev from the Department of Neurosciences and Developmental Biology, University of Vienna, identified molecular markers characteristic of stem cells and mapped where these cells are located and active in the worm's retina. It was remarkable to find dividing cells at the edge of the worm's retina – the same place where some groups of vertebrates maintain their retinal stem cells for life-long eye growth." Indeed, this so-called "ciliary marginal zone" is thought to support continuous eye growth - a pattern now mirrored in the bristleworm retina. "In vertebrate examples of life-long growth as fishes and amphibians – such stem cells supply the eye with fresh retinal neurons while the animal develops," explains senior author Florian Raible, University of Vienna, whose lab has a long-standing track record in research on stem cell biology. "Remarkably, Nadja's work showed that bristleworm eyes can also add new photoreceptor cells and expand their size – a trait that has not been well studied outside the vertebrate lineage", Raible adds. Even more fascinating, the research team discovered that eye growth in adult worms is also regulated by light in their environment. Through detailed genetic and molecular analyses, they showed that this effect is mediated by a c-opsin, a light-sensitive molecule, also present in the rod and cone cells of vertebrate retinas. While previous studies had shown that worm eyes rely on a different family of opsin molecules, the new findings on the presence of a vertebrate-type c-opsin came as a major surprise. Milivojev and colleagues discovered that this light-sensitive molecule is present in early precursors of the worm's photoreceptor cells, suggesting that it acts as a molecular switch linking environmental light to stem cell activity. The discovery highlights that visual systems not only sense light, but that their development can be regulated by light as well. The discovery that Platynereis eyes rely on a ring of neural stem cells brings biologists closer to understanding universal principles behind sensory organ evolution. Could other neural stem cells in the body also respond to environmental light? And how might artificial illumination disrupt such natural regulatory systems?
