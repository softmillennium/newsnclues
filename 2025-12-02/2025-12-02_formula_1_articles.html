                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory 2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Bearman furious after botched Haas pit stop Red Bull have stated that comments made about Kimi Antonelli in Qatar were "clearly incorrect", after the Mercedes rookie faced abuse online. Red Bull have said they "sincerely regret" the online abuse directed towards Kimi Antonelli following "clearly incorrect" comments suggesting the Mercedes rookie allowed title contender Lando Norris past in the Qatar Grand Prix. With Max Verstappen on course to win at the Lusail International Circuit, Antonelli found himself running ahead of Norris in the closing stages of the race, thanks to a tyre strategy that had seen Mercedes pit both cars under the early Safety Car. But with just two laps to go, Antonelli ran deep into a corner and that gave Norris the opportunity he needed to grab P4 and two extra vital points as he looks to secure his maiden title in Abu Dhabi next weekend. Gianpiero Lambiase, Verstappen's race engineer, told the reigning champion over the radio: “Not sure what happened to Antonelli Max, looks like he just pulled over and let Norris through.” However, Lambiase was quick to apologise to Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff for the comment, conceding he had not seen the situation fully. On Monday Red Bull released a statement that read: “Comments made before the end of, and immediately after, the Qatar GP suggesting that Mercedes driver Kimi Antonelli had deliberately allowed Lando Norris to overtake him are clearly incorrect. "Replay footage shows Antonelli momentarily losing control of his car, thus allowing Norris to pass him. We sincerely regret that this has led to Antonelli receiving online abuse.” "Kimi is fighting for a potential P3 [in the race]. I'm annoyed with other mistakes and then hearing such nonsense blows my mind. “[Antonelli] had a bit of a moment in the previous corner and then less entry speed into that left-hander, put the gas down and at that moment, which can happen, that lost the position. Russell had dropped places at the start, while Antonelli lost out to Sainz – and also on a potential podium – in the first round of pit stops. “We had a fast car in the Sprint, and I think we had a fast car today," Wolff added. "When you lose positions on the pit stop and you make mistakes in the race, obviously that's not going to help. Mercedes are 33 points ahead of Red Bull in the championship, as they look to secure P2 behind McLaren. And while that is some consolation from the final season of the current regulations, Wolff admitted it was a far cry from what he and the team expected of themselves. You look at the stats, and you say, well, that's a team that has fought on the front. If we are being totally honest with ourselves, then you need to say that there wasn't a single year [of the regulations] we were really fighting for a World Championship.</p>
