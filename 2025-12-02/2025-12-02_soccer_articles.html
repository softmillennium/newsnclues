                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Hinchliffe is Fortune's Most Powerful Women editor, overseeing editorial for the longstanding franchise. As a senior writer at Fortune, Emma has covered women in business and gender-lens news across business, politics, and culture. She owns the Washington Spirit, the London City Lionesses, OL Lyonnes, and in 2024 launched Kynisca, a women's sports organization to power it all. Now, Fortune is the first to report, she's launching the Kang Women's Institute, an organization within U.S. Soccer's Soccer Forward foundation. It promises to research the needs of female athletes, from their specific requirements for injury recovery and reentry after pregnancy to best practices for coaching girls in youth sports. Kang started this work through her own organization; after buying three clubs, she noticed problems compared to men's sports. Why don't we have enough female coaches and referees?” she was asking after entering the space with the capital she earned from selling her health care IT company. Earlier this year, she merged Kynisca's innovation hub with U.S. Soccer in the hopes that the federation's brand-name convening power would get researchers and study participants on board faster. In total, she's committed $55 million to this work, $25 million for the new institute with projects already in the works with UNC and Duke and $30 million for specific programs for youth sports and coaching. Only 6% of global sports science research globally focuses on women. In sports, women have been treated as “small men,” she says. Emma Hayes, coach of the U.S. Women's National Team and former manager of Chelsea Women where she won seven titles, served as a key adviser on this effort. Hayes realized the detrimental effects that treating women athletes the same as men could have about a decade ago, when three of her players at Chelsea had ACL injuries in one year. More recently, the U.S. Women's National Team has had multiple players become pregnant and give birth. She wants to not just support players when they return to play, but help them throughout their pregnancies—like understanding when and how to train, and accounting for that player's specific experience of pregnancy. When they do come back, their return to play plan should take into account whether they had a vaginal birth or a C-section. The Kang Institute plans to tackle all of this. At Kang's clubs, players wear Oura rings to track their health data and train based on those insights. Kang started getting involved in women's sports almost four years ago. Research shows that girls often drop out of sports around age 12—just as they're entering puberty and dealing with body confidence issues. Youth sports coaches should be trained how to handle the sensitive time in girls' lives, Hayes says. “It's not as simple as just going to the field with an extra tampon and a sanitary towel, though that would be helpful,” she says. “Everything from ensuring we don't wear white shorts to what are the best ways for having challenging conversations in what is a really tricky period for young girls? How might we support when body images plays such an important part of their own self-confidence?” For Kang, the work in youth sports achieves a social mission and future proofs her own clubs and sport for the decades ahead. Girls' soccer programs in the U.S. have less infrastructure and support compared to Europe, and American clubs are fighting to keep players like the Washington Spirit's Trinity Rodman in the U.S., where salary caps limit how much stars can earn. “We have to make sure that we invest in really showing the clear path,” she says, “so that young girls can aspire to be the next Alex Morgan, the next Trinity Rodman.” FORTUNE may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new simulation of the 2026 FIFA World Cup group stage draw handed the U.S. men's national team an immediate challenge, while the other two host nations, Mexico and Canada, could also be in for difficult games. And a new mock draw conducted by Sports Illustrated has handed Mauricio Pochettino and his USMNT side a difficult, yet manageable route through to the knockout stages. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. The U.S. is joined by Croatia, Tunisia and New Zealand in Group D. Led by Luka Modrić, Croatia would represent a difficult challenge early in the tournament. Pochettino and his men would likely fancy their chances of at least finishing second if they draw Tunisia and New Zealand. The Croatia game would probably determine who tops Group D. Host nation Mexico is drawn against Colombia, Scotland and Jordan—a difficult group that threatens El Tri's chances of advancing to the bracket. Colombia will be led by Bayern Munich star Luis Díaz, hoping to go one step further than a runner-up finish in the 2024 Copa América. Scotland features established talents like Andy Robertson, Scott McTominay and Kieran Tierney. A draw could bring their tournament to an early end. Morocco looks to improve on their fourth place finish from 2022, while Saudi Arabia notably pulled off the upset of that tournament beating Argentina in the group stage. If it's Italy, Canada could be eliminated from the group stage. The reigning World Cup champions would, barring some catastrophic occurrence, be heavily favored to top this group. Given Argentina wouldn't meet Spain, the other tournament favorite, until the final based on the group stage draw rules, Lionel Messi could be primed for a Hollywood ending to his international career. He might not need to win it, at least in his mind, but adding the most prestigious international honor to his cabinet would certainly reignite the greatest of all time debate. Portugal was drawn against Iran, Panama and Cabo Verde. Germany, on paper, have the talent to go deep in 2026, although lifting the trophy might be one step too far forJulian Nagelsmann right now. But simulated opponents in Uruguay and Ghana would offer litmus tests straight away. If they top their group, Die Mannschaft could be in for a memorable summer. On the other hand, unfavorable results could doom the 2014 winners to a third-place finish and a difficult knockout stage run. Brazil, Senegal and Norway would already represent the group of death at any World Cup. This proposed group is full of star talents like Vinicius Junior, Sadio Mane, Erling Haaland and more. If Sweden joins, then there's Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyökeres. Poland would introduce Robert Lewandowski in likely his final World Cup ever. It's near impossible to predict how this group would play out, but have popcorn on standby if it becomes reality. Denmark, North Macedonia, Czechia or Republic of Ireland The Netherlands nearly upset eventual winners Argentina in 2022 losing on penalties. Wout Weghorst's heroics in extra time only delayed elimination and the Oranje will be eager to prove themselves in North America. Japan, Paraguay and a playoff team of either Denmark, North Macedonia, Czechia or the Republic of Ireland certainly offer a talented side like Netherlands the platform to top their group and go on a run. It's Didier Deschamps's last go at the World Cup with France in 2026. Given the emotional nature of Deschamps's final tournament, France should not be overlooked as a potential winner. Lamine Yamal knows very well if he helps Spain win a World Cup next summer he could become the youngest Ballon d'Or winner of all time. The Barcelona prodigy is already a superstar at the club and national team levels and Spain are absolutely loaded with talent. The Euro 2024 winners are a favorite to go all the way next summer, with a simulated group of Switzerland, Egypt and one of Iraq, Bolivia or Suriname offering important tests along the way. Thomas Tuchel was brought in to take England one step further than Sir Gareth Southgate's iterations of the Three Lions. Back-to-back runner-up finishes at the Euros, combined with a quarterfinal exit in Qatar, have the country believing football could truly be coming home. That game could easily determine who finishes top in Group K, while Uzbekistan and a playoff side of either DR Congo, New Caledonia or Jamaica hope they can amass enough points to move on as a third-place team. Belgium's golden generation might not have the silverware it hoped to conquer, but there are still heaps of talent in the squad. If Türkiye joins Ivory Coast and company, fans won't want to miss out on Group L. If it's Romania, Slovakia or Kosovo, predicting who advances might be a little easier.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino's project with the USMNT is moving forward with high expectations ahead of the 2026 World Cup, but his long-term future looks increasingly uncertain. While the United States prepares to host the world's biggest football event, the Argentine coach is beginning to attract attention from major European clubs —a dynamic that could cut his American chapter shorter than expected. And while national-team cycles often conclude naturally after major tournaments, there is another factor at play: his competitive DNA. According to former U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel, speaking exclusively to GOAL, Pochettino is a “workaholic” who thrives on daily training, constant player interaction, and hands-on tactical work. None of that exists at the international level, where long stretches without matches or training camps are standard. If the USMNT has a bad World Cup, Pochettino will not continue. If the team has an excellent World Cup —or even goes all the way— he likely won't continue either, because top European clubs will immediately chase him. Only a solid but not extraordinary tournament would realistically open the door for another cycle. His continuity depends not only on results, but on how he envisions the next four years of his career. Pochettino hasn't hidden it: he misses the Premier League. In an interview with the BBC, he described England's top flight as “the most competitive league in the world” and made clear that he intends to return to club football sooner rather than later. Pochettino hasn't hidden it: he misses the Premier League. In an interview with the BBC, he described England's top flight as “the most competitive league in the world” and made clear that he intends to return to club football sooner rather than later. Tottenham, PSG and Chelsea have all experienced his ability to reshape squads, develop young players and build strong football identities. Friedel also emphasized a key point: the long periods without training during international duty can feel unnatural for someone as detail-oriented as Pochettino. The lack of daily work doesn't suit his personality. La USMNT tiene todo por ganar en 2026… pero podría perder a su arquitecto justo después.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Check out our soccer expert's Fulham vs Man City predictions, prior to Tuesday's 2:30pm ET Premier League clash (12/02). Our betting expert expects a dominant City victory, even though the Cottagers have home advantage. Even though they achieved some positive results recently, Manchester City haven't won away from home in the Premier League since early October. Pep Guardiola will view the match against Fulham as a significant opportunity to change that. Regarding injuries, only Mateo Kovacic and Rodri will be sidelined, so there are no new concerns. Both teams will be very close to what they'd consider full strength. However, those are two of only five clean sheets they have achieved across all competitions. Meanwhile, City have only managed to keep one clean sheet in their last eight fixtures, although they won five of them. Silva will view this game as an opportunity to cause problems. Phil Foden has started to show signs of improvement after a difficult spell. City have plenty of goalscorers and creators, with five players getting goals/assists against Leeds, but Foden's confidence will be high. As usual, there's not much value in Erling Haaland to score, so other options should be considered. Foden is at value to score once again as he steadily approaches a record of 200 direct contributions for his boyhood club. Fulham have been in great form recently, and will go into this game after an impressive away win against Tottenham Hotspur over the weekend. Marco Silva's men have won three of their last four Premier League games and reached 15th place. Confidence will be high for the Cottagers, especially at Craven Cottage. Defeats to Newcastle United and Bayer Leverkusen weren't helpful, but beating Leeds placed them five points behind Arsenal. Pep Guardiola will be eager to see his side keep their momentum going this Tuesday. Fulham expected lineup: Leno, Tete, Andersen, Bassey, Sessegnon, Iwobi, Berge, Wilson, King, Chukwueze, Jimenez Man City expected lineup: Donnarumma; Nunes, Gvardiol, Dias, O'Reilly; Silva, Gonzalez, Cherki; Doku, Haaland, Foden</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new bill will be introduced to the United States House of Representatives on Tuesday which seeks to authorize $50million worth of federal funding every year for host cities to use towards transportation and infrastructure of major sporting events. A draft of the bill, which has been seen by The Athletic, will be introduced by Rep. Rick Larsen, a Democrat who represents Washington's second congressional district. Mr. Larsen's home state of Washington will host six games during the men's World Cup in 2026, including the United States men's national team's (USMNT) second group stage game and two knockout games. Rep. Owens may have a local interest because his home state of Utah will host the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City in 2034. Qualifying events would include the Olympics, Paralympics or Special Olympics, as well as the men's and women's FIFA World Cups, plus any multi-day international sporting events as determined by the transportation secretary. The amount that can be given to an individual host city will be capped at $10m and the bill says that the administration should “allocate amounts evenly to each host metropolitan planning organization” for an event. The 2026 men's World Cup, co-hosted by U.S., Canada and Mexico, will be spread across 11 host cities in the U.S.: New York/New Jersey, Boston, Philadelphia, Miami, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco Bay Area. Earlier this year, President Trump's domestic policy bill — coined as ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill' — set aside $625m in federal funding to aid the security costs of hosting the World Cup in 2026. The bill also included an additional $500 million to be made available for “state and local capabilities to detect, identify, track or monitor threats from unmanned aircraft systems (otherwise known as drones)”, which has also become a key security concern for World Cup stadiums and fan festivals. The bill also included $1billion set aside for security, planning and other costs related to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, California. The World Cup host cities, as per their contracts with FIFA, are expected to carry many of the security costs for the tournament, both at stadiums and in surrounding areas. The vast majority of revenue from the World Cup also goes to FIFA, including ticketing, parking, in-stadium sponsorship and hospitality packages. Host cities are able to sell local sponsorships for fan festivals. As previously reported by The Athletic, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, who represents New Jersey, has previously said MetLife Stadium has already spent $37m on upgrades to enable it to host the final and that New Jersey will take on “$65m in costs for things like transit security for all hubs, bridges, tunnels, and airports”. Miami-Dade County has already approved $46m for services associated with the World Cup. The spend on local taxpayer dollars has received some pushback, particularly after the Miami-Dade mayor previously asked county departments to make submissions for 10 per cent spending cuts. Rep. Rick Larsen, however, insists that the economic impact of the World Cup means taxpayers dollars should receive a healthy return. “I would point to Seattle, which projects the minimum $929million that'll be generated just in King County alone over six World Cup matches,” he said on Monday. The report of this estimate was made by Oxford Economics, which was contracted by Visit Seattle, the official marketing organization of Seattle and King County. Mr. Larsen says the broader region will have additional benefits for hotels, restaurants and day-trips. He says: “I can't tell you there's give me a one for one investment – that'll all be decided after the games are done – but we're looking at hosting a Super Bowl sized game every day for three weeks in the United States. He added: “Host cities are finding they're in varying states of readiness. It is a bill thinking for a long term about the need cities have when these large sporting events come to the U.S. and need help.” Mr. Larsen also played down concerns that games could yet be relocated from World Cup host cities, amid concerns expressed by President Donald Trump about safety in cities run by Democrat mayors. “We do big events there all the time,” he said, insisting Seattle is safe and bristling at what he called the President's “empty threats”. We had 70,000 people at the Leagues Cup final between Seattle and Miami. “I'm proud to be Utah's top advocate on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and to co-lead this effort to give host cities across America the dependable federal partner they need while preparing to host major international sporting events like the Olympics and World Cup. This support strengthens transportation planning, boosts local collaboration, and ensures the United States is ready to shine on the global stage.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Everything you need to know about the FIFA World Cup 2026 draw, including key details, schedule and where to watch the event live. Here's what you need to know about how the draw works, when it's happening and how to watch it live. The draw will divide the 48 qualified and play-off-bound teams into 12 groups of four, using FIFA's latest men's world rankings to allocate nations into four pots. One team from each pot will be drawn into every group. FIFA's draw constraints state that, in principle, no group may contain more than one team from the same confederation, with the exception of UEFA, which must have at least one but no more than two European teams in each group. In addition, the top four teams in the FIFA rankings – Spain, Argentina, France and England – cannot face each other until the semi-finals, provided they win their groups. Forty-two of the 48 tournament places have been secured, with the remaining six to be decided in late March 2026 via four European play-offs and a two-path inter-confederation play-off tournament. Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany. Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Islamic Republic of Iran, Republic of Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia. Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa. Pot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde , Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, four European play-off teams, two intercontinental play-off teams Following the draw, FIFA is scheduled to release the full tournament match schedule — including venues and kick-off times — in a separate broadcast on Saturday 6 December. The FIFA World Cup 2026 draw will be streamed live worldwide on FIFA's official digital platforms, including FIFA.com and the organisation's YouTube and social media channels. The broadcast begins at 17:00 GMT alongside full studio coverage and draw analysis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What once looked like a straightforward January approach for Zirkzee has been thrown in to doubt by his stellar display for United at Crystal Palace over the weekend, and the fact Ruben Amorim could be short on attacking options over the next two months. Zirkzee had endured an excruciating goal drought of nearly eight months, but he finally found the net in United's Premier League win over Palace on Sunday afternoon. His strike was a well-taken equaliser, and it was not only his first since April, when he scored against Lyon in the Europa League, but also his first in England's top flight in close to a year. It was a moment that not only eased personal pressure but also revived questions about his immediate future. "A great feeling, you know, it's always a good feeling to score but most importantly it got us back into the game." When asked about the pressure of going without a goal while playing for United he said: “It's one of the biggest clubs in the world and you have to perform, so if you don't score for a long time then it can get to you. But I'm surrounded by great players, great people and we help each other every day and they made it quite easy for me. Today is just a reward I think for patience, hard work and trying to be consistent and I'm just thankful to the manager as well, staff, everyone. Manager Gian Piero Gasperini has categorised Zirkzee as his priority target, and sporting director Frederic Massara has been pushing to arrange an initial loan agreement. However, Zirkzee's post-match declaration of happiness at United has reportedly unsettled the Serie A club. While his desire for minutes remains known, his public tone of contentment is viewed as a potential obstacle, raising doubts about whether he would push for a mid-season departure. Amorim is also relying on Zirkzee to lead the line while summer signing Benjamin Sesko is out injured, with United's frontline set to be depleted further when Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo head to the AFCON.

Although he scored in a 2-2 draw against United, he has since been restricted largely to late substitute appearances, including in Spurs' latest clash with Fulham. As January draws closer, Roma must now make a firm decision. Whether they return for Zirkzee with renewed conviction or pivot fully toward Tel may define the direction of their winter window.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up now: Get the biggest sports news in your inbox PARIS, Dec 2 - Debutants will take centre stage at Friday's 2026 World Cup draw along with concerns over heat, player welfare and the practical challenge of staging football's biggest tournament across three countries during the peak of a North American summer. For the first time in the tournament's history, 48 teams will be divided into 12 groups of four at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., producing a 104-match schedule across 16 host cities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Soccer's world governing body FIFA has framed the expansion as a watershed moment for inclusivity, opening the door for nations that had never qualified before -- Cape Verde, Uzbekistan, Jordan and Curacao, which, with a population of 150,000, is by far the smallest nation to take part. Others, such as Haiti, return after long waits while Italy still need a playoff to try to avoid the embarrassment of missing out on their third World Cup in a row. This year's Club World Cup in the U.S. served as a dress rehearsal and scorching heat was a major concern. Medical experts and players' unions have raised fears of heat stress, dehydration and reduced recovery times, especially in a format where sides may need to play up to eight matches to lift the trophy – one more than in the 32-team events of the past. FIFA has highlighted the use of indoor or retractable-roof stadiums, including venues in Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and Vancouver, as a key mitigation measure, allowing organisers to control temperatures for a portion of the match programme. However, many fixtures will still be held in open-air stadiums where cooling systems are not an option and where adjusting kickoffs may be the only immediate protection. Broadcasters are seeking prime-time slots for European and Asian audiences, which could push matches into afternoon hours locally, when the heat is most intense. Venue assignments and start times will only be revealed the day after Friday's draw, when FIFA unveils the updated match schedule. The ceremony will place teams into four seeding pots based on world rankings and continental rules. The three hosts are seeded into separate groups alongside top-ranked nations such as defending champions Argentina, Spain, France and England. Provided they win their groups, those teams cannot meet until the later knockout rounds. FIFA has sought to reassure participating nations that operational planning across the three host countries remains unaffected, though the tournament's scale relies heavily on smooth cross-border logistics and consistent entry procedures. FIFA, which said on Monday the 42 teams who had qualified so far would attend, has not responded to requests for comment from Reuters. Some venues offer climate-controlled environments but in other places squads will be exposed to daytime heat stress and longer flights between matches, variables that could shape squad selection and rotation strategies. The final will be staged at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey in July, capping a tournament FIFA president Gianni Infantino has billed as "the most inclusive World Cup ever". As the draw is made in Washington, coaches will be searching less for big-name adversaries than for manageable logistics.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Hayes congratulates players after the USWNT's 6-0 victory over New Zealand on October 29, 2025. Most impressively, the USWNT accomplished this as 16 players earned their first senior national team caps, the most in any calendar year in program history. And yet, Hayes said following the U.S.'s 2-0 win over Italy at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale on Monday night, what she introduced in the spring has not yet become a finished product. “I think about it being a nice winter dish, like slow-cooked stew, and gets better with more time. So concludes a year that has been an exercise in time manipulation. By fortifying pathways to the senior national team, Hayes and her coaching staff — along with under-23 head coach Heather Dyche and under-20 head coach Vicky Jepson, both of whom were hired this year — have been able to compress time for players whose readiness did not match up to the opportunities they were given, and to slow things down for others who were thrust into roles before they were ready. Several of those individuals — like midfielder Claire Hutton, full-backs Lilly Reale and Avery Patterson, center-back Jordyn Bugg, and, most recently, forward Jameese Joseph — have since earned senior team call ups. That Fort Lauderdale has marked the beginning and the end of their year makes for aggressively on-the-nose poetry, but it wasn't designed that way. “It even went back to flying into this airport,” said Patterson, 23, of her Fort Lauderdale memories. “I hadn't been a national team kid growing up, but it was something that was, not a distant goal, but something that you were always striving for that you never quite broke into.” She scored her first national team goal this summer against the Republic of Ireland and has recorded two assists. Integrating into the USWNT, Patterson added, was easier because of that first Fort Lauderdale camp: “It's all of these terms and this new terminology that's being thrown at you and asked of you to learn in such a short time, but you know it's what's expected at the highest level. Hutton, another futures camper-turned-senior-team staple this year at 19, recalled lessons from the team's loss to Brazil in April. “What was so cool about that game, it was a very young squad that was in the lineup,” Hutton said of herself, Korbin Shrader, Lily Yohannes, and Jaedyn Shaw on the eve of the Italy match. “Alyssa (Thompson) was on the field, and we had a meeting before the game with Emma, primarily of the younger players, and she sat us down and basically told us this was a moment for us to take it with stride and know that it was going to be tough, know that there were going to be moments of struggle, which there were in that game, but it was how we were going to respond and reflect on that. But six months later, when the USWNT sought a rebound after a frustrating 2-1 loss to Portugal, Hutton felt prepared. Again, Hayes started younger players in midfield but this time, there was no pre-game sit-down. “What people would say is less experience, but knowing that we went into that game and had more of a calm presence and did have the experience of that Brazil game and of the games throughout the year, just added a layer and it was just cool to see how much we grew as a group,” she said. Hayes has spoken at length this year about utilizing the under-23 team as a developmental pathway for players in that age group, and she's not hesitated to send those who've already gained senior caps to the younger team for more experience. Shaw had 26 national team caps and eight goals under her belt when she was named in two consecutive under-23 squads between May and July. She returned to the senior team in October for the Portugal friendlies and scored her first national team goal this year against Italy on Monday. “Having those conversations with Emma, her being extremely transparent with me about the 23s program, what that's going to look like moving forward for me, and how I can continue to go back and forth just depending on what the camp looks like, is something that's going to help me in the future and to come up big in these moments as well,” Shaw said after the match. Folding so many new players into the team took place alongside returns of veterans like striker Catarina Macario, midfielder Rose Lavelle, and center-back Naomi Girma from their respective injuries. Hayes said the goal conjured tears of pride. “That's what I was celebrating, she's got a little swagger back and that matters to her, not to me, because I always think she puts in great performances. But I saw that there really is another level to her to go — in her words, not mine.” The UWSNT will not begin 2026 with an empty to-do list. By the time Hayes sat for the post-game press conference, her coaching staff had already informed the team's backline that they'd won just 25 percent of their aerial duels that night, an “unacceptable” figure by their standards. And with the expected returns of players like Trinity Rodman, who was not called up due to injury, and Sophia Wilson, who has been on maternity leave this year, competition for a place on the 2027 World Cup roster will stiffen further, offering a different kind of heat to simmer in. It is all part of Hayes' long-term recipe for the program. She also hosts the weekly “Full Time” women's soccer podcast. As a freelance journalist, she covered the 2023 World Cup in Australia and the CONCACAF W Gold Cup for The Athletic, as well as women's soccer stories for ESPN Andscape, USA Today's Pro Soccer Wire, and other publications.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FIFA World Cup draw is an event that comes around only once every four years – but it can do plenty to determine a football nation's morale heading into the sport's most prestigious global competition. The process will then continue with Pots 2, 3, and 4, in that order, FIFA explained. Each nation's name is printed on a slip of paper, which is then folded and placed inside a plastic ball numbered 1 to 4 to represent one of the four pots. Draw representatives mix up the balls in large glass bowls (pots) – and then extract one ball at a time from each pot to form the groups. The other top nine FIFA-seeded nations will be spread across the remaining nine groups: C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, and L. There is less certainty for the remaining 36 teams, but specific rules do apply: The 2026 World Cup draw rewards the four highest-ranked teams – Spain, Argentina, France and England – who will be placed in separate sections, or quadrants, of a new tennis-style seeded tournament bracket. Defending champions Argentina (No 2 ranked) with Lionel Messi and top-ranked European champions Spain (No 1 ranked) with Lamine Yamal, therefore, can ensure they do not meet until the final at MetLife Stadium near New York. Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (three host nations and nine top-seeded) Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Uzbekistan, Qatar, South Africa President Donald Trump's administration announced in June a travel ban on citizens from 12 countries, including Iran, although exemptions were promised for “any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the secretary of state”. The draw will also be broadcast by FIFA's media partners. Al Jazeera Sport will provide live text commentary of the draw.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026 draw on Friday 5 December, the Opta supercomputer has produced its early predictions for this summer's tournament in North America. The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw takes place in Washington D.C. on 5 December, allowing fans of all nations to start plotting their routes to a possible coronation at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium. But most of the favourites are set, with Lionel Messi hoping to help Argentina become the first team since Brazil in 1962 to successfully defend their crown. Argentina, though, will face fierce competition, not least from 2022 runners-up France and reigning European champions Spain. And what of a Norway team spearheaded by Manchester City goal machine Erling Haaland? Ahead of this week's draw, we have taken a deep dive into the Opta supercomputer's first set of World Cup predictions to assess who is most likely to lift the trophy. At Euro 2024, Luis de la Fuente's Spain produced one of the most eye-catching international tournament successes in recent memory. La Roja swept all before them, winning six of their seven matches inside 90 minutes and only requiring extra-time to eliminate hosts Germany in the quarter-final. They scored 15 goals in the tournament – four more than anyone else. And there has been no downturn from De la Fuente's side since. Spain are now unbeaten in their last 31 competitive games (W25 D6, excluding penalty shootouts), beating the famous 30-match run they enjoyed under Vicente del Bosque between 2010 and 2013 – a streak that saw them win both the World Cup and the Euros. By the time the next international break comes around in March, it'll be three years since Spain last lost a competitive match. That defeat came away at Scotland on 28 March 2023 in a Euro 2024 qualifier (2-0). It is little surprise, then, that Spain are our predictive model's early World Cup favourites, going all the way in 17.0% of tournament predictions. If Spain are to triumph, it is likely Lamine Yamal will play a key role. Their Euro 2024 triumph came the day after Yamal's 17th birthday, as he replaced Pelé (1958, 17 years, 249 days) as the youngest player to feature in a World Cup or European Championship final. Yamal created the most chances at the tournament, with 19, while only teammate Nico Williams (2.1) had more expected assists (xA) than his 2.0. But if their key players enter the tournament in good health, Spain will be supremely confident of repeating their feat from 2008-12 of holding the Euros and World Cup trophies at the same time. He will hope to go out with a bang and cement his legacy as France's greatest boss. Deschamps' reign has comprised 175 games, so if they reach the first knockout round, he will have overseen 100 games more than France's next-longest serving boss (Raymond Domenech, 79). After watching his team fall agonisingly short on penalties against Argentina in Qatar, he has another chance to become only the second coach to win multiple World Cups (after Vittorio Pozzo in 1934 and 1938). Deschamps also lifted the trophy as a player when he was captain in 1998 and this will be Kylian Mbappé's first World Cup as France skipper. The Real Madrid sensation will be targeting individual and team records. There is a good chance that record falls before the World Cup, but he is also chasing down Miroslav Klose's all-time total of 16 goals at World Cups, having netted 12 times in just two editions of the tournament (four in 2018, eight in 2022). Ousmane Dembélé won the 2025 Ballon d'Or after spearheading Paris Saint-Germain's run to a first UEFA Champions League crown, scoring 33 goals and recording 13 assists in 2024-25 from a central attacking role. Finding a way to get Mbappé and Dembélé to function in the same attack will be one of the major conundrums facing Deschamps. The only one other team assigned more than a one-in-10 chance of becoming world champions is England, who are out to end 60 years of hurt at major tournaments. The Three Lions enter their first – and potentially only – tournament under Tuchel as third favourites with a 11.8% probability of lifting the trophy, having come up short in two European Championship finals under Gareth Southgate. Tuchel's task is simple – get international football's nearly men over the line. His England reign took some time to get going, as England laboured past Albania (3-0), Latvia (2-0), Andorra (1-0 and 2-0) and were beaten 3-1 by Senegal in a June friendly. But a rampant 5-0 victory in Serbia in September showcased the Three Lions' potential, and the emergence of Elliot Anderson seems to have finally ended their search for a central midfield partner for Declan Rice. England ultimately finished Group K with eight wins – and eight clean sheets – from as many matches, becoming only the second team to win all their games in a UEFA World Cup qualifying campaign without conceding after Yugoslavia in 1954. Southgate's England teams were also solid at the back but rarely free-flowing. At Euro 2024, they recorded just 5.4 xG – Turkey, Austria and Switzerland were among the teams to better that tally. So, Tuchel is also expected to provide better entertainment, and he certainly has the tools to do so, with a stunning array of options to choose from, particularly in the attacking midfield positions. There should be plenty of service for Harry Kane, who is Europe's most in-form striker, netting 24 goals in 20 matches for Bayern Munich since the start of the season in August. But there is a competitive race for the positions behind the England skipper after Tuchel suggested Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden could not both start, while Cole Palmer's season has barely got going due to injuries. Given the way England often toiled at Euro 2024, Tuchel's refusal to crowbar in the big names could come as a breath of fresh air, and the likes of Eberechi Eze and Morgan Rogers are staking impressive claims. Messi also led all players in Qatar for shots (32), chances created from open play (17) and fouls won (22), becoming the second player to top all three metrics at a single World Cup. Now, he gets the opportunity to do something even Maradona could not accomplish – win a second World Cup. Messi has shown no signs of slowing down, helping Inter Miami reach the Major League Soccer Cup final while contributing a staggering 35 goals and providing 21 assists in MLS action this year. The attacker already leads all players for appearances (26) and goal involvements (21, since assists were first recorded in 1966) at World Cups, while Messi's battle to break Klose's goal record before Mbappé is an enthralling additional storyline. A lack of recent match practice against top-class European opponents could count against the Albiceleste, who also saw Ángel Di María retire from international football after the Copa América. But by the time next year's tournament rolls around, it will have been 12 years since Germany played a knockout game at a World Cup. That was when they beat Argentina in the 2014 final. Julian Nagelsmann's side were beaten in the quarter-finals on home soil at Euro 2024, marking the first time Germany have appeared at four major tournaments (World Cup/Euros) in a row without reaching a semi-final at any of them. Their route to this World Cup was not completely smooth, either, as they were left needing victory over Slovakia in their final Group A game to avoid the play-offs. But they won that match by a statement 6-0 scoreline, with Nick Woltemade, Serge Gnabry and Leroy Sané among the goals. Germany arguably played some of the best football at Euro 2024, ranking second for average possession (62.5%) and goals scored (11), but Nagelsmann has plenty of selection dilemmas to consider. Marc-André ter Stegen has lost his place as Barcelona's first-choice goalkeeper after undergoing back surgery, while Nagelsmann has tested multiple midfield pairings since Toni Kroos' retirement – Aleksandar Pavlović partnered Leon Goretzka in the final two qualifiers. Germany have at least scraped into Pot 1 for the group-stage draw, taking the 12th and final spot among the top seeds, ahead of Croatia, and despite question marks it would be rash not to consider them as contenders at this stage. But the five-time Ballon d'Or winner simply cannot stop making headlines, with FIFA recently announcing Ronaldo would not serve the typical three-match ban following his red card in Portugal's defeat to the Republic of Ireland, freeing him up to play their World Cup opener. And after Messi finally ended his wait for a World Cup win in Qatar, Portugal are assigned a 6.6% chance of giving Ronaldo his own crowning moment. Like Messi, Ronaldo will appear at a record-breaking sixth edition of the World Cup, but of his eight goals in 22 games at the tournament, three have been penalties and none have come in the knockout stages. However, this year's Nations League triumph offers significant hope that Roberto Martínez can get the balance right even while accommodating the 40-year-old, who is still full of confidence after scoring 84 goals in 86 Saudi Pro League games. Ancelotti was only in charge for the final five games of their campaign, but less than eight months into his reign, he has already overseen surprise defeats to Bolivia and Japan, as well as poor draws with Ecuador and Tunisia. Next year, it will have been 24 years since Brazil last lifted the World Cup. They have only endured one previous drought of that length since first winning the tournament in 1958, between 1970 and 1994. That previous dry spell ended, of course, in the United States, and Brazil are assigned a 5.6% chance of another stateside triumph. Vinícius has played under five different head coaches since joining Real Madrid, and 149 of his 192 goal involvements for the club came during Ancelotti's second spell in charge of Los Blancos. Their current side has a distinctly English influence, with four Premier League players scoring in their final World Cup qualifier versus Lithuania (4-0, Tijjani Reijnders, Cody Gakpo, Xavi Simons and Donyell Malen) – the first time that has occurred for the Netherlands. One recurring issue in recent years has been their lack of a true centre-forward. But Memphis Depay remains a talisman for his nation, becoming their all-time leading scorer when he netted his 51st international goal in September. The USMNT appointed Pochettino after of a humiliating group-stage exit as Copa América hosts last year, and things did not immediately improve as the Argentine lost five of his first 10 matches at the helm. Along with the Gold Cup run, a 5-1 win over Uruguay last time out put Pochettino's critics on notice, and the USA should feel good about their chances of being competitive in the knockout stages. It remains to be seen how the introduction of a round of 32 will affect El Tri, who lost in the round of 16 at seven consecutive World Cups before suffering a group-stage exit in Qatar. Javier Aguirre's team will play in the tournament's opening match, in Mexico City on 11 June, but they failed to win any of their final six games in 2025 (D3 L3) – all of them friendlies – with five of those coming against teams lower than them in the FIFA World Rankings. There will likely be an experienced feel to their squad, led by Fulham striker Raúl Jiménez, who is only eight away from Javier Hernández's all-time Mexico goal record of 52. But it remains to be seen whether 40-year-old goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa will earn a historic call-up. Mere weeks into Jesse Marsch's reign, Canada reached the semi-finals on their Copa América debut, losing 2-0 to eventual winners Argentina. But a stunning defeat to Guatemala, in another shootout, ended Canada's Gold Cup campaign at the quarter-final stage and brought them crashing down to earth. If Canada are to spring a surprise on home soil (their Group B fixtures will all be played in Toronto or Vancouver), they will need Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies to be in peak condition, having been sidelined with an anterior cruciate ligament injury since March. In addition to the top eight favourites, there are two other teams given at least a 2% chance of winning the World Cup – Norway (2.3%) and Colombia (2.0%). Haaland struck 16 of those goals, matching Robert Lewandowski's 2018 record for the most prolific UEFA World Cup qualification campaign. Lewandowski scored his tally in 10 games, two more than Haaland. The resurgence of James Rodríguez made headlines at that competition, as he led the way for chances created (20) and assists (six) – that latter tally equalled the record for a single edition, alongside Brazil's Alex in 2003. Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, now teammates at Napoli, and Thibaut Courtois will all feature at a fourth edition of the World Cup – no player has ever represented Belgium at more (Enzo Scifo also four). This will be Rudi Garcia's first tournament in charge since replacing Domenico Tedesco in January, and even if Belgium are no longer the force they once were – they drew three of their eight qualifiers and only finished two points ahead of Wales – they remain a threat. Inspirational Croatia captain Luka Modrić is hoping to appear at his fifth World Cup at the age of 40, and no team will want to see Croatia drawn into their group from Pot 2. And of course, there are also six teams still to be decided in March's play-offs. There is currently a combined 3.7% chance of any of those sides going all the way, with Italy surely the most likely candidates if they can end their World Cup exile. They must get past Northern Ireland and potentially Wales to make it, with both of those sides hoping to join fellow home nations England and Scotland. Sweden (in 1958) and Czechia (in 1934 and 1962) have both been World Cup finalists previously (the latter as Czechoslovakia) but could still miss the tournament, as could former European champions Denmark. If previous World Cups are anything to go by, shocks and surprises should be a given, so all those teams will still be dreaming of a deep run. With 48 teams taking part, there also will be some new names gracing the tournament. Debutants Uzbekistan are seen as having a slightly better chance of impressing than the other new nations, as they have a 0.2% chance of going all the way. A more realistic aim might be getting through the groups after impressing in AFC qualification – beating out sides like Qatar and United Arab Emirates. They fared slightly better with our model than the other first-timers Curaçao and Jordan (both 0.04%). Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Panama and New Zealand all could be in for a difficult summer as they have the same rating as Cape Verde (all 0.1%). As things stand, the least likely nation to prevail after coming out bottom in our simulations is Haiti (0.03%), who have qualified for the first time since 1974, but it already looks clear there are going to be some brilliant stories from top to bottom in next year's tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Catarina Macario scored in her third straight international match, and the United States women's national team defeated Italy, 2-0, on Monday night in their final game this year. The United States has scored in 16 straight matches, including all 15 this year. The national team wrapped up 2025 with a 12-3-0 record. Jaedyn Shaw added a second goal before halftime, taking a pass from Alyssa Thompson before squaring up and calmly finishing out of Durante's reach to make it 2-0. “I think they're my favorite performances of the year.” Macario, who plays for Chelsea, led the team this year with eight goals, including seven goals in her last seven starts. She nearly got a second goal at Ft. Lauderdale's Chase Stadium but it was disallowed because of a foul, denying her a third brace in her last three international games. “That's what I was celebrating was, she's got a little swagger back and that matters to her, not to me, because I always think she puts in great performances. Macario and Emily Fox were among the players named earlier Monday as nominees for the women's US Soccer Player of the Year award, joining Rose Lavelle, Alyssa Thompson, and Sam Coffey. Hayes made five changes to the starting lineup from Friday's victory in the first game against Italy, going with veterans Naomi Girma, Lindsey Heaps, Fox, and Macario. The US national team will next gather from Jan. 17-27 for the team's annual camp in Carson, Calif., with a match planned against Paraguay and another against an undetermined opponent.</p>
