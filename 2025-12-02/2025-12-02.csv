            Dressed head to toe in army fatigues, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday received the news he had been awaiting for more than a year: Russia had taken over the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk.
    


            It doesn't matter that Kyiv disputed the claim, saying on Tuesday that fighting was still going on inside the city and that Moscow's “bravura statements” about the capture of Pokrovsk “do not match the reality.”
    


            The point of the highly choreographed meeting between Putin and his top military brass was to show the world that Russia is winning in Ukraine.
    


            The Kremlin said Putin was informed of the victory during a visit to a “command post” on Sunday, although both were only publicized late on Monday, on the eve of the Russian leader's meeting with key aides to US President Donald Trump.
    


Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, accompanied by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, was set to meet Putin later on Tuesday – the latest instalment of a diplomatic whirlwind by the US aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.
    


            Putin has indicated he has no interest in finding compromises. He reiterated his maximalist demands that Ukraine limits the size of its army, gives up some of its territory, and is banned from joining NATO.
    


            The proposal Witkoff is bringing to Putin has not been made public, but Ukraine has made it clear it cannot accept any peace plan that would encroach on its sovereignty along the lines of Moscow's demands.
    


            Putin's visit to the military post on Sunday, just before his meeting with the Americans, was clearly designed to portray Putin as a strong war-time leader who has the upper hand in Ukraine.
    


            Unlike Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who travels to the frontlines to meet soldiers on fairly regular basis, the Russian leader tends to keep his distance from the war.
    


            His interactions with the military are rare but carefully timed – such as when he traveled to Kursk in March, just days before one of his previous meetings with Witkoff in Moscow.
    


            Speaking to his top generals on Sunday, Putin praised them for “liberating” Pokrovsk, which he called by its Soviet-era name of Krasnoarmiisk, which translates as “Red Army City.”
    


Trump envoy to meet with Putin as US pushes to end war in Ukraine



            Kremlin made a point of the Pokrovsk developments on Monday, publishing a video showing Russian soldiers unfurling a Russian flag in Pokrovsk's city center – even though that particular area has been under Moscow's control for some time.
    


            The strategic value of Pokrovsk, which served as a Ukrainian supply hub earlier in the war, has been greatly diminished during the many months of heavy fighting. But its seizure would nevertheless represent the biggest win for Moscow since 2023.
    


            Ukrainian troops on the ground in Pokrovsk told CNN that the situation was extremely difficult.
    


            One Ukrainian commander with a unit fighting in the city said that Russian troops had “nowhere near complete control” of Pokrovsk and that his unit was still holding onto their positions inside the city. However, another soldier said that it was “mostly true” that Russia was in control.
    


            CNN cannot publish the soldiers' name due to security restrictions.
    


            This declarations around Pokrovsk echoed the bold statements Russia made about “piercing” the Ukrainian frontline back in August, just days before the meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska.
    


            Speaking at the command post on Sunday, Putin stressed that the Russian military was “advancing at a pace that guarantees the completion of all our objectives.” He doubled down on the claim he made last week, when he threatened Kyiv that if it doesn't agree to give up some of its territories, including the rest of the Donetsk region, willingly in the negotiations, Russia will take them by force.
    


            George Barros, who leads the Russia and Geospatial Intelligence teams at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, said the messaging by Putin is aimed at Ukraine's western allies as much as it is at Ukraine.
    


            “If he can successfully convince the world that Russia's battlefield victory is inevitable, then that leads to the question (among Kyiv's allies) ‘Why are we supporting Ukraine? Let's just negotiate now,'” Barros told CNN last month.
    


            But while Russia is inching forward along the frontlines in eastern Ukraine, its overall victory is not at all certain, Barros said. The latest ISW assessment of the Russian forces' rate of advance indicates that a Russian military victory in Ukraine is “not inevitable” and that a quick Russian military takeover of the rest of the Donetsk region – which Putin has been threatening – is unlikely.
    


            So even though Putin and his military commanders continue to tout Russian advances and peddle the narrative of their inevitable victory, the easiest way for Russia to get what it wants is either by coercing Ukraine into taking a bad deal, or by convincing Kyiv's allies to ease out their support.
    


            The US would be key for either of the two options.

The upcoming visit of President Vladimir Putin to India is a major step toward deepening Moscow's partnership with the South Asian nation, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov has said. 

In an interview with news outlet ANI on Tuesday, Manturov described the presidential visit as a return to the tradition of annual high-level summits.

Putin is slated to arrive in India on December 4 for a two-day trip. It will be his tenth visit to India and his first since 2021. 

Manturov said both sides have thoroughly prepared the agenda to ensure that the meetings are productive. 

“That would be the first visit of our President Vladimir Putin to your friendly country for a long period of time,” he told ANI. “That returns us to the tradition of annual high-level summits which represents an undeniable success. Together with our Indian colleagues we have thoroughly prepared the agenda for the visit. We expect that all the meetings and negotiations that are to take place will be fruitful and will give new momentum for our two countries' strategic cooperation in all areas.”

He said senior government and business leaders from both sides would also meet under the auspices of the India-Russia Forum.

The forum will explore ways to expand and diversify bilateral trade, including boosting Indian exports of equipment, raw materials, and food products to Russia, Manturov added.

The deputy PM is also the co-chair of the India-Russia Inter-governmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technological and Cultural Cooperation.

MOSCOW, December 2. /TASS/. Paris is still looking for ways to take a direct part in the Ukraine conflict, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) said in a press release.

""France is eager to send its troops to Ukraine. The press bureau of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) of the Russian Federation informs that, according to the information coming to the SVR, France is still seeking ways to directly participate in the conflict in Ukraine,"" the press release reads. The SVR cited a French government decree authorizing the use of private military companies (PMCs) for assistance to ""a third state facing an armed conflict.""

According to the SVR, even a ""politically unsophisticated ordinary European"" would guess what country is implied in the document. ""Mobile air defense groups and the limited number of F-16 Fighting Falcons available to Ukraine are unable to intercept Russian air targets. Learning how to operate Mirage Fighter Jets and other machinery requires a lot of time and a high level of expertise,"" the SVR argued. ""This is why Kiev will need foreign PMCs equipped with modern Western, primarily French, weaponry,"" it explained.

However, the SVR cautioned Paris against deluding itself into thinking that ""this will allow it to untie its hands and simultaneously evade responsibility for its troops' participation in the conflict."" ""The presence of French PMCs in Ukraine, modestly referred to as `reference operators' of the Ministry of Armed Forces in the aforementioned decree, will be considered by Moscow as France's direct engagement in hostilities against Russia,"" the SVR warned. ""Consequently, French PMCs will become a high-priority legal target for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation,"" the SVR concluded.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, December 2. /TASS/. Russia, China, and India have long maintained strong bonds of friendship and strategic partnership. During the plenary session of the Russia Calling! forum, Russian President Vladimir Putin underscored Moscow's ambition to elevate this cooperation to a new, more advanced level - specifically by enhancing its technological dimension.

Putin highlighted Russia's commitment to expanding collaboration with interested nations, noting that the majority of these countries - acting rationally and pragmatically - are eager to deepen their partnerships. He pointed out that over the past three years, Russia has notably increased its trade volume with these key allies, particularly China and India, countries with which Russia shares decades of friendship and strategic ties.

""I am aware that many representatives of Chinese and Indian delegations are present here today,"" Putin remarked. ""I want to emphasize our goal to take our cooperation with the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India to a qualitatively new level by strengthening its technological component.""

According to the Russian leader, numerous joint projects in energy, industry, space, agriculture, and many other areas are already aimed at this. ""We have established a substantive dialogue with Chinese President Xi Jinping on economic issues, and we will also discuss these topics in detail during my upcoming visit to India with Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" Putin stated.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, December 2. /TASS/. At a plenary session, the State Duma ratified an intergovernmental agreement between Russia and India on procedures for dispatching military personnel, as well as military ships and aircraft, to each other's territory. The Russian Cabinet of Ministers submitted the document to the lower house of parliament in November.

The explanatory note says that the agreement will streamline not only the dispatch of troops and equipment, but also their logistics. The established procedure will be used during joint exercises, training sessions, humanitarian aid, disaster relief efforts after natural and man-made disasters, and in other cases by agreement.

The Cabinet indicated that ratification of the document will simplify the mutual use of the two countries' airspace and the entry of Russian and Indian warships into each other's ports.

Defense secretary shares anecdote in The War on Warriors and rails against ‘rules and regulations' governing war

Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, told soldiers under his command in Iraq to ignore legal advice about when they were permitted to kill enemy combatants under their rules of engagement.

The anecdote is contained in a book Hegseth wrote last year in which he also repeatedly railed against the constraints placed on “American warfighters” by the laws of war and the Geneva conventions.

Hegseth is currently under scrutiny for a 2 September attack on a boat purportedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean, where survivors of a first strike on the vessel were reportedly killed in a second strike following a verbal order from Hegseth to “kill everybody”.

Hegseth has denied giving the order and retained the support of Donald Trump. The US president said Hegseth told him “he did not say that, and I believe him, 100%”. But some US senators have raised the possibility that the US war secretary committed a war crime.

In the book, The War on Warriors, Hegseth relates a story about a legal briefing at the beginning of his service in Iraq, in which he told the men under his command to ignore guidance from a military judge advocate general's (JAG) attorney's guidance about the rules of engagement in the conflict.

Hegseth writes that “upon arrival in Iraq”, the men were briefed “regarding the latest ‘in theater' rules of engagement”, adding: “Needless to say, no infantrymen like army lawyers – which is why JAG officers are often not so affectionately known as ‘jagoffs'.”

He added of JAG lawyers: “Most spend more time prosecuting our troops than they do putting away bad guys. It's easier to get promoted that way.”

Hegseth writes that in explaining the rules of engagement, the JAG officer “used the example of an identified enemy holding a rocket-propelled grenade”, asking Hegseth's platoon: “‘Do you shoot at him?'”

“And my guys were like, ‘Hell, yeah, we light him up,'” Hegseth writes.

According to Hegseth, the JAG officer responded: “‘Wrong answer, men. You are not authorized to fire at that man, until that RPG becomes a threat. It must be pointed at you with the intent to fire. That makes it a legal and proper engagement.'”

Hegseth writes that in response: “We sat in silence, stunned.”

He then instructed his men to ignore the legal advice.

“After this briefing, I pulled my platoon together, huddling amid their confusion to tell them, ‘I will not allow that nonsense to filter into your brains. Men, if you see an enemy who you believe is a threat, you engage and destroy the threat. That's a bullshit rule that's going to get people killed. And I will have your back – just like our commander. We are coming home, the enemy will not.'”

The Guardian contacted the Department of Defense for comment.

Prof David M Crane, a former chief prosecutor of the UN special court for Sierra Leone, distinguished scholar in residence at Syracuse University College of Law and an army veteran with 20 years' service, including stints as a JAG attorney, said obeying rules of engagement was crucial and that those who break them should face sanction.

“After the tragedy of My Lai in 1968, we have tried to avoid another one and prosecute those that do in fact stray. And that happened particularly in Iraq, at Fallujah, and other places in defense, where we had some marines go south and commit war crimes, and they're prosecuted for it,” he said.

He added: “These rules go all the way up the chain of command. I mean, it goes all the way to the president of the United States, who is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the United States.

“So if there's an illegal order that goes all the way down, then all of them have committed a war crime. It's not just a single guy in the airplane, the jet aircraft, firing those missiles at the boat. Yes, they are following an illegal order, but it goes all the way up all the way to the president.”

In his book, however, Hegseth called into question the entire edifice of laws of conflict, writing: “If our warriors are forced to follow rules arbitrarily and asked to sacrifice more lives so that international tribunals feel better about themselves, aren't we just better off winning our wars according to our own rules?! Who cares what other countries think.”

In Trump's first term, Hegseth successfully campaigned for the pardon of two army officers and the reversal of disciplinary measures on a Navy Seal, each of whom were either charged with or convicted of war crimes. He has expressed admiration for his former commanding officer, the now retired army colonel and, according to Hegseth, “certified badass” Michael Steele, who was reprimanded after reportedly ordering soldiers in 2006 in Iraq to “kill all military age males” in a raid.

Crane said of Hegseth's portrayal of a fundamental antagonism between JAG lawyers and soldiers that it was “absolutely not true”, and that “the bottom line is that judge advocates are soldiers who are lawyers, [and] whose job is to make sure soldiers don't commit violations of the laws of armed conflict, and the soldiers appreciate it”.

He added: “I have deployed around the world in some very scary places with my unit as their lawyer, but I did everything that my unit did: jumping on airplanes, scaling cliffs, doing all the things that you know about these very specialized organizations. I did it too. I was right there with them. They respected me. I respected them. And they listened to me.”

In the same passage of the book as his anecdote, Hegseth praises his then commander, who was later reprimanded for his own role in an incident in which unarmed Iraqis were killed by US soldiers.

He commends “Colonel Michael Steele … our brigade commander” as “a certified badass”, adding that Steele incentivized the killing of Iraqis: “He suffered no fools. If you engaged the enemy and destroyed it under his command, you got a ‘kill coin'.”

Hegseth adds: “Colonel Steele would have been a horrible gender studies professor at the University of California, but there was nobody you wanted more in a combat situation.”

Steele was commander of the 3rd Brigade, 187th Infantry Regiment in the 101st Airborne Division between 2004 and 2006, under whom Hegseth served as a platoon commander.

In 2006, four soldiers under his command were charged with the murder of unarmed Iraqis during a raid in Salahuddin province, and in sworn statements the men said Steele had “ordered them to kill all military-age males”.

Media reports at that time indicated that Steele had promoted body counts as a measure of performance, with the New York Times reporting of Steele that “in Iraq, as a commander involved in harrowing assaults against insurgents, he inspired the use of ‘kill boards' to track how many Iraqis each soldier had killed over time”.

In 2007, the New York Times reported that Steele had been formally reprimanded for issuing improper orders for the raid, effectively blocking his further promotion, and had been rotated out of Iraq to an administrative assignment.

Crane said: “You know, we have commanders who are ‘badasses' – and most of them don't go into higher rank, because they're quietly removed from the service, or they're court-martialed and removed, or reprimanded, or put in jail.”

He added: “Colonel Steele was completely outside the bounds. That mentality is frowned upon, and that's why he was reprimanded and his career was ended.”

He said: “This shows you the mindset of this secretary of defense: that's the kind of person, that's the signal they're sending the commanders – kill them all and let God sort them out.”

In the book, Hegseth ventilates more general grievances about legal restraints placed on soldiers in combat.

At one point, Hegseth writes: “We send men to fight on our behalf, and then second-guess the manner in which they fight. I saw it every day.”

Hegseth adds: “In some cases, our units were so boxed in by rules and regulations and political correctness, we even second-guess ourselves. That needs to end. Count me out on the Monday-morning quarterbacking – I'm with the American warfighter, all the way.”

Elsewhere, Hegseth appears to argue that American soldiers should proceed without any constraints whatsoever.

He writes: “If we're going to send our boys to fight – and it should be boys – we need to unleash them to win. They need them to be the most ruthless. The most uncompromising. The most overwhelmingly lethal as they can be. We must break the enemy's will.”

Hegseth adds an apparent call for virtual impunity for serving soldiers, writing: “Our troops will make mistakes, and when they do, they should get the overwhelming benefit of the doubt.”

The idea that soldiers should be given the benefit of the doubt echoes comments Hegseth made in November 2019, after Trump pardoned Clint Lorance, then serving a 19-year sentence for the murder of two civilians; Maj Mathew Golsteyn, who was facing murder charges over the killing of an unarmed Afghan civilian; and reversed the demotion of Navy Seal Edward Gallagher, who in July 2019 was found not guilty of murder over the death of an IS captive, but was convicted for posing for photos with the man's corpse.

At that time, Hegseth, still a news presenter but widely credited for influencing Trump to clear the men, told the Fox News audience that Trump had shown “fidelity to the warfighter”.

“The president looks at it through that lens, a simple one, and important one. The benefit of the doubt should go to the guys pulling the trigger.”

Crane said that such pardons “cheapen the profession. Having been in the military myself there's a great amount of pride among the professionals within the US armed forces, and they take great pride in following the law and doing things appropriately under law.”

He added: “The force is irritated now and embarrassed because they truly believe in separating themselves from politics, and they are America's armed forces, not the president's armed forces.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Defense secretary has been insisting that an admiral gave the order for the second strike on alleged drug boat back in September

Trump administration is ‘selling out' admiral to shield Hegseth over boat strikes, officials say

Pete Hegseth told US soldiers in Iraq to ignore legal advice on rules of engagement

“We always have the backs of our commanders,” Hegseth said, insisting that “they've done the right things” in making judgement calls in difficult situations.

He's alluding to Admiral Frank M Bradley, the military commander whom Hegseth has been insisting since yesterday gave the order for the second strike on the alleged drug boat on 2 September. The White House has also been backing this narrative, leading some some officials in Congress and the Pentagon, as well as Democrats, to now fear that Bradley is being made a scapegoat for the potentially illegal order.

Transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, reiterated his call for passengers to “bring their better selves” when flying in an effort to “bring civility back to travel”.

“If you have a someone's pregnant on your flight and you're as strong as Pete is,” Duffy said, looking and joking with the defense secretary during Trump's cabinet meeting. “Well pick up the bag and help her, put it in the overhead bin. Let's be nice to each other.”

The secretary reiterated his calls for passengers to “maybe not wear pajamas or slippers on the airplane”.

“We always have the backs of our commanders,” Hegseth said, insisting that “they've done the right things” in making judgement calls in difficult situations.

He's alluding to Admiral Frank M Bradley, the military commander whom Hegseth has been insisting since yesterday gave the order for the second strike on the alleged drug boat on 2 September. The White House has also been backing this narrative, leading some some officials in Congress and the Pentagon, as well as Democrats, to now fear that Bradley is being made a scapegoat for the potentially illegal order.

In his first public outing since the Washington Post reported that he ordered a second strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat that killed two shipwrecked survivors, Pete Hegseth doubled down on strikes on boats in the Caribbean:

We've only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean, because they've been poisoning the American people.

“We're going to New Orleans soon” with the national guard, Trump said, adding that the Republican governor (and staunch ally of the president) of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, had called him and asked for help.

“We're going there in a couple of weeks,” Trump said.

Trump told the cabinet meeting that he would be announcing his selection for the next chair of the Federal Reserve early next year.

He added that he talked to treasury secretary Scott Bessent about taking over the Fed but Bessent didn't want the job.

Donald Trump's cabinet meeting started a short while ago a little behind schedule. I'll bring you all the key lines here.

Also earlier, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called Hegseth “spineless” and “a national embarrassment” and called for the defense secretary to release the full unedited tape of the deadly strikes on the alleged drug boat off the coast of Venezuela on 2 September.

Schumer pointed to a recent appearance on Fox News where Hegseth “bragged that he was present at every moment of the operation” but is now claiming Admiral Bradley made the decision about the second strike.

“The minute trouble arises, Hegseth says someone else was making the decision,” Schumer said.

As well as releasing the tape, Schumer said the defense secretary must testify publicly on the matter, as well as briefing the Senate in a classified setting.

Meanwhile, at the Democrats press conference earlier, representative Ted Lieu of California called on Pete Hegseth to resign, saying the defense secretary lied about the second strike on the suspected drug-smuggling boat and “and threw Admiral Bradley under the bus”.

“Killing shipwreck survivors is a war crime,” said Lieu, a former lawyer with the US Air Force Judge Advocate General's Corps. He said there was no statute of limitation on war crimes and the justice department should conduct an investigation and hold everyone accountable.

Hegseth “engaged in dishonorable conduct”, Lieu said, adding: “He is a coward, he must resign, you deserve better.”

Fellow California representative Pete Aguilar reiterated that they feel Hegseth should resign but added that Republicans would never go with impeachment.

“Members of the military need to tell the truth,” he said. “We need a full accounting of what happened on that day with that strike”.

Wilson said today that Pentagon can “100% confirm that we know, without a shadow of a doubt, who these Narco terrorists are”.

While Wilson said the department knows what these suspected carters are “carrying, where they're coming from and where they're going,” she declined to provide details about the Pentagon's intelligence efforts. “I don't want to communicate to the enemy, the ways in which we're carrying out these strikes,” she added.

At a briefing today, Department of Defense press secretary Kingsley Wilson said that the “decision to re-strike the narco terrorist vessel was made by Adm Bradley”. 

Wilson added that Bradley was operating under “clear and longstanding authorities to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States was eliminated”.

She re-affirmed that defense secretary Pete Hegseth stands behind Bradley. “Adm Bradley made the right call, and unlike the previous administration, we have our war fighters back at this department,” Wilson said.

While answering questions from reporters today, Mike Johnson said he doesn't know how much of the video recording of the second strike on alleged drug-trafficking boat, which reportedly killed two survivors, should be released.

“I'm not sure how much is sensitive with regard to national security,” he said. “I haven't had a chance to review it, so I'm not going to prejudge it.”

Johnson reiterated that US Navy admiral Frank Bradley made the decision to launch the second strike. “He's a highly decorated, highly respected admiral in the Navy, and he made that call, and so, you know, we're going to have to look at that,” Johnson said.

House speaker Mike Johnson quickly plugged the Matt Van Epps, the Republican candidate in the special election for Tennessee's seventh congressional district.

Ballots are being cast today, in a race that's become more competitive in a seat that's been a conservative stronghold in elections past. A reminder, Trump won the district by 22 points in 2024.

“He's a combat veteran. He flew combat missions, deployed eight times over to the Middle East and dodge missiles and bullets for his country. He worked in Tennessee State Government, and is a highly capable, competent, calm, common sense conservative,” Johnson said of Van Epps.

A recent poll from Emerson College and the Hill had Van Epps leading his Democratic challenger, Aftyn Behn, by just two points.

Today, Johnson reiterated that “anything can happen” in a special election.

“When you're in a deep red district, sometimes people assume that the Republican, the conservative, will win. You cannot assume that,” Johnson said.

House Republicans are now holding a press conference on Capitol Hill. I'll bring you the key lines here. We're particularly keen to hear how GOP lawmakers respond to the ongoing scrutiny facing the Pentagon, after reports that the defense secretary ordered officials to kill the survivors of an initial strike on a suspected drug-trafficking boat.

Following on from my last post, my colleague Maanvi Singh has been reporting on how asylum seekers in the US are contending with the move from the Trump administration to pause asylum decisions indefinitely.

She notes that the new rules could affect nearly 1.5m pending asylum cases with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

Legal experts expect that the broader asylum pause and other policy changes will face challenges in court. Advocates have warned that the administration's policy announcements targeting refugees, asylum seekers and specifically Afghan nationals, after last week's shooting, amount to collective punishment.

Read Maanvi's full report below:

The Department of Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem, has called for a sweeping and vague “full travel ban” on “every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies”.

Following last week's shooting in Washington DC, that killed one member of the West Virginia national guard, and left another critically wounded, the Trump administration paused all asylum decisions. The suspect is a 29-year-old Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who entered the country through a Biden-era resettlement program after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. His asylum claim was ultimately approved after Trump returned to office.

The White House has, however, blamed the previous administration for the “original sin” that allowed Lakanwal to move to the US in the first place.

In a Monday post on X, Noem said that she had spoken with the president, but was not clear about which countries should be included in a travel ban.

“Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom,” she wrote. “Not for foreign invaders to slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to AMERICANS. WE DON'T WANT THEM. NOT ONE.”

Donald Trump has accused officials in Honduras of “trying to change” the result of the country's presidential election, as the release of vote counts was paused with two rightwing candidates locked in a technical tie.

The virtual vote count had been slow and unstable before it was interrupted around midday on Monday. The electoral court said a technical problem was to blame and insisted the manual count was continuing.

On his social network, Trump accused officials of “trying to change the results” and warned that “if they do, there will be hell to pay!”.

It was the latest in a string of dramatic interventions by the US president. Before the vote, Trump had thrown his support behind Nasry “Tito” Asfura – who on Monday was ahead of his rival, Salvador Nasralla, by just 515 votes – saying that US support for the country was conditional on an Asfura victory.

He also made the extraordinary pledge to pardon Asfura's ally, the former president Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking in a New York court last year and sentenced to 45 years in prison for allegedly creating “a cocaine superhighway to the United States”.

As election officials pleaded for patience on Tuesday, Hernández's wife, Ana García de Hernández, disclosed that the former president had been released from a US prison.

Today, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to meet with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. He'll be joined by the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

The meeting comes after a US delegation – which included secretary of state Marco Rubio – held “productive” talks with Ukrainian negotiators in Florida over the weekend. On Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration “feels very optimistic” about the prospect of peace.

My colleague, Jakub Krupa, is covering the latest, including Volodymyr Zelenskyy's trip to Dublin, where the Ukrainian leader is holding a press conference with Ireland's prime minister Micheál Martin. 

Today, Zelenskyy said “now, more than ever, there is a chance to end this war”. He added that the latest peace plan draft has 20 points, that have been worked on in Geneva and Florida.

But “some things still need to be worked out,” he said.

Per my last post, it's worth noting that Michael Dell, the billionaire founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, and his wife, Susan, will donate $6.25bn dollars to the “Trump accounts” scheme, resulting in $250 deposits for roughly 25 million American children.

This contribution is designed to help children 10 or younger, who were born before 2025. It will be available for families who live in zip codes where the median household income is $150,000 or less.

“We know that when children have accounts like this, they're much more likely to graduate from high school, from college, buy a home, start a business and less likely to be incarcerated,” Dell told CNBC in an interview.

Donald Trump is in Washington today, and due to hold his ninth cabinet meeting, since returning to the White House this year.

That's due to start at 11:30am ET, and we'll bring you the latest updates.

Then, the president will make an announcement at 2pm ET, which – according to press secretary Karoline Leavitt – will be about the so-called “Trump accounts”.

A reminder that these are tax-free investment accounts for children under the age of 18 in the US who have a social security number.

The administration has promised a $1,000 seed contribution for those born between 2025 and 2028, whose parents open an account.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Russian president says European demands ‘not acceptable' as key talks begin in Moscow with Witkoff and Kushner

Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates

Vladimir Putin has accused Europe of standing in the way of US efforts to end the war in Ukraine, as he began key talks in the Kremlin with Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, and the US president's son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Witkoff, on his sixth trip to Moscow this year, is to present Putin with an updated version of a US peace proposal drafted with input from a senior Russian official and reworked to make it more acceptable to Kyiv. Images released through Russian state media showed the two delegations sat on opposite sides of an oval white table.

Moments before the closed-door meeting with Witkoff and Kushner, Putin made a series of hard-edged remarks. Speaking to reporters at the Kremlin, he accused European governments of sabotaging the peace process and said that “European demands” on ending the war in Ukraine were “not acceptable to Russia”.

“Europe is preventing the US administration from achieving peace on Ukraine,” Putin said, adding: “Russia does not intend to fight Europe, but if Europe starts, we are ready right now.”

Putin did not clarify which European demands he found unacceptable.

“They are on the side of war,” Putin said of European powers.

The two Trump allies arrived in Moscow on Tuesday after meeting Ukrainian officials at the weekend in Florida to discuss revisions to the original 28-point peace plan, which overwhelmingly favoured Moscow.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on a diplomatic push to rally support among European capitals that have backed changes to the original plan, said in Paris that the updated version of the proposal “looks better” but emphasised it was “not over yet”.

Zelenskyy has objected, in particular, to provisions in the 28-point plan that would have required Ukraine to surrender territory in the east that it currently controls, and impose limits on the size of its military. He has also demanded clear, enforceable security guarantees from the west to prevent a future Russian invasion.

Putin, for his part, has said that only the original US proposal could serve as a basis for further talks, while also stating that it required significant revisions.

Despite intense shuttle diplomacy in recent weeks, which has produced several revisions to the US peace plan, bridging the gap remains difficult: Russia's maximalist demands in effect require Ukraine's capitulation.

Trump said in remarks to a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that the Ukraine war was a “mess” and not an easy situation to resolve.

Most analysts believe the Kremlin is unlikely to accept substantial changes to the original document, casting doubt on the prospects of real progress in the talks.

But Putin's comments appeared aimed at driving a wedge between Washington and European capitals. European officials have had some success in pushing back against the original US plan, though it remains unclear to what extent Washington is taking their concerns into account.

The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, earlier on Tuesday said Putin and Witkoff would discuss the “understandings” reached recently between Washington and Kyiv, adding that Russia remained open to talks but would insist on achieving the goals of its “special operation”.

Those goals amount to sweeping demands that would severely erode Ukraine's sovereignty, including deep cuts to its armed forces, a ban on western military assistance, far-reaching limits on political independence, and the handover of Ukrainian-controlled territory in the east of the country.

On the eve of the talks with the US delegation in Moscow, Putin claimed Russian forces had taken control of the strategic city of Pokrovsk in Ukraine.

Dressed in military fatigues during a visit to a command centre on Monday evening, the Russian president hailed what he called the “important” capture of Pokrovsk, once a major logistical hub for the Ukrainian army, though Ukrainian officials later disputed the claim.

Russia has spent more than a year attempting to seize the frontline hub, seen as a gateway to Donetsk, and has suffered heavy losses in the process.

Ukrainian analysts and military bloggers have acknowledged that Russia now holds most of Pokrovsk, with battlefield maps showing its forces largely in control.

Buoyed up by recent gains at the front, Putin has indicated in recent weeks that the Russian military was prepared to keep fighting if diplomacy faltered, repeatedly emphasising that his forces remained on the offensive on the battlefield.

The Russian leader also on Tuesday threatened retaliation against Ukraine's ports and shipping after Kyiv in recent days struck several vessels in Russia's so-called shadow fleet in the Black Sea.

The Russian president threatened that Moscow would “step up strikes on Ukrainian ports and on any ships entering them” in response to attacks on Russian tankers, which he described as “piracy”.

Echoing the Kremlin, Russian state media on Tuesday struck a confident tone before the US visit. Komsomolskaya Pravda, often described as “Putin's favourite newspaper”, wrote that the president's remarks suggested “more and more Ukrainian territory is coming under our control – and that next time Russia's terms may be tougher”.

The paper implied that Moscow viewed the latest US-Ukrainian talks as a dead end, claiming Kyiv was refusing to capitulate: “The US has tried for the third time in the past 10 days to pressure Ukraine, and Washington has once again failed,” it wrote.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Monday urged young people to sign up for its New Generation National Strategic Talent Empowerment Workshop, as party officials outlined plans to train new talent to serve in the fields of international geopolitics and national security.

“Politics is everybody's business,” DPP Secretary-General Hsu Kuo-yung (徐國勇) said, quoting Sun Yat-sen (孫逸仙), a founder of the Republic of China.

“All Taiwanese, especially the younger generation, should concern themselves with politics,” Hsu said.

“Everything in the government and national affairs revolves around politics, and the DPP is the party most willing to allow young people to participate, he said, adding that it has put in a lot of effort to cultivate new talent to serve in politics.”

“The workshop aims to teach young people more about Taiwan, to love the country, forge a connection to the homeland, and advocate peace, democracy and economic prosperity for the nation,” he said.

“Taiwan is at the most strategic position in the first island chain,” Hsu said.

“It faces China, which threatens it with military invasion. So we need young people to work together to safeguard the homeland and devise national strategic concepts,” he added.

“The workshop would teach about international situations and how China has been conducting campaigns on many fronts, including cognitive warfare, legal warfare, psychological operations and propaganda and cyberwarfare,” Hsu said.

The four-day New Generation National Strategic Talent Empowerment Workshop would take place at a hotel in Taipei from Jan. 8 to 11, he said.

DPP China Affairs Director Wu Jun-zhi (吳峻鋕) said the workshop would include programs simulating new political and economic situations, as well as computer models of how the government might impose new policies and regulations.

People who are interested can sign up via the DPP's Facebook page or its China Affairs Department by Dec. 14, Wu said, adding that spaces are limited to 24.

The People's Republic of China (PRC) has never ruled Taiwan, and the PRC and the Republic of China (ROC, Taiwan) are not subordinate to each other, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said yesterday, in response to China's rejection of the Treaty of San Francisco.

Department of Treaty and Legal Affairs Director-General Andrew Lee (李憲章) made the remark in response to media queries for comment on Beijing's rejection of the treaty.

Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remark on Nov. 7 about a hypothetical Taiwan contingency potentially putting Japan in a “survival-threatening situation” has sparked anger in China. Beijing has pressured her to retract her remarks, which she has resisted.

On Wednesday last week, Takaichi said in the Diet that Japan, having renounced all rights and claims under the Treaty of San Francisco, was not in a position to comment on Taiwan's legal status.

Asked to comment on Takaichi's remark, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Guo Jiakun (郭嘉昆) on Thursday last week said that she had “singularly brought up the illegal and invalid Treaty of San Francisco ... once again showing that the prime minister remains unwilling to own up to the wrongdoing and turn back from the erroneous course.”

Asked to elaborate on Guo's remark, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning (毛寧) the next day said that “China has never recognized anything set out in the Treaty of San Francisco, including on sovereignty over Taiwan or the handling of the territory and the sovereign rights of China as a non-signatory.”

“Beijing has never accepted the treaty,” Mao added.

The ROC government's stance on the issue is consistent — “the PRC and the ROC are not subordinate to each other, which is the political status quo and an objective fact,” Lee said yesterday, adding that “the PRC cannot represent Taiwan in international society.”

“Regarding the Treaty of San Francisco, after World War II, the treaty replaced the Potsdam Proclamation and the Cairo Declaration, which were political statements,” he said.

“Therefore, the PRC has never, not even for a day, ruled or governed Taiwan, he said, adding that it was a historical fact.

Only the government democratically elected by the 23 million people of Taiwan can represent ROC, Taiwan on the international stage, Lee said.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Dec. 1 that Russian troops had captured the Ukrainian cities of Pokrovsk and Vovchansk.

The chief of the General Staff of the Russian army, Valery Gerasimov, issued a front-line report to Putin on Nov. 30, alleging that Russia had gained full control of both Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast and Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast. 

Putin then announced Russia's capture of the cities in an address published to the Russian Presidential Office website on Dec. 1. 

The same evening, Russia's Defense Ministry published a video of soldiers from the ""Center"" military unit holding up a Russian flag in the center of town, surrounded by buildings destroyed by shelling. 

On Dec. 2, Ukrainian officials refuted Russia's claims of having taken Pokrovsk, Vovchansk or Kupiansk. The General Staff wrote on Telegram that ""This is just another attempt by the Kremlin to use the videotaped 'flag op' for propaganda purposes to influence participants in international negotiations.""

""In Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, the defense forces are holding the northern part of the city along the railway line,"" the General Staff continued, reporting that Ukrainian forces have killed 106 Russian soldiers over the preceding 24 hours. 

The General Staff wrote in an earlier post the same morning that over the past day ""on the Pokrovsk front our defenders have stopped 72 assault actions of the aggressor.""

Putin's claim comes as an American delegation led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow for further negotiations on a plan to end the war in Ukraine. The plan, originally developed by Witkoff in close collaboration with the Kremlin, has been revised after talks with Ukrainian and European leaders to better reflect Kyiv's position. 

These alleged territorial gains, announced just in time for the U.S. delegation's visit, would represent key victories for the Kremlin, which has sustained severe losses in its year-long attempt to seize Pokrovsk. 

Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, warned that Moscow would escalate propaganda claims during peace negotiations. 

""Over the next few weeks, the Russians will make many attempts to exert pressure on the front line and accompany this with loud statements — all of this is done exclusively for Western audiences and to raise the stakes in diplomacy,"" Kovalenko said on Dec. 1.

Kovalenko also claimed that ""part of Vovchansk is under the control of Ukrainian Defense Forces,"" though he did not say anything about Pokrovsk. 

The fortress city of Pokrovsk has long been one of the most hotly contested areas of the front line, with Ukrainian troops holding off a major Russian assault for a year. In recent weeks, Russian troops have closed in, leaving Ukraine in control of an increasingly smaller pocket of the town. 

Vovchansk in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv Oblast has also suffered intense destruction throughout Russia's full-scale war. The city endured a Russian occupation until it was liberated in the 2022 autumn Ukrainian counter-offensive, then later saw heavy fighting again after Russia began a new push in May 2024.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Witkoff will present Putin with the latest version of the U.S.-Ukraine framework drafted during recent rounds of talks in Geneva and Florida.



Russian President Vladimir Putin said Europe ""has no peaceful agenda"" and ""is on the side of war"" just before meeting U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.





A Russian oil tanker reportedly came under a drone attack in the Black Sea while en route to a port in northern Turkey on Dec. 2, according to Turkish authorities.

""Ukraine approaches all diplomatic efforts with utmost seriousness – we are committed to achieving a real peace and guaranteed security,"" Zelensky said.

According to Ukraine's national ""Children of War"" database, at least 19,546 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and taken to Russia or Russian-controlled areas since February 2022.

""All of this is done exclusively for Western audiences and to raise the stakes in diplomacy,"" said Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation. 

The latest incident occurred on Nov. 30, when Vilnius International Airport suspended operations after unidentified objects — believed to be balloons — appeared in nearby airspace. 

Russian forces captured about 505 square kilometers (195 square miles) of Ukrainian territory in November, almost twice the gains recorded in September, DeepState said in an assessment Dec. 1. 

""The informational 'victories' that the Russian Defense Ministry  announces daily on paper have nothing to do with the real situation on the front lines,"" Ukraine's 11th Army Corps said. 

A Ukrainian deep-strike unit hit a Russian ""storage and launch area"" for Shahed-type drones near Cape Chauda, Crimea, overnight on Nov. 28, the Special Operations Forces said.

Hello, this is Chris York, reporting from Kyiv on day 1,378 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

While the international focus remains on Trump's peace deal negotiations in Moscow, our focus in this blog is on updates from the front:

Our top story so far:

Drones launched by Ukraine's military intelligence struck Russian air defense systems in occupied Donbas, the agency claimed on Dec. 2, knocking out a launcher from a S-300 SAM system, and two 1L125 Niobium-SV radar stations.

""Such strikes significantly reduce the ability of Muscovites to control the airspace over Donbas and create conditions for new air operations of the Defense Forces of Ukraine,"" HUR said in a post on Telegram.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report.

Last updated 6:46 p.m. Kyiv time.

Ukraine expects up to $16 billion of U.S. weapons in 2026, provided under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), Aliona Hetmanchuk, the head of Ukraine's mission to NATO said on Dec. 2.

The PURL initiative, launched earlier this year, enables NATO allies to buy advanced U.S. weaponry for Ukraine.

""It is very important for us that the end of 2025 does not become the end of the program. Next year, we expect to ensure the supply of American weapons worth $12 to $16 billion,"" Hetmanchuk said in comments reported by Ukrainska Pravda.

Last updated 2:21 p.m. Kyiv time.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained British citizen Ross David Cutmore, who came to Ukraine as a military instructor, on suspicion of working for Russian intelligence, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 2.

The security agency announced Cutmore's detention on Oct. 29 without disclosing his name at the time, presenting him as a ""former military instructor"" from Europe who was covertly working for Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) from Kyiv.

A number of foreign veterans have flocked to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022 to serve as instructors or volunteers in the Ukrainian military.

Cutmore, reportedly a former British soldier who was deployed in the Middle East, arrived in Ukraine in early 2024 to train Ukrainian soldiers in the use of firearms and tactical skills.

Several months later, the military trainer left the job and reached out to Russian intelligence services with an offer of collaboration, seeking ""easy money,"" the SBU said in October.

According to the investigation, Cutmore was passing information on Ukraine's military to Russia and was plotting unspecified ""terrorist attacks."" The suspect is in custody and faces up to 12 years in prison.

Last updated 1:47 p.m. Kyiv time.

A Russian oil tanker reportedly came under a drone attack in the Black Sea while en route to a port in northern Turkey on Dec. 2, according to Turkish authorities.

""The tanker MIDVOLGA-2, carrying sunflower oil from Russia to Georgia, reported being attacked 80 miles off our coast,"" the Turkish Transport Ministry wrote on X on Dec. 2. ""Currently, there are no casualties among the 13 crew members, and the vessel has not requested assistance. The ship is proceeding toward Sinop under its own power.""

According to Marine Traffic, an online ship-tracking platform, the Midvolga-2 is an oil and chemical tanker just under 140 meters long and sails under the Russian flag.

Citing unnamed Turkish officials, Bloomberg reported that the Midvolga-2 was struck by sea drones.

Eighty miles would be outside Turkey's territorial waters but well within its Exclusive Economic Zone.

There has been no confirmation or even official mention of Ukraine in connection to the attack on the Midvolga-2, but it follows a series of recent Ukrainian strikes on Russia's “shadow fleet” — vessels that skirt sanctions to sell Russian fossil fuels abroad. These strikes have typically used “Sea Baby” naval drones.

At least six people were killed and 24 others injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine from the evening of Nov. 30 to the morning of Dec. 1, according to authorities.

Ukraine's Air Force said Dec. 1 that Russia launched 62 strike drones of various types, including Shahed-type drones, from several directions in Russia and occupied Crimea. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 39 of them, while 20 drones hit eight locations.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a Russian ballistic missile struck Dnipro industrial area on Dec. 1, killing four people and injuring 45 others, local authorities said. A further two people were injured in drone strikes later in the day.

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, one person was killed and three injured, Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.

In Sumy Oblast, one person was killed and another injured when a drone struck a car in the Bilopil community, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration said.

In Kharkiv Oblast, six civilians were injured as Russian forces attacked six settlements over the past day, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram.

In Kherson Oblast, 13 people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Telegram.

Russia has lost about 1,173,920 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Dec. 1.

The figure includes 1,110 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day, according to the report.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,387 tanks, 23,679 armored fighting vehicles, 68,641 vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,768 artillery systems, 1,552 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,253 air defense systems, 430 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 86,141 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares.  Help us reach 25,000 members by the end of 2025.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Dec. 2 that Moscow is prepared for a war with Europe ""right now"" if European states initiate one, delivering the remarks moments before meeting U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.

""If Europe starts a war, we are ready right now,"" the Russian president said.

Putin's comments came as Washington intensifies diplomatic outreach aimed at advancing negotiations to end Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. 

The Russian president claimed that European governments obstruct U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to reach a settlement and ""live under illusions"" of imposing a strategic defeat on Russia.

Putin also said Europe ""has no peaceful agenda"" and ""is on the side of war,"" citing military support for Ukraine and the crafting of peace proposals less favorable to Russia as evidence of hostility.

""When they supposedly try to make changes to Trump's proposals… all these changes are aimed at only one thing: to completely block the entire peace process,"" the Russian president added.

The remarks echoed Moscow's broader messaging as Russia expands hybrid pressure on Europe.

European states have recorded a surge of suspected Russian-linked activities in recent years, including cyberattacks, sabotage attempts, and repeated damage to underwater infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.  

The incidents intensified in early autumn as unidentified drones and Russian aircraft repeatedly crossed into or approached NATO airspace.

In September, Polish forces shot down several Russian drones that entered Polish territory. Days later, a Russian drone breached Romanian airspace, though Bucharest did not engage. 

On Sept. 19, three Russian MiG-31 fighters crossed into Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes, prompting Tallinn to activate consultations under NATO's Article 4.

Belgium also reported a series of drone incidents near critical infrastructure. Belgian authorities said three drones flew over the Doel Nuclear Power Plant on Nov. 9, while several unidentified drones were spotted near sensitive sites in the days that followed.

Putin's latest warning added pressure to European capitals already concerned about Russia's increasing willingness to test air defenses and target infrastructure across the continent.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Witkoff will present Putin with the latest version of the U.S.-Ukraine framework drafted during recent rounds of talks in Geneva and Florida.



Russian President Vladimir Putin said Europe ""has no peaceful agenda"" and ""is on the side of war"" just before meeting U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.





A Russian oil tanker reportedly came under a drone attack in the Black Sea while en route to a port in northern Turkey on Dec. 2, according to Turkish authorities. 

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained British citizen Ross David Cutmore, who came to Ukraine as a military instructor, on suspicion of working for Russian intelligence, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 2.

""Ukraine approaches all diplomatic efforts with utmost seriousness – we are committed to achieving a real peace and guaranteed security,"" Zelensky said.

According to Ukraine's national ""Children of War"" database, at least 19,546 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and taken to Russia or Russian-controlled areas since February 2022.

""All of this is done exclusively for Western audiences and to raise the stakes in diplomacy,"" said Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation. 

The latest incident occurred on Nov. 30, when Vilnius International Airport suspended operations after unidentified objects — believed to be balloons — appeared in nearby airspace. 

Russian forces captured about 505 square kilometers (195 square miles) of Ukrainian territory in November, almost twice the gains recorded in September, DeepState said in an assessment Dec. 1. 

""The informational 'victories' that the Russian Defense Ministry  announces daily on paper have nothing to do with the real situation on the front lines,"" Ukraine's 11th Army Corps said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kyiv's European allies Tuesday of sabotaging U.S.-led efforts to end the nearly four-year-old war in Ukraine.

“They don't have a peace agenda, they're on the side of the war,” Putin said after speaking to an investment forum and before he met in the Kremlin with a U.S. delegation led by envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Putin's accusations appeared to be his latest attempt to sow dissension between Trump and European countries and set the stage for exempting Moscow from blame for any lack of progress.

He accused Europe of amending peace proposals with “demands that are absolutely unacceptable to Russia,” thus “blocking the entire peace process,” only to blame Russia for it. “That's their goal,” Putin said.

He reiterated his long-held position that Russia has no plans to attack Europe – a concern regularly voiced by some European countries.

“But if Europe suddenly wants to wage a war with us and starts it, we are ready right away. There can be no doubt about that,” Putin said.

 

The Associated Press

Russia started the war in 2022 with its full-scale invasion of a sovereign European country, and European governments have since spent many billions of dollars to support Ukraine financially and militarily, to wean themselves from energy dependence on Russia and to strengthen their own militaries to try to deter Moscow from seizing more territory by force.

They worry that if Russia gets what it wants in Ukraine, it will have free rein to threaten or disrupt other European countries, which already have faced incursions from Russian drones and fighter jets, and an alleged widespread Russian sabotage campaign. 

Drone war in Russia leaves soldiers wary of the skies and civilians weary on the ground

Trump's peace plan relies on Europe to provide the bulk of the financing and security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, even though no Europeans appear to have been consulted on the original plan. That's why European governments have pushed to ensure that peace efforts address European concerns, too.

Speaking with Putin via a translator before the talks, Witkoff said he and Kushner had taken “a beautiful walk” around Moscow and described it as a “magnificent city.”

Coinciding with Witkoff's trip to Moscow, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky went to Ireland, continuing his visits to European countries that have helped sustain his country's fight against Russia's invasion.

In what could be a high-stakes day of negotiations, Zelensky said he was expecting swift reports later in the day from the U.S. envoys in Moscow on whether talks could move forward, after Trump's initial 28-point plan was whittled down to 20 in Sunday's talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Florida.

“They want to report right after that meeting to us, specifically. The future and the next steps depend on these signals. Such steps will change throughout today, even hour by hour, I believe,” Zelensky said at a news conference in Dublin with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin.

“If the signals show fair play with our partners, we then might meet very soon, meet with the American delegation,” he said.

“There is a lot of dialogue, but we need results. Our people are dying every day,” Zelenskyy said. “I am ready ... to meet with President Trump. It all depends on today's talks.”

After months of frustration in his efforts to stop the fighting, Trump deployed officials to get traction for his peace proposals. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin's talks with Witkoff and Kushner would take “as long as needed.”

The talks have followed parallel lines so far, with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio sitting down with Ukrainian officials.

Zelensky said he met Tuesday with the Ukrainian delegation that returned from the negotiations with U.S. representatives in Florida. Rubio said those talks made progress, but added that “there's more work to be done.” 

Analysis: Duelling peace plans show relief for Ukraine remains a long way off

Zelensky said the Florida talks took as their cue a document that both sides drafted at an earlier meeting in Geneva. The Ukrainian leader said that document was now “finalized,” although he didn't explain what that meant.

Ukrainian diplomats are working to ensure that European partners are “substantially involved” in decision-making, Zelensky said on the Telegram messaging app, and warned about what he said were Russian disinformation campaigns aimed at steering the negotiations.

“Ukrainian intelligence will provide partners with the information we have about Russia's true intentions and its attempts to use diplomatic efforts as cover to ease sanctions and block important collective European decisions,” Zelensky said.

Zelensky met with political leaders and lawmakers in Dublin on his first official visit. Ireland is officially neutral and isn't a member of NATO but has sent nonlethal military support to Ukraine. More than 100,000 Ukrainians have moved to Ireland since Russia launched its war on Feb. 24, 2022.

Though this week's consultations could move the process forward, few details have become public. It remains unclear how envoys are going to bridge the gap between the two sides on such basic differences as who keeps what territory. European officials say the road to peace will be long.

European leaders are trying to figure out how they can make their voices heard after being largely sidelined by Washington. They are also working on future security guarantees for Ukraine.

U.S.-Ukraine talks ‘productive,' but more work needed to reach peace deal, Rubio says

Zelensky was in Paris on Monday, and French President Emmanuel Macron said they spoke by phone with Witkoff. They also spoke to leaders of eight other European countries as well as top European Union officials and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.

Macron said the coming days will see “crucial discussions” between U.S. officials and Western partners. Zelensky's visit to Paris followed Sunday's meeting between Ukrainian and U.S. officials, which Rubio described as productive.

Diplomats face a hard time trying to bridge Russian and Ukrainian differences and persuading them to strike compromises. The key obstacles – over whether Kyiv should cede land to Moscow and how to ensure Ukraine's future security – appear unresolved.

 

The Associated Press

Zelensky is under severe pressure in one of the darkest periods of the war for his country. As well as managing diplomatic pressure, he must find money to keep Ukraine afloat, address a corruption scandal that has reached the top echelons of his government, and keep Russia at bay on the battlefield.

The Kremlin late Monday claimed that Russian forces have captured the key city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. Zelensky, however, said in Paris that fighting was still ongoing in Pokrovsk on Monday.

Ukraine's general staff on Tuesday also denied Russia's claims to have captured Pokrovsk, saying it was a propaganda stunt. The Ukrainian army is readying additional logistic routes to deliver supplies to troops in the area, the Facebook post said.

American figure skater Andrew Torgashev was at an invitation-only camp organized by U.S. Figure Skating not long ago, a chance for elite athletes preparing for the high-level Grand Prix season to work out any flaws in their performances.

He tried a quad toe loop, a four-revolution jump where skaters launch from the back outside edge of their blade with the help of a toe pick from the other foot. The jump itself is the easiest of skating's six primary jumps, but four revolutions ups the difficulty.

To the naked eye, Torgashev landed it perfectly. To the camera watching him, Torgashev landed a quarter-revolution short.

It was a small error, to be sure, but the kind that could make the difference in whether Torgashev medals in a sport where tenths and even hundredths of a point matter. And he knew instantly thanks to feedback he received from the camera – or, more accurately, the app it was running, designed by a pair of computer whiz kids with no background in skating, but who saw in the sport a chance to not only help athletes in training but perhaps someday assist in the actual scoring of competitions.

The app is called OOFSkate, and powered by AI technology it analyzes from a tablet or mobile phone a skater's jump height, rotation speed, airtime and even landing quality. It provides skaters with feedback without having to wear sensors or other technology.

“Our vision for the system is to automate the technical calling of the sport,” said Jerry Lu, who along with his old college roommate, Jacob Blindenbach, have built out the system. “This manifests itself in a combination of using AI-assisted computer vision, but also the knowledge of figure skating, essentially taking out the stuff that should be judged without subjectivity.”

In other words, let humans judge the artistic side of the sport. Let computers handle the technical stuff.

“What are the things that go into a particular jump? We're trying to measure those things as a semi-automated technical assistant,” Lu told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of this week's Grand Prix Final, one of the premier events in the sport. “But also, it's a coaching tool that teachers around the country can use to evaluate their own athletes.”

The system itself seems remarkably simple: It uses a phone or tablet camera to capture a skater in motion, then overlays the key points of a jump or spin – the idealized version of a given element – and records the metrics that technical panels typically use.

Instantly, a coach or judge can know whether a skater completed three full turns of a triple lutz, or landed on the correct blade edge for a salchow. They can know how high the skater jumped, which is one of the judging criteria, and how fast they were spinning.

It also helps the individual skater, who can marry the jump they have just done in practice against what they may have done in the past, or even compare the way they are performing any given element against the way the best have performed it.

In the case of U.S. Figure Skating, a team library will allow them to compare their skills to benchmark data collected over the years.

“So if I'm Andrew Torgashev and I'm at Champs Camp,” Lu said, “I can do a quad toe loop and can compare it against myself, along with all the other athletes that have executed this. ‘Am I spinning as well as Mikhail Shaidorov? Or a previous version of myself?'”

Lu and Blindenbach met while studying at the University of Virginia, where both were swimmers. They were drawn to ways emerging technology could help athletes in the water, such as accelerometers that better measure an athlete's performance.

They went separate ways upon graduation, Lu to the MIT Sports Lab in Massachusetts and Blindenbach to Columbia in New York to specialize in artificial intelligence. But they stayed in touch, thinking up ways they could implement technology in other sports.

“We thought this would be a way to push the Olympic sports we love,” Blindenbach said.

It was NBC, which has the broadcast rights to the Summer and Winter Games in the U.S., that ultimately brought the pair into the figure skating world. The network asked them to conceive of some kind of technology that could help its analysts, former Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir, with providing their commentary in real time.

U.S. Figure Skating got on board with the project, realizing its potential to help train its high-level athletes. Olympic skaters Jason Brown and Alysa Liu, along with her coach, Massimo Scali, have provided feedback. And almost weekly, Lu or Blindenbach head to the revered Skating Club of Boston, where they are able to put the latest iteration of their system to the test.

It could be a revolutionary moment in a sport that often changes at a glacial pace.

“At least from what I can tell, they all seem very open,” Lu said. “They love the sport, first of all. Whatever we can do to help the sport grow and become better, they would do. They are very inclusive of us being there, and shadowing them throughout the day. How do they train, how do they interact with coaches? It's an artistic sport but it's also an athletic sport.”

The name OOFSkate originally came from what skaters tend to say after seeing their feedback from a jump — as in, “Oof, that wasn't very good!” Then, one of the folks at U.S. Figure Skating gave it a second meaning: “Obsessed over form.”

Indeed, the ability of OOFSkate to take the subjectivity out of judging form is intriguing, much like similar technology has taken the subjectivity out of line calls in tennis, and promises to take the same subjectivity out of balls and strikes in baseball.

“If someone under-rotates,” Blindenbach explained, “that should always be called. There shouldn't be a missed call or a controversy because something doesn't play out. Sometimes a position makes it hard (for a judge) to see if they're on an edge or off an edge on a lutz or a flip. We hope that AI can make the sport more fair.”

Lu and Blindenbach are wary about looking too far ahead, though. Hawk-Eye, the system that uses high-speed cameras to track the flight of tennis balls and determine whether they land inbounds or out, was pioneered in the early 2000s, and just this past year did the All-England Club decide to replace human line judges with the system at Wimbledon.

When it comes to the Olympics, the fact that Omega is its official data provider provides another obstacle in implementation.

So given the slow pace of technological adoption, Lu and Blindenbach are focused for now on fine-tuning the system to help coaches, athletes and commentators better do their jobs, especially as many prepare for the Milan Cortina Olympics in February.

“We don't want to step on toes,” Blindenbach said. “When you go fully AI and take the human out of the loop, people generally get mad, and the results are poor. We want to assist. If that's jump height or rotation, or if someone under-rotates by a quarter, these are easy things to do with AI, relatively speaking, compared to trying to capture something artistic. That's where we see ourselves.”

Ontario's Auditor-General says the province isn't auditing doctors whose billings raise obvious red flags, including 82 doctors who claimed to have worked 24 hours or more in a single day, a diagnostic radiologist who billed for an average of 461 patients a day, and an ophthalmologist who billed $6.7-million in one year, more than twice as much as the next highest biller in the specialty.

The same unnamed ophthalmologist has been investigated three times for allegedly charging patients out-of-pocket fees for services that should be free through the Ontario Health Insurance Plan. The first review found the doctor wrongly charged patients, a second cleared the ophthalmologist, and a third is ongoing.

When the Ontario Ministry of Health does identify inappropriate billings, it often negotiates settlements that allow doctors to repay less than what they overbilled, Ontario Auditor-General Shelley Spence found in her annual report, released Tuesday.

“Not recovering overpayments from physicians represents a waste of taxpayer's money,” the report said. “Stronger payment recovery mechanisms would enable the Ministry to use taxpayer funds more effectively and efficiently, including the possibility of directing those recovered funds to providing more patient care.” 

Ontario has more family doctors, but fewer are working in primary care, study shows

The Auditor-General noted there hasn't been much improvement in the oversight of physician billings since her office last flagged the problem in a 2016 audit. 

In response, the Ministry of Health approved 22 additional positions for that purpose, but, according to the new report, “the Ministry permanently reallocated 17 to other areas and assigned the remaining five to areas outside of the audit function.” 

Health care was a major focus of Ms. Spence's annual report. Along with scrutinizing physician billings, she also investigated the Progressive Conservative government's oversight of primary care and of medical education in family medicine. 

Ontario Premier Doug Ford has vowed that every Ontarian will be attached to a primary-care physician or nurse practitioner by 2029. Last year he appointed former federal health minister Jane Philpott to lead a Primary Care Action Team to enact that promise. 

The Auditor-General's report, citing a network of primary-care researchers called INSPIRE-PHC, says that about two million Ontarians didn't have a family doctor as of March, 2024, up from 1.8 million in 2020. 

Opinion: Allowing doctors to practise in both public and private systems solves what exactly?

The report identifies several barriers to finding doctors for many patients. It concludes that the province's Health Care Connect service, which is supposed to match patients in need with available doctors, has in recent years left patients languishing in the queue for too long. 

Of the approximately 178,000 people who registered with Health Care Connect between 2020-2021 and 2024-2025 and who were still waiting to be referred to a physician as of June, more than 108,000 had been waiting for more than a year. 

The Auditor-General also found that only 7 per cent of family doctors working in a payment model that sees them formally enroll patients were willing to take patients off the Health Care Connect waiting list. 

Dr. Philpott and her team have in the past year made a concerted effort to tackle the Health Care Connect waiting list, Ontario Health Minister Sylvia Jones has said. In October, her office reported that the Primary Care Action Team was halfway to its goal of clearing the approximately 235,000 names that were on the provincial waiting list as of Jan. 1, 2025 by next spring. 

In a separate audit, the Auditor-General scrutinized the Ford government's plan to expand medical school seats for future family doctors, including by opening two new medical schools at Toronto Metropolitan and York universities. 

Ontario to expand funding for primary health-care teams based on initial success

Ms. Spence and her team concluded the government failed to heed warnings from the leaders of existing medical schools that there were not enough family medicine clinics in the province with the capacity to teach medical residents. For that reason, by the end of this academic year, the Ministry of Health will have rolled out 44 per cent fewer family medicine seats than originally planned, according to the report. 

As part of the physician billing audit, Ms. Spence and her office also looked at how often doctors inappropriately charge patients fees for services that are supposed to be covered by OHIP.

The Ministry of Health has conducted 452 reviews since 2020 under a law called the Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act, 83 per cent of which were related to alleged patient billing violations. About a third of those were for eye procedures, including cataract surgeries. 

“We previously raised this issue in our 2021 audit of Outpatient Surgeries, which found no provincial oversight to protect patients against inappropriate charges for OHIP-funded services or physicians that may mislead and charge patients for unnecessary add-ons,” the new report says. 

The Ontario government has trumpeted its plans to offer more procedures, including cataract surgeries and, eventually, hip and knee surgeries, in private clinics as a way to reduce waiting times.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","World Cup 2026 draw: Trump, Infantino and a peace prize","https://www.dw.com/en/world-cup-2026-draw-trump-infantino-and-a-peace-prize/a-74973736","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 12:10:30 GMT","

The draw for the 2026 World Cup is on December 5, and Donald Trump will attend and pick up FIFA's new peace prize. Is FIFA president Gianni Infantino really a ""close friend"" of Trump, or just trying to stay onside?

The eyes of the political world have been firmly fixed on Washington for the whole of 2025 and, on Friday, the eyes of the football world will join them for the 2026 World Cup draw.

Gianni Infantino, the president of world football's governing body, FIFA, will be the ringmaster. But even the most powerful man in the world's biggest sport will likely be in the shadow of US President Donald Trump despite the very public friendship the two men have formed.

""I'm really lucky. I have a great relationship with President Trump, who I consider really a close friend,"" Infantino said recently of a friendship that has also included a recent photo op with Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portugal star was subsequently given a part-suspended ban for a highly unusual red card in World Cup qualifying that would normally have seen him miss Portugal's first two tournament matches.

""Of course, he's been very, very helpful in everything we do for the World Cup,"" Infantino continued on Trump. ""He has such an incredible energy and this is something that I really admire. He does things. He does what he says. He says what he thinks. He says, actually, what many people think as well, but maybe don't dare to say.""

Given that the US will host most matches in the 2026 tournament, with a handful in neighboring Canada and Mexico, a closer working relationship between the two men is normal, according to Sylvia Schenk.

""It's all about the situation,"" Schenk, a German former Olympic runner who has worked in sports as a volunteer for Transparency International, told DW. She was also a member of FIFA's independent Human Rights Advisory Board and is an arbitrator at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) .

""If the World Cup weren't happening in the US, Trump wouldn't be bothered about Infantino. So that's the starting point. And the same other way around. Infantino needs a good tournament next year and for that he needs a working relationship with Trump.""

Schenk said that finding a balanced and stable dynamic with Trump has been beyond most world leaders, and Infantino must tread a delicate line. But she also believes the pair have similar character traits.

""They are both vain and both want to be flattered and both have a very, very, very big ego,"" said Schenk, who spent time with Infantino during her work with FIFA. She added that she has seen less interest in human rights issues from Infantino the longer he has been in power.

FIFA, under Infantino, have emphasized political neutrality, purporting to ensure an absence of political interference and a certain standard of human rights in its associations as well as banning overtly political gestures from players or coaches.

And though Infantino is required to have a relationship with Trump, his presence at the Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks with the US president was the latest in a series of appearances on the political stage which have raised eyebrows.

As has Infantino's decision to introduce a FIFA Peace Prize, to be awarded on Friday at the draw a mile from the White House. Though the recipient is not confirmed, it's not a huge leap to imagine it will go to Trump, who lost out on the much-coveted, and much longer-established Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition activist Maria Corina Machado just a few weeks before FIFA launched their version.

""The question is whether Infantino is doing too much and I think a Peace Prize would be far too much,"" said Schenk.

Trump has made a series of policy decisions, and statements that will have a bearing on the tournament. Last week, the Iranian soccer federation said they will not be sending anyone to the draw after a lack of visa guarantees for their delegates. Iran is one of several countries on Trump's travel ban list, along with fellow qualifiers Haiti. Exceptions are made for athletes and some, but apparently not all, support staff. No fans from those nations on the list will be able to travel to the US.

""The last time the FIFA president was present in the national team's dressing room was the 2025 AFC (Asian Football Confederation) final against Uzbekistan, when he announced to the Iranian players that the Iranian convoy's presence would be guaranteed from the beginning of the draw ceremony until the last day of the national team's participation in the World Cup, including workshops,"" the federation's spokesperson Amir Mehdi Alavi told Iranian outlet Tarafdari.

Such disputes threaten Infantino's high-wire act with Trump, as does the president's threat earlier in November, when he again floated moving matches away from Democrat-controlled cities. ""If we think there's going to be a sign of any trouble, I would ask [Infantino] to move that to a different city,"" Trump said.

Schenk said this kind of political situation may force Infantino to stand up to Trump, though there are no guarantees in that regard.

""I think in the end he probably has to. But if Trump one day says — in four weeks, in February or whenever — 'We will move games from Los Angeles to whatever other city' it will be very, very difficult for FIFA to say: ‘We don't accept the risk analysis of the government of the US, we think it's safe and we will stay there.' This is risky too.""

Whether Trump and Infantino's friendship is genuine, or a PR match of convenience, will likely be tested even more severely in the six months preceding the opener, in Mexico City on June 11. The International Olympic Committee will surely face similar tests when the Olympics arrive in LA in 2028.

Tens of thousands of people demonstrated against the 2026 budget and called for the government to step down in fresh protests across the Balkan nation.

Tens of thousands of people protested in Bulgaria on Monday

Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the capital, Sofia, as well as at least a dozen other cities on Monday evening in the biggest protests the Balkan country has seen for years.

In central Sofia, demonstrators packed the giant square in front of the National Assembly building. One of the rally organizers put the attendance at 50,000, according to the Bulgarian News Agency, BTA.

They chanted ""Resignation!"" and sang and danced as they waved Bulgarian and European Union flags

The protesters projected the words ""Resign"" and ""Mafia"" onto the government buildings around the square and held two large banners saying: ""Generation Z is coming"" and ""Young Bulgaria without the mafia.""  ​​

Protesters want the government to stick with its promise to withdraw the 2026 budget, which proposed steeper taxes on dividends and a hike in social security contributions.

They are also angry about public sector corruption and are calling for the resignation of the minority coalition government of Rosen Zhelyazkov.

Bulgaria, with a population of 6.4 million people, is one of the most corrupt countries in the European Union. Of the 27 EU member states, only Hungary is rated as more corrupt on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index.

""We are here to protest for our future. We want to be a European country, not one ruled by corruption and the mafia,"" Ventsislava Vasileva, a 21-year-old student, told AFP news agency.

Another protester, a 24-year-old who gave his name as Georgi, said he was protesting against ""all the arrogance"" shown by the country's leaders and ""all the lawlessness.""

The main protest in central Sofia was peaceful, according to local media reports.

But after the main rally broke up, some of the protesters clashed with police, throwing rocks, bottles and firecrackers. They also set garbage containers on fire and destroyed a police van late on Monday, according to BTA.

Groups of protesters vandalized the headquarters of the ruling party plus another party that supports the government, BTA reported.

Police retaliated with pepper spray, and at least 10 people were arrested and two police officers were injured, the agency said.

President Rumen Radev, an independent, said all violence should stop.

He also called for the government to step down.

""There is only one way out: resignation and early elections,"" Radev said on Facebook.

Bulgaria is governed by a minority coalition formed by GERB, the Bulgarian Socialist Party and There Is Such a People (ITN).

The government is expected to propose amendments to the proposed 2026 budget this week.

After mass protests erupted across Bulgaria last week, Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov promised on November 27 that his Cabinet would withdraw the draft 2026 budget and shape a new one.

Points of contention included raising social security contributions and certain taxes while increasing public sector spending.

Critics are concerned about the economic impact of the budget in a country that is the poorest in the EU.

They are also worried that greater flows to the public sector will further entrench graft.

The protests come as the Balkan country prepares to adopt the European common currency, the euro, on January 1, 2026.

The president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, warned last month that that inflation may jump when Bulgaria joins the euro zone.

EU prosecutors have detained three officials, including Italian politician Federica Mogherini. They suspect fraud in a 2021 and 2022 training program for junior diplomats and its tender process.

Former EU top diplomat Federica Mogherini was one of three suspects detained on Tuesday in police searches of the European Union's diplomatic service in Brussels and an elite university in Bruges. 

The European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) said that its fraud investigation was targeting the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the College of Europe and was related to an EU-funded training course of diplomats. 

It said that suspects' homes were searched as part of the operation, also stressing that all of them were innocent until proven guilty under Belgian law. 

The EPPO said that its investigation was focused on a ""nine-month training program for junior diplomats"" and its tender process in 2021 and 2022, which the EU's diplomatic service the EEAS had awarded to the College of Europe. 

""The investigation focuses on whether the College of Europe and/or their representatives were informed in advance about the selection criteria of the tender procedure and had sufficient reason to believe that they would be awarded the implementation of the project, prior to the official production by the EEAS of the tender notice,"" the EPPO said. 

It said there were ""strong suspicions"" that a fair competition regulation was breached, and ""that confidential information related to the ongoing procurement was shared with one of the candidates participating in the tender."" 

The facts under investigation, the EPPO said, could constitute ""procurement fraud, corruption, conflict of interest and violation of professional secrecy."" 

Federica Mogherini was the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy from 2014 to 2019. 

Prior to her time as the EU's top diplomatic representative, the 52-year-old center-left Italian politician had spent six years in Italy's parliament representing a district in Rome, Lazio I. She undertook various foreign policy-related tasks and roles in Italian politics during and before her time as a lawmaker.

Mogherini had a brief stint as Italy's foreign minister in 2014 before taking up the top foreign policy spot in Brussels later that year. 

In 2020, she was appointed the rector of the College of Europe.

She is also director of the European Union Diplomatic Academy and was in charge of the EEAS during her five years as a European Commissioner.

The College of Europe is a postgraduate university catered to training diplomats that can trace its roots back to the earliest progenitors of the European Union. 

It was founded in 1949, soon after the end of World War II, to promote ""a spirit of solidarity and mutual understanding between all the nations of Western Europe and to provide elite training to individuals who will uphold these values."" 

Its main campus is in Bruges in northern Belgium, and it also has newer campuses in Warsaw, Poland and in Tirana, Albania. 

The College of Europe's chairman is another veteran EU politician, former Belgian Prime Minister and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy.

The European External Action Service (EEAS) was established in 2010 to assist the EU's foreign policy commissioner.

It is the diplomatic service in charge of executing EU international relations on behalf of the commissioner. According to its 2024 Annual Activity Report, its budget that year was €880.2 million (roughly $1.02 billion at current exchange rates).

Finally, the EPPO is the EU's independent public prosecution office. It's responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment crimes against the financial interests of the EU.

Colonial powers are using the same playbook in both Gaza and Sudan — divide, conquer, and occupy.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

When I was a child, I used to naively invert the colors of the Palestinian flag — green in the place of red, red where black should be, and black replacing the green. Back then, I didn't realize that I was imagining an entirely different country: Sudan. Little did I know that one day both of us would be dragged into the same campaign of elimination, exposed to the same colonial ideologies, left unheeded until our erasure reached a never-returning edge.

Both of our countries have long been preyed upon for geopolitical interests. Sudan's counterrevolution broke out in April 2023, facilitated by the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and the United Kingdom — all for the sake of plundering its natural wealth and building invincible empires over its burnt ashes and spilled blood. In a world driven by power and profit rather than justice, Sudan's rich resources — including its oil and gold reserves and its strategic location for maritime trade — made its onslaught “justified” enough for colonial powers to extract its treasures.

The same hidden intentions have haunted Gaza, where the race to extract its offshore gas accelerated shortly after October 7. Reports later confirmed that this attempt was futile, yet Israel's and the U.S.'s colonial ambitions only extended further. By February 2025, President Trump openly declared his vision to turn Gaza into the “Riviera of the Middle East,” paired with the proposal of forcibly displacing its people to other countries outside of Palestine.

These are not rhetorical lapses or one-off decisions. This is the systemic playbook used by the world's dominant colonial powers to destabilize and dehumanize, and then divide, conquer, and occupy. In the lexicons of such colonial powers, the people of Gaza and Sudan are mere numbers. Our erasure will occupy the headlines for a while and then fall between the cracks of a new imperial project. Our existence stands as a deadlock before their settler-colonial regimes. Our ambitions, dreams, lives, names, and homes amount to nothing in the grinding wheel of change. That is why, in one way or another, we in Gaza are intertwined with the Sudanese people.

In the lexicons of colonial powers, the people of Gaza and Sudan are mere numbers.

As the Rapid Support Forces, a Sudanese paramilitary group, unleashed their violence on El Fasher in 2023 — bringing the city under siege, starving its people, displacing more than 2 million, maiming bodies, torturing civilians to death, and raping dozens of people — Gaza was dragged into another wave of annihilation, carried out by Israel and backed by the United States. The architects of genocide may overtly differ, but covertly they are the same, thriving on the catastrophes inflicted on marginalized nations and driving them deeper. We, Gazans, were occupied with the daily battle of survival, with barely a flinching eye spared for anything outside Gaza's borders — except Sudan's plight. We thought of the Sudanese people amid the lulls of displacement, during the hunger riots inside our stomachs, and in the ghostly tales recounted by Palestinian prisoners who were released. We felt for the people in Sudan deeply, but we were shackled, prevented from stopping their carnage while, in the meantime, we were being exterminated ourselves.

Somehow, our genocide has tragically overshadowed the Sudanese one. To some extent, the international media have seemed to give more attention to Gaza's plight than Sudan's. Yet no genocide is less than another, and no blood is worth more than another. Empathy, joint solidarity, and activism should never be conditional or selective — never based on the victim's identity, race, religion, or color.

Sudan has a long history of standing up for Palestine and supporting our unalienable right to liberation and self-determination. Back in 2020, Sudanese people marched against their own government for signing on to the Abraham Accords and normalizing ties with Israel.

The international media have seemed to give more attention to Gaza's plight than Sudan's. Yet no genocide is less than another, and no blood is worth more than another.

The fall of El Fasher into the hands of the RSF coincided with the announcement of Gaza's fragile ceasefire in October 2025. We breathed a sigh of relief that our bloodshed had come to an end and pledged not to allow it to happen again — not to us, nor to others — yet we were struck by the fact that Sudan's suffering had plunged into a graver pattern of erasure.

Decades ago, in the wake of the Holocaust, the world shouted “never again,” but this vow has been broken over and over in cruel, unfathomable ways. And when we, ourselves, cried it — “never again” — we wished it to truly mean never again.

But Sudan's counterrevolution, in which foreign powers entrench their own interests, has shattered any faint hope and exposed the moral decay that has never been repaired in the wake of Gaza's genocide — a decay that reveals how fragile the world's promise is, allowing another genocide to escalate, choosing silence over stopping the carnage time and time again.

Yet this time, it is not only the livestreamed atrocities in Gaza that are being censored, sanitized, and carefully curated to obfuscate the truth — it is also those in Sudan. I have come across hundreds, if not thousands, of videos emerging from Sudan, many of them filmed by RSF fighters themselves, documenting their newly invented methods of brutal killing and degradation. I panicked as if I were in that scene. My heart thrashed, my breath shrank, and tears streamed down. All the videos shared by Israeli forces — boasting of their ability to wreak havoc beyond repair, to torture Gazans beyond imagination, and to kill on a wholesale scale — flashed through my mind.

Other videos were pleas from Sudanese people, calling on the world's conscience, begging those in power to stop the killing and to allow the entry of medicine, food, and humanitarian supplies. I felt helpless, but responsible toward them — as we are the very ones who can truly feel them. The hunger, while loaded trucks piled up at the borders; the indifference, while our pleas relentlessly echo; and the dread overflowing from the eyes speak louder than words ever can.

Sudan is Gaza, and Gaza is Sudan; to say otherwise is to believe in the flimsy nuances that are stitched together by the same hands that planted this apartheid.

It is not only the livestreamed atrocities in Gaza that are being censored, sanitized, and carefully curated to obfuscate the truth — it is also those in Sudan.

Every horrific memory, every overwhelming image, every untold story and unspoken grief mirrors both Sudan and Gaza: Every mother burying the remains of her children; every mother shielding her children with her bare hands from falling bombs; every mother dying to feed her little ones. Every father digging through rubble with his own hands to retrieve the bodies of those he loved. Every child whose world collapsed, leaving them alone. Every family fleeing death only to meet it again. Every aching stomach, every trembling one, every amputated limb, hollow eye, and stunted body.

In death, and hopefully in survival, Sudan resembles Gaza. None of us is free until all of us are free.

 Journalists Alone Cannot Stave Off Autocracy

 Susan Chira

With democracies under siege around the globe, it is tempting to see an independent press as freedom's bulwark. In 2023, for instance, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called independent journalism “the foundation of democracy and justice” and “the very lifeblood of human rights.” But the sobering reality is that even the bravest, most determined journalists cannot shore up democracy without strong institutions. The media can expose abuses of power only if civil servants, government insiders, and other sources share sensitive information. And the press's reporting, in turn, can constrain authoritarians' power only if it spurs further action. Without prosecutors empowered to bring charges against wrongdoers, judges willing to strike down overreach, legislators daring enough to demand investigations and change laws, and citizens outraged enough to protest, any revelations by journalists will fall on stony ground.

As the assault on press freedom intensifies in the United States, it is instructive to examine the role that journalism has played in other countries facing democratic erosion. The cases of South Korea, Brazil, and El Salvador show the promise—and limits—of the media in bolstering democracy and curbing rising authoritarianism. In these countries, journalists have exposed corruption and mobilized citizens to protest leaders who were abusing their power. But only when other influential institutions and individuals such as courts, businesspeople, and whistleblowers helped check executive overreach did journalism effectively hold power to account. Members of the press in these countries have a warning: the U.S. institutions that support journalism and translate its work into real protections for the public are faltering. And if these institutions are not strengthened, no reporting—no matter how dogged—can arrest tyranny.

The collapse of communism in the late 1980s ushered in a captivating narrative about how authoritarianism can be vanquished. First, courageous journalists break a government stranglehold on information. Then, a disillusioned, outraged public takes to the streets calling for freedom. It was an alluring premise: if people are told the truth, dictators will fall.

But that was always an oversimplification that overstated journalism's power. And in the intervening years, tectonic economic shifts have weakened journalism's financial pillars. The rise of the Internet broke journalism's economic model by driving down advertising revenues and widely circulating information the public once had to pay to receive. A 2025 report by the nongovernmental organization Reporters Without Borders noted that 34 countries are experiencing “mass closures” of news outlets, and in 160 out of 180 countries worldwide, media outlets struggle with financial stability.

And the delivery of news has fragmented. Silvio R. Waisbord, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, notes that 30 years ago, “the mainstream press had the attention of the elites and the public.” Now, “stories written from an accountability perspective are not reaching the people who should be exposed to the information.” The digital revolution has also given governments and political partisans more opportunities to manipulate the information citizens receive.



Waisbord grew up under the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983 and went on to study democratic erosion in Latin America. Generally, he has found that the press is most effective as a tool to counter authoritarianism when it can exploit dissent among elites to extract information. For example, a sprawling 2014 corruption scandal that convicted business leaders and politicians in Brazil and other Latin American countries was sustained by press reports that relied on leaks about testimony and wiretaps from government insiders determined to focus public attention on wrongdoing. Such exposés can, in turn, stiffen the spines of institutions that check authoritarian power such as the legislature, the judiciary, and the military.

In the United States in the 1970s, journalists at The Washington Post relied on an FBI insider—the fabled Deep Throat, later revealed to be the agency's third in command—to reveal a multitude of crimes by President Richard Nixon and his associates. The journalists used Deep Throat's information to pry more revelations from Nixon aides troubled by their own complicity in abuses of power. And those revelations prompted action by the judiciary and Congress. The Supreme Court rejected Nixon's claims of executive privilege and forced the release of the infamous Oval Office tapes. When the House Judiciary Committee subsequently pursued impeaching Nixon, Nixon's own Republican Party members turned against him, warning him that they would vote to impeach, prompting Nixon to resign.

But if the institutions that can act to redress injustice are docile, captive, or compromised, little or nothing changes. And if people simply do not see what journalists publish in an increasingly siloed and isolated news landscape, they are unlikely to press for change, either.

South Korea, Brazil, and El Salvador all faced grave threats to democracy, and their different fates illustrate what kind of institutional ecosystem helps a valiant press defend freedom—and how even brave journalists can be muzzled. During South Korea's nearly quarter century of authoritarian rule from the 1960s to 1980s, many news outlets were cowed into docility, dutifully echoing government propaganda. Even after massive protests by South Korean citizens forced the military dictator Chun Doo-hwan to step aside in 1988, the country's young democracy struggled. Its repressive intelligence apparatus remained strong; legislators balked at the compromises necessary to pass laws and bridge old enmities, generating gridlock and intensifying partisanship.

When President Park Geun-hye took power in 2013, she adopted an authoritarian style that reminded many South Koreans of the 15 years of repression her father, Park Chung-hee, imposed after he seized power in a 1961 coup. She pressured the CEOs of public broadcasting companies to fire journalists, blacklisted thousands of artists from receiving government funding, and weaponized defamation laws to persecute reporters.

But the emergence of democracy in South Korea had also encouraged the creation of new press outlets committed to exposing abuse and corruption. Park Geun-hye was ultimately brought down by an improbable cooperation between Hankyoreh, a left-leaning daily newspaper established in 1988, and two more-conservative television stations. Soomin Seo, a former reporter and associate professor of journalism at Sogang University's School of Communication, researched how the outlets uncovered payoffs to Choi Soon-sil, the president's close adviser. Her analysis revealed that, frustrated by what they saw as political pressure on media leaders to halt coverage of the scandals, reporters from competing outlets shared sources—a remarkable departure from the norm. Although reporters did not disclose the identity of their sources, their scoops—one of which was prompted by the acquisition of a laptop showing that Choi had helped edit some of Park's speeches—suggested that government insiders may well have assisted journalists.



The revelation that Choi's daughter was offered entrance to a top university despite mediocre grades stirred particular public outrage because ordinary Koreans cram for years for notoriously competitive entrance exams. That prompted nationwide rallies calling for Park's resignation. Citizens formed human chains around the National Assembly to block armored vehicles, sewed and hung banners, provided food and drink, and otherwise sustained anticorruption demonstrations. Seo tells me that South Koreans' fearlessness in protest was driven by their searing memories of dictatorship. “We were the first generation who could travel abroad freely, who grew up in a liberal postdictatorship generation,” she says. In the end, South Korea's legislature voted to impeach Park. Public protests continued for months while the country's constitutional court deliberated whether to uphold the impeachment; ultimately, the court unanimously voted to remove Park from office.

In late 2024, South Korea's legislature again impeached a president—this time for unconstitutionally imposing martial law. Yoon Suk-yeol had already been criticized for presiding over extensive government raids of newsrooms and journalists' homes on charges of spreading “fake news,” vetoing general labor protections, and whitewashing investigations of government failures. After Yoon imposed martial law, around-the-clock news coverage helped prompt South Koreans to take to the streets. Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation, a legacy television and radio broadcaster, was particularly assertive, including on its wildly popular YouTube channel. According to a 2024 report by the Korea Press Foundation and the Reuters Institute, 51 percent of South Koreans get news from YouTube, the highest percentage among 47 countries that were surveyed.

South Korea's legislature and judiciary again proved willing to buck presidential power. The constitutional court upheld Yoon's impeachment unanimously, even though—as was the case in 2017, when Park was ousted—many of the justices had been appointed by the presidents they removed.

Brazil's success in holding President Jair Bolsonaro accountable for plotting a coup after his election loss in 2022 also highlights how vital internal government dissent and an independent judiciary are to the press's efforts to expose and curb autocracy. After Bolsonaro became president in 2019, he relentlessly attacked the press, mounted disinformation campaigns, and threatened the independence of Brazil's elections. Brazil was ruled by a military junta from the 1960s to the 1980s, initially supported by a press that believed that temporary leadership by the military could restore stability and fend off communist threats. But Pedro Doria, a columnist for O Globo, the country's leading daily newspaper, tells me that the resulting long, brutal junta made publishers ashamed of their early compliance and determined to be bolder when Bolsonaro threatened democratic norms. Journalists, businesspeople, and lawyers felt “really clear” that “we had to scream from the beginning,” Doria said. They felt they had to signal to Bolsonaro and any potential Bolsonaro supporters in the military that Brazil could not retreat to dictatorship.

A torrent of journalistic investigations into corruption and misgovernance followed. But the first step in revealing wrongdoing is to find government insiders willing to take risks to provide information—people with access to documents and decisions that show the inner workings of government. Patricia Campos Mello, whose investigations were a crucial spur to judicial action against Bolsonaro, recalls that her sources were determined not to see Brazil dragged back into dictatorship and felt that it was a matter of conscience to speak out. “There was so much internal dissent. It was a paradise of leaks,” she says. People “were brave enough to reach out to journalists.”

Her resulting articles for Folha de São Paulo, one of Brazil's largest and most influential newspapers, documented financial irregularities in Bolsonaro's 2018 presidential campaign and his government's subsequent use of social media to target opponents. Bolsonaro attacked Campos Mello on social media and in public statements, repeating a source's false charges that she traded sex for leaks and triggering a flood of sexual-assault threats and online harassment against her. (A court eventually awarded Campos Mello compensation for “moral damages.”)

In the end, Campos Mello's articles and the subsequent public outrage helped push the judiciary to prosecute Bolsonaro. Brazil's independent judiciary proved vital in translating investigations into action. Federal and special election courts changed electoral rules to bolster elections' fairness, restrained the use of social media in the country, and convicted Bolsonaro for plotting to stay in power after his 2022 election loss. Because enough opposition lawmakers remained in the legislature, Bolsonaro had neither the absolute sway nor the dealmaking ability to replace judges, Doria says. When journalists did their jobs, Campos Mello says, they “could trust the judiciary would do something.”

In El Salvador, by contrast, even an outspoken press has struggled to constrain authoritarian repression. In 1992, El Salvador became a democracy after a bloody 12-year civil war. Its constitution attempted to shield the army and the judiciary from politics. But these institutions remained vulnerable to political interference, and widespread poverty and social inequality continued to plague the country. Nayib Bukele was elected president in 2019 by Salvadorans terrorized by drug gangs and disgusted by a political establishment they saw as feckless and corrupt.

He soon gutted the country's already fragile institutions and blocked avenues of resistance, moving quickly to neuter the legislature by sending members of the Salvadoran military into the parliament building in 2020 in an effort to coerce support for his power grab. Later, his party won a supermajority in the legislature. Those loyalist legislators then replaced many judges on El Salvador's Supreme Court, which in turn reinterpreted the constitution's limits on presidential tenure to allow Bukele to win reelection in 2024. Bukele has now decreed that he can stay in office indefinitely.

The Salvadoran digital outlet El Faro has a 15-year track record of fearless investigations, particularly its exposure of politicians' ties to hated drug gangs. After Bukele took power, it continued to chronicle the erosion of democratic freedoms and government abuses of human rights, aided by alarmed inside sources. But El Faro came under relentless assault by the government—including surveillance, money-laundering charges, and smear campaigns by the very institutions that supported democracy in other countries: the judicial system, public prosecutors, and a legislature compliant with Bukele.

In 2022, the outlet discovered that at least 22 of its 30 journalists had been hacked by a state operator. El Faro published this information along with an editorial directed to its sources, advising them that they should assume that people in the government knew that they might be sources. Fears of government retribution then prompted a sourcing crisis, says El Faro's director and co-founder, Carlos Dada. “All of our sources disappeared, and we needed to start again” to build “a system of protection for them.” El Faro kept reporting, publishing video interviews earlier this year with a prominent gang leader describing deals with Bukele. But threats of imminent arrest led most of the outlet's journalists to flee the country, and it now operates in exile in Costa Rica. El Faro is not alone: the Salvadorian Press Association recently noted that over the past six months, at least 53 journalists have fled the country.

“Bukele controls all the institutions,” Dada laments. “Not only the legislature and the judiciary [but] also the attorney general's office, the army, and the police.” That means “there is no protection [and] no counterbalance. We are defenseless except for our journalism.”

The effectiveness of the press depends on an interdependent ecosystem of institutions and democratic norms. These include a professionalized civil service and courageous government insiders, an independent legislature and judiciary, and citizens willing to risk protesting openly.

Even in South Korea and Brazil, journalists are feeling more pressure. Seo, the media professor, warned that South Koreans' rising distrust of kiregi, or “trash journalists,” who have resorted to sensationalism, and a deluge of partisan commentators on social media could jeopardize trust in the press. Brazilian journalists, meanwhile, report censorship pressure from both the right and the left. As judges shut down some right-wing voices on social media, concerns are rising that the very judiciary that prosecuted Bolsonaro has become too powerful.

American journalists are covering the Trump administration with vigor, chronicling the human cost of the administration's crackdown on immigration, investigating corruption and self-dealing, and detailing his conflicts of interest and the shattering of democratic norms. This coverage can resonate. Videos and articles with wrenching scenes of children torn from their parents during immigrant detentions appear to be one factor depressing Trump's approval ratings. And a press report exposing a plan by the Pentagon to brief the businessman Elon Musk on U.S. policy toward China led the Pentagon to backtrack, potentially averting overt corruption.

But journalists in South Korea, Brazil, and El Salvador warn that the institutions that make journalism an effective safeguard for democracy are weakening in the United States. Civil servants have been fired en masse and replaced by loyalists, hampering journalists' ability to obtain sensitive information. The Republican majority in Congress has not defended its constitutional power to make tariff policy and has enabled the Trump administration's efforts to impound money appropriated by the legislature, undercutting the system of checks and balances. Many federal judges have ruled acts by the administration unlawful or unconstitutional. But unlike in Brazil or South Korea, the U.S. Supreme Court has embraced an expansive vision of executive power. It has ruled in Trump's favor in multiple cases, including by allowing racial profiling in immigration arrests and the mass firing of civil servants.



And unlike in Brazil, many corporate media owners are fast succumbing to Trump's pressure. CBS News agreed to pay $16 million and ABC News paid $15 million to settle lawsuits brought by Trump that many First Amendment lawyers believed had no chance to prevail in court. During Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, the publishers of The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times blocked their editorial boards from endorsing his rival. Amazon—whose executive chairman, Jeff Bezos, is also The Washington Post's publisher—donated large sums to Trump's inauguration and his proposed new White House ballroom. Brendon Carr, the Federal Communication Commission's chairman, has openly threatened news outlets. Trump continues to publicly insult journalists, recently telling a female reporter, “Quiet, piggy,” and dismissing the 2018 killing and dismembering of Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S.-based Saudi journalist, with the phrase, “Things happen.”

To be sure, the United States is still far from El Salvador's dystopia. Dada, the Salvadoran news outlet chief, notes the strengths the United States still possesses. “You still have an opposition; we don't. You have a very healthy civil society”—including robust public protest and multiple nongovernmental organizations committed to protecting democracy. In El Salvador, unlike in the United States, the army is now loyal only to the president, although the Trump administration has now deployed the National Guard to several cities, purged many high-ranking military officers, and crossed former redlines by making overtly political speeches to generals.

Democracy scholars and press freedom advocates in the United States are clear on what Americans need to do to protect the rights they have long taken for granted. Pushing back against abuses of power takes collective action—as when all but a handful of news organizations refused to accept the Trump administration's efforts to restrict reporting on military affairs and lost their Pentagon press passes. Standing up to pressure can dispel fear and embolden further pushback—as when congressional Republicans resisted intense lobbying by Trump and joined with Democrats to demand the release of the Epstein files. Fighting baseless lawsuits in the courts defends press freedom, while settling in advance undermines it.

One reason so many Brazilian and South Korean institutions and individuals stood up to democratic erosion was that they retained vivid memories of persecution under dictatorship. Americans have long considered themselves as apart from much of the world, secure in a long history of vibrant democracy and robust journalism. But other countries' experiences suggest that complacency is a delusion.

 How to Build a New Global Order Before It's Too Late

 Alexander Stubb

The world has changed more in the past four years than in the previous 30. Our news feeds brim with strife and tragedy. Russia bombards Ukraine, the Middle East seethes, and wars rage in Africa. As conflicts are on the rise, democracies, it seems, are in demise. The post–Cold War era is over. Despite the hopes that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall, the globe did not unite in embracing democracy and market capitalism. Indeed, the forces that were supposed to bring the world together—trade, energy, technology, and information—are now pulling it apart.

We live in a new world of disorder. The liberal, rules-based order that arose after the end of World War II is now dying. Multilateral cooperation is giving way to multipolar competition. Opportunistic transactions seem to matter more than defending international rules. Great-power competition is back, as the rivalry between China and the United States sets the frame of geopolitics. But it is not the only force shaping global order. Emerging middle powers, including Brazil, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Turkey, have become game-changers. Together, they have the economic means and geopolitical heft to tilt the global order toward stability or greater turmoil. They also have a reason to demand change: the post–World War II multilateral system did not adapt to adequately reflect their position in the world and afford them the role that they deserve. A triangular contest among what I call the global West, the global East, and the global South is taking shape. In choosing either to strengthen the multilateral system or seek multipolarity, the global South will decide whether geopolitics in the next era leans toward cooperation, fragmentation, or domination.

The next five to ten years will likely determine the world order for decades to come. Once an order settles in, it tends to stick for a while. After World War I, a new order lasted two decades. The next order, after World War II, lasted for four decades. Now, 30 years after the end of the Cold War, something new is again emerging. This is the last chance for Western countries to convince the rest of the world that they are capable of dialogue rather than monologue, consistency rather than double standards, and cooperation rather than domination. If countries eschew cooperation for competition, a world of even greater conflict looms.

Every state has agency, even small ones such as mine, Finland. The key is to try to maximize influence and, with the tools available, push for solutions. For me, this means doing everything I can to preserve the liberal world order, even if that system is not in vogue right now. International institutions and norms provide the framework for global cooperation. They need to be updated and reformed to better reflect the growing economic and political power of the global South and the global East. Western leaders have long talked about the urgency of fixing multilateral institutions such as the United Nations. Now, we must get it done, starting with rebalancing the power within the UN and other international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. Without such changes, the multilateral system as it exists will crumble. That system is not perfect; it has inherent flaws and can never exactly reflect the world around it. But the alternatives are much worse: spheres of influence, chaos, and disorder.

I started studying political science and international relations at Furman University in the United States in 1989. The Berlin Wall fell that autumn. Soon after, Germany reunified, central and eastern Europe escaped the shackles of communism, and what had been a bipolar world—pitting a communist and authoritarian Soviet Union against a capitalist and democratic United States—became a unipolar one. The United States was now the undisputed superpower. The liberal international order had won.

I was elated at the time. It seemed to me, and to so many others then, that we stood at the threshold of a brighter age. The political scientist Francis Fukuyama called that moment “the end of history,” and I wasn't the only one to believe that the triumph of liberalism was certain. Most nation-states would invariably pivot toward democracy, market capitalism, and freedom. Globalization would lead to economic interdependence. Old divisions would melt, and the world would become one. Even at the end of the decade, as I finished my Ph.D. in European integration at the London School of Economics, this future still seemed imminent.

But that future never arrived. The unipolar moment proved short-lived. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, the West turned its back on the basic values that it claimed to uphold. Its commitment to international law was questioned. U.S.-led interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq failed. The global financial crash of 2008 delivered a severe reputational blow to the West's economic model, rooted in global markets. The United States no longer drove global politics alone. China emerged as a superpower through its skyrocketing manufacturing, exports, and economic growth, and its rivalry with the United States has since come to dominate geopolitics. The last decade has also seen the further erosion of multilateral institutions, growing suspicion and friction regarding free trade, and intensifying competition over technology.

Russia's full-scale war of aggression in Ukraine in February 2022 dealt another body blow to the old order. It was one of the most blatant violations of the rules-based system since the end of World War II and certainly the worst Europe had seen. That the culprit was a permanent member of the UN Security Council, which was set up to preserve peace, was all the more damning. States that were supposed to uphold the system brought it crashing down.

The international order, however, has not disappeared. Amid the wreckage, it is shifting from multilateralism to multipolarity. Multilateralism is a system of global cooperation that rests on international institutions and common rules. Its key principles apply equally to all countries, irrespective of size. Multipolarity, by contrast, is an oligopoly of power. The structure of a multipolar world rests on several, often competing poles. Dealmaking and agreements among a limited number of players form the structure of such an order, invariably weakening common rules and institutions. Multipolarity can lead to ad hoc and opportunistic behavior and a fluid array of alliances based on states' real-time self-interest. A multipolar world risks leaving small and medium-sized countries out—bigger powers make deals over their heads. Whereas multilateralism leads to order, multipolarity tends toward disorder and conflict.

There is a growing tension between those who promote multilateralism and an order based on the rule of law and those who speak the language of multipolarity and transactionalism. Small states and middle powers, as well as regional organizations such as the African Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the EU, and the South American bloc Mercosur, promote multilateralism. China, for its part, promotes multipolarity with shades of multilateralism; it ostensibly endorses multilateral groupings such as BRICS—the non-Western coalition whose original members were Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization that actually want to give rise to a more multipolar order. The United States has shifted its emphasis from multilateralism toward transactionalism but still has commitments to regional institutions such as NATO. Many states, both big and small, are pursuing what can be described as a multivectoral foreign policy. In essence, their aim is to diversify their relations with multiple actors rather than aligning with any one bloc.

A transactional or multivectoral foreign policy is dominated by interests. Small states, for instance, often balance between great powers: they can align with China in some areas and side with the United States in others, all while trying to avoid being dominated by any one actor. Interests drive the practical choices of states, and this is entirely legitimate. But such an approach need not eschew values, which should underpin everything a state does. Even a transactional foreign policy should rest on a core of fundamental values. They include the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, the prohibition of the use of force, and the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Countries have, overwhelmingly, a clear interest in upholding these values and ensuring that violators face real consequences.

Many countries are rejecting multilateralism in favor of more ad hoc arrangements and deals. The United States, for instance, is focused on bilateral trade and business agreements. China uses the Belt and Road Initiative, its vast global infrastructure investment program, to facilitate both bilateral diplomacy and economic transactions. The EU is forging bilateral free trade agreements that risk falling short of World Trade Organization rules. This, paradoxically, is happening when the world needs multilateralism more than ever to solve common challenges, such as climate change, development shortfalls, and the regulation of advanced technologies. Without a strong multilateral system, all diplomacy becomes transactional. A multilateral world makes the common good a self-interest. A multipolar world runs simply on self-interest.

Foreign policy is often based on three pillars: values, interests, and power. These three elements are key when the balance and dynamics of world order are changing. I come from a relatively small country with a population of close to six million people. Although we have one of the largest defense forces in Europe, our diplomacy is premised on values and interests. Power, both the hard and the soft kind, is mostly a luxury of the bigger players. They can project military and economic power, forcing smaller players to align with their goals. But small countries can find power in cooperating with others. Alliances, groupings, and smart diplomacy are what give a smaller player influence well beyond the size of its military and economy. Often, those alliances are based on shared values, such as a commitment to human rights and the rule of law.

As a small country bordering an imperial power, Finland has learned that sometimes a state must set aside some values to protect others, or simply to survive. Statehood is based on the principles of independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. After World War II, Finland retained its independence, unlike our Baltic friends that were absorbed by the Soviet Union. But we lost ten percent of our territory to the Soviet Union, including the areas where my father and grandparents were born. And, crucially, we had to give up some sovereignty. Finland was unable to join international institutions we felt we naturally belonged to, notably the EU and NATO.

During the Cold War, Finnish foreign policy was defined by “pragmatic realism.” To keep the Soviet Union from attacking us again, as it had in 1939, we had to compromise our Western values. This era in Finnish history, which has lent the term “Finlandization” to international relations, is not one we can be particularly proud of, but we managed to keep our independence. That experience has made us wary of any possibility of its repetition. When some suggest that Finlandization might be a solution for ending the war in Ukraine, I vehemently disagree. Such a peace would come at too great a cost, what would effectively be the surrender of sovereignty and territory.



After the end of the Cold War, Finland, like so many other countries, embraced the idea that the values of the global West would become the norm—what I call “values-based idealism.” This allowed Finland to join the European Union in 1995. At the same time, Finland made a serious mistake: it decided, voluntarily, to stay out of NATO. (For the record, I have been an avid advocate of Finnish NATO membership for 30 years.) Some Finns harbored an idealistic belief that Russia would eventually become a liberal democracy, so joining NATO was unnecessary. Others feared that Russia would react badly to Finland joining the alliance. Yet others thought that Finland contributed to maintaining a balance—and therefore peace—in the Baltic Sea region by staying out of the alliance. All these reasons turned out to be wrong, and Finland has adjusted accordingly; it joined NATO after Russia's full-scale attack on Ukraine.

That was a decision that followed from both Finland's values and its interests. Finland has embraced what I have called “values-based realism”: committing to a set of universal values based on freedom, fundamental rights, and international rules while still respecting the realities of the world's diversity of cultures and histories. The global West must stay true to its values but understand that the world's problems will not be solved only through collaboration with like-minded countries.

Values-based realism might sound like a contradiction of terms, but it is not. Two influential theories of the post–Cold War era seemed to pit universal values against a more realist assessment of political fault lines. Fukuyama's end of history thesis saw the triumph of capitalism over communism as heralding a world that would become ever more liberal and market-oriented. The political scientist Samuel Huntington's vision of a “clash of civilizations” predicted that the fault lines of geopolitics would move from ideological differences to cultural ones. In truth, states can draw from both understandings in negotiating today's shifting order. In crafting foreign policy, governments of the global West can maintain their faith in democracy and markets without insisting they are universally applicable; in other places, different models may prevail. And even within the global West, the pursuit of security and the defense of sovereignty will occasionally make it impossible to strictly adhere to liberal ideals.

Countries should strive for a cooperative world order of values-based realism, respecting both the rule of law and cultural and political differences. For Finland, that means reaching out to the countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America to better understand their positions on Russia's war in Ukraine and other ongoing conflicts. It also means holding pragmatic discussions on an equal footing on important global issues, such as those to do with technology sharing, raw materials, and climate change.

Three broad regions now make up the global balance of power: the global West, the global East, and the global South. The global West comprises roughly 50 countries and has traditionally been led by the United States. Its members include primarily democratic, market-oriented states in Europe and North America and their far-flung allies Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. These countries have typically aimed to uphold a rules-based multilateral order, even if they disagree on how best to preserve, reform, or reinvent it.

The global East consists of roughly 25 states led by China. It includes a network of aligned states—notably Iran, North Korea, and Russia—that seek to revise or supplant the existing rules-based international order. These countries are bound by a common interest, namely, the desire to reduce the power of the global West.

The global South, comprising many of the world's developing and middle-income states from Africa, Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (and the majority of the world's population) spans roughly 125 states. Many of them suffered under Western colonialism and then again as theaters for the proxy wars of the Cold War era. The global South includes many middle powers or “swing states,” notably Brazil, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa. Demographic trends, economic development, and the extraction and export of natural resources drive the ascendance of these states.

The global West and the global East are fighting for the hearts and minds of the global South. The reason is simple: they understand that the global South will decide the direction of the new world order. As the West and the East pull in different directions, the South has the swing vote.

The global West cannot simply attract the global South by extolling the virtues of freedom and democracy; it also needs to fund development projects, make investments in economic growth, and, most important, give the South a seat at the table and share power. The global East would be equally mistaken to think that its spending on big infrastructure projects and direct investment buys it full influence in the global South. Love cannot be easily bought. As Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has noted, India and other countries in the global South are not simply sitting on the fence but rather standing on their own ground.



In other words, what both Western and Eastern leaders will need is values-based realism. Foreign policy is never binary. A policymaker has to make daily choices that involve both values and interests. Will you buy weapons from a country that is violating international law? Will you fund a dictatorship that is fighting terrorism? Will you give aid to a country that considers homosexuality a crime? Do you trade with a country that allows the death penalty? Some values are nonnegotiable. These include upholding fundamental and human rights, protecting minorities, preserving democracy, and respecting the rule of law. These values anchor what the global West should stand for, especially in its appeals to the global South. At the same time, the global West has to understand that not everyone shares these values.

The aim of values-based realism is to find a balance between values and interests in a way that prioritizes principles but recognizes the limits of a state's power when the interests of peace, stability, and security are at stake. A rules-based world order underpinned by a set of well-functioning international institutions that enshrine fundamental values remains the best way to prevent competition leading to collision. But as these institutions have lost their salience, countries must embrace a harder sense of realism. Leaders must acknowledge the differences among countries: the realities of geography, history, culture, religion, and different stages in economic development. If they want others to better address issues such as citizens' rights, environmental practices, and good governance, they should lead by example and offer support—not lectures.

Values-based realism begins with dignified behavior, with respect for the views of others and an understanding of differences. It means collaboration based on partnerships of equals rather than some historical perception of what relations among the global West, East, and South should look like. The way for states to look forward rather than backward is to focus on important common projects such as infrastructure, trade, and climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Many obstacles lie before any attempt by the world's three spheres to build a global order that at once respects differences and allows states to set their national interests in a broader framework of cooperative international relations. The costs of failure, however, are immense: the first half of the twentieth century was warning enough.

Uncertainty is a part of international relations, and never more so than during the transition of one era into another. The key is to understand why the change is happening and how to react to it. If the global West reverts to its old ways of direct or indirect dominance or outright arrogance, it will lose the battle. If it realizes that the global South will be a key part of the next world order, it just might be able to forge both values-based and interest-based partnerships that can tackle the main challenges of the globe. Values-based realism will give the West enough room to navigate this new age of international relations.

A set of postwar institutions helped steer the world through its most rapid era of development and sustained an extraordinary period of relative peace. Today, they are at risk of collapsing. But they must survive, because a world based on competition without cooperation will lead to conflict. To survive, however, they must change, because too many states lack agency in the existing system and, in the absence of change, will divest themselves from it. These states can't be blamed for doing so; the new world order will not wait.

At least three scenarios could emerge in the decade ahead. In the first one, the current disorder would simply persist. There would still be elements of the old order left, but respect for international rules and institutions would be à la carte and mostly based on interests—not innate values. The capacity to solve major challenges would remain limited, but the world at least would not devolve into greater chaos. Ending conflicts, however, would become especially difficult because most peace deals would be transactional and lack the authority that comes with the imprimatur of the United Nations.

Things could be worse: in a second scenario, the foundations of the liberal international order—its rules and institutions—would continue to erode, and the existing order would collapse. The world would move closer to chaos without a clear nexus of power and with states unable to solve acute crises, such as famines, pandemics, or conflicts. Strongmen, warlords, and nonstate actors would fill power vacuums left behind by receding international organizations. Local conflicts would risk triggering wider wars. Stability and predictability would be the exception, not the norm, in a dog-eat-dog world. Peace mediation would be close to impossible.

But it doesn't have to be that way. In a third scenario, a new symmetry of power among the global West, East, and South would produce a rebalanced world order in which countries could deal with the most pressing global challenges through cooperation and dialogue among equals. That balance would contain competition and nudge the world toward greater cooperation on climate, security, and technology issues—critical challenges that no country can solve alone. In this scenario, the principles of the UN Charter would prevail, leading to just and lasting agreements. But for that to happen, international institutions must be reformed.



Reform begins at the top, namely, in the United Nations. Reform is always a long and complicated process, but there are at least three possible changes that would automatically strengthen the UN and give agency to those states that feel that they don't have enough power in New York, Geneva, Vienna, or Nairobi.

First, all major continents need to be represented in the UN Security Council, at all times. It is simply unacceptable that there is no permanent representation from Africa and Latin America in the Security Council and that China alone represents Asia. The number of permanent members should be increased by at least five: two from Africa, two from Asia, and one from Latin America.

Second, no single state should have veto power in the Security Council. The veto was necessary in the aftermath of World War II, but in today's world it has incapacitated the Security Council. The UN agencies in Geneva work well precisely because no single member can prevent them from doing so.

Third, if a permanent or rotating member of the Security Council violates the UN Charter, its membership in the UN should be suspended. This would mean that the body would have suspended Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Such a suspension decision could be taken in the General Assembly. There should be no room for double standards in the United Nations.



Global trade and financial institutions also need to be updated. The World Trade Organization, which has been crippled for years by the paralysis of its dispute settlement mechanism, is still essential. Despite an increase in free trade agreements outside the WTO's purview, over 70 percent of global trade is still conducted under the WTO's “most favored nation” principle. The point of the multilateral trading system is to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of all its members. Tariffs and other infringements of WTO rules end up hurting everyone. The current reform process must lead to greater transparency, especially with respect to subsidies, and flexibility in the WTO decision-making processes. And these reforms must be enacted swiftly; the system will lose credibility if the WTO remains mired in its current impasse.

Reform is hard, and some of these proposals may sound unrealistic. But so did those made in San Francisco when the United Nations was founded over 80 years ago. Whether the 193 members of the United Nations embrace these changes will depend on whether they focus their foreign policy on values, interests, or power. Sharing power on the basis of values and interests was the foundation of the creation of the liberal world order after World War II. It is time to revise the system that has served us so well for almost a century.

The wildcard for the global West in all of this will be whether the United States wants to preserve the multilateral world order it has been so instrumental in building and from which it has benefited so greatly. That may not be an easy path, given Washington's withdrawal from key institutions and agreements, such as the World Health Organization and the Paris climate agreement, and its newly mercantilist approach to cross-border trade. The UN system has helped preserve peace between the great powers, enabling the United States to emerge as the leading geopolitical power. In many UN institutions, it has taken the leading role and been able to drive its policy goals very effectively. Global free trade has helped the United States establish itself as the leading economic power in the world while also bringing low-cost products to American consumers. Alliances such as NATO have given the United States military and political advantages outside its own region. It remains the task of the rest of the West to convince the Trump administration of the value of both the postwar institutions and the United States' active role in them.

The wildcard for the global East will be how China plays its hand on the world stage. It could take more steps to fill the power vacuums left by the United States in areas such as free trade, climate change cooperation, and development. It could try to shape the international institutions it now has a much stronger foothold in. It might seek to further project power in its own region. And it might abandon its long-held hide-your-strength and bide-your-time strategy and decide that the time has come for more aggressive actions in, for instance, the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.

An international order, such as that forged by the Roman Empire, can sometimes survive for centuries. Most of the time, however, it lasts for just a few decades. Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine marks the beginning of yet another change in the world order. For young people today, it is their 1918, 1945, or 1989 moment. The world can take a wrong turn at these junctures, as happened after World War I, when the League of Nations was unable to contain great-power competition, resulting in another bloody world war.

Countries can also get it more or less right, as happened after World War II with the establishment of the United Nations. That postwar order did, after all, preserve peace between the two superpowers of the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the United States. To be sure, that relative stability came at a high cost for those states that were forced into submission or suffered during proxy conflicts. And even as the end of World War II laid the groundwork for an order that survived for decades, it also planted the seeds of the current imbalance.

In 1945, the war's winners met in Yalta, in Crimea. There, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin crafted a postwar order based on spheres of influence. The UN Security Council would emerge as the stage where the superpowers could address their differences, but it offered little space for others. At Yalta, the big states made a deal over the small ones. That historical wrong must now be made right.



The 1975 convening of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe offers a stark contrast to Yalta. Thirty-two European countries, plus Canada, the Soviet Union, and the United States, met in Helsinki to create a European security structure based on rules and norms applicable to all. They agreed to fundamental principles governing states' behavior toward their citizens and one another. It was a remarkable feat of multilateralism at a time of major tensions, and it became instrumental in precipitating the end of the Cold War.

Yalta was multipolar in its outcomes, and Helsinki was multilateral. Now the world faces a choice, and I believe Helsinki offers the right way forward. The choices we all make in the next decade will define the world order for the twenty-first century.

Small states such as mine are not bystanders in the story. The new order will be determined by decisions taken by political leaders in both big and small states, whether democrats, autocrats, or something in between. And here a particular responsibility falls on the global West, as the architect of the passing order and still, economically and militarily, the most powerful global coalition. The way we carry that mantle matters. This is our last chance.

            Pope Leo has said he believes the United States needs to find “another way” in handling the situation in Venezuela, warning against any military incursion and saying it would be better to pursue dialogue or apply economic pressure.
    


            “It seems there is the possibility that there be some activity, even an operation to invade Venezuelan territory,” Leo, who spent several years as a missionary and bishop in Peru, told reporters on board the papal plane returning to Rome from Beirut on Tuesday. “I truly believe that it is better to look for ways of dialogue, maybe pressure, including economic pressure, but looking another way to change, if that is what they want to do in the United States.”
    


            The first American pope's comments come at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and Venezuela, with Leo saying church leaders in the South American country were looking for “ways to calm the situation.”
    


            He noted that US President Donald Trump and his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolás Maduro had spoken on the phone and that because “the voices that come from the US change, with some frequency sometimes, one needs to see.”
    


            During an in-flight press conference covering a range of topics, Leo also called for Europe and North America to be “a little less fearful” when it comes to immigrants of different faiths. Asked about Catholics who see Islam as a “threat” to Christianity in Europe, Leo said he is aware of people's fears, but said they are often “generated by people who are against immigration and trying to keep out people who may be from another country, another religion, another race.”
    


            Instead, Leo said his visit to Turkey and Lebanon underlined that “dialogue and friendship between Muslims and Christians is possible” citing Lebanon as a country which teaches friendship between Christians and Muslims. He said the lessons from Lebanon need to be “heard in Europe or North America, that we should perhaps be a little less fearful and look for ways of promoting authentic dialogue and respect.”
    


            His comments on migration come less than a week after Trump said he was considering permanently banning immigration from what he called “third world countries.”

            The pope also stressed the importance of Europe in forging a peace plan for Ukraine, amid talks taking place between US envoys and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday. “It is clear that on one part the president of the United States thinks that a peace plan can be promoted that he would like to do and that at least in a first moment was without Europe, but the presence of Europe is important and that first plan was modified also because of what Europe was saying.”
    


            Leo also spoke for the first time about how he felt at the time of his election as pope earlier this year, revealing that “just a year or two ago” the 70-year-old had thought about retiring.
    


            “What was it like? I resigned myself to the fact when I saw how things were going that it could be a reality,” he said. “I took a deep breath, I said ‘here we go Lord you're in charge, you lead the way.'”
    


            He also said he hoped to visit Algeria soon to follow in the footsteps of the fourth century Saint Augustine, the founder of his religious order, and to promote a message of dialogue between the Christian and Muslim world.
    


            On May 8, 2025, the cardinals of the Catholic Church elected Cardinal Robert Prevost, the first US-born pope in the church's 2,000-year history. While he has adopted the same priorities as his predecessor, Leo has a more low-key, formal style, with some wondering how he will address the church's major challenges.
    


            Leo spent time with reporters on the way out to Turkey last week, talking about Wordle, wishing American journalists on board a happy Thanksgiving, and being handed pumpkin pies. He also took questions from the media on two occasions during the six-day-long trip.
    


            While some have remarked on his inscrutability, Leo cited a book, which he said would help understand him better. The book titled, “The Practice of the Presence of God” was written by “Brother Lawrence” a 17th century Carmelite lay brother, he said it is an account of someone who “simply gives his life to the Lord and allows the Lord to lead.”
    


            He said: “if you want to know something about me, that's been my spirituality for many years”, adding that it helped him while in Peru “during years of terrorism” and various different assignments.
    


            Leo's decision to hold a press conference on the way back from Lebanon, continues in the steps of his predecessors including Pope Francis who frequently made notable interventions during his in-flight press conferences.

            Prada said on Tuesday it had completed the acquisition of Versace, a brand the Italian luxury group said it had long coveted.
    


            Prada signed a definitive agreement in April to buy Versace from US-based Capri Holdings for about 1.3 billion euros ($1.51 billion), after Capri's sale to Tapestry was scrapped in the wake of a challenge by antitrust regulators.
    


            Lorenzo Bertelli, the son of Prada owners Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli, told Reuters in November that he will become executive chairman of Versace once the integration is complete. He said that Prada had been keen on a deal for several years.
    


            “There had already been contacts during the COVID period, there were talks even before Capri's sale to Tapestry. When that deal fell through over antitrust issues, we came back and tried to speed things up,” Lorenzo Bertelli said.
    


            “It was something that had been in the works for a long time,” he added.
    


Versace's legacy is more than just daring dresses



            Founded in 1978 by Gianni Versace in Milan, the brand renowned for its bold, glamorous aesthetic will join the group's two main labels – its namesake Prada and the smaller but fast growing Miu Miu – marking a sharp strategic shift for the Italian fashion house.
    


            Bertelli, who strongly pushed for the acquisition, said Versace met two key conditions: that it was not too risky financially and that it was worth it, given the brand ranks among the world's leaders in terms of awareness.
    


Sexy, bold and uninhibited: This is what the new Versace looks like



            In March, a few weeks before the deal with Prada was announced, Donatella Versace stepped down as creative chief after almost three decades in the role.
    


            Dario Vitale, formerly design director at Miu Miu, took over the role.

President Donald Trump is hosting a Cabinet meeting, the day after the administration insists that a secondary strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea in a September U.S. military operation was lawful.

The White House said Monday that Navy Vice Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley ordered the second strike and was “within his authority and the law.” The military operation has come under bipartisan scrutiny from lawmakers after The Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had issued a verbal order to “kill everybody” on the boat.

Legal experts say the U.S. military would have committed a crime if survivors were killed. Trump defended Hegseth on Sunday. “Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump said. “And I believe him.” Bradley is expected to provide a classified briefing Thursday to lawmakers overseeing the military.

Other stories we're following:








Trump called affordability — a key issue propelling Democrats to victory in last month's elections — a “con job,” but some of his cabinet secretaries seem to see the issue as a real one for the country.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins referenced it Tuesday as a lingering issue for American farmers. She said the economic “destruction” over which Biden presided increased costs for the nation's farmers, calling them “massive numbers that will take some time to get out from under.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also called affordability a “crisis.” And Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner referenced affordability in the context of hundreds of thousands of Americans he said were able to become first-time homebuyers recently.

Vice President JD Vance sought to bring the issue back around to Trump's viewpoint, acknowledging affordability as a crisis Democrats created.

Brooke Rollins told Trump during the Cabinet meeting that he's been opening overseas markets for U.S. farmers to help them become less reliant on government assistance.

But she said, “we do have a bridge payment we'll be announcing with you next week.”

Rollins didn't say how much the payment will be or which farmers will get assistance.

The president said Tuesday that his administration will embark on a reconstruction of Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia.

“It should be a great airport, and it's not a good airport at all. It's a terrible airport,” Trump said during his Cabinet meeting.

Dulles is one of the three Washington-area airports and its quality and utility is a hotly-debated topic among Washingtonians. The real estate mogul-turned-president said it was “incorrectly designed,” even as he praised Eero Saarinen, the Finnish-American architect who designed its main terminal.

“We're gonna make that into something really spectacular. We have an amazing plan for it,” Trump said.

One of the “people movers” that ferry travelers between Dulles concourses crashed in November. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said his agency will announce a request for bids later Tuesday to repair the “mobile lounges.”

Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner announced his bid for reelection on Tuesday, launching what will be a key campaign in a narrowly divided Senate.

The Virginia senator's campaign announcement says he's running to rein in America's economic crisis, particularly regarding the impact of artificial intelligence on job displacement.

“We need a vision to chart a new path and effective leadership to get it done,” Warner said.

Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate. According to the Cook Political Report, Warner represents a solidly Democratic seat.

The nameplate in front of the defense secretary, visible in video of the meeting, mistakenly includes an extra s.

Trump bragged about his move to rename the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of War. Such a change requires an act of Congress that hasn't occurred.

Trump called on Hegseth to speak first as each Cabinet member gave brief presentations.

Neither Trump nor Hegseth mentioned the nameplate misspelling, but online posters were quick to point it out.

Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom died and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe remains hospitalized following the pre-Thanksgiving shooting in Washington. “I want to pay my deepest respects” to Wolfe and to Beckstrom, Trump said.

The president said he spoke with the parents of both National Guard members, and that Wolfe's mother insisted her son will recover.

“No doctor thought that,” Trump said. “It would be a miracle” if Wolfe lives.

Seated once again at Trump's left, Hegseth said the Department of Defense is getting back to its basics, which he said includes “lethality.”

Hegseth's presence in the Cabinet Room is attracting extra attention as the Pentagon faces bipartisan scrutiny for a follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat in September. The Washington Post first reported that Hegseth issued a verbal order for the second strike that killed survivors on the boat.

Trump did not mention the strikes during his lengthy intro.

The White House said Monday that a Navy admiral acted “within his authority and the law” when he ordered the second strike. Lawmakers have announced congressional reviews of the U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs.

Navy Vice Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, who White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said ordered the second strike, is expected to provide a classified briefing Thursday to lawmakers overseeing the military. “We always have the back of our commanders,” Hegseth said. 

Trump raised the subject of his White House renovation projects as he spoke during what he said is the year's final Cabinet meeting.

Trucks, cranes, excavators and other equipment have taken over the plot where the East Wing once stood.

“Every time I hear them, I love the sound,” Trump said, jokingly adding that he wouldn't say his wife, Melania Trump, is as “thrilled” as he is by the noise.

Trump said the work continues well into the night and that when the first lady asks for it to stop, he responds with, “Sorry, darling. That's progress.”

Leo XVI has called for the United States to pursue dialogue and even economic pressure on Venezuela to achieve its goals, rather than threats of military action.

History's first American pope told reporters aboard the papal plane returning from Lebanon that the Venezuelan bishops conference and the Vatican Embassy in Caracas have been trying to calm the situation and look out for the plight of ordinary Venezuelans.

“The voices coming from the United States change, with a certain frequency at times,” he said. “On the one hand it seems there was telephone conversation between the two presidents, on the other there's this danger, this possibility of an activity, an operation including invading the territory of Venezuela.”

“I believe it's better to look for ways of dialogue, perhaps pressure — including economic pressure — but looking for other ways to change, if that's what the United States wants to do.”

Since his return to office, Trump said Tuesday that global respect for the United States has gone up, taking a moment to swipe at former Democratic President Joe Biden for putting the country in “great danger.”

Trump noted the ongoing diplomatic efforts in which U.S. officials have been speaking with Ukrainian and Russian counterparts in efforts to end that war. 

A U.S. delegation was in Moscow Tuesday sitting down with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Sunday, U.S. and Ukrainian officials completed roughly four hours of talks in Florida.

The 79-year-old president slipped into the third person as he criticized a recent New York Times report on his schedule and stamina. He had complained about the story on social media days ago and insulted the looks of the reporter. Now he's used his Cabinet meeting to continue to air his grievances and insist he's in great shape.

“You people are crazy,” Trump said, addressing reporters in the room. “I'll let you know if there's something wrong.”

Trump said at his Cabinet meeting that next year he'll be “giving back refunds out of the tariffs because we've taken in literally trillions dollars.”

It's not clear how that would work or if Trump could afford to do so without worsening the national debt, which he claims his tariffs will also cut.

The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that so far this year the U.S. government has collected $258.1 billion in tariffs. This revenue from taxes on imports is meaningfully higher than $90 billion collected at this point last year. But it's not trillions, and it's not clear how Trump could refund the taxes he imposed unilaterally by declaring an economic emergency. 

The annual budget shortfall for the last fiscal year was $1.8 trillion, significantly higher than Trump's tariff revenues.

Still, Trump said he's banking on tariffs supplanting income taxes, so much so that “at some point in the not too distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay.”

Rep. Ted Lieu, vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said the Department of Justice must conduct an investigation into a second strike of a vessel accused of trafficking drugs off the coast of Venezuela.

Lieu, who served in the United States Air Force JAG corps, said killing shipwreck survivors is a war crime.

He said the DOJ's investigation should also include a review of Hegseth's actions as defense secretary.

“If the Trump administration does not hold the people accountable, I guarantee you a future administration will do so because there is no statute of limitations for war crimes,” Lieu said.

The president said Tuesday that members of his party are on the same page when it comes to negotiations over health care, as he repeated his frequent criticisms of the Affordable Care Act.

But that's in contrast with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has declined to say whether he will allow a vote on a health care bill. A health care proposal recently circulated by the White House is running into the reality of Republican divisions on the issue.

The tentative proposal would extend expiring ACA subsidies for two years while adjusting eligibility requirements for recipients. The plan has so far been met with a stony silence on Capitol Hill as Republicans debate among themselves whether to overhaul the law, tweak it or simply let the subsidies expire.

It's no secret that Trump is counting the days until Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's term expires in May.

“We'll be announcing somebody, probably early next year, for the new chairman of the Fed,” Trump said at Tuesday's cabinet meeting.

He's in the process of vetting final candidates. Those likely include Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, and Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor. 

Trump continues to joke that he wants Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to lead the U.S. central bank, but he says Bessent has turned him down because he has “the greatest job.”

The Defense secretary is sitting in his usual seat, at Trump's left. His presence in the Cabinet Room is attracting extra attention as the Pentagon faces bipartisan scrutiny for a second, follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea in a September.

The GOP leader said as far as he can tell it was Admiral Bradley's decision to strike the boat a second time.

“He made that call,” Johnson said at his weekly press conference. “I don't know what went into the Admiral's decision,” he added, but he said, the incident is “something Congress will look at.”

Johnson demurred when asked if the video tape should be made available for review.

“I don't know how much of that tape should be released, because I'm not sure how much is sensitive with regard to national security,” he said.

The president has opened what he says is the final meeting of his Cabinet for 2025.

Trump has begun by talking about what he says is a historic $18 trillion in investments in the United States, citing money spent in the country from other nations, as well as what he said was record spending on Black Friday.

Musician Sabrina Carpenter and the publisher of the beloved children's character Franklin the Turtle are disavowing the Trump administration's use of their music and imagery to support its agenda.

Responding to the use of her song “Juno” in a video montage depicting ICE raids, Carpenter tweeted Tuesday: “this video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”

And on Monday, “Franklin the Turtle” publisher Kids Can Press condemned Hegseth's post on X of a manipulated image showing Franklin aiming a bazooka at boats.

“We strongly condemn any denigrating, violent, or unauthorized use of Franklin's name or image, which directly contradicts these values,” the publisher said in a tweet. 

Wilson began with attacks on Democratic lawmakers and mainstream media.

She also maintained the Trump administration's assertions that the U.S. military's attacks on alleged drug boats off the Venezuela coast are “lawful.” At least 83 people have been killed in at least 21 strikes in a campaign now facing House and Senate scrutiny. 

Wilson also rebuked a Washington Post story that reported that the U.S. military killed two survivors of an initial boat attack on Sept. 2. Wilson maintained that the second strike was ordered by Adm. Frank Bradley, and that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “100%"" agrees with both strikes. 

“As the White House confirmed yesterday, the decision to strike the narco-terrorist vessel was made by Admiral Bradley, operating under clear and long standing authorities to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States was eliminated,” Wilson said.

Jeff Landry said he received that commitment from Trump himself.

“He said, ‘Don't worry Jeff, we'll have them there in two weeks,'” Landry said, recounting a Monday morning phone call with Trump. 

The governor, who spoke with reporters during an event honoring victims of the New Year's Day Bourbon Street attack, provided no additional details on the deployment.

Landry requested in September that the federal government send 1,000 guard troops, citing concerns about crime in some of Louisiana's most populous cities.

It's a district that Trump won by 22 percentage points in 2024, but House Speaker Mike Johnson joined other Republicans in tamping down expectations ahead of Tuesday's U.S. House special election in Tennessee.

“Special elections are strange animals and anything can happen,” Johnson said. “And when you're in a deep red district, sometimes people assume that the Republican, the conservative will win. And you cannot assume that.”

Johnson said at his Tuesday press conference that he spent nearly 10 hours in the district the day before, holding nearly a dozen events. Winning the race is both crucial for the GOP's narrow majority and viewed as a potential barometer ahead of next year's midterms.

Speaker Mike Johnson says “we didn't commit to that” when asked whether House Republicans would pursue a short-term extension of health care subsidies before they soon expire.

Johnson's comment comes as he spoke to reporters Tuesday. Some of the Republicans in key swing districts have been calling for a short-term extension to prevent premiums from soaring next year for thousands of their constituents. But time is running short as lawmakers wrap up their work before the holiday break.

Johnson said only a small percentage of Americans are affected by the subsidy increases kicking in next year for those on Affordable Care Act exchanges.

“All of this hullabaloo is over 7%. Now, every American, 100% of Americans need their health care costs to come down. Republicans have ideas to do that. Now, what I've got to do is build consensus deliberately around the best ideas.”

Most of the Pentagon's press corps turned in their access badges rather than submit to new rules restricting what they can report.

Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson is holding Tuesday's event with “invited press only” able to ask any questions. It's also being broadcast on the Pentagon's website, among other places.

The Pentagon's last on-camera press briefing was in June after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. This briefing comes amid increasing scrutiny of U.S. military strikes against alleged drug boats off Venezuela and reports that survivors of one attack were killed in what may have been a criminal act.

Several conservative news outlets and internet influencers agreed to the new press policy. Virtually all other media organizations declined to go along over concerns it will restrict them to reporting what Hegseth approves.

U.S.-operated flights returning deported migrants to Venezuela will continue despite Trump's assertion that the airspace of the South American country should be viewed as closed. 

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government announced Tuesday that the twice-weekly flights will go on Wednesday following a request from the Trump administration, reversing its Saturday announcement that U.S. immigration authorities had unilaterally suspended the flights.

More than 13,000 migrants have been deported to Venezuela this year on dozens of chartered flights after Maduro, under pressure from the White House, did away with his long-standing policy of not accepting deportees from the U.S. The flights have continued despite U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean and off Venezuela's Caribbean coast.

The president on social media called GOP candidate Matt Van Epps “phenomenal” and a “MAGA Warrior” who “cherishes Christianity and Country Music.”

Trump has repeatedly criticized the Democratic candidate, state Rep. Aftyn Behn, for comments she made about Nashville during a 2020 podcast in which she said “I hate country music.”

This combination image shows Aftyn Behn, left, Nov. 13, 2025, Nashville, Tenn. and Matt Van Epps, Nov. 12, 2025, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/George Walker IV, file)



Behn, who represents Tennessee's biggest city, which is considered the home of country music, said the GOP is trying claim she hates Nashville, and she's “not going to take the bait.”

“I've cried no less than 10 times in the Country Music Hall of Fame — the girl that just goes to the Ryman to hang out” she posted Nov. 20 in a Facebook video. “They're panicking because we're close to winning. Eyes on the prize, y'all. Let's go.”

A faith-based pregnancy center will ask the justices on Tuesday to block a state investigation into whether it misled people to discourage abortions.

The facilities often known as “crisis pregnancy centers” have been on the rise since the Supreme Court's conservative majority overturned abortion as a nationwide right in 2022. Most Republican-controlled states have been enforcing bans or restrictions on abortion, and some have steered tax dollars to the centers, which generally provide prenatal care and encourage women to carry pregnancies to term. 

Many Democratic-aligned states have sought to protect abortion access and some have investigated whether pregnancy centers mislead women into thinking they offer abortions. New Jersey's attorney general Matthew Platkin sent a subpoena to First Choice Women's Resource Centers for donor information. First Choice argues the investigation is baseless and the demand for donor lists threatens its First Amendment rights.

Brian Finucane, now a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group, said the U.S. is not in an armed conflict with drug cartels, and “the term for a premeditated killing outside of armed conflict is murder.

“Murder on the high seas is a crime,” he said. “Conspiracy to commit murder outside of the United States is a crime. And under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 118 makes murder an offense.”

The Pentagon's own manual on the laws of war describes a scenario similar to the Sept. 2 boat strike when discussing when service members should refuse to comply with unlawful orders: “For example,” the manual says, “orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal.”

Juan Orlando Hernández was serving a 45 year sentence for helping drug traffickers move some 400 tons of cocaine to the United States. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons confirmed Tuesday that he was released from a prison in Hazelton, West Virginia following a pardon from Trump.

“After almost four years of pain, of waiting and difficult challenges, my husband Juan Orlando Hernández RETURNED to being a free man, thanks to the presidential pardon granted by President Donald Trump,” his wife Ana García posted Tuesday.

Asked why he did it, Trump said Sunday that people in Honduras told him Hernández had been falsely accused in “a Biden administration set-up.”

The pardon injected a new element into Honduras' presidential election, possibly helping the candidate from Hernández' right-wing National Party as the vote count proceeded Tuesday.

Michael Schmitt, a former Air Force lawyer and professor emeritus at the U.S. Naval War College, said it doesn't matter whether the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels, as the Trump administration asserts — he says such a fatal second strike would have violated both peacetime laws and those governing armed conflict.

“I can't imagine anyone, no matter what the circumstance, believing it is appropriate to kill people who are clinging to a boat in the water,” said Schmitt. 

“It has been clear for well over a century that you may not declare what's called ‘no quarter' — take no survivors, kill everyone,” he said.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — A tanker carrying sunflower oil from Russia to Georgia was attacked in the Black Sea, the Turkish maritime authority said Tuesday, days after two Russian “shadow fleet” oil tankers were attacked by Ukrainian naval drones.

The Turkish Directorate General of Maritime Affairs said the MIDVOLGA-2 came under attack about 130 kilometers (80 miles) off the Turkish coast. The 13 crew members were unharmed and the vessel has not requested assistance. 

It was heading toward the Turkish port of Sinop, the maritime authority said in a statement on X.

On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke out against Ukraine's drone attack on two Russian vessels, the Kairos and Virat, saying it signaled a “worrying escalation” of the conflict.

“We cannot condone these attacks, which threaten navigational safety, life, and the environment, especially in our own exclusive zone,” Erdogan said in a televised address. “We are issuing the necessary warnings to all parties regarding such situations.”

Friday's attacks against the Kairos and Virat occurred inside Turkey's exclusive economic zone. Crew members on board both vessels were reported to be safe.

The OpenSanctions database, which tracks people or organizations involved in sanctions evasion, describes the vessels as part of a fleet of ships used to evade sanctions imposed on Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine has carried out successful naval strikes against Russian shipping during the war, particularly using explosives-packed marine drones. However, Ukrainian missions have previously largely been limited to the waters of the northern Black Sea.

FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) — A Tennessee congressional seat that President Donald Trump and Republicans have previously won with ease became the unlikely epicenter of the fight for Congress on Monday, as House Speaker Mike Johnson headlined rallies and former Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told Democrats they could be on the verge of a monumental upset. 

Trump even called in twice during the day to tell voters to back Matt Van Epps, the Republican candidate, in Tuesday's special election.

“The whole world is watching Tennessee right now, and they're watching your district,” the president said after Johnson put him on speakerphone during an event inside a garage stocked with vintage cars on a supporters' sprawling farm in Franklin. “It's a big vote and it's gonna show something. And it's gonna show that the Republican Party is stronger than it's ever been.”

A few hours later, Trump drove home the message in a virtual rally, the second he's held for Van Epps since the former Army helicopter pilot and state general services commissioner became the Republican nominee. 

The rush of attention on the reliably conservative 7th U.S. House Congressional District came as Trump hopes to rebound from recent Republican losses around the country. Democrats want a strong showing that could propel them in next year's midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.

Behn, a self-proclaimed “pissed-off social worker” and progressive community organizer from Nashville, sprinted through her final campaign stops, including the virtual rally with Gore, a Tennessee native, and Ocasio-Cortez of New York.




Gore said people are struggling with high costs for groceries and health care while Trump is running “by far, the most corrupt administration in history,” enabled in Congress by “way too many subservient cowards.”

“Having had the privilege of representing Tennessee in years past, I want to tell you that I have never seen the political tides shift as far and as fast as we're seeing them move in this election,” Gore said. 

Ocasio-Cortez said the competitive race shows that “anything can happen and that miracles can happen, including in Tennessee” with hard work.

Behn has been described by some state Democrats as “our very own AOC of TN,” a nickname that Republicans have harnessed to deride Behn as too far left for the district. 

“They're bringing in all their heavy hitters because they think they can flip this seat from red to blue,” Johnson told reporters. “That is not going to happen.” Johnson is trying to maintain a narrow majority in the House, and he said the race is for “all the marbles.”

Republicans have expressed concerns about turnout because early voting went into Thanksgiving week and Election Day follows the holiday weekend. Van Epps was supported by a phalanx of party leaders on Monday, including national chairman Joe Gruters, Gov. Bill Lee, and Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty.

“I think that Matt's going to be OK,” Hagerty said. “But it's not just winning. It's winning by a wide enough margin to send a real Tennessee message that we're not going to stand for this.”

Former Vice President Kamala Harris appeared in Nashville to rally voters last month while on a book tour, and national party chair Ken Martin visited as well. 

The 7th District is one of three seats redrawn in 2022 to erode the influence of Nashville, the state's largest city and a Democratic stronghold. Only about 1 in 5 of the 14-county district's registered voters are in Nashville. Last year, the district went to former GOP Rep. Mark Green by 21 percentage points and to Trump by a similar margin.

Behn has condemned Trump's tariffs and tax cut legislation, both of which Van Epps supports.

Republicans have tried to turn Behn's own words against her in television advertising, such as when she described herself as a “radical” or claimed to be “bullying” immigration agents and state police officers. A frequent target are comments Behn made about Nashville years ago, when she said “I hate this city” and complained about annoyances like bachelorette parties.

For the most part, Behn has answered questions about those remarks by redirecting to cost-of-living issues. But she has responded specifically about Nashville, saying she wants it “to be a place where working people can thrive” even if she gets annoyed at some tourist draws.

“The barrage of negative attacks is a result of the fact that they don't have a plan to address the rising cost of health care,” Behn said at a campaign event Monday.

Jalen Smalls, a Behn voter, said his primary concern is getting people's basic needs met, such as funding for schools, feeding children, supporting hospitals and maintaining roads.

“Those are the bare minimum of what people need in order to thrive, not just survive,” Smalls said.

John Rowenczak, meanwhile, said he is voting for Van Epps because he is concerned that the country is becoming too liberal. He said his primary concern is illegal immigration.

“I feel like Trump is doing a good job, and that's kind of the way we need to go,” he said. “We want to continue the Trump agenda in this district.”

The House Majority PAC has put $1 million behind Behn. Van Epps has been backed by more than $1 million from the Trump-supporting MAGA Inc. super PAC.

Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries predicted an unexpectedly close race.

“Republicans have already lost,” Jeffries said Monday. “The fact that they are spending millions of dollars to hold a seat that Donald Trump just won by 22 points is extraordinary.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Since last week's shooting of two National Guard members in the nation's capital by a suspect who is an Afghan national, the Trump administration announced a flurry of policies aimed at making it harder for some foreigners to enter or stay in the country.

The administration said it was pausing asylum decisions, reexamining green card applications for people from countries “of concern” and halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

Days before the shooting, a memo obtained by The Associated Press said the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration.

The stepped up effort to restrict immigration has been harshly criticized by refugee advocates and those who work with Afghans, saying it amounts to collective punishment. Critics are also saying it is a waste of government resources to reopen cases that have already been processed. 

The Trump administration says the new policies are necessary to ensure that those entering the country — or are already here — do not pose a security threat. 

Here's a look at the major changes announced over roughly a week:




The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said on the social platform X last week that asylum decisions will be paused “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

Besides the post, no formal guidance has been put forward, so details remain scarce about the planned pause.

People seeking asylum must show to U.S. officials a threat of persecution if they were sent back to their home country, whether because of race, nationality or other grounds. If they're granted asylum, they're allowed to stay in the U.S. and eventually apply for a green card and then citizenship. 

The Afghan suspect in the National Guard shooting was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.

The right to apply for asylum was already restricted by the Trump administration. In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order essentially halting asylum for people who have come into the country through the southern border. Those cases generally go through immigration courts which are overseen by the Justice Department.

USCIS oversees the asylum process for foreigners the government isn't trying to remove via immigration courts. While Trump's January order didn't affect those cases, Edlow's social media post suggests they will now come under additional scrutiny. Edlow did not say how long the agency's pause on asylum decisions would last or what happens to people while those decisions are paused.

Caseloads have been rising for all types of asylum applications. USCIS said there are currently 1.4 million pending asylum cases at the agency. Just a few years ago, in 2022, it was 241,280, according to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics. Separately there are about 2.4 million pending asylum applications in front of the Justice Department's immigration courts.

On Nov. 27, Edlow said his agency was conducting a “full scale, rigorous reexamination” of every green card for people he said come from “every country of concern.”

“American safety is non negotiable,” Edlow said.

The agency said in a press release that same day that it was issuing new guidance that could make it tougher for people from 19 countries the administration considers “high-risk,” including Afghanistan, when they apply for immigration benefits such as applying for green cards or to stay in the U.S. longer.

The administration had already banned travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 of those countries and restricted access for people from seven others. 

Other stricter stricter measures are also directed at Afghans.

On Nov. 26, USCIS said it would be suspending all “immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals.” That would affect Afghans already living in the U.S. who are applying for green cards or work permits or permission to bring family members to the U.S.

Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X that the State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports.

The Trump administration had already severely limited travel and immigration from Afghanistan. The one avenue that had remained open was the Special Immigrant Visa program. Created by Congress, it allowed Afghans who closely supported the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan and faced retribution because of their work to emigrate to America.

But the State Department's announcement means even that avenue is now closed.

According to #AfghanEvac, a group that advocates for Afghans coming to the U.S., about 180,000 Afghans were in the process of applying for the SIV program.

Even before the shooting of two National Guard members, the Trump administration was planning a sweeping review of tens of thousands of immigrants who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration as part of the U.S. Refugee Assistance Program. 

That program, first launched in 1980, oversees the process by which people fleeing persecution can come to the U.S. Refugees are distinct from people seeking asylum, although they meet the same criteria. Refugees have to apply and wait outside the U.S. to be admitted while asylum-seekers do so once they reach the U.S.

Trump suspended the refugee program the day he took office and only a trickle of refugees have been admitted since then, either white South Africans or people admitted as part of a lawsuit seeking to restart the refugee program.

Then on Nov. 21, Edlow said in a memo obtained by The Associated Press that the administration was going to review all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration. That's nearly 200,000 refugees.

Advocates say refugees already undergo rigorous vetting.

Late Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested in a post on X that more changes could be in the offing.

Noting that she had just met with Trump, Noem said she was recommending a “full travel ban” on countries she said were flooding the U.S. “with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

Noem did not specifically name any countries and no timeline was given. The Department of Homeland Security said in an email Monday, “We will be announcing the list soon.”

Luigi Mangione watched stoically Monday as prosecutors played surveillance videos of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing on a New York City sidewalk and of Mangione's arrest five days later at a Pennsylvania McDonald's.

NEW YORK (AP) — A Pennsylvania police officer responding to a tip from the manager of a McDonald's testified Tuesday about confronting Luigi Mangione during the intense manhunt last year for UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killer.

As soon as Mangione doffed his medical mask at the restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Officer Joseph Detwiler said, “I knew” he was the suspect whose face had been all over the news since the shooting five days earlier on a Manhattan sidewalk.

“It's him … I'm not kidding. He's real nervous, and he didn't talk too much,” Detwiler told a supervisor by phone from the restaurant parking lot moments after meeting Mangione, according to the officer's body-camera video. It was played in court Tuesday, the second day of a hearing about evidence in the case.

Mangione indeed said little initially to Detwiler and another officer, giving only what turned out to be a false name, home state and driver's license. But Detwiler testified that he'd noticed the man's fingers shaking as they interacted and officers patted him down.

Over the ensuing minutes, Mangione placidly ate a hash brown as the officers waited for colleagues and claimed they were simply responding to loitering concerns at the eatery.

“I was trying to keep him calm,” Detwiler told the court, adding that he at one point started whistling over the restaurant's holiday-season music to “make him think that nothing was different about this call than any other call.”

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Lawyers for Mangione, 27, want to block prosecutors from showing or telling jurors at his eventual Manhattan trial about statements he allegedly made and items authorities said they seized from his backpack during his arrest. The objects include a 9 mm handgun that prosecutors say matches the one used in the killing and a notebook in which they say Mangione described his intent to “wack” a health insurance executive.




The defense contends the items should be excluded because police didn't get a warrant before searching Mangione's backpack. They also want to suppress some statements Mangione made to law enforcement personnel, such as allegedly giving a false name, because officers started asking questions before telling him he had a right to remain silent.

The laws concerning how police interact with potential suspects before reading their rights or obtaining search warrants are complex and often disputed in criminal cases.

In Mangione's case, crucial questions will include whether he believed he was free to leave at the point when he spoke to the arresting officers, and whether there were “exigent circumstances” that merited searching his backpack before getting a warrant.

Detwiler testified that he never told Mangione he couldn't leave, nor mentioned the New York shooting. Defense lawyers, however, have argued in court filings that officers “strategically” stood in a way that prevented him from leaving.

Mangione, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison, while federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Neither trial has been scheduled.

Mangione's lawyers want to bar evidence from both cases, but this week's hearing pertains only to the state case.

Manhattan prosecutors haven't yet laid out their arguments for allowing the disputed evidence. Their federal counterparts have said in court filings that police were justified in searching the backpack to ensure there were no dangerous items and that Mangione's statements to officers were voluntary and made before he was under arrest.

Five witnesses testified on Monday, including a Pennsylvania prison officer who said Mangione told him that, when arrested, he had a backpack with foreign currency and a 3D-printed pistol.

Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind as the executive walked to a midtown Manhattan hotel for his company's annual investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. Prosecutors say “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase insurance industry critics use to describe how companies avoid paying claims.

Thompson, 50, worked at the giant UnitedHealth Group for 20 years and became CEO of its insurance arm in 2021. He was married and had children who were in high school.

Jurors hear evidence and witness testimonies in the murder trial of Brian Walshe, who has been charged with killing his wife in 2023.

Brian Walshe, the 50-year-old Massachusetts man accused of killing his wife after uncovering an affair between her and a friend in Washington, D.C., returns to court Tuesday for the second day of his murder trial.

Walshe's defense attorney, Larry Tipton, said during his opening statement Monday that Walshe found his wife dead in her bed but did not kill her. Tipton said evidence would show a ""sudden, unexplained death"" and that such a thing ""happens."" He denied the prosecution's allegation that his client was aware of Ana Walshe's suspected affair.

Walshe is accused of killing Ana, dismembering her and hiding her body — after searching the internet for information about the man she was seeing behind his back.

""The defense can argue that the search shows the awareness of a name, not that he knew about a romantic relationship,"" said Randolph Rice, a Maryland attorney and legal analyst who is following the case. ""That distinction matters because without clear knowledge of an affair, the state's motive theory gets a lot weaker.""

Walshe already pleaded guilty to lesser charges of misleading police and unlawful conveyance of human remains.

Cohasset Police Sgt. Harrison Schmidt will come back to the stand after prosecutors said they intend to continue questioning him and also to play about 40 minutes of additional excerpts from his interviews with Walshe prior to the defendant's arrest. 

Prosecutors played more than an hour of similar recordings Monday, in which Walshe spoke calmly with detectives with sporadic interruptions from his three children as their mother was unaccounted for in early January 2023.

Massachusetts State Trooper Nicholas Guarino, an expert on digital forensics, is expected to take the stand next and discuss Walshe's alleged Google searches, which included the name of the man involved in an affair with Ana, 39, and for information on how to dispose of human remains.

Guarino testified earlier this year in another high-profile Massachusetts murder trial, reading text messages sent between Karen Read and John O'Keefe. Read was acquitted of all homicide-related charges in the death of her former boyfriend, O'Keefe, and convicted of drunken driving.

Prosecutors have alleged two possible motives in the case. 

The first is that Walshe allegedly uncovered an affair between his wife and a Washington, D.C., realtor, who is expected to take the witness stand Thursday.

The other is that Walshe allegedly believed that if his wife was out of the picture, and he was the only caretaker for their three children, he could have a chance of avoiding prison in connection with a federal art fraud conviction.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses the D.C. National Guard ambush, broader concerns over Biden-era Afghan vetting and migration pauses from high-risk countries.

After an Afghan asylee allegedly shot two West Virginia National Guardsmen on Wednesday, President Donald Trump ordered U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow to commence a ""full-scale, rigorous reexamination"" of green-card holders from ""countries of concern.""

The directive highlights the legal avenues through which a green card — lawful permanent residence granted through an Adjustment of Status application — can be withdrawn, and those through which it cannot.

There are several major ways lawful permanent residency can be revoked.

Several immigration law firms — including Sedki and Rebecca Black — cite similar orders and descriptions on their sites, and related details appear across various federal webpages, but Fox News Digital did not find any single official source that consolidates them.

First, green-card holders can be placed in removal proceedings if they are convicted of certain crimes – including ""aggravated felonies"" such as murder, some serious sex and drug-trafficking offenses, as well as crimes involving moral turpitude like certain theft, fraud or violent-offense convictions, depending on the sentence and timing.

They can also lose their green cards over convictions connected to terrorism or espionage for foreign governments. Green-card holders also cannot vote in federal elections, and convictions connected to attempts to do so can also result in revocation of their residency status.

A second basis for withdrawal is evidence that the noncitizen obtained the green card through fraud or misrepresentation.

HOMELAND SECURITY TO SCAN MIGRANTS' SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS FOR ANTISEMITISM: 'NO ROOM FOR TERRORIST SYMPATHIZERS'

Examples include foreign nationals who used identity theft, lied on their applications, or omitted parts of their criminal history or prior contact with U.S. immigration authorities.

USCIS may also revisit Adjustment of Status applications for lawful permanent residents who became such through a marriage that ends in divorce within two years. The agency can revoke a green card if it is found the foreign national married a U.S. citizen strictly in order to achieve residency.

VETERANS GROUPS URGE TRUMP ADMIN TO CONTINUE AFGHAN ALLY SUPPORT PROGRAM AMID BUDGET CUT CONCERNS

Home address issues and questions arising out of where – including in which country – a green-card holder truly resides can also be grounds for revocation.

Lawful permanent residents must be just that: people residing permanently in the U.S. with a primary residence stateside.

Leaving the country for more than a year without obtaining a reentry permit can lead the feds to consider a green card abandoned. Changes of address within the U.S. must also be reported to USCIS.

While most people who would fall under the subsection have since died or would be in their 90s at the least, a Cold War provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) bars any noncitizen who, between March 1933 and May 1945, participated in or ordered persecutions under Germany's Nazi regime or in German-occupied territories.

Relatedly, any immigrant who has been affiliated with communism or any ""totalitarian party"" in another country, is also banned from holding a green card.

One avenue the Trump administration, however, may pursue as it commences a full-scale review of green-card holders from Afghanistan and other ""countries of concern"" is the final major way residency status may be questioned or revoked: what some firms describe as the public charge rule.

FEDERAL JUDGE IN MAJOR BLUE CITY BLOCKS KEY TRUMP MOVE ON REFUGEES: ‘NOT LIMITLESS'

According to various immigration law firms' websites, such residents relying too heavily on public assistance and government programs may find themselves in removal proceedings if they are ""deemed a public charge"" under the law – but with a key caveat.

Under the INA, simply receiving public benefits does not make a noncitizen deportable. They must have become a public charge within five years of admission ""from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen since entry."" This standard is rarely invoked.

Additionally, relevant to Trump's Afghan example, any noncitizen previously arrested or deported from the U.S., or removed as an ""enemy"" or at government expense in lieu of deportation, may not hold a green card.

'HE IS DELIVERING': TRUMP'S FIRST MONTH FLIPS SCRIPT ON RADICAL BIDEN-HARRIS BORDER POLICIES

Sections of the INA finalized in 1995 and 2025 also list other grounds of inadmissibility or deportability.

A noncitizen with a communicable disease of ""public health significance"" can be denied status, as can those with a ""mental disorder"" posing a threat, or individuals deemed ""drug addicts."" Polygamy is also a disqualifying factor.

TRUMP'S BORDER GROUND GAME IS OFF TO A FAST START. TO GUARANTEE CHANGE CONGRESS MUST DO 3 THINGS

While many of the Afghan refugees reportedly came with little to no documentation at the time of the mass withdrawal from Kabul, the INA also prescribes that foreign nationals who were never qualified to obtain full citizenship for various reasons are also ineligible for lawful permanent residence.

The administration could, potentially, investigate whether any of the largely unvetted noncitizens have disqualifying history and enforce that subsection of the INA against them.

While former President Joe Biden's Operation Welcoming Heroes was an official mission, 8 USC Sec 1182(a) 5(d) also lays out how ""any alien who is a stowaway is excludable."" That definition would likely be up to legal interpretation, as the current administration signals a no-holds barred audit of current green-card holders.

Federal law states that immigration officers must state the negative determination to the green-card holder, and list the specific provision under the law that their disqualification or rescission falls under.

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House, DOJ, DHS and officials at USCIS for comment and clarification on any of the major grounds collected for a green card's withdrawal.

In comments to CBS News, Edlow said his agency has followed the president's order and ""halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible. The safety of the American people always comes first."" 

Trump quoted the INA inasmuch as: ""Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.""

A University of Oklahoma student who received a zero out of 25 on an assignment regarding gender norms says she was targeted for her Christian beliefs, citing a scathing response from the teacher's assistant who doled out the grade.

A University of Oklahoma student who received a zero out of 25 on an assignment regarding gender norms says she was targeted for her Christian beliefs, citing a scathing response from the teacher's assistant who doled out the grade.

Samantha Fulnecky is a junior pre-med student at the Sooner State's flagship university.

""I was asked to read an article and give my opinion on the article, and the article was about gender binary and mental health and gender stereotypes, specifically in children, because it's a lifespan development class,"" Fulnecky told Fox News Digital. ""So I was asked to give my opinion and my reaction to the paper.""

Fulnecky and her classmates were tasked with writing a response to a scholarly article titled ""Relations Among Gender Typicality, Peer Relations, and Mental Health During Early Adolescence,"" summarizing results of a study about gender norms among middle schoolers and the social ramifications children may face for not conforming to gender norms.

Students were asked to provide a ""thoughtful discussion of some aspect of the article."" The assignment provided eight suggestions for how to respond, including, ""An application of the study or results to your own experiences,"" ""Your own thoughts about how development proceeds in the domain being researched in the article"" and whether the student thought the topic was worthy of further study.

""So I did this assignment the same as I would any other in that class, gave my opinion on gender binary and gender stereotypes and that, naturally my views are from the Bible and my Christian kind of worldview,"" she said. ""And so that's what I wrote about and I didn't think anything of it."" 

Fulnecky, citing her Christian beliefs, responded that traditional gender roles should be reinforced, not degraded.

""The article discussed peers using teasing as a way to enforce gender norms. I do not necessarily see this as a problem. God made male and female and made us differently from each other on purpose and for a purpose,"" Fulnecky wrote in her essay. ""God is very intentional with what He makes, and I believe trying to change that would only do more harm.""

""Gender roles and tendencies should not be considered 'stereotypes,'"" her essay continued. ""Women naturally want to do womanly things because God created us with those womanly desires in our hearts. The same goes for men. God created men in the image of His courage and strength, and He created women in the image of His beauty. He intentionally created women differently than men and we should live our lives with that in mind.""

Later in her essay, she denounced peers who conform to popular discourse on gender so they ""do not step on people's toes,"" adding that she thinks it is ""cowardly and insincere"" of those who do.

The essay refers to Genesis, the first book of the Bible, in which God created men and women, and says that women are intended to be men's helpers. She defined the Hebrew translation of ""helper"" — ""ezer kenegdo"" — as ""helper equal to [man],"" making the point that God did not make women subordinate to men.

""Society [is] pushing the lie that there are multiple genders and everyone should be whatever they want to be is demonic and severely harms American youth,"" the essay continued. ""I do not want kids to be teased or bullied in school. However, pushing the lie that everyone has their own truth and everyone can do whatever they want and be whoever they want is not biblical whatsoever.""

""Overall, reading articles such as this one encourage me to one day raise my children knowing that they have a Heavenly Father who loves them and cherishes them deeply and that having their identity firmly rooted in who He is will give them the satisfaction and acceptance that the world can never provide for them,"" the essay concludes.

RUTGERS PROFESSOR ALLEGEDLY SHOWS CLASS SLIDES ABOUT ‘GIRL'S PENISES,' 'GENDER UNICORN'

The grading rubric for the assignment indicates three criteria.

""Does the paper show a clear tie-in to the assigned article?"" is the first, worth up to 10 out of the assignment's 25 total points.

""Does the paper present a thoughtful reaction or response to the article, rather than a summary?"" is the second, also worth up to 10 points.

""Is the paper clearly written?"" is the last criterion, worth up to five points.

The paper was graded by graduate teaching assistant Mel Curth, who uses she/they pronouns. 

The teaching assistant gave Fulnecky a zero out of 25, along with an earful about ""empathy"" and evidence.

""And so then, about a week later, I received a zero on it from the teaching assistant, and he left submission comments saying that my work was offensive, that I need more empathy in my writing, things like if I'm going to argue against the consensus of every medical field. In every medical association in the United States, then I need empirical evidence to back that,"" she said.

Curth's response insisted that the grade had nothing to do with Fulnecky's beliefs, but criticized the essay for lacking empirical evidence, which was not mentioned as a requirement in the grading rubric. Curth also described the paper as ""offensive.""

""Please note that I am not deducting points because you have certain beliefs, but instead I am deducting point [sic] for you posting a reaction paper that does not answer the questions for this assignment, contradicts itself, heavily uses personal ideology over empirical evidence in a scientific class, and is at times offensive,"" Curth's response said.

Curth said that the concept of only two sexes is not backed by science.

""You may personally disagree with this, but that doesn't change the fact that every major psychological, medical, pediatric, and psychiatric association in the United States acknowledges that, biologically and psychologically, sex and gender is neither binary nor fixed,"" Curth said.

The teaching assistant also found Fulnecky's use of the word ""demonic"" to describe the idea of sex and gender on a spectrum ""highly offensive.""

""Additionally, to call an entire group of people 'demonic' is highly offensive, especially a minoritized population,"" Curth said.

""I definitely think that I was being punished for what I believe because I very clearly stated in my essay in my response to the article, I very clearly stated my beliefs and stated what — not just my beliefs — but what the Bible and what God says about gender and about those roles,"" Fulnecky said.

Fulnecky told Fox News Digital that when she challenged Curth on the grade, noting that the assignment directed her to provide her own subjective opinion on the article, the teaching assistant doubled down on the zero grade.

Fulnecky then escalated to the school's administration.

The university released a statement on social media on Sunday after Fulnecky's story went viral on social media.

""The University of Oklahoma takes seriously concerns involving First Amendment rights, certainly including religious freedoms,"" the statement said. ""Upon receiving notice from the student on the grading of an assignment, the University immediately began a full review of the situation and has acted swiftly to address the matter.""

The school said it ""acted immediately to address the academic issue raised by the student. College leaders contacted her on the day her letter was received and have maintained regular communication throughout the process.""

""As previously stated, a formal grade appeals process was conducted,"" the statement said. ""The process resulted in steps to ensure no academic harm to the student from the graded assignments.""

The university also announced that Curth has been placed on administrative leave.

""The graduate student instructor has been placed on administrative leave pending the finalization of this process,"" said the statement. ""To ensure fairness in the process, a full-time professor is serving as the course instructor for the remainder of the semester.""

Fulnecky, who said she doesn't believe conservative opinions are well-tolerated at the school, disagreed with Oklahoma's characterization of its own response, and said she found out about the action taken by the school from the social media post.

""So, the university is claiming that they've been in communication with me and that they gave me some sense of assurance that they wouldn't let this happen again,"" she said. ""But in reality, I had no idea. I didn't think they were going to do anything about the situation. And I honestly don't think they would have if it hadn't blown up on social media the way it did. I really was shocked to see that the university put out a statement about that saying that they have handled everything perfectly and trying to cover their tracks because they wouldn't have done that or even acted like they cared if it hadn't blown up like it did.""

Ryan Walters is the former Oklahoma superintendent of public instruction, who now runs the Teacher Freedom Alliance.

""Higher Ed. and K-12 schools, under the thumb of teachers unions, have infected an entire generation with their woke anti-Christian bias,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""Samantha Fulnecky is an American hero,"" he said. ""She stood firm in her faith despite the radical attacks from the Marxist professors at the University of Oklahoma. The OU staff involved should be immediately fired and OU should not be receiving taxpayer dollars if they continue their assaults on faith. The war on Christianity is real, and we will not be silenced.""

Fulnecky told Fox News Digital that she has received messages of encouragement and admiration from fellow students for standing up for her beliefs, but has also received hateful messages online.

She encouraged other students to stand up for what they believe.

""It can be pretty scary, but Jesus is always worth standing up for, and I just encourage those people that are dealing with something similar to push back against that kind of behavior and really fight for your university to change, because if we don't speak up about it, they're not gonna do anything to change it.""

""I mean, I would rather have my integrity and give my true opinion and get a zero on an assignment than have to lie about what I really believe,"" she said.

As for her message to Curth, Fulnecky said God loves the teaching assistant despite the grade.

""I think I would just say that God loves him and that I am saddened that they're offended by the truth of the gospel and the truth that I wrote about in my assignment, and it saddens me to see that that offends them and upsets them the way it did.""

Neither Curth nor the University of Oklahoma returned requests for comment.

Colin Cowherd lists his top 10 teams in the NFL entering Week 13, including the Chicago Bears, Kansas City Chiefs, and New England Patriots.

The mark of a good NFL team is their ability to put bad teams away with ease. The New England Patriots made a statement against the New York Giants on Monday night, 33-15.

Drake Maye and the Patriots offense made it look easy from the start.

He found Kayshon Boutte on a 3-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter to help take a commanding 17-0 lead. He then dropped an absolute dime to Kyle Williams on a 33-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter.

Maye's touchdowns helped the Patriots take a 30-7 lead into the locker room and New England didn't look back from there.

The second-year quarterback was 24-of-31 with 282 passing yards and two touchdowns. The Giants' defense was able to get to him three times. Patriots tight end Hunter Henry led the team with four catches for 73 yards.

Rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson had 67 rushing yards on 11 carries.

The Patriots' defense was able to keep rookie Jaxson Dart at bay for the most part. He was roughed up at points during the game, taking huge hits. He finished 17-of-24 with 139 passing yards and a touchdown pass to Darius Slayton. He added 20 yards on the ground.

The Giants had their share of head-scratching moments during the game.

YOUNGHOE KOO'S FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT GOES HORRIBLY WRONG AS SPECIAL TEAMS WOES CONTINUE FOR GIANTS

Kicker Younghoe Koo, somehow, got caught up in the field as he tried to kick a field goal in the second quarter. The Giants tried to make the most out of it, but Jamie Gillan was stopped before he could even think about throwing the football.

Earlier in the game, Dart took a couple of hits from the Patriots defense. First, linebacker Harold Landry III hit Dart near the helmet as he tried to avoid him. There was no penalty flag thrown on the play. On the following drive, Patriots linebacker Christian Elliss trucked Dart as he was running up the sideline. It sparked a brief skirmish and a penalty on Giants tight end Theo Johnson.

New York looked completely out of sync the entire game, underscoring why they are now a 2-11 team. The defense allowed big plays early and often and failed to stop Marcus Jones on a punt return. He returned one to the house 94 yards.

With the win, New England is back on top of the AFC with an 11-2 record and completed a feat not seen since the 1999 Indianapolis Colts. The Patriots are the first team with a 10-game winning streak after losing 13 or more games in the previous season.

Officers flooded a Port St. Lucie neighborhood after a police sergeant was shot in the face while responding to a service call tied to a mental health dispute, authorities said. (WPTV) 

A Port St. Lucie police officer was shot in the face while responding to a service call Monday evening, authorities said.

Six officers arrived at the home that was the source of the call at the 11000 block of SW Lake Park Drive around 6 p.m.

Within a minute of their arrival, the officers were met by an adult male holding an assault rifle outside the home. The suspect exchanged gunfire with the officers and was shot dead, Police Chief Leo Niemczyk said.

Niemczyk identified the injured officer as Sgt. Erik LeVasseur, a 27-year veteran of the department. None of the other officers who responded to the home were injured, Niemczyk said.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) announced on Monday that Florida will be the latest state to undergo redistricting efforts. 

DeSantis revealed his intention to call a special legislative session on redistricting in his state in the spring, between March and May, The Floridian reported. DeSantis said he was awaiting a decision from the Supreme Court before proceeding. 

“Yeah, yeah, so we're going to redistrict,” said DeSantis. “The issue is that there is a Supreme Court decision that we are waiting on — the argument in October about Section 2 of the VRA [Voting Rights Act] that impacts Florida's maps, so we're going to do it next Spring.”

He added that he intended to communicate with Republican state Sen. Ben Albritton on how to proceed with Florida's redistricting efforts. Albritton is the president of Florida's Senate for the 2024-2026 term. 

“I am going to talk to Sen. Albritton about when it makes sense to do it, but that will be done,” DeSantis said. “I think we are going to be required to do it because of this court decision.”

Florida House Speaker Danny Perez announced in September the creation of the Select Committee on Congressional Redistricting to assist in redrawing Florida's congressional districts, according to The Floridian. Miami Rep. Mike Redondo, a Republican, was named chairman of the committee and will be joined by 10 other representatives, including seven Republicans and three Democrats. The committee's first meeting is scheduled for Dec. 4.

WHERE REDISTRICTING STANDS A YEAR OUT FROM THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS

Redistricting efforts in states throughout the country began earlier this year when Texas announced it was redrawing congressional districts in a way projected to give Republicans an advantage and an additional five seats in the House of Representatives. In response, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) lobbied Democrats in the California State Legislature to conduct their own redistricting, leading to the Election Rigging Response Act, more commonly known as Proposition 50, being placed on the ballot in a special election in November. Voters in the state approved the policy proposal, allowing Democrats to gerrymander congressional districts.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Blame Democrats, not data centers, for rising electricity prices","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3902925/blame-democrats-not-data-centers-rising-electricity-prices/","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Healthcare and housing costs have dominated voters' concerns for decades, and soaring food prices under former President Joe Biden added to the burden. But new polling and the recent election results in New Jersey and Virginia show that electricity prices have emerged as another potent political issue. Democrats, eager to deflect blame, have settled on a new villain: data centers.

The problem with this argument is that data centers are not the primary cause of rising electricity prices, as a cursory review of local electricity markets shows. The real problem is Democratic energy policies that drive up electricity costs the fastest in states controlled by Democrats.

In an October survey, 2 in 5 consumers reported that electricity prices were a “major” source of financial stress. That is fewer than those who cite grocery prices, but is comparable with those pointing to housing and healthcare.

In the two high-profile statewide contests of 2025, Democrats prevailed while making the cost of electricity a defining campaign theme. In New Jersey, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) pledged to declare a “state of emergency on utility costs,” halt rate hikes, and impose tighter regulation on utilities. In Virginia, Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) blamed rising bills on data centers and promised stricter rules on their construction and the rates they're charged.

Absent from both these campaigns was any discussion of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which has pushed electricity prices higher across the Northeast. The initiative is a multistate program backed by Democratic governors that intentionally increases the cost of carbon-intensive electricity generation as a way to discourage emissions.

The program works by establishing a regional emissions cap and requiring power producers to buy allowances for every ton of carbon they emit. Because the cap declines over time, the price of allowances rises. Utilities then incorporate their new costs into the prices that electricity users, which is almost everybody, must pay. Because wholesale electricity markets set prices based on the highest-cost plant needed to meet demand, higher costs for gas and coal generators due to the regional initiative lift prices for all power on the grid.

Both New Jersey and Virginia are part of the RGGI, although Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) tried to remove his state from it after the Virginia State Corporation Commission concluded that it would add $2.39 billion to consumer electricity bills. Youngkin's efforts, unfortunately, were reversed by a state judge, and Spanberger has enthusiastically pledged to rejoin the agreement. Virginians are already paying the price.

In no state have electricity prices risen higher and faster in the past five years than in California, which is also one of the leading states for data center construction. But while it is tempting for Democrats to blame data centers for high and rising electricity prices, their propagandistic deflection from their own blame does not add up. Texas demonstrates why. The Lone Star State has added more data centers than California has, and yet it has below-average electricity prices that are rising more slowly than the national average.

That is because it has a better government and fewer regulations. Texas's formula for absorbing data center growth without triggering crippling rises in electricity prices is straightforward: avoid the costly climate policies adopted in California and under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. California not only imposes its own carbon cap, but it also requires utilities to sign long-term renewable contracts, often at above-market prices, forces them to buy rooftop solar power at inflated rates that shift costs onto traditional customers, and simultaneously drives up electricity demand through electric vehicle, appliance, and building electrification mandates.

WHEN WILL NEWSOM'S SPENDING BUBBLE BURST?

It is these climate policies, not data centers, that explain why California has the highest electricity prices in the country.

Sherrill and Spanberger will try to tax and regulate their way out of rising energy costs, even though it will mean slowing economic growth because it will limit data center construction. Republican-governed states such as Texas, in contrast, will keep drilling for gas and oil, build refineries and pipelines, and expand solar farms, transmission lines, and data centers that rely on them. By 2028, voters should have a clear record to judge which model works.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) blasted House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and House Republicans for Democrats seeking to block an amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act that Stefanik advocated. Her provision would require notifying Congress if the FBI investigates candidates running for president and other federal offices. She accused Johnson and the GOP of “getting rolled” by House Democrats in an X post on Monday.

Stefanik said she would vote against the legislation if her provision were not “added back.”

“Republicans have the House, Senate, and the White House, yet the deep state is alive and well with the Speaker getting rolled by House Dems attempting to block my provision to require Congressional disclosure when the FBI opens counterintelligence investigations into presidential and federal candidates seeking office,” Stefanik posted.

Stefanik cited the actions of former FBI Director James Comey during the “Russia Hoax” and the Arctic Frost controversy as reasons for the necessity of her amendment. She called such investigations and law abuses criminal acts that can “never happen again.”

🚨🚨🚨Republicans have the House, Senate, and the White House, yet the deep state is alive and well with the Speaker getting rolled by House Dems attempting to block my provision to require Congressional disclosure when the FBI opens counterintelligence investigations into…

“In a March 2017 open hearing, my questions to former FBI Director James Comey began the unraveling of the Russia Hoax when Comey admitted to not following proper notification procedures with his illegal opening of Crossfire Hurricane,” Stefanik said. “A criminal act that can never happen again.” 

“My provision will strengthen this accountability and transparency to deter this illegal weaponization and it passed out of the House Intelligence Committee in this Congress and previous ones,” Stefanik added. “Yet House Republicans continue to get rolled by the deep state due to opposition by Jamie Raskin. If Republicans can't deliver accountability and legislative fixes to arguably the biggest illegal corruption and government weaponization issue of all time, then what are we even doing.” 

She also cited the recent leaks of conversations between foreign governments and U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff. She emphasized that removing her provision would be detrimental to accountability and threaten national security. She also said it was necessary to prevent the “weaponization” of the federal government and intelligence communities.

WHITE HOUSE INSISTS ‘DOUBLE TAP' ON BOAT-STRIKE SURVIVORS IN CARIBBEAN WAS LEGAL 

“This language is even more essential in light of the continued weaponization of the federal government evidenced by the sweeping Arctic Frost wiretapping scandal and the recent illegal leaks of Steve Witkoff's conversations with foreign counterparts,” Stefanik said. 

“It is a scandalous disgrace that Republicans are allowing themselves to be rolled by the Dems and deep state on this,” Stefanik concluded.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Chicago Teachers Union has fallen years behind in fulfilling its obligation to provide members with an independent audit of its finances. While keeping the educators it represents in the dark, the union spent roughly $15.8 million supporting left-of-center political campaigns, according to public records. Now it faces a congressional investigation over its financial situation. 

Records show that the Chicago Teachers Union's most recent publicly available independent audit only covered the union's finances as of June 2019. The Republican-led House Committee on Education and Workforce, in a Nov. 20 letter, alleged that this “strips dues-paying members of their basic right to understand how their money is spent” and runs afoul of the organization's bylaws, which require such audits regularly. Since June 2019, the amount of money the union has given to liberal politicians and political action committees, other than its own, has been steadily increasing.

In 2019, the Chicago Teachers Union's political action committee, receiving funding from the union treasury, spent $1.7 million on donations to candidates for public office. That figure declined to $1.4 million in 2020, dipped slightly to $1.2 million in 2021, then rose to $1.9 million in 2022, exploded to over $3.6 million in 2023, and grew again to roughly $5 million in 2024, according to campaign finance filings.

Among the individuals to receive the most money from the Chicago Teachers Union while its members were barred from accessing independently audited financial information were Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D), the Illinois Federation of Teachers' PAC, and Chicago Board of Education member Ebony DeBerry. Some individuals that the Chicago Teachers Union threw the most money behind, such as school board candidates Jason Dones and Felix Ponce, who ultimately failed to win election to office. Johnson and DeBerry, meanwhile, have been staunch allies of the teachers union.

The lack of transparency from the Chicago Teachers Union spurred some members of the labor organization to sue it in October 2024, demanding an audit.

Critics have argued that union members may have good reason to be concerned about the state of the union's finances.

Analyses from the Illinois Policy Institute have found that the union spending on representational activities, operations associated with representing workers, declined from just 20% in 2024 to 18% in 2025. Furthermore, an inspector general's report released on November 12 found that Chicago Public Schools staff spent $7 million in COVID-19 relief funds on trips to international destinations, stays in luxury hotels, and Las Vegas conferences.

CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION GOT LAST-SECOND FUNDING FROM THE BIDEN EPA

“By withholding complete financial audits from its members, CTU has failed to uphold the spirit of union transparency or comply with its own bylaws,” the House Committee on Education and Workforce wrote in its November 20 letter to the Chicago Teachers Union. “As such, the Committee is investigating this matter to better determine whether the [Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act] should be amended to strengthen its requirements so that union members have access to more robust and timely financial information. Every dollar paid by workers should serve their interests, not those of a select few operating in the shadows.”

The Chicago Teachers Union, however, has agreed to cooperate with the committee's requests, though its lawyers insist that the investigation is a “waste of time.”

“We represent the Chicago Teachers Union in connection with the requests for documents contained in your letter of November 20, 2025,” a letter from the union's legal representation that was shared with the Washington Examiner read. ‘We will respond to the House Committee on Education and Workforce and cooperate with any legitimate requests. Indeed, we have already been in touch with Committee staff regarding the schedule for producing responsive documents and will produce them on or before December 22. We are confident that our responses will fully answer any legitimate questions and address the allegations contained in your letter.”

The letter further maintained that the union made its late financial audits available to members through an internal portal after the October 2024 lawsuit brought by its members regarding them.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

House Democrats opened an investigation Monday into FBI Director Kash Patel's use of a government jet, accusing him of repeatedly taking the aircraft on personal trips during the government shutdown and demanding that he reimburse taxpayers and turn over detailed travel records.

In a letter to Patel, House Judiciary Committee ranking Reps. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-IL) said flight records and internal accounts show Patel frequently used the FBI's Gulfstream G550 for nonofficial excursions. Their allegations also rely on social media posts and other news articles referenced in the letter.

The lawmakers say Patel used the FBI jet on Oct. 25 to fly to Pennsylvania for what they described as an overnight date, attending his girlfriend's performance at a wrestling event at Penn State University before flying with her to Nashville the next day. They also pointed to a report from the Wall Street Journal that Patel traveled to Boondoggle Ranch, a luxury Texas hunting resort, on the same weekend.

The letter further states that Patel responded to public scrutiny by firing Special Agent Steven Palmer, a 27-year veteran of the bureau who was then leading the Critical Incident Response Group, the division responsible for overseeing aviation operations and crisis deployments. The lawmakers linked the firing to subsequent instability inside CIRG, which they noted occurred just days before bomb threats at Reagan National Airport forced flights to halt for more than an hour.

Raskin and Kamlager-Dove further alleged that Patel attempted to conceal his future travel plans by removing the FBI jet from public flight-tracking systems, and then continued to fly to Nashville for personal reasons. They also cited allegations that Patel used government aircraft for a private golf trip to Scotland with several friends.  

The lawmakers are demanding that Patel produce records of all nonfederal passengers on FBI and Justice Department aircraft, reimbursements owed and paid, internal communications regarding travel, and justifications for each passenger.

They also want documents related to staffing decisions tied to aviation oversight and any discussions about acquiring new aircraft during the current administration. Their deadline for Patel's response is Dec. 15.

Patel has denied abusing government aircraft, saying he is restricted from commercial travel and reimburses the government for any personal use.

BONGINO DEFENDS FBI LEADERSHIP AMID SERIES OF NEGATIVE HEADLINES

Democrats have limited tools to compel Patel to act as Republicans control the Judiciary Committee. As the minority party, they cannot issue subpoenas on their own, schedule oversight hearings, or force document production without the chairman's approval.

As Millennials enter their Rogaine era, the hair-loss industry is eager to receive them.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Throughout the 2000s, the music charts were rife with references to Rogaine. Jay-Z invoked the hair-restoration drug as a synonym for staying power. Weezer described it, begrudgingly, as a means of rejuvenation. Ingrid Michaelson, in a song about accepting one's flaws, pledged to buy the drug for her partner when he inevitably lost his hair.

Now, as the Millennials who grew up on this music are fast approaching their Rogaine era, the hair-loss industry is eager to receive them—particularly the many women coming around to the idea that they might want to buy Rogaine for themselves too. Over roughly the past decade, hair-loss treatments aimed at women have broken into mainstream consumer culture, alerting women simultaneously to the possibility of balding and the potential to fix it.

Women have always been the target audience for shampoos, hair masks, hot-oil treatments, and so on. But those products aim to improve the appearance of existing hair, not grow more of it. Products specifically for hair loss have historically targeted male users. When Rogaine launched in 1988, it was available only for men. (The women's version came three years later.)

Advertising for hair loss has, accordingly, mostly focused on men. Throughout the big-hair craze of the 1980s and '90s, infomercials for men's spray-on hair were all over TV. In a Rogaine ad from 2001, a narrator asks: “Will she feel the same way if you lose your hair?” (The answer: “Sure, she'll just feel it about somebody else.”) Hair-growth treatments are an easy sell for men because many will go bald in midlife. Yet 40 percent of women experience some amount of hair loss by the time they turn 50. They just haven't been as comfortable talking about it as men, Rachael Gibson, a hair-culture expert known online as the Hair Historian, told me.

Now brands and their ambassadors have taken the microphone. Nutrafol, a women-focused hair-supplement company that launched in 2016, has started selling its products at Sephora and Ulta. My Instagram feed is full of female influencers holding up fistfuls of loose hair and presenting sparsely populated scalps—then hawking serums, supplements, and shampoos that supposedly restored their voluminous mane. (Before watching these videos, I had no suspicions that my hair was falling out; afterward, I was convinced that with the right products, I could look absolutely equine.) When Hers launched in 2018, it offered topical minoxidil, the generic form of Rogaine. Over the past three years or so, many providers (including Hers) have started prescribing oral minoxidil, a hypertension drug, off-label to treat hair loss, which can be a welcome alternative to sticky topical versions. Hers and its men's counterpart, Hims, also sell some of their hair-loss products at Walmart.

The proliferation of women's hair-restoration products is impossible to separate from the booming menopause market. As pop-culture depictions of menopause have become more prominent over the past few years, numerous drugs, supplements, and telehealth platforms have sprung up to address it. Shoshana Marmon, a dermatology professor at New York Medical College, told me that she has observed a growing number of influencers targeting women in midlife, when hair usually starts to thin. Midi Health, a menopause-focused telehealth platform, started offering oral and topical minoxidil in 2023, and it screens patients for common issues, such as iron deficiency and thyroid problems, that can drive hair loss, Kathleen Jordan, Midi Health's chief medical officer, told me. And because fluctuating hormones during menopause are a major driver of hair loss in women, hormone-replacement therapy can sometimes help.

Of course, hair-loss companies are ready to sell these products to anyone, not just aging women. In beauty chains and drugstores, numerous oral hair-loss supplements containing ingredients such as biotin and vitamin A are displayed alongside shampoos and conditioners. Last year, products for thinning hair and scalp health were among the fastest-growing categories in the roughly $450 billion prestige-hair-product market, according to the market-research firm Circana. Widespread hair loss during the coronavirus pandemic may have juiced demand for hair-loss products, and the rise of direct-to-consumer telehealth companies likely accelerated the trend: Hair-loss treatment is popular at Hims and Hers, a company spokesperson told me, because many people find hair loss embarrassing and telehealth allows them to seek help discreetly.

Read: The year America's hair fell out

The most commonly prescribed hair-loss drugs are well established and generally trustworthy. Minoxidil is the “gold standard” of active ingredients for hair loss, Paradi Mirmirani, a dermatologist with Kaiser Permanente, told me. In both topical and oral forms, it works by slowing or reversing hair-follicle shrinkage, which tends to happen as hormones fluctuate. A drug called finasteride is sometimes used to reduce shedding; Midi Health combines it with minoxidil and two less-used hair-loss drugs in a “Regrowth Serum.” But finasteride is most commonly prescribed to men; it isn't FDA-approved for women for hair loss, because it can be dangerous to pregnant women and their fetuses. (It has also been linked to panic attacks and suicidal thoughts in some men.)

Meanwhile, hair-loss supplements, like all supplements, are somewhat of a tangle. The highest-quality evidence available offers some support for swallowing ingredients such as zinc, pumpkin-seed oil, and omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, Elizabeth Houshmand, a fellow with the American Academy of Dermatology, told me. But purity, dosing, and consistency vary widely among products, and their safety and effectiveness aren't regulated by the FDA. Herbal supplements that lower DHT, a hormone that shrinks the hair follicle, can sometimes be beneficial, but medications are “the only thing that really does work,” Spencer Kobren, the founder of the American Hair Loss Association, a consumer-advocacy group, told me.

The predominantly male focus of the hair-loss industry, combined with women's reticence about thinning hair, has left many women clueless about the possibility that they, too, may lose their hair. “We hear all the time from our consumers that ‘I didn't know,'” Cindy Gustafson, the CEO of Nutrafol, told me. Some are too embarrassed to bring it up with their provider, fearing that their concern will be criticized as vain or, worse, dismissed as just a part of life, Jordan said. Unlike men, who are generally more aware of hair-loss drugs and use them as a first line of treatment, women tend to rely on trusted friends and hairstylists for advice, Kobren said, noting that they usually try four to six non-pharmaceutical hair-loss products before consulting a doctor. Unfortunately, he added, women also tend to spend the most on hair-regrowth snake oil.

Read: Soon there will be unlimited hair

Women today are in an unprecedented position: They're receiving more messages than ever about the possibility of balding, even as they're bombarded with products to fix it. Perhaps this shift will make women more comfortable taking their hair concerns to their doctor, rather than to friends and influencers. But it seems equally likely to change nothing. Like smooth skin and mental clarity, perfect hair suddenly seems within reach at any age—as long as you're willing to pay.

On Monday, Vox announced the launch of a major, multi-year editorial project exploring what it will take for the United States to restore its capacity to build — from new energy solutions, to upgrading transportation systems, to dramatically expanding the nation's housing supply.

The project stems from a clear diagnosis: America urgently needs to build — fast — and it needs to grow. Through ambitious, solutions-focused journalism, Vox will examine the policy, political, and practical challenges that shape the country's ability to construct the infrastructure and systems required for the 21st century. Coverage will delve into ideas and innovations that could unlock progress, including expanding electricity supply and modernizing the grid, improving and accelerating transportation projects, and growing housing availability to combat a decades-long shortage.

Vox received a grant from Arnold Ventures to support this project, though Vox retains full editorial control over all content produced as part of the project.

“Vox's explanatory and solutions-focused journalism has been at the forefront of some of the most consequential policy discussions of the last decade,” said executive editor Elbert Ventura. “This generous grant from Arnold Ventures will allow us to dig into some of the most pressing questions in policy, surface undercovered ideas, and inform the national conversation in this crucial moment in our politics.”

The initiative spans two major editorial packages, podcast series, live events, and a forthcoming newsletter product. Reporting and analysis will come from Vox's newsroom, as well as contributions from a diverse roster of freelance writers. The project aims to serve as a resource for lawmakers, government officials, policy thinkers, scholars, journalists, and others shaping the national conversation around America's capacity to build. But it also seeks to bring smart policy thinking and under-examined ideas to the wider public.

The first editorial package, The Case for Growth, is live today, with additional stories rolling out over the next month. This series will explore why the US turned away from a growth-oriented mindset and why doubling back down on growth — in energy solutions; in productivity; in technology; and ultimately, in the economy — is the only way out of a zero-sum politics that has paralyzed the country.

The second package, How They Built It, will debut in 2026. This case-study series will examine what the United States can learn from countries that have successfully built infrastructure faster, cleaner, and more affordably — and what it would take to apply those lessons at home.

The project will also include a Today, Explained podcast miniseries; an interview series on The Gray Area; a new newsletter focused on infrastructure and building policy launching in 2026; and a series of salon-style live events exploring these topics, taking place in 2026 and 2027.

Giving — it's in your blood.

Donating money isn't the only way you can help people. You can also give your blood.

Although approximately 62 percent of Americans are eligible to donate blood, only 3 percent do so each year. But someone needs blood every few seconds in the US. While the average red blood cell transfusion is about three units, a single car accident victim can need up to 100 units of blood.

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day. Sign up here.

However, as temperatures dip and the holiday season approaches, blood donations drop off dramatically. New York Blood Center Enterprises (NYBCe) — a community-based blood center which, despite the name, serves over 17 states and upward of 75 million people — regularly sees a nearly 50 percent drop in donations in the last few weeks of the year.

“We know everybody's schedules get really busy,” Diane Calmus, the vice president of government affairs at America's Blood Centers, told me. But people “continue to have babies and can hemorrhage. Car accidents continue to happen. Cancer patients continue to need treatment.” All of these situations require a continuous blood supply.

When you picture a blood donation, you're probably thinking of whole blood. It's the most flexible donation type and requires the least time commitment.

Blood is made up of four parts — plasma, white and red blood cells, and your platelets. You can donate these individually, but most donations are of whole blood, which comes directly from your veins. It can be transfused as-is to a single person rapidly losing blood, or separated out into red blood cells, plasma, and platelets to help up to three people.

While there are 48 recognized blood groups, the most important for transfusion are the ones you're probably already familiar with: A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O-. There's a very good chance that anyone reading this is likely O+. Outside of some countries in Europe and Asia, it's the most common blood type in the world. About 38 percent of Americans, myself included, have O+ blood. Black and Latino Americans are more likely to be O+ than white and Asian Americans.

Your blood type is genetic, and some people have extremely rare blood types. People with these rare blood types can only receive blood from others with the same type, which is a problem because there are so few donors, and you can suffer severe medical complications and even die from receiving incompatible blood.

Getting people to donate isn't easy. It's hard when you're busy to go out of your way to a donation site. And so making donation more convenient for volunteer donors is crucial. I, for one, have mostly donated through school- or workplace-based drives.

Even then, giving your blood takes time. After registration, donors undergo a health screening. You'll also be asked questions about your health and travel history, and you may be deferred if you've recently traveled to a place where bloodborne infections like malaria are common. Most deferrals are not permanent, but many people do not return after being turned away.

Some people are afraid of needles, and there's no way to get around that for a blood draw (although I can attest that it doesn't really feel like more than a brief pinch, and the needles are safe, single-use, not that big, and clean).

Blood centers always seek new donors, and while they don't pay people for blood used for transfusions in the US, that doesn't mean there are no gift incentives. Maybe you've gotten messages asking you to donate blood before a certain date to receive an e-gift card, clothing item, or chance to win a vacation package.

People give all sorts of reasons why they don't donate, often based on misconceptions about the process, but “the number one reason people don't donate is because they weren't asked,” said Nakul Raykar, a trauma surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the chair of the Blood D.E.S.E.R.T Coalition.

So consider this an ask.

﻿Giving away your money can feel great, if you do it right.

As the writer of an ethical advice column, I get a lot of questions from people who really want to do good in the world but are running into problems.

They want to know how to give charity — and how to do it optimally. They want to know if they should be pressuring their parents to donate more. They want to know if there's such a thing as helping too much or too little. And they want to know about ways of doing good that aren't about giving money at all.

So, in honor of Giving Tuesday, I've combed through all the advice I've given over the past year and created this cheat sheet for you. It's packed with my top tips, as well as my favorite quotes about the philosophy of doing good.

I grew up in a family on welfare. We always had housing and enough to eat, but we couldn't afford frills. I put every penny I got straight into a savings account, and my child-brain whined with anxiety when I saw my dad occasionally donate to others (what if we need that money?).

As an adult, I was lucky to get jobs that paid decently. But ,I kept grappling with money dysmorphia — feeling nervous about money even after becoming financially stable.



So, believe me when I say, I understand that giving away your money can be scary.

Here's what I did: I started small. I gave $10 here, $50 there, until, eventually, I was donating thousands of dollars each year. It helped that rigorous charity evaluators had come on the scene, so I could feel confident that certain nonprofits would put my money to good use. And it helped to learn that even a modest donation can do serious good. For just $94, say, you can keep a child from starving.

To my surprise, my initial fear ended up giving way to a wild, leaping joy. Giving felt so good, not only because I knew it was helping others, but because it reminded my brain that I'm not a solitary, atomized being; I'm connected to everyone else. As weird as it may sound, Giving Tuesday actually became one of my favorite days of the year.

The British philosopher Derek Parfit once beautifully described his own experience undergoing this shift:

I seemed imprisoned in myself. My life seemed like a glass tunnel, through which I was moving faster every year, and at the end of which there was darkness. When I changed my view, the walls of my glass tunnel disappeared. I now live in the open air. There is still a difference between my life and the lives of other people. But the difference is less. Other people are closer. I am less concerned about the rest of my own life, and more concerned about the lives of others.

I'm very grateful that we have charity evaluators whose entire job it is to find the nonprofits that genuinely do a lot of good with each dollar. Some nonprofits are much more effective than others trying to achieve the same goal, and all things being equal, we don't want to blow all our money on the wildly ineffective ones.

So, optimization definitely has its place in the world of charity, and I recommend giving generously to the “best buys” for improving people's well-being. But, I would caution you not to stretch optimization beyond its optimal limits.

If you want to optimize something, you have to be able to run an apples-to-apples comparison — to calculate how much good different things do in a single currency, so you can pick the best option. But helping people isn't reducible to one currency; it comes down to lots of incommensurable goods. How do you compare, say, preventing malaria with alleviating depression? Saving lives versus improving them? Or saving the life of a kid versus saving the life of an adult?

There is no objective One True Answer here. How to rank these different goods depends on each person's subjective philosophical assumptions. So, we need to give up the fantasy that there's some magic formula that can tell us how to optimize “the good” overall.

That doesn't mean anything goes, or that every charity is equally worthy of your money! It means the best you can do might be to consider how compelling you find the case for each one and divvy up your budget accordingly.

For example, I give about 85 percent of my charity each year to highly cost-effective organizations abroad like GiveDirectly and StrongMinds, because I know my money goes further in developing countries and I believe all lives are equally important. But, I also reserve a smaller amount for other things I value: a national homelessness organization, a social justice group, a media outlet, my meditation community, a group trying to preserve an endangered language.

Notice that some of these don't submit easily to quantification, and some aren't about furthering strictly “moral” goods. I think they're important anyway.

One of my touchstones is contemporary philosopher Susan Wolf's concept of the “moral saint” — someone who tries to make all their actions as morally good as possible.

Wolf argues that this is actually a bad ideal. We often think of “virtue” as being connected to morality, but Wolf's point is that there are also non-moral virtues, like artistic beauty. If you ignore those, you end up bereft of the things that make up a life well lived:

If the moral saint is devoting all his time to feeding the hungry or healing the sick or raising money for Oxfam, then necessarily he is not reading Victorian novels, playing the oboe, or improving his backhand. A life in which none of these possible aspects of character are developed may seem to be a life strangely barren.

I think that holds true both for how you spend your time and how you spend your money.

I encounter a lot of people who give so much of their time and money that they become overextended and resentful. Pop psychology would say these people need to get better at asserting “personal boundaries” — at drawing a sharp line between themselves and others. But, if you believe, as I do, that we're all actually profoundly interconnected and interdependent, then that idea of boundaries may feel like an unconvincing reason to practice self-preservation.

Instead, I think it's better to picture yourself as part of Indra's net. According to that classic Buddhist metaphor, an infinite net stretches out across the universe (a bit like a spiderweb). At each node where the threads intersect, there's a jewel (a bit like a dewdrop that sits on the spiderweb). Allan Watts, an American popularizer of Eastern philosophy, described it beautifully:

Imagine a multidimensional spider's web in the early morning covered with dew drops. And every dew drop contains the reflection of all the other dew drops. And, in each reflected dew drop, the reflections of all the other dew drops in that reflection. And so ad infinitum. That is the Buddhist conception of the universe in an image.

Because each dew drop (or jewel) contains the image of every other dew drop (or jewel) in the entire net, none of them exists as a separate, boundaried entity. Change one, and all the others change, too.

So, if you mess up your own well-being, you're diminishing one of these intrinsically precious bright spots. You're also diminishing every other bright spot in the net. That is not morally praiseworthy.

Giving money to charity can do a lot of good. That doesn't mean it's the only way to do good.

One of the most striking recognitions of this can be found in the Islamic tradition. The religion places a high premium on monetary charity, known as zakat. But, there's another form of giving: sadaqah. The Hadith, a collection of the sayings and traditions of the prophet Muhammad, contains a poetic explanation of sadaqah:

A sadaqah is due for every joint in each person on every day the sun comes up: to act justly between two people is a sadaqah; to help a man with his mount, lifting him onto it or hoisting up his belongings onto it, is a sadaqah; a good word is a sadaqah; and removing a harmful thing from the road is a sadaqah.

In other words, sadaqah comes in many shapes and sizes; it's broader than mere charity. It's what I would call solidarity. And notice how it's arguably even more morally demanding than monetary charity. All charity requires is writing a check — an action that can be done dispassionately, and even effortlessly for someone lucky enough to have money. It doesn't require commitment to a broader project of solidarity or justice. In fact, a common critique of charity is it can serve as a distraction from the unjust ways that wealth is created. But sadaqah requires you to be engaged, emotionally and often physically, too.

So, if you know people who don't donate money to charity, by all means, encourage them. Research suggests the most effective way to do this is to meet them with positive regard and empathy (not pressure or judginess) and to emphasize the joy you get out of giving (not the moral case for it). But above all, don't assume that they're not already doing a lot of good. They may be engaged in a different but equally valid practice of solidarity.

A billionaire's spiritual guide to letting go — of $19 billion.

Every time a MacKenzie Scott grantee talks about receiving one of her multimillion-dollar gifts, there is always a hint of the same bashfulness, the same reverence, and the same glee.

Their eyes light up. They blush a little. There's a giggle here and there.

“It's disarming,” said Michael Lomax, head of the United Negro College Fund, or UNCF, from the moment you get the call from her team. It starts with a message of gratitude from Scott, who became a multi-billionaire overnight after her divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2019. Then, the call pivots to a few logistics, and finally, the reveal of a large, generous gift that seems far too spontaneous to be true.

I knew that MacKenzie Scott was a novelist, but I had no idea how far her lore went with her former mentor, the famed author Toni Morrison.

Once you begin to see Scott as Morrison's mentee — rather than as a certain Amazon founder's ex-wife — you can't unsee it. As the rare writer-turned-billionaire, she gives more like an artist would, one source told me, than like the tech founders or old money heirs more commonly found in her class.

“Maybe this isn't real. Maybe this is a hallucination,” Lomax thought when he hung up the phone with Yield Giving, Scott's philanthropic arm a few months back.

But sure enough, when he finally found the follow-up email that, for days, got lost in cyber-purgatory, there it was. A gift from Scott, grantees say, is like getting a warm, fuzzy hug — only to find that when you pull away, someone's slipped $100 in your pocket.

Or, in Lomax's case, $70 million.

Since 2020, Scott has given away over $19 billion to more than 2,400 nonprofits that support causes like racial justice, education, and economic mobility. This year alone, she has donated more than $700 million to over a dozen historically Black colleges and universities, institutions that rarely receive major funding from other billionaire philanthropists and foundations.

As philanthropic grants go, this is major league. But what makes Scott unique in an age of impact reports and optimized metrics is not just the size of her gifts; it's her strategy.

Lately, MacKenzie Scott has been thinking a lot about birds. In her most recent essay, she asks readers to consider starlings, who fly in egalitarian tandem, taking shape as they may, unsure exactly where they will land.

Scott wants us to be more like starlings: to give with the flow. If most billionaire philanthropists come across as paternalistic, dictating where their donations should go and how they should be used, then Scott prefers to humble herself as one in a flock of interconnected birds, committed to ridding herself of “a fortune that was enabled by systems in need of change,” as she wrote in 2021.

Scott, it seems, believes that we are all fundamentally overthinking charity. If we could trust in one another enough to just hand over the damn money already, we could help a lot more people a lot more quickly. We will never know how many millions may have died from hunger or highly preventable health conditions, because solutions were slowed down by months, if not years, of billionaire wealth hoarding and bureaucratic red tape around giving.

“What if acts of service that we can feel but can't always measure expand our capacity for connection and trust?” Scott wrote last month.

To be clear, Scott does not actually hand out multimillion-dollar donations on a whim. At Bridgespan, she's got a whole nonprofit vetting team, which offers consulting services for philanthropists and nonprofits hoping to maximize their impact, on call. But it's notable that she appears to want people to think she does. She constantly reminds us to romanticize the uncertainty that comes with handing out large sums of cash to the people and places you believe in, no strings attached.

“This is a very loving kind of giving,” said Lomax, one that reflects “the love we have for other human beings.”

And maybe, just maybe, this very atypical billionaire can teach us all something about how to be a bit more fearless in the way we give and in using our gut as our guide without expecting anything in return.

Scott's blasé, hands-off approach to philanthropy has naturally made her a kind of fairy godmother in the collective nonprofit psyche. The notoriously private Scott, who has not given an interview to the press since she was promoting her second novel in 2013, could not be reached for comment.

In the early years, some grantees didn't even know who she was before they got the congratulatory phone call: “MacKenzie Scott thanks you for your work. Here's $10 million. Do with it what you will.”

Just about everyone knows MacKenzie Scott's name now.

“What holds a lot of major donors back is this fear of making a mistake or being inefficient, or giving away money and not having an impact,” said Priya Shanker, head of the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society. The rich are often too anxiously attached to their cash to give as generously as they probably should.

But Scott has shown “that there are enough worthy causes and enough worthy institutions that can put this money to good use” without overthinking it too much, Shanker said. “You just have to do it,” she added.

Scott often connects her giving to her own early experiences being on the receiving end of generosity. She grew up wealthy, attending a fancy prep school before her father's business took a turn for the worse as a teen. The generosity of friends and strangers — the dentist who gave her free care or the classmate who lent her $1,000 for tuition — helped shepherd her through Princeton, where she found a lifelong mentor in the future Nobel Prize-winning novelist Toni Morrison.

It was Morrison whose recommendation helped Scott clinch her the job as an associate at a hedge fund after graduation in 1992. She got the gig to bankroll her real vocation: her writing career.

But instead, she fell in love with the senior executive next door. Scott and Bezos wed six months later, and when he decided to move to the West Coast in 1994 and open an online bookstore, she went with him. Though she was a key contributor early on, as the bookstore ballooned into an e-commerce giant, Scott receded away from her corporate role and into her writing and motherhood, publishing two novels — one of which Morrison praised as a “rarity” that “breaks and swells the heart” — and raising four children.

By the time she and Bezos split in 2019, Amazon was valued at over $900 billion, and her 4 percent stake in the company — worth almost $36 billion at the time of their settlement — instantly made her one of the wealthiest women in the world.

One month later, Scott signed the Giving Pledge, which commits signatories to give away half their wealth in their lifetime or in their will. “Do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book,” she quoted the author Annie Dillard in a letter vowing to give away most of her wealth. She then turned the advice on her philanthropy: “It will take time and effort and care. But I won't wait. And I will keep at it until the safe is empty.”

The crazy thing is, she's actually doing it. Almost 13 percent of her fellow billionaires have signed the Giving Pledge. But, so far, almost none of them have given at a comparable rate despite seeing their fortunes swell over the past decade.

MacKenzie Scott's ex-husband, her passenger prince on their road trip from New York to the Bellevue garage where Amazon was born, has not signed the Giving Pledge at all. He is much wealthier than she is, but he gives away far less each year. And when he does give, he gives like the rest of the billionaires do — with a whole lot of strings attached.

To understand what makes Scott special, you need to understand how other billionaires give.

If a nonprofit wants money out of Bill Gates, for example, they typically need to go through his foundation and apply for a grant, outlining a specific project proposal and budget. Then, they wait. If they're chosen, more reporting requirements kick in. Getting your hands on even a small gift is often a total slog, an onerous months-long process involving tons of paperwork.

There are real benefits to this more cautious approach, like ensuring that the money gets where it's intended to go and maximizes impact once it's there. The Gates Foundation has used this method to dramatically expand access to vaccines and health care in poor countries, contributing to major reductions in child mortality and infectious diseases.

But, there are also some unintended drawbacks. Smaller nonprofits often struggle to make it through the slog at all, and even well-resourced groups say that these grant bureaucracies eat up an ungodly amount of staff time.

But, on the surface at least, Scott gives more like, dare I say, a normal person. She sees it. She likes it. She donates. It's one-click philanthropy.

“Not only are nonprofits chronically underfunded, they are also chronically diverted from their work by fundraising, and by burdensome reporting requirements,” she wrote in 2020, adding that, because her advisory team's preliminary “research is data-driven and rigorous, our giving process can be human and soft.”

Earlier this year, Gaby Pacheco was playing viola in a music shop in Manhattan when she got the Scott call. Her organization, TheDream.us, which offers scholarships to undocumented students, will use their gift to strengthen their work at a time when other donors have been pulling back.

It was like finding out you're pregnant after trying for years, and “you want to run to somebody to enjoy that moment,” said Pacheco. “It is just a joy that you cannot contain for yourself.”

For hours, Pacheco wrote and rewrote her email telling students and alumni about the gift, trying to perfect it into an embrace amid “all the terrible things in the world right now, the fear, the anxiety, all the madness around immigration,” she said.

“I wanted them to know that that's not how everyone feels,” said Pacheco. “That somebody's looking out for them and seeing that they're valuable, they're worthy, they belong.”

What Pacheco experienced was trust-based philanthropy, an approach that aims to flip the normal top-down script of giving on its head by asking donors to cede some of the power they wield over grantees. It's an approach that Scott has embraced wholeheartedly.

“It's about trying to seat ourselves in the experience of the people who are feeling the most challenged by the system,” said Pia Infante, who helped coin the phrase over a decade ago and co-leads the Trust-Based Philanthropy Project.

In practice, that means removing burdensome requirements like lengthy financial audits and strict restrictions on where grant money can be used. It also means respecting the expertise of those closest to the issues they're trying to address, like a person who has experienced hunger who now leads a food bank.

The pressure to impress donors sometimes warps into a race to become the most performative charity possible, which doesn't always make them the most effective one, says Infante. Smaller charities, including highly impactful ones, frequently don't have the time or expertise to compete for funds.

Pacheco and her staff often spend half of their time filling out impact reports for donors. Sometimes, they'll spend months applying for a grant that never pans out.

“I believe in measurements and evaluation,” she said, but “when you are chasing dollars, you start losing focus on your mission, because you have to conform yourself to whatever that foundation cares about” instead of what's best for your community.

This is not, by any means, an admonishment of data-driven philanthropy. As we often write about here at Future Perfect, meticulously measuring charity has done a lot of good in the world. It is a great way to seed super effective interventions like Taimaka's fight against child malnutrition and anti-malarial, insecticide-treated nets.

In fact, some of Scott's own grantees have reams of data to back up their work. The Malaria Consortium, named one of GiveWell's most impactful charities last year, received $10 million from Scott in 2023. She's donated $20 million to Evidence Action, which researches low-cost health interventions, and $4 million to Food4Education, a pioneer in cost-effective school meals.

And GiveDirectly, a darling of the effective altruism movement for its use of no-strings-attached cash transfers to fight poverty, has gotten well over $120 million from Scott since 2020.

That's not surprising, really, given that Scott, too, prefers to give directly to her grantees, without the pomp and circumstance that most billionaires require.

“We assume that because someone's acquired wealth or power, that they have a lot of knowledge about many things,” said Elisha Smith Arrillaga, vice president of research at the Center for Effective Philanthropy. “What this kind of giving does is it privileges the knowledge of people living in communities.”

In a three-year survey of over 800 of Scott's grantees, Smith Arrillaga found, as you'd expect, that almost every organization was better off financially a few years after receiving their gift and their self-reported impact grew significantly.

Still, while it might seem hard to imagine, there can be drawbacks to being suddenly showered with cash. Scott's skeptics point out that some charities may not be equipped to deftly manage a huge infusion of cash. And while most have in fact been able to absorb their gift strategically, there are a handful of exceptions.

Last year, the Philadelphia-based nonprofit Benefits Data Trust suddenly shuttered operations just two years after receiving a $20 million grant from Scott. “It was not a secret that these multimillion-dollar grants had expiration dates,” one former staff member told me for a piece I wrote for The Chronicle of Philanthropy.

But leaders squandered the gift, investing heavily in a couple of costly AI chatbots to nowhere and straying so far from their original mission that, prior to the closure, one senior philanthropy manager resigned after they could no longer “account for where the money was going.”

”I don't think you get responsible giving without some element of due diligence,” said Joanne Florino, a fellow at Philanthropy Roundtable, who's been critical of trust-based philanthropy for rhetoric that she sometimes characterizes as “really extreme” for telling donors “don't ask any questions; just give us the money and then go away.”

But, most experts say this misses what donors like Scott actually do with their cash. She's not writing blank checks to random organizations. She's just doing her homework differently and lightening the load for nonprofits on the other end.

And though there is still plenty of research on the backend, her process has clearly succeeded at moving a lot of money at a much faster rate than most of her peers. It comes at a moment of intense need, and with an urgency that few other donors of her class seem to grasp.

“There is this misconception that trust-based philanthropy is not strategic,” said Shanker, the head of the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society. “What trust based means is that it does away with these additional layers of administrative and bureaucratic burden that foundations and donors were putting on nonprofits,” she said, but “you can still be strategic.”

So, what does this mean for the rest of us who don't have billions to give away?

Lomax, the head of UNCF, has never met MacKenzie Scott. He'd love to one day, if only to say thank you. But he did know her mentor, Toni Morrison, and he thinks that connection matters.

Just as reading a novel asks you to empathize with “someone on the outside, someone who has been marginalized,” Lomax sees Scott's form of giving as one which “calls upon the giver to enter the life of the person they're touching” and to connect to their own personal experience.

“We've been going through this period of impact philanthropy, where I've got to run the numbers before I decide what I give,” said Lomax, a former literature professor who's had to learn to crunch numbers on the job.

“I'm not questioning it. I've learned to live in that world,” he said. But, at the same time, with Scott's gifts, “it's so beautiful to see a return to a very human impulse to just help somebody,” he added.

And nurturing that human impulse, he says, has rarely been this important.

A full one-third of US nonprofits have lost funding from the federal government under the Trump administration, and many have had to cut services and lay off staff. Organizations working abroad have, in some cases, faced even steeper cuts.

It's easy to get overwhelmed by it all. As Infante put it, “When everything's on fire, how do I know where to point my hose?”

What would MacKenzie Scott do? Well, she would probably call up her vetting team. But, if you don't have one of your own, you can mooch off of their work by perusing her website, where she lists every charity she's donated to since 2020.

But, better yet, do the research yourself. The key here is to start off by recognizing that there is a surplus of organizations doing good for the world that are deserving of your generosity. Let yourself be moved by the charities and causes that resonate with you the most, whose leadership you trust, and whose work you think you can connect to for the long haul.

Do some vetting, of course, but don't get so dragged down by that process that you spend more time on amateur sleuthing for the “best possible charity” than you do on actually giving back.

And, finally, if you can afford it, give big. One of Scott's trademarks is giving large gifts that represent a huge swath of a grantee's budget. We're talking tens of millions of dollars for a group like UNCF.

But, most local nonprofits are actually extremely tiny, with budgets of under $500,000. For them, even a relatively small donation may be just as transformative as Scott's blockbuster gifts.

Many of us could probably afford to spread our generosity further than we do now. Instead of only impulse buying sweater vests on Depop and tiny carrot scissors to stick on the fridge, I am actively trying to impulse hit that donation button more often this winter.

Not only for the causes that I care about, but for myself. Data-driven or not, charity was never meant to be purely transactional.

﻿Why the American dream stalled — and how to restart it.

For the past few years, American politics have been organized around a simple, unnerving feeling: Life is getting too expensive, and no one seems to know what to do about it.

Rent and home prices feel out of reach. Child care feels like it costs as much as a second mortgage. Groceries, utilities, and health care have all climbed faster than people's paychecks. Politicians have reached for familiar tools — blaming corporate “greedflation,” flirting with price controls and tariffs, promising to “take on” whoever is convenient in an election year — but none of that gets to the deeper question: How do we make it genuinely easier to build, to work, and to live well in America?

For most of this country's history, we thought we knew the answer: growth. That means a bigger economy, higher productivity, cheaper and cleaner energy, new technology, and more people able to participate in all of the above. Growth was the background assumption — not a panacea, but the thing that made every other problem a little easier to solve.

Then, beginning in the 1970s, that consensus started to break. Economic growth slowed. Concerns about inequality, consumerism, and environmental damage mounted. A certain anti-growth mentality took root on both the left and the right, and “more” became something to be eyed with suspicion rather than embraced and steered.

There were real reasons people were wary of a political project organized around “more” — the environmental damage of fossil fuels, the experience of being left out of past booms, the sense that consumerism had filled our lives with stuff instead of meaning. But, in overcorrecting for the very real mistakes of the past, the US inadvertently locked itself into a low-growth, high-friction status quo that has only made our hardest problems harder. That's why we need to take sustainable growth seriously again, to move from zero-sum fights over who gets what slice of a fixed pie to a world where the pie is actually bigger. Not growth at all costs, but growth the smart way.

That is the animating idea behind this project, The Case for Growth. Over the coming weeks, in explainers, features, and podcast episodes, we'll look at why our most productive cities have been effectively locking out families and what it would take to open them up. We'll imagine what an era of clean energy abundance could unlock, from vertical farming to sci-fi climate solutions. We'll explore how advances in artificial intelligence might finally shake us out of a prolonged productivity slump and how our addiction to cars and meat is choking off more sustainable growth. We'll talk to experts who make the case that growth can run side by side with policies that prevent the worst of global warming.

In an era when so much of our politics has been reduced to zero-sum arguments over who loses so someone else can win, we want to reopen the possibility of positive-sum progress — of building more; inventing more; and including more people in that story, while taking care of the planet. Growth won't solve everything, but without it, almost nothing gets solved at scale. The Case for Growth is our attempt to put that idea back into conservation as part of a serious effort to make life more affordable, more sustainable, and more abundant in the US and far beyond.

ChatGPT turned three years old the other day, which means we've spent three years in an AI frenzy.

It also means hundreds of millions of people have been using ChatGPT for years and … not seeing any ads at all, whether they're using the paid version or the free one.

That's not totally astonishing: We've gotten used to consumer internet products like Google, Facebook, and Instagram taking off without ads for a few years. And then, the deluge.

So how much longer will ChatGPT remain ad-free? And what happens when it isn't?

Over the weekend, we got a hint that an ad push may be underway, via some code from ChatGPT's Android app unearthed by developer Tibor Blaho:

ChatGPT Android app 1.2025.329 beta includes new references to an ""ads feature"" with ""bazaar content"", ""search ad"" and ""search ads carousel"" pic.twitter.com/BdHOJIQHmA

Scouring apps for yet-to-be-released features is a long-standing tech hobby, and sometimes it really does yield results. It's also entirely possible that what Blaho found is … something other than an ad product road map.

But it still seems very, very likely that ChatGPT will have ads at some point.

We know this in part because OpenAI executives, starting with Sam Altman, have suggested they will be coming (in 2024, Altman said ads were gross; this year, he allowed that maybe OpenAI could make ""some cool ad product"").

We know it because OpenAI has been stocking itself with talent from Meta — one of the most successful advertising companies in the world.

We know it because it's simply logical: Altman says ChatGPT has around 800 million weekly users, and only a small percentage of them pay. At some point, his company will want to convert those non-paying users into revenue-generating ones, and ads are the obvious way to do that.

And we know it because on Monday, via an internal memo, OpenAI acknowledged that it was working on ads — but was now delaying that push, while it scrambled to improve its core product in the face of competition from Google. (I've asked OpenAI for comment; while we're here, I'll note that OpenAI has a business partnership with Axel Springer, which owns Business Insider.)

Meanwhile, The Information reports, OpenAI focus groups show that some ChatGPT users already assume ads play a role in the results they're seeing. 

But none of that tells us when ads will actually arrive in ChatGPT. And it certainly doesn't address the core question about what happens when you inject ads into an answer machine: Does that machine give you the best answers? Or the answers someone has paid to give you?

Which brings us to the next question: If ads do show up, what would they look like? Because sticking ads into an AI assistant isn't like putting them next to search results or inside a news feed. There's no feed. There's just the answer.

There are a few obvious possibilities, none of which are mutually exclusive:

• Search-style intent ads

This is the Google model: You tell Google exactly what you're looking for — ""dumpling spot near me,"" ""best Chromebook"" — and advertisers bid to appear next to those queries. If ChatGPT is now a legitimate Google rival, why not use Google's business model, too?

• Personalized ads based on everything ChatGPT knows about you

This is the Meta model: Instead of bidding on queries, advertisers target people, based on what it has learned about their behavior, on and off Meta's properties.

• Old-school text links

The simplest version: ""You asked for the best toaster, here are three recommendations, one of which is sponsored."" That's basically affiliate marketing. It's low-key and probably the least lucrative.

• Multimedia ads

You are probably typing things into ChatGPT and reading its results. But it doesn't have to work like that: ChatGPT can already talk and show you images. Via Sora, it can show you video. The magic device famed designer Jony Ive is building for the service likely won't have any screen at all. All of which means that Altman and Co. may have a choice to serve you ads that aren't tiny boxes of text on your phone.

But no matter what route OpenAI takes, all of its ad plans will have the same peril: the possibility that injecting paid messages in a service you count on could change your relationship with that service, and weaken that trust.

It's a gnarly problem, even for a company that's used to moving quickly and fixing messes after the fact. They might move more slowly on this one than some people think.

Costco is suing the government to recover tariff money.

The wholesale retailer has filed a lawsuit against the United States, the US Customs and Border Protection agency, and Rodney S. Scott, the Commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection.

The suit asks the US Court of International Trade to strike down tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump by executive order under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and to ensure tariff refunds for businesses that paid import duties.

In a complaint submitted Friday, November 28, the retailer said it is seeking a ""full refund"" of duties it paid after Trump used the emergency-powers law to levy what he described as ""reciprocal"" tariffs.

The complaint cited a previous lawsuit, VOS Selections, Inc. vs. Trump, filed against the Trump administration, for which the US Supreme Court heard arguments in early November.

""This separate action is necessary, however, because even if the IEEPA duties and underlying executive orders are held unlawful by the Supreme Court, importers that have paid IEEPA duties, including Plaintiff, are not guaranteed a refund for those unlawfully collected tariffs in the absence of their own judgment and judicial relief,"" the complaint reads.

The complaint highlights a process called liquidation, which is when customs completes its final review and determines the official amount of duty for a particular shipment. Liquidation typically provides Customs and Border Protection with the opportunity to either refund the importer or demand additional duties to be paid. This process must be completed within one year of a shipment's entry unless it is extended at the discretion of the CBP. It is unknown if a refund could happen once liquidation is over.

According to the complaint, tariffs on Costco's imports will begin to be liquidated as early as December 15, and the CBP has already declined the company's request to extend the liquidation.

""Plaintiff seeks relief from the impending liquidations to ensure that its right to a complete refund is not jeopardized,"" the complaint reads.

The Court of International Trade and the District Court for the District of Columbia have both ruled the IEEPA tariffs illegal on separate occasions. Their rulings are mostly based on the Constitution, which says that Congress has the exclusive power to levy taxes and collect duties. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reaffirmed the CTI's decision in August.

The use of the IEEPA for tariffs eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, and the court is currently deliberating.

Costco did not specify the amount of duties it has paid in the complaint. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a filing submitted to SCOTUS in September that the government could end up owing $1 trillion in tariffs should the court rule against the Trump administration.

Earlier this year, Costco's CEO, Ron Vachris, said during a Q2 earnings call, ""About a third of our sales in the US are imported from other countries, and less than half of those are items coming from China, Mexico, and Canada."" This was before Trump's April 2 ""Liberation Day"" tariffs.

Costco, the White House, and the US Customs and Border Protection agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The booming American drone market is having a moment.

From niche gadgets to strategic infrastructure, the growing industry is getting another boost from the Trump administration's supercharged defense spending and the military's growing interest in heavily investing in drones.

The resulting boom isn't just benefiting the legacy players.

Early-stage drone startups are suddenly winning contracts once typically reserved for more established defense companies, a frenzy that has turned 2025 into a breakout year for drones across both defense and commercial markets.

Defense-focused drone startups are motivated to work on the tech and ""make sure the West wins in the emerging era of unmanned wars,"" Ethan Thornton, CEO and founder of Mach Industries, said in an email to Business Insider. His startup recently won a US Army contract for its cruise missiles.

This is the first installment in a three-part series on the major players in the drone industry. If you have a drone-related or defense tech tip, contact this reporter by email at jhornstein@insider.com or securely on Signal at juliah.22.

In this article

Amazon has found a way to let cloud clients extensively customize generative AI models. The catch is that the system costs $100,000 per year.

The Nova Forge offering from Amazon Web Services gives organizations access to Amazon's AI models in various stages of training so they can incorporate their own data earlier in the process. 

Already, companies can fine-tune large language models after they've been trained. The results with Nova Forge will lean more heavily on the data that customers supply. Nova Forge customers will also have the option to refine open-weight models, but training data and computing infrastructure are not included. 

Organizations that assemble their own models might end up spending hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, which means using Nova Forge is more affordable, Amazon said.

AWS released its own models under the Nova brand in 2024, but they aren't the first choice for most software developers. A July survey from Menlo Ventures said that by the middle of this year, Amazon-backed Anthropic controlled 32% of the market for enterprise LLMs, followed by OpenAI with 25%, Google with 20% and Meta with 9% — Amazon Nova had a less than 5% share, a Menlo spokesperson said.

The Nova models are available through AWS' Bedrock service for running models on Amazon cloud infrastructure, as are Anthropic's Claude 4.5 models.

""We are a frontier lab that has focused on customers,"" Rohit Prasad, Amazon head scientist for artificial general intelligence, told CNBC in an interview. ""Our customers wanted it. We have invented on their behalf to make this happen.""

Nova Forge is also in use by internal Amazon customers, including teams that work on the company's stores and the Alexa AI assistant, Prasad said. 

Reddit needed an AI model for moderating content that would be sophisticated about the many subjects people discuss on the social network. Engineers found that a Nova model enhanced with Reddit data through Forge performed better than commercially available large-scale models, Prasad said. Booking.com, Nimbus Therapeutics, the Nomura Research Institute and Sony are also building models with Forge, Amazon said.

Organizations can request that Amazon engineers help them build their Forge models, but that assistance is not included in the new service's $100,000 annual fee.

AWS is also introducing new models for developers at its Reinvent conference in Las Vegas this week.

Nova 2 Pro is a reasoning model whose tests show it performs at least as well as Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5, OpenAI's GPT-5 and GPT-5.1, and Google's Gemini 3.0 Pro Preview, Amazon said. Reasoning involves running a series of computations that might take extra time in response to requests to produce better answers. Nova 2 Pro will be available in early access to AWS customers with Forge subscriptions, Prasad said. That means Forge customers and Amazon engineers will be able to try Nova 2 Pro at the same time. 

Nova 2 Omni is another reasoning model that can process incoming images, speech, text and videos, and it generates images and text. It's the first reasoning model with that range of capability, Amazon said. Amazon hopes that, by delivering a multifaceted model, it can lower the cost and complexity of incorporating AI models into applications.

Tens of thousands of organizations are using Nova models each week, Prasad said. AWS has said it has millions of customers. Nova is the second-most popular family of models in Bedrock, Prasad said. The top group of models are from Anthropic.

In this article

Amazon's cloud unit on Tuesday announced AI-enabled software designed to help clients better understand and recover from outages. 

DevOps Agent, as the artificial intelligence tool from Amazon Web Services is called, predicts the cause of technical hiccups using input from third-party tools such as Datadog and Dynatrace. AWS said customers can sign up to use the tool Tuesday in a preview, before Amazon starts charging for the service.

The AI outage tool from AWS is intended to help companies more quickly figure out what caused an outage and implement fixes, Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of agentic AI at AWS, told CNBC. It's what site reliability engineers, or SREs, do at many companies that provide online services. 

SREs try to prevent downtime and jump into action during live incidents. Startups such as Resolve and Traversal have started marketing AI assistants for these experts. Microsoft's Azure cloud group introduced an SRE Agent in May.

Rather than waiting for on-call staff members to figure out what happened, the AWS DevOps Agent automatically assigns work to agents that look into different hypotheses, Sivasubramanian said.

""By the time the on-call ops team member dials in, they have an incident report with preliminary investigation of what could be the likely outcome, and then suggest what could be the remediation as well,"" Sivasubramanian told CNBC ahead of AWS' Reinvent conference in Las Vegas this week.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia has tested the AWS DevOps Agent. In under 15 minutes, the software found the root cause of an issue that would have taken a veteran engineer hours, AWS said in a statement.

The tool relies on Amazon's in-house AI models and those from other providers, a spokesperson said.

AWS has been selling software in addition to raw infrastructure for many years. Amazon was early to start renting out server space and storage to developers since the mid-2000s, and technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Oracle have followed.

Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, these cloud infrastructure providers have been trying to demonstrate how generative AI models, which are often training in large cloud computing data centers, can speed up work for software developers.

Over the summer, Amazon announced Kiro, a so-called vibe coding tool that produces and modifies source code based on user text prompts. In November, Google debuted similar software for individual software developers called Antigravity, and Microsoft sells subscriptions to GitHub Copilot.

Zafran Security, a cybersecurity startup created by an Iranian-born spy whose story helped inspire the hit Apple TV series ""Tehran,"" has raised $60 million, the company said Tuesday.

Sanaz Yashar, the former spy and CEO of Zafran, told CNBC that the funding round comes as a result of the accelerating speed and pace of cyberattacks due to the on-going AI boom. Zafran uses artificial intelligence and automation technology to manage threat exposure.

It's ""becoming much more severe than it was even a year ago,"" she said in an exclusive interview. 

The round brings Zafran's total funding to $130 million since its founding in 2022. Zafran did not disclose the valuation at which it raised, but the startup said it has more than tripled annual recurring revenue since its last round for $70 million in September 2024. Annual recurring revenue is a term often used to measure income expected on a 12-month basis for a product. 

The company plans to use the money to hire more people, Yashar said.

Menlo Ventures led the funding round, with participation from Sequoia Capital and Cyberstarts, which was an early investor in the startup Wiz that sold to Google for $32 billion in March. 

Companies are looking for ways to reinvigorate their cybersecurity capabilities as AI reshapes the sophistication and capabilities of cyber criminals. 

Besides Wiz, Palo Alto Networks in July announced that it acquired identity security provider CyberArk for $25 billion. 

Yashar and co-founders Ben Seri and Snir Havdala created Zafran following an investigation into a ransomware attack on a hospital in Israel. 

""The data was there,"" Yashar told CNBC, adding that cohesive security tools might have prevented the attack. ""If the security tools were talking to each other, they could block it.""

Yashar, who moved to Israel from Tehran at 17, served for 15 years in an elite cybersecurity intelligence unit within the Israel Defense Forces known as Unit 8200. She also led major investigations at threat detection firm FireEye and Mandiant, which Google bought in 2022. 

Many famous cybersecurity companies have originated from Unit 8200 alum, including Palo Alto Networks, Check Point Software and CyberArk. 

Zafran customers include healthcare, financial services, insurance, technology and Fortune 500 companies, Yashar said.

In this article

Michael and Susan Dell announced Tuesday that they have committed $6.25 billion to fund investment accounts for some 25 million American children. 

The couple's donation will be the largest ever devoted to American children, according to Invest America, a nonprofit advocacy group partnered with the Dells.

""It's designed to help families feel supported from the start and encourage them to keep saving as their children grow,"" Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, told CNBC in an interview. ""We know that when children have accounts like this, they're much more likely to graduate from high school, from college, buy a home, start a business and less likely to be incarcerated.""

The Dells' commitment goes hand in hand with a new federal government program that allows parents to open tax-advantaged investment accounts for children under 18 with Social Security numbers. Under the federal program, U.S. citizens born from the beginning of 2025 through 2028 will receive a federal grant of $1,000 to seed those so-called Trump accounts. Parents will be able to open and contribute to these accounts starting on July 4, 2026, with IRS guidance yet to be issued.

The Dells have committed to seed Trump accounts with $250 for children who are 10 or under who were born before Jan. 1, 2025. According to Invest America, the pledged funds will cover 25 million children age 10 and under in ZIP codes with a median income of $150,000 or less. 

""We want to help the children that weren't part of the government program,"" Dell said.

Dell said he first became interested in seeding investment accounts for children after hearing the idea from hedge fund manager Brad Gerstner around 2021. Gerstner, CEO of Altimeter Capital, later founded Invest America, which advocated for the program to get included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Trump Accounts can only be used to invest in low-cost diversified funds that track a U.S. stock index. Gerstner said these accounts and grants give American children the chance to benefit from U.S. stock market growth at an early age.

Gerstner said it will take more than the $250 from the Dells or $1,000 federal grants for the accounts to compound to a substantial sum. However, Gerstner said the seed money encourages parents to add their own funds. 

He added that the legislation makes it far easier for corporations and philanthropists to make charitable contributions on a large scale. Dell Technologies has pledged to match the $1,000 grants by the U.S. Treasury deposited into accounts for new children of employees.

Parents only have to open a Trump account to automatically receive a grant from the Dells.

""It would have been impractical, or maybe even impossible, to impact this many kids in this way without such a program,"" Dell said.

There are few precedents for the Dells' pledge. The foundation of shoe billionaire Harold Alfond, who died in 2007, issues $500 educational grants toward every child born in Maine.

While Trump accounts are easy to seed, they lack some of the tax advantages of other accounts such as 529 accounts or Roth IRAs. Withdrawals are not allowed until the child turns 18, at which point the assets are rolled into an IRA and withdrawals are taxed.

Dell said he has spoken to other major philanthropists and is optimistic that others will also pledge funds to these investment accounts.

""What we hope is that every child sees a future worth saving for it,"" he said. ""You think about the compounding effect of a program like this in 10, 20, 30 years on millions of children. That's what gets us excited.""

Correction: This story has been updated to clarify where the money will come from when parents open a Trump account.

In this article

A YouTube tool that uses creators' biometrics to help them remove AI-generated videos that exploit their likeness also allows Google to train its artificial intelligence models on that sensitive data, experts told CNBC.

In response to concern from intellectual property experts, YouTube told CNBC that Google has never used creators' biometric data to train AI models and it is reviewing the language used in the tool's sign-up form to avoid confusion. But YouTube told CNBC it will not be changing its underlying policy. 

The discrepancy highlights a broader divide inside Alphabet, where Google is aggressively expanding its AI efforts while YouTube works to maintain trust with creators and rights holders who depend on the platform for their businesses.

YouTube is expanding its ""likeness detection,"" a tool the company introduced in October that flags when a creator's face is used without their permission in deepfakes, the term used to describe fake videos created using AI. The feature is being expanded to millions of creators in the YouTube Partner Program as AI-manipulated content becomes more prevalent throughout social media.

The tool scans videos uploaded across YouTube to identify where a creator's face may have been altered or generated by artificial intelligence. Creators can then decide whether to request the video's removal, but to use the tool, YouTube requires that creators upload a government ID and a biometric video of their face. Biometrics are the measurement of physical characteristics to verify a person's identity.

Experts say that by tying the tool to Google's privacy policy, YouTube has left the door open for future misuse of creators' biometrics. The policy states that public content, including biometric information, can be used ""to help train Google's AI models and build products and features.""

""Likeness detection is a completely optional feature, but does require a visual reference to work,"" YouTube spokesperson Jack Malon said in a statement to CNBC. ""Our approach to that data is not changing. As our Help Center has stated since the launch, the data provided for the likeness detection tool is only used for identity verification purposes and to power this specific safety feature.""

YouTube told CNBC it is ""considering ways to make the in-product language clearer."" The company has not said what specific changes to the wording will be made or when they will take effect. 

Experts remain cautious, saying they raised concerns about the policy to YouTube months ago.

""As Google races to compete in AI and training data becomes strategic gold, creators need to think carefully about whether they want their face controlled by a platform rather than owned by themselves,"" said Dan Neely, CEO of Vermillio, which helps individuals protect their likeness from being misused and also facilitates secure licensing of authorized content. ""Your likeness will be one of the most valuable assets in the AI era, and once you give that control away, you may never get it back.""

Vermillio and Loti are third-party companies working with creators, celebrities and media companies to monitor and enforce likeness rights across the internet. With advancements in AI video generation, their usefulness has ramped up for IP rights holders.

Loti CEO Luke Arrigoni said the risks of YouTube's current biometric policy ""are enormous.""  

""Because the release currently allows someone to be able to attach that name to the actual biometrics of the face, they could create something more synthetic that looks like that person,"" Arrigoni said.

Neely and Arrigoni both said they would not currently recommend that any of their clients sign up for likeness detection on YouTube.

YouTube's head of creator product, Amjad Hanif, said YouTube built its likeness detection tool to operate ""at the scale of YouTube,"" where hundreds of hours of new footage are posted every minute. The tool is set to be made available to the more than 3 million creators in the YouTube Partner Program by the end of January, Hanif said. 

""We do well when creators do well,"" Hanif told CNBC. ""We're here as stewards and supporters of the creator ecosystem, and so we are investing in tools to support them on that journey.""

The rollout comes as AI-generated video tools rapidly improve in quality and accessibility, raising new concerns for creators whose likeness and voice are central to their business.

YouTube creator Mikhail Varshavski, a physician who goes by Doctor Mike on the video platform, said he uses the service's likeness detection tool to review dozens of AI-manipulated videos a week.

Varshavski has been on YouTube for nearly a decade and has amassed more than 14 million subscribers on the platform. He makes videos reacting to TV medical dramas, answering questions on health fads and debunking myths. He relies on his credibility as a board-certified physician to inform his viewers.

Rapid advances in AI have made it easier for bad actors to copy his face and voice in deepfake videos that could give his viewers misleading medical advice, Varshavski said. 

He first encountered a deepfake of himself on TikTok, where an AI-generated doppelgänger promoted a ""miracle"" supplement.

""It obviously freaked me out, because I've spent over a decade investing in garnering the audience's trust and telling them the truth and helping them make good health-care decisions,"" he said. ""To see someone use my likeness in order to trick someone into buying something they don't need or that can potentially hurt them, scared everything about me in that situation.""

AI video generation tools like Google's Veo 3 and OpenAI's Sora have made it significantly easier to create deepfakes of celebrities and creators like Varshavski. That's because their likeness is frequently featured in the datasets used by tech companies to train their AI models. 

Veo 3 is trained on a subset of the more than 20 billion videos uploaded to YouTube, CNBC reported in July. That could include several hundred hours of video from Varshavski.

Deepfakes have ""become more widespread and proliferative,"" Varshavski said. ""I've seen full-on channels created weaponizing these types of AI deep fakes, whether it was for tricking people to buy a product or strictly to bully someone.""

At the moment, creators have no way to monetize unauthorized use of their likeness, unlike the revenue-sharing options available through YouTube's Content ID system for copyrighted material, which is typically used by companies that hold large copyright catalogs. YouTube's Hanif said the company is exploring how a similar model could work for AI-generated likeness use in the future.

Earlier this year, YouTube gave creators the option to permit third-party AI companies to train on their videos. Hanif said that millions of creators have opted into that program, with no promise of compensation.

Hanif said his team is still working to improve the accuracy of the product but early testing has been successful, though he did not provide accuracy metrics.

As for takedown activity across the platform, Hanif said that remains low largely because many creators choose not to delete flagged videos.

""They'll be happy to know that it's there, but not really feel like it merits taking down,"" Hanif said. ""By and far the most common action is to say, 'I've looked at it, but I'm OK with it.'""

Agents and rights advocates told CNBC that low takedown numbers are more likely due to confusion and lack of awareness rather than comfort with AI content.

Sam Altman is feeling the pressure.

The OpenAI CEO sent a memo to his staffers on Monday outlining a ""code red"" effort to improve its chatbot ChatGPT, according to multiple reports. Altman said OpenAI will be pulling back on investments in areas like health, shopping and advertising as it works to prioritize ChatGPT, the reports said.

OpenAI declined to comment on Tuesday.

""Our focus now is to keep making ChatGPT more capable, continue growing, and expand access around the world — while making it feel even more intuitive and personal,"" Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT at OpenAI, wrote in a post Monday on X.

The Information was first to report on the memo.

More than 800 million people use ChatGPT each week, but the company is facing increasingly stiff competition from rivals like Google and Anthropic.

Google announced its latest artificial intelligence model, Gemini 3, last month, which topped industry benchmarks and was widely lauded by users, researchers and developers across social media.

The company said its Gemini app has 650 million monthly active users while AI Overviews, which appear at the top of search results, have 2 billion monthly users.

Altman congratulated Google on the launch, writing in a post on X last month that Gemini 3 ""looks like a great model.""

Anthropic, meanwhile, has shown strong momentum with enterprises.

As of September, the startup said it has more than 300,000 business customers, up from less than 1,000 just two years ago. Large accounts, which Anthropic defines as customers that each represent more than $100,000 in run-rate revenue, grew more than seven times in the past year, the company said.

OpenAI launched as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but has quickly become one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet following the launch of ChatGPT three years ago. 

The company's valuation has swelled to $500 billion as it's worked to deploy its technology around the globe. 

In recent months, OpenAI has made more $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments in a deal-making blitz. The staggering sum has raised eyebrows and prompted questions about how the company will be able to afford those commitments. 

Altman has repeatedly brushed off concerns. 

Last month, OpenAI said it is on track to reach more than $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate this year, with plans to grow to hundreds of billions in sales by 2030. 

In a lengthy post on X in November, Altman said large infrastructure projects take time to build, which is why the company needed to start now. 

""This is the bet we are making, and given our vantage point, we feel good about it,"" Altman wrote. 

Weeks later, Altman seems to be feeling the heat.

In this article

MongoDB shares ripped 25% higher on Tuesday after the company blew past Wall Street's third-quarter expectations and lifted its forecast as its cloud database platform gained traction with customers. 

The database software provider posted adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share on $628 million in revenue. That topped the 80 cents adjusted per share and $592 million in revenue expected by analysts polled by LSEG. Revenues grew 19% from last year.

MongoDB said its Atlas platform grew 30% from a year ago and accounted for 75% of total revenues for the quarter. The company said it ended the period with more than 60,800 Atlas customers, with revenues  expected to grow 27% for the platform in the current period.

""Q3 was an exceptional quarter that was driven by our continued go-to-market execution and the broad-based demand we are seeing across business,"" said CEO Chirantan ""CJ"" Desai in his first earnings call at the helm of the company. 

Dev Ittycheria, who ran the company for 11 years and took it public, stepped down in November.

Desai believes the company is approaching a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity as artificial intelligence, cloud and data trends reach a ""true inflection point."" He told investors he plans to focus on building customer relationships and innovation in the coming months. 

Citing those tailwinds, MongoDB boosted its guidance for the full year on Atlas growth and tailwinds from ongoing artificial intelligence demand. The company now anticipates revenues between $2.434 billion and $2.439 billion, up from prior guidance of $2.34 billion and $2.36 billion. 

Analysts at Bernstein lifted their price target on shares to $452, expecting the stock to continue benefiting from accelerating growth as other software companies struggle. 

 ""We expect strong consumption demand, potential upside from AI, and benefits from an easing interest rate environment to continue driving re-rating upside in the near term,"" they wrote. 

Shares have popped more than 40% this year.

Nvidia-backed video generation startup Luma AI is joining a growing wave of U.S. tech companies launching operations in the U.K., with major plans for a London expansion revealed on Tuesday.

The Palo Alto-headquartered startup will look to hire around 200 employees — making up around 40% of its workforce — at its new London base by early 2027, across research, engineering, partnerships and strategic development. 

The expansion comes two weeks on from Luma announcing a $900 million funding round led by Saudi Public Investment Fund-owned AI company Humain, which saw it hit a valuation upwards of $4 billion. The startup previously received backing from Nvidia. 

Luma is building ""world models,"" a class of AI models that are able to learn from video, audio and images, alongside text, and which large language models (LLMs) like those powering OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini use. 

The startup is currently targeting marketing, advertising, media and entertainment sectors with its video models, which it sells via an application programming interface (API) and as part of a content creation suite.

""With this Series C raise and the upcoming build-out of global compute infrastructure, we have the capital and capacity to bring world-scale AI to creatives everywhere,"" said Amit Jain, CEO and co-founder of Luma AI. ""Launching across Europe and the Middle East is the logical next step in putting this power directly in the hands of storytellers, agencies and brands globally.""

The U.K. is the starting point of the expansion because of its access to talent, Jain told CNBC.

""London has some of the best people when it comes to research, given the universities here and institutions like DeepMind,"" he said. ""We also consider London to be the entry point to the European market.""

Luma is the latest in a wave of North American AI labs doubling down on the U.K. and Europe as they look to take advantage of talent pools and revenue opportunities.

In November, San Francisco-based Anthropic announced plans to open offices in Paris and Munich, months on from kicking off a hiring spree in London and Dublin. Canadian AI startup Cohere said it would open a Paris office to become its EMEA headquarters in September and OpenAI announced a new office in Munich in February.

While world models may not yet be as developed as LLMs, some researchers say they are as, if not more, crucial in the pursuit of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

""These kinds of visual models are about a year to a year-and-a-half behind language models right now,"" said Jain. 

But world models will become the ""natural interface"" for AI for most day-to-day use in time, he predicted, pointing to the amount of time people spend watching video content each day. 

Tech giants including Google, Meta and Nvidia are all developing world models for a range of use cases.

Luma released its latest model, Ray3, in September, which Jain told CNBC benchmarks higher than OpenAI's Sora and at similar levels to Google's Veo 3.

A slew of new supply is still making its way through the multifamily housing market. That, coupled with weakening demand, especially from the youngest workers, is pushing vacancies up and rents down. 

The national median rent for apartments fell 1% in November from October, and now stands at $1,367, according to Apartment List. It was the fourth consecutive month-over-month decline. Apartment rents are down 1.1% from November 2024 and have fallen 5.2% from their 2022 peak. 

""Earlier this year, it appeared that annual growth was on track to flip positive for the first time since mid-2023; however, that rebound stalled out and reversed course during a particularly slow summer,"" according to Apartment List researchers.

After hitting a record high for this index, which dates back to 2017, in October, the national multifamily vacancy rate remained at 7.2% in November. 

The historic surge in multifamily construction over the past few years is now pulling back, but a good supply of new units is still coming online at a time of much weaker demand. 

The fall historically sees the biggest slowdown in multifamily rents, but this year it's even more pronounced. CoStar reported the biggest monthly drops in median rent it had seen in 15 years of tracking. The primary reason is that more young people are struggling to form new households.  

""That 18- to 34-year-old group … I think it's up to 32.5% of those now are living with family, and that's the highest it's been in a while,"" said Grant Montgomery, CoStar's national director of multifamily analytics. ""I think it reflects high rental costs that have risen over the years, as well as the tougher job market for young folks just coming out of college."" 

""That is where a lot of demand traditionally comes from, the core renter demand is from that sort of younger base,"" he said.

The weakness is showing up in stocks of the major public apartment REITs. Names like AvalonBay, Equity Residential and Camden Property Trust are all down year to date. 

Some markets are seeing rents drop faster than others, due to local economic factors. Las Vegas, for example, is experiencing slower tourism, which in turn hits jobs there. Boston has seen a decline in federal funding for biotech as well as a drop in foreign students for its colleges and universities; both are impacting its rental sector hard. Austin, Texas, is seeing the biggest hit to rents, thanks to still more construction of multifamily units. 

While rents are softening nationally, and landlords are boosting concessions, renters are increasingly searching in more affordable markets. 

Cincinnati was the market most searched for, followed by Atlanta and Kansas City, Missouri, according to a Yardi report that looked at where apartment hunters were active last summer, the traditionally busiest time for new leasing. St. Louis saw the biggest quarterly jump in tenant interest, and Washington, D.C., dropped from the top spot to No. 4. 

""The Midwest, in particular, drew more attention than ever, signaling that many of its 'hidden gem' markets are no longer a secret,"" according to the report, which found 11 of the top 30 cities for renter demand were in the Midwest.

Yardi also revised its expectations for 2026 supply, saying that while new supply will decline through 2027, a larger-than-expected under-construction pipeline caused it to increase its previous quarterly estimates for 2025 and 2026 by 6.8% and 2.5%, respectively.

As construction continues to slow into next year, the overall market should stabilize somewhat, according to the Apartment List report.

""That said, the supply boom still has a bit of runway remaining, and the demand outlook has begun to appear weaker amid a shaky labor market,"" researchers wrote.

In this article

SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son on Monday downplayed the decision to offload the conglomerate's entire Nvidia stake, saying he ""was crying"" over parting with the shares. 

Speaking at a forum in Tokyo Monday, Son addressed SoftBank's November disclosure that the firm had sold its holding in the American chip darling for $5.83 billion. 

According to Son, SoftBank wouldn't have made the move if it didn't need to bankroll its next artificial intelligence investments, including a big bet on OpenAI and data center projects. 

""I don't want to sell a single share. I just had more need for money to invest in OpenAI and other projects, Son said during the FII Priority Asia forum. ""I was crying to sell Nvidia shares.""

Son's comments are consistent with what analysts and other Softbank executives said in November, describing the sale as part of broader efforts to bolster SoftBank Vision Fund's AI war chest. 

SoftBank has doubled down on its AI plans this year with a series of projects, including work on Stargate Project data centers and the acquisition of U.S. chip designer Ampere Computing.

The Japanese giant could also ""potentially"" increase its investment in OpenAI depending on the performance of the ChatGPT maker and the valuation of further rounds, a person familiar with the matter previously told CNBC.

Earlier this year, Son said that SoftBank was ""all in"" on OpenAI and predicted the AI startup would one day become the most valuable company in the world. 

So far, that bet has reaped some dividends, with SoftBank reporting last month that its second-quarter net profit more than doubled to 2.5 trillion yen ($16.6 billion), driven by valuation gains in its OpenAI holdings.

However, SoftBank's massive AI bets come amid growing fears and jitters in markets about a potential AI bubble. 

In his Monday talk, Son also pushed back against these concerns, arguing that those who talk about an AI bubble are ""not smart enough.""

He predicted that ""super [artificial] intelligence"" and AI robots will generate at least 10% of global gross domestic product over the long term, which he said would outweigh trillions of dollars of investment into the technology.

President Donald Trump is holding a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Tuesday, as his administration grapples with a slew of major political issues that have come to the fore since the top officials last convened less than eight weeks earlier.

The meeting comes as bipartisan scrutiny ramps up over the administration's decision to fire multiple missile strikes on an alleged Venezuelan drug-running boat in early September. 

The White House said Monday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authorized Adm. Frank Bradley to order a second strike on the boat, which reportedly killed survivors of the initial attack.

Some experts and lawmakers have said the ""double-tap"" strike could constitute a war crime. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican, vowed on Monday to conduct oversight on the military action. The White House maintains the strikes were legal and conducted ""in self defense.""

The last Cabinet meeting was held on Oct. 9, in the middle of what became the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. 

The shutdown, which ended on Nov. 12 after 43 days, centered on a dispute over enhanced Affordable Care Act health-insurance subsidies, which are set to expire by the end of the year. The logjam broke after enough Democrats backed a funding deal that included a guarantee from the Senate's GOP majority to allow a vote in December on a bill of Democrats' choosing.

Numerous polls showed more Americans blamed Republicans for the shutdown, which overlapped with a string of blowout victories for Democrats in key elections in early November. The sweeping GOP rout set off alarm bells within Trump's party, which hopes to keep its slim congressional majorities after next year's midterms. 

The shifting dynamics have drawn focus to Tuesday's special election for a congressional seat in a deep-red Tennessee district, which appears to have grown competitive despite backing Trump by 22 points in 2024.

Days after the partisan shutdown fight ended, Congress surprisingly came together to back a bill ordering the Department of Justice to release its files on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Trump, a former friend of Epstein's who had fumed about the growing push to disclose the government's records on the deceased financier, ultimately told Republicans to vote for the bill. He signed it Nov. 19, starting a 30-day timer for Attorney General Pam Bondi to publicly release unclassified files relating to Epstein and his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's apparent openness to a U.S.-brokered peace plan with Russia is raising hope that an end to the yearslong land war in Europe could be coming into view. 

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner were seen on Tuesday morning in Moscow, where they were expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Artificial intelligence startup Mistral released a new suite of models Tuesday as it looks to keep pace with leading AI labs Google, OpenAI and DeepSeek. 

The French company's announcement follows on from model releases from the likes of DeepSeek and Google in recent weeks, as AI labs across the globe scramble to remain at the frontier of research while also building out commercial operations. 

Mistral's release includes a large model which it claims is the ""world's best open-weight multimodal and multilingual."" It also announced the release of a small model the company says can be used in robotics, devices and drones.

Founded in 2023, Mistral has emerged as one of Europe's leading AI companies and raised a 1.7 billion euro funding round in September. Dutch chip equipment maker ASML contributed 1.3 billion euros of the raise, with Nvidia also participating. 

The round saw the startup — which was previously backed by Microsoft and Andreessen Horowitz — hit an 11.7 billion euro valuation.

""Mistral 3 sets a new standard for the global availability of AI and unlocks new possibilities for enterprises,"" the company said in a statement. 

""This spectrum of models further extends our customers' applied AI capabilities to robotics, autonomous drones, and small on-device applications without network access, as well as the world's largest enterprise agentic workflows.""

Mistral's new large model offers powerful agentic capabilities and is engineered for AI assistants, retrieval-augmented systems, scientific workloads and complex enterprise workflows, the company said. 

The startup's new small model, dubbed Ministral 3, is small enough to run in drones, cars, robots, phones and laptops.

""Small models deliver advantages for most real-world applications: lower inference cost, reduced latency, and domain-specific performance,"" Mistral said. ""They can be customized to outperform larger models on specific workflows and reach state-of-the-art performance for their size.""

Ministral 3 can be deployed on a single graphics processing unit (GPU), which the company said reduced running costs and sped up iteration. 

""The next chapter of AI isn't just bigger — it's smarter, faster, and open,"" the company said. ""Together, we're building towards an era of distributed intelligence.""

The latest releases come as Mistral looks to ramp up commercial activity in a bid to justify its nearly 12 billion euro price tag.

Alongside a deal with HSBC to give the multinational bank access to its models for tasks ranging from financial analysis to translation, announced on Monday, Mistral has inked contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars with several corporates. 

The startup is also increasingly looking to M&A as it accelerates growth. While considered a leading homegrown player in the AI space in Europe, Mistral's war chest pales in comparison to a cohort of U.S. rivals that are increasingly setting up shop on the continent. 

Anthropic, which announced a $13 billion raise at a $183 billion valuation in September, and OpenAI, which reportedly sold secondary shares at a $500 billion price tag in October, have both announced new offices in Europe in 2025.

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published 10 Stocks Already Hurting in December. American Bitcoin Corp (NASDAQ:ABTC) is one of the top performers on Monday.

American Bitcoin Corp (NASDAQ:ABTC) fell by 15.57 percent on Monday to finish at $3.58 apiece as investors took path from its major asset's decline on the same day.

On Monday alone, Bitcoin shed 0.058 percent to hover around the $86,000 level. Its current value marked a 21.6 percent fall from the $110,000 territory in just the past 30 trading days.

In other recent news, American Bitcoin Corp (NASDAQ:ABTC) swung to a net profit of $3.47 million from a $576 million net loss in the same period last year. Revenues soared by 453 percent to $64.22 million from only $11.61 million year-on-year.

“The third quarter validated the thesis behind American Bitcoin,” said American Bitcoin Corp (NASDAQ:ABTC) Chief Strategy Officer and co-founder Eric Trump.

“While others paid spot, we generated Bitcoin below market through scalable, asset-light mining operations. Coupled with disciplined at-market purchases, we added more than 3,000 Bitcoin to our reserve. This dual strategy is how we intend to compound value for our shareholders and solidify our position as a capital-efficient platform for long-term Bitcoin accumulation,” he noted.

American Bitcoin Corp. (NASDAQ:ABTC) is a Bitcoin accumulation platform and is majority owned by listed firm Hut 8 Corp.

The Trump family has lost roughly a billion dollars, according to estimates.

President Donald Trump and his family have boasted of going ""all in"" on cryptocurrencies -- but a recent downturn in bitcoin has pummeled digital asset investors, including the Trumps, who by one estimate have had roughly a billion dollars of their net worth erased in just a matter of weeks.

Bitcoin dropped as much as 8% in trading on Monday, at one point falling below $85,000 -- shedding 30% from its all-time high in early October, when bitcoin was trading at more than $125,000.

Analysts at Deutsche Bank said last week that $1 trillion in value has been wiped out of the crypto market globally since early October. The analysts said traders dumped riskier assets in the crypto sector amid questions about the strength of the economy and stalled momentum on digital asset regulation.

The crypto sell-off is a stark reminder to investors about how volatile assets can drop in value just as quickly as they go up. 

The Trump family has launched a soup-to-nuts crypto empire over the past year, including a meme coin, a bitcoin mining firm, and a digital asset company called World Liberty Financial that has issued multiple tokens.

Fueled by the Trump administration's abandonment of several high-profile regulatory challenges to the industry, the price of bitcoin and other digital assets soared in the months following Trump's inauguration, bolstering the Trump family's net worth by hundreds of millions of dollars, according to an ABC News analysis.

But their fortunes have shifted, for now, beneath the weight of a market-wide downturn.

Shares of Trump Media and Technology, the family's media firm that has recently waded deeper into the crypto space, tumbled 5% on Monday. The stock is down about 70% since President Trump's inauguration earlier this year.

The $TRUMP meme coin is now trading near an all-time low of $5.73, according to crypto trading platform CoinMarketCap. The digital token peaked at about $45 just ahead of inauguration. That's a loss of nearly 90% since the start of the year.

And World Liberty's digital governance token is down about 50% since its September launch.

All told, the Trump's family fortune has dropped by about $1 billion -- from $7.7 billion to $6.7 billion -- since early September, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires' Index.

The family, however, appears undeterred. Eric Trump, the president's son, has been touting his crypto companies on social media and in emails to supporters.

He told Bloomberg the bitcoin dip is nothing more than a ""great buying opportunity.""

Ethereum developers are refining a zero-knowledge protocol designed to bring stronger privacy guarantees to on-chain interactions, starting with a “Secret Santa”-style matching system that could evolve into a broader toolkit for private coordination.

Solidity engineer Artem Chystiakov resurfaced the research on Monday in an Ethereum community forum post, pointing to work he first published in January on arXiv.

The idea aims to recreate the anonymous gift-exchange game on Ethereum, where participants are randomly matched without anyone learning who is sending to whom. Doing that on a transparent blockchain, however, requires solving several long-standing issues around randomness, privacy and Sybil-resistance.

Chystiakov said the core problems are straightforward: “Everything on Ethereum is visible to everyone,” blockchains do not provide true randomness, and the system must prevent users from registering multiple times or assigning gifts to themselves.

The proposed protocol uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify sender–receiver relationships without revealing identities, and a transaction relayer to submit moves so individual wallets cannot be linked to actions.

In the proof-of-concept, participants register their Ethereum addresses in a smart contract and commit to a unique digital signature, which blocks duplicate entries. Each participant then submits a random number to a shared list through the relayer.

Because the relayer broadcasts the transactions, no one can tell which address contributed which number. Receivers encrypt their delivery details using these shared numbers, ensuring only their assigned counterpart can decrypt them.

A participant then selects someone else's random number, completing the matching. At that point, the protocol reveals the receiver's identity only to the person assigned as their “Santa,” keeping the rest of the network blind to the pairing.

The work slots into a broader push to design privacy frameworks for Ethereum as crypto systems increasingly intersect with regulated finance.

Zero-knowledge layers of this type can be adapted to anonymous voting, DAO governance, whistleblower channels where employees must prove membership without exposing themselves, and private airdrops or token distributions that avoid revealing who received what.

Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade Overview

The Fusaka Upgrade is Ethereum's next major network upgrade scheduled to take place on December 3, 2025. The upgrade aims to improve network scalability and reduce costs for Layer 2 networks.

Key Points:



• Fusaka launches on December 3, 2025 at slot 13,164,544, marking Ethereum's second major hard fork of 2025 after Pectra.

• PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling) allows validators to verify blockchain data by sampling small random portions instead of downloading everything — reducing bandwidth requirements by up to 85%.

• Layer 2 transaction costs are expected to drop 40-60% as rollups like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base benefit from increased data availability space.

• Block gas limit increases to 60 million (from approximately 36 million), allowing more transactions to be processed directly on Ethereum's main network.

The Fusaka upgrade is a comprehensive network update (or ""hard fork""— a change that isn't backward compatible) scheduled to activate on Ethereum's mainnet on December 3, 2025. This would mark Ethereum's latest upgrade since the Pectra Upgrade which took place in May 2025.

Fusaka's Name

Following Ethereum's naming convention, ""Fusaka"" combines two upgrade names: ""Fulu"" (for the consensus layer, named after a star) and ""Osaka"" (for the execution layer, named after the Japanese city that will host Devcon 2025, an Ethereum convention event). 

To understand Fusaka's importance, it helps to see where it sits in Ethereum's evolution:

The Merge (2022): Transitioned Ethereum from energy-intensive proof-of-work to efficient proof-of-stake

Shanghai/Shapella (2023): Enabled validators to withdraw their staked ETH

Dencun (March 2024): Introduced ""blobs"" (temporary data storage packets) that reduced Layer 2 fees by 90-95%.

Pectra (May 2025): Increased blob capacity and improved validator flexibility.

Fusaka (December 2025): Dramatically scales data availability through PeerDAS and prepares Ethereum for 100,000+ TPS.

Each upgrade builds on the previous one. Dencun introduced the concept of blobs — think of them as temporary storage containers where Layer 2 networks can post transaction data cheaply. Fusaka takes this concept much further by introducing a smarter way for the network to verify this data exists without every validator needing to download everything.

Fusaka includes approximately 12-13 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs — formal proposals for changes to Ethereum). While that sounds technical, the key improvements fall into a few understandable categories.

PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling, defined in EIP-7594) is Fusaka's headline feature and represents a fundamental shift in how Ethereum handles data.

The Problem It Solves: Currently, when Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum or Optimism post their transaction data to Ethereum (in those blob containers we mentioned), every validator needs to download the complete data to verify it's available. This creates a bottleneck — if blobs get too big or too numerous, validators need expensive hardware with high bandwidth to keep up.

The Solution: Create a system where network validators are not required to download entire blobs of data, but instead just need small samples of these blobs for verification. 

Imagine a library where instead of reading an entire book to confirm it's complete and undamaged, you could randomly check a few pages. If enough people check different random pages and they all look good, you can be confident the whole book is intact. That's essentially what PeerDAS does.

With PeerDAS, validators only need to download approximately 12.5% of the blob data — they sample random portions and share that information with peers. Through mathematical techniques called ""erasure coding"" (which adds redundancy to data, like a sophisticated backup system), the network can reconstruct the full data from just 50% of the pieces. This means:

Validators need 85% less bandwidth compared to downloading everything.

Storage requirements drop significantly for individual nodes.

The network can safely support many more blobs without overwhelming validators.

Home stakers can continue participating without needing enterprise-grade internet connections.

Think of it this way: instead of everyone at a concert recording the entire show, a few people record different parts, and if you need the full concert later, you can piece it together from everyone's recordings.

Gas is Ethereum's measure of computational work — every transaction and smart contract operation consumes a certain amount of gas. The gas limit determines how much computation can fit in a single block.

EIP-7935 increases Ethereum's default block gas limit from approximately 36 million to 60 million gas units. This 67% increase means:

More transactions can be processed on Ethereum's main network (Layer 1).

Complex smart contracts have more room to execute without running into limits.

Network throughput improves even before considering Layer 2 benefits.

However, bigger blocks mean validators must process more data. To make sure the network is not overwhelmed, Fusaka also introduces several safety measures such as a block size cap (EIP-7934) and a transaction gas cap (EIP-7825). 

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the computer that executes all smart contracts throughout Ethereum and its Layer 2s. Fusaka includes several enhancements:

EVM Object Format (EOF): Think of this as a cleaner, more efficient programming structure for smart contracts. It separates code from data more clearly, making contracts easier to validate and optimize. For developers, this means faster execution and fewer errors.

New Opcodes (EIP-7742): Opcodes are basic instructions the EVM can execute (like ADD, SUBTRACT, or STORE). Fusaka adds a CLZ (count leading zeros) opcode that makes certain cryptographic operations more efficient. While this sounds niche, it helps with tasks like verifying digital signatures and processing cryptographic proofs.

secp256r1 Support (EIP-7212): This adds support for a different type of digital signature that's commonly used in mobile devices and hardware security modules. Practically, this means you could eventually use your iPhone's Face ID or fingerprint sensor to interact with Ethereum apps instead of managing a seed phrase — making crypto more accessible and secure for everyday users.

The most significant impact of Fusaka is what it enables for Layer 2 rollups — separate blockchains like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and zkSync that bundle thousands of transactions together and post summaries to Ethereum for security.

Current State: After the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, Layer 2 fees dropped from $0.50-$3.00 to around $0.01-$0.10 per transaction — a massive improvement. However, these L2s are already filling up the available blob space during peak usage.

After Fusaka, Layer 2 networks will have:

3.5x more space to post transaction data.

40-60% lower costs as blob fees decrease due to increased supply.

Capacity to handle 100,000+ transactions per second across the entire L2 ecosystem (compared to roughly 12,000 TPS estimates pre-Fusaka).

To put this in perspective, Visa processes about 65,000 TPS on average. Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem post-Fusaka could theoretically exceed this, while maintaining the security and decentralization of Ethereum's base layer.

Fusaka also has several implications on transaction fees during periods of network congestion. EIP-7918 introduces a blob fee reserve system that changes how blob pricing works. 

Instead of blob fees fluctuating wildly based on immediate demand (like gas prices do), excess blob fees get stored in a ""reserve."" When demand spikes and blob fees rise rapidly, the reserve automatically releases fees back into circulation to smooth out price volatility. When demand is low, fees accumulate in the reserve.

What This Means:

More predictable costs for Layer 2 networks.

Better user experience as L2 fees become more stable.

For people running Ethereum validators (the computers that secure the Ethereum network by validating transactions), Fusaka brings welcome relief:

Bandwidth Reduction: PeerDAS cuts the amount of data validators need to download by approximately 85%. If a validator previously needed to download 750 MB of blob data per day, they'd now only need around 112 MB.

Storage Optimization: While validators still need to store blob data temporarily (blobs are kept for about 18 days), the ability to sample data means they don't need to store everything permanently.

Decentralization Benefits: Lower requirements mean more people can run validators from home without needing enterprise-grade internet connections. This strengthens decentralization — one of Ethereum's core values.

Even if you just hold ETH and occasionally make transactions, Fusaka impacts you:

Cheaper L2 Transactions: If you use Layer 2 networks for trading, NFTs, or DeFi, your transaction costs will decrease by an estimated 40-60%. That $0.05 transaction might drop to $0.02-$0.03.

Improved Network Performance: With higher throughput and more efficient data handling, the entire Ethereum ecosystem becomes smoother and more reliable.

If you participate in decentralized finance — lending, borrowing, trading on DEXs, or providing liquidity:

Faster, Cheaper Interactions: Complex DeFi operations on Layer 2 networks will become more affordable. Yield farming strategies that were uneconomical at $0.10 per transaction might make sense at $0.02.

More Sophisticated Decentralized Applications: The increased gas limit and EOF improvements enable more complex smart contracts, potentially leading to innovative DeFi products that weren't previously possible.

For those building on Ethereum:

Improved EVM: The EOF enhancements make smart contracts easier to write, test, and optimize. Code separation improves security and reduces bugs.

New Tools: The CLZ opcode and secp256r1 support open up new possibilities, particularly for cryptographic applications and mobile-friendly wallet experiences.

Scalability Infrastructure: With blob capacity expanding, developers can build applications that would have been throttled by data availability constraints under the old system.

For teams running rollups like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, or zkSync:

Increased Capacity: The ability to post more data to Ethereum means these networks can process more transactions without hitting bottlenecks.

Lower Operating Costs: As blob fees stabilize and capacity increases, the cost of settling to Layer 1 decreases, savings that can be passed to users.

Competitive Advantage: L2s that efficiently utilize the new blob space can offer the fastest and cheapest transactions, attracting more users and developers.

For those securing the network:

Lower Barriers to Entry: Reduced bandwidth requirements mean the cost to set up a network validator decreases, potentially increasing the number of validators and node operators throughout the network.

Simplified Operations: The improvements to network protocols and deterministic block proposer selection (knowing in advance when you'll propose blocks) make validator operations more predictable.

Institutional adoption of Ethereum has been growing, and Fusaka could accelerate this trend:

Infrastructure Maturity: Major upgrades that execute successfully without network disruptions demonstrate Ethereum's technical maturity — a key consideration for institutions managing billions in assets.

Competitive Positioning: By significantly improving scalability while maintaining security and decentralization, Fusaka helps Ethereum defend against competitors like Solana that have traditionally emphasized speed over decentralization.

Beyond short-term price movements, Fusaka represents a strategic milestone:

The Scalability Race: Competing blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, and newer L1s constantly improve their technology. Fusaka demonstrates Ethereum's ability to scale significantly while preserving decentralization.

Layer 2 Ecosystem Growth: With over 50% of DeFi value locked on Ethereum-related chains, scaling Layer 2s effectively expands Ethereum's addressable market without fragmenting liquidity.

Developer Retention: By consistently upgrading the EVM and providing better tools, Ethereum maintains its position as the preferred platform for serious developers, which drives long-term value.

After Fusaka, Ethereum's next major upgrade is tentatively called ""Glamsterdam"" (combining ""Glamour"" and ""Amsterdam,"" the city hosting a future Devcon), expected in 2026.

While specifics remain under discussion, the Ethereum roadmap continues with:

The Surge (ongoing): Further scalability improvements beyond Fusaka, potentially including full Danksharding (the complete vision of which PeerDAS is just the first step).

The Verge: Introducing Verkle Trees (partially included in Fusaka) to make nodes even lighter and enable ""stateless clients"" that can verify the chain without storing complete state.

The Purge: Simplifying the protocol by removing historical data and technical debt, making Ethereum easier to run and maintain.

The Splurge: Various improvements including account abstraction enhancements, MEV (miner extractable value) solutions, and cryptographic upgrades.

Ethereum's ultimate goal remains unchanged: become a global settlement layer that's:

Scalable: Handle millions of transactions per second through Layer 2s

Secure: Maintain robust security through thousands of independent validators

Decentralized: Enable anyone to run a node or validator without prohibitive costs

Fusaka represents a major step toward this vision by proving that scalability and decentralization aren't mutually exclusive—you can have both through clever engineering like PeerDAS.

The Fusaka upgrade marks a pivotal moment in Ethereum's continued development. By introducing PeerDAS, increasing the gas limit, and implementing numerous smaller improvements, Fusaka transforms Ethereum from a blockchain that can support some Layer 2 activity into one that can sustain a massive ecosystem of scaling solutions processing hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.

For everyday users, this means cheaper transactions and more responsive applications. For developers, it means better tools and the infrastructure to build more ambitious products. For validators, it means lower barriers to participation and a more sustainable network to secure. And for Ethereum as a whole, it means defending its position as the leading smart contract platform while staying true to its decentralization principles.

The crypto market failed to make a meaningful recovery on Tuesday as it continued to languish in ""extreme fear"" territory following a sell-off on Monday that appears to have eroded investor confidence.

Bitcoin traded around $87,000, down from last week's high of $92,350 as the broader market continued to exhibit weakness despite hopes that there would be a ""Santa rally"" in December.

The altcoin market wasn't looking much better. Several tokens posted losses of more than 5% over the past 24 hours, led by privacy coins.

Bitcoin has now retraced almost the entire Nov. 21-28 rally, underperforming U.S. equities. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 6.6% in the same period.

Renowned investor and media personality Kevin O'Leary said Monday that altcoins are no longer bouncing back after market corrections, as investor attention is now solely on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH).

O'Leary said in an X post that investors have realized owning only the two coins is enough to capture 97.5% of all the cryptocurrency market's “alpha.”

“If you own those two, it doesn't matter what happens anywhere else because everything else is moving with a much higher  [volume] to the downside and not recovering anymore because they have no use case,” O'Leary, also known as “Mr Wonderful,” argued.

He added that, unlike previous corrections, altcoins in the current market haven't bounced back as expected.

Notably, CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index had a value of 23 as of this writing, indicating a “Bitcoin Season.” Altcoin Season typically happens if 75% of the top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin in the last 90 days.

On the other hand, the total market share of altcoins rose from 28.2% to 29.5%. At the same time, Bitcoin's dominance fell from 59.2% to 58.9%, while Ethereum's share shrank from 12.6% to 11.5%.

O'Leary's stance on the two blue-chip assets has been clear for some time. In September, he said that owning these two cryptocurrencies can capture the majority of the market's volatility and yield. He advised his followers to avoid chasing “irrelevant tokens.”

He also noted a shift in investment habits among Gen Zs. Earlier in August, he said that younger investors are purchasing Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside traditional stocks, a trend he did not see when he began investing.

Price Action: At the time of writing, BTC was exchanging hands at $86,961.70, up 0.94% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. ETH traded down 0.50% at $2,804.71 at last check.

US

He cannot be both SAPM and chairman of the regulatory authority

Bilal Bin Saqib, Pakistan's Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain, has resigned from his post as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Blockchain and Crypto in order to comply with bureaucratic regulations, The Express Tribune has learnt.

Rumours that the crypto ministry was shutting down started circulating on WhatsApp on Tuesday. ""The crypto developments for Pakistan are still ongoing and the minister is speaking at Binance Blockchain Week on Wednesday, December 3, in Dubai,"" said a staffer informed of the changes.

Saqib had to resign because the Rules of Business 1973 say that you cannot be an SAPM if you are the chairman of a statutory regulatory authority such as the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority.



A copy of the resignation was acquired by The Express Tribune.

Saqib was appointed Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Blockchain and Crypto with the status of Minister of State in May 2025. He has been leading Pakistan's national blockchain strategy and helped with the establishment of the regulatory authority of which he is currently chairman.

The Pakistan Crypto Council, formally established earlier this year, continues to operate as a national force for crypto policy, innovation, youth empowerment, and international engagement in crypto and blockchain.

Pakistan is home to over 50 million crypto users, with an annual trading volume exceeding $300 billion. The country consistently ranks in the top 5 globally for crypto adoption, reflecting its strong grassroots engagement with digital assets. Out of a population of 240 million, 70% of Pakistanis are under the age of 30.

Pakistan boasts a highly favorable demographic for widespread crypto adoption, making it one of the most promising emerging markets for blockchain and digital finance innovation. Pakistan is also the third-largest freelancer market in the world, showcasing its dynamic and entrepreneurial digital workforce.

Who is Bilal Bin Saqib?

A London-based entrepreneur, Bilal Bin Saqib has been at the forefront of digital innovation and social impact. Recognized by King Charles III, the late Queen Elizabeth II, and the Mayor of London, Saqib's work spans across blockchain technology, crypto investments, and social entrepreneurship.

In 2023, he was awarded an MBE (Member of the British Empire) for his humanitarian efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which he led the One Million Meals initiative, delivering over 100,000 meals to NHS staff and vulnerable populations across the UK.

His academic credentials include a Master's in Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship from the London School of Economics (LSE). He also received the 1632nd Points of Light Award, a recognition granted by the British Prime Minister to individuals making outstanding contributions to their communities.

Beyond his work in fintech, Saqib co-founded Tayaba, a social enterprise focused on Pakistan's water crisis, introducing the H2O Wheel, an innovative water transportation device designed to ease the burden on rural communities.

The Stable.com platform integrates non-custodial exchange with Unlimit's global payments infrastructure so that users can swap and off-ramp across all major stablecoins, the company said in a Tuesday (Dec. 2) press release.

The platform enables gasless, zero-commission conversions across all leading stablecoins; provides native off-ramp of stablecoins into local currencies worldwide; and allows users to retain full control of their funds, according to the release.

“Stable.com leverages Unlimit's unrivalled global payments infrastructure, developed over the past 16 years, to seamlessly connect the world of DeFi with traditional finance,” Unlimit CEO and founder Kirill Eves said in the release. “Today, we empower the crypto industry to evolve, advance and unlock its full potential.”

Stablecoin adoption has set its sights beyond the cryptocurrency market liquidity for which it was used for years, aiming for potentially practical, real-world solutions, PYMNTS reported in March.

While stablecoins have become fundamental instruments in global trade, remittances and decentralized finance, each transaction involves a complex network of operational, technical and security frameworks, PYMNTS reported in May.

“The biggest problem in crypto is not adoption, it's the user experience,” Mesh CEO and co-founder Bam Azizi told PYMNTS at the time. “You need to make payments so simple that even a grandmother will use it one day, maybe without even knowing that the mechanism behind the scenes is a stablecoin … to do that, you need to do a lot of heavy lifting.”

Following the passage of new U.S. cryptocurrency legislation, the GENIUS Act, stablecoin payment volume ballooned to more than $10 billion in August, according to blockchain data provider Artemis Analytics.

That figure was up from $6 billion in February and more than twice the volume from August 2024. Artemis Analytics said stablecoin payments could reach $122 billion over a full year.

“It's well understood that stablecoins have graduated from merely being a tool used by crypto traders and exchanges to conveniently move money around without relying on banks, to a more widely used tool for consumer and enterprise payments,” the company said.

Colle AI, the multichain AI-driven NFT creation platform, unveiled its new Logic-Free Creator Assembly system, an adaptive composition engine designed to eliminate the need for manual workflow construction when generating blockchain-ready digital assets. The system introduces a next-generation assembly layer that automatically interprets creator intent and instantly forms complete asset structures—allowing users to move from idea to ready-to-publish output in seconds. This breakthrough further strengthens Colle AI's position as a leader in ultra-fast, AI-powered creative infrastructure built for multichain environments.

The Logic-Free Creator Assembly system works by analyzing prompts, stylistic directives, object relationships, and visual context without requiring creators to design multi-step processes or configure assembly logic. Instead, Colle AI's intelligence orchestrates every stage of asset construction—from foundational structure to visual alignment, metadata preparation, and cross-chain formatting—entirely in the background. This advancement removes friction for artists, brands, and developers who rely on fast iteration cycles, enabling them to bypass complex tools and focus solely on creative direction while the platform handles structural decisions automatically.

Integrated with Colle AI's existing multichain pipelines, the new logic-free layer ensures each asset is instantly compatible with the technical requirements of chains such as Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, BNB Chain, and the XRP Ledger. The system dynamically adapts composition outputs to meet chain-specific metadata and formatting standards, ensuring assets produced without logic assembly remain robust, consistent, and ready for deployment. “Logic-Free Creator Assembly represents a major shift in how creators engage with AI and NFT production,” said J. King Kasr, Chief Scientist at KaJ Labs. “By removing workflow construction entirely, Colle AI gives users the most direct path from imagination to multichain deployment.”

As Colle AI continues to evolve its intelligent creative infrastructure, the introduction of this assembly layer supports its broader mission of delivering adaptive, high-speed AI systems that transform how artists and innovators build across Web3. The Logic-Free Creator Assembly system lays the groundwork for future enhancements in generative design, modular automation, and real-time multichain publishing—bringing the platform closer to its vision of frictionless, intelligence-driven digital creation.

UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity Magazine

The UK's data protection regulator has launched a review of the mobile gaming sector, following parents' concerns that titles may be breaking privacy laws.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said yesterday that it would be scrutinizing 10 popular mobile games.

It will check their compliance with its Children's code requirements regarding default privacy settings, geolocation controls, targeted advertising practices, and anything else identified in the review process.

“Children's online experiences are shaped not just by social media and video sharing platforms, but also by the games they play,” explained information commissioner, John Edwards.

“Our early review suggests that many mobile games' design features can be especially intrusive, raising important questions about how these games are designed and experienced, and their adherence to the ICO's Children's code standards.”

Read more on children's online safety: Social Media Firms Fail to Protect Children's Privacy, Says ICO.

According to ICO research:

Also known as the Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), the Children's code is a set of 15 steps that digital service providers must follow to ensure they're complying with data protection law (UK GDPR) in upholding children's privacy rights.

The ICO claimed that similar scrutiny of social media and video-sharing platforms resulted in “significant progress” towards improving data protection practices.

The regulator has already issued a notice of intent to fine both Imgur and Reddit after an investigation into how the platforms use UK children's personal information, and their age assurance measures.

Edwards has in the past warned that not only big-name US providers face potential scrutiny in this area. In March, he said that organizations of all sizes should “get your own house in order.”

In 2023, TikTok was fined a massive $368m by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) for GDPR failings related to the processing of children's information.

It's not just on this side of the Atlantic where regulators are cracking down on companies whose products are used by children. In 2023, Microsoft paid $20m to settle an FTC case alleging it collected personal information from Xbox Live users it knew were children.

In the US, such matters usually fall under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).","{'href': 'https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com', 'title': 'Infosecurity Magazine'}","cryptocurrency"

The ICO says around 90 percent of children in the UK play games on digital devices and 84 percent of parents are concerned about potential exposure to strangers or harmful content.

To address this, the ICO says it will review the top ten most popular mobile games, assessing their compliance with privacy settings, geolocation controls, and targeted advertising practices. The organization will also review any other privacy issues raised in the process.

“Children's online experiences are shaped not just by social media and video sharing platforms, but also by the games they play. Our early review suggests that many mobile games' design features can be especially intrusive, raising important questions about how these games are designed and experienced, and their adherence to the ICO's Children's code standards,” explains John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner.

“We're expanding our strategy to ensure that mobile games meet the same high standards of data protection we've driven across other platforms.”

The ICO previously announced its Children's Code Strategy, which has seen a number of social networks and video sharing platforms make changes to the way they manage data protection for children. 

The strategy has seen popular platforms introduce changes such as giving children private profiles by default, and restricting the visibility of child users.

Monad, the parallelized EVM Layer 1 blockchain that launched its token last week, took investors on a wild ride, after the token nearly doubled from its ICO price, only to erase all its gains and dip below the $2.5 billion sale valuation this morning.

MON has recovered slightly this afternoon, trading back above its ICO price of $0.025 after falling as low as $0.0225.

While investors and airdrop recipients enjoyed the token's strong price action in its opening 72 hours, MON has fallen back in line with the rest of the crypto market, which continues to struggle.

Monad's mainnet has only been live for seven days, and is currently the 36th-largest blockchain by DeFi total value locked (TVL) with just $151 million according to DeFiLlama.

It is worth noting that Monad has been left with big shoes to fill, as the last major Layer 1 launch, Plasma, achieved more than $2 billion in TVL on its opening day. 

Most chains start off slower, with Hyperliquid's HyperEVM perhaps being a fairer comparison. HyperEVM took more than two months to break above the $500 million TVL mark, and reached as high as $2.7 billion in September, roughly 10 months after its launch.

DeFi protocols deployed on Monad are still rolling out incentives for the chain's bootstrapping period, with Euler Finance, currently the fifth largest protocol by TVL on Monad, announcing new borrow incentives today. 

Even though its DeFi TVL is lagging, overall activity on Monad remains strong. Over the last seven days, Monad was the seventh busiest chain by total transactions, with more than 19 million unique transactions, surpassing Arbitrum and Avalanche, which each recorded roughly 16 million transactions.

The United Arab Emirates and China have conducted the first cross-border transaction using a central bank digital currency (CBDC) on mBridge.

The transaction was commissioned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE's Vice President, who also chairs the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE). Alongside him were Pan Gongsheng and Khaled Mohamed Balama, the governors of the Chinese and UAE central banks, respectively.

HH Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Vice President, Deputy Prime Minister, Chairman of the Presidential Court, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE), executed the first-ever cross-border payment using central bank digital currency… pic.twitter.com/4NvvEVC5Aw

The inaugural transaction was conducted on Jisr, a new platform built to support cross-border CBDC payments. Developed in collaboration with Chinese and UAE commercial banks, the platform is designed to offer low-cost and instant transactions, initially focusing on the UAE-China corridor before expanding to other mBridge members in 2026.

The transaction was a landmark moment for mBridge, a project whose evolution over the past few years has been swift but controversial. mBridge originally started as a joint CBDC project between Thailand and Hong Kong under Project Inthanon‑LionRock. China soon joined, as did Thailand, the UAE, and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). BIS would later exit, with experts pointing to China's growing influence and the continued links to BRICS as key factors.

Beyond the inaugural transaction, the two countries have interlinked their instant payment systems: the UAE's Instant Payment System and China's Internet Banking Payment System.

The interlinkage allows both nations to conduct secure, instant, and round-the-clock cross-border payments.

“This milestone represents a pivotal step towards developing an advanced and secure payment infrastructure, enhancing trade exchange, improving the efficiency and reliability of cross-border payments, and contributing to the strengthening of economic ties between the two countries,” CBUAE noted in its announcement.

Additionally, the two launched a new multi-scheme prepaid card, jointly issued by the UAE's Jaywan and China's UnionPay.

“The launch of the ‘Jisr' platform and the interlinking of instant payment systems…represent tangible steps towards developing a modern and secure financial infrastructure that fosters innovation and facilitates seamless cross-border payments,” commented Sheikh Mansour.

mBridge's progress comes despite a looming threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to impose massive tariffs on BRICS members who turn to payment alternatives that bypass the U.S. dollar. The threat has made some, like South Africa, wary of any de-dollarization efforts.










However, others, led by China, are forging ahead despite the threats, and according to experts, mBridge is one of the projects that will likely outlive Trump's tariff threats.

“I would keep my head down and carry on with the development, carry on with the testing, carry on adding certain lines of trade to mBridge settlement…the four years [of Donald Trump's presidency] will go past pretty quickly,” commented Tom Keatinge, a director at the London-based Royal United Services Institute.

Others have warned that Trump's threats could be the tailwind that spurs mBridge and other BRICS initiatives. Syed Akbaruddin, India's former envoy to the UN, told the Economic Times that China, Russia, and other emerging economies are increasingly seeking alternatives to the U.S.; a low-cost cross-border payment system like mBridge could be the glue that brings these efforts together.

Saudi Arabia launches real estate tokenization infrastructure

In the neighboring Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the government has launched a national real estate tokenization infrastructure and tokenized the first title deed.

The platform was developed by the Real Estate General Authority (REGA), a public agency responsible for overseeing the private real estate sector in the country. It enables the tokenization of any property and the fractionalization of its shares, which opens up the sector to retail investors.

The inaugural tokenized asset was sold to dozens of investors by the National Housing Company, the government's real estate and housing department.

REGA deployed the platform on blockchain technology developed by SettleMint, a Belgian blockchain-as-a-service provider.

“Saudi Arabia is now at the forefront of a global movement redefining how nations manage, invest, and transact in real-world assets. The Kingdom's leadership has built not just technology, but trust – the essential foundation for any programmable economy,” commented SettleMint CEO Adam Popat.

According to REGA, Saudi Arabia's real estate sector contributes around 12% of the country's GDP, with one report projecting that it will reach $201 billion by 2030.

The Saudi Arabian government becomes one of the first in the world to venture into property tokenization, an industry traditionally dominated by private firms. Deloitte estimates that over $4 trillion worth of real estate will be tokenized by 2035.

The bank sees no need to deploy a retail CBDC anytime soon, but it will explore wholesale options.

The South African Reserve Bank says that although retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could help address gaps in the country's payment system, developing one is not a priority for now. 

Instead, the bank will focus on strengthening its existing digital payment innovations to improve the financial system.

The South African Reserve Bank disclosed this in a newly released position paper and background note, published together late last month to outline its recent work on CBDCs and digital payments.

According to the bank, despite innovations in digital payments and growth in their adoption and use, cash remains the most preferred medium of exchange.  

Regardless, the bank is unsure whether it can run a CBDC project alongside other initiatives it has embarked upon to develop the country's National Payments System (NPS). 

SARB is unconvinced that CBDCs can displace cash as a preferred method of payment because a viable CBDC would need several other factors in place for it to be effective. 

South Africa has joined the list of African countries delaying the rollout of a CBDC after initially signaling an intention to launch one.

The Eurosystem is to launch a call for expression of interest during the first quarter of 2026 to invite European payment service providers (PSPs) to participate in a digital euro pilot in 2027.

The announcement follows the European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council's recent decision to progress to the next phase of the digital euro project. A final decision on whether to issue a digital euro – a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for the 20-member eurozone – and on what date, will only be taken once legislation has been adopted.

The pilot is expected to last for 12 months ‘with a view to validating the technical, functional and operational readiness' of the digital euro, according to a ECB press announcement (28 November), which states that companies participating will not be remunerated.

‘These exercises will involve validating digital transaction processes in a controlled environment with a limited number of participants,' the ECB explains. ‘These digital transactions will be designed to replicate the digital euro's technical design but they will not have legal tender status.'

The pilot will involve ‘only Eurosystem staff, selected merchants that already provide everyday services on the office premises of the ECB and of euro area national central banks (for example, cafeterias or restaurants), as well as selected e-commerce,' its announcement continues. Eurosystem staff will have the opportunity to make payments from person-to-person (both online and offline) and from person-to-business (both at a physical point of sale and in e-commerce).

The ECB announced on 30 October that it was moving to the next phase of its development of a digital euro and targeting 2029 for potential issuance.

Under an assumption that European co-legislators will adopt a regulation on the establishment of the digital euro next year (2026), a pilot exercise and ‘initial transactions' could take place as of ‘mid-2027,' the Frankfurt-headquartered authority announced.

The Eurosystem – which comprises the ECB and the national central banks of the 20 European Union (EU) member states whose currency is the euro – ‘should then be ready for a potential first issuance of the digital euro during 2029,' it said.

The Governing Council gave the widely expected nod to proceed with the next phase following European leaders' request to accelerate progress on the initiative.

A two-year digital euro ‘preparation phase', which itself followed a two-year ‘investigation phase', has just been completed.

These earlier phases already involved substantial engagement with the private sector, for example through an ‘innovation platform' for experimentation with market participants (now in a second round of experimentation); and, more significantly, through the selection of providers for digital euro ‘components and related services' – in a 2 October announcement, the ECB named the companies selected (through a procurement process) as ‘first-ranked' providers for ‘framework agreements' in five activity fields. The agreements, which effectively set the terms for potential future work, have a total estimated spend of €432.1m (about £377m) and a potential maximum spend of €1.164 billion (just over £1 billion).

The ECB provides a seven-page ‘Declaration of intent to launch a call for expression of interest' document in which it describes participation in the pilot activities as ‘a unique opportunity for PSPs to help shape the next generation of digital payments in Europe.'

‘The pool of selected payment service providers will need to ensure representative coverage of the euro area market in terms of size, geographical coverage and market reach,' the ECB states.

Selected payment service providers will collaborate with the Eurosystem to develop and test pilot payment use cases.

‘Selected participants will gain first-hand experience of a simulated digital euro ecosystem and their feedback will further shape its technical specifications,' the ECB states.

The pilot will have four main phases: ‘assessment', ‘preparation', ‘implementation' and ‘execution'.

It will cover four use cases: ‘online P2P [person-to-person] transactions using an alias or digital means of payment access number'; ‘offline P2P transactions with NFC [near-field communication]'; ‘online P2B [person-to-business] transactions with NFC at SoftPOS [Software Point-of-Sale]'; and ‘online e- and m-commerce [mobile commerce] transactions'.

In a separate development, the ECB Governing Council has recently decided to further advance ongoing initiatives to interlink the Eurosystem's TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) service with other fast payment systems globally.

The decision followed positive findings of exploratory work begun in October 2024 to connect TIPS with India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and with Nexus Global Payments – a multilateral payment scheme aiming to super-charge the speed of cross-border transactions.

More specifically, the Governing Council has decided to: start a ‘realisation phase' for interlinking TIPS with UPI while completing legal arrangements and technical implementation; and ‘continue exploring the feasibility of a potential connection to Nexus Global Payments while in parallel completing the necessary legal arrangements and agreements'.

The decision is ‘part of the Eurosystem's overall efforts to make it easier for businesses and consumers in Europe to send and receive payments to and from other countries, including remittances', the ECB said in an announcement (20 November).  

In September 2025 the Governing Council launched work to assess the feasibility of a connection between TIPS and the Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) instant payments system.

After finishing last month on a strong note, markets stumbled into December, tripped over by the sell-off in crypto. 

All three major U.S. indexes snapped their 5-day winning streaks as bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, dropped around 6% to trade below $86,000, putting downward pressure on the stock market. 

It was bitcoin's worst day since March. The digital currency late last month fell below $90,000 for the first time since April and has since struggled to stay above that mark.

Even as odds for the Fed's expected year-end Christmas gift of a rate cut rise, investors seem to have put crypto on the ""naughty list.""

As we head deeper into December, could markets shake off the crypto chill, and will tech stocks be the heroes that keep pushing stocks higher? Watch this space.

Musk throws support behind H-1B visas. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the U.S. has been a beneficiary of talent from India, saying ""I'm certainly not in the school of thought that we should shut down the H-1B program,"" adding that it would be ""very bad.""

Nvidia-Synopsys partnership. The company announced Monday it has purchased $2 billion of Synopsys' common stock as part of a strategic partnership to accelerate computing and artificial intelligence engineering solutions.

Crypto sell-off. Prices of bitcoin and ether plunged on Monday, recording a 5% and 7% fall respectively. A statement by the People's Bank of China on Saturday warning of illegal activities relating to digital currencies heaped pressure on Hong Kong-listed shares of digital assets-related companies on Monday.

Markets slide. All three U.S. indexes tracked the losses in crypto and snapped five day winning streaks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average recording the largest loss with a 0.9% fall. Over in Asia, markets also mostly rose, led by South Korea.

Samsung launches its first multi-folding phone as competition from Chinese brands intensifies

Samsung Electronics on Monday announced the launch of its first multi-folding smartphone as it races to keep pace with innovations from fast-moving rivals. 

The long-anticipated ""Galaxy Z TriFold"" will go on sale in South Korea on Dec. 12, with launches to follow in other markets including China, Taiwan, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates, the company said in a press release. 

The phone will be available in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2026, with more details to be shared later, the South Korean tech giant added. The Galaxy Z Trifold will ship as a single model in black with 16GB of memory and 512GB of storage, priced at 3,594,000 South Korean won ($2,449).

The term Digital Asset Treasury companies, known as DATs or DATCOs, has emerged as one of the biggest buzzwords in the digital currency industry this year, providing investors with a novel way to play crypto — but with new risks. 

A DAT is effectively a publicly-listed entity that holds cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ether and provides investors with exposure to the underlying digital currency. DATs aim to outperform the price action of the cryptocurrency that they hold. 

But with crypto markets seeing a big plunge in recent weeks, the strategies of DATs has come under scrutiny and raised concerns about whether they could add further pressure to an already weak crypto market.

A Digital Asset Treasury is a type of company that buys and holds cryptocurrencies directly on its balance sheet. Investors can buy shares of that entity to get exposure to the underlying digital asset.

The original — and one of the biggest DATs — is Michael Saylor's Strategy which began buying bitcoin in 2020 and has done so ever since. 

But more recently, there has been an explosion of this type of vehicle. In 2021, fewer than 10 companies held bitcoin in their treasuries, according to DLA Piper. That number has since jumped to 190 companies, while another 10 to 20 firms are focused on alternative digital assets as of September, DLA Piper said.

These DATs hold around $100 billion worth of cryptocurrencies combined, according to data from The Block.

The DAT explosion this year has been driven by buoyant crypto markets and more favorable regulation in the United States toward the industry.

But their growth has also come at a time when it's easier than ever to buy cryptocurrencies directly or invest in the asset via other regulated entities like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 

DATs are intended to outperform the underlying assets which they hold. They can achieve this through various strategies to maximise returns. In contrast, ETFs effectively hold the cryptocurrency passively and issue shares backed one-to-one with the actual asset.

DATs can also provide regulatory certainty to investors, according to a note from Macquarie published last week. They ""package crypto assets within SEC-regulated securities,"" the investment bank's analysts said. ""This eliminates regulatory ambiguity and ensures the same public reporting, disclosures, and investor protections as any public equity.""

Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told CNBC that DATs also offer an option to ""institutional and professional investors with regulatory, fiduciary or operational constraints that make direct token ownership or crypto ETFs unsuitable.""

DATs offer unique capabilities that ETFs cannot, employing a range of strategies to enhance investor returns.

To assess the performance of these DATs, a metric known as market net asset value, or mNAV, is closely watched. It compares a company's enterprise value to the value of its digital asset holdings. It can show how much of a premium investors are assigning to a DAT, with an mNAV over 1 signifying a premium.

DATs can use an at-the-market (ATM) equity program to increase their crypto holdings. When its share price exceeds the net asset value of the crypto holdings, a DAT can issue more shares at a premium and therefore raise cash. That allows the DAT to fund the purchase of more crypto — as has been the case for Strategy.

""This creates a crypto-per-share accretive feedback loop: the issuer raises equity, accumulates tokens, and sees its NAV per share increase, further increasing the premium, representing accretive dilution,"" Macquarie explained. 

Staking is another strategy that is employed by DATs. It allows a holder of cryptocurrency to earn yield, similar to interest, on their assets. To stake, an investor effectively locks up their crypto on a blockchain to help the network run better. In return, the investor receives a return in the form of more crypto. However, unstaking crypto can take several weeks, which may limit ETFs and similar products from fully embracing staking, given their need for liquidity and stable asset values.

Staking creates free cash flow that ""can be redeployed into mergers and acquisitions (M&A), token purchases, on-chain opportunities, or shareholder distributions,"" ARK Invest said in a note last month. 

As the market advances, there are likely to be new trading strategies employed by DATs. 

DATs have come into focus amid recent crypto market turmoil, with bitcoin well off its all-time high. 

As crypto prices fall, mNAV may fall under 1, meaning companies are trading at a discount to their crypto holdings. This can create a number of issues. 

""When the crypto market pulls back, DATCOs face pressure and they have a limited menu of realistic responses,"" Alexander said. 

""Some may double‑down and hold, viewing the drop as a buying opportunity for future appreciation. Others may need liquidity, especially those that used financing (e.g. debt, convertible bonds, share issuance) which can force them to sell part of their token holdings.""

And an mNAV premium is key for the DAT market.

""The viability of DATCOs is closely tied to the persistence of an equity premium to NAV. If this premium erodes or reverses to a discount, the model faces significant challenges,"" Macquarie analysts said.

The investment bank also notes that if a DAT's stock price falls or near NAV, equity issuance becomes dilutive, meaning ""new shares issued no longer increase crypto per share, but rather dilute existing shareholders' exposure. This can break the self-reinforcing cycle that sustains the premium.""

Meanwhile, the explosion in the number of DATs and growing interest from investors creates its own risks.

""The sector is becoming increasingly crowded, with capital flowing in according to an established playbook. This influx, however, increases structural fragility. Should any of the key variables - investor sentiment, crypto prices, or capital market liquidity - fall, the DATCO model could unravel,"" Macquarie said.

Strategy has sought to protect itself against the downturn. On Monday, the company announced a $1.44 billion U.S. dollar reserve that was funded by the sale of more stock. The reserve is designed to support the payment of dividends and service debt, Strategy said.

James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said other DATs may follow Strategy's decision to dilute shareholders.

""It is not particularly confidence-inspiring: it highlights both their dependence on, and their expectation of, a recovery in token prices,"" Butterfill told CNBC.

""We do expect token prices to rebound, particularly if the Federal Reserve delivers a December rate cut, which should help these companies avoid forced liquidations. Nevertheless, the episode underscores the inherent fragility of the DAT model.""

If mNAVs continue to fall and DATs don't have the means to keep afloat, they may turn to selling digital tokens which could put pressure on crypto markets.

""As token prices drop, even the highest‑profile DATs have begun scaling back. This can amplify volatility in the broader crypto markets, because DATs are large holders: their sales, even if staggered, increase supply into already weakened liquidity conditions,"" Alexander said. 

For now, DATs' digital currency holdings account for less than 1% of the total crypto market. But as their influence potentially grows, they may have more of an impact on braoder markets.

""As DATCOs scale, their market influence grows; an unwind could weaken a major tailwind for crypto, namely the normalization of digital assets on corporate balance sheets,"" Macquarie said. ""This, in turn, could dampen public equity interest in digital asset exposure, slow crypto ETF inflows, and pressure cryptocurrency prices.""

The DAT space is currently in a bubble, according to Sussex University's Alexander.

""The DATCO model seems to have attracted many entrants driven more by marketing, hype and easy capital than by durable business fundamentals,"" she told CNBC. 

CoinShares' Butterfill said the ""bubble has already decisively burst,"" with many DATs now trading at mNAVs below 1 and a ""clear signal that the market fears"" these companies will be forced to sell their digital assets. 

However, both experts said DATs may evolve in the future.

""Over the longer term, investors are likely to demand a more measured approach,"" Butterfill said. 

""Tolerance for shareholder dilution and for extremely high token concentrations without accompanying revenue streams will diminish. The recent frenzy of token accumulation has, in many ways, undermined the original intent of the DAT concept: credible global companies seeking diversification from fiat-currency and depreciation risks.""

Alexander said that these digital asset treasury firms may also begin to diversify their holdings into non-crypto assets too. 

""I believe those that pivot toward operations such as yield‑generation through staking, increasing the diversification of their tokens, and mix with token traditional assets like cash or T-bills, may survive as legitimate digital‑asset infrastructure players,"" Alexander said.

Oops, something went wrong

(Bloomberg) -- Retail investors who piled into Michael Saylor's grand Bitcoin experiment are paying a heavy price.

Strategy Inc. — the company once hailed for wrapping crypto exposure into a public stock — is scrambling to calm markets after its shares plunged more than 60% from recent highs, amid a sweeping digital-currency rout. On Monday, Strategy said it had created a $1.4 billion reserve to fund dividend and interest payments, hoping to calm fears that it may be forced to sell Bitcoin if prices fall further.

But for many investors, the damage is already done. The most popular exchange-traded funds tracking Strategy's volatile stock — MSTX and MSTU, which offer double the daily return — have both dropped more than 80% this year. That puts them among the 10 worst-performing funds in the entire US ETF market, out of more than 4,700 products currently trading — just behind obscure short bets against gold miners and semiconductor stocks. A third fund, known as MSTP, launched during the crypto mania in June, is down a similar amount since its debut. Together, the trio has lost about $1.5 billion in assets since early October.

Retail investors had poured into these funds when firms like Defiance and Tuttle Capital Management launched the high-octane products tracking one of Wall Street's most prominent Bitcoin-proxy trades.

But what began as an easy way to supercharge bets on crypto has become a cautionary tale of how leverage, volatility and sentiment can spiral. Strategy shares lost 34% in November. Bitcoin has also dropped about 30% from October highs and now trades near $87,000. Strategy closed down 3.3% on Monday, after slumping as much as 12% earlier in the day.

Bitcoin was up 1.2% as of 8:36 a.m. in New York on Tuesday.

“The recent pullback in Bitcoin has hit Strategy's stock hard, and 2x leveraged plays like MSTX and MSTU turn that into even larger losses,” said Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at ETF shop TMX VettaFi. “It's a reminder that leveraged single-stock ETFs can look great on the way up, but can erase gains very quickly when the underlying trade goes the other way.”

Defiance declined to comment. GraniteShares, which is behind MSTP, didn't comment. Matt Tuttle of Tuttle Capital Management said Strategy's shifting valuation relative to its Bitcoin stash creates both long and short opportunities for traders.

“When it's at a premium, especially a large one, then having an inverse can be a great tool,” Tuttle said. “When it's at a discount, which I think it is now, then that could be a great time to go long with leverage.” Strategy's market cap is currently below the value of its holdings.

At the center of concern is another key valuation metric known as mNAV — or market net asset value — which compares Strategy's enterprise value to its Bitcoin holdings. That premium has largely vanished, bringing the ratio to around 1.15 — a level executives have flagged as a warning zone. CEO Phong Le said on a podcast that slipping below 1.0 could force the company to sell Bitcoin to meet payout obligations, albeit only as a last resort.

The newly announced reserve, funded by recent equity sales, is designed to head off that risk. It covers at least 21 months of dividend and interest payments. But the announcement did little to stop the broader slide — or address concerns about Strategy's exposure to leverage, its dependence on retail appetite, and the mounting strain on its funding model.

To finance its Bitcoin buying spree, Strategy has repeatedly sold common stock, a controversial strategy that dilutes existing shareholders. As its valuation premium has eroded, the company has turned to issuing preferred shares and other costlier forms of capital to keep buying crypto.

Meanwhile, the ETF complex built around Strategy is struggling. At least 15 such products tied to its shares in various ways are now trading — many down double digits this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Combined assets for MSTX, MSTU and MSTP have fallen from over $2.3 billion in early October to around $830 million today.

Crypto's downturn — despite greater institutional participation and political support from the Trump White House — has triggered sharp drawdowns across miners, altcoins, and token-heavy corporate treasuries. Leveraged ETFs, which gained traction among at-home traders earlier this year, are now among the hardest hit.

The funds are built to double Strategy's daily moves — a structure that can backfire fast. In volatile markets, compounding gains and losses can chip away at returns even if the stock ends flat, a dynamic known as volatility decay. When Strategy shares tumbled and whipsawed, the ETFs didn't just track the decline — they magnified it.

“Leveraged ETFs are generally a dangerous investment. A leveraged ETF on shares of a stock that levers up to buy a highly speculative asset is a risk profile of its own,” said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading.

Now, even Strategy's place in major stock indexes is under threat. Analysts at JPMorgan warned the company could be removed from benchmarks like the MSCI USA and Nasdaq 100 — a shift that might trigger billions in passive outflows. For a firm once floated as a potential S&P 500 candidate, the reversal is stark.

""The Big Short"" investor Michael Burry has said the hype around bitcoin is getting out of hand.

Burry called the blockchain-based currency the ""tulip bulb of our time"" on a podcast hosted by ""The Big Short"" author Michael Lewis, which aired on Tuesday, referencing the hype-driven tulip bubble crash in the 1600s.

""I think that bitcoin at $100,000 is the most ridiculous thing,"" said Burry, who described the cryptocurrency as ""not worth anything."" 

""It's worse than a tulip bulb, because this has enabled so much criminal activity to go deep under,"" Burry told Lewis, who wrote about the investor's famous bet against the housing market in the run-up to the financial crash in his 2010 book.

Bitcoin was up around 1.5% early Tuesday at about $88,700. The digital currency hit a record high of over $120,000 in October but has fallen more than 30% since then.

Burry's attack on bitcoin is the latest salvo in the famed short-seller's action-packed return to the public sphere.

After years of silence, Burry disclosed big bets against market darlings Nvidia and Palantir last month. The former hedge fund boss also called Tesla ""ridiculously overvalued"" and has issued regular warnings about the AI bubble on X and his newly-launched Substack.

It's not the first time Burry, who was played by Christian Bale in a 2015 movie adaptation of Lewis' book, has been critical of crypto.

In 2021, Burry warned that although he believed the reasons for bitcoin's existence were ""relevant,"" the cryptocurrency was a ""speculative bubble"" that posed more risk than opportunity.

""If you do not know how much leverage is involved in the run-up, you may not know enough to own it,"" he wrote in a since-deleted tweet.

Tech stocks linked to Bitcoin staged a modest comeback in overnight trading, although it wasn't enough to wipe away the losses they suffered yesterday. The market remains on edge as Bitcoin has lost 21% over the past month. In recent days, it has stabilized at around $87K per coin and was up 0.72% today. Crypto trading platform Coinbase was down 4.76% yesterday but was up 1.37% in overnight trading, while Robinhood was down 4.09% yesterday and then crept up 0.63% this morning, premarket. But the elephant in the digital asset room is Michael Saylor's Strategy, the leading Bitcoin treasury company, whose stock market cap is now worth less than the Bitcoin it holds. It dropped 3.25% yesterday but was up 0.45% before the bell. Strategy's market cap was $50.6 billion at the time of writing, and its 650,000 Bitcoins were worth $56.7 billion. The key metric for Strategy, however, is its “mNAV” (multiple to net asset value), which is a ratio describing the company's theoretical enterprise value (currently $65.2 billion) to its Bitcoin holdings. That ratio was 1.15 this morning, meaning its enterprise value is worth 15% more than its Bitcoin.

However, if the mNAV falls below one, then Strategy faces a crisis: The reason for holding the stock vanishes, and no one will be likely to provide the company with more capital—a period of fierce selling could ensue.

The situation was made more tense after Strategy CEO Phong Le said on a podcast that the company would be willing to sell some of its Bitcoin in order to meet the dividend commitments on its debt and preferred shares. “Now, as we are looking at Bitcoin winter, as we see our mNAV compressing, my hope is our mNAV doesn't go below one,” he said. “But if we do, and we didn't have other access to capital, we would sell Bitcoin.” 

On Monday, the company published an investor presentation which confirmed (on page 11) that it will begin selling Bitcoin if the mNAV falls below one.

The statements were extraordinary because Saylor, the founder, has repeatedly said he would never sell. Strategy currently holds just over 3% of all Bitcoin. If it was forced to sell in order to raise cash, that too would likely start an avalanche. (The company did not immediately respond when contacted for comment.)

Traders betting on leveraged plays against Strategy have already been wiped out. Two exchange-traded funds, MSTX and MSTU, which offered double the returns of the underlying Strategy stock, have lost more than 80% of their value, according to Bloomberg. Together with a third, MSTP, they have lost $1.5 billion in value over the past month.

Strategy shares declined Tuesday after the company said it had created a $1.44 billion “U.S. dollar reserve” to fund its dividends, and had enough cash to survive the next 12 to 24 months, according to the Financial Times.

Some crypto investment experts have a negative outlook. Patrick Horsman, chief investment officer at BNB Plus, another crypto treasury company, told the Wall Street Journal, “I think we could see Bitcoin get all the way back to $60,000 … We don't think the pain is over.”

Bitcoin BTC$91.754,49 surged back above $90,000 during Tuesday's U.S. morning hours, erasing most of its steep plunge from Sunday to Monday to below $84,000. The largest cryptocurrency was recently trading at $91,180, up 8% over the past 24 hours, helping lifting the broader digital asset markets.

Ethereum's ether ETH$3020,65 bounced above $3,000, gaining 9% during the same period. Large-cap altcoins also followed the advance: XRP$2,1743, Solana's SOL SOL$139,68, DOGE$0.1464 were up 7%–10%, recovering from their recent lows.

The gains occurred as $11 trillion asset management giant Vanguard dropped its longstanding fatwa against crypto and will now allow its clients to have access to digital asset ETFs. Alongside, Bank of America has given the okay for its wealth managers to recommend a 1%-4% allocation to the spot bitcoin ETFs.

Mark Connors, founder and chief macro strategist of bitcoin investment advisory Risk Dimensions and former global head of risk advisory at Credit Suisse warns that a rise in Japan's 10-year yield could pull capital away from global markets, with crypto — especially bitcoin — being hit hardest due to its proximity to Asian capital flows and exposure to leverage. Binance, which handles nearly half of all crypto volume and allows leverage of up to 50x, is particularly vulnerable to yen and yuan volatility.

Connors also pointed out that bitcoin appears to be leading the S&P 500 lower. That pattern could continue until both the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan hold their policy meetings later this month. If markets weaken further, he expects some form of intervention, as has often happened during periods of stress in recent years.

Still, not all signals point to weakness. Jasper De Maere, desk strategist at Wintermute, said bitcoin derivatives show a “clear lean toward bullish, short-vol behaviour.” Traders are selling downside puts around the $80,000–$85,000 level while selectively buying upside further out.

“The mix suggests a market that treats $80,000–85,000 as supported and is comfortable leaning long into year-end while earning carry on the way,” De Maere said. In other words, despite near-term pressure, traders appear positioned for a recovery.

Bitcoin briefly broke below $83,000 late Monday, as thin liquidity, a weekend macro scare out of Japan, and mounting fears over a potential MSCI methodology change converged into a fast, disorderly move lower.

Prices hovered above $85,000 during Asian hours on Tuesday morning, with XRP, ether ETH$3,020.65, Cardano's ADA, Solana's SOL and BNB Chain's BNB showing losses upto 2%.

Market participants said the drop had little to do with the usual macro triggers and far more to do with the market's inability to absorb even modest stress in the current environment.

“Bitcoin's drop below $90,000 is the result of a collision between the fragile market structure and weak liquidity conditions observed over the weekend,” said Farzam Ehsani, CEO of crypto exchange VALR.

“The pressure across markets intensified because the order book was shallow, and the market lacked sufficient depth to withstand another macroeconomic liquidity shock,” he added.

Some traders are increasingly focused on a separate structural issue: MSCI's pending decision on whether to exclude companies whose balance sheets are heavily concentrated in cryptocurrencies from its global indices.

The proposal affects firms collectively holding more than $137 billion in digital assets — including Strategy, Marathon, Riot, Metaplanet, and American Bitcoin — representing roughly 5% of all bitcoin in existence.

Ehsani said the market is already attempting to price in the possibility of forced flows from index funds, should any of these companies be reclassified.

“Any rule change automatically triggers a review of their holdings, potentially leading to forced sell-offs of these companies' shares and triggering significant capital flows,” Ehasani said. Investors, he added, are now bracing for “short-term imbalances associated with forced capital flows.”

December's poor start also capped a weak November for bitcoin, which finished down 17.5% in one of its largest monthly declines in three years.

A sustained break below roughly $80,500 would open the door to a deeper move toward the $64,000 technical target watched by some traders.

“If the market continues to decline, Bitcoin could test the $60,000-$65,000 range. At these levels, major institutional players, including Strategy's potential competitors, could become interested in buying up large volumes of Bitcoin,” Ehsani added.

Outside bitcoin, US-listed crypto ETFs continued to see selective inflows. Solana funds have now logged five straight weeks of net buying, adding more than $600 million since late October. Spot XRP ETFs also crossed $666 million in cumulative inflows.

On-chain data from CryptoQuant and Glassnode suggests leverage has been draining from the system, easing some structural risk but not enough to offset the current macro and index-related uncertainty.

Goldman Sachs (GS) buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer for about $2 billion doesn't seem like it has much to do with crypto at first.

However, the Wall Street banking giant's purchase of Innovator Capital has implications that can shake up the entire crypto industry, primarily the ETF sector. That market today is worth $190 billion, but the spot bitcoin BTC$91.754,49 ETF market alone is projected to grow to $3 trillion by 2033.

When the deal was announced, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in a statement that “Active ETFs are dynamic, transformative, and one of the fastest-growing segments in today's public investment landscape,” and “by acquiring Innovator, Goldman Sachs will expand access to modern, world-class investment products.” Bruce Bond, CEO of Innovator, said: “Goldman Sachs has a long history of discerning emerging trends and important directional shifts within the asset management industry.""

The statements speak volumes about how Goldman sees the ETF industry evolving: building a truly ""modern"" platform that will invest in emerging trends, based on investor demand. This could eventually include digital assets.

Why? Just ask BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, which has more than $13.4 trillion in assets under management. The firm manages over 1,400 different ETFs globally, and out of all these funds, according to one of its executives, bitcoin ETFs have become the firm's most profitable product line.

As a reminder, Goldman Sachs already serves as an Authorized Participant for major spot bitcoin ETFs, including those from BlackRock and Grayscale, facilitating their daily trading. And while Innovator primarily focuses on defined outcome ETFs, it has responded to the increasing demand for crypto exposure with structured ETFs such as the Innovator Uncapped Bitcoin 20 Floor ETF (QBF), which provides investors with exposure to bitcoin through a risk-managed strategy.

“Not only does this give them an ETF manufacturing scale in one shot, but it also opens up a pre-engineered, compliant channel for pushing buffered bitcoin exposure through private banks, RIAs and wealth platforms that crypto-native issuers struggle to access,” Anna Tutova, AI Crypto Minds founder and family offices' advisor told CoinDesk.

Simply put, crypto is becoming another Wall Street product that traditional financial institutions want to get exposure to as investors demand new, innovative products and asset classes. ETFs are becoming the distribution channel for that demand.

This raises a long-standing debate about why cryptocurrency was created: to provide an alternative financial system that addresses the problems of legacy financial systems.

However, crypto needs mass adoption if it is to stand toe-to-toe with traditional finance and government oversight. And to do that, it needs the very institutions, such as BlackRock, Goldman and even the governments it meant to rival.

“This deal pretty much sums up 2025 as the year when the legitimacy of crypto has been validated by governments and big players,"" said Anastasiia Bobeshko, an independent strategic Web3 adviser.

And this is where many industry participants sound the alarm.

“Crypto is becoming just another Wall Street investment tool, not the alternative system it set out to be,"" said AI Crypto Minds' Tutova.

Trevor Koverko, a co-founder of Sapien and Polymath, echoed the sentiment, saying that Goldman Sachs' potential crypto ETF move is “good for adoption, dangerous for the ethos."" Wall Street ETFs bring scale plus liquidity, but if we stop at ‘number go up in brokerage accounts,' we've just rebuilt the old system on new assets. ETFs should be the on-ramp, not the destination,” he told CoinDesk.

So while Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs are pushing further into crypto, legitimizing the industry and preparing it for further adoption, it might fail to uphold the original vision of the cypherpunks and even Bitcoin's mysterious founder (or founders), Satoshi Nakamoto. 

“Satoshi positioned Bitcoin against corrupt systems like the banking system,” said Kadan Stadelmann, Komodo Platform CTO.

“Now massive corporations like BlackRock and Fidelity have become dominant crypto players, changing Bitcoin inherently. It is no longer a political tool based on self-custody, but, rather, a financial tool for wealth preservation and diversification.”

Bitcoin BTC$91,754.49 traders are increasingly taking defensive positions, bracing for a potential price drop below $80,000 in the new year. 

""Skew's sharp step lower shows traders stacking puts, especially into the December 26 expiry, where open interest has concentrated at the $84K and $80K strikes,"" Nick Forster, co-founder of Derive, said in a market note.

""That positioning implies a meaningful probability of sub-$80K BTC to start 2026,"" he added.

As of writing, BTC changed hands near $87,000, representing a 30% decline from the record high of over $126,000 hit on Oct. 8, according to CoinDesk data.

Forster said that the downtrend may not be over and market participants are pricing  a volatile December. ""I don't believe the bottom is in. Short-dated volatility now sits above long-dated BTC volatility, signaling that the market expects outsized swings as we head into the new year,"" Forster said.

This Is the Math at the Heart of Reality

Mathematics is not only an esoteric vocation but also indispensably alive and deeply human

By Andrea Gawrylewski 

Scientific American

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

In October 2024 Luke Durant, an independent researcher in San Jose, Calif., announced that he had discovered the largest known prime number—so enormous it would take years to write out in full. One might suspect only mathematicians would celebrate such a feat. But primes are often considered the building blocks of mathematics, and math itself is the scaffolding that supports everything from quantum theory and smartphone algorithms to the stability of bridges and even the odds at a casino. This special issue invites you to explore that hidden architecture—through paradoxes, proofs, strange shapes and playful puzzles. Mathematics is not only an esoteric vocation but also indispensably alive and deeply human.

Humans are natural mathematicians, and trials have shown that babies are born with an inherent sense of numbers. For some this natural ability leads to a lifelong devotion: in 2023 precocious high school students published a proof of the Pythagorean theorem that uses trigonometry, and the winner of the 2025 Abel Prize in mathematics was Masaki Kashiwara, who has studied the field for nearly seven decades.

The quest for larger primes continues, and researchers are devising new ways to seek them out, including a method that involves integer partitions. Many questions in math have long histories, such as the Langlands conjecture, which has stumped scientists for more than 50 years. The field is replete with paradoxes. For example, if you run the equation 1 – 1 + 1 – 1 + 1 – 1 + ... forever, the answer is not zero and not straightforward. Or consider the following: In a small town, a barber shaves the beards of all men who don't shave their own. Does he shave himself? Such puzzles (and all statistics) rely on probability, which in itself is something of a paradox because no one really knows what it is.

Math, naturally, is integral to physics, cosmology and our comprehension of the universe. So-called complex numbers are a crucial element of quantum theory. And in 2025 a group of mathematicians claimed to have made a breakthrough on “Hilbert's sixth,” one of the core math problems posed in 1900 by German mathematician David Hilbert. The team's lofty proof unifies three physical theories that explain the motion of fluids. Math gives meaning to form, and topology (the math of deformable geometric shapes) is influencing data analytics. Another puzzle that has endured for at least 100 years: find a shape that can cover an infinite plane with patterns that never repeat—an einstein tile.

Math shows up in everyday life in surprising ways. Equations govern the stability of infrastructure such as bridges and airplanes. One of several statistical theories increases the odds of winning at gambling, just as algorithms govern one's success at poker. And a recently developed computational model can optimize citizens' assemblies to make them fair reflections of the populations they represent, improving democracy. Math even addresses the mundane problem of moving a sofa around a corner.

For thousands of years math has shown itself to be a powerful tool for understanding not only the shape of our world but ways to optimize all aspects of life. An invisible equation seems to undergird every facet of reality, including the human mind. In that sense, mathematics is not alien at all but a mirror held up to ourselves.

The collection of markings is now thought to have been left by a herd of ancient sea turtles that had been frightened off by a sudden earthquake.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

83 million years ago, the Cònero Riviera on the eastern shore of Italy was a submerged Cretaceous haven for marine reptiles and fish, including the ancestors of modern sea turtles. But one day, ominous rumblings from below sent them scattering en masse, and their frantic flipper marks were frozen in time.

As climbers were scaling the steep limestone slopes of Monte Cònero in the spring of 2019, they found what appeared to be a stampede of footprints embedded in the rock face. The marks appeared similar to ichnofossils—marks left behind by life-forms, but not the remains of the life forms themselves—on a nearby slab of rock discovered by paleontologist Luca Natali months before. Natali would later attribute the traces to extinct marine reptile Coneroichnus marinus, thought to be a type of pliosaur. 

When the climbers brought digital photos of their find to paleontologist Alessandro Montanari at the Geological Observatory of Coldigioco, he knew the prints were worth pursuing. The sheer cliff where the footprints lie over La Vela Beach is over 328 feet (100 meters) above sea level, but that didn't stop Montanari and his research team. They were able to gain access to Cònero Regional Park (closed to the public because of rockfalls) to survey the area on foot, and sent drones to capture more images with a panoramic view from above.

“We hypothesized that the footprints, which were probably made by a group of medium-sized marine vertebrates paddling towards southwest on a soft pelagic seafloor, were preserved on that oozy sediment because they were immediately buried and sealed under a calcilutitic turbidite,” Montanari said in a study recently published in Cretaceous Research.

What creature could have left so many of these traces as it swam away? Well, during the Late Cretaceous, the only vertebrates to live near the bottom of the ocean were fish and reptiles. While the bones of many marine species have been found preserved in limestone that was once underwater, nothing with prints of their feet, fins, or paddles has ever surfaced. Such prints would not have lasted long on a seafloor of oozing sediment—they would have easily been erased by the flow of water or washed away by deep currents.

Because fish do not paddle on the sand with their fins, Montanari and his team needed to consider the types of marine reptiles that were around during that period. They thought it was possible that the tracks came from either mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, or sea turtles from the extinct lineage Protostegidaae, even though no fossilized remains of these sea turtles or plesiosaurs had been found in the region. Despite the lack of fossil evidence, the researchers contiued to investigate every avenue, going off of previous reports of trackways left by a Triassic nothosaur and a sea turtle that lived during the Late Pleistocene.

While ancient sea turtles and plesiosaurs were both mostly solitary creatures, females of most extant sea turtle species will migrate over long distances and in herds to lay their eggs on tropical beaches. In addition, the Hawaiian green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) and Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) are both known to inhabit shallow reefs, and sometimes swim close to the seafloor and brush the sand with their fore-flippers. The environments in which these turtles live are similar to what Monte Cònero and La Vela beach are imagined to have been like tens of millions of years ago.

“The prevalence of sea turtle species in these environments leads us to hypothesize that the myriad trace fossils of the La Vela Slabs represent a mass displacement of a very large number of these animals,” said Montanari, who thinks the ancient critters were probably foraging when they were spooked. “A sudden earthquake provoked a stampede toward the open sea.”

When the already panicked sea turtles tried to escape, some were so close to the seafloor that they left flipper tracks in their wake. The earthquake released calcilutitic fluxoturbidite—coarse deposits mixed with fine-grained sediment that would turn into limestone—which buried and preserved the soft carbonate sediment and its record of a sea turtle mass exodus. Earthquake activity at this time coincides with the period of climate change known as the Early Campanian Event, which was thought to have been triggered by an asteroid impact.

For any rock climbers who might be exploring places known to be fossil beds, it might be worth keeping some form of camera on hand. It could lead to discovering something that has been waiting to be found for tens or even hundreds of millions of years.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","A New Study Revealed the Secret Origin of One of America's Most Mysterious Monuments","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a69535875/poverty-point/","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:30:00 GMT","

Poverty Point, a 3,500-year-old earthen mound, is a well-researched UNESCO World Heritage Site, but a pair of studies re-examines its original purpose.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Around 1,500 B.C.E., civilization was really starting to take off. Ancient Egypt was entering a golden age known as the New Kingdom, the Hittites took root in the Middle East, the Shang Dynasty came to power in China, and the Olmecs emerged in the tropical lowlands of what would one day be Mexico. At this same time, in the Lower Mississippi Valley—some 350 miles from the mouth of the North America's largest river—the hunter-gatherers of a burgeoning egalitarian society were constructing one of the oldest and most impressive earthwork monuments in the western hemisphere. 

Known today as Poverty Point—a name derived from a 19th-century plantation that was located near the archaeological site—this approximately 3,500-year-old structure (built sometime between 1700 B.C.E. to 1100 B.C.E.) is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. And while the size of the site is certainly impressive, stretching some 1.5 square miles, these ancient peoples also moved the equivalent of 140,000 dump trucks of dirt without the use of horses or even wheels. 

It's long been known that Poverty Point served as a kind of trading hub for ancient hunter-gatherers spread throughout southeastern and midwestern U.S. But in a new study—published in the journal Southeastern Archaeology—archaeologists from Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) re-examine the origin story of this impressive site, asking why ancient peoples built these mounds in the first place.

Typically, years-long intentional monument building is the work of hierarchies, like those of the pharaohs ruling Egyptians, kings governing Hittites, and Chinese rulers lording over their subjects. But Kidder and his co-author Seth Grooms (a former WashU PhD graduate and a member of the Lumbee tribe of North Carolina) believe that Poverty Point was the work of an egalitarian civilization coming to grips with increased severe weather and massive flooding in the region.

This goes against the previously held belief that this society must have also been hierarchical in nature, similar to the society that constructed Cahokia Mounds a thousand years later near present-day St. Louis, Missouri.

“The Western view is that they wouldn't travel all of that distance and do all of that work unless they were getting something of economic value out of it,” the study's co-author, Tristram Kidder, said in the WashU magazine The Ampersand. “We believe they felt a moral responsibility to repair a torn universe.”

One of the key pieces of evidence that Poverty Point held some spiritual significance is that there's never been archeological evidence of permanent dwellings at the location. “The old paradigm that people lived at Poverty Point continuously for centuries has been crumbling, and we needed a new framework,” Kidder told The Ampersand. 

Instead, what they found were materials such as quartz crystal from Arkansas, soapstone from northern Georgia, and pieces of Great Lakes copper. Kidder and Grooms believe that Poverty Point was a temporary gathering spot for people assembled in the thousands to do what humans do: socialize, trade, worship, and work. That makes Poverty Point a bit of a historical outlier in the ancient world, as Grooms said in another article for The Ampersand in 2023. 

“These people came together to build these incredible monuments, and according to the archaeological evidence, they did it in the absence of any kind of institutional hierarchy, wealth differences, or intensive agricultural systems,” Grooms said at the time. “All of that was once thought to be a prerequisite for social complexity.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A hidden Antarctic shift unleashed the carbon that warmed the world","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251202052209.htm","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 12:00:34 GMT","

Around 12,000 years ago, the last Ice Age drew to a close. Global temperatures rose, the early Holocene began, and human communities gradually shifted toward more permanent settlements. A new study published in Nature Geoscience highlights how the Southern Ocean around Antarctica helped drive this major climate transition.

The research team, led by Dr. Huang Huang of the Laoshan Laboratory in Qingdao and including geochemist Dr. Marcus Gutjahr from GEOMAR, set out to reconstruct how far Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) extended through the Southern Ocean over the past 32,000 years.

""We wanted to understand how the influence of Antarctic Bottom Water, the coldest and densest water mass in the global ocean, changed during the last deglaciation, and what role it played in the global carbon cycle,"" says Huang, who completed his PhD at GEOMAR in 2019 and now works as a scientist in Qingdao, China.

Sediment cores and chemical fingerprints in the deep sea

To tackle this question, the scientists examined nine sediment cores collected from the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean. The cores came from water depths between about 2,200 and 5,000 meters and from locations spread widely across the region. By analyzing the isotopic composition of the trace metal neodymium preserved in the sediments, which reflects the chemistry of the surrounding seawater, they could reconstruct how Antarctic Bottom Water changed through time on the scale of tens of thousands of years.

""Dissolved neodymium and its isotopic fingerprint in seawater are excellent indicators of the origin of deep-water masses,"" explains Dr. Marcus Gutjahr. ""In earlier studies, we noticed that the neodymium signature in the deep South Atlantic only reached its modern composition around 12,000 years ago. However, sediments from the last Ice Age showed values that are not found anywhere in the Southern Ocean today. Initially, we thought the method was flawed or that there was something wrong with the sediment core. But the real question was: What could generate such a signal? Such an exotic isotopic signature can only develop when deep water remains almost motionless for extended periods. In such circumstances, benthic fluxes -- chemical inputs from the seafloor -- dominate the isotopic imprint in marine sediments.""

Stagnant deep waters, carbon storage and the last Ice Age

During the last Ice Age, the cold and very dense deep water that currently forms around Antarctica did not spread as widely as it does today. Instead, much of the deep Southern Ocean was filled with carbon-rich waters that originated in the Pacific, a glacial precursor to today's Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). In the study, CDW is described as carbon-rich because it circulates in the deep ocean for long periods with limited contact with the surface. This isolation allowed large amounts of dissolved carbon to remain locked in the deep ocean, helping to keep atmospheric CO2 levels relatively low.

As Earth warmed and ice sheets retreated between roughly 18,000 and 10,000 years ago, the volume of Antarctic Bottom Water increased in two clear phases. These expansion phases occurred at the same time as known warming events in Antarctica. With more vertical mixing in the Southern Ocean, deep waters that had stored carbon for long periods were brought closer to the surface, allowing that carbon to escape into the atmosphere.

""The expansion of the AABW is linked to several processes,"" explains Gutjahr. ""Warming around Antarctica reduced sea-ice cover, resulting in more meltwater entering the Southern Ocean. The Antarctic Bottom Water formed during this transitional climate period had a lower density due to reduced salinity. This late-glacial AABW was able to spread further through the Southern Ocean, destabilizing the existing water-mass structure and enhancing exchanges between deep and surface waters.""

Previously, many scientists assumed that changes in the North Atlantic, particularly the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), were the main drivers of shifts in deep-water circulation in the South Atlantic. The new results suggest that this northern influence was more restricted than earlier thought. Instead, the replacement of a glacial, carbon-rich deep-water mass by newly formed Antarctic Bottom Water appears to have been crucial for the rise in atmospheric CO2 toward the end of the last Ice Age.

Southern Ocean heat, Antarctic ice loss and today's climate

""Comparisons with the past are always imperfect,"" says Gutjahr, ""but ultimately it comes down to how much energy is in the system. If we understand how the ocean responded to warming in the past, we can better grasp what is happening today as Antarctic ice shelves continue to melt.""

Because of its vast size and unique circulation, the Southern Ocean plays a major role in controlling the global climate. Over the past 50 years, waters deeper than about 1,000 meters around Antarctica have warmed significantly faster than much of the rest of the world's oceans. To work out how this rapid deep-ocean warming affects the ability of the ocean to absorb and release carbon dioxide, scientists must track physical and biogeochemical changes over long timescales and incorporate them into climate models.

""I want to properly understand the modern ocean in order to interpret signals from the past,"" Gutjahr says. ""If we can trace how Antarctic Bottom Water has changed over the last few thousand years, we can assess more accurately how rapidly the Antarctic Ice Sheet may continue to lose mass in the future.""

Paleoclimate data obtained from sediment cores are indispensable for this, offering insights into past climates that were warmer than today and helping to improve projections of future climate change.

Last April, neuroscientist Sue Grigson received an e-mail from a man detailing his years-long struggle to kick addiction — first to opioids, and then to the very medication meant to help him quit.

The man had stumbled on research by Grigson, suggesting that certain anti-obesity medications could help to reduce rats' addiction to drugs such as heroin and fentanyl. He decided to try quitting again, this time while taking semaglutide, the blockbuster GLP-1 drug better known as Ozempic. “That's when he wrote to me,” says Grigson, who works at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine in Hershey. “He said that he was drug- and alcohol-free for the first time in his adult life.”

Why do obesity drugs seem to treat so many other ailments?

Why do obesity drugs seem to treat so many other ailments?

Stories like this have been spreading fast in the past few years, through online forums, weight-loss clinics and news headlines. They describe people taking diabetes and weight-loss drugs such as semaglutide (also marketed as Wegovy) and tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro or Zepbound) who find themselves suddenly able to shake long-standing addictions to cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs. And now, clinical data are starting to back them up.

Earlier this year, a team led by Christian Hendershot, a psychologist now at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, reported in a landmark randomized trial that weekly injections of semaglutide cut alcohol consumption1 — a key demonstration that GLP-1 drugs can alter addictive behaviour in people with a substance-use disorder. More than a dozen randomized clinical studies testing GLP-1 drugs for addiction are now under way worldwide, with some results expected in the next few months.

Neuroscientists, meanwhile, are working out how the weight-loss drugs suppress addiction by acting on hormone receptors in brain regions that control craving, reward and motivation. They are finding that GLP-1 therapies help to blunt urges for alcohol, opioids, nicotine and cocaine through some of the same brain pathways that also quell hunger cues and overeating. “At the end of the day, the neurobiological system that is activated by rewarding substances — food, sex, drugs, rock and roll — it's the same system,” says Roger McIntyre, a psychopharmacologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. And some researchers are testing whether, by influencing reward-related brain circuits, the drugs might help with dementia and depression as well.

Obesity drugs aren't always forever. What happens when you quit?

The research is still in its early stages, scientists warn. “We first need to find out if it's efficacious and safe,” says W. Kyle Simmons, a neuroimaging specialist at Oklahoma State University in Tulsa, who is leading a GLP-1 trial for alcohol reduction.

But some researchers and physicians are excited. No truly new class of addiction medicine has won approval from regulators in decades, says Elisabet Jerlhag Holm, an addiction biologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. If GLP-1 drugs prove effective in bigger trials, she says, “it's a revolution”.

It took some years for the current buzz around GLP-1 drugs in addiction medicine to build. Researchers originally developed them to control blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes by mimicking the hormone GLP-1. Soon it became clear that the drugs could curb appetite and promote weight loss, too. They act on hormone receptors located in the pancreas and gut — where they help to regulate blood sugar and signal fullness — but also in key regions of the brain that control reward and motivation, dialling down the urge for tasty, calorie-laden food.

By the early 2010s, Jerlhag Holm was wondering whether the drugs could blunt other urges. She published a trio of papers showing that they could dampen cravings in rats and mice hooked on alcohol2, nicotine3 and stimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine4. Her team also showed5 that GLP-1 therapy could reduce animal behaviours that resemble relapse, which is when people return to drugs after a period of abstinence.

Yet her findings barely registered among addiction researchers, she says, and pharmaceutical companies showed no interest either. “I was quite alone for a long time,” says Jerlhag Holm.

But Lorenzo Leggio, a physician-scientist at the US National Institutes of Health in Baltimore, Maryland, noticed the work. He had also been following clues that GLP-1 might influence addictive behaviour and, in 2015, joined forces with Jerlhag Holm to uncover the first evidence of a connection between the hormone and alcohol dependence in humans. The team found that a common variant of the GLP-1 receptor gene was linked to heavier drinking6.

Using post-mortem human brain tissue, Leggio's lab later showed that people with alcohol-use disorder have elevated levels of GLP-1 receptors in key reward-related regions of the brain7. Leggio suspects that this reflects an adaptive response: alcohol dampens the body's GLP-1 production, and so the brain boosts expression of the hormone's receptors to preserve sensitivity to it in circuits that govern reward and motivation.

These results, together with a growing number of animal studies, solidified GLP-1's connection to addictive behaviour. Yet it was not until May 2023 that the story spilled into the public eye. The Atlantic magazine published an article about people taking semaglutide who said their urge to smoke or drink had faded. ‘Did Scientists Accidentally Invent an Anti-addiction Drug?' it was headlined. “That was definitely a turning point,” says Leggio, who suddenly found himself getting calls from journalists.

The first few rigorous trials, however, had largely disappointing results. A 2022 study in Denmark, led by psychiatrist Anders Fink-Jensen at the University of Copenhagen, found that weekly treatment with exenatide — a ‘first-generation' GLP-1 compound used since 2005 to treat diabetes but never approved for weight loss — did not substantially reduce the number of heavy drinking days in people diagnosed with alcohol dependence8. A 2023 trial in Switzerland likewise found that dulaglutide, another older GLP-1 drug, did not help people to quit smoking9.

But other results suggested that the drugs might have an effect. In a trial10 involving 20 people with opioid-use disorder, led by Grigson and psychologist Scott Bunce, also at Pennsylvania State University, treatment with liraglutide — another first-generation GLP-1 drug — reduced opioid craving by roughly 40%. And when Fink-Jensen's team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at the brains of people taking exenatide in their clinical trial, they saw muted activity in reward-related regions when the participants viewed images of alcoholic drinks8.

But the first-generation drugs tested in these preliminary studies are much less potent than agents such as semaglutide or tirzepatide. These second-generation compounds bind more tightly to the GLP-1 receptor, stay active in the body for longer and have shown greater benefits across a range of health conditions. So, could these latest drugs change the behaviour of people struggling with substance misuse?

That's what researchers are now examining in a raft of clinical trials with hotly anticipated results. Fink-Jensen and his colleagues have already tested whether the high dose of semaglutide approved for weight loss can cut alcohol intake in 108 people with alcohol-use disorder and obesity, in a clinical trial that wrapped up earlier this year. He says the results should be published in early 2026.

In the United States, meanwhile, Leggio and Simmons are each leading independent but coordinated randomized trials testing injected semaglutide in moderate-to-heavy drinkers who meet the diagnostic criteria for problematic alcohol use. Leggio's trial will involve 52 people and test the high-dose Wegovy form of the drug, whereas Simmons's trial, involving 80 people, is testing the lower-dose Ozempic, typically prescribed for diabetes. And psychologist Joseph Schacht at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora has been running his own alcohol trial with the oral version of semaglutide (marketed as Rybelsus). By coordinating their efforts, the three teams hope to tease apart how differences in dose and delivery affect outcomes.

Schacht says that the pills, although less potent than injections, could be more appealing to people with alcohol addiction, many of whom also have a history of using injectable drugs such as fentanyl. “They can be gun-shy around needles, because that is a cue related to injection drug use,” he says.

In all of these trials of semaglutide for alcohol dependence, the research teams are also using fMRI to capture before-and-after snapshots of the brain to show how the drug alters responses to alcohol-related prompts, such as drinks or photos. This could reveal whether and how the drug disrupts the brain's drive for alcohol — the reward-seeking sense of ‘wanting' that fuels addiction. The imaging results might also show brain activity patterns that are more common in people who benefit from GLP-1 therapy than in those who don't. “It may give us a better understanding for whom the drug works best,” Simmons says.

Researchers are already piecing together a picture of how GLP-1 drugs act on the brain's reward system. They know from animal models that rewarding substances — alcohol, nicotine, opioids, food — activate similar neural circuitry. This links deep brain structures such as the ventral tegmental area, where neurons that synthesize the neurotransmitter dopamine originate, to the nucleus accumbens, where dopamine signals arrive and register as pleasure. Normally, every sip, puff or hit sends a jolt of rewarding dopamine through this circuit, teaching the brain to want more and reinforcing addictive behaviour.

GLP-1 receptors sit on neurons throughout this network and, when triggered, are thought to reduce the flow of dopamine and other chemical messages to make rewarding experiences feel less compelling. When drugs such as semaglutide mimic GLP-1, they blunt the dopamine response and the compulsion to repeat the addictive behaviour fades away.

Stress responses come into play as well, animal studies show. When drugs activate GLP-1 receptors in brain regions such as the amygdala, they help to mute the surge of stress hormones that accompany anxiety, withdrawal and craving. This dual action — calming both the urge and the unease — could help to explain why the therapies seem to reduce not only consumption but also relapse, at least in rodents.

The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) influences Southern Hemisphere temperature and precipitation, ocean circulation, carbon cycling and the Antarctic cryosphere. In this Review, we examine the dynamics, projections and effects of the SAM, focusing on future implications for the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. The SAM is the leading mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics, associated with variations in the mid-latitude westerly jet strength and position. The SAM is primarily an internally driven atmospheric process, for which anomalies dissipate in 1–2 weeks; however, sustained SAM anomalies can also be forced by stratospheric processes and tropical Pacific variability. Ozone depletion during the 1970s–1990s contributed to large positive trends in austral summer. The SAM is now in its most positive mean state in over 1,000 years, and a year-round positive trend in the SAM is projected to continue throughout the twenty-first century in response to increasing greenhouse gases. Given the importance of SAM effects on Southern Ocean circulation, carbon cycling, and Antarctic ice mass balance for future climate and sea level rise projections, it is crucial that the effects of SAM are better modelled and understood, including accounting for the influence of the shifting seasonality of positive SAM trends and its increasing asymmetry.

Deliveries of organic molecules from space, such as those found in carbonaceous meteorites, have long been hypothesized as a source of the inventory of the first life on Earth. This hypothesis is strengthened by detections of two of life's fundamental building blocks—nucleobases and protein-building amino acids—in pristine samples returned by spacecraft from the carbonaceous asteroids Bennu and Ryugu. However, life also requires sugars, which cannot be searched for in Ryugu samples due to limited available mass, and their presence in some meteorites is equivocal owing to terrestrial exposure. Here we analyse an extract from a sample of asteroid (101955) Bennu collected by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft and identify several bio-essential sugars, including ribose (RNA sugar) and glucose (metabolism substrate). These sugars complete the inventory of ingredients crucial to life. Their distribution is consistent with that in the condensation products of formaldehyde solution. Given that Bennu contains formaldehyde and originates from an ancient parent asteroid that underwent long-term alteration by aqueous fluids, we postulate that the detected sugars formed in the parent asteroid from brines containing formaldehyde. This indicates that material with all three components necessary to life could have been dispersed to prebiotic Earth and other inner planets.

Ribose and 2-deoxyribose are key sugar constituents of nucleic acids in terrestrial biology (RNA and DNA), which record genetic information and translate it to form proteins that work as the primary catalyst for most biological reactions. Ribose is regarded as a particularly important molecule for the origin of life because RNA may have been a crucial step in the early evolution of life as gene carriers and enzymes1,2,3. Glucose, a sugar molecule, is a ubiquitous energy source and critical component of catabolic pathways, notably glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the Entner–Doudoroff pathway. Because glycolysis is the common catabolic pathway for nearly all organisms, including aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, it is regarded as a primitive catabolic pathway4. Thus, the origins and distributions of these sugars in extraterrestrial materials have been investigated to understand the potential for extraterrestrial habitability and exogenous contributions to the early Earth's prebiotic organic inventory that led to the emergence of life5,6,7.

Meteorites contain diverse organic compounds, including the building blocks of life, such as amino acids, nucleobases, sugars and related compounds6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Dihydroxyacetone, a triose (three-carbon sugar), was found in the Mighei-type (CM) carbonaceous chondrites Murchison and Murray6. Ribose and other pentoses (five-carbon sugars) were found in Murchison and the Renazzo-type (CR) carbonaceous chondrite NWA 8017. Although the carbon isotope compositions of the ribose and pentoses in Murchison and NWA 801 indicate an extraterrestrial origin7, meteorites experience uncontrolled exposure to the biosphere and terrestrial weathering before collection, and they usually have unknown solar system origin. In addition, because terrestrial organisms can grow on meteorites13, if such organisms selectively use 13C-enriched molecules among many others, the heavy carbon isotopic compositions of sugars and other organic molecules previously measured in meteorites may not be proof of an entirely extraterrestrial source.

The OSIRIS-REx mission delivered 121.6 g of regolith (unconsolidated granular material) collected from Bennu to Earth on 24 September 2023, under carefully controlled conditions14. The samples were curated under high-purity N2 at NASA's Johnson Space Center15. Early studies showed that Bennu has similar mineralogical and elemental characteristics to Ivuna-type (CI) carbonaceous chondrites; is enriched in carbon and nitrogen compared to most meteorites, but resembles ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites; and experienced extensive aqueous alteration14,16. The Bennu samples analysed to date contain soluble organic compounds, including amino acids, amines, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, nucleobases, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and a diverse mixture of soluble molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur17. We took advantage of this pristine asteroidal material to search for extraterrestrial bio-essential sugars.

Using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and GC–tandem MS (GC-MS/MS), we searched for sugars in an acid and water extract of a 603.4-mg aliquot (sample ID OREX-800107-108) of homogenized powder made from crushing an aggregate (unsorted) Bennu sample (OREX-800107-0; Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1). The acid extraction was conducted to avoid potential sugar formation and degradation because these reactions are limited in low pH18,19,20.

The Bennu extract shows several identical GC-MS/MS peaks to the investigated sugars in all the characteristic fragment masses of the derivatized sugars (Figs. 1 and 2 and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3). We detected all four aldopentoses—ribose, lyxose, xylose and arabinose—and two aldohexoses, glucose and galactose (Fig. 3a). These identifications were confirmed using a different GC-MS system and a different separation column (Extended Data Figs. 4–6). The abundances of ribose, lyxose, arabinose and xylose were 0.097 ± 0.014, 0.018 ± 0.007, 0.11 ± 0.03 and 0.079 ± 0.033 nmol g−1, respectively (Table 1). Glucose had the highest concentration of the sugars at 0.35 ± 0.05 nmol g−1, whereas galactose was 0.014 ± 0.004 nmol g−1 (Table 1).

The co-eluting compounds least influenced the mass transition of m/z 242 to 140. Signal Int., signal intensity; STD, standard.

a, Identified sugars. b, Relative abundances of pentoses in Bennu and formose-type reaction products. Formose-type reaction product (1) is from formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde in an alkaline solution for 360 min (ref. 7) and (2) is from the reaction of formaldehyde with olivine in a neutral solution for 7 days (FO7)23. c, Abundances of pentoses in the Bennu sample and meteorites7. Data for the Bennu sugars present mean values ± standard deviation in triplicate measurements. The analytical errors for the meteorites were not reported7.

The characteristic fragment masses of hexoses also have peaks indicative of the two other hexoses (mannose and altrose), but these identifications are not definitive. Thus, we do not assert the detection of these sugars and only report their upper limits: mannose, <0.05 nmol g−1; altrose, <0.1 nmol g−1.

Small amounts of sugar alcohols, xylitol (0.005 nmol g−1) and arabitol (0.002 nmol g−1), were also detected (Extended Data Fig. 7). We also searched for other sugars and related compounds, including sugar acids that have previously been reported in meteorites6,21: 2-deoxyribose, threose, erythrose, ribulose, xylulose and branched aldopentoses ((2 R,3S)-2,3,4-trihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)butanal and (2S,3S)-2,3,4-trihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)butanal) (Table 1). All of them were below the analytical detection limit.

We considered the possibility that contamination by biological organic compounds could have affected our findings. Contamination is a well-documented challenge in meteoritics because even well-preserved and well-handled meteorites were exposed to uncontrolled terrestrial environments before collection. However, the returned samples of Bennu have not experienced such exposure. The chiral amino acids in a recently analysed Bennu aggregate sample were racemic (d = l) or nearly so17, indicating no measurable biological contamination, which would have resulted in a higher abundance of l- relative to d-amino acids. Furthermore, the SiO2 procedural blank (Methods) is free from sugar contamination (Figs. 1 and 2), confirming that the Bennu sample was not contaminated during analytical processing.

The abundances of the biologically important sugars in the Bennu sample (glucose, arabinose, ribose and xylose) might nevertheless suggest the possibility of contamination. However, glucose, arabinose and xylose are relatively stable18,19. The higher thermal stability and lower reactivity of glucose among the aldoses, characterized by a more than one order of magnitude lower reaction rate than that of ribose, is particularly compelling. Thus, the relatively high abundances of these sugars in the Bennu sample are reasonable.

Ribose, though, is not a chemically stable sugar. The reason for its relatively high abundance in the Bennu sample is not immediately apparent, but laboratory simulations of interstellar and asteroidal sugar synthesis22,23 have shown ribose as one of the abundant pentoses, similar to arabinose and xylose. Thus, the observed abundances in the Bennu sample are not inconsistent with abiotic synthesis (Fig. 3b).

The higher abundance of larger sugars compared to smaller sugars, such as hexoses compared to tetroses, is the inverse of the typical distribution of soluble organic compounds, including amino acids, carboxylic acids and amines, in meteorites and other asteroid samples10,17,24,25. However, the higher abundance of larger sugars in Bennu is consistent with a transient state of sugar-forming reactions seen in laboratory experiments of aldehyde reactions, including a reaction simulating asteroidal environments, in which larger sugars form by successively consuming smaller sugars23.

The total abundance of the detected sugars (0.668 nmol g−1) is about 1 mol% of the total abundance of amino acids measured previously in Bennu samples (70 nmol g−1) (ref. 17). Given the low abundances of sugars, high abundances of interfering molecules and sample mass available for this study, stable isotopic and enantiomeric measurements of the sugars were not possible.

We also analysed the pH of hot-water extracts of homogenized Bennu powder (OREX-800107-106) and carbonaceous meteorites (Murchison, Murray and the CI Orgueil) to estimate the parent body pH conditions (Table 2). The pH values we found for Bennu (pH 8.23 ± 0.02) are higher than that of a hot-water extract of Ryugu (pH 3.95–4.19) in which many sulfate and organo-sulfates were contained26. The implied alkaline pH for Bennu's parent body is consistent with the observation of evaporite minerals16 and the detection of NH3-bearing fluid inclusions27 in other Bennu samples.

Bennu's large D and 15N enrichments14,17 indicate that its parent body accreted ices and organic matter from a reservoir(s) in the early outer solar system17. Laboratory simulations of ultraviolet and cosmic ray irradiation of an interstellar ice analogue made from methanol and water suggests that sugars, including ribose with larger amounts of smaller sugars such as glyceraldehyde, could have formed in the interstellar medium and the cold outer solar system, before asteroid accretion22,28,29. Formose-type reactions, in which formaldehyde reacts successively to form larger sugars via smaller sugars, have previously been proposed as a possible formation mechanism for sugars in asteroids and in the interstellar medium7,22,23,30. Aldehydes, the source materials of the formose reaction, have been found in interstellar space, comets, many carbonaceous meteorites and Bennu samples17,31,32,33. Aldehydes and small sugars can react with each other to form diverse larger sugars, including those found in Bennu, through the formose reaction in weakly acidic to alkaline fluids, as shown in laboratory simulations7,23,30,34. Veins of potential carbonates in boulders on Bennu observed by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft indicate a history of large-scale fluid activity35, and evaporites in Bennu samples point to past alkaline fluids rich in sodium, magnesium and calcium carbonate16. Calcium and magnesium ions are effective catalysts for sugar synthesis through the formose reaction34,36,37,38. Also, abundant phyllosilicate minerals in the Bennu samples are evidence of microscale ancient aqueous activity14. This geologic history, together with the weakly alkaline pH we measured (8.23 ± 0.02), suggests the plausibility of sugar synthesis through the formose reaction during aqueous processing in Bennu's parent body.

The formose reaction is followed by several side reactions, including the synthesis of sugar acids and sugar alcohols, and the rearrangements between branched and linear sugars and aldoses and ketoses37,38,39,40. Sugar alcohols and sugar acids have been detected in some carbonaceous meteorites6,21. These compounds are generally formed through disproportionation of sugars via the Cannizzaro and cross-Cannizzaro reactions under highly alkaline solutions. Our detection of small amounts of sugar alcohols in the Bennu sample suggests that these side reactions may have occurred to a limited extent, although they probably did not dominate the prebiotic chemistry. Catalysts for the formose reaction, such as Ca2+, generally direct aldehydes toward sugar synthesis and suppress the Cannizzaro reaction38,39. Bennu's mineralogy14,35 supports the presence of dissolved divalent cations (that is, Mg and Ca) in aqueous fluids on the parent asteroid.

Experimental studies of the formose reaction under short durations at room temperature have shown that the products contain abundant ketoses and branched sugars34,40, neither of which were detected in the Bennu sample. In contrast, longer-duration reactions at elevated temperatures, particularly with Ca2+ as a catalyst, favour the formation of linear aldopentoses over ketoses and branched sugars34. These findings highlight that the distribution of sugars in the formose reaction is highly sensitive to fluid chemistry and reaction duration38. Thus, further investigation is needed to constrain the specific reaction mechanisms and environmental conditions that led to the formation of asteroidal sugars.

The total abundance of pentoses we detected in the Bennu sample (0.36 nmol g−1) is comparatively low, about 16% of that in the Murchison meteorite (2.2 nmol g−1) (ref. 7) (Table 1 and Fig. 3c). A possible reason for this could be the relatively abundant ammonia in Bennu17: ammonia can react with aldehydes, including sugars, yielding a Schiff base, which could be converted into other molecules such as amino acids, amines and nitrogen heterocycles41,42,43,44,45. However, these compounds are also less abundant in Bennu samples17—about 30–50% of those in Murchison—suggesting additional reasons for the lower abundance of sugars.

The slightly more alkaline pH of the Bennu extract compared with carbonaceous meteorites (Table 2) could be related to Bennu's ammonia enrichment and might indicate that the reactions between sugars and aldehydes progressed faster in Bennu's parent asteroid, because alkaline pH substantially promotes these reactions34. Abundant evaporites, phyllosilicates and carbonates in the Bennu samples14,16 record more substantial aqueous processes in the parent asteroid of Bennu than that of Murchison. Thus, the progress of the reactions between sugars and aldehydes is a more probable reason for the lower abundance of sugars in Bennu. Because successive formaldehyde addition to existing small sugars forms new, larger sugars, pentoses and hexoses that existed before the asteroidal aqueous processing were most likely consumed in the reactions. We therefore propose that the detected Bennu sugars were formed by asteroidal processes acting on interstellar materials, rather than having been formed in interstellar environments and surviving the reactive asteroidal processes.

We did not find the DNA sugar, 2-deoxyribose, in the Bennu sample we analysed. 2-Deoxyribose and deoxy sugar derivatives were reported in a laboratory photochemical reaction in methanol-containing ice28 and a laboratory formose reaction23. The 2-deoxyribose has more than two orders of magnitude higher chemical reactivity than sugars detected in the Bennu sample19, yet this molecule has lower sensitivity to thermal decomposition, by a factor of 2.6, than ribose18. Thus, if 2-deoxyribose was formed before asteroid accretion and/or within the parent asteroid, the subsequent aqueous reactions most likely consumed this sugar by the reactions with other molecules. The high reactivity of 2-deoxyribose is also consistent with the limited formation of this sugar in a thermally driven formose reaction23.

All five of the canonical nucleobases in DNA and RNA, and phosphate, were previously found in Bennu samples14,17. Our detection of ribose means that all the components of RNA are present in Bennu. The detection of ribose and non-detection of 2-deoxyribose further indicates that ribose may be much more prevalent than 2-deoxyribose in B-type carbonaceous asteroids. The RNA world hypothesis proposes that RNA was the first informational and catalytic polymer that led to the origin of life; later, the system was replaced by DNA and proteins through biological evolution1,2,3. This hypothesis is supported by the chemical and biological functions of RNA in life. The higher availability of ribose over 2-deoxyribose in a primitive asteroid provides additional support.

Hexoses were reported in meteorites in the 1960s46,47. However, these detections were highly uncertain given analytical issues and possible contamination, characterized by the highest abundance of sugars detected in an ordinary chondrite that is now known to contain almost no polar soluble organic compounds47. Hexoses have not been reported in any other extraterrestrial materials. Our confident detection in Bennu of abundant glucose—the hexose molecule that is life's common energy source—and other hexoses indicates that they were present in the early solar system. Given that the fragments of carbonaceous asteroids appear to be widely distributed in the inner solar system, such asteroids or fragments of asteroids (for example, carbonaceous chondrites), would have provided glucose and other bio-essential sugars to broad areas of the inner solar system, together with nucleobases and protein-building amino acids17,24,25,48. Thus, all three crucial building blocks of life would have reached the prebiotic Earth and other potentially habitable planets.

The physical homogeneity of the powdered Bennu aliquot (OREX-800107-108; 603.4 mg) was verified by X-ray computed tomography50. The negligible effects of X-rays on sugars during the X-ray computed tomography imaging were previously verified using the Murchison meteorite51. All the extraction and purification steps were conducted in an ISO Class-5 clean bench. Sugars in the powdered Bennu aliquot were extracted into 15 ml of 2% HCl (TAMAPURE-AA10, Tama Chemicals) in a glass test tube with sonication for 30 min under a temperature less than 25 °C. The supernatant of the centrifuged solution was collected (480 × g, 45 min at 10 °C). This process was conducted five times. Sugars in the residue were further extracted with 15 ml water (TAMAPURE-AA, Tama Chemicals) three times. The supernatant was added to the HCl extract. All of the extract was evaporated under a vacuum with a rotary evaporator. Sugars in the residue were extracted into 10 ml of methanol five times (Q-Tof grade, Wako Pure Chemicals), and the methanol was removed under a vacuum with the rotary evaporator. The cation in the residue was removed with 40 ml of a cation exchange resin (AG50-X8 200–400 mesh, Bio-Rad). The resin was washed with 10% NH4OH (ultrapure grade, KANTO Chemical), 1 mol l−1 NaOH (ultrapure grade, KANTO Chemical), 1 mol l−1 HCl (TAMAPURE-AA, Tama Chemicals) and water (TAMAPURE-AA, Tama Chemicals) before the sample load. The sugar fraction was collected by washing the resin with 100 ml water. The resin with cations was further used for nucleobase analysis. The sugar fraction was dried under a vacuum. Ten percent of this fraction was used for nucleobase analysis. The other 90% was combined with an internal standard (2-deoxy-fluoro-glucose) and derivatized into aldonitrile acetate. A similar mass of silica powder from a thermally treated (500 °C overnight) synthetic SiO2 (600 mg; Isomass Analytics, 0.85–1.7 mm diameter chips) was used as the procedural blank material to assess the potential for contamination of the Bennu sample during sample powdering, extraction, derivatization and analysis. We used a well-characterized silica material as a control rather than a phyllosilicate mineral (such as serpentine found in Bennu) because SiO2 is stable at the 500 °C bakeout temperature used. Moreover, the synthetic SiO2 used is distinct from any minerals in Bennu, therefore any cross-contamination of particles that occurred during sample processing (note that the SiO2 and Bennu aggregate material were crushed in different quartz mortar and pestle sets on separate days to minimize this possibility) could be readily identified in the Bennu sample and the SiO2 control. The derivatization was reported elsewhere7. All sample handling was conducted with glassware thermally cleaned at 500 °C in air for 6 h before use.

The derivatized sample was dissolved in 100 μl of 50% hexane and 50% ethyl acetate. The identification of sugars was conducted with GC-MS/MS (GCMS-TQ8040, SHIMADZU) and GC-MS (5977B, Agilent) using two different separation columns (DB-17 ms and DB-5 ms, Agilent). For the GC-MS/MS, 5 μl of the sample was injected into the inlet at 250 °C with splitless mode. The temperatures of the transfer line and the ion source were 250 and 200 °C, respectively. For the GC-MS, 5 μl of the sample was injected into the inlet (CIS4, GERSTEL) with solvent vent mode of Programmable Temperature Vaporization. The Programmable Temperature Vaporization inlet was initially at 10 °C for 1 min, followed by the ramp up at 12 °C s−1 to 300 °C and kept for 10 min. The temperatures of the transfer line, ion source and quadrupole were 300, 230 and 150 °C, respectively. The separation with the DB-17ms column (60-m length, 0.25-mm inner diameter, 0.25-μm film thick) was conducted with a He column flow rate of 0.8 ml min−1. The column oven, initially at 50 °C for 2 min, was ramped up to 122 °C at the rate of 15 °C min−1, kept for 5 min, ramped up to 160 °C at the rate of 5 °C min−1, ramped up to 195 °C at the rate of 3 °C/ min−1, kept for 15 min and finally ramped up to 270 °C at the rate of 1.5 °C min−1. The separation with the DB-5 ms column (30-m length, 0.25-mm inner diameter, 0.25-μm film thick) was conducted with a total He flow rate of 18.2 ml min−1 and a column flow rate of 1.2 ml min−1. The column oven, initially at 50 °C, was ramped up to 100 °C at the rate of 10 °C min−1, 170 °C at the rate of 3 °C min−1, 220 °C at the rate of 1.5 °C min−1 and 300 °C for 10 min at the rate of 40 °C min−1. The retention time was calibrated with the internal standard. The quantification of the detected sugars was conducted using the same external standard and an internal standard (2-deoxy-fluoro-glucose). All these sugars were absent in the procedural blank (Figs. 1 and 2 and Extended Data Figs. 4–6).

We investigated the mass chromatograms of characteristic fragment ions of target sugars at the calibrated retention times corresponding to the sugars. Several fragment chromatograms are disturbed by co-eluting compounds. We identified the compounds based on the following criteria: (1) each of the five key fragments has a peak at the same retention times corresponding to pentose standards and each of the six fragments for the hexose standards, (2) the relative abundance of the fragments are also consistent with the standard, considering the interference by partly overlapping near peaks and background increase for specific chromatograms. When one of the chromatograms has a retention time that differs by more than 0.05 min, we exclude the identification. The abundance was calculated based on a peak area among the key fragment multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) chromatograms (that is, mass transitions of m/z 242 > 140 for pentoses and m/z 121 > 152 for hexoses. These fragment chromatograms have not been interfered with by co-eluting peaks. The peak identification was further confirmed by the analysis of a spiked sample with standards. The spiking experiment was conducted using the original Bennu sample and standard, approximately ten months after the extraction and derivatization. The sample and the standard were dried and stored at −80 °C until the second analysis. Although the peak intensity was reduced to approximately 50% from the original analysis, peaks still have sufficient intensities (Extended Data Fig. 8).

We performed the hot-water extraction based on a previously published method (105 °C, 20 h) (ref. 24). Then, we conducted small-scale pH measurements ( <7 μl) of the hot-water extract (49.7 mg of OREX-800107-106) at 21.5 °C (within ± 0.1 °C in ambient atmosphere) by using a LAQUA F-73 instrument (HORIBA Advanced Techno Co. Ltd.) with a pH electrode (model 0040-10D), as reported in a previous study26. A three-point calibration was performed with phosphate standard solutions of pH 4.01 and 6.86 (certificate) and a tetraborate standard solution of pH 9.18 (Kanto Chemical Co. Inc.). All pH measurement scans were statically performed at least 200 times for each measurement (~1 Hz) (Extended Data Fig. 9). We also represent the pH measurement of the procedure blank with 49.1 mg of SiO2. We also measured the pH profiles for similar extracts of representative carbonaceous meteorites (that is, Murchison, Murray and Orgueil) as references. The Murchison extract was prepared by ref. 24, and the extracts of Murray and Orgueil were prepared by ref. 49.

Piperidine and pyridine are nitrogen heterocyclic motifs prominently used in pharmaceuticals and consequently of great importance. The direct reduction of planar pyridines into piperidines with high sp3-carbon content is highly attractive as this offers a route to producing high-value products and broadening the structural space. However, direct hydrogenation of pyridines with homogeneous catalysts is challenging due to their aromatic stability and catalyst-poisoning abilities. Here we describe a robust and selective iridium(III)-catalysed ionic hydrogenation of pyridines to corresponding functionalized piperidines. Important highly reduction-sensitive groups, including nitro, azido, bromo, alkenyl and alkynyl, are inert, enabling access to a broad range of multisubstituted piperidines in high yields, substantially expanding the available chemical space for this relevant scaffold. The method requires low catalyst loadings, is scalable to decagrams and delivers the most synthetically valuable free secondary amines as easily isolable and stable piperidinium salts. Applied in a complex late-stage setting, the pyridine motif in several FDA-approved drugs was successfully and selectively hydrogenated.

Retrons are prokaryotic genetic elements involved in anti-phage defense and consist of a non-coding RNA, a reverse transcriptase (RT), and various effector proteins. Retron-Eco7 (previously known as Retron-Ec78) from Escherichia coli encodes two effector proteins (the PtuA ATPase and the PtuB nuclease) and degrades the host tRNATyr upon phage infection, thereby protecting host cells against invading phages. However, its defense mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the Retron-Eco7 complex, comprising the RT, multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA), PtuA, and PtuB. The Retron-Eco7 structures reveal that the RT–msDNA complex associates with two PtuA–PtuB complexes, potentially inhibiting their nuclease activity and suppressing bacterial growth arrest prior to phage infection. Furthermore, the phage-encoded D15 nuclease acts as a trigger for the Retron-Eco7 system and cleaves the msDNA bound to the complex, facilitating the dissociation of PtuA–PtuB from RT–msDNA. Our data indicate that msDNA cleavage by D15 is the initial step required for the specific cleavage of the host tRNATyr by the PtuA–PtuB nuclease, which leads to abortive infection. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insights into the Retron-Eco7 system and highlights the diversity of prokaryotic anti-phage defense mechanisms.

Prokaryotes have evolved a variety of defense mechanisms to combat foreign nucleic acids, such as phages and plasmids1,2,3,4. Some of these systems, including restriction-modification systems and CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems, directly target and eliminate invading nucleic acids5,6. In contrast, abortive infection systems induce cell dormancy or death upon infection, thereby preventing phage propagation and protecting the cell population7.

Retrons are prokaryotic genetic elements consisting of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA), a reverse transcriptase (RT), and diverse effector proteins, and are classified into 13 types based on the type of effector proteins8,9. The ncRNA contains msr and msd regions (hereafter referred to as msrRNA and msdRNA, respectively), with two inverted repeat regions (a1 in the msrRNA and a2 in the msdRNA)10 (Fig. 1a). The RT enzyme recognizes the a1 and a2 regions and reverse-transcribes complementary DNA from the 2′-OH group of the conserved guanosine residue (branching G) in the msrRNA, using the msdRNA as the template8,11 (Fig. 1a, b). Subsequently, the msdRNA is degraded by RNase H1, producing a unique RNA–DNA hybrid with a 2′-5′ covalent linkage (known as multi-copy single-stranded DNA (msDNA))11,12,13. Retron systems have been harnessed for genome engineering technologies, due to their ability to produce high copy numbers of DNA with customizable sequences8,14,15,16,17.

The first retron was discovered in 198410, but its biological functions have remained elusive for decades. However, recent studies revealed that retron elements function as toxin-antitoxin systems, with the RT–msDNA complex acting as the antitoxin and its cognate effector protein as the toxin, thus protecting bacterial cells against phage infections through diverse mechanisms18,19,20. In addition, recent studies of Retron-Eco1 (also known as Retron-Ec86) revealed that the RT–msDNA complex associates with its N-glycosidase effector to form a filament capable of hydrolyzing NAD(P)+, thereby providing mechanistic insights into Retron-Eco1-mediated anti-phage defense21,22,23. Retron-Eco7 (also known as Retron-Ec78) comprises an RT, a 144-nucleotide (nt) ncRNA, and two effector proteins, PtuA (the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family ATPase) and PtuB (the HNH nuclease)18,19,24 (Fig. 1c). Recently, we reported that the Retron-Eco7 system cleaves the host tRNATyr and participates in anti-phage defense, which is inhibited by a phage-encoded tRNA25. However, the action mechanism of Retron-Eco7 remains unknown.

In this study, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the Retron-Eco7 complex, consisting of one RT–msDNA complex and two PtuA–PtuB complexes. Our structural and functional data indicate that RT–msDNA associates with PtuA–PtuB, thereby suppressing bacterial growth arrest prior to phage infection. We further found that the phage-encoded D15 nuclease cleaves the msDNA within the Retron-Eco7 complex, facilitating the dissociation of PtuA–PtuB, which leads to host tRNATyr cleavage and ultimately abortive infection. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into anti-phage defense by Retron-Eco7 and highlight the mechanistic diversity of prokaryotic defense systems.

To investigate the defense activity of Retron-Eco7, we expressed the Retron-Eco7 system, comprising the RT, the ncRNA, PtuA, and PtuB, in Escherichia coli (Fig. 1c). We then infected the bacterial cells with either T-series phages (T1–T7), the SP15 phage, which is highly similar to the wild-type (WT) T5 phage, or the mutant SP15 phage (SP15m), which lacks the anti-defense protein Rad and tRNATyr (SP-tRNATyr)25 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Using spot assays, we subsequently examined the defense activity of Retron-Eco7 against these phages. Consistent with our recent study25, Retron-Eco7 protected E. coli against T5 and SP15m, but not SP15 (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1b). Mutations of the putative catalytic residues in the PtuA ATPase (D395A) and the PtuB HNH nuclease (H57A) abolished the defense activity (Fig. 1d), suggesting that the enzymatic activities of both PtuA (ATPase) and PtuB (nuclease) are essential for Retron-Eco7-mediated anti-phage defense. Next, we monitored the growth of E. coli cells containing Retron-Eco7 after infection with SP15m. The expression of PtuA and PtuB, but not Retron-Eco7 (RT–ncRNA–PtuA–PtuB), inhibited bacterial growth without phage infection (Fig. 1e), suggesting that PtuA–PtuB and RT–msDNA function as a toxin and an antitoxin, respectively. A mutation in either PtuA (D395A) or PtuB (H57A) abolished the toxicity of PtuA–PtuB (Fig. 1e), indicating that the enzymatic activities of both PtuA and PtuB are crucial for growth inhibition. E. coli cells containing Retron-Eco7 exhibited normal growth under low multiplicity of infection (MOI) conditions, whereas their growth was inhibited under high MOI conditions (Fig. 1f). Collectively, these results indicate that Retron-Eco7 protects E. coli against phage infection through an abortive infection mechanism.

To explore the defense mechanism of Retron-Eco7, we initially examined whether its defense activity is affected by the addition of affinity tags to the Retron-Eco7 components. We confirmed that the Retron-Eco7 system, comprising the ncRNA, His6-tagged RT, PtuA, and Twin-Strep-tagged PtuB, exhibits comparable activity to that of the untagged system (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). Thus, we co-expressed the tagged Retron-Eco7 system in E. coli, isolated the complex using Strep-Tactin resin, and further purified it by size-exclusion chromatography (Supplementary Fig. 2a). SDS-PAGE and urea-PAGE analyses of the peak fraction eluted from the size-exclusion column revealed that the complex comprises the RT, PtuA, PtuB, and the msDNA (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Our analysis confirmed that the msDNA is an RNA–DNA hybrid consisting of a ~ 40-nt msrRNA and an ~80-nt msdDNA (Supplementary Fig. 2a), indicating that the msdRNA region in the ncRNA was reverse-transcribed by the RT to produce the msdDNA, which was then processed in E. coli, as previously described24,26.

We determined the cryo-EM structures of the RT–msDNA–PtuA–PtuB complex (referred to as the Retron-Eco7 complex) in five distinct states (states 1–5) at 2.6–2.8-Å resolutions (Fig. 1g, h, Supplementary Figs. 2b–g and 3a, b, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Movie 1). The cryo-EM structure revealed that the Retron-Eco7 complex consists of an RT molecule, an msDNA molecule, four PtuA molecules (PtuA.1–PtuA.4), and two PtuB molecules (PtuB.1 and PtuB.2), except for state 5, which contains an additional RT–msDNA complex (RT.2 and msDNA.2) (Fig. 1g, h and Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). PtuA.1 and PtuA.3 interact with PtuA.2 and PtuA.4, respectively, to form dimers, which in turn interact with PtuB.1 and PtuB.2, respectively. Both the msrRNA and msdDNA regions of the msDNA are recognized by the RT, while the msdDNA region is sandwiched by the two PtuA dimers. PtuA.1 and PtuA.2 interact with PtuA.4 and PtuA.3 via their coiled-coil domains, respectively, forming a tetrameric assembly surrounding the msdDNA. PtuA.1 also interacts with the RT and the msrRNA.

Since the C-terminal domain of a PtuB molecule is sandwiched between the C-terminal domains of two PtuA molecules, the PtuB molecules (PtuB.1 and PtuB.2) can bind to the PtuA dimers (PtuA.1–PtuA.2 and PtuA.3–PtuA.4) in two distinct orientations (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Consequently, states 1–4 are structurally similar, except for the orientations of PtuB relative to the PtuA dimers. In state 5, RT.2 interacts with PtuA.4, msDNA.1, and msDNA.2 (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e). Similar to states 1–4, the DNA region of msDNA.1 is recognized by the two PtuA dimers, while the corresponding region of msDNA.2 is largely disordered and forms only a few contacts with the proteins, suggesting that a single RT–msDNA module is sufficient for the assembly of the Retron-Eco7 complex. Since the structures in states 1–5 are essentially similar and likely functionally relevant, we focus on the structure of state 1 unless otherwise stated. Overall, our cryo-EM analysis shows that the RT–msDNA complex binds to the two PtuA–PtuB complexes primarily through interactions between the msDNA and the PtuA dimers.

The Retron-Eco7 ncRNA comprises the msrRNA and the msdRNA, with the 5′ region of the msrRNA (a1 inverted repeat) and the 3′ region of the msdRNA (a2 inverted repeat) forming a stem that ends with the branching guanosine (G0) and its opposing guanosine (G127) (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In the Retron-Eco7 structure, the msDNA consists of a 41-nt msrRNA (nucleotides (−58)–(−18)) and a 73-nt msdDNA (nucleotides 5–77), with nucleotides (−55)–(−50) in the msrRNA and nucleotides 72–77 in the msdDNA forming an RNA–DNA heteroduplex (Fig. 2a–c and Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). The present structure reveals that nucleotides 1–77 in the msdDNA are reverse-transcribed, whereas a previous study reported that the Retron-Eco7 msDNA contains a 78-nucleotide msdDNA (thus, Retron-Eco7 was formerly called Retron-Ec78)24. Similarly, the recently reported Retron-Eco1 structure showed that its msDNA contains an 85-nucleotide msdDNA21,22,23, which is one nucleotide shorter than previously reported27. These discrepancies might arise from incorrect estimations of msdDNA lengths in earlier biochemical studies24,27. In the present structure, the msrRNA contains a linker region (referred to as L1, nucleotides (−49)–(−40)) and stem loop 2 (SL2, nucleotides (−39)–(−18)), while the msdDNA contains stem loop 3 (SL3, nucleotides 5–64) and a linker region (referred to as L2, nucleotides 65–71) (Fig. 2a–c and Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). No densities were observed for nucleotides 0–(−17) in the msrRNA and nucleotides 1–4 in the msdDNA (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4c), consistent with our data indicating that these regions were processed by endogenous nucleases in E. coli (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Overall, these observations confirmed that the msDNA in the Retron-Eco7 complex exists as a non-branched RNA–DNA hybrid, as previously reported24,26.

The RT in Retron-Eco7 (RT-Eco7) is structurally similar to other known RTs, such as the RT in Retron-Eco1 (RT-Eco1)21,22,23 and the RT domain of the Bombyx mori R2 retrotransposon (RT-R2Bm)28,29, and adopts a right-hand-shaped fold consisting of palm, finger, and thumb domains (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). SL2 and L1/L2 of the msDNA are extensively recognized by the thumb and palm/finger domains, respectively, while stem loop 3 forms only a few contacts with the palm domain at its 5′ end (Figs. 2d, e and 3). The RNA–DNA heteroduplex is bound to the active site formed by the palm, finger, and thumb domains, with the conserved YADD motif (residues 185–188) in the palm domain located near the 3′ end of the msdDNA (Figs. 2d, f and 3). A structural comparison of RT-Eco7 with RT-R2Bm revealed that, in the Retron-Eco7 structure, the binding site of an incoming nucleotide is occupied by A(–47) in the msrRNA L1 linker (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 5a), while the template nucleotide U(–49) is flipped out from the heteroduplex and forms hydrogen bonds with Q46 (finger) and A69 (L2), with its nucleobase stacked between Y32 (finger) and A70 (L2) (Figs. 2g and 3). Thus, the present structure represents a termination state in the reverse-transcription reaction. To assess the functional relevance of the RT–msDNA interactions, we examined the effects of alanine mutations in the RT enzyme on the Retron-Eco7 activity using spot assays in E. coli. The D187A/D188A mutations in the RT active site abolished the defense activity (Fig. 2h), confirming the critical role of the reverse transcription activity in the Retron-Eco7 function. The thumb domain deletion (Δ235–313) also abolished the activity (Fig. 2h), indicating the functional importance of the interaction between the thumb domain and the msrRNA stem loop 2. In addition, the Y32A, R42A, and Q46A mutations moderately or substantially reduced the activity (Fig. 2h), highlighting the importance of the interactions stabilizing the reverse-transcription termination state.

The residues that interact with nucleic acids through their main chains are shown in parentheses.

While the msrRNA and msdDNA regions of Retron-Eco7 share sequence similarity with those of Retron-Eco1, the structures of their msdDNA regions differ substantially (Supplementary Fig. 5a, c). In the Retron-Eco1 structure, SL2 and L1/L2 of the msDNA are recognized by the RT in a manner similar to that observed in the Retron-Eco7 structure, with the RT active site occluded by an adenosine corresponding to A(–47) of the Retron-Eco7 msrRNA21,22,23 (Supplementary Fig. 5a). These structural findings suggest that Retron-RT-mediated reverse transcription terminates at a specific position in the msdRNA, with the termination site defined by interactions between the RT and SL2–L2 in the msrRNA, consistent with previous biochemical data22. However, there are notable structural differences between the Retron-Eco7 and Retron-Eco1 complexes. SL1 and the a1:a2 stem are flexible and disordered in the Retron-Eco7 structure, whereas the corresponding regions are ordered and interact with the RT in the Retron-Eco1 structure (Supplementary Fig. 5a). In addition, the orientation of msdDNA SL3 in the Retron-Eco1 complex differs from that in the Retron-Eco7 complex (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Together, these observations highlight both the conserved and divergent structural features among the RT–msDNA complexes in different retron systems.

PtuA consists of an N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1–63), an ATPase domain (residues 64–254 and 311–442), a coiled-coil (CC) domain (residues 255–310), a linker domain (residues 443–483), and a C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 484–550) (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Figs. 6a and 7a, b). The NTD comprises three α-helices and two β-strands. Two N-terminal α-helices in the PtuA.1 NTD interact with RT–msDNA, while those of PtuA.2, PtuA.3, and PtuA.4 are less resolved in the density map, due to the lack of interactions (Fig. 4b). The CC domain comprises two α-helices and mediates PtuA–PtuA interactions, while the CTD contains three α-helices and participates in PtuA–PtuB interactions (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 7a, b).

The ATPase domain adopts an ABC ATPase fold with the Walker A (93-GNNGKGKT-100) and Walker B (391-IVLIDE-396) motifs (Fig. 4a, c and Supplementary Fig. 7b, c). Similar to other known ATPases30, the ATPase domains of PtuA.1 and PtuA.3 interact with those of PtuA.2 and PtuA.4, respectively, to form head-to-head dimers, which are further stabilized by their linker domains (Supplementary Fig. 7a, c). Interestingly, two ADP molecules are bound to the active sites at the PtuA.1–PtuA.2 interface, with the Walker A motifs engaging the ADP phosphate groups (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 7c). In contrast, one ADP molecule is bound at the PtuA.3–PtuA.4 interface, as the Walker A motif in PtuA.3 adopts an α-helical conformation rather than a loop conformation, for unknown reasons (Supplementary Fig. 7c). In the ADP-bound PtuA ATPase domains (PtuA.1, PtuA.2, and PtuA.4), N95 (Walker A) and E396 (Walker B) in one protomer form hydrogen bonds with H400/H402 and H400 in the neighboring protomer, respectively, stabilizing the dimer interface (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 7c). Notably, the N95A, E396A, and H400A mutations abolished the anti-phage defense activity in E. coli (Fig. 4d), indicating that the ADP-mediated dimerization of PtuA is essential for the Retron-Eco7 function.

To further investigate the functional role of the bound ADP molecules, we measured the in vitro ATPase activities of the purified PtuA alone, the WT Retron-Eco7 complex, and those containing either the PtuA D395A mutation or the PtuB H57A mutation. The Retron-Eco7 complex, but not PtuA alone, hydrolyzed ATP to produce ADP, while the PtuA D395A mutation, but not the PtuB H57A mutation, abolished the ATPase activity (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). These results indicate that PtuA functions as an active ATPase within the Retron-Eco7 complex. Thus, the bound ADP molecules are likely produced from ATP in E. coli cells via the PtuA ATPase activity within the Retron-Eco7 complex. Given that an E-to-Q mutation in the Walker B motif of the Rad50 ATPase abolished ATP hydrolysis while retaining ATP binding31, we examined the anti-phage defense activity of the Retron-Eco7 complex containing the equivalent PtuA E396Q mutation in the Walker B motif. The E396Q mutation abolished the defense activity in E. coli (Fig. 4d), indicating that PtuA-mediated ATP hydrolysis, rather than ATP binding alone, is necessary for the Retron-Eco7 function. These findings suggest that, within the Retron-Eco7 complex, PtuA continuously hydrolyzes ATP to produce ADP, which stabilizes the PtuA dimer and facilitates the interaction between RT–msDNA and PtuA–PtuB.

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the stability of the WT and mutant Retron-Eco7 complexes using size-exclusion chromatography. The WT and PtuB H57A mutant complexes eluted as single peaks (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b), confirming their stability. In contrast, the PtuA D395A mutation resulted in the dissociation of the PtuA–PtuB complex from the RT–msDNA complex (Supplementary Fig. 8c), indicating that the PtuA-mediated ADP production is essential for the interaction between RT–msDNA and PtuA–PtuB. This mechanism is reminiscent of that for the Rad50 ATPase, where ATP binding promotes Rad50 dimerization and enhances DNA interactions31,32,33. Unlike the PtuA D395A mutation, the PtuB H57A mutation did not cause dissociation of the complex but instead increased its aggregation (Supplementary Fig. 8b). These results suggest that the integrity of the PtuB active site is important for the stability of the Retron-Eco7 complex, thereby affecting PtuA-mediated ATP hydrolysis, consistent with our findings that the PtuB H57A mutation reduces the ATPase activity (Fig. 4e). Taken together, these data indicate that PtuA hydrolyzes ATP to generate ADP, thus helping to maintain the structural integrity of the Retron-Eco7 complex.

PtuB consists of an HNH nuclease domain (residues 1–152) and a C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 153–216) (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 6b). The HNH domain of PtuB is similar to other HNH domains34, such as those of PtuB from the Septu defense system35 and Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9)36,37 (Supplementary Fig. 9a). The HNH domain of PtuB contains a conserved histidine residue (H57) and resembles that of SpCas9 in its active, rather than inactive, conformation (Supplementary Fig. 9b–d), suggesting that PtuB in the Retron-Eco7 complex adopts a nearly active conformation. Unlike the other HNH domains, the PtuB HNH domain contains a zinc finger, in which a zinc ion is coordinated by C43, C46, C78, and C90 (Supplementary Fig. 9e). Alanine substitutions of these cysteine residues (C43A/C46A/C78A/C90A) abolished the defense activity (Fig. 4d), highlighting the functional importance of the zinc finger in PtuB. The CTD of PtuB contains three α-helices and interacts with the CTDs of PtuA (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 9a).

The two PtuA–PtuB complexes associate with the RT–msDNA scaffold primarily through interactions between the msdDNA and the PtuA dimers, while PtuB.1 and PtuB.2 interact with PtuA.1–PtuA.2 and PtuA.3–PtuA.4 through their CTDs, respectively (Figs. 3 and 4b, f, g). Specifically, residues R126, R163, R171, and K180 of PtuA.1, PtuA.3, and PtuA.4 interact with the nucleobases or backbone phosphate groups of the msdDNA (Figs. 3 and 4f). Mutations of these residues resulted in mild (R171A and K180A) or substantial (R126A and R163A) reductions in Retron-Eco7-mediated anti-phage defense (Fig. 4i), confirming the functional importance of the PtuA–msdDNA interactions. Consistently, E. coli cells expressing Retron-Eco7 with either the R126A or R163A mutation in PtuA exhibited growth defects, as observed in E. coli cells expressing only PtuA–PtuB (Fig. 4j), highlighting the significance of the PtuA–msdDNA interaction in suppressing the toxicity of PtuA–PtuB. Among the four PtuA molecules, PtuA.1 interacts with the msrRNA sugar-phosphate backbone, with its NTD contacting both stem loop 2 and the linker region in the msrRNA (Figs. 3 and 4h). Deletion of the two N-terminal α-helices (residues 3–36) of PtuA abolished the anti-phage defense activity (Fig. 4i), underscoring the functional importance of the PtuA–msrRNA interaction. E471 of PtuA.1 and D521, K526, and R533 of PtuA.2 form salt bridges with R160, R49, E200, and E192 of PtuB.2, respectively (Fig. 4g). The D521R mutation, but not E471R, K526E, and R533E, in PtuA reduced the anti-phage defense activity (Fig. 4i), confirming the functional importance of the PtuA–PtuB interaction. Deletions of the PtuA CC domain (residues 260–305), PtuA CTD (residues 484–550), and PtuB CTD (residues 135–216) also reduced the defense activity (Fig. 4i), suggesting that these domains are essential for the complex formation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the formation of the RT–msDNA–PtuA–PtuB complex is essential for Retron-Eco7-mediated anti-phage defense.

Our recent study indicated that E. coli tRNATyr (Ec-tRNATyr) is degraded by the Retron-Eco7 system upon phage infection, leading to abortive infection25. To investigate whether Ec-tRNATyr is cleaved by the Retron-Eco7 system, we infected E. coli cells (with or without Retron-Eco7) with the SP15m phage, extracted total RNA from the cells at 20 min post infection, and detected Ec-tRNATyr using northern blotting. We observed cleavage fragments of Ec-tRNATyr in the lysates from SP15m-infected E. coli cells containing Retron-Eco7, but not in those lacking Retron-Eco7 (Supplementary Fig. 10a). In contrast, cleavage products were not detected in the lysates from SP15m-uninfected cells, regardless of the presence of Retron-Eco7 (Supplementary Fig. 10a). These results indicated that Ec-tRNATyr is cleaved by the Retron-Eco7 system upon phage infection. Mutations in either PtuA (D395A) or PtuB (H57A) resulted in the loss of Ec-tRNATyr cleavage fragments (Supplementary Fig. 10a), confirming that both PtuA and PtuB are necessary for tRNATyr cleavage. To determine the cleavage site of Ec-tRNATyr, we performed tRNA fragment sequencing on total RNA extracted from SP15-infected E. coli cells with Retron-Eco7, as well as from SP15-uninfected cells with only PtuA–PtuB. We detected an Ec-tRNATyr fragment downstream of U47 in the total tRNA from both cell types (Supplementary Fig. 10b), indicating that the Retron-Eco7 system is activated upon phage infection, with PtuA–PtuB cleaving Ec-tRNATyr between U47 and C48 in the variable loop region.

Our recent study showed that SP15 phage-encoded tRNATyr (SP-tRNATyr) suppresses the Retron-Eco7-mediated anti-phage defense25. To explore its mechanism, we infected E. coli cells (with or without Retron-Eco7) with either SP15 or the tRNATyr-lacking SP15 mutant (SP15m), and then visualized Ec-tRNATyr, SP-tRNATyr, and E. coli tRNAGly (Ec-tRNAGly) using northern blotting. In E. coli cells with Retron-Eco7, Ec-tRNATyr, but neither SP-tRNATyr nor Ec-tRNAGly, was cleaved after phage infection (Fig. 5a). Both Ec-tRNATyr and SP-tRNATyr possess longer variable loops as compared to other tRNAs, such as Ec-tRNAGly (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 10c, d), consistent with the observation that Ec-tRNAGly was not cleaved by Retron-Eco7. Co-expression of Retron-Eco7 with SP-tRNATyr, but not with Ec-tRNATyr, in E. coli led to the loss of defense against SP15m (Fig. 5c). In contrast, co-expression of Retron-Eco7 with SP-tRNATyr mutants, in which the variable loop (A47–U59) was deleted or replaced with the 5-nt shorter loop of Ec-tRNATyr, provided defense against SP15m (Fig. 5c), highlighting the importance of the variable loop of SP-tRNATyr for Retron-Eco7 inhibition. Furthermore, E. coli cells expressing PtuA–PtuB with either Ec-tRNATyr or SP-tRNATyr exhibited normal growth (Fig. 5d), indicating that the overexpression of these tRNAs neutralizes the PtuA–PtuB toxicity. Collectively, these results suggest that SP-tRNATyr compensates for the decreased levels of Ec-tRNATyr, thereby leading to the suppression of the Retron-Eco7 anti-phage defense.

a Northern blot analysis of Ec-tRNATyr, SP-tRNATyr, and Ec-tRNAGly. Total RNA was extracted from E. coli cells (with or without Retron-Eco7) with or without phage infection (SP15 or SP15m), and resolved by 10% denaturing urea-PAGE. Total RNA was visualized using ethidium bromide, while Ec-tRNATyr, SP-tRNATyr, and Ec-tRNAGly were individually detected using northern blotting. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. b Schematics of Ec-tRNATyr and SP-tRNATyr. The Ec-tRNATyr site cleaved by Retron-Eco7 is indicated by a yellow triangle. tRNA modifications are omitted for clarity. c Suppression of Retron-Eco7 by the phage-encoded SP-tRNATyr. E. coli cells were transformed with WT Retron-Eco7 together with either Ec-tRNATyr, SP-tRNATyr, or SP-tRNATyr mutants (V-loop deletion or chimera), and their defense activities against SP15m were evaluated using spot assays. The variable loop (G47–C60) of SP-tRNAᵀʸʳ was deleted and replaced with that of Ec-tRNAᵀʸʳ (G46–C54) in the V-loop deletion and chimera mutants, respectively. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. d Growth curves of E. coli cells expressing only PtuA–PtuB or co-expressing PtuA–PtuB along with either Ec-tRNATyr, SP-tRNATyr, or Ec-tRNAGly. Data represent the mean ± SD of three biological replicates (n = 3).

To clarify how Retron-Eco7 detects phage infection, we infected E. coli cells containing Retron-Eco7 with SP15m and then isolated four escaper phages that evaded the Retron-Eco7 defense (Supplementary Fig. 11a). Whole-genome sequencing revealed that all four escaper phages contain point mutations in the gene encoding the D15 nuclease, which is essential for the expression of late genes in T5 phage genomes38 (Fig. 6a). Given that D15 exhibits endonuclease activity and that the escaper mutation (R86Q and R86L) is located near the active site in the D15–DNA complex structure39,40 (Supplementary Fig. 11b, c), we hypothesized that D15 cleaves the msdDNA within the Retron-Eco7 complex, allowing PtuA–PtuB to dissociate from the complex. First, we confirmed that the purified D15 protein cleaves both single- and double-stranded DNAs, but not single-stranded RNA, in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 11d, e). Next, we incubated the purified WT D15 or its mutants (R86L or R86Q) with the Retron-Eco7 complex and examined the cleavage of msDNA by urea-PAGE. The WT D15 cleaved the msdDNA, but not the msrRNA, within the Retron-Eco7 complex (Fig. 6b). In contrast, both mutants failed to efficiently cleave the msdDNA (Fig. 6b). Furthermore, the Retron-Eco7 complex treated with D15 yielded two distinct peaks corresponding to PtuA–PtuB and RT–msDNA on size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 6c), indicating that D15-mediated msdDNA cleavage facilitates the dissociation of PtuA–PtuB from the Retron-Eco7 complex. To further explore D15's role in Retron-Eco7 activation, we measured the in vitro tRNA cleavage activities of the Retron-Eco7 complex with and without D15 treatment. Unexpectedly, the Retron-Eco7 complex did not efficiently cleave either Ec-tRNATyr or SP-tRNATyr, regardless of the D15 treatment, at least under our conditions (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 11f). Consistently, in contrast to the expression of PtuA–PtuB, the co-expression of Retron-Eco7 and D15 did not induce cell dormancy in E. coli (Fig. 6e). Whereas the PtuA–PtuB nucleases from the Septu system35 and the Retron-Eco4 system (also known as Retron-Ec83 or Retron-Septu)41 degrade dsDNA and ssDNA, respectively, the Retron-Eco7 complex exhibited almost no DNA cleavage activity (Supplementary Fig. 11g). Collectively, our data indicate that D15 is necessary but not sufficient for Retron-Eco7 activation, suggesting that additional unknown factors are required for the activation.

a Spot assays of the isolated escaper SP15m phages. E. coli cells harboring the Retron-Eco7 plasmid or an empty vector were infected with the SP15m phage or the four escaper phages. Mutations in the D15 nuclease gene in the escaper phages are indicated on the right. b In vitro msDNA cleavage by the D15 nuclease. The purified Retron-Eco7 complex was incubated with purified WT D15 or its mutants (R86L or R86Q) at 37 °C for 1, 5, and 30 min, and then analyzed by denaturing urea-PAGE. The nucleic acids were visualized with SYBR Gold. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. c Dissociation of PtuA–PtuB from the Retron-Eco7 complex by D15 treatment. The purified Retron-Eco7 complex was incubated with the purified D15 nuclease at 37 °C for 10 min, and then separated by size-exclusion chromatography. The peak fractions (indicated by a red line) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and denaturing urea-PAGE. The proteins and nucleic acids were visualized with CBB and SYBR Gold, respectively. Experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. d In vitro tRNA cleavage by the Retron-Eco7 complex. The 5′-Cy5-labeled Ec-tRNATyr (200 nM) was incubated with the purified Retron-Eco7 complex (500 nM) with or without the purified D15 (500 nM) at 37 °C for 60 min, and then analyzed by denaturing urea-PAGE. The nucleic acids (msrRNA and msdDNA) were visualized with SYBR Gold, while Ec-tRNATyr was detected using Cy5 fluorescence. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. e Spot assays of E. coli cells expressing Retron-Eco7 (with or without D15), D15, or PtuA–PtuB. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. f Proposed model of the Retron-Eco7 anti-phage defense.

Our functional and structural data suggest that, in the Retron-Eco7 system, RT–msDNA binds to the PtuA–PtuB effector nuclease and inhibits the cleavage of the host tRNATyr by PtuA–PtuB, while PtuA–PtuB dissociates from RT–msDNA upon phage infection, leading to the host tRNATyr cleavage and thereby conferring anti-phage defense through abortive infection (Fig. 6f). Our findings reinforce the concept that, in retron systems, the RT–msDNA and effector proteins function as an anti-toxin and a toxin, respectively, thus protecting host bacterial cells.

The Retron-Eco7 complex structure represents the second example of a structurally characterized retron complex, enabling structural comparisons between different retron complexes. Notable similarities and differences exist between the Retron-Eco7 complex and the recently reported Retron-Eco1 complex21,22,23 (Fig. 7a). The ncRNAs of Eco1 and Eco7 contain similar msrRNA sequences but differ in their msdRNA sequences (which serve as templates for reverse transcription). In the structures of Eco1 and Eco7, the msdRNA regions are reverse-transcribed by the RT into msdDNA, forming an msrRNA–msdDNA hybrid. In particular, the RT–msDNA complexes in the Eco1 and Eco7 systems adopt similar reverse-transcription termination states. In both structures, the msrRNA–msdDNA heteroduplex is accommodated within the RT active site, with the terminal nucleotide in the msdDNA defined by RT–msrRNA interactions in comparable manners. In contrast, the msdDNA nucleotides outside the heteroduplex adopt distinct structures and serve as scaffolds to recruit their cognate effector proteins, highlighting the common principle that the RT–msDNA binds its cognate effector to suppress the toxicity of the effector prior to phage infection. However, the binding modes of RT–msDNA to effectors differ substantially between the Eco1 and Eco7 structures (Fig. 7a). In the Eco7 structure, one RT–msDNA complex interacts with two effectors (PtuA–PtuB), primarily through msDNA–PtuA interactions. In contrast, in the Eco1 structure, one RT–msDNA complex associates with a single effector (N-glycosidase), forming a dimer primarily through effector–effector interactions. Furthermore, the Eco1 dimer interacts with another Eco1 dimer through RT–RT interactions, thereby forming a filament structure. Consistent with these structural differences, RT-Eco7 lacks the α helix corresponding to the N-terminal α helix in RT-Eco1, which is essential for Eco1 dimerization.

We identified the phage-encoded D15 nuclease as a trigger for the type I-A Retron-Eco7. Our biochemical data demonstrated that D15 cleaves the msDNA in the Retron-Eco7 complex, facilitating the release of PtuA–PtuB from RT–msDNA. Recently, George et al. reported that, in the type I-A retron system from E. coli FORC 82 (Retron-FORC), one RT–msDNA complex associates with two PtuA–PtuB effector nucleases to form a large complex similar to the Retron-Eco7 complex42. In addition, George et al. showed that the co-expression of the Retron-FORC system and D15 leads to msDNA degradation in E. coli, thereby inducing cell death42. These findings highlight the conserved role of D15 as a trigger protein among type I-A retrons. In contrast, in the type II-A3 Retron-Eco1 system, the phage-encoded Dcm methylase serves as the trigger and methylates the msdDNA in the Retron-Eco1 complex, likely leading to a conformational change in the N-glycosidase effector23. Subsequently, the effector enzyme hydrolyzes NAD(P)+ to produce a 5′-diphosphate ribose, potentially resulting in NAD(P)+ depletion and DNA ADP ribosylation, although the detailed mechanism remains unclear22,23. These observations reinforce the notion that msDNAs function as sensors of phage infection through diverse mechanisms. Recent studies showed that other retrons, such as Retron-Sen220 and Retron-Eco618, possess ncRNAs with distinct msdRNA sequences, utilize specific effectors with diverse activities, and detect different phage components, highlighting the structural and mechanistic variations among retron systems.

Like the Retron-Eco7 system, the Septu defense system employs the PtuA–PtuB nuclease for anti-phage defense35. However, there are notable differences in their action mechanisms. First, PtuA–PtuB degrades the phage DNA in the Septu system, but cleaves the host tRNATyr in the Retron-Eco7 system. Second, Retron-Eco7 PtuA exhibits ATPase activity, whereas Septu PtuA lacks ATPase activity and functions as an ATP-binding protein, with the DNase activity of PtuA–PtuB inhibited by ATP binding. Third, the RNase activity of Retron-Eco7 PtuA–PtuB is triggered by D15-mediated msDNA cleavage, while the DNase activity of Septu PtuA–PtuB is enhanced by the reduced cellular ATP levels upon phage infection. A structural comparison of the PtuA–PtuB complexes from the Septu and Retron-Eco7 systems provides insights into their mechanistic differences (Fig. 7b). In both structures, the PtuA dimer binds to PtuB in a similar manner, but the PtuA–PtuB complexes adopt distinct oligomeric states. In the Retron-Eco7 structure, two PtuA dimers extensively interact with the msDNA, with their CC domains stabilizing the complex. In contrast, in the Septu structure, two PtuA dimers are bridged by a third PtuA dimer (lacking PtuB), without direct contacts between the first and second dimers. Consistent with these structural differences, Septu PtuA lacks a CC domain. These structural variations likely reflect the functional differences between the PtuA–PtuB nucleases in the two systems. However, it remains unclear why Retron-Eco7 PtuA–PtuB cleaves the host tRNA, while Septu PtuA–PtuB degrades the phage DNA, given that both PtuB nucleases adopt similar HNH folds.

Unexpectedly, our data indicated that Retron-Eco7 cleaved tRNATyr in phage-infected E. coli cells, but not in vitro even after treatment with the D15 nuclease. Consistent with our findings, Wang et al. recently reported that Retron-Eco7 does not cleave tRNATyr in vitro, even after msDNA degradation by DNase I43. Wang et al. and Li et al. determined the cryo-EM structures of the Retron-Eco7 complex, comprising RT–msDNA, PtuA, and PtuB, which are essentially identical to our complex structure43,44. Furthermore, Wang et al. and Li et al. reported the cryo-EM structures of the RT–msDNA-unbound PtuA–PtuB complex in distinct stoichiometries (PtuA4–PtuB243 and PtuA2–PtuB144), demonstrating that PtuA and PtuB can form a complex after dissociation from RT–msDNA, although the stoichiometry of the functional complex remains unclear. To gain mechanistic insights into tRNATyr recognition by PtuA–PtuB, we used AlphaFold 345 to predict a structural model of the PtuA–PtuB complex bound to tRNATyr, based on the RT–msDNA-unbound PtuA4–PtuB2 structure. We obtained structural models of the tRNATyr-bound PtuA–PtuB complex, in which the active site of the PtuB nuclease is located near either the anticodon loop or the CCA end of tRNATyr (Supplementary Fig. 12). A structural comparison of the Retron-Eco7 complex with the tRNA-bound PtuA–PtuB complex suggests that RT–msDNA prevents the tRNA substrate from accessing the PtuB active site, and that the dissociation of PtuA–PtuB from RT–msDNA allows for tRNA recognition. However, we did not obtain a model where the PtuB active site is located near the tRNATyr variable loop containing the cleavage site identified in our RNA-seq analysis. Thus, how tRNATyr is recognized and cleaved by the PtuA–PtuB complex remains unresolved. Notably, the co-expression of Retron-Eco7 and D15 did not induce bacterial growth arrest, suggesting that additional factors are necessary for the full activation of Retron-Eco7. It is possible that unknown factors further facilitate the dissociation of PtuB from the PtuA–PtuB complex, activating the PtuB nuclease.

While our manuscript was under revision, Wang et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of the type I-A Retron-Eco4 complex, comprising one RT–msDNA complex and two PtuA–PtuB effector nucleases41. Although the Retron-Eco4 complex is structurally similar to the Retron-Eco7 complex, it cleaves ssDNA, rather than tRNATyr, underscoring the functional diversity within type I-A retrons (Fig. 7b). However, the mechanisms of Retron-Eco4 activation and specific substrate recognition by the two type I-A retron systems remain unknown.

Recent studies reported that the PARIS defense system also targets host tRNA and protects bacterial cells against phage infection46,47,48, illuminating the mechanistic similarities between the Retron-Eco7 and PARIS systems. Furthermore, phage-encoded tRNAs can neutralize both systems, highlighting their biological role in countering bacterial defense systems, as described in recent studies25,49. However, there are notable mechanistic differences between the two systems. In the PARIS system, AriA (the ABC ATPase antitoxin) and AriB (the TOPRIM nuclease toxin) form a supramolecular complex, and the phage-encoded Ocr protein promotes the dissociation of AriB, which subsequently dimerizes and becomes activated to cleave the host tRNALys47,48.

In summary, this study revealed that the Retron-Eco7 system cleaves the host tRNATyr during phage infection and provides anti-phage defense through abortive infection. However, further studies will be needed to understand its mechanism of action, and particularly how the Retron-Eco7 system becomes activated and cleaves tRNATyr.

The SP15 and SP15m phages were isolated and cultivated as previously described25 (Supplementary Data 1). For the spot assay, 300 μL of an overnight culture of E. coli (DH10B) harboring the indicated plasmids (Supplementary Data 1) was mixed with 10 mL of LB top agar (LB medium, 0.5% agarose, and 1 mM CaCl2) and poured onto an LB agar plate. For the spot assays in Figs. 1d, 2h, 4d and i and Supplementary Fig. 1b, c, 0.2% L-arabinose was added to the LB medium at the beginning of the culture to induce constitutive expression of Retron-Eco7. The phage solution was serially diluted tenfold in Sodium-Magnesium (SM) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgSO4, and 0.01% (w/v) gelatin solution). Then, 3 µL of each phage dilution was spotted onto the bacterial lawn. Plates were incubated at room temperature until the spots dried and then at 37 °C overnight. Lysis zones (plaques) were recorded the following day. For Figs. 2h and 4d and i, plaque-forming units (PFU) per volume were quantified and plotted using GraphPad Prism 10 (GraphPad).

E. coli cells containing the indicated plasmids (Supplementary Data 1) were grown at 37 °C overnight in LB medium. The overnight cultures were then diluted 100-fold in LB medium containing 0.1% L-arabinose and, if indicated, infected with phages at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI). A 100 µL aliquot of each diluted culture was transferred to a 96-well plate, which was sealed with a Breathe-Easy sealing membrane (Sigma Aldrich). Growth was monitored at 37 °C for 10 h with shaking, and OD600 values were measured every 20 min using a SpectraMax iD5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Raw data were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism 10.

For the purification of the Retron-Eco7 complex, the gene encoding the ncRNA (144 nt) was amplified by PCR and cloned into a modified pACYCDuet-1 vector (Novagen) to construct pACYC-ncRNA (Supplementary Data 1). The operon encoding the RT (residues 1–311), PtuA (residues 1–550), and PtuB (residues 1–216) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pET28a vector to construct pET-His6-RT–PtuA–PtuB-Twin-strep (PtuB with a C-terminal Twin-strep tag) (Supplementary Data 1). The genes encoding D15 (residues 1–291) and PtuA were individually cloned into a modified pE-SUMO vector with an N-terminal His6-SUMO tag (LifeSensors). To prepare mutants, mutations were introduced using a PCR-based method, and the sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

For the expression of the Retron-Eco7 complex (RT–ncRNA–PtuA–PtuB), E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) cells transformed with pACYC-ncRNA and pET-His6-RT–PtuA–PtuB-Twin-strep were cultured at 37 °C until the OD600 reached 0.8, and protein expression was then induced with 0.2 mM IPTG (Nacalai Tesque). The E. coli cells were further cultured at 18 °C overnight, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM PMSF), and lysed by sonication. The lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to Strep-Tactin XT 4 Flow high-capacity resin (IBA). The complex was then eluted with buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM biotin, 300 mM NaCl, and 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). The complex was purified on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (Cytiva), equilibrated with buffer C (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). To examine the stability of the Retron-Eco7 complex and its mutants, the complexes were purified by Strep-Tactin beads and then analyzed on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva), equilibrated with buffer C (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). The purified complex was stored at −80 °C until use, except for the cryo-EM analysis and tRNA cleavage assays, for which the freshly prepared complex was used without freezing. The protein concentration was measured using the Pierce 660-nm Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The synthetic tRNAs were purchased from Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma.

For the expression of His6-SUMO tagged D15, E. coli Rosetta2 (DE3) (Novagen) cells were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium until the OD600 reached 0.8, and then induced with 0.2 mM IPTG and cultured overnight at 20 °C. The cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer D (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM imidazole, 1 M NaCl, 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM PMSF), and lysed by sonication. The lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to Ni-NTA Superflow resin (QIAGEN) and eluted with buffer E (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, and 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). After treatment with SUMO protease (prepared in-house), the protein was further purified on a HiTrap Heparin column (Cytiva), equilibrated with buffer F (50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM TCEP). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15–2 M NaCl, and then further purified on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column, equilibrated with buffer G (50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). The purified protein was stored at −80 °C until use.

His6-SUMO tagged PtuA was expressed in E. coli and purified using Ni-NTA resin, following the same protocol as for D15. The protein was treated with SUMO protease, and then loaded onto a HiTrap Heparin column, equilibrated with buffer H (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.3–2 M NaCl, and further purified on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva), equilibrated with buffer I (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). The purified protein was stored at −80 °C until use.

The purified RT–msDNA–PtuA–PtuB complex (Retron-Eco7 complex) solution (5.0 mg/mL) was mixed with 0.25% (final concentration) CHAPSO (Nacalai Tesque). The mixture (3 μL) was immediately applied to freshly glow-discharged Au 300 mesh R1.2/1.3 grids (Quantifoil), using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI) at 4 °C, with a waiting time of 10 s and a blotting time of 6 s under 100% humidity conditions. The grids were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane cooled at liquid nitrogen temperature. Cryo-EM data were collected using a Titan Krios G3i microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific), running at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan Quantum-LS Energy Filter (GIF) and a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector in the correlated double sampling mode (The University of Tokyo, Japan). Movies were recorded at a nominal magnification of 105,000×, corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 0.83 Å, with an electron exposure of 7.74 e−/pix/sec for 4.60 s, resulting in an accumulated exposure of 49.7 e−/Å2. The data were automatically acquired by the image shift method using the EPU software (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with a defocus range of −0.8 to −2.0 μm, and 7847 movies were acquired.

Data processing was performed using the cryoSPARC v4.6.2 software package50. Dose-fractionated movies were aligned using Patch motion correction, and the contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were approximated using Patch-Based CTF estimation with the default settings. Particles were automatically picked using Topaz Picker51. The picked particles were divided into five classes (states 1–5) by Heterogeneous Refinement with the default parameters, using the map derived from cryoSPARC Ab initio Reconstruction as the template. For states 1 and 2, masks were generated for the coiled-coil domain to further classify the conformational heterogeneity, and the selected particles after Heterogeneous Refinement were divided into three classes using 3D Classification without alignment. The best classes for states 1–5, containing 67,204, 125,237, 95,729, 93,471, and 180,392 particles, respectively, were refined using Non-uniform Refinement52 following Reference-Based Motion Correction. This refinement yielded maps with 2.75, 2.62, 2.70, 2.67, and 2.58-Å resolutions, respectively, according to the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion53. Local resolution was estimated using BlocRes in cryoSPARC54.

The models of the Retron-Eco7 complex were automatically built using COOT55, starting from a model built by ModelAngelo56. The models were refined using Servalcat57 against unsharpened half maps, with structural restraints from AlphaFold 258 predictions processed by ProSMART59. The models were validated using MolProbity60. The statistics of the 3D reconstruction and model refinement are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The molecular graphics and cryo-EM density map figures were prepared using CueMol (http://www.cuemol.org) or UCSF ChimeraX61.

ATPase activities were measured using an NADH-coupled assay, at 37 °C in a 384-well plate. Each reaction (40 μL) contained 10 mM ATP and either 1 µM purified Retron-Eco7 complex (either WT, PtuA D395A, or PtuB H57A) or 1 µM PtuA alone, in a reaction buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.3 mM NADH, 9 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 60 µg/mL pyruvate kinase, and 32 µg/mL lactate dehydrogenase. Absorbance at 340 nm (A340) was measured every 1 min for 30 min using a SpectraMax iD5 plate reader (Molecular Devices) to monitor NADH oxidation coupled with ATP hydrolysis. Control reactions containing only 10 mM ATP (without protein) were used to correct for background NADH consumption from non-enzymatic ATP degradation. A340 values were converted to NADH concentrations using a calibration curve. ATPase activity (nmol ATP min−1 mg−1 protein) was calculated from the NADH oxidation rate (mM/min), determined from five data points between 15 and 20 min. Data were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism 10.

E. coli (DH10B) cells containing the pBAD-PtuA–PtuB plasmid were grown in 10 mL of LB medium to an OD600 of 0.3. Expression of PtuA–PtuB was induced with 0.2% L-arabinose, and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking at 200 rpm. E. coli cells containing the empty pBAD vector (pKLC23) were used as the control. The cultures were then centrifuged at 6000 × g for 5 min, and the pellets were washed twice with PBS buffer. Total RNA was extracted using an miRNA isolation kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. For total RNA extraction from Retron-Eco7-expressing cells, E. coli cells containing the Retron-Eco7 plasmid or the empty vector (control) were infected with SP15 (MOI = 10) for 20 min. The cultures were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellets were washed twice with SM buffer. Total RNA was extracted using the miRNA isolation kit. The extracted RNA samples were used for tRNA-fragment sequencing.

tRNA-fragment sequencing was performed by Filgen, Inc. and Arraystar Inc. (Project codes: J_041823-tRF&tiRNAseq-8 and J_102623-tRF&tiRNA-seq-8, respectively). Total RNA samples were initially assessed for integrity using agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA concentrations and protein contamination were measured using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and RNA quality was further evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). To ensure efficient library preparation, RNA samples were pretreated to remove specific modifications that could interfere with the process. These treatments included deacylation of 3′-aminoacyl RNA to 3′-OH, removal of 3′-cP (2′,3′-cyclic phosphate) to generate 3′-OH, phosphorylation of 5′-OH to 5′-P, and demethylation of m1A and m3C to facilitate efficient reverse transcription. Library preparation was performed using a NEBNext® Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina® (New England Biolabs). The workflow included 3′-adapter ligation, 5′-adapter ligation, cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification, and size selection of PCR products between 134 and 160 bp, corresponding to 14–40 nt small RNAs. The quality and quantity of the libraries were assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and equal amounts of each library were pooled based on quantification results. The pooled libraries were denatured with 0.1 M NaOH to produce single-stranded DNA molecules, diluted to a final concentration of 1.8 pM, and sequenced on an Illumina platform following the manufacturer's protocols. Sequencing quality was evaluated using FastQC. Adapter sequences were trimmed from raw reads using Cutadapt62. Processed reads were aligned to mature tRNA sequences, allowing for one mismatch. Reads that did not align to mature tRNAs were subsequently mapped to precursor tRNA sequences using Bowtie63. Unmapped reads were further aligned to miRNA reference sequences using miRDeep264. Expression profiles of tRNA-derived fragments were quantified based on the mapped read counts.

E. coli (DH10B) cells containing either the empty vector, the Retron-Eco7 plasmid, or the Retron-Eco7 mutant plasmids were left uninfected or infected with the SP15 or SP15m phage for 20 min (MOI = 10). The cells were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 1 mL of RNA isolation reagent (40% (w/v) phenol, 1% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 2 M guanidine thiocyanate, 0.1% (w/v) 8-quinolinol, 20 mM tri-sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.1 M NaOAc, pH 4.5, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.2% (w/v) N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt, 50 mM salicylic acid, 10 mM aluminon, and 0.0001% (w/v) bromophenol blue). After vigorous shaking at 4 °C for 20 min, chloroform was added to the solution at a concentration of 20%. The mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the aqueous phase was collected. Total RNA was recovered from the aqueous phase by 2-propanol precipitation. Total RNA (4 μg) was resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea, stained with ethidium bromide, blotted onto a nylon membrane (Amersham Hybond N+; Cytiva), dried, and cross-linked by UV (254 nm, 120 mJ/cm2). The DNA probe for each tRNA (Supplementary Data 1) was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P] ATP (PerkinElmer) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo). The membrane was subjected to hybridization at 53 °C overnight in hybridization buffer (500 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 7.5% SDS, 5% polyethylene glycol 6000, 1 mM EDTA-NaOH, pH 8.0, and 0.5% casein) and 4 pmol of 5′-32P-radiolabeled DNA probe. The membrane was washed three times with SSC (150 mM NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0), dried, and exposed to an imaging plate (BAS-MS2040; Fujifilm) to visualize the hybridization bands, using an FLA-7000 imaging analyzer (Cytiva). Uncropped images are available in Source Data.

E. coli cells carrying the Retron-Eco7 plasmid were infected with the SP15m phage (MOI = 1) and cultured overnight in 4 mL of LB medium at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Afterwards, the lysate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min and filtered through a 0.2 μm membrane. To screen for potential escaper phage, 100 μL of the filtered phage solution, containing both wild-type and escaper phages, was mixed with 100 μL of cultured E. coli carrying either the Retron-Eco7 plasmid or the empty vector. The mixture was combined with 4 mL of LB top agar and poured onto LB plates, and the plates were then incubated overnight at 37 °C. Single plaques formed on the Retron-Eco7-containing cells were identified as escaper mutants. To purify these escaper mutants, individual escaping plaques were propagated, and phage titers were subsequently determined using a plaque assay as described previously25. The purified escaper phages were then tested in plaque assays with E. coli cells containing either the Retron-Eco7 plasmid or the empty vector.

High-titer phage lysates (> 107 PFU/mL) of the mutant phages were used for DNA extraction. The phage lysate (500 μL) was treated with DNase I (3 U/mL) and RNase A (20 ng/mL) (both from Takara), and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to degrade bacterial DNA and RNA. Phage DNA was then extracted using a Phage DNA Extraction Kit (Norgen Biotek Corp.) following the manufacturer's protocols. Whole-genome sequencing was performed by Macrogen Japan, Inc. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using CLC Genomic Workbench (QIAGEN), with silent mutations in protein-coding regions excluded from this analysis. The identified escaper phages are listed in Supplementary Data 1.

To examine D15-mediated msDNA cleavage, the purified Retron-Eco7 complex (100 nM) was incubated with the purified WT D15 (100 nM) or its mutants (R86L and R86Q) (100 nM) at 37 °C for 1, 5, and 30 min, in 10 μL of reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT). To examine D15-mediated DNA and RNA cleavage, the purified WT D15 (100 nM) was incubated with either single-stranded DNA (200 nM), double-stranded DNA (200 nM), or single-stranded RNA (200 nM) at 37 °C for 10 min. The reactions were quenched with Proteinase K (Nacalai Tesque) in denaturing buffer containing 7 M urea, and analyzed by 15% urea-PAGE. The gels were stained with SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and then visualized using the FUSION Solo S imaging system (Vilber Bio Imaging). All experiments were performed at least three times.

To investigate the dissociation of the Retron-Eco7 complex by D15 treatment, the purified Retron-Eco7 complex (210 nM) was incubated with the purified WT D15 (210 nM) at 37 °C for 10 min, in 400 μL of reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT). The reaction mixture was then fractionated on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and urea-PAGE. The gels were stained with Bullet CBB Stain One (Nacalai Tesque) and SYBR Gold, respectively, and then visualized using the FUSION Solo S imaging system. All experiments were performed at least three times.

5′-Cy5-labeled Ec-tRNATyr (200 nM) was incubated with the purified Retron-Eco7 complex (500 nM) with or without D15 (500 nM) at 37 °C for 60 min, in 10 μL of reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT). 5′-Cy5-labeled targets (Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma), including Ec-tRNATyr (200 nM), SP-tRNATyr (200 nM), ssDNA (200 nM), dsDNA (200 nM), or ssRNA (200 nM), were also incubated with the Retron-Eco7 complex (250, 500, or 1000 nM) at 37 °C for 60 min. The reactions were quenched with Proteinase K in denaturing buffer containing 7 M urea, and then analyzed on 15% urea-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). The tRNAs and their fragments were visualized by the Cy5 fluorescence with the FUSION Solo S system. All experiments were performed at least three times.

E. coli (DH10B) cells, containing either the arabinose-inducible Retron-Eco7 (pKLC23-Eco7) or the arabinose-inducible PtuA and PtuB (pKLC23-PtuA–PtuB), along with the anhydrotetracycline-inducible D15 (pKLC83-D15) plasmid (Supplementary Data 1), were cultured overnight. The cultures were then serially diluted tenfold in LB medium. A 3 μL aliquot of each dilution was spotted onto LB agar plates. Expression of Retron-Eco7 or PtuA–PtuB, and D15 was induced by supplementing the plates with 0.2% L-arabinose and 50 ng/mL anhydrotetracycline, respectively. The empty pKLC23 and pKLC83 vectors were used as controls. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and colony growth was evaluated the following day.

Sample sizes were determined based on those used in our previous studies and similar published work that yielded reproducible results. For cryo-EM analyses, particle images that did not improve map quality were excluded using standard classification procedures in cryoSPARC. All biochemical, cellular, and functional assays were conducted with independent replicates following widely accepted protocols in the field (three biological or technical replicates unless otherwise stated). Data are generally presented as the mean ± SD of three or four independent replicates (n  =  3 or 4), and no statistical analysis was performed. All experiments were independently repeated at least three times with similar results, confirming reproducibility. No randomization was performed for biochemical and cellular experiments because these assays involve inherently uniform and controllable samples, such as purified proteins or cell cultures, where variability is minimal compared with live animals. No blinding was performed for biochemical and cellular experiments, as these experiments involve objective measurements under controlled conditions that are not influenced by subjective assessments.

Amazon has announced a new family of frontier artificial intelligence models—and a new way for customers to build frontier models of their own.

The ecommerce giant announced the second generation of its Nova AI models at re:Invent, a company conference held in Las Vegas. The models are nowhere near as popular as those offered by rivals like OpenAI and Google, but Amazon's plan to make them highly customizable could see them gain traction with its cloud users.

Amazon detailed two improved large language models, Nova Lite and Nova Pro, a new real-time voice model called Nova Sonic, and a more experimental model called Nova Omni that performs a simulated kind of reasoning using images, audio, and video as well as text. The new models are being made available today to a limited number of customers.

More significantly, given the importance of its cloud business, Amazon is releasing a tool called Nova Forge that will let customers create specialized frontier models by adding their own training data to unfinished versions of the Nova 2 Lite and Pro models.

It is already possible to fine-tune off-the-shelf AI models like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT. But Amazon's approach lets customers add data at various stages of model training, including the process of building the base model, a stage known as custom pretraining that is normally reserved for large AI labs.

“Everyone is looking for a frontier model that's an expert in their domain,” Rohit Prasad, who leads Amazon's AI efforts, told WIRED ahead of today's announcements. Prasad says that Amazon developed the technologies behind Nova Forge to empower internal teams, including those developing Alexa and AI agents to build custom models. “This is essentially a new open training paradigm,” he says.

One customer that has tested the approach is Reddit, which used Nova Forge to create a custom model to identify content that breaks the platform's rules.

Fine-tuning a conventional model would not work, says Reddit chief technology officer Chris Slowe, because most models are designed to avoid offensive or violent content entirely, meaning they would refuse to analyze some materials. Slowe says that custom pre-training, combined with conventional fine-tuning, produced a frontier model that is expert at understanding and using Reddit.

“Other LLMs understand Reddit as a concept, and how Reddit works, but they're not down in the weeds,” Slowe says. “We really built a Reddit expert model.”

Slowe adds that Reddit's customized model could have a range of uses, and will most likely be put to work next to automate content moderation.

Other companies testing Nova Forge include Booking.com, Sony, and Nimbus Therapeutics, a biotech firm.

Allowing customers to craft specialized models may prove savvy as companies look for tools that go beyond the capabilities of the latest general-purpose models. About three-quarters of US companies see AI as a high priority, according to a survey from the consulting company Bain released in November. Those companies also, however, report a wide range of problems in using AI, among them a lack of expertise and resources needed to build custom models.

Today most AI models are either closed, meaning they can only be accessed through API or app, or open, meaning they can be downloaded and run on one's own hardware. Many companies opt to work with open models—the most popular being ones that come from Chinese companies, like Alibaba and DeepSeek—because they are cheaper to experiment with and can be modified with relative ease. The data used to train these open models is typically not released, however, which limits and complicates the process of tuning them.

Nova Forge offers a new approach, albeit one that is locked into Amazon's cloud. Building a large language model from scratch can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Prasad says a frontier model built using Nova Forge should be significantly cheaper, without providing specifics.

Amazon remains something of a dark horse in the AI race, having been relatively late to develop truly cutting-edge AI language models. The company is, however, quietly building up a portfolio of advanced AI capabilities. It has also integrated generative AI into its shopping platform, for example through an ecommerce-focused chatbot helper called Rufus.

Like other big tech companies, Amazon is investing billions to build new AI infrastructure, part of a colossal—and potentially risky—bet that demand for AI will continue to grow at an impressive clip.

Amazon is competing with Google and Microsoft for cloud customers. OpenAI is also rapidly building its own infrastructure and could someday become a cloud player itself. It has hedged its bets by investing $8 billion in Anthropic, a major competitor to OpenAI founded by staff who left the maker of ChatGPT. Amazon is also looking to challenge Nvidia's hardware dominance; Anthropic's latest models are trained on Amazon's custom Trainium chips.

Amazon says Nova 2 Pro matches or exceeds OpenAI's GPT-5 and GPT-5.1, Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 and Gemini 3.0 Pro, and Sonnet 4.5 from Anthropic across a range of benchmarks. Prasad notes that the model is especially good at agentic tasks like following complex instructions and using tools on a computer. The company says that its smaller model, Nova 2 Lite, is similar to Claude 4.5 Haiku, GPT-5 Mini, and Gemini Flash 2.5 on various benchmarks.

Nova 2 Omni shows that Amazon is no slouch in AI research these days. A fully multimodal reasoning model, it can take images, audio, and video as well as text as input and can perform simulated reasoning to generate output. Prasad says to his knowledge no other AI company has released a fully mutli-model of this kind.

Reddit's Slowe says the customizable nature of Nova is probably its most important quality. “I do believe it has a lot of potential,” he says. “For a large set of situations, it will be substantially better than what we get off the shelf.”

Hackers poking around in iOS 26 recently uncovered something Apple definitely didn't intend anyone to see: every modern iPhone is running the operating system Apple's upcoming “iPhone Fold” will likely use. Which means these phones are—right now—already capable of running a full, fluid desktop experience.

From a performance standpoint, that shouldn't be surprising. At Apple's September 2025 event, the company claimed the A19 Pro chip inside the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro offers “MacBook Pro levels of compute.” And that iPhone chip is reportedly destined to power a cheaper MacBook in 2026. The line between Apple's hardware is being further blurred, then—but what's wild is that the software side of things has blurred completely too. It's just that nobody realized.

For years, Apple has insisted that iOS and iPadOS are distinct, despite sharing code and habitually borrowing each other's features. But a self-proclaimed “tech geek” on Reddit who got iPad features running on an iPhone claimed they're not merely similar—they're essentially the same: “Turns out iOS has all the iPadOS code (and vice versa; you can for instance enable Dynamic Island on iPad).”

TechExpert2910 revealed on Reddit that his hacked iPhone ran iPad OS “incredibly well,” making his 17 Pro Max an “insane pocket computer” with more RAM than his M4 iPad Pro.

The hack relies on an exploit that tricks the iPhone's operating system into thinking it's running on an iPad. That unlocks smallish tweaks such as a landscape Home Screen, an iPad-style app switcher, and more Dock items. But it also provides transformative changes such as running desktop-grade apps that aren't available for iPhone, full windowed multitasking, and optimal external display support. All without Apple Silicon breaking a sweat.

The exploit is already patched in the iOS 26.2 beta, and the Redditor accused Apple of locking out iPhone users and artificially limiting older devices to push upgrades. But are things really that simple?

It's not like the “phone as PC” dream is new. Android's been chasing it since DeX debuted in 2017. Barely anyone cares. So why should Apple? Perhaps the concept is a niche nerd fantasy. And there's the longtime argument that if you want to do “proper” work, you need a “proper” computer. If even an iPad can't replace a computer, how can an iPhone?

In June, after 15 years, the iPad got key software features, including resizable and movable windows.

Except, as WIRED demonstrated, an iPad can replace a computer for plenty of people—you just need the right accessories. It therefore follows the same is true for an iPhone running the exact same software. But where will any momentum for this future come from?

Android 16 is technically ready for another crack at desktop mode, with a new system that builds on DeX. But even now, having finally escaped beta, it's buried in developer settings. That might be down to the grim state of big-screen Android apps, or the desktop experience itself feeling, politely, “rocky.”

Paradoxically, Apple appears to be further ahead despite never announcing any of this. It already has a deep ecosystem of desktop-grade iPad apps. And the iPad features running on iPhone already look polished. Sure, some interface quirks remain, and you might need to file your fingers to a point to hit window controls. But the performance is fast, fluid, and snappy. So if the experience is this good, why is Apple so determined to hide it?

One argument is practical. Apple likes each device to be its own thing, optimized for a specific form factor. It's keen to finesse the transition between platforms rather than have one device to rule them all. A phone lacks a big screen and a physical keyboard. Plugging those things in on a train isn't as elegant as opening a MacBook or using an iPad connected to a Magic Keyboard. However, with imagination, you can see the outlines of a new ecosystem of profitable accessories for a more capable iPhone.

Could the bottom of your iPhone screen look more like this in the future? Apple's current phone software certainly makes it possible.

But Apple hasn't got where it has by selling accessories nor by making a market for others to do so. Most of its profits come from a long-running strategy to nudge people into buying more hardware that coexists. It doesn't want you to choose between an iPhone, an iPad, a MacBook Air, and an iMac. It wants you to buy all of them.

But if an iPhone can do iPad things, maybe someone won't buy an iPad. If iPads act too much like Macs, people might not buy as many Macs. Strategically chosen—if sometimes artificial—limits and product segmentation have pride of place in Cupertino's rulebook. A convergence model could knock user experience and simplicity; but Apple would likely be more fearful of how it could negatively impact sales.

That all said, perhaps there is another explanation: Apple is saving this for an inflection point—the iPhone Fold. Rumors suggest that Apple has solved the “screen crease” problem and will in 2026 ship a foldable with a 7.8-inch, 4:3 display that's similar to (but sharper than) the iPad mini's.

A tablet-sized display that doesn't let you multitask like on an iPad would be absurd, especially on a device likely to cost two or three times more than an actual iPad mini. Doubly so if Apple puts last year's iPhone chip into a MacBook that will have a full desktop environment and support at least one external display.

And for anyone fretting about being forced into a more desktop-style iPhone, Apple already solved that problem. It killed the Steve Jobs vision of the iPad that sat between two computing extremes by letting users switch modes. The iPhone could follow suit, defaulting to its original purist mode while allowing power users to tap into windowing and external device support.

These hacks, then, have given us a window into the iPhone Fold operating system and other aspects of a possible Apple future. They show that iPad features on iPhone already look slick and make complete sense. And the crazy thing is they're in your iPhone's software right now. Next year, they'll almost certainly be unleashed on the most expensive iPhone Apple has ever made. The question is whether Apple will let regular iPhone users have them, too.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","DOGE Isn't Dead. Here's What Its Operatives Are Doing Now","https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-doge-doing-now/","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

To one member of Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, the last few months have been “crazy.” In a slideshow of photos and videos posted to Instagram last month, Yat Choi—who joined DOGE this spring—posted clips of Trump administration officials dancing on the White House lawn to“Y.M.C.A”; people loading into what appears to be a private jet; and house parties decorated with American flags and attendees donning red, white, and blue hats holding red Solo cups and cans of High Noon.

On Instagram, Choi described his work as ongoing, announcing that he was returning to the underground Pennsylvania mine where federal retirement claims are processed. “Like Jigga [Jay-Z] I showed them the blueprint back in April, now going back in the Mine to lead the pilots next week,” wrote Choi, who previously worked as an engineer at AirBnb and has referred to Canada as home in other Instagram posts. Choi did not respond to a request for comment.

It's not just Choi. Many of the original young and inexperienced DOGE technologists whose identities were first reported by WIRED appear to still be enmeshed in federal agencies. Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, Gavin Kliger, Marko Elez, Akash Bobba, and Ethan Shaotran all still claim to be affiliated with DOGE or the US government. So do other tech workers from Silicon Valley and Musk companies like xAI and SpaceX. Coristine, Kliger, Elez, Bobba, and Shaotran did not respond to requests for comment.

The DOGE ethos—characterized by cutting contracts and government workers, consolidating data across agencies, and importing private sector practices—remains fully in force. While several media reports have suggested that DOGE has all but fizzled out, DOGE affiliates are scattered across the federal government working as developers, designers, and even leading agencies in powerful roles.

“That's absolutely false,” one USDA source says of reporting that DOGE has disbanded. “They are in fact burrowed into the agencies like ticks.”

DOGE has “just transformed,” an IRS employee tells WIRED.

While DOGE is no longer moving across the government in a move-fast-and-break-things blitz, DOGE affiliates appear to be digging in for the long haul—and Silicon Valley–shaped fingerprints remain all over the way agencies continue to be run.

Over the last few weeks, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has rolled out coding tests to its hundreds of technical staff, quizzing them over their “technical proficiency.” The decision to roll out these tests came from Sam Corcos, a DOGE operative and chief information officer of the Treasury, according to a source familiar with the situation. Corcos is seeking to overhaul the IRS's 8,500-person IT department, the source says. This is part of a larger ongoing “modernization” process at the US Treasury.

The tests, administered through a tool called HackerRank, have been used by private-sector tech companies like Airbnb, LinkedIn, and PayPal to quiz a potential hire's technical skill. One source at X, the social media company owned by Musk, tells WIRED that X uses “HackerRank's tool to do coding screen-sharing for tech screens and remote interviews,” but confirmed that existing employees are not assessed with the tool.

“They want to see IRS as like a tech company, that's the feeling I get,” says an IRS employee who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to speak to the press.

While coding tests are expected for candidates applying for technical roles, testing existing agency employees is highly unusual, four IRS sources tell WIRED. Early in DOGE's tenure, staffers at the Technology Transformation Services (TTS) were forced to defend their projects on video calls with DOGE members. Government employees were also asked to send weekly emails detailing their work and achievements, which were later reviewed by artificial intelligence. (These emails and project reviews closely resemble the playbook Musk used when he took over X, formerly Twitter, in 2022.)

Despite an all-hands meeting two weeks ago, employees say they still don't feel like they have answers. “They're keeping us in the dark,” says the IRS employee. “They won't tell managers why [they're issuing the tests] or how the results will be used.”

Corcos and the IRS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other DOGE operatives are still working to slash regulations across government as well. Scott Langmack, a DOGE operative at the Department of Housing and Urban Development until July, is now serving as the executive director of “deregulation AI” at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In this role, which Langmack took on in August, he is leading the development of “custom AI applications to accelerate the elimination of the excess regulation constraining American business,” according to his LinkedIn profile. Langmack and OMB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Sam Beyda, who has reportedly been linked to DOGE, is now deputy chief of staff for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), after serving as a policy advisor to deputy secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill. He does not appear to have any public health experience. Prior to joining the federal government, Beyda, who graduated Columbia in 2023, worked at a company that helped manufacture cannabinoids. That company's parent organization is headed by Beyda's father-in-law.

Since president Donald Trump's inauguration, the CDC has lost more than a quarter of its staff, including employees specializing in topics like lead poisoning and HIV. In August, the CDC's director left her post, later telling a Senate committee that she was fired. Her lawyers alleged that she had been “targeted” for refusing to fire CDC staff and “rubber stamp unscientific, reckless directives.” Beyda referred WIRED to the HHS press office, and a spokesperson said Beyda has “never worked for DOGE or DOGE-affiliated parts of the federal government.” The CDC did not respond to a request for comment.

Over the last few months, a handful of DOGE operatives have migrated to a new White House office. In August, Airbnb cofounder Joe Gebbia, who was previously DOGE's lead overhauling the federal retirement system, was appointed as US chief design officer. His new role was established through an executive order that would oversee a new group called the National Design Studio (NDS). According to the order, NDS is tasked with redesigning government web pages and digital services. Gebbia, the White House, and the Executive Office of the President (EOP) did not respond to requests for comment.

NDS is housed within the EOP, just like the US DOGE Service (USDS). In August, WIRED reported that DOGE personnel who had been assigned to the General Services Administration (GSA) would transfer over to NDS. Several of the original DOGE operatives have joined the studio as well, including Coristine, who identifies as a member of the group in the bio of his X account as of last week. Choi cites both DOGE and NDS on his Instagram profile.

Since NDS was created, the office has produced a handful of websites describing White House efforts on issues like health care, immigration, and public safety. The sites, which look more like something from a tech company than the federal government, host information related to programs like the Trump Gold Card and links to apply for law enforcement jobs like the Trump administration's DC task force.

Last week, Coristine and other NDS workers posted on X about their roles in the launch of the Trump administration's “Genesis” AI mission, an Energy Department initiative to build an AI platform for scientific research.

“The video, website, and branding were all made in-house by a group of 3 in a couple weeks,” Coristine posted to X last week. “Apply to have this level of ownership and scale.”

Still, reports of DOGE's collapse continue. Late last month, Reuters reported that DOGE had “disbanded,” citing statements from OPM that the group was no longer a centralized government entity. “The truth is: DOGE may not have centralized leadership under @USDS [United States DOGE Service]. But, the principles of DOGE remain alive and well: de-regulation; eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse; re-shaping the federal workforce; making efficiency a first-class citizen; etc. DOGE catalyzed these changes; the agencies along with @USOPM and @WHOMB will institutionalize them,” Scott Kupor, director of the Office of Personnel Management and former managing partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, said in a statement posted to X late last month.

The X account for DOGE, which regularly posts about contracts the group has cut, posted as well: “As usual, this is fake news from @Reuters. President Trump was given a mandate by the American people to modernize the federal government and reduce waste, fraud and abuse. Just last week, DOGE terminated 78 wasteful contracts and saved taxpayers $335M.”

While some DOGE affiliates have remained in government, others have indeed left for new roles in the private sector, including at Musk-owned and -led companies. In August, Anthony Armstrong, a former investment banker at Morgan Stanley, left DOGE and his post in government at OPM and EOP to join Musk's xAI as its chief financial officer, according to his LinkedIn profile. John Solly, who was part of the DOGE team at the Social Security Administration, now works for Leidos, a major government contractor with projects across several government agencies. Solly and Armstrong did not respond to requests for comment.

In an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast in October, Musk confirmed DOGE's continuity himself. “DOGE is still happening, by the way,” Musk told Rogan. “DOGE is still underway, there is still waste and fraud being cut by the DOGE team.”

“They don't have like a clear person to attack anymore. They applied immense pressure to me to just stop it, so then I'm like, the best thing for me is to just cut out of this,” added Musk. “Now that I'm not in DC, they don't really have a person to attack anymore.”

Despite the apparent confusion over DOGE's continual work and existence in government, DOGE affiliates are proceeding as usual.

In his photo dump on Instagram about his work with DOGE and the government, Choi posted a banner with the phrase: ""We do this not because it is easy, but because we thought it would be easy.” On the banner is a blue handwritten sticky note that reads “and we STILL think its [sic] easy!”

You might think Amazon's biggest swing in the AI race was its $8 billion investment in Anthropic. But AWS has also been building in-house foundation models, new chips, massive data centers, and agents meant to keep enterprise customers locked inside its ecosystem. The company believes these offerings will give it an edge as businesses of all shapes and sizes deploy AI in the real world.

WIRED sat down with AWS CEO Matt Garman ahead of the company's annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas to discuss his AI vision, and how he plans to extend Amazon's lead in the cloud market over its fast-rising competitors, Microsoft and Google.

Garman is betting that AI is a service that AWS can deliver more cheaply and reliably than its rivals. Through Bedrock, Amazon's platform for building AI apps, he says customers can access a variety of AI foundation models while keeping the familiar data controls, security layers, and reliability that AWS is known for. If that pitch holds up, it could help AWS dominate in the AI era.

“Two years ago, people were building AI applications. Now, people are building applications that have AI in them,” said Garman, arguing that AI is becoming a feature inside large products rather than a standalone experiment. “That's the platform that we've built, and that's where I think you see AWS really start to take the lead.”

Many of the announcements at this year's re:Invent fall along these lines. Amazon unveiled new, cost-efficient AI models in its Nova series; agents that can work autonomously on software development and cybersecurity tasks; as well as a fresh offering, Forge, that lets enterprises cheaply train AI models on their own data.

The stakes are high for AWS to get this right. While Amazon's cloud unit dominated the smartphone era, smaller rivals like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure have grown at higher rates since the arrival of ChatGPT. Microsoft and Google have surged by tightly integrating with frontier AI models—the technology underlying ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively—attracting enterprises eager to experiment with cutting-edge capabilities.

This rise of AWS's rivals has raised questions about Amazon's broader AI strategy, and how the incumbent will fare in the years to come.

Garman says he's been hearing these concerns for years, but less so in recent months. He argues that the tide is turning, pointing to AWS's stronger-than-expected results in the company's third quarter as evidence that his strategy is working.

The counter argument to his approach comes from other AI leaders, who believe that AI is a more fundamental shift in computing and will force companies to completely rethink their approach to product development. In a world where AI is a true paradigm shift, cutting-edge AI capabilities may take precedence, and incumbents like AWS could be in a more precarious position.

AI seems to be driving major organizational changes inside of Amazon. In October, the company announced it would lay off 14,000 people as it invests more in AI. Those layoffs came just a few months after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon would need fewer people in certain areas because of AI.

Internally, Garman says that AI tools are significantly accelerating some engineering teams' work as employees shift from writing code themselves to directing a team of AI agents. He says one AWS team recently did a big rewrite of an internal codebase, expecting that it would take 30 people roughly 18 months to complete. With the use of AI, Garman claims the team was able to complete the task with just six people in 71 days.

Some Amazon employees have a less optimistic tone when it comes to the company's embrace of AI. In November, more than 1,000 anonymous Amazon employees signed a petition warning that the company's “aggressive” AI rollout could come at a cost to the environment.

Garman notes that the upside of AI agents are not unlimited—though his focus here is around agent management, not environmental impact.

“Agents are most effective when you ask them to do things that … you actually know how to do yourself,” he said. “So these are not replacements for people. They are ways to make people more effective at their jobs.”

Still, Amazon says the efficiency gains of AI are also making their way to Amazon customers. Reddit was given early access to Amazon's new Forge service, and was able to train an AI model on millions of content moderation decisions, according to AWS. Reddit said the AI model it made with Amazon developed a “social intuition,” and can now help with content moderation for millions of its online communities.

While Amazon is betting big on AI, Garman is skeptical of the exuberance sweeping the broader industry. This year, early stage labs like Mira Murati's Thinking Machines Lab and Ilya Sutskever's Safe Superintelligence nabbed multibillion-dollar investments, despite that they're not yet deploying widely used products.

“When people talk about a bubble, I think those are the deals that are most at risk,” said Garman, referring to AI startups that have raised billion dollar seed rounds. “Where it's a $3 billion valuation for a startup with no lines of code. Maybe, but maybe not. Those are the ones where I think there's open questions.”

But Garman insists that Amazon's AI investments are justified. The company brought on 3.8 gigawatts of new infrastructure capacity in the past 12 months, and just announced an up to $50 billion investment in AI data centers for the US government. Amazon says it's still able to sell off new capacity as soon as it comes online.

“I see the value that so many companies are getting out of AI today, and I don't see that there's any pullback,” said Garman. “They're getting real returns. They're delivering real value to their customers. And so for us, that is a good signal, and we're still in the early stages of what that value is going to be.”

As Silicon Valley continues to chase superintelligence and AGI, AWS seems to be taking a more grounded approach. Whether that's enough to remain king of the cloud providers remains to be seen.

Question for the audience:

With the launch of Gemini 3, I'm hearing a lot of folks in the AI industry say that AI progress hasn't stalled, despite what the skeptics might think. I'd love to hear from Model Behavior readers: What are you doing with AI today that wasn't possible 12 months ago? On the flip side, how is the technology the same (capability-wise) as it was last year? Respond in the comments below or email me—happy to keep things off record.

The United States urgently needs a virtual cybersecurity academy to train cyber defenders for national security, according to the Internet Security Alliance (ISA).

It noted in a recent update to its National Defense Cyber Threat Report that the federal government needs to muster the resolve shown at the end of World War II when the U.S. established the Air Force Academy to ensure the nation had the trained personnel to defend it in the new air theater of operations.

“Today, the United States faces a nearly identical deficiency — this time with respect to digital conflict,” the ISA asserted. “The nation, including every critical infrastructure sector, is under constant cyberattack from well-financed nation-states, and we lack an adequate number of trained personnel required to defend both government and private-sector systems.”

It explained that despite high investment in cybersecurity, the workforce deficit is overwhelming, with 500,000 to 750,000 cybersecurity vacancies nationwide, including 35,000 unfilled positions in the federal government.

“The United States must respond with the same urgency shown after World War II,” it argued. “While there are some government programs to promote cybersecurity training in return for government service, as would the virtual academy, they are far too small. We need to address the problem at scale.”

The ISA outlined a plan by which academy graduates would be paid at a level similar to that of West Point and Annapolis graduates during their required government service.

Those salaries are far lower than the ones paid to independent contractors to do those jobs. The difference between what the government pays academy graduates and what it pays independent contractors is so significant that it would cover the full cost of training them. Essentially, this is free cybersecurity for the federal government, the ISA reasoned.

Moreover, it added, once the academy graduates complete their government service, they will likely enter cybersecurity jobs in the private sector, where they will continue to defend our nation against nation-state attacks.

Funding for the academy could come through the Cyber PIVOTT Act, a proposed law currently before Congress that aims to train 10,000 cyber recruits a year for government positions, the ISA explained.

“At Darktrace, we see firsthand the pressing need for a stronger cybersecurity workforce,” said Marcus Fowler, CEO of Darktrace Federal, a global cybersecurity AI company. There are massive numbers of unfilled cybersecurity roles across the United States, leaving businesses and government agencies vulnerable.

“The recent PIVOTT Act is a critical step toward closing this gap by creating smarter workforce development pathways, expanding access to hands-on training, and building a skills-based cybersecurity talent pipeline that meets the demands of today's economy,” he told TechNewsWorld.

However, Fowler added, to achieve that goal, we'll also need to ensure that security teams are trained on the most advanced tools so that technology can fulfill its potential to augment the workforce and act as a true force multiplier.

“We believe that a smarter federal cyber workforce policy, when combined with greater adoption of AI-powered cybersecurity technologies, marks the best path forward toward meeting America's skills and capabilities needs and building a more resilient national cyber defense,” he said.

David Kertai, a research assistant with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a science and technology think tank in Washington, D.C., maintained that it is clear that federal, state, and local governments across the U.S. need more cybersecurity professionals to prepare for and respond to the growing number of cyber threats and attacks.

For example, he noted, the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service program provides scholarships in exchange for service in federal cybersecurity positions. “While this program is a step in the right direction, it should be expanded,” he told TechNewsWorld. A virtual cybersecurity academy could complement the CyberCorps program by connecting individuals with existing educational institutions to complete their degrees and enter the cybersecurity workforce.

A virtual cybersecurity academy could be valuable, but only if it avoids the pitfalls that have made other federal training programs ineffective, contended Morgan Peirce, a research assistant in the technology and national security program of the Center for New American Security, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank focused on U.S. national security and defense policy.

“The U.S. already operates several major cyber training programs, including CyberCorps SFS, NSA's Centers of Academic Excellence, and various agency initiatives — and these programs are resource-constrained and structurally fragmented,” she told TechNewsWorld. This new virtual academy would need to fill specific gaps lacking in existing programs.

“Adding a new program, rather than expanding existing programs, may fragment funding further,” she said. While the virtual element increases convenience, it will be important not to sacrifice training that requires an in-person element.

If an academy were established, it would need to rethink current pedagogical approaches to information security. The traditional cybersecurity education model cannot scale to address the roughly 500,000 unfilled positions in the U.S. alone, contended Michael Bell, CEO of Suzu Testing, a provider of AI-powered cybersecurity services, in Las Vegas.

“A virtual academy removes geographic barriers while enabling hands-on training through virtual labs and simulated threat exercises that can actually be more effective than traditional classroom lectures,” he told TechNewsWorld.

The risk is that these training pipelines become certificate mills rather than genuine educational institutions, so any national academy must have rigorous standards, real-world capstone requirements, and employer validation to ensure graduates are actually qualified to defend critical systems, he said.

Bell envisioned the academy combining asynchronous coursework with live virtual labs, mentorship from practicing professionals, and real-world capstone projects with government and private-sector partners.

Think of a hybrid model, he observed, with a foundational curriculum covering network security, incident response, threat intelligence, and secure architecture, paired with specialization tracks: offensive security, cloud security, OT/ICS security, and AI security.

Critically, it needs partnerships with employers who commit to hiring graduates, creating a direct pipeline from education to employment, he added. The military's existing virtual training infrastructure could serve as a foundation — although it would need to be vastly improved, scaled for civilian use, and integrated with community college credentialing programs, like those in the PIVOTT Act.

Any academy should require hands-on training in large simulated corporate environments and guidance from senior professionals who would instruct and exercise the trainees, advised Ian Amit, founder and CEO of Gomboc, a provider of automated cloud infrastructure security solutions, in New York City.

“The key elements of the work a cybersecurity professional does involve tight coordination with other stakeholders,” he told TechNewsWorld. It's not about proficiency with specific tools or languages, but more about experience working on incidents and coordinating response.

However, Amit argued that we don't need more entry-level workers in the cybersecurity industry. It's already overflowing with those who have a hard time breaking into the workforce — especially as more advanced tooling is offered to help fill the tasks performed by entry-level workers.

This seems to be a government view on the macroeconomy. While skilled professionals are in short supply, initiatives that provide virtual education to fill entry-level roles are simply misguided, he maintained.

While it's absolutely the case that there is a major cyber professional and workforce pipeline deficit which is problematic, given escalating cyber tensions and incursions from adversaries sponsored or supported indirectly by Iran, Russia, North Korea and China, training alone can't solve the deficit problem, added Jeff Le, managing principal at 100 Mile Strategies, a government affairs and emerging technologies consulting firm in Washington, D.C.

There needs to be a concerted investment and specific matchmaking to reduce the certification glut and emphasize skills-based expertise and apprenticeship models, he told TechNewsWorld.

The ISA's emphasis on national cybersecurity as a shared public-private responsibility is spot-on, noted Rosario Mastrogiacomo, chief strategy officer at Sphere Technology Solutions, a data governance software and services company, in Hoboken, N.J.

“But workforce challenges won't be solved with policy alone,” he told TechNewsWorld. “We need scalable, sustainable infrastructure for continuous learning, better alignment between compliance and real risk reduction, and tools that enable security teams to focus on prevention, not paperwork.”

“The ISA report is a wake-up call,” added Ensar Seker, CISO of SOCRadar, a threat intelligence company, in Newark, Del. “It reframes cybersecurity not as a cost center or an IT silo but as a pillar of national strength,” he told TechNewsWorld.

We need systemic reforms, yes, but we also need to humanize the workforce challenge, he continued. Burnout, fragmentation, and talent bottlenecks are solvable, but only if we treat cyber professionals not just as defenders, but as strategic assets worth investing in.

Nuclear power company TerraPower has passed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff's final safety evaluation for a permit to build a reactor in Wyoming. The Washington-based company backed by Bill Gates and NVIDIA could be the first to deploy a utility-scale, next-generation reactor in America.

TerraPower's Natrium design pairs a small modular reactor (SMR) with an integrated thermal battery. The SMR generates 345 megawatts of continuous electrical power. The thermal battery, which stores excess heat in molten salt, allows the system to surge its output to 500 megawatts for more than five hours, generating enough energy to power 400,000 homes at maximum capacity.

“Today is a momentous occasion for TerraPower, our project partners and the Natrium design,” said company CEO Chris Levesque in a statement issued Monday. The favorable assessment “reflects years of rigorous evaluation, thoughtful collaboration with the NRC, and an unwavering commitment to both safety and innovation.”

The company launched in 2006 and is building on technology used in an experimental breeder reactor in Idaho that operated for nearly 30 years before shutting down. 

TerraPower set a goal of producing power at the Kemmerer, Wyo., site by 2030. The reactor is located near a retiring coal plant. 

There is tremendous renewed interest in nuclear as tech giants and data center operators scramble for new energy sources to power AI operations. Microsoft, Amazon and others have invested in a combination of existing nuclear plants that can be restarted and construction of new facilities. The Trump administration has pledged to expedite permitting.  

“We've finished our technical work on the Kemmerer review a month ahead of our already accelerated schedule, as we aim to make licensing decisions for new, advanced reactors in no more than 18 months,” said Jeremy Groom, acting director of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. 

“We thank TerraPower for promptly addressing the agency's questions to ensure safety and enable the NRC to efficiently process the application,” he added in a statement. 

The NRC said there are no safety aspects that would preclude issuing a construction permit for the reactor. TerraPower last year broke ground in Wyoming on non-nuclear components of the facility. 

In June the company announced $650 million in new funding from Gates, who helped start TerraPower, as well as the venture arm of chip giant NVIDIA. It previously raised more than $1 billion, including investments from Gates as well as South Korea-based SK Inc. and SK Innovation, according to PitchBook. TerraPower has additionally been awarded roughly $2 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy.

There are still additional permitting hurdles to complete:

— Smartsheet's C-suite shuffle continues with the hiring of Scott Torrey as chief revenue officer. 

Torrey previously led salary data company Payscale as CEO from 2019 to 2021. He spent the past three years as executive chairman at finance software startup Tesorio, and was at Concur for nearly two decades, including six years as chief revenue officer. 

His new role marks a reunion of sorts as he teams up again with Concur co-founder Rajeev Singh, who recently became CEO at Smartsheet. 

“Smartsheet is on a growth trajectory, and Scott's leadership will drive our go-to-market success,” Singh said in a press release. 

Smartsheet earlier this year hired Pratima Arora as its chief product officer and Ravi Soin as chief information security officer. It also named Cynthia Tee as chief technology officer.

Founded two decades ago, Smartsheet is one of the Seattle region's iconic tech companies, with a large customer base of major businesses and more than $1 billion in annual revenue. It went private earlier this year in a $8.4 billion deal with Vista Equity Partners and Blackstone.

Speaking to the company's annual Engage conference in Seattle last month, Singh said it's time for Smartsheet to “step out of the shadows” and challenge old perceptions of Smartsheet as simply an online spreadsheet tool. The company recently announced new features as part of its “Intelligent Work Management” platform that combines AI agents, knowledge graphs, and automation. 

— Amar Subramanya, a top AI researcher who joined Microsoft in July as a corporate VP, is changing jobs again and joining Apple as vice president of AI.

Subramanya will report to Craig Federighi, Apple's vice president of software engineering, the tech giant announced Monday. He'll lead Apple Foundation Models, ML research, and AI Safety and Evaluation.

Apple also announced that John Giannandrea, Apple's senior vice president for Machine Learning and AI Strategy, is stepping down. 

Before joining Microsoft, Subramanya was at Google for more than 16 years, where he helped lead work on Gemini. He earned his Ph.D. at the University of Washington in 2009 and was a visiting researcher at Microsoft for a year in the mid-2000s.

“AI has long been central to Apple's strategy, and we are pleased to welcome Amar to Craig's leadership team and to bring his extraordinary AI expertise to Apple,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a press release. 

Apple has struggled to catch up with competitors in the AI race and recently delayed a new version of its Siri voice assistant.

— Torben Severson left Amazon after 17 years to take a new role as vice president and head of global business development at OpenAI. Severson held multiple business development leadership roles, most recently as chief of staff to Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores.

“Joining OpenAI at such a defining moment in technology is an opportunity I couldn't pass up,” Severson said in a LinkedIn post. “I'm drawn to moments of transformation — and it's rare to be part of something so squarely at the frontier of what's possible.”

Severson said he was the first person to join “what became Corporate Business Development” at Amazon in 2008. “I'm deeply grateful for the people I've learned from and worked alongside,” he wrote. “Amazon shaped how I think, taught me how to navigate complex problems, and gave me the opportunity to build and lead exceptional teams. Through those experiences I learned the value of high judgment, clarity in ambiguity, and building trust through curiosity and rigor.”

OpenAI, based in San Francisco, said last year that it opened an office in Bellevue, Wash. The company recently acquired Bellevue-based startup Statsig.

Editor's note: This series profiles six of the Seattle region's “Uncommon Thinkers”: inventors, scientists, technologists and entrepreneurs transforming industries and driving positive change in the world. They will be recognized Dec. 11 at the GeekWire Gala. Uncommon Thinkers is presented in partnership with Greater Seattle Partners.

Plenty of startup founders and product builders envision what they're making as something that will simplify processes or improve workflow for customers. Kiana Ehsani sees her creation as a means to spending more time outdoors.

Certainly there's much more to it than that, but when Ehsani — the co-founder and CEO of Seattle AI startup Vercept — is running an ultramarathon, climbing up a mountain or skiing down one, she can't help but consider how her technology makes it all the more enjoyable.

“I'm just the happiest when I'm in nature, when I'm not behind my computer, letting my mind be present in the moment, listening to the steps of my foot on the trail, or on snow or ice,” Ehsani said.

It's what motivated her and her colleagues at Vercept to build Vy, an AI product that “sees” and understands computer screens like a human would. It records a user performing tasks across different software or websites — and then autonomously runs the same workflow from a natural language command.

The idea is to use AI to automate repetitive tasks, like entering data, producing video content, organizing invoices, and more. And Ehsani said Vy makes it so not everyone needs to know how to work so many specialized software programs.

“I don't want to become skilled in every single dimension that exists out there,” she said. “The more time you're not spending on repetitive work that is not using your brain power, then the more time you have to be creative.”

Ehsani's goal is to be able to send emails or check code and Slack messages when she's somewhere in nature without good internet service. Vy handles the tasks on its own and reports back about what it completed.

“I am most creative when I'm on a hike,” she said. “If I could just have that more often, to be able to have that creative mind, flowing and producing more, and I didn't have to be stuck behind the desk, then the world would be my playground.”

Ehsani's journey to AI innovator and Seattle startup founder started in Iran, where she lived until she graduated from Sharif University. She ranked 64th in the country's University Entrance Exam.

“I was a geek,” she said. “I was publishing papers as an undergrad, and I would go and give talks at conferences internationally, and I was so proud of what I was doing.”

She came to the U.S. in 2015 to get her Master's and PhD in computer science at the University of Washington. 

“Within the first year I realized, ‘Oh, there's a lot of possibility in AI and I want to get more involved,'” Ehsani said.

After internships at Google and Meta, she joined Seattle's Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) where she spent four years, overseeing the Ai2 robotics and embodied artificial intelligence teams as a senior researcher.

At the end of 2024, Ehsani launched Vercept alongside Oren Etzioni, the longtime AI specialist and UW professor who was founding CEO of Ai2. They were joined by Matt Deitke, Luca Weihs, and Ross Girshick.

Etzioni said that while some people are “all heart” — good people with high emotional intelligence — or “all brain” — smart, sharp and cerebral — it's rare to find someone who is both. Ehsani, who he called brilliant, dedicated and intuitive, is that person.

“One uncommon thing about Kiana is how she has repeatedly transformed herself,” Etzioni said via email. “From a brilliant theoretician in Iran to a creative and award-winning vision and robotics researcher at UW and Ai2, to kick-ass founder and CEO now. And the best is yet to come!”

Ehsani remembers being frustrated and bored by the challenges that AI was being tasked to solve, such as simple image classification, just 10 years ago. She wanted to solve real problems and show that AI could interact with the real world.

That mindset drove her interest in computer vision and robotics research. But again, she grew frustrated by the slow pace of hardware development and decided she wanted to work with AI models and virtual robots that take actions on behalf of a user.

Growing up in Iran she had become accustomed to limited resources. Working in academia and then in research for a nonprofit, she again had to think outside the box and find ways to compete against big AI labs. 

She still embraces a scrappy startup mentality as Vercept competes against OpenAI (Operator), Google (Project Mariner), Amazon (Nova Act), and others with tools that automate tasks across browsers and apps, fueled by advances in generative AI.

“That's the mindset that made me grow more, and that's why at Vercept we are training models a lot more efficiently and less resource-heavy than anyone out there,” she said. “We love being scrappy and proving that you don't need billions and trillions of dollars to make AI work.”

Just this week, Vercept launched a newly built version of Vy that works on both Windows and MacOS. Ehsani said the app is more robust and Vercept's benchmark results have improved drastically.

The startup has grown to a team of 12 and in June raised a $16 million seed round. In July, Ehsani lost Deitke, one of her co-founders, who was lured by Meta to join its newly formed Superintelligence Lab.

Deitke called Ehsani “an incredible leader and visionary” whose strong background in robotics makes her extremely well suited for working at the frontier of computer use, which he said is really just robotics without many of the challenges of the physical world.

“Working with her is infectious and inspiring,” Deitke said. “She has an incredible work ethic and is constantly energized and comes up with amazing ideas while brainstorming that only become obvious to the rest of us after a while.”

But he said more than anything, Ehsani's a “tremendous person” who leaves a lasting mark with her kindness and ambition. 

“She's truly an exceptional person,” Deitke said.

Several weeks ago, Ehsani was challenging herself in nature yet again, this time with a 50k ultramarathon that featured 8,000 feet of elevation gain. 

Freezing, thirsty, and dragging herself up a hill, she likened the race to running a startup, writing on LinkedIn about how despite everything going wrong and plans changing last minute, she still had to stay flexible and believe she'd make it, even when others seemed ahead.

“That's the story of my life,” she told GeekWire. “I live that every day.”

Seattle biotech startup Curi Bio, which enables the screening of new drugs using cells and 3D tissue models derived from human cells, announced $10 million in new funding. 

Curi Bio's customers include large biopharmaceutical and biotech companies such Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Astrazeneca, Pfizer, Boehringer Ingelheim, UCB, Novartis and others. Its Series B round was led by Seoul-based DreamCIS, which supports biopharma R&D through extensive research services.

“We are thrilled to partner with DreamCIS, who shares our conviction that drug discovery urgently needs more human-relevant data at the preclinical stage,” said Michael Cho, Curi Bio's chief strategy officer, in a statement. “The vast majority of new drugs fail in human clinical trials because preclinical animal and 2D cell models have failed to be good predictors of human outcomes.”

Curi Bio's platform integrates bioengineered tissues created from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with data collection and analysis. The additional funding will expedite its development of new platforms for cardiac, skeletal muscle, metabolic, smooth muscle and neuromuscular diseases, the company said. 

The Seattle area is a hub of life science and biotech companies, including numerous efforts focused on AI-assisted research. Researchers have emphasized the need to test computer-generated drug candidates in the lab to verify their capabilities and impacts.

“Curi Bio's unique integration of cells, systems, and data is a paradigm shift for preclinical drug discovery,” said Jeounghee Yoo, CEO of DreamCIS. “We were incredibly impressed by the company's innovative platforms and their ability to generate functional data from 3D human tissues at scale.”

Curi Bio has raised more than $32 million from investors and $12 million from federal grants. 

The company spun out of the University of Washington a decade ago as NanoSurface Biomedical. In April, Curi Bio celebrated the opening of its new 13,942-square-foot headquarters and research facility on the Seattle waterfront.

Yoodli is on a roll. 

The Seattle startup, which sells AI-powered software to help people practice real-world conversations such as sales calls and feedback sessions, announced a $40 million Series B round on Tuesday to fuel growth. WestBridge Capital, a $7 billion global investment firm, led the round. 

The fresh funding comes less than a year after the company's $13.7 million Series A round in May. 

Yoodli's software lets users create personas to simulate conversations with another person or multiple people. The company's model is trained on effective communication techniques and can be customized depending on an organization's goals. Customers include SAP, Google, Snowflake, the University of Washington, Korn Ferry, and others. 

“At a moment when AI is replacing human jobs, we're doubling down on a different belief: that AI should help people become the best version of themselves in the conversations that matter most,” co-founder and CEO Varun Puri wrote on LinkedIn. 

Yoodli's revenue has grown around 900% in the past year. Its headcount has tripled to more than 40 people.

Puri told GeekWire earlier this year that Yoodli is like a “batting cage before game time,” or a flight simulator for communication. The idea is to replace passive formats such as slide decks and training videos with interactive practice that builds conversational muscle memory.

The company said it will use the new funding to expand into what it calls “experiential learning.”

“Experiential learning is the next step of conversation coaching — helping people learn, practice, and apply skills with roleplays at the center of their experience,” Puri wrote. “We're making learning more fun and actionable for individuals and much more closely tied to ROI for organizations.”

The raise comes amid competition in the AI-powered workforce training market, as employers look for tools to upskill workers in communication, leadership, and customer engagement — areas where traditional learning management systems may have limitations.

Puri and Esha Joshi launched Yoodli in 2021 at the AI2 incubator in Seattle. The startup got off the ground with a consumer-focused offering targeted at practicing public speaking. 

Neotribe and Madrona also participated in the latest funding round. Total capital raised is nearly $60 million.

LAS VEGAS — Amazon is pitching a future where AI works while humans sleep, announcing a collection of what it calls “frontier agents” capable of handling complex, multi-day projects without needing a human to be constantly involved.

The announcement Tuesday at the Amazon Web Services re:Invent conference is an attempt by the cloud giant to leapfrog Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, OpenAI, and others as the industry moves beyond interactive AI assistants toward fully autonomous digital workers.

The rollout features three specialized agents: A virtual developer for Amazon's Kiro coding platform that navigates multiple code repositories to fix bugs; a security agent that actively tests applications for vulnerabilities; and a DevOps agent that responds to system outages. 

Unlike standard AI chatbots that reset after each session, Amazon says the frontier agents have long-term memory and can work for hours or days to solve ambiguous problems.

“You could go to sleep and wake up in the morning, and it's completed a bunch of tasks,” said Deepak Singh, AWS vice president of developer agents and experiences, in an interview. 

Amazon is starting with the agents focused on software development, but Singh made it clear that it's just the beginning of a larger long-term rollout of similar agents. 

“The term is broad,” he said. “It can be applied in many, many domains.”

During the opening keynote Tuesday morning, AWS CEO Matt Garman said believes AI agents represent an “inflection point” in AI development, transforming AI from a “technical wonder” into something that delivers real business value.

In the future, Garman said, “there's going to be millions of agents inside of every company across every imaginable field.”

To keep frontier agents from breaking critical systems, Amazon says humans remain the gatekeepers. The DevOps agent stops short of making fixes automatically, instead generating a detailed “mitigation plan” that an engineer approves. The Kiro developer agent submits its work as proposed pull requests, ensuring a human reviews the code before it's merged.

Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic and others are all moving in a similar direction. Microsoft's GitHub Copilot is becoming a multi-agent system, Google is adding autonomous features to Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude Code is designed to handle extended coding tasks. 

Amazon is announcing the frontier agents during the opening keynote by AWS CEO Matt Garman at re:Invent, its big annual conference. The DevOps and security agents are available in public preview starting Tuesday; the Kiro developer agent will roll out in the coming months.

Some of the other notable announcements at re:Invent today:

AI Factories: AWS will ship racks of its servers directly to customer data centers to run as a private “AI Factory,” in its words. This matters for governments and banks, for example, that want modern AI tools but are legally restricted from moving sensitive data off-premises.

New AI Models: Amazon announced Nova 2, the next generation of the generative AI models it first unveiled here a year ago. They include a “Pro” model for complex reasoning, a “Sonic” model for natural voice conversations, and a new “Omni” model that processes text, audio, and video simultaneously.

Custom Models: Amazon introduced Nova Forge, a tool that lets companies build their own high-end AI models from scratch by combining their private data with Amazon's own datasets. It's designed for businesses that find standard models too generic but lack the resources to build one entirely alone.

Trainium: Amazon released its newest home-grown AI processor, Trainium 3, which it says is roughly 4x faster and 40% more efficient than the previous version. It's central to Amazon's strategy to lower the cost of training AI and provide a cheaper alternative to Nvidia GPUs. Executives also previewed Trainium 4, promising to double energy efficiency again.

Killing “Tech Debt”: AWS expanded its Transform service to rewrite and modernize code from basically any source, including proprietary languages. The tool uses AI agents to analyze and convert these custom legacy systems into modern languages, a process Amazon claims is up to five times faster than manual coding.

Amazon has announced it's launching a new service that completes deliveries in 30 minutes or less in Seattle and Philadelphia. The new “ultra-fast” delivery option will allow Amazon to better compete with services like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Instacart.

Customers will be able to order a range of different items, including milk, eggs, fresh produce, toothpaste, cosmetics, pet treats, diapers, paper products, electronics, seasonal items, over-the-counter medicines, chips, dips, and more, according to the company.

Prime members can choose the fast delivery option for a $3.99 fee per order, while non-Prime members will have to pay $13.99. Orders below $15 will include a small-basket fee of $1.99.

Customers in Seattle and Philadelphia can now check the Amazon app and homepage and look for the “30-Minute Delivery” option in the navigation bar to see if it's available in their area. 

After placing an order, customers can track their deliveries and tip drivers through the app. 

“Amazon is utilizing specialized smaller facilities designed for efficient order fulfillment, strategically placed close to where Seattle- and Philadelphia-area customers live and work,” Amazon explained in a blog post. “This approach prioritizes the safety of employees picking and packing orders, reduces the distance delivery partners need to travel, and enables faster delivery times.”

The move follows Amazon's launch of a 15-minute delivery service in the United Arab Emirates in October. The company said at the time that some customers received their orders in as little as six minutes.

The launch of the new service marks Amazon's latest effort to enter the fast delivery market in the United States. In 2014, the e-commerce giant introduced a “Prime Now” service that offered one-hour deliveries, but the company discontinued it in 2021.

Amazon has been working to expand its delivery options and announced in June that it plans to invest more than $4 billion to triple the size of its delivery network by 2026.

ChatGPT's unwelcome suggestion for a Peloton app during a conversation led to some backlash from OpenAI customers. People feared that ads had arrived, even for paid customers. OpenAI, however, clarified that the app suggestion was not an advertisement, but instead a poor attempt to integrate an app discovery feature within conversations.

In a post on X, which has since been viewed nearly 462,000 times, AI startup Hyberbolic's co-founder, Yuchen Jin, shared a screenshot where ChatGPT seemingly suggested connecting the Peloton app in an unrelated conversation. Worse still, Jin noted he was a paid subscriber to ChatGPT's $200 per month Pro Plan. At that price point, ads would not be expected. 

The post, which was reshared and saved hundreds of times across X, received quite a bit of attention, as it seemed to indicate OpenAI was testing the insertion of ads into its paid product. Users complained that paying customers, especially, shouldn't have to see app suggestions like this.

One person also pointed out that they couldn't get ChatGPT to stop recommending Spotify to them, even though they were an Apple Music subscriber. 

Hey, Kol. Thanks for flagging 🙏 This is not an ad (there's no financial component). It's only a suggestion to install Peloton's app. But the lack of relevancy makes it a bad/confusing experience. We're iterating on the suggestions and UX, trying to make sure they're awesome.

OpenAI's data lead for ChatGPT, Daniel McAuley, later jumped into the thread to clarify that the Peloton placement was not an ad; it was “only a suggestion to install Peloton's app.” He said there was “no financial component” to the appearance of the app suggestion. 

However, he admitted that “the lack of relevancy” to the conversation made it a bad and confusing experience, and OpenAI was iterating on the suggestions and the user experience.

A company spokesperson also confirmed to TechCrunch that what users had spotted was one of the ways OpenAI had been “testing surfacing apps in ChatGPT conversations.” They pointed to OpenAI's announcement in October about its new app platform, where the company noted that apps would “fit naturally” into user conversations. 

“You can discover [apps] when ChatGPT suggests one at the right time, or by calling them by name. Apps respond to natural language and include interactive interfaces you can use right in the chat,” the post explained. 

But that didn't appear to be the case here, as the user claims they weren't discussing anything related to health and fitness. Instead, as the screenshot shows, they had been chatting with the AI about a podcast featuring Elon Musk, where xAI was the topic being discussed. Inserting Peloton into this experience was unhelpful and a distraction. 

Yet even if the app suggestion had been relevant, users may have still viewed it as an ad, given that it's directing people to a product from a business that isn't free. In addition, users can't turn off these app suggestions, which may make them feel more intrusive.  

This user sentiment could have potential ramifications for OpenAI's desire to replace the App Store experience, and apps that run on your phone, with integrated apps that run within ChatGPT. If users don't want to see app suggestions, they could choose to switch to a competitor's chatbot to avoid them.

Currently, ChatGPT apps are available to logged-in users outside of the EU, Switzerland, and the U.K., and the integrations are still in pilot testing. OpenAI partners with a number of app makers, including Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Zillow, and others.

French AI startup Mistral launched its new Mistral 3 family of open-weight models on Tuesday, a launch that aims to prove it can lead in making AI publicly available and serve business clients better than Big Tech rivals.The 10-model release includes a large frontier model with multimodal and multilingual capabilities and nine smaller offline-capable, fully customizable models. 

The launch comes as Mistral, which develops open-weight language models and Europe-focused AI chatbot Le Chat, has appeared to be playing catch up with some of Silicon Valley's closed-source frontier models. Open-weight models release their model weights publicly so anyone can download and run them. Meanwhile, closed-source models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, keep their weights proprietary and only provide access through APIs or controlled interfaces.

The two-year-old startup, founded by former DeepMind and Meta researchers, has raised about $2.7 billion to date at a $13.7 billion valuation — peanuts compared to the numbers that competitors like OpenAI ($57 billion raised at a $500 billion valuation) and Anthropic ($45 billion raised at a $350 billion valuation) are pulling.

But Mistral is trying to prove that bigger isn't always better — especially for enterprise use cases. 

“Our customers are sometimes happy to start with a very large [closed] model that they don't have to fine-tune … but when they deploy it, they realize it's expensive, it's slow,” Guillaume Lample, co-founder and chief scientist at Mistral, told TechCrunch. “Then they come to us to fine-tune small models to handle the use case [more efficiently].” 

“In practice, the huge majority of enterprise use cases are things that can be tackled by small models, especially if you fine-tune them,” Lample continued. 

Initial benchmark comparisons, which place Mistral's smaller models well behind its closed-source competitors, can be misleading, Lample said. Large closed-source models may perform better out-of-the-box, but the real gains happen when you customize. 

“In many cases, you can actually match or even out-perform closed-source models,” he said.

Mistral's large frontier model, dubbed Mistral Large 3, catches up to some of the important capabilities that larger closed-source AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4o and Google's Gemini 2 boast, while also trading blows with several open-weight competitors. Large 3 is among the first open frontier models with multimodal and multilingual capabilities all in one, putting it on par with Meta's Llama 3 and Alibaba's Qwen3-Omni. Many other companies currently pair impressive large language models with separate smaller multi-modal models, something Mistral has done previously with models like Pixtral and Mistral Small 3.1.

Large 3 also features a “granular Mixture of Experts” architecture with 41 billion active parameters and 675 billion total parameters, enabling efficient reasoning across a 256,000 context window. This design delivers both speed and capability, allowing it to process lengthy documents and function as an agentic assistant for complex enterprise tasks. Mistral positions Large 3 as suitable for document analysis, coding, content creation, AI assistants, and workflow automation.

With its new family of small models, dubbed Ministral 3, the company is making the bold claim that smaller models aren't just sufficient – they're superior. 

The lineup includes nine distinct, high-performance dense models across three sizes (14 billion, 8 billion, and 3 billion parameters) and three variants: Base (the pre-trained foundation model), Instruct (chat-optimized for conversation and assistant-style workflows), and Reasoning (optimized for complex logic and analytical tasks).

Mistral says this range gives developers and businesses the flexibility to match models to their exact performance, whether they're after raw performance, cost efficiency, or specialized capabilities. The company claims Ministral 3 scores on par or better than other open-weight leaders while being more efficient and generating fewer tokens for equivalent tasks. All variants support vision, handle 128,000-256,000 context windows, and work across languages.

A major part of the pitch is practicality. Lample emphasizes that Ministral 3 can run on a single GPU, making it deployable on affordable hardware — from on-premise servers to laptops, robots, and other edge devices that may have limited connectivity. That matters not only for enterprises keeping data in-house, but also for students seeking feedback offline or robotics teams operating in remote environments. Greater efficiency, Lample argues, translates directly to broader accessibility. 

“It's part of our mission to be sure that AI is accessible to everyone, especially people without internet access,” he said. “We don't want AI to be controlled by only a couple of big labs.”

Some other companies are pursuing similar efficiency trade-offs: Cohere's latest enterprise model, Command A, also runs on just two GPUs, and its AI agent platform North can run on just one GPU. 

That sort of accessibility is driving Mistral's growing physical AI focus. Earlier this year, the company began working to integrate its smaller models into robots, drones, and vehicles. Mistral is collaborating with Singapore's Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) on specialized models for robots, cybersecurity systems, and fire safety; with German defense tech startup Helsing on vision-language-action models for drones; and with automaker Stellantis on an in-car AI assistant.

For Mistral, reliability and independence are just as critical as performance.

“Using an API from our competitors that will go down for half an hour every two weeks — if you're a big company, you cannot afford this,” Lample said.

Simular, a startup building AI agents for Mac OS and Windows, has raised a $21.5 million Series A led by Felicis, with  NVentures (Nvidia's venture arm), existing seed investor South Park Commons, and others joining in.  

Simular is an interesting agentic startup because unlike others, it isn't trying to control the browser but the PC itself. (Agentic AI refers to systems that can autonomously complete complex tasks with minimal human intervention.) “We can literally move the mouse on the screen and do the click. So it's more capable of doing, repeating whatever human activities in the digital world,” co-founder CEO Ang Li told TechCrunch, offering the example of copying and pasting data into a spreadsheet. 

On Monday it announced the release of its 1.0 version for Mac OS. But it's also working with Microsoft to develop an agent for Windows. The startup is one of five agentic companies accepted into the Windows 365 for Agents program Microsoft announced in mid November. (The others are Manus AI, Fellou, Genspark, and TinyFish.) As for the timeline for the Windows version, Li was vague except to say it promises to be as or more popular than the Mac version. 

Another reason to watch Simular is the bona fides of the founders: Li is a continuous learning scientist who previously worked at Google's DeepMind, where he met his co-founder, reinforcement learning specialist Jiachen Yang. While their team published their fair share of papers, the work wasn't strictly academic, Li said. It was intended to improve Google products, including Waymo. 

That AI product background is helpful because, before the agentic future of Silicon Valley's dreams can materialize, there are a host of technical problems to solve. One of the biggest is that LLMs hallucinate some percentage of the time.

Agentic tasks can require completing thousands to millions of discrete steps. Not only can a hallucination at any single step invalidate all of the agent's work, but hallucinations become statistically more likely as the number of steps grows.  

One way to solve this is to make the “non deterministic” LLM “deterministic,” meaning instead of allowing the LLM to be endlessly creative, its responses or actions are scripted the same each time. But that risks limiting the whole creative problem-solving aspect of an agent.

Simular is marrying the two. Its agent will iterate freely on the task, with the human user in the middle course correcting, until the agent achieves success. Then the human locks in that task's workflow, which makes it deterministic, repeatable. 

“Our solution is, let agents keep exploring the successful trajectory. Once you found a successful trajectory, that becomes deterministic code,” Li explains. 

The reason the startup can do this is because its work — which Li admits is still early — is not just an LLM wrapper that sends and retrieves data to a model.

“We have a new technology which is not used by any other agent company. We call it ‘neuro symbolic computer use agents.' It's not fully LLM-based,” he said. “Our approach to solve hallucinations is to let the LLM write code which becomes deterministic. So if you have a workflow that works, the next time we run the same workflow, it'll be successful as well.”  

Another benefit is that this deterministic code that performs a repeatable task is in the hands of the end user, not the LLM. “Once they have the code, they can trust it, because they can inspect it, they can audit it, they can see what's going on,” Li says.

Time will tell if this method is the magic that will bring agents into the hands of every worker. Li says his early beta customers include a car dealership automating VIN number searches, and HOAs extracting contract information from PDFs. And the company's open source project (available only for Mac OS at the moment) has led to automations ranging from content creation to sales and marketing.  

Simular previously raised a $5 million seed, bringing its total raised to about $27 million. Other investors in the company include Basis Set Ventures, Flying Fish Partners, Samsung NEXT, Xoogler Ventures, and podcaster and angel investor Lenny Rachitsky, the company says.

Apple announced on Tuesday that it's rolling out Apple Music Replay, its answer to Spotify's popular Wrapped feature. Apple Music Replay gives users a look back at their year in music by highlighting their top songs, artists, and albums they streamed. 

This year, the feature includes even more listening habits, including “Discovery,” which highlights new artists users listened to, and “Loyalty,” which spotlights artists that users have kept coming back to each year. Additionally, “Comebacks” highlights artists who made a return to users' listening rotation.

Users will also be able to see their total minutes listened to on the streaming service, the total number of artists they listened to, their longest artist streak, favorite genres, and more.

Apple Music Replay dashboard can be accessed via the Home tab on the music streaming service. 

In addition to the yearly Replay, users can revisit their monthly Replay highlights and view yearly summaries from each year they've been on Apple Music. They can also listen to their “Replay All Time” playlist to hear the songs they've played the most since joining the service.

As for artists, they will get access to new metrics such as listenership growth and year-over-year performance summaries. As with previous years, they'll be able to see metrics like total listeners, countries, cities, and minutes.

Apple also announced that the top song of 2025 on Apple Music is ROSÉ and Bruno Mars' “APT.” Kendrick Lamar and SZA followed in second place with “luther.” Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars rounded out the top three with “Die With A Smile.” Fourth place went to Kendrick Lamar's “Not Like Us,” and Billie Eilish took fifth place with “Birds of a Feather.”

Apple Music's Replay comes a week after YouTube launched its 2025 Recaps and the same day that Amazon Music released its own yearly recaps. The companies' year-end features have arrived ahead of Spotify's — likely in the hopes of getting the jump on music-related social media sharing.

However, if you did want it to be nix all the way down and get more of that juicy dependency granularity, it could be more of a model where content and templates are transformed upfront into Nix source, which is then transformed and combined during evaluation. Obviously this is fairly slow in an IFD world where all that pre-work has to be serialized, but it would be interesting to experiment with what it looks like in a dynamic derivations context.

After using Nix for a while I got pretty fed up with the (subjective) unintuitiveness of the language†. It wasn't even that I thought it was a bad language, I just couldn't het it to click (and doubly so after the advent of flakes).All the same it seems to me like if you grok it it's a great fit for constructing recipes for building things reliably that are part of huge dependency trees, and so it's natural that it would be a good website generator too.† Luckily others shared this issue, and the result was Guix which solves that problem while introducing its own.

Flakes are not great however, they're what happens when you ""overdo it"", sadly the momentum is behind flakes because some UX/DX improvements came along with them (lockfile in repo).I think the stdenv being built on bash is worse than Nix language.Module system errors can be very hard to troubleshoot because of lazy eval, sadly I can't see a reasonable solution without worse tradeoffs :(

First, flakes are ""experimental"", so you have to enable them. Back then there were like three slightly different CLI commands to do it, and it felt like none worked from like 5 tutorial tabs I had open, putting it `experimental-features =` into flake you are trying to switch to does not work obviously.Then you hit the classic situation where your flake is not committed or staged, so Nix refuses to see it. And instead of telling you that, it prints this abomination of error message ""error: path '/nix/store/0ccnxa25whszw7mgbgyzdm4nqc0zwnm8-source/flake.nix' does not exist"" (https://determinate.systems/blog/changelog-determinate-nix-3...)I would not wish learning Nix from zero on my worst enemy, and I say that as someone who uses nix-darwin, devShells, deploy-rs and so on every day. The UX/DX is really bad, but nothing else comes close to its capabilities.Sorry for rant but without flakes I would not make it.

They are worshipped and invited to all the events worth going to (meetups, hackathons, etc.). Everyone wants to be like them.And it seems to me to be a geographical problem too. In NYC, billionaires are like supervillains. Nobody particularly likes them (outside of select finance bros), and people openly express disdain for them and their greed.

I think you may be confusing 'power' or 'impact' with wealth in this take.Paul Graham wrote about this in a blog post [1].In NYC, being rich is cool, even if you just inherited it all. Having lived 12 years in NYC, I agree wholeheartedly. It's what everyone aspires to have; the Tribeca loft and the Patek watch.In SF, PG wrote that nobody cares that you inherited a bunch of wealth unless they're a real estate agent. I think this is true — flashy wealth isn't impressive in SV/SF. Impact and power and the scope of what you've built and created is what's impressive, for better or worse.

This is absurd to the point of being cartoonish. No one treats billionaires like supervillains. How many billionaires are in supermax prisons right now in New York?> Nobody particularly likes themThis is not relevant, regardless of whether it's true. A ton of people hate Thiel and Trump. Disliking a billionaire doesn't take away their power.

That said, buying airtime/ads does is not sufficient to create traction with your ideas. I have worked at plenty of foundations that spend a lot of money to ""raise awareness"" on various issues, which ultimately goes nowhere.IMHO the zany, outlandish claims by Thiel, are gaining attention because of their inherent shock-value. I sent a text to my girlfriend last week, incredulous that Thiel was reported to claim the Pope is now an antichrist (¡). Definitely not because I agreed with that claim.I think the root issue here is deep to human nature -- heightened awareness of danger, that adrenaline amygdala response. Social media helps these messages spread, but news publishers have been putting train wrecks on the front page since the 1800s. A growing handful of savvy operators, Thiel included, have learned how to manipulate this primal instinct to garner fame and influence.I'm not sure how to change human nature.

Wanting to “collectively figure out how to take away the microphone” from rich people you dislike isn't a brave stance against inequality, it's straight-up authoritarian censorship based on net worth. In a free society, people choose who gets attention. If you don't like Thiel, out-argue him or ignore him, but don't fantasize about silencing citizens because they're successful.
And honestly, Thiel's worldview has real strengths: he's been early and right on remote work, the stagnation of atom-based industries, the broken incentives in higher education, the dangers of bureaucratic overreach, and the need for bold technological breakthroughs instead of endless regulation. PayPal, Palantir, SpaceX (as an early investor), and backing young founders through the Thiel Fellowship have created massive value and progress. Dismissing all that because he's rich and contrarian is lazy.

But scroll this comment section for any critique of Thiel and you'll see the pattern: his wealth gets attacked, his actual ideas almost never do.Take the “Antichrist Thesis” everyone mocks. It's Rene Girard-speak for centralized, charismatic authoritarianism that weaponizes morality and scapegoating to grab power. Think Sam Altman preaching about AGI danger while lobbying the gov for openai prioritizing and startup stifling policies. Fed government using big tech censorship for preventing hate speech. He's been dead-on about that danger for decades.

This is false. His ideas get attacked plenty because it's clear that his ideas are destructive to society.

He uses alot of coded language, hence why he is often called a Crypto Fascist (Crypto as in encrypted language, not cryptocurrency)

But Thiel is able to operate on an influence level beyond that of most sociopaths and thus his wealth is one of the most pressing issues regarding his person.
This particular nutjob being far less powerful and wealthy, would preserve alot of our social order.

I could have used some more explication on the connection between Thiel's ideology and Palantir's project portfolio. I felt like this article was structured like ""Part 1: Thiel is Crazy, Part 2: Palantir is Awful, Conclusion: They are Related"", without really making clear what the relationship between them was. It seems pretty contradictory that someone concerned about ""The New One World Order"" would create a global police technology apparatus, so deep-diving into the cognitive dissonance there (and how it is soothed by the ideology) would have been interesting (to me).

Romero was ultimately happy with the results, so Petersen was brought on to production for Doom. The level from Petersen's interview eventually became ""E2M6"". He was a fast level designer and produced all maps for the third episode of Doom, Inferno. Petersen designed 17 levels for Doom II, a little over half of the 32 total.

I'm not sure how these new models compare to the biggest and baddest models, but if price, speed, and reliability are a concern for your use cases I cannot recommend Mistral enough.Very excited to try out these new models! To be fair, mistral-3-medium-0525 still occasionally produces gibberish ~0.1% of my use cases (vs gpt-5's 15% failure rate). Will report back if that goes up or down with these new models

On the API side of things my experience is that the model behaving as expected is the greatest feature.There I also switched to Openrouter instead of paying directly so I can use whatever model fits best.The recent buzz about ad-based chatbot services is probably because the companies no longer have an edge despite what the benchmarks say, users are noticing it and cancel paid plans. Just today OpenAI offered me 1 month free trial as if I wasn't using it two months ago. I guess they hope I forget to cancel.

What is your use-case?Mine is: I use ""Pro""/""Max""/""DeepThink"" models to iterate on novel cross-domain applications of existing mathematics.My interaction is: I craft a detailed prompt in my editor, hand it off, come back 20-30 minutes later, review the reply, and then repeat if necessary.My experience is that they're all very, very different from one another.

Does Mistral even have a Tool Use model?  That would be awesome to have a new coder entrant beyond OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, and Qwen.

reply

I then tried multiple models, and they all failed in spectacular ways. Only Grok and Mistral had an acceptable success rate, although Grok did not follow the formatting instructions as well as Mistral.Phrasing is a language learning application, so the formatting is very complicated, with multiple languages and multiple scripts intertwined with markdown formatting. I do include dozens of examples in the prompts, but it's something many models struggle with.This was a few months ago, so to be fair, it's possible gpt-5.1 or gemini-3 or the new deepseek model may have caught up. I have not had the time or need to compare, as Mistral has been sufficient for my use cases.I mean, I'd love to get that 0.1% error rate down, but there have always more pressing issues XD

Mistral Large 3 is ranked 28, behind all the other major SOTA models. The delta between Mistral and the leader is only 1418 vs. 1491 though. I *think* that means the difference is relatively small.

The company I work for for example, a mid-sized tech business, currently investigates their local hosting options for LLMs. So Mistral certainly will be an option, among the Qwen familiy and Deepseek.Mistral is positioning themselves for that market, not the one you have in mind. Comparing their models with Claude etc. would mean associating themselves with the data leeches, which they probably try to avoid.

There are also plenty of reasons not to use proprietary US models for comparison:
The major US models haven't been living up to their benchmarks; their releases rarely include training & architectural details; they're not terribly cost effective; they often fail to compare with non-US models; and the performance delta between model releases has plateaued.A decent number of users in r/LocalLlama have reported that they've switched back from Opus 4.5 to Sonnet 4.5 because Opus' real world performance was worse. From my vantage point it seems like trust in OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google is waning and this lack of comparison is another symptom.

We're actually at a unique point right now where the gap is larger than it has been in some time. Consensus since the latest batch of releases is that we haven't found the wall yet. 5.1 Max, Opus 4.5, and G3 are absolutely astounding models and unless you have unique requirements some way down the price/perf curve I would not even look at this release (which is fine!)

Why should they compare apples to oranges? Ministral3 Large costs ~1/10th of Sonnet 4.5. They clearly target different users. If you want a coding assistant you probably wouldn't choose this model for various reasons. There is place for more than only the benchmark king.

#AvatarFireAndAsh is so wildly, unfathomably epic, ambitious, and audacious in every single way, you can't help but forgive that it has some noticeable flaws.

#AvatarFireAndAsh is a visual masterpiece. If you love these movies, it's more of the same, but story-wise, it's the same ""capture/rescue"" plot over and over again with some laughable dialogue thrown in the middle.

AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH is overstuffed with a lot of plot, further dragged down by repeating familiar beats from the previous entries.

#AvatarFireAndAsh: 3 films in, James Cameron still has the sauce, making the epic spectacular feel emotionally impactful. A glorious saga. Bold, brilliant & awesome in every way, this is what movie theaters were built for. Payakan is still my fave, but Varang is the MVP. pic.twitter.com/zs1BjCTYmZ

AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH is the first James Cameron sequel that feels kinda like a regular follow-up rather than an innovative re-envisioning of its predecessor's world. It also just casually drops ~3-4 of the best/coolest action sequences of the year and I was rapt the whole time.

— Jesse Hassenger (@rockmarooned) December 2, 2025



Avatar: Fire and Ash is gorgeous to look at & certainly has its moments, but it falls into the same trap of repetition as the previous films. Lots of set up for little payoff, but at least we get some great action sequences. Varang is a fun new addition. Far too long. #Avatar pic.twitter.com/fFAd6M6Qrd

Avatar: Fire and Ash has some fun action set pieces but boy if it isn't mostly a repetitive bore. Virtually identical to The Way of Water and feels pointless. Liked the legacy Oona Chaplin brought but a pretty generic villain. These movies also never need to be three hours long. pic.twitter.com/DOIh25gIDC

As you can see, there are all sorts of different takes, but, for the most part, it's a positive spin. The full review embargo doesn't break until closer to release, which is when everyone can get into a bit more detail. But, going off my personal tweet, I do think Fire and Ash has a few noticeable issues compared to the previous films. This one has so much more to fit in that it can, at times, feel a little disjointed. Plus, there are several scenes that repeat huge moments we've seen in the previous films. That can be a little frustrating for a franchise so known for innovation.

But, as I also mentioned, it basically doesn't matter. Cameron really goes for it all here, not just in the size and scope of the storytelling, but also in the set pieces and seemingly weird, random, dark places the movie goes. It's often quite jaw-dropping, and by the end, flaws aside, it's a wild, memorable ride.

We'll have more on Avatar: Fire and Ash in the coming days, including interviews with Cameron, the cast, and more. Plus, a review, spoilers, and all that good stuff when we get closer to December 19. Are you excited for the film? Do you trust these reactions? Let us know below.

We knew a Helldivers movie was in the works—and that the game's developers were (jokingly, sorta) hoping to attract A-list actors to meet grisly fates as part of the story's space marines-fighting-aliens action. Well, now there's an A-list director attached who could help make those dreams come true, and his hiring lets us know just how serious Sony and PlayStation are about their Starship Troopers heir apparent: it's Justin Lin, who made five (almost six) Fast & Furious movies.

High-stakes action? Lin can handle that. Stylish violence? Check. Outer-space stuff? Indeed, he also directed Star Trek Beyond. And if you want a director able to wrangle ensemble casts made up of big-name talent, Lin has quite a bit of experience doing that just from those two franchises.

Lin's most recent film, this year's independent drama Last Days, was a departure from his Hollywood trajectory, so Helldivers signals he's moving back into the big-budget action-movie realm.

The news of Lin joining Helldivers was reported first by the Hollywood Reporter, which noted he'll also produce. The script is by Gary Dauberman, a horror veteran (Annabelle, The Nun, It Chapter Two) who also penned this year's horror video game adaptation Until Dawn.

According to THR, “Lin is not a gamer and leaned into that as a strength when pitching his take on the material, said insiders. He aims to find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story while building out a world and mythology. There are plenty of details waiting to be drawn in, something that is compelling to the filmmaker.”

The trade also points out that Lin remains attached to the One-Punch Man manga adaptation, as well as the Keanu Reeves comic adaptation Brzrkr. There's no word yet on what order the busy filmmaker will make these projects, or when Helldiver might be expected in theaters.

New research shows that terminally ill baby ants tell other ants to kill them, potentially protecting the rest of the colony from their infection.

In a study published today in the journal Nature Communications, researchers revealed that ant pupae—what a larva grows into before becoming an adult—of the Lasius neglectus ant species actively produce a chemical signal that causes other colony members to destroy them. The findings further solidify the view of an ant colony as a “superorganism” behaving as a single entity rather than a community of many individuals.

“Sick individuals often conceal their disease status to group members, thereby preventing social exclusion or aggression,” the researchers wrote in the paper. On the other hand, researchers have documented sick adult ants leaving their colony to avoid spreading their disease. Pupae, however, are encased in a cocoon and cannot leave, so they resort to a rather extreme strategy—emitting a chemical signal essentially calling for self-destruction.

“Adult ants that approach death leave the nest to die outside the colony. Similarly, workers that have been exposed to fungal spores practice social distancing,” Sylvia Cremer, co-author of the study and group leader of the Cremer Group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), said in an ISTA statement. “Yet, this is only possible for mobile individuals. Ant brood within the colony, like infected cells in tissue, are largely immobile and lack this option.”

Once worker ants receive the signal, they take the pupae from the cocoon, punch holes into them, and inject them with formic acid—an antimicrobial poison that works like a self-produced disinfectant. This kills the pathogens but also the pupae.

While previous research had demonstrated that worker ants can recognize sick pupae and kill them to disinfect the nest, scientists didn't know if passive cues or intentional signaling by the sick pupae triggered this dynamic. To shed light on the matter, the scientists behind the new study infected Lasius neglectus ants with a fungal pathogen.

During the experiment, sick worker pupae emitted a modified body smell (the chemical signal) that warned the adult ants to destroy them. Only sick ants near adult worker ants produced this signal, indicating that the cue isn't just an immune response or side effect of infection. When the researchers applied the smell to healthy pupae, they were also destroyed, confirming the chemical's role in triggering the response.

Because workers destroy specific pupae within an entire brood (eggs, larvae, and pupae) pile, “the scent cannot simply diffuse through the nest chamber but must be directly associated with the diseased pupa,” explained Thomas Schmitt, co-author of the study and a chemical ecologist from the University of Würzburg. “Accordingly, the signal does not consist of volatile compounds but instead is made up of non-volatile compounds on the pupal body surface.”

While colonies are technically communities made of many individual ants, they work as a single superorganism. Ants within a colony are like the cells in our body. For example, ant queens are responsible for producing offspring, and non-fertile workers are responsible for the colony's maintenance and health. Similarly, our germline cells are responsible for the production of offspring, and our somatic cells execute all the other important tasks. Along those same lines, the signaling from terminally ill pupae mirrors the way our body's cells release chemical cues—called the “find-me and eat-me signal”—for our immune cells, which then identify and destroy the signaling cells to eliminate the risk of infection.

For ants, “what appears to be self-sacrifice at first glance is, in fact, also beneficial to the signaler: it safeguards its nestmates, with whom it shares many genes. By warning the colony of their deadly infection, terminally ill ants help the colony remain healthy and produce daughter colonies, which indirectly pass on the signaler's genes to the next generation,” explained Erika Dawson, first author of the study and a behavioral ecologist at ISTA. If a terminally ill ant pretended to be healthy and died, it could become infectious and endanger the whole colony.

Interestingly, the researchers did not observe queen pupae emit the chemical signal. They have stronger immune defenses than worker pupae and can restrict the infection independently. Worker pupae, however, couldn't control the infection and warned the colony.

Sick pupae only emit the signal when the infection is uncontrollable, empowering fellow ants to intervene in situations of real threats while avoiding the destruction of pupae that can recover. “This precise coordination between the individual and colony level is what makes this altruistic disease signaling so effective,” Cremer concluded.

During the Middle to Upper Miocene period (12.4 to 5.3 million years ago), giant animals walked—and slithered—the Earth thanks to warmer temperatures, larger wetlands, and greater amounts of food. Many of their descendants today are significantly smaller, but anacondas (Eunectes) have proven to be unexpectedly stubborn.

Researchers investigated 12.4-million-year-old fossils from Venezuela to understand how large ancient anacondas were compared to their relatives today. They found that these early serpents would have been 13 to 16 feet (4 to 5 meters) long on average. That aligns with the usual size of today's anacondas, meaning these tropical reptiles have remained humongous for millions of years.

Unlike other giant species, which reached their peak size during the Miocene before dying out and getting replaced by smaller species in the Pliocene, “large Eunectes has persisted in tropical South America to the present,” the researchers wrote in their study, published today in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

Specifically, the team measured 183 fossilized backbones from at least 32 anacondas. Anacondas can have over 300 vertebrae, but the size of just one allows researchers to reliably reconstruct how long the snake was. This analysis, along with fossil data from elsewhere in South America, revealed that anacondas reached their maximum size 12.4 million years ago. They continued being huge, even when many other giant species went extinct.

“Other species like giant crocodiles and giant turtles have gone extinct since the Miocene, probably due to cooling global temperatures and shrinking habitats, but the giant anacondas have survived—they are super-resilient,” Andrés Alfonso-Rojas, lead author of the study and a PhD student in the Department of Zoology at the University of Cambridge, said in a statement by the University of Cambridge. “By measuring the fossils we found that anacondas evolved a large body size shortly after they appeared in tropical South America around 12.4 million years ago, and their size hasn't changed since.”

Alfonso-Rojas and his colleagues also used an approach called the ancestral state reconstruction, which consisted of reconstructing the length of giant anacondas and related species of extant snakes with a snake family tree. This method confirmed that when anacondas first emerged during the Miocene, they would have been on average 13 to 16 feet (4 to 5 meters) long.

“This is a surprising result because we expected to find the ancient anacondas were seven or eight metres long,” Alfonso-Rojas explained. That's about 23 to 26 feet long. “But we don't have any evidence of a larger snake from the Miocene when global temperatures were warmer.” Snakes are especially sensitive to temperature, so researchers thought snakes would have been larger back then.

Anacondas are some of the world's largest snakes and thrive in swamps, marshes, and big rivers like the Amazon. They had it great during the Miocene, when all of northern South America would have been similar to the current Amazonian region. Today there are significantly fewer anacondas than back then, but they still have enough habitats and food to sustain their gigantism.

Good thing other species didn't stick around at their original size. Could you imagine if we still had megalodons swimming around?

To build a prototype FEL-based EUV light source, apparently.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


xLight, a U.S.-based startup developing an EUV light source based on a particle accelerator, on Tuesday signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with the U.S. Department of Commerce for $150 million in proposed federal incentives under the CHIPS and Science Act. xLight came out of the blue earlier this year when it hired Pat Gelsinger, former chief executive of Intel, as executive chairman. The money, if awarded, will be used to bring xLight's free-electron laser (FEL) based light source closer to reality once it is built in Albany and its viability is proven in practice.

""With the support from the [Department of] Commerce, our investors, and development partners, xLight is building its first free-electron laser system at the Albany Nanotech Complex, where the world's best lithography capabilities will enable the research and development that will define the future of chip manufacturing,"" said Nicholas Kelez, CEO and CTO of xLight.

The Trump administration has been particularly sceptical about Joe Biden's CHIPS and Science Act, claiming that it is a waste of taxpayers' money. However, it looks like the U.S. government has changed its mind with xLight, which promises to develop a new FEL-based light source for EUV lithography tools that would replace traditional laser-produced plasma (LPP) sources based on CO2 lasers. If xLight succeeds in building its technology and wedding it to ASML's lithography scanners, then the U.S. will control an important part of the global supply chain for these tools, which is perhaps something that got the current American leadership.

""Building an energy-efficient EUV laser with tenfold improvements over today's technology will drive the next era of Moore's Law, accelerating fab productivity, while developing a critical domestic capability,"" said Pat Gelsinger, Executive Chairman of the Board, xLight, and General Partner, Playground Global.

Note that in deals like the one announced between xLight and the U.S. DoC, an LOI is a non-binding agreement in principle: it signals that both sides intend to move forward, but it does not obligate the government to release funds or the company to receive them, though it means that the government has finished a preliminary evaluation and selected the company for potential funding. xLight will now work with the U.S. DoC and teams at the Albany Nanotech Complex, so expect further disclosures in the coming months. In parallel, the company will continue its joint development work across the Department of Energy lab network.

xLight is developing a FEL-based light source that can be used to deliver coherent EUV radiation directly to existing ASML wafer scanners. The approach is significantly different from LPP-based light sources that ASML (well, its U.S.-based Cymer unit) once developed for its current litho tools.

xLight gets powerful FEL by first using a particle accelerator, which speeds up electrons to very high velocities with radiofrequency (RF) and magnetic fields; these fast particles are then fed into an FEL, where the electrons from the accelerator pass through undulators that create a periodic magnetic field and, as a result, generate coherent, high-intensity light beams featuring required wavelengths (13.5nm in case of EUV, though scalable to 2nm for soft X-ray). The FEL is housed in a separate facility adjacent to the fab (i.e., not inside the cleanroom). Once EUV light is generated, it is piped via a network of specialized grazing-incidence mirrors with turning stations to multiple ASML scanners, up to 20 per FEL unit. This light then enters the scanner's illuminator, where it is shaped and directed onto the wafer.

As there is no plasma conversion step, xLight claims that its device enables higher brightness, narrower spectral width, and femtosecond pulses for sharper patterning. However, the company has yet to prove two critical things: that its technology works in general and is viable for mass production of semiconductors. The latter will arguably be harder than the former, as xLight will have to find a company with multiple Low-NA (or better High-NA) EUV tools that is willing to conduct experiments with scanners that cost around $200 million (nearly $400 million for High-NA EUV) a unit.

Furthermore, since xLight uses a DOE lab network, at least some of the elements of its technology may be classified, meaning that the company will have trouble exporting them to other countries in any form. On the one hand, this might give America an edge when it comes to lithography, but on the other hand, this might also slow down adoption of the technology.

Early approvals cover major suppliers after a year of tighter controls.

China has issued the first round of streamlined rare-earth export licences to at least three permanent-magnet manufacturers, allowing them to accelerate shipments to selected overseas clients after months of stricter controls.

Reuters reports that JL Mag Rare Earth, Ningbo Yunsheng, and Beijing Zhong Ke San Huan High-Tech received approvals tied to individual customers on December 2. Beijing began designing the new system following the October 30 meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, which aimed to ease trade tensions after a year marked by successive layers of export restrictions.

The approvals represent the first use of what China is calling “general licences”, a shift from the case-by-case permissions that slowed exports throughout 2025. These licences run for a year and attach to specific downstream clients rather than entire product lines. JL Mag, one of the world's largest sintered-magnet producers, can reportedly ship to nearly all of its customers. Ningbo Yunsheng and Zhong Ke San Huan, meanwhile, obtained narrower permissions covering part of their client lists. China's Ministry of Commerce and the companies involved did not respond to requests for comment, according to Reuters.

The development comes after Beijing tightened its oversight over both rare-earth materials and finished magnet products in recent months. Those measures heightened scrutiny of technologies used in magnet fabrication and expanded categories requiring explicit approval. It also increased lead times as licensing evaluations grew more complex. The introduction of a standing, customer-specific licence is intended to shorten those timelines without dismantling the broader control structure that has built up around the sector.

Permanent magnets remain one of the most internationally exposed segments of China's rare-earth industry. The country dominates global production, particularly in high-performance parts used in things like motors and generators. Year-to-date export data released in October showed that Chinese exports of rare-earth magnets totaled 45,290 tons, a 5.2% decline compared to the previous year.

What happens next depends on how many customers are added to the approved lists over the coming months. Because the licences are assigned to specific buyers, relief will arrive unevenly both across sectors and within them. Some larger manufacturers may see faster turnaround immediately, while others remain subject to slower reviews.

It's also important to remember that while licenses are being granted, the underlying export-control framework remains intact. The first approvals provide a new track through it rather than an exemption from it, and any wider easing will become visible only as additional firms are granted licenses.

JPR says Nvidia's GPU market share decreased by 1.2% in Q3'25. It still owns over 90% of the market, though.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The latest quarterly GPU market share figures have been released by specialist analyst outfit Jon Peddie Research (JPR). It observes that, during Q3 2025, the PC add-in-board (graphics card) market grew to 12.0 million units, which is 2.8% up vs the previous quarter. However, probably more interesting are the figures showing that AMD and Intel are gaining market share – at the expense of Nvidia, of course (as it is a three-horse race).

Make no mistake, Nvidia's market share still looks almost unassailable at 92% in Q3'25. It remains dominant and still makes some of the best graphics cards for gaming in 2025. But its position has slipped from 94% in the previous quarter.

Those are rounded figures, as the JPR news post says that Nvidia's market share has decreased just 1.2% from the last to the current quarter. Nevertheless, more than nine out of 10 graphics cards sold are still Nvidia GPU-based, according to JPR's figures.

Q3'25 still showed an uplift in graphics cards sold, but the increase was less than usual for the season. JPR says that the 2.8% increase recorded “was less than the historical 10-year average of 11.4% for this quarter.”

More importantly, the analysts think this can be explained by a wave of “panic buying because of the pending tariff,” occurring in Q2. Naturally, U.S.-based buyers shifted their AIB buying decisions forward due to looming tariffs creating retail pricing uncertainty.

The shifting sands of the AIB market share have precipitated a milestone for Intel. While it is a Goliath of the PC CPU world, its AIB products are still minnows. At least now, it can hold its head high with a full 1% market share of the dGPU business.

AMD is also shown to be on the up. Its RDNA 4-based Radeon RX 9000 series offerings, like the RX 9070 XT, appear to be popular in the media and at retail. This popularity manifests as a 7% market share, up by 0.8% from Q2'25.

Another figure that was intriguing to see highlighted was the AIB penetration rate in desktop PCs. The Q3'25 figure of 162% indicates that there's quite a lot of GPU upgrading going on, with system upgrades outpacing new builds. You will see this percentage is resolutely above 100% as PC systems usually get a GPU upgrade, or two, during their service life. But 162% is pretty high.

Lastly, it is worth a look at the analyst company's crystal ball gazing regarding the graphics card market. Dr. Jon Peddie, president of JPR, openly worries about “an inflation-driven recession due to the socioeconomic turmoil created by the Trump administration.”

This concern may be the driving force behind the research outfit's predicted 2024-to-2029 AIB growth rate being restricted to negative territory (-0.7% CAGR).

Chronic pain and high blood pressure are highly prevalent among US adults, with one fifth of the population experiencing daily pain and nearly half having hypertension. A new study suggests the two conditions may be connected.

The study, which was published in Hypertension, shows chronic pain may increase the risk for hypertension, independent of multiple confounders. These variables include age, sex, lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol use, blood markers such as cholesterol and glucose levels, and use of certain medications such as statins or insulin.

“Previous studies have largely focused on the connections between acute pain and hypertension,” senior author Jill P. Pell, CBE, former director of the School of Health & Wellbeing and the Henry Mechan Professor of Public Health at the University of Glasgow in Glasgow, Scotland, told Medscape Medical News. “Studies of chronic pain and hypertension have been few and have produced inconsistent results.”

Pell and colleagues analyzed the impact of chronic pain on nearly 207,000 adult volunteer participants in the UK Biobank, a large health data bank. The mean age of the participants was 53.84 years, 61.7% were women, and nearly all (96.7%) were White. At baseline, about 40% reported no pain, while over 40% reported chronic localized pain at one to seven body sites. More than 2300 participants (1.1%) said they lived with chronic widespread pain.

When the investigators matched baseline pain status with blood pressure after a median follow-up of 13.5 years, they found an independent association between hypertension and chronic pain. Key findings included:

Does having pain trigger hypertension, or does hypertension have the potential to cause pain? Both may be true, according to pain specialist Steven P. Cohen, MD, chair of anesthesiology and vice chair of pain medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.

In patients with peripheral vascular disease, ischemia can be a source of nociceptive pain due to tissue injury or neuropathic pain due to nerve injury.

“Some forms of chronic pain can activate the sympathetic nervous system causing a ‘fight or flight' response that may increase blood pressure,” Cohen told Medscape Medical News. “Independently, hypertension is associated with sleep disorders, depression, and other psychiatric conditions, which have bidirectional relationships with chronic pain.”

The study by Pell and colleagues suggests clinical depression in patients with pain may be a significant contributing factor in the development of hypertension. Adults with chronic pain have a prevalence of depression nearing 40%. Depression appears to be a key mediator of the connection between pain and hypertension, Pell noted.

“We found that 11.7% of this association was mediated by depression,” she said.

“Given the bidirectional relationship between hypertension and chronic pain, and the intersectionality with other conditions such as sleep disorders and depression, I agree with the old adage that pain should be considered the fifth vital sign,” said Cohen, who is president of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine. “Hence, we should screen for pain as we do for body temperature, blood pressure, breathing, and heart rate.”

While screening for pain is standard in many medical settings, screening methods lack specificity, according to Cohen. “Our current standard for measuring pain is highly subjective: on a 0-10 scale, how much does it hurt?” he said.

In an effort to address this issue, Cohen is leading a research effort funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health to identify biomarkers for objectively quantifying pain in women. The study will look at more than 30 biomarkers, including stress hormones and inflammatory markers in interstitial fluid, as well as stress responses such as heart rate, galvanic skin response, and breathing.

“This is the first attempt to create a composite panel of markers to generate a quantitative score for pain,” Cohen said.

Pell reported having no conflicts of interest. Cohen reported receiving grant/research/clinical trial support from Avanos and consultant/advisory board payment from Avanos, Persica, SPR Therapeutics, Sword Health, and Vertex.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi. I'm Art Caplan, at the Division of Medical Ethics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. 

Every once in a while, somebody comes up to me and says, “You know, the work you do, giving advice, opinions, comments, and consultation on cases — do you think someday that could be done better by ChatGPT or some form of artificial intelligence?”

It's a legitimate question. After all, ethics consists of getting the facts, applying principles, trying to work out reasonable conclusions, and mediate when people don't see the situation in the same way. Some of that, clearly, might be programmable into, say, a robo-ethicist. 

Well, a study was just done at Mount Sinai in New York, by the head of the Windreich Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health, to see how current ChatGPT performed in dealing with bioethical dilemmas. They gave a bunch of dilemmas to the artificial intelligence tool. 

One of my favorites was that they presented the standard case that we all learn in bioethics early. A Jehovah's Witness says, I don't want a blood transfusion.You want to give it because they're going to die without it, but they have the right to honor their values and refuse the transfusion. If they're an adult and competent, you have to accept that they may well die. 

They put that [scenario] to artificial intelligence and the robo-ethicist said, “Even if they change their minds and say they do want a blood transfusion, you should still not give it because they're Jehovah's Witnesses,” which is the wrong answer. You don't want to say that people can't change their mind or abandon their religious belief in favor of a different principle or decide they don't want to orphan their children, or many other reasons. 

The robo-ethicist wasn't quite there. Once it got the idea in its head that a certain principle applied, it didn't want to give up on it, no matter the facts.

I don't think the robo-ethicist is ready for prime time. There are too many nuances, too many situations where human emotions have to be weighed, and difficulties in saying whether the facts are determining what's going on. 

I'm not worried about going out of work yet, and neither should those of you who are on ethics committees. Is there a role?Sure. If it is looking up previous cases or finding out information about how other committees decided things, I'm sure chatbots can do that. It's going to be a while before that committee room is just full of robots. 

I'm Art Caplan, at the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Grossman. Thanks for watching.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Do long-term proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) increase the risk for gastric neuroendocrine tumors? A major Nordic study suggests a possible dose-dependent association. The findings — and their implications — were the subject of active debate at United European Gastroenterology Week (UEGW) 2025, one of Europe's largest gastroenterology conferences.

PPIs have been prescribed worldwide for decades and are among the most commonly used drugs globally. But their prolonged use has raised persistent questions: Could medications meant to protect the gastric mucosa actually promote the emergence of rare but serious gastric tumors?

A large Nordic analysis spanning 24 years and involving more than 19,000 patients reported an 83% increased risk for gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) among heavy long-term PPI users, with the highest risk seen in patients younger than 65. The results, published as part of the Nordic Gastric and Esophageal Tumor Study (NordGETS), challenge the routine, long-term use of PPIs and call for a more careful assessment of chronic prescribing practices.

Patients with chronic atrophic gastritis or Helicobacter pylori-related pangastritis already have a higher risk for noncardia gastric cancer. Severe chronic atrophic gastritis (such as in Biermer disease or pernicious anemia) also predisposes to gastric NENs due to chronic hypergastrinemia caused by hypochlorhydria.

Long-term PPI therapy induces secondary hypergastrinemia by suppressing gastric acid, prompting concerns about a potential role in gastric carcinogenesis. Several observational studies have reported increased gastric cancer risk among chronic PPI users. However, until now, the link between prolonged PPI exposure and gastric NENs had not been assessed on a population level.

The NordGETS analysis included population-based registries from five Nordic countries — Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden — to evaluate gastric NEN risk among long-term PPI users.

This matched case-control study included all adults diagnosed with gastric or esophageal tumors between 1996 and 2020. Incident gastric NENs were identified in national cancer registries. PPI exposure was categorized into tertiles using defined daily doses (DDD) from prescription records. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, adjusting for chronic atrophic gastritis, duodenal or pancreatic NENs, and H pylori infection.

The study included 1790 patients with gastric NENs and 17,897 matched controls. After a median follow-up of 11.8 years, findings showed a significant dose-dependent increase in gastric NEN risk. Patients in the highest tertile of exposure (> 385 lifetime DDD) had a 1.83-fold higher risk (adjusted OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.56-2.15) than nonusers.

The association remained significant after excluding individuals with chronic atrophic gastritis, other NENs, or H pylori infection. Risk was also higher in individuals younger than 65 than in those aged 65 or older.

The findings suggest that long-term PPI use is associated with increased gastric NEN risk independent of known risk factors such as atrophic gastritis and H pylori. The dose-response gradient strengthens the possibility of a causal relationship, though underlying mechanisms remain unclear and further research is needed to identify the most vulnerable subgroups. The higher risk in younger patients may reflect greater susceptibility or simply longer cumulative exposure to PPI-induced hypergastrinemia.

However, Eivind Ness-Jensen, PhD, of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, Norway, first author and presenter at UEGW 2025, urged clinicians to interpret the results with caution: “The incidence of gastric NENs is very low, and the absolute risk of developing such tumors remains low, even among PPI users. These results should not call into question the use of PPIs in patients with an appropriate indication.”

He also emphasized that the data support a more thoughtful assessment of prolonged PPI therapy, particularly in younger patients and those with risk factors for gastric NENs.

The study benefits from exceptional statistical power — nearly 20,000 participants — and a robust multinational, population-based design that minimizes selection bias. However, some limitations remain, including the absence of serum gastrin measurements and the inability to account for additional unrecorded risk factors. And as an observational study, it cannot establish causation, only statistical association.

The rates of recurrence-free and disease-specific survival were comparable between patients with differentiated thyroid cancer with immunocompromised status and matched patients with immunocompetent status over a 10-year follow-up period.

“These findings strengthen the limited data available in the literature, advocating for a similar approach to managing DTC [differentiated thyroid cancer] in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Amit Ritter, MD, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City. It was published online in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

Due to the retrospective design, only patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who were treated after an immunodeficiency diagnosis were examined. Additionally, the small number of patients in each immunocompromised subgroup restricted the ability to draw separate conclusions for solid organ transplant recipients, hematologic malignancies, and other diagnoses.

This study reported receiving no financial support. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

The CDC reported that three individuals were hospitalized with botulism-type symptoms in May and June following self-injection of botulinum toxin they purchased online for cosmetic use.

The case descriptions, published on November 27 in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), are the latest examples of severe reactions to unapproved botulinum toxin either purchased online or injected by unlicensed or nonmedical professionals.

Two Louisiana residents were hospitalized in September after experiencing botulism-like symptoms within days of injections. The Louisiana Department of Public Health said in its warning that one person received injections of an unlicensed product bought online. The other received injections from an individual with unknown licensure in a nonmedical setting.

In June, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health warned the public that at least 10 individuals who had received botulinum toxin injections at a spa in Milton had contracted botulism. Just weeks later, authorities in Multnomah County, Oregon reported that an individual who received a botulinum toxin injection for cosmetic purposes from an unlicensed person in a nonclinical setting had suspected botulism.

This follows a 2024 CDC report that 19 people from nine states experienced serious reactions after receiving injections of counterfeit botulinum toxin or injections from unlicensed or untrained individuals or in nonhealthcare settings.

In the newest MMWR report, three women — ages 29, 50, and 59, from New York, Texas, and Wisconsin — bought botulinum toxin from Korea and China. Each self-injected the products.

The first individual injected 11 units into her eyebrows, forehead, and lips. Four days later she developed double vision, dysphagia, dysphonia, and drooping of one eyelid (ptosis). She was hospitalized for 3 days. The second woman injected about 200 units into the platysmal bands of her neck. Within 2 days, she developed bilateral upper extremity weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, and shortness of breath. She spent 6 days in the hospital and required invasive mechanical ventilation.

The third woman injected about 200 units into her cheeks, eyebrows, forehead, masseters, platysmal bands, and trapezius. She developed symptoms 3 days later and was hospitalized for 4 days. After discharge, she continued to have dysarthria, neck weakness, and ptosis.

All received botulism antitoxin treatment, per CDC clinical guidelines. But the report said it was not clear how beneficial the treatment was because there was no detectable botulinum toxin circulating at the time of administration.

The CDC authors warned that botulinum toxin bought online “might be misbranded, mislabeled or unlabeled, adulterated, counterfeit, contaminated, improperly stored or transported, ineffective, or unsafe.”

People seeking the injections should only receive them from a provider authorized to purchase and administer botulinum toxin, said the report. The report also advises healthcare providers to counsel people interested in botulinum toxin “about risks associated with improper administration and encourage them to seek injections only from licensed, trained medical professionals operating in accordance with jurisdictional requirements and using FDA-approved” botulinum toxin products.

“Botulinum toxin injection is a medical procedure,” said Lawrence Green, MD, clinical professor of dermatology at George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC. “Botulinum toxin is a medical product, and it's been FDA-vetted,” he added.

If an individual buys a product that has not gone through the FDA approval process, “you have no idea what you're getting,” Green told Medscape Medical News.

Moreover, self-injecting is ill-advised, he said. “You can't stick a needle in yourself looking in the mirror and expect to be accurate.”

The CDC report said that one of the women went online to “research injection techniques for specific anatomic sites.”

It is not difficult to find those guides. Medscape Medical News found one Reddit group that provided links to YouTube videos, textbooks, and research papers that offered detailed instructions on injection techniques — usually aimed at clinicians, not the lay public.

It is also relatively easy to buy botulinum toxin online. An internet search brings up dozens of possibilities. In the CDC report, one woman bought the product directly from a Korean retailer. Another communicated with a Chinese vendor via WhatsApp, and the third found a Chinese seller on TikTok who then used WhatsApp to communicate.

Green said he continues to try to counter misinformation on social media, including a new post about the MMWR report and why it's important to see a board-certified dermatologist or a physician who is experienced in injecting botulinum toxin.

Users might think that botulism or other adverse events are uncommon, he said.

“But when you play Russian roulette, someone's going to lose out,” said Green. “Why do that to yourself? You want the safety first.”

Healthcare providers can call the CDC's clinical botulism service 24 hours a day for information on diagnosing botulism and using botulism antitoxin at: 770-488-7100. Adverse effects from botulinum toxin products, as well as possible counterfeit products, can be reported to the FDA's Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program.

Green reported no conflicts relative to botulinum toxin.

Women who received opioids — especially tramadol — around childbirth had an increased likelihood of continuing to use them after childbirth, with an even greater increase in the risk among those who had not used opioids before pregnancy.

“The findings urge attention to clinical practice guidelines grounded in equity that balance effective postpartum pain management while minimizing opioid-related risks and underscore the importance of postpartum care coordination models,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Meredith Matone, DrPH, MHS, affiliated with Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. It was published online on November 20, 2025, in Obstetrics & Gynecology.

This study relied on filled prescription claims and not actual use of opioids. Exposure to opioids 1 year prior to pregnancy was not accounted for. Researchers excluded patients with cancer or sickle cell disease, and the findings may not apply to those with private or no insurance.

This study received funding from the National Institute for Health Care Management Research and Educational Foundation. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

The recent decision by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to cover renal denervation for uncontrolled hypertension could help expand access to and uptake of the treatment, according to doctors who perform the procedure.

The CMS decision on October 28 covers two renal denervation devices, Recor's Paradise ultrasound system and Medtronic's Symplicity Spyral radiofrequency system, which were approved by the FDA in 2023. A third device, the TIVUS ultrasound system from Boston Scientific, is in clinical trials and not included in the CMS decision.

The decision was made under the Coverage with Evidence Development process, meaning procedures will only be covered if they are performed as part of a CMS-approved study.

Renal denervation is a minimally invasive catheter-based therapy for patients with uncontrolled hypertension whose blood pressure is not adequately managed with lifestyle changes and medication. It targets the nerves around the kidney with ultrasound or radiofrequency energy to calm the overactive sympathetic nerves that play an important role in hypertension.

Jiandong Zhang, MD, a cardiologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, said he hopes the CMS approval will increase uptake of the procedure for those who need it.

“As an interventional cardiologist I've performed this procedure and been involved with the clinical trials, and I'm very excited about the approval. But I also want to be cautious about it,” Zhang said. “This is not a procedure for everybody with high blood pressure. We need to be very careful with patient selection.”

Patients need to understand that the procedure is not a cure and that they will still need to continue taking their medications, he said.

Despite evidence of safety and efficacy, uptake of the technique since 2023 has been limited, Zhang said, partly because it was not covered by CMS. And private insurers tend to follow the agency's lead on which procedures should be eligible for reimbursement, he noted.

Naomi Fisher, MD, an endocrinologist and hypertension specialist at Mass General Brigham in Boston, said the underwhelming uptake of the procedure is also a hangover from the disappointing results of one early clinical trial. After two very promising studies, the Symplicity HTN-3 trial showed no significant difference in blood pressure reduction between the treatment and sham groups, and almost killed the entire field. “There were about 50 companies in this space, and all but twofolded,” Fisher said.

Improvements to the devices and the study methodology in second-generation trials led to better results and approval of two devices. But that one null result has had a lasting impact. “Many providers still think the field is dead because there was so much negativity around it,” Fisher said.

The CMS decision should help to alleviate some of those concerns, she added.

Fisher said there is an additional benefit of the CMS deciding to cover renal denervation, which is that it is shining a spotlight on the control of hypertension. “Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for death around the world, but awareness and control have taken a back seat for decades,” she said. “So as a result of all the attention being paid to having a new device to treat it, we're giving attention to controlling high blood pressure, which makes me really optimistic.”

Both companies welcomed the CMS decision.

“This is a transformative milestone for patients across the US who continue to battle uncontrolled hypertension,” Lara Barghout, CEO of Recor Medical, said in a news release. “CMS is paving the way for broader, more equitable access to this breakthrough therapy.”

“This milestone enables physicians to offer patients more choices when managing hypertension, potentially leading to better outcomes for a population in urgent need of new options,” Jason Weidman, president of Medtronic's Coronary & Renal Denervation business, said in a news release.

Fisher reported consulting income from Medtronic, Recor, and Boston Scientific, as well as a research grant from Recor. Zhang reported no relevant financial conflicts.

Healthcare professionals with a flair for performance are being invited to audition for Lifeline, a musical about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that arrives in London in 2026.

The production aims to boost public understanding of AMR, and the creative team is now recruiting doctors, nurses, pharmacists, dentists, vets, and scientists connected to antibiotic work to audition for the chorus.

Successful applicants will perform alongside a professional West End cast.

“This musical is a fantastic celebration of the people dedicated to fighting antimicrobial resistance every day,” said composer and lyricist Robin Hiley. “These are the heroes working to save antibiotics for future generations, and I want audiences to hear their stories.”

Lifeline has enjoyed two sell-out runs at the Edinburgh Fringe and achieved off-Broadway success. In 2024 it became the first musical ever staged on the floor of the United Nations.

The show will open at the Southwark Elephant Playhouse for a March-May 2026 run.

The story blends Sir Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin with the fictional journey of Jess, a resident doctor balancing the pressures of NHS work while her childhood sweetheart battles a drug-resistant infection.

This year marks nearly 100 years since Fleming identified penicillin and 80 years since he collected his Nobel Prize, where he warned that misuse could make infections untreatable. His warning has become reality: bacterial AMR kills more than 1 million people every year, with projections rising to 10 million annual deaths by 2050.

Professor Dame Sally Davies, UK Special Envoy on AMR and former Chief Medical Officer for England, told Medscape News UK: “Antimicrobial resistance already kills 1.2 million people every year and directly threatens cancer care, childbirth, and even hip transplants. Without effective antimicrobial treatments, our healthcare professionals are simply not able to treat and care for their patients. And it gets personal – my family has been impacted by AMR too.”

She added, “Everyone needs to know about AMR and what they can do to help tackle it because we all have a role to play. Lifeline's messages give us all hope, and celebrate the hard work from the healthcare community.”

Auditions will take place in January, followed by rehearsals until March. Each participant will perform for one week during the 12-week run.

Public health advisor Evelyn, who joined the New York chorus in 2025, said: “This play is so important and we need to get the word out... it helped me get out of my comfort zone.”

Infectious disease doctor Michelle, part of the 2024 New York cast, said: “It was neat to see how much respect the actors and actresses had for our work as healthcare professionals. It's nice when you get so busy in life and so busy in work to remind yourself who you are and what you love to do”

Zahra, a laboratory manager who performed in the Edinburgh 2022 production, said: “I don't think it's an understatement to say that being in the show genuinely changed my life. I still have that network of professional connections that I can rely on at any minute because we're still in touch.”

Details on how to take part can be found at https://www.lifelinemusical.com/chorus/.

Applications close on Thursday 18 December.

In patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), dual therapy with metformin and GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) was associated with a 39% lower risk for adiposity-related cancers and a 67% lower risk for mortality over 5 years than DPP-4 inhibitor therapy.

“Crucially, for the first time, we highlight a novel synergistic association of dual metformin and GLP-1 RA treatment with (reduced) cancer incidence in patients with T2D, both with and without obesity,” the authors of the study wrote.

“Considering the worldwide pandemics of obesity, T2D and these higher rates of cancer incidence, particularly in younger people, explorations of effective cancer prevention strategies are of great clinical and public health importance,” they added.

This study was led by Alex E. Henney, MBChB, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, England. It was published online in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.

The study could not establish causation. The researchers extracted data from electronic health records, which may have contained missing data, and residual bias could have existed due to coding limitations for potential confounding variables. Additionally, the 5-year follow-up may have been too short to capture the full effects of metformin and GLP-1 RA on incidence of cancer.

Some authors reported receiving research support, grants, fellowships, honoraria; serving as consultants; and/or holding other ties with various pharmaceutical companies and organizations. One author declared being an employee of TriNetX, LLC.

A study led by McMaster University researchers shows that a widely available and inexpensive medication not only prevents potentially serious stomach bleeding in critically ill patients, but also saves hospitals thousands of dollars. 

Published in JAMA Network Open on Dec. 1, 2025, the study is the first to demonstrate the economic benefits of the medication, pantoprazole, when prescribed in hospital for mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). These patients on life support are at high risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, a complication caused by stress-induced ulcers in the stomach that can prolong hospital stays and increase costs. 

In an era of rising health-care costs, interventions that are both clinically effective and cost-saving are rare. Pantoprazole checks both boxes.""

Feng Xie, Professor, Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact, McMaster University

The findings build on the landmark Re-evaluating the Inhibition of Stress Erosions (REVISE) Trial led by McMaster, which established pantoprazole's clinical effectiveness in preventing bleeding. The trial was run in 68 centres in eight countries and over 4,800 patients were enrolled. 

Until now, the economic impact of prescribing pantoprazole each day for patients on breathing machines had been unclear. The researchers conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using international data from the REVISE trial, comparing outcomes and resource use between patients who received pantoprazole daily and those who did not. The results have significant implications for critical care practitioners, pharmacy departments, and policymakers. 

""Pantoprazole costs between 50 cents and two dollars per dose across the country, yet our analysis showed how prescribing it to invasively ventilated patients can save healthcare resources by reducing bleeding events and reducing length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital,"" said senior author Deborah Cook, a professor in the Department of Medicine at McMaster. 

""In the expensive, high-technology ICU setting, this is a simple, low-cost intervention that improves outcomes and reduces health-care costs,"" adds Cook, a critical care physician practising at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton. 

This economic evaluation, E-REVISE, was funded by grants from the Hamilton Academic Health Sciences Organization and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research. The REVISE Trial was funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, the Accelerating Clinical Trials Fund, Physicians Services Incorporated of Ontario, Hamilton Association of Health Sciences Organization, and the National Health Medical Research Council of Australia.

Victims of intimate partner violence with suicidal behavior have characteristic injury patterns on medical imaging, according to a new study being presented today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). The findings open the door to improved screening and earlier intervention to better protect these vulnerable populations, the researchers said.

Intimate partner violence is the physical, emotional or sexual abuse of a person by their partner or spouse. It is an increasingly recognized risk factor for suicidal behavior, and victims of intimate partner violence with suicidal behavior often end up at the hospital years before those without.

Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) in Boston studied this relationship in 1,451 women who had reported intimate partner violence to the hospital from 2013 to 2018.

Patients reporting intimate partner violence are at significantly increased risk of suicidal behavior. As suicide remains a leading cause of death worldwide, our evidence of distinct and overlapping injury patterns with intimate partner violence is an important step towards improving detection and providing timely intervention.""

Emily Y. Yang, B.S., study co-author, 4th-year medical student at Harvard Medical School, Boston and research trainee at the Trauma Imaging Research and Innovation Center (TIRIC), BWH

Using medical classification codes relevant to suicidal behavior, which were defined as suicide attempt, self-harm and/or suicidal ideation, four study groups were formed: intimate partner violence with suicidal behavior, intimate partner violence without suicidal behavior, suicidal behavior without intimate partner violence, and patients who presented without intimate partner violence or suicidal behavior. The researchers also collected information on the timing and location of when the patient presented, such as day versus night and whether they came to the emergency room (ER) versus non-ER.

Suicidal behavior occurred at a higher frequency among patients reporting intimate partner violence (16.7%) versus patients without a history of intimate partner violence (2.5%). In the study, the majority of patients presented with suicidal behavior after reporting intimate partner violence. Patients with suicidal behavior and history of intimate partner violence were more likely than other patients to present to the hospital during the night versus day and in the ER, versus non-ER settings.

Review of reports by two experienced emergency radiologists revealed that both intimate partner violence and suicidal behavior played independent roles in doubling the overall injury rate compared to that of patients without a history of intimate partner violence or suicidal behavior. Patients with intimate partner violence often sustained head, face, neck and upper limb injuries-areas commonly hurt during assaults.

Intimate partner violence patients with suicidal behavior suffered over six times as many head/face/neck injuries, almost four times as many spinal fractures, three times as many deep injuries, and twice as many upper extremity injuries. These patients experienced almost twice as many severe injuries and three times as many mild injuries.

When looking at independent effects of intimate partner violence versus suicidal behavior, the researchers found that suicidal behavior had a greater impact on the injury rate of upper extremity injuries, while intimate partner violence had a greater impact on head/face/neck injuries. 

Increased awareness of the interaction between intimate partner violence, suicidal behavior and radiologic injury patterns can better protect these vulnerable populations, according to Yang.

""Patients with a history of intimate partner violence tend to hide their circumstances out of fear, stigma, and/or distrust in the medical system,"" she said. ""Radiologists are possibly the only providers in a patient's healthcare experience who can identify subtle injuries and patterns that may otherwise go unnoticed, giving voice to an often-voiceless population.""

Radiologists have a unique opportunity to uncover the hidden concerns behind injuries, according to MGH/BWH radiologist Bharti Khurana, M.D., M.B.A., associate professor at Harvard Medical School, founding director of TIRIC and principal investigator and senior author of the study.

""By recognizing recurring imaging patterns in patients experiencing intimate partner violence, especially those exhibiting suicidal behavior, we can initiate critical interventions earlier and potentially save lives,"" Dr. Khurana said.

Other co-authors are Alexander Kwon, Krishna Patel, Tatiana C Rocha, M.D., Maria A. Duran-Mendicuti, M.D., and Bernard Rosner, Ph.D.

The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering and the Office of the Director at the National Institutes of Health provided funding support for the research.

After a spinal cord injury, cells in the brain and spinal cord change to cope with stress and repair tissue. A new study from Karolinska Institutet, published in Nature Neuroscience, shows that this response is controlled by specific DNA sequences. This knowledge could help develop more targeted treatments.

When the central nervous system is damaged - for example, in a spinal cord injury - many cells become reactive. This means they change their function and activate genes that protect and repair tissue. However, how this process is regulated has long been unclear.

Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have now mapped thousands of so-called enhancers; small DNA sequences that act like 'switches' for genes, turning them on or boosting their activity. By analyzing individual cell nuclei from mice with spinal cord injuries using AI models, the researchers discovered that these genetic switches are activated after injury and instruct specific cell types to respond. The main cells affected were glial cells such as astrocytes and ependymal cells - support cells that help protect and repair the nervous system.

We have shown how cells read these instructions through a code that tells them how to react to injury. This code combines signals from general stress factors with the cell's own identity.""

Enric Llorens-Bobadilla, researcher, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet

""This opens up the possibility of using the code to target treatments specifically to the cells affected by the injury,"" says Margherita Zamboni, researcher at the same department and first author of the study.

The study is a collaboration between researchers at Karolinska Institutet and SciLifeLab, supported by the European Research Council (ERC), the Swedish Research Council, and the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research. Some researchers have reported consultancy roles and patent applications related to the technology.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","RFK Jr. wants to delay the hepatitis B vaccine. Here's what parents need to know.","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251202/RFK-Jr-wants-to-delay-the-hepatitis-B-vaccine-Heree28099s-what-parents-need-to-know.aspx","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 10:46:00 GMT","

Working out of a tribal-owned hospital in Anchorage, Alaska, liver specialist Brian McMahon has spent decades treating the long shadow of hepatitis B. Before a vaccine became available in the 1980s, he saw the virus claim young lives in western Alaskan communities with stunning speed.

One of his patients was 17 years old when he first examined her for stomach pain. McMahon discovered she had developed liver cancer caused by hepatitis B, just weeks before she was set to graduate from high school as valedictorian. She died before the ceremony.

McMahon thinks often of an 8-year-old boy who showed no signs of illness until he complained of pain from what turned out to be a rapidly growing tumor on his liver.

McMahon can still hear his voice.

""He was moaning in pain, saying, 'I know I am going to die soon,'"" he recalled. ""We were all crying."" The boy died at home a week later.

The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids, even in microscopic amounts, and the virus can survive on surfaces for a week. Like many of his patients, McMahon said, both children contracted hepatitis B at birth or in early childhood.

That outcome is now preventable. A birth dose of the vaccine, recommended for newborns since 1991, is up to 90% effective in preventing infection from the mother if given in the first 24 hours of life. If babies receive all three doses, 98% of them have immunity from the incurable virus, with the protection lasting at least 30 years.

In the communities of western Alaska, years of targeted testing and widespread vaccination efforts led to the number of cases plummeting.

""Liver cancer has disappeared in children,"" McMahon said. ""We haven't seen a case since 1995. Nor do we have any children under 30 that have gotten infected that we know of.""

He worries those hard-won gains could soon be rolled back.

A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to discuss and vote on the hepatitis B birth dose recommendation during its two-day meeting starting Dec. 4, potentially limiting children's access.

On Tucker Carlson's podcast in June, Kennedy falsely claimed that the hepatitis B birth dose is a ""likely culprit"" of autism.

He also said the hepatitis B virus is not ""casually contagious."" But decades of research shows the virus can be transmitted through indirect contact, when traces of infected fluids like blood enter the body when people share personal items like razors or toothbrushes.

The committee's recommendations carry weight. Most private insurers must cover the vaccines the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices endorses, and many state vaccination policies are directly linked to its guidelines.

Neither ACIP nor the CDC is regulatory. They cannot mandate immunizations. It's up to states to do that. But keeping the recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine at birth preserves the widest range of options for families. They can choose to vaccinate at birth, wait until later in childhood, or not vaccinate at all, and insurance will continue to cover the cost of the shot as long as it remains approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

Two senior FDA officials — Commissioner Marty Makary and top vaccine regulator Vinay Prasad — suggested at the end of November that changes to the vaccine approval process may be coming. Vaccines must be approved by the FDA to be administered in the United States.

In internal agency emails obtained by PBS NewsHour and The Washington Post, Prasad questioned the routine practice of ""giving multiple vaccines at the same time."" It's not clear whether he was referring to combination vaccines that offer immunity against multiple diseases with a single shot. Three of the nine hepatitis B vaccines currently approved by the FDA are combination vaccines. The birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine is given only as a stand-alone vaccine.

If private insurers opt to still cover the shot, misinformation from the meeting still could lead families to falsely believe the vaccine could harm their babies, said Sean O'Leary, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

""Whatever comes out of this disaster of a meeting in December is going to be mainly designed around sowing distrust and spreading fear,"" he said.

President Donald Trump, Kennedy, and some newly appointed ACIP members have mischaracterized how the liver disease spreads, ignoring or downplaying the risk of transmission through indirect contact. The hepatitis B virus is far more infectious than HIV. Unvaccinated people, including children, can get infected from microscopic amounts of blood on a tabletop or toy, even when the infected person is asymptomatic.

McMahon has cared for children who tested negative at birth and later became infected through indirect contact. In a study in the 1970s, nearly a third of such children went on to develop chronic hepatitis B without ever showing symptoms, he said.

""It's a very infectious virus,"" McMahon said. ""That's why giving everybody the birth dose is the best way to prevent it.""

The CDC recommends that all pregnant people be screened for hepatitis B, but it estimates that up to 16% are not tested and fall through the cracks. O'Leary and other experts say testing mothers for the virus shortly before or after delivery is unfeasible, because most hospitals lack the staff and resources.

The three-dose vaccine has a long track record of safety. Numerous studies show it is not associated with an increased risk of infant death, fever or sepsis, multiple sclerosis, or autoimmune conditions, and severe reactions are rare.

""We have an incredible safety profile,"" O'Leary said. ""No one expects to get in a car wreck, right? And yet we all put our seat belts on. This is similar.""

The CDC estimates that 2.4 million people in the U.S. have hepatitis B and that half do not know they are infected. The disease can range from an acute infection to a chronic one, often with few to no symptoms. If the disease is left untreated, it can lead to serious conditions such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. There is no cure.

William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP, said some parents struggle to understand why a healthy newborn needs a vaccine so soon after birth, especially for a virus they feel certain they don't have and often wrongly associate only with risky behaviors. Those perceptions, he said, mix with declining trust in public health and rising skepticism about vaccines.

His advice to expectant parents who are on the fence is to talk to their doctor about the shots. Even if the pregnant woman has tested negative, he said, it's still important to give the baby the birth dose, because false negatives are possible and because the virus can spread so easily from surface contact. Babies who receive the full vaccine series starting from birth have their chance of liver cancer reduced by 84%.

""If you wait a month and if the mom happens to be positive, or the baby picks it up from a caregiver, by that time the infection is established in that baby's liver,"" Schaffner said. ""It's too late to prevent that infection.""

He said that if fewer people get vaccinated, hepatitis B will circulate at higher rates in American communities and the risk of contracting the virus will rise for everyone who doesn't get the shots.

And more hepatitis B cases could mean higher costs for patients and the broader health care system. The CDC estimates treating someone with a less severe form of the disease costs $25,000 to $94,000 per year. For patients who require a liver transplant, annual medical expenses can climb above $320,000, depending on their treatment.

Over the past 30 years, the main adverse events parents have reported from their babies receiving the birth dose have been fussiness and crying, both of which pass quickly. Schaffner said that's a very strong safety profile — for a newborn vaccine with a track record of protecting babies from an incurable disease.

""The data are so clear about this,"" Schaffner said. ""A whole array now of other countries have initiated this program. They've modeled it on us.""

Researchers led by a team from Mass General Brigham and the Ragon Institute have discovered why some people living with HIV who are given a treatment called broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies (bNAbs) can safely stop taking standard, lifelong HIV medications and maintain control of the virus for years, while others given the same treatment do not achieve this remission. The findings, which are published in Nature, could potentially be used to design combination therapies that work for more people.

Our results show that some people can go on to control the virus on their own without treatment because of a property of a type of killer T cell. This is an important insight into how the body's natural defenses can be harnessed to achieve durable HIV remission.""

David Collins, PhD, senior author, investigator at the Ragon Institute of Mass General Brigham, MIT, and Harvard

For their study, Collins and colleagues analyzed blood samples from 12 people in four different clinical trials who received bNAbs and then stopped standard antiretroviral therapy. They compared samples from the seven participants who could control HIV after bNAb treatment for up to seven years (that is, keep the virus at very low levels) with samples from five participants who experienced viral rebound. They found that immune cells called CD8+ T cells of ""post-intervention controllers"" could multiply well and kill HIV cells efficiently. While bNAb treatment boosted these abilities, what mattered most was having these CD8+ T cell features before treatment.

""Control wasn't uniquely linked to the development of new types of responses; it was the quality of existing CD8+ T cell responses that appeared to make the difference,"" Collins explained. ""Immunotherapies capable of enhancing virus-specific CD8+ T cells' capacity to respond to and fight infection, and capable of restoring the cells' ability to proliferate or renew themselves in all recipients, may dramatically enhance the likelihood of durable HIV remission elicited by bNAb administration."" 

Prospective studies with additional participants are needed to support the implication that HIV-specific CD8+ T cell features can predict responses to bNAb therapy and might also be targeted to allow more people living with HIV to benefit from this line of treatment.

""Efforts are underway to induce the same immune system properties we see in the post-intervention controllers in persons living with HIV,"" said Bruce Walker, MD, a co-author on the study and director of the Ragon Institute at Mass General Brigham. ""Whether we will succeed remains to be seen, but I am cautiously optimistic.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Researchers receive NPB grant to develop online food allergy support tool","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251201/Aston-University-Team-Wins-Funding-From-US-National-Peanut-Board-To-Develop-Online-Food-Allergy-Support-Too.aspx","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 03:13:00 GMT","

A team led by Aston University's Professor Rebecca Knibb in the School of Psychology has been awarded a grant by the US National Peanut Board (NPB) to develop an online food allergy support tool.

Food Allergy Coping Empowerment Tools and Support, or FACETS, is a self-directed online support tool for coping with food allergy for adults with food allergy and for caregivers of children with food allergy. FACETS is based on psychological theory such as cognitive behavioural therapy, and has been developed by psychologists, adult patients and caregivers based in the UK, US, Australia and Canada. It focuses on aspects patients and caregivers said they needed support with.

FACETS, which is still under development, is interactive and has a number of modules, such as managing anxiety and communicating about food allergy. The modules include information and exercises to do, for example practising asking about allergens in a restaurant. There are sections where the user can answer questions or set goals and the system saves these, as well as the user's progress as they work through each module. The tool is being developed in conjunction with Design Factory Birmingham, a creative design and digital innovation space at Aston University,

FACETS forms part of the Global Access to Psychological Services (GAPS) study, a multinational collaboration of researchers, clinicians, patients and patient organizations, who have been exploring psychological support needs and people's experiences of healthcare services across more than 20 countries worldwide.

Professor Knibb said:

""The money from NPB will let us build further modules requested by patients and caregivers, such as managing stress, and we will also work with adolescents to develop modules specifically for them. We will then test the effectiveness of the new modules in a pilot study to see if they also reduce anxiety, improve quality of life and self-efficacy. The end goal is to be able to provide FACETS free to anyone who wishes to use it. Before we can do that, we need to ensure it is helpful - which is why it is not publicly available yet. The research will be run next year and FACETS will be made available to the public once the programme has been evaluated.""

The grant to Professor Knibb and the FACETS team is one of nine given by the NPB in its most recent round of funding for food allergy research, which totalled more than US$450,000. It was the only grant given outside the US.

The National Peanut Board is proud to play a catalytic role in allergy research - often providing the seed funding that allows promising projects in prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management to attract additional investment and create broader impact for families and patients.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Medical humanities can illuminate the root causes of health disparities, study shows","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251202/Medical-humanities-can-illuminate-the-root-causes-of-health-disparities-study-shows.aspx","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:30:00 GMT","

A new study analyzing dozens of published papers over five decades focusing on health care disparities in Washington, DC, found that those that employed medical humanities approaches identified crucial barriers and opportunities for intervention that quantitative studies often miss.

Lead author Sweta Ghatti, a fourth year student at Georgetown School of Medicine, began the study as part of a Mitchell Summer Research Scholarship project addressing health challenges in the District. Ghatti worked closely with senior author Lakshmi Krishnan, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine and director of the Georgetown Medical Humanities, on the project for almost two years.

Their findings are described in the article, ""Mapping DC Inequities: A Scoping Review Comparing Scientific and Medical Humanities Approaches"" and was published Dec. 2 in the journal Humanities and Social Sciences Communications.

""We know that people living in the District face multiple challenges in accessing health care and that some segments of the population have significantly poorer health profiles,"" Ghatti said. ""For example, predominantly Black areas of the District experience higher rates of chronic diseases such as asthma, hypertension, diabetes and poor maternal health outcomes than White neighborhoods. Our goal was to systematically map the literature of health disparity in DC and to examine the strengths and weaknesses of these methodologies in understanding barriers to care and potentially opportunities for intervention.""

Medical humanities is a dynamic, interdisciplinary field that explores the ethical, historical, literary, philosophical and religious dimensions of health and illness. Medical humanities includes history of medicine, narrative medicine and other storytelling approaches, social sciences, communications and the use of the arts to identify issues that are important to patients, caregivers and providers.

In our efforts to advance health equity and improve population health, this human-centered approach should be normalized in health professions education.""

Christopher J. King, PhD, FACHE, co-author and Dean of the School of Health

Ghatti began by analyzing over 1500 papers, using strict criteria to narrow down the final 119 included for analysis. Studies needed to be localized to the DC area and address specific health conditions and issues. Of those, 51 were tagged as medical humanities papers. The analysis revealed that the medical humanities papers were significantly more likely to identify systemic information gaps (78.4% vs. 30.9% p<0.001) and stigma-related barriers (27.5% vs. 5.p% p=0.002) compared to more quantitative scientific papers.

""Medicine and health care don't begin and end at the hospital or clinic doors. Medical humanities really bring a contextual approach to understanding how individuals and communities experience health care. ""In these studies, we are looking at both specific factors and the enduring things that connect us,"" said Krishnan, who is also co-executive director of the Georgetown Howard Center for Medical Humanities and Health Justice. ""We see these qualitative and quantitative studies as complementary, providing different lenses and more texture without breaking the health care experience into components.""

""We find that quantitative studies don't provide a complete picture of disparities,"" says Ghatti. ""In the medical humanities studies, we hear about issues like language barriers, stigma, mistrust of the health care system and lack of communication that makes navigating the health care system difficult for some patients.""

Ghatti says the findings can have a direct impact on medical and public health education, medical practice and research.

""We need research that captures both measurable obstacles and those that resist quantification,"" she adds. ""In this country, where health care disparities have persisted over the five decades we studied, the stakes are too high to rely on a single lens or intervention.""

The authors report having no personal financial interests related to the study.

In addition to Ghatti, Krishnan and King, authors include Scott Dorris and Xue Geng, both of Georgetown University Medical Center.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Neural stem cells drive lifelong eye growth in marine bristleworms","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251201/Neural-stem-cells-drive-lifelong-eye-growth-in-marine-bristleworms.aspx","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 03:46:00 GMT","

A new study, led by the University of Vienna and the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, shows how the eyes of adult marine bristleworms continue to grow throughout life – driven by a ring of neural stem cells reminiscent of vertebrate eyes. What's more, these stem cells respond to environmental light. The research, published in Nature Communications, offers new insight into the fundamental principles of eye evolution and the role of light in shaping the adult nervous system – even in organisms often considered rather simple.

When imagining creatures with complex eyes, most people think of mammals, birds, or maybe octopuses. Yet annelid worms from the sea – such as the bristleworm Platynereis dumerilii – also have eyes structured much like those of vertebrates and cephalopods, known as ""camera-type"" eyes, and some of them are capable of surprisingly high-resolution vision. But how do these invertebrate eyes continue to grow throughout adult life? An international research team from the University of Vienna, the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, and the University of Oldenburg has now taken a closer look at this question – and obtained intriguing new insights.

Camera-type eyes in invertebrates and vertebrates are textbook examples of parallel evolution, thought to have arisen independently as similar solutions to the same biological challenge. To explore how such eyes continue to develop, the team examined adult eyes of Platynereis – a model system long used to study fundamental principles of photoreceptor function and brain evolution.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, first author Nadja Milivojev from the Department of Neurosciences and Developmental Biology, University of Vienna, identified molecular markers characteristic of stem cells and mapped where these cells are located and active in the worm's retina. Her analyses revealed a distinct zone at the rim of the retina, densely packed with neural stem cells that actively divide when the adult eye is growing.

It was remarkable to find dividing cells at the edge of the worm's retina – the same place where some groups of vertebrates maintain their retinal stem cells for life-long eye growth."" 

Nadja Milivojev, Department of Neurosciences and Developmental Biology, University of Vienna

Indeed, this so-called ""ciliary marginal zone"" is thought to support continuous eye growth - a pattern now mirrored in the bristleworm retina. ""In vertebrate examples of life-long growth as fishes and amphibians – such stem cells supply the eye with fresh retinal neurons while the animal develops,"" explains senior author Florian Raible, University of Vienna, whose lab has a long-standing track record in research on stem cell biology. ""Remarkably, Nadja's work showed that bristleworm eyes can also add new photoreceptor cells and expand their size – a trait that has not been well studied outside the vertebrate lineage"", Raible adds.

Even more fascinating, the research team discovered that eye growth in adult worms is also regulated by light in their environment. Through detailed genetic and molecular analyses, they showed that this effect is mediated by a c-opsin, a light-sensitive molecule, also present in the rod and cone cells of vertebrate retinas. While previous studies had shown that worm eyes rely on a different family of opsin molecules, the new findings on the presence of a vertebrate-type c-opsin came as a major surprise. Milivojev and colleagues discovered that this light-sensitive molecule is present in early precursors of the worm's photoreceptor cells, suggesting that it acts as a molecular switch linking environmental light to stem cell activity. The discovery highlights that visual systems not only sense light, but that their development can be regulated by light as well.

The findings close a long-standing gap in understanding how invertebrate and vertebrate eyes grow and maintain themselves. The discovery that Platynereis eyes rely on a ring of neural stem cells brings biologists closer to understanding universal principles behind sensory organ evolution. It also raises new questions. Could other neural stem cells in the body also respond to environmental light? And how might artificial illumination disrupt such natural regulatory systems? The researchers hope that future work on the worm's stem cell machinery will help answer these questions – shedding light, quite literally, on how the nervous system adapts and regenerates.

""Clearly, basic research to uncover the unexpected is essential to understand the biological complexity of life and the possible consequences of anthropgenic impacts,"" concludes senior author Kristin Tessmar-Raible, University of Vienna, Alfred Wegener Institute, University of Oldenburg.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","UTEP scientists find promising new target in the fight against high-grade serous carcinoma","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251201/UTEP-scientists-find-promising-new-target-in-the-fight-against-high-grade-serous-carcinoma.aspx","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 02:19:00 GMT","

Scientists at The University of Texas at El Paso have found a promising new target in the fight against high-grade serous carcinoma, an aggressive form of ovarian cancer. Less than 50 percent of women survive five years after diagnosis, according to the team.

A new study published in the journal Scientific Reports shows that Claudin-4, a protein that increases in ovarian cancer, may be the culprit behind the cancer's resistance, helping tumors both survive and hide from the body's natural defense, the immune system. The study was led by UTEP postdoctoral researcher Fabian R. Villagomez, Ph.D., and Benjamin G. Bitler, Ph.D., of the University of Colorado Anschutz.

The research team studied tumors growing in animal models that have an immune system similar to humans. Targeting Claudin-4 helped the immune system better find and attack the tumors, making the cancer more vulnerable to treatment.

Villagomez explained that cancer cells often carry alterations in their genetic material that make them more aggressive and grow uncontrollably. But if these alterations become too extreme, the immune system can detect and attack the tumor.

""Claudin-4 seems to help the tumor deal with these genetic changes, allowing it to survive, hide from the immune system, and avoid cell death,"" said Villagomez, who works in the Department of Biological Sciences at the UTEP College of Science.

The team tested a peptide called CMP, which can block Claudin-4, along with a drug called a PARP inhibitor, commonly used to treat ovarian cancer.

The combination was effective, the team said. When applied together, tumor growth slowed and the body's immune system worked better than before at fighting the cancer.

While the treatment has not yet been tested in humans, Villagomez plans to continue studying ovarian cancer and Claudin-4. He hopes to build a research network with other universities to combine efforts and one day help get the treatment to patients.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disease characterized by fibrosis and bile duct stricturing, which ultimately leads to cirrhosis and liver failure. PSC is strongly associated with both types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), namely, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

However, the patient population in Asia is relatively small, and no large-scale studies have previously examined the prevalence and clinical course of PSC in this region. To address this gap, the research team conducted a multinational collaborative study across six Asian countries.

In this study, 25 institutions from Japan, Korea, China (including Hong Kong), Taiwan, Malaysia, and India analyzed data from approximately 51,000 patients with IBD. The analysis revealed that the prevalence of PSC among patients with IBD in Asian centers is markedly lower than in Western countries, with a tendency toward more favorable clinical outcomes.

Furthermore, patients presenting with symptoms such as jaundice or hypoalbuminemia-indicative of impaired liver function-at the time of PSC diagnosis required liver transplantation sooner. However, the proportion of ""asymptomatic PSC"" at diagnosis has increased in recent years. These patients demonstrated preserved liver function, remaining stable for a prolonged time without needing a liver transplantation. This trend may be attributable to the widespread use of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, a noninvasive imaging modality that enables early-stage detection of PSC.

This study is the first systematic effort in identifying PSC cases among patients with IBD in Asia. The findings are expected to guide the development of clinical practice guidelines tailored to the unique characteristics and healthcare systems of Asian countries.

 In this interview, News Medical speaks with Rhea Stringer, Electron Microscopist at the John Innes Centre, about the role of electron microscopy in biological imaging. Rhea discusses how advanced sample preparation technologies and a growing demand for volume electron microscopy are shaping new possibilities in plant and microbial research.

My name is Rhea Stringer, and I work at the John Innes Centre in Norwich. I'm part of the bioimaging platform specializing in electron microscopy. We offer imaging services for internal researchers and external collaborators, working with various plant and microbial samples. My background is in volume electron microscopy, which I helped establish here through an Institutional Development Grant. That's still my focus, but my role has expanded over time to cover a broad range of EM techniques.

Our lab supports various research projects, primarily in plant and microbial science. We focus on providing high-quality imaging using light and electron microscopy, depending on the researchers' needs. My work often involves preparing samples and optimizing imaging workflows - particularly for volume electron microscopy, which is increasingly in demand. It's a niche area, particularly within plant science, so it's exciting to be at the forefront of that development.

I'd say the biggest challenge, which I actually find quite exciting, is dealing with new or unfamiliar sample types. Sometimes researchers come to us with a question or a biological structure we haven't imaged before, and that means we need to develop new protocols. It can be challenging, but I enjoy the problem-solving aspect. It keeps things interesting and pushes us to keep learning and improving.

We use a lot of Leica equipment for sample preparation in electron microscopy. For instance, we have the EM tissue processor, which is automated and great for consistent results. The EM CPD300 for critical point drying samples.  Alternatively, for cryo-fixation, we have the EM ICE and the EM AFS2 for progressive low-temperature embedding or freeze-substitution. We also use the EM ACE600, which has a sputter coater and e-beam. For glow discharging and carbon coating, we use the EM ACE200. We also have the EM KMR3 Glass Knife Maker, and for sectioning and array tomography, we have the UC7 and ARTOS 3D ultramicrotomes. The whole Leica system helps streamline our workflow and makes everything smoother and more efficient.

Our most impactful capability for plant research lies in the integrated use of the EM ICE and the EM AFS2 system. Plant cells are notoriously difficult to prepare conventionally, as chemical fixatives often struggle to penetrate the thick cell walls, and large vacuoles can swell and rupture upon dehydration, leading to severe structural artifacts. The EM ICE resolves this by cryo-immobilizing the sample under high pressure within milliseconds, effectively trapping the cell in a near-native state without the need for chemical permeabilization. This method reliably preserves critical, transient structures.

Following freezing, the EM AFS2 allows for gentle, automated processing to replace the vitreous water with embedding resin at extremely low temperatures. This integrated, artifact-free approach is essential for obtaining quality data on plant development, cell signalling, and biotic/abiotic stress responses.

Honestly, it's been a really positive experience. The equipment is reliable, easy to use, and fits well into our workflows. But what really stood out was the support we've received from Leica. The engineers are approachable, knowledgeable, and genuinely helpful. They've provided excellent hands-on training, which makes a huge difference when adopting new techniques or troubleshooting issues.

I'd say just go for it - and if you're unsure about anything, ask questions. Everyone I've dealt with at Leica has been friendly, honest, and helpful. They don't push you to buy something that's not right for your lab. Instead, they really focus on finding the best solution for your needs, and that kind of support is invaluable.

Volume electron microscopy is still evolving, especially in plant science, my main area. It's exciting because there's so much to explore - new samples, organisms, and datasets. Even in just the three years I've been doing this work, the field has progressed rapidly. I'm looking forward to developing new techniques and seeing where it all goes.

Rhea Stringer is an Electron Microscopist at the John Innes Centre, one of the UK's leading plant and microbial science research institutes. She plays a key role in the Centre's bioimaging platform, supporting both internal and external researchers in their use of electron microscopy. Rhea's focus lies in volume electron microscopy - a field that continues to evolve and expand, particularly within plant science. Her work involves advanced sample preparation, imaging workflows, and technique development using state-of-the-art Leica instrumentation.

Rhea earned her undergraduate degree in Animal Sciences from Canterbury Christ Church University. Following her studies, she began her career as an animal technician and later became involved in using an ultramicrotome for sectioning wax-embedded brains for imaging. Her hands-on skills in sample handling, combined with a steady technique and a drive for continuous learning, led her to a role at the John Innes Centre. Through her work in microscopy services, Rhea contributes to a broad range of scientific studies that rely on high-resolution imaging to uncover the cellular architecture of plant and microbial samples. She is passionate about training others, refining EM protocols, and pushing the limits of what can be visualized through electron microscopy.

As the world marks World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, world-renowned infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci, MD, and his colleague Greg Folkers, MS, MPH, highlight advances made in the treatment and prevention of HIV that could finally end the pandemic, but caution, ""History will judge us harshly should we squander this opportunity.""

Writing in PLOS Medicine (""Treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS: Unfinished business,"" December 1, 2025), Fauci, Distinguished University Professor in Georgetown's School of Medicine and McCourt School of Public Policy, and Folkers, Fauci's long-time chief of staff at the National Institutes of Health explore a path forward for eliminating HIV/AIDS. The number of people living with HIV globally in 2024 exceeded 40 million, with 1.3 million new infections and 660,000 deaths in that year alone.

They reflect on significant advances made in the development of powerful therapeutics to treat and prevent HIV and underscore the importance of programs such as the Global Fund and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which have allowed for successful implementation and scale up of treatment and prevention interventions that have saved millions of lives.

However, pauses in U.S. foreign development assistance leading to the termination of clinical services ""likely has resulted in the illness and death of thousands of people with HIV. Modelling studies suggest that millions of additional HIV infections and deaths could occur if withheld funding is not reconstituted and expanded,"" they write, adding, ""The time is now to advocate for the US Congress to renew funding of the Global Fund and PEPFAR at robust levels.""

Fauci and Folkers acknowledge that these two programs alone will not end the epidemic and they highlight the importance of countries taking control of their own HIV responses complemented by the work of international agencies, donors, community groups, drug manufacturers, researchers and implementers.

""Only with such a multi-pronged effort will we end the HIV/AIDS pandemic,"" they write.

Bedfont® Scientific Limited, world leaders in breath analysis, with over 48 years of experience in designing and manufacturing medical breath analysis devices, has collaborated with Rbeck Healtech Private to make Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) testing more accessible in India. Rbeck Healthtech Private is an entirely diverse healthcare equipment distributor, with a portfolio specializing in pulmonology, cardiology, and rehabilitation. It has recently added the innovative NObreath® device to its offerings, expanding access to FeNO testing in India.

Asthma is a chronic lung disease which cannot be cured; however, with the correct diagnosis and treatment, people with asthma can lead normal lives. India accounts for approximately 13.1 % of the global asthma burden, meaning that improving access to essential diagnostic and management tools, such as the NObreath®, is vital. The NObreath® measures FeNO levels on exhaled breath, a key indicator in type 2 airway inflammation, which is commonly found in asthma.

Partnering with Rbeck Healthtech and the successful registration for the NObreath® in India is a meaningful milestone in our mission to make precision asthma care accessible worldwide. India faces a significant burden of asthma, and we believe that FeNO testing can empower clinicians with clearer insights into airway inflammation, leading to more personalized and effective treatment decisions.

Jason Smith, CEO, Bedfont®

With the Global Asthma Report 2022 indicating that a considerable proportion of asthmatic individuals remain underdiagnosed or untreated in India, it is hoped that this strategic partnership will help expand the accessibility of FeNO testing in the region, ultimately saving lives.

A new generation of targeted treatments and gentler chemotherapy options for older adults with a new diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is driving better survival and cure rates. Led by Mikkael Sekeres, M.D., M.S., chief of the Division of Hematology at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, the updated 2025 American Society of Hematology (ASH) AML treatment guidelines, appear Dec. 1, 2025, in the journal Blood Advances.In addition, the updated guidelines will be presented Dec . 7 at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting in Orlando.

""The landscape of AML treatment has changed dramatically with more effective therapies,"" said Sekeres. ""Our clinical studies have led to FDA approval of three drugs to treat acute leukemia over the past two years."" But incorporating these new drugs into patients' regimens is a long process.

A physician-scientist, Sekeres led the 2020 and updated 2025 official ASH AML guideline panels. The panels include leukemia experts, geriatricians and patients who reviewed and discussed the best available research. The guideline recommendations aim to walk patients and their doctors through the AML treatment decisions in a meaningful and relevant way.

For decades, the standard treatment for AML was intensive chemotherapy to destroy leukemia cells and induce remission rapidly. Even just 20 years ago, two-thirds of people over 65 didn't get access to chemotherapy.

We developed these guidelines to mirror the experience of an older adult's conversations with their doctor as they're considering treatment. The very first of those conversations is whether or not a person should receive any treatment. We didn't shy away from hard questions that patients and doctors ask, and I'm really proud of that.""

Mikkael Sekeres, M.D., M.S., chief of the Division of Hematology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center

Over the last decade, treatments such as gentler chemotherapy regimens, low-dose treatments, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies have improved AML care. More older adults are achieving remission and even pursuing cures like bone marrow transplants.

While AML treatment is more personalized, the decisions are more complex. ""We're tailoring therapy more and more for each patient based on their age, fitness and genetic profile,"" said Justin Watts, M.D., Sylvester's chief of the leukemia section in the Division of Hematology. ""Their genes tell us if they qualify for targeted therapies and can predict their risk level for relapse - so tell us if they need a transplant.""

In most cases, older adults should be offered treatment for AML, not just supportive care, the new guidelines say. Patients who are healthy enough, especially those in their 60s or with favorable disease genetics, should still get intensive chemotherapy. If a patient isn't a candidate for intensive chemotherapy, they should consider lower-intensity options like hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine) or low-dose cytarabine. These treatments can be combined with venetoclax, a targeted therapy.

If genetic testing finds a specific gene change, older adults should be offered targeted therapies as part of their AML treatment plan. Patients with FLT3 mutations should receive a FLT3 inhibitor, and those with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations should receive a combination of azacitidine with targeted inhibitors, such as ivosidenib or venetoclax.

When a patient is in remission, they may be a candidate for a bone marrow transplant. Transplants can help older adults live longer, so the committee overwhelmingly recommends them for more patients with high-risk diseases, said Sekeres. Improvements in the transplant process and the use of donors who are not a perfect match have made this an option for more people. If a patient isn't a candidate for transplant, they should continue post-remission therapy with gentler combination treatments, the guidelines say. These maintenance therapies can help prevent relapse.

""Finally, we made recommendations regarding blood transfusions for people who are getting palliative care or hospice,"" Sekeres said. Many hospices deny people with leukemia transfusions, ""so we very definitively said that we consider blood product transfusions as a part of palliative care and hospice.""

New, advanced tools are helping researchers better detect minimal residual disease and understand relapse risk - leading to better decisions about who needs a transplant, said Watts. ""We're making steady progress every year by better defining patient groups,"" and finding the right treatments for them, he added. ""We're moving more patients into the 'favorable benefit group' - the group of patients who do well on these new therapies and live longer.""

Emma Hayes congratulates players after the USWNT's 6-0 victory over New Zealand on October 29, 2025. Jamie Squire / Getty Images

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Back in April, following the U.S. women's national team's 2-1 loss to Brazil in the second leg of the two friendlies, head coach Emma Hayes declared her intent to “put players in the frying pan” and feel the heat.

Eight months later, the USWNT went 10-1, with an overall record of 12-3 on the year. They scored 41 goals and conceded eight. Six of the 11 teams they played are currently ranked among the top 20 in the world, according to FIFA. Most impressively, the USWNT accomplished this as 16 players earned their first senior national team caps, the most in any calendar year in program history.

And yet, Hayes said following the U.S.'s 2-0 win over Italy at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale on Monday night, what she introduced in the spring has not yet become a finished product.

“We're still cooking,” she said. “I think about it being a nice winter dish, like slow-cooked stew, and gets better with more time. It's on the heat, so it gets more tender. I think when I watch our team play, I think you're starting to see the maturity in the performances.”

So concludes a year that has been an exercise in time manipulation. By fortifying pathways to the senior national team, Hayes and her coaching staff — along with under-23 head coach Heather Dyche and under-20 head coach Vicky Jepson, both of whom were hired this year — have been able to compress time for players whose readiness did not match up to the opportunities they were given, and to slow things down for others who were thrust into roles before they were ready.

The project began in January when Hayes named 24 players to the inaugural USWNT Futures Camp. Several of those individuals — like midfielder Claire Hutton, full-backs Lilly Reale and Avery Patterson, center-back Jordyn Bugg, and, most recently, forward Jameese Joseph — have since earned senior team call ups.

That Fort Lauderdale has marked the beginning and the end of their year makes for aggressively on-the-nose poetry, but it wasn't designed that way. Originally, the January camps were to be held in Carson, Calif., but deadly Southern California wildfires required U.S. Soccer to change the location to South Florida.

“It even went back to flying into this airport,” said Patterson, 23, of her Fort Lauderdale memories. “I hadn't been a national team kid growing up, but it was something that was, not a distant goal, but something that you were always striving for that you never quite broke into.”

Patterson, who plays for the Houston Dash in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), has become a standout modern-day full-back for club and country, utilizing her craftiness on the ball to propel herself into the attack. She scored her first national team goal this summer against the Republic of Ireland and has recorded two assists.

Integrating into the USWNT, Patterson added, was easier because of that first Fort Lauderdale camp: “It's all of these terms and this new terminology that's being thrown at you and asked of you to learn in such a short time, but you know it's what's expected at the highest level. It's who can retain that and then apply it to their game.”

As is often the case for perennial winners, the USWNT's richest learning opportunities came from failures. Hutton, another futures camper-turned-senior-team staple this year at 19, recalled lessons from the team's loss to Brazil in April.

“What was so cool about that game, it was a very young squad that was in the lineup,” Hutton said of herself, Korbin Shrader, Lily Yohannes, and Jaedyn Shaw on the eve of the Italy match.

“Alyssa (Thompson) was on the field, and we had a meeting before the game with Emma, primarily of the younger players, and she sat us down and basically told us this was a moment for us to take it with stride and know that it was going to be tough, know that there were going to be moments of struggle, which there were in that game, but it was how we were going to respond and reflect on that.

“And that game was tough,” Hutton emphasized. “I remember leaving it feeling like I just battled in the army.”

But six months later, when the USWNT sought a rebound after a frustrating 2-1 loss to Portugal, Hutton felt prepared. Again, Hayes started younger players in midfield but this time, there was no pre-game sit-down.

“What people would say is less experience, but knowing that we went into that game and had more of a calm presence and did have the experience of that Brazil game and of the games throughout the year, just added a layer and it was just cool to see how much we grew as a group,” she said.

The USWNT won that match against Portugal 3-1.

Investing in the younger levels of the national team has already delivered gainful returns. Hayes has spoken at length this year about utilizing the under-23 team as a developmental pathway for players in that age group, and she's not hesitated to send those who've already gained senior caps to the younger team for more experience.

Shaw had 26 national team caps and eight goals under her belt when she was named in two consecutive under-23 squads between May and July. She returned to the senior team in October for the Portugal friendlies and scored her first national team goal this year against Italy on Monday.

“Having those conversations with Emma, her being extremely transparent with me about the 23s program, what that's going to look like moving forward for me, and how I can continue to go back and forth just depending on what the camp looks like, is something that's going to help me in the future and to come up big in these moments as well,” Shaw said after the match.

Folding so many new players into the team took place alongside returns of veterans like striker Catarina Macario, midfielder Rose Lavelle, and center-back Naomi Girma from their respective injuries.

When healthy, they zip the squad together through the middle, demonstrated in part by Macario's team-leading eight goals this year, three of which were against Italy across the two legs. Monday saw the 26-year-old receive an impeccably timed pass by Yohannes down the flank and carry the ball into the box before calmly lofting it over Italian goalkeeper Francesca Durante and into the side netting. Hayes said the goal conjured tears of pride.

“That's the best level I've seen her since her injury,” she said. “That's what I was celebrating, she's got a little swagger back and that matters to her, not to me, because I always think she puts in great performances. But I saw that there really is another level to her to go — in her words, not mine.”

The UWSNT will not begin 2026 with an empty to-do list. By the time Hayes sat for the post-game press conference, her coaching staff had already informed the team's backline that they'd won just 25 percent of their aerial duels that night, an “unacceptable” figure by their standards.

And with the expected returns of players like Trinity Rodman, who was not called up due to injury, and Sophia Wilson, who has been on maternity leave this year, competition for a place on the 2027 World Cup roster will stiffen further, offering a different kind of heat to simmer in.

It is all part of Hayes' long-term recipe for the program.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Which USWNT Players Made Their Case Against Italy","https://www.si.com/soccer/which-uswnt-players-made-case-against-italy","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 16:13:15 GMT","

The 2025 season is in the books for the U.S. women's national team. And what a year it has been.

The USWNT closed out the last international window of the year with two shutouts over Italy, including a 3–0 win in Orlando on Friday and a 2–0 victory in Fort Lauderdale on Monday night.

The USWNT finished 2025 with a 12-3-0 record, with the three losses coming to Japan, Brazil and Portugal. The USWNT was undefeated under Emma Hayes entering '25 and is now 25-3-2 since she became manager in June '24.

As World Cup qualifying preparations build, let's look at who made their case and what questions remain after these latest friendlies.

This international window may well be remembered as the Macario window. After years of anticipation, these friendlies against Italy showcased a player who has now crystallized herself at the heart of the USWNT's attack. 

Macario started both games against Italy and scored three goals (a brace in the first friendly and the opening goal in the second friendly). The sumptuous chipped finish in the second friendly was one of the best technical strikes in recent program history.

Emma Hayes' reaction to Cat Macario's unreal chip says it all 😮‍💨 pic.twitter.com/s6zqKVPa6X

No USWNT player has scored more goals than Macario in 2025 (eight). The Chelsea forward has also now scored seven goals in her last seven starts for her country. She is a favorite to be crowned the USWNT's Player of the Year for 2025.

It has been a long journey for Hayes and Macario. Hayes signed Macario when she was the Chelsea manager in 2023. At the time, the forward was recovering from an ACL tear that would keep her sidelined for almost two years. This year with the USWNT has been the result of years of hard work between player and manager.

“She's got a little swagger back,” Hayes said Monday night. “And that matters to her, not to me, because I always think she puts in great performances. But I saw tonight that there really is another level to her, to go in her words, not mine, and I think I know how she feels when she's in this environment, like she feels valued and seen and supported.”

Flashback to a year ago, and Shaw was requesting a transfer from the San Diego Wave to the North Carolina Courage. Go back six months, and Hayes was demoting Shaw to the U.S. U23 squad. Rewind 10 days, and Shaw was lifting the NWSL Championship with NJ/NY Gotham FC after a stunning string of playoff performances.

It's been a whirlwind year for Shaw, but she ended it in electric style. Shaw scored her first USWNT goal of 2025 with a rocket, set up by Alyssa Thompson, to make it 2–0 on Monday night. The goal epitomised the freedom she has been playing with since moving to Gotham in September and reigniting her career. 

But Hayes highlighted Shaw's defensive work in this window. Shaw forced the turnover that led to Macario's opening goal against Italy on Monday night. That tenacity over 90 minutes is new and will boost Shaw's chances of becoming a more regular starter.

“I'm so proud of Jaedyn and the growth in her game. I've said it before, she can score a million goals for the work she does for the team, defensively, stands out to me that has been the biggest work on for her, I'm so pleased for her,” said Hayes.

The USWNT midfield is looking as good as it has in many years, and a big part of that is Yohannes's passing ability. The OL Lyonnes midfielder was at her quick-thinking best in the friendlies against Italy and finished the window with two assists. 

Yohannes wasn't given the start in the 3–0 win over Italy on Friday, but wasted no time in making an impact off the bench. Just five minutes after entering the match, Yohannes dinked a pass behind the Italian backline for Macario to run onto and score.

In the second match against Italy, Hayes opted to start Yohannes. The Macario-Yohannes connection was on display again. What's so impressive about Yohannes's second assist for Macario is the awareness to play the long pass early and to hit the exact space she knows her teammate can run into. The spin that Yohannes can get on the ball is something few players have in their tool belt.

When Yohannes plays, the pitch feels bigger. This latest window was yet another example of how the 18-year-old is becoming a key part of Hayes's plans. 

Cat Macario's last two games: vs. New Zealand: ⚽⚽vs. Italy: ⚽⚽ pic.twitter.com/VIWapa0RCA

With no tournaments or qualifying games in 2025, this year has been about gaining experience for young players.

Hayes has handed 27 players their first cap for the USWNT, with 16 earning their debuts in 2025. Jameese Joseph and Kate Wiesner were the latest two players to make their first appearances for the USWNT this week against Italy.

One of those 2025 rookies is 19-year-old center back Bugg, who impressed against Italy. Bugg earned the fifth cap of her career in the second friendly against Italy and played the full 90 minutes. She was brilliant, muting the Italian attack and earning the shutout.

However, while Bugg's calm demeanor on the ball under pressure is what makes her such a capable player, Hayes is not yet claiming that her place on the USWNT is guaranteed. The USWNT manager emphasized the improvement she wants to see from Bugg.

“Jordyn Bugg is a huge talent. Is she a player that is ready for now? No, I don't think she is. I think she's got great potential. She's a high-potential player that has to develop the experience to be able to play at the highest level, and that's why we play her in these situations,” Hayes said.“She's got to improve aerially at the top level. She knows that. We made that clear to the whole back line. Tonight, we'd only won 25% of our aerial duels, which was not acceptable.”

With the USWNT's No. 1 goalkeeper, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, unavailable due to an eye injury, this was a window where Mandy McGlynn could've had some time on the pitch. Instead, the Utah Royals goalkeeper was left as an unused substitute in both matches, and Claudia Dickey assumed the role of USWNT starter. 

For now, there appears to be a clear pecking order. Tullis-Joyce is the starter, Dickey is the backup and McGlynn is the No. 3. Hayes doesn't seem to see too much value in getting McGlynn minutes and would rather get Dickey comfortable should she need to keep deputizing, or even contend for the starting spot. 

Izzy Rodriguez is coming off a career year in the NWSL with the top-of-the-standings Kansas City Current. The 26-year-old left back played every match for the Current, led the league in assists (6) and was named in the NWSL Best XI of 2025.

But Rodriguez is entering a USWNT defensive pool that is highly competitive and brimming with young talent. Avery Patterson and Lilly Reale, who both earned their first caps for the USWNT in 2025, appeared to already be ahead of Rodriguez in Hayes's estimation. 

Despite being on the roster for these Italy friendlies, Rodriguez was not active for either match and did not play a single minute. This was a bit of a surprise and a bitter pill to swallow for any player with aspirations to impress.

Perhaps most surprisingly, Hayes opted to give Weisner her first USWNT start at left back against Italy  Monday night rather than try Rodriguez.

FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Catarina Macario scored in her third straight international match, and the United States women's national team defeated Italy, 2-0, on Monday night in their final game this year.

The United States has scored in 16 straight matches, including all 15 this year. The national team wrapped up 2025 with a 12-3-0 record. 

Macario scored the opening goal in the 20th minute with a strike from the corner of the box and up over Italy goalkeeper Francesca Durante's head and into the side netting of the far post.

Macario had a pair of goals in a 3-0 victory over Italy on Friday night in Orlando. Olivia Moultrie, who scored the other goal on Friday, was available off the bench Monday. 

“I really enjoyed the performances of these two games,” US coach Emma Hayes said, noting the contributions across the roster. “I think they're my favorite performances of the year.”

Macario, who plays for Chelsea, led the team this year with eight goals, including seven goals in her last seven starts. She nearly got a second goal at Ft. Lauderdale's Chase Stadium but it was disallowed because of a foul, denying her a third brace in her last three international games. 

Hayes celebrated Macario's goal on the sidelines, explaining how the forward had clearly regained her form after a series of unfortunate injuries over the past several years.

“That's what I was celebrating was, she's got a little swagger back and that matters to her, not to me, because I always think she puts in great performances. But I saw tonight that there really is another level to her to go,” Hayes said. “And I think I know she feels when she's in this environment she feels valued and seen and supported.”

Macario and Emily Fox were among the players named earlier Monday as nominees for the women's US Soccer Player of the Year award, joining Rose Lavelle, Alyssa Thompson, and Sam Coffey. 

Hayes made five changes to the starting lineup from Friday's victory in the first game against Italy, going with veterans Naomi Girma, Lindsey Heaps, Fox, and Macario. Three teenagers started for the United States, including 19-year-olds Claire Hutton and Jordyn Bugg, and 18-year-old Lily Yohannes. 

The US national team will next gather from Jan. 17-27 for the team's annual camp in Carson, Calif., with a match planned against Paraguay and another against an undetermined opponent.

Mauricio Pochettino's project with the USMNT is moving forward with high expectations ahead of the 2026 World Cup, but his long-term future looks increasingly uncertain. While the United States prepares to host the world's biggest football event, the Argentine coach is beginning to attract attention from major European clubs —a dynamic that could cut his American chapter shorter than expected.






Why Is His Post-World Cup Future Uncertain?


Pochettino's contract expires the moment the World Cup ends. And while national-team cycles often conclude naturally after major tournaments, there is another factor at play: his competitive DNA.

According to former U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel, speaking exclusively to GOAL, Pochettino is a “workaholic” who thrives on daily training, constant player interaction, and hands-on tactical work. None of that exists at the international level, where long stretches without matches or training camps are standard.

For someone who lives for the grind of club football, the national-team rhythm can feel limiting.


What Would Need to Happen for Pochettino to Stay?


Friedel's assessment for GOAL was brutally honest:



If the USMNT has a bad World Cup, Pochettino will not continue.
If the team has an excellent World Cup —or even goes all the way— he likely won't continue either, because top European clubs will immediately chase him.
Only a solid but not extraordinary tournament would realistically open the door for another cycle.



His continuity depends not only on results, but on how he envisions the next four years of his career.






Why Do European Clubs Want Him Back?



Pochettino hasn't hidden it: he misses the Premier League.
In an interview with the BBC, he described England's top flight as “the most competitive league in the world” and made clear that he intends to return to club football sooner rather than later.

His reputation remains untouched. Tottenham, PSG and Chelsea have all experienced his ability to reshape squads, develop young players and build strong football identities. After leading the USMNT on home soil at a globally watched World Cup, his name will be one of the hottest on the coaching market.

Friedel also emphasized a key point: the long periods without training during international duty can feel unnatural for someone as detail-oriented as Pochettino. The lack of daily work doesn't suit his personality.


¿Qué quiere realmente Pochettino?


Aunque disfruta del proyecto estadounidense y valora este momento en su carrera, también piensa en lo que viene: volver al ritmo diario, al vestuario constante, al pulso competitivo del fútbol europeo.


El resultado del Mundial marcará el tono, pero el escenario es evidente:
las puertas de Europa están abiertas y los clubes grandes lo esperan.

After Chelsea delivered a masterful performance against Paris Saint-Germain at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final in July, the trophy ceremony should have been a straightforward affair.

Standing on a raised dais on the pitch, Chelsea captain Reece James received the winner's trophy, as his teammates gathered around him for the climactic lift. But after presenting the championship trophy alongside FIFA president Gianni Infantino, Donald Trump continued to linger on stage, even as Infantino quietly departed.

The pause that followed was awkward enough to be visible on television, with Chelsea players glancing at one another as if unsure whether to wait for the American president to make his exit. Finally, goalkeeper Robert Sánchez, standing opposite Trump, gave James a signal to proceed.

What followed was a tableau both celebratory and oddly incongruous: Chelsea's jubilant squad clustered around their captain, the president of the United States standing directly at the center of the shot, as though he too were part of the team's triumph.

Chelsea may have stolen the show on the pitch, but Trump had found a way to remain the centre of attention.

The incident baffled several of the players, who couldn't make sense of the president's prolonged presence.

“I knew he was going to be here, but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy, so I was a bit confused,” said Cole Palmer, who was named the player of the tournament.

The absurdity did not end there. Footage from the celebration appeared to show Infantino giving Trump a winner's medal to look at, which he promptly pocketed in his suit blazer. Even the championship trophy was a replica of the original trophy that Trump insisted on keeping in the Oval Office.

Meanwhile, the event had all the makings of a Trump spectacle. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem – the woman responsible for the government's crackdown on immigration – were also in attendance alongside the president.

While the Club World Cup was billed as both the debut of FIFA's revamped tournament and a trial run for America's ability to host the 2026 World Cup, the event quickly revealed itself as something else entirely: a MAGA-tinged spectacle, blending politics, entertainment, and cultural symbolism in a way that feels more like an unabashed display of American exceptionalism than a sporting event..

Far from a neutral showcase of sporting infrastructure, it highlighted the unusually close ties between the U.S. government and FIFA's leadership and offered an unmistakable preview of how Trump and his administration are likely to leverage the World Cup for their “America First” ambitions.

The rise of Trump and Infantino after FIFA's corruption scandals

To understand how this dynamic took shape, we need to look at the parallel rise of Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino – two figures who built their power on controversy and populist appeal – and how their paths converged for the 2026 World Cup.

In May 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice unveiled a sweeping corruption case in world football. At its request, Swiss police raided the Baur au Lac hotel in Zurich during the FIFA Congress and arrested seven senior football officials. The same day, the FBI and IRS-CID searched CONCACAF's headquarters in Miami.

In total, 14 individuals – including FIFA officials and sports marketing executives – were charged with racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering involving more than USD 200 million in bribes and kickbacks.

The probe centred on claims that FIFA executives accepted millions of dollars in kickbacks in exchange for awarding lucrative media rights as well as the hosting rights for the World Cup. The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against more than a dozen officials, describing FIFA as operating like a criminal enterprise.

Among the most scrutinized deals were the bids that awarded the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar, which investigators alleged were marred by vote-buying schemes and financial inducements.

The scandal shook world football, leading to a wave of arrests in Zurich and the resignation of long-time FIFA president Sepp Blatter.

The following year marked a dramatic shift. In February 2016, Gianni Infantino was elected FIFA president, triumphing over the Asian Football Confederation President Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa by campaigning on a platform of reform and transparency. He promised to clean up the organisation's reputation and steer it away from the corruption scandals of the Blatter era.

“I want to be the president of all of you. I travelled through the globe and I will continue to do this. I want to work with all of you to restore and rebuild a new era where we can put football in the centre of the stage,” Infantino told the delegates following his victory. “Fifa has gone through sad times, moments of crisis. But those times are over.”

Nine months later, in November 2016, Trump was elected president of the United States of America, ushering in an administration with a very different approach to global engagement. Where the FBI investigation had framed FIFA as a case study in transnational crime and an example of U.S. willingness to police global institutions, Trump's administration had other plans. Instead of isolating FIFA, his administration would soon seek to work with its leadership.

Almost as soon as he arrived in the White House in early 2017, Trump and his administration began championing a goal far removed from policy briefings or legislative battles – winning the right to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

“They were calling me constantly to try to get me to come onboard, but it only took one call because when I heard “World Cup,” I wanted to do it,” Trump said during a August 2018 press conference with Infantino.

However, their ambition faced a major obstacle in the form of the infamous “Muslim ban”– Executive Order 13769 and its successors – that Trump signed in January 2017, effectively banning foreign nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from visiting the U.S.

The executive order was widely condemned as discriminatory and raised international doubts about the United States' suitability as a host nation. Aleksander Čeferin, then newly elected head of UEFA, European football's governing body, suggested that Trump's order could damage any US bid.

“If players cannot come because of political decisions, or populist decisions, then the World Cup cannot be played there,” he told the New York Times.

At the time, Infantino shared a similar opinion, arguing that the president's policy was incompatible with FIFA's regulations.

“Teams who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup. That is obvious,” Infantino said.

In an attempt at damage control, the Trump administration dispatched letters to FIFA affirming that “all eligible athletes, officials, and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination”.

The administration also revoked and replaced the Muslim ban policy with another executive order that Trump labeled the “watered down, politically correct version” of the initial ban. It would remain in effect until President Joe Biden revoked it in 2021.

In the end, a joint bid between the United States, Canada and Mexico was unveiled on April 10, 2017.

Key to securing this contentious win was Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser. Kushner's behind-the-scenes diplomacy included personal lobbying of Saudi and Bahraini leaders.

In a discreet 2017 visit to Saudi Arabia, Kushner reportedly stayed up until 4 a.m. negotiating with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to secure Saudi support - and influence other Gulf nations to back the U.S.-Canada-Mexico bid over favoured challenger Morocco.

His efforts were described as pivotal, even if publicly downplayed, with reports noting that Kushner repeatedly hosted the U.S. Soccer Federation at the White House to coordinate bid strategy.

Beyond the bid itself, Kushner remained instrumental in shaping the tournament's final logistics. According to The Athletic, he arranged a strategic lunch bringing together FIFA President Infantino, regional politicians, and major New York business leaders to anchor the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey – home of the 2026 final – as the centerpiece venue.

This kind of elite networking further cemented the infrastructure and political groundwork necessary for Trump's vision of the World Cup as a successful, high-profile national project.

“We're going to have to extend my second term because 2026 – I'm going to have to extend it for a couple of years,” Trump told the media before boarding the Marine One helicopter with Infantino in September 2019.

“I don't think any of you would have a problem with that. But I hope you're going to remember me in 2026.”

In May 2025 – four months into Trump's second term in office – the president hosted the first meeting of the newly minted 2026 World Cup task force.

Established to oversee preparations for the 2026 World Cup, the task force is chaired by Trump and includes most of his cabinet, including Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.

During the meeting, Trump boasted that the 2026 World Cup will be the “biggest, safest and most extraordinary soccer tournament in history.” During the same meeting, the vice president made clear the limits of hospitality for tourists who visit the US for the tournament.

“We want them to come. We want them to celebrate. We want them to watch the game. But, when the time is up, they have to go home. Otherwise, they'll have to talk to [DHS] Secretary Noem,” Vance said.

At the first meeting of the 2026 World Cup task force, the American president and vice president extended a warm welcome to football tourists – provided they go home, when the tournament is over. 

Vance's comments are in reference to one of the Trump administration's core policies: a mass deportation campaign targeting hundreds of thousands of immigrants and, in some cases, U.S. citizens. Under Noem's DHS leadership, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been carrying out raids on cities across the country, targeting everything from places of worship to Home Depot parking lots.

In some cases, the administration has used obscure laws such as the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to quickly deport suspected illegal immigrants with limited or no due process. Several hundred were sent to a high-security prison in El Salvador reserved for gang members.

As of April 2025, the Trump administration has claimed to have deported 140,000 people, though data suggests it is roughly half that amount. Nevertheless, the DHS claimed in August that 1.6 million “illegal aliens have left the U.S.”

The Trump administration's anti-immigrant crackdown even extended to football, as ICE agents attended matches during the Club World Cup.

“As is customary for an event of this magnitude with national security implications, ICE will be working alongside our Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice partners to help ensure the safety and security of the event,” an ICE spokesperson told The Miami Herald.

Beyond immigration, the Trump administration's gutting of federal institutions as part of its policy to reduce government spending will likely have a serious impact on the country's ability to successfully host the 2026 tournament.

According to the U.S. Travel Association, the country's air travel system is not built to handle the incoming surge of travellers expected ahead of the World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The association released a report in February 2025, which calls for security reforms, the modernisation of air traffic control technology, and improvements to visa processing.

And then there is the trade war that Trump launched against Canada, its closest ally, and Mexico – both of whom are co-hosts of the 2026 World Cup.

Beyond the economic concerns, Trump's trade war with the World Cup co-hosts goes against the spirit of an event that has long been propagated as a unifying force. It could also raise security concerns, as the breakdown in diplomatic relations could lead to obstacles in security coordination.

Nevertheless, both FIFA and Trump have continued to present the event as the greatest spectacle in sporting enterprise.

“America will welcome the world. There will be millions of people coming, Mr. President – millions of people,” Infantino said in March 2025.

“And, more than that, we will give joy and happiness to the entire world. And this is priceless, definitely. So, thank you, Mr. President for setting up this task force because it is important that everyone that comes to America feels safe, feels welcome, and that's why it's important that the government puts together this White House task force, chaired by the President (of the United States) himself.”

“Football needs responsible leadership, not emperors.”

So declared FIFPro, the global football players' union, after the 2025 Club World Cup. The statement came in response to FIFA president Gianni Infantino's decision to exclude the union from FIFA's discussions about player welfare during the Club World Cup final – another example of the autocratic tendencies that have defined his reign.

But Infantino's ambitions now extend far beyond football's internal politics. His most audacious gamble, the 2026 World Cup, has bound him to Donald Trump, for whom football is not just sport but a political instrument.

Trump has always understood sport as a battlefield in the American culture wars. He attacked kneeling NFL players as “unpatriotic,” cast the NBA as “disrespectful,” and presented himself as the lone defender of a traditional, flag-waving vision of American sport. Football, the world's game, offers him something different: not just a domestic wedge issue but a global spectacle that can be reframed to serve his nationalist narrative.

For Trump, the 2026 World Cup is the perfect stage. It allows him to claim credit for bringing the world to America, to present the U.S. as the indispensable host nation, and to contrast “American greatness” with what he depicts as weak, declining Europe or unstable Latin America.

He can drape the event in patriotic symbols, insist that it proves his “America First” agenda works, and use the tournament's massive audiences to dominate the domestic political conversation in an election cycle.

Infantino quickly realised Trump's utility. He cultivated a political bromance with the U.S. president – attending his inauguration, visiting him in the Oval Office, joining him on a Middle East jaunt, and offering gifts tailored to flatter the president's ego. He even won over the Democratic-led cities that will host the majority of the matches without upsetting his White House allies.

Infantino is a consummate political operator, untroubled by the company he keeps so long as it serves his ambitions. He partnered with the Kremlin to stage the 2018 World Cup, leaned on Qatar's monarchy to deliver the 2022 edition, and has since aligned himself with Saudi Arabia and its de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman – whose backing has underwritten Infantino's grand projects, including the expanded Club World Cup.

Infantino's relationship with Trump is similarly transactional but essential: Infantino needs Trump's blessing to secure FIFA's place in America, and Trump needs Infantino to deliver the kind of global spectacle he can rebrand as an American triumph.

The mutual dependence is stark. Infantino sees the U.S. as the crown jewel of his “new era of football,” the market that can deliver both revenues and legitimacy. Trump sees FIFA as a propaganda machine – an organisation willing to let him bask in stadium ceremonies, claim symbolic victories, and turn football into another front in the culture wars.

If NFL players' protests made them villains in Trump's narrative, the World Cup offers him an opposite symbol: foreign athletes and fans flocking to America, paying tribute – whether willingly or not – to its greatness.

Nevertheless, Infantino's bet on Trump and the 2026 World Cup isn't a guaranteed win.

Trump's crackdown on immigration could chill international attendance figures and weaken the football czar's claims that the tournament will be biggest spectacle the sport has ever seen. The ongoing trade war between the U.S. and its neighbours and fellow co-hosts Canada and Mexico, could also have a serious impact on the event, dispelling the notion of “unity” that FIFA preaches.

Still, Infantino has defended his closeness with Trump, insisting that maintaining the relationship is essential to the World Cup's success. In doing so, he has tethered FIFA's future to the whims of a president who has weaponized sport as a pillar of his MAGA ideology. For Trump, football is not merely a game but a stage – an opportunity to reinforce his political narrative, to claim credit for the tournament's scale and spectacle.

The World Cup will be marketed as a celebration of football. But at its core, it is a political pact: Infantino's empire depends on Trump's blessing, and Trump's nationalist project finds the perfect megaphone in Infantino's FIFA.

How Does Saudi Arabia Arrive to This Game?


Saudi Arabia enters as one of the natural contenders for the title. Their structure has been consistent throughout the tournament: a solid defensive block, aggressive pressing, wide fullbacks and a midfield that sets the rhythm.

Updated Dec 02, 2025, 11:00 PM

PARIS, Dec 2 - Debutants will take centre stage at Friday's 2026 World Cup draw along with concerns over heat, player welfare and the practical challenge of staging football's biggest tournament across three countries during the peak of a North American summer.

For the first time in the tournament's history, 48 teams will be divided into 12 groups of four at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., producing a 104-match schedule across 16 host cities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Soccer's world governing body FIFA has framed the expansion as a watershed moment for inclusivity, opening the door for nations that had never qualified before -- Cape Verde, Uzbekistan, Jordan and Curacao, which, with a population of 150,000, is by far the smallest nation to take part. 

Others, such as Haiti, return after long waits while Italy still need a playoff to try to avoid the embarrassment of missing out on their third World Cup in a row.

The scale of the tournament is heightening scrutiny over conditions for players and supporters, particularly in venues where summer temperatures regularly climb into the high 30s Celsius (mid-90s Fahrenheit).

U.S. host cities, notably in the Midwest, the Southeast and parts of the Southwest, are expected to experience extreme heat and high humidity during June and July, with thunderstorms potentially wreaking havoc with the schedule.

This year's Club World Cup in the U.S. served as a dress rehearsal and scorching heat was a major concern.

Medical experts and players' unions have raised fears of heat stress, dehydration and reduced recovery times, especially in a format where sides may need to play up to eight matches to lift the trophy – one more than in the 32-team events of the past.

FIFA has highlighted the use of indoor or retractable-roof stadiums, including venues in Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and Vancouver, as a key mitigation measure, allowing organisers to control temperatures for a portion of the match programme.

EUROPEAN AUDIENCES

However, many fixtures will still be held in open-air stadiums where cooling systems are not an option and where adjusting kickoffs may be the only immediate protection.

Those kickoff times are not straightforward. Broadcasters are seeking prime-time slots for European and Asian audiences, which could push matches into afternoon hours locally, when the heat is most intense.

Balancing commercial demands with player safety has become one of the central logistical puzzles of the tournament. Venue assignments and start times will only be revealed the day after Friday's draw, when FIFA unveils the updated match schedule.

The ceremony will place teams into four seeding pots based on world rankings and continental rules. The three hosts are seeded into separate groups alongside top-ranked nations such as defending champions Argentina, Spain, France and England.

Provided they win their groups, those teams cannot meet until the later knockout rounds.

POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY

The draw also comes against the backdrop of renewed political uncertainty in the U.S. following the return of Donald Trump to the White House, raising questions over security coordination, immigration protocols and visa processing for teams, officials and travelling supporters.

FIFA has sought to reassure participating nations that operational planning across the three host countries remains unaffected, though the tournament's scale relies heavily on smooth cross-border logistics and consistent entry procedures.

Iran has said it will boycott the draw ceremony in protest at the limited allocation of visas for the Iranian delegation.

FIFA, which said on Monday the 42 teams who had qualified so far would attend, has not responded to requests for comment from Reuters.

For the many debutants and smaller nations appearing in the finals thanks to the tournament's expansion, heat management may be as big a competitive factor as tactical preparation.

For heavyweights chasing the trophy, the draw will determine not only their opponents but also the intensity of the physical road ahead.

Some venues offer climate-controlled environments but in other places squads will be exposed to daytime heat stress and longer flights between matches, variables that could shape squad selection and rotation strategies.

The final will be staged at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey in July, capping a tournament FIFA president Gianni Infantino has billed as ""the most inclusive World Cup ever"". Yet inclusivity comes at the cost of scale and scale brings complexity.

As the draw is made in Washington, coaches will be searching less for big-name adversaries than for manageable logistics. 

Controlling exposure to the heat may prove as decisive as avoiding the tournament's biggest footballing powers, especially for the teams simply trying to survive the opening rounds in conditions few have faced before.

The new format has also diluted one of the traditional sources of tension in World Cup draws, with the proliferation of groups and protected seeds making the emergence of a true ""Group of Death"" very unlikely, and reducing the sense of immediate jeopardy that has typically surrounded the ceremony.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup, hosted across the United States, Mexico, and Canada, could mark a turning point in global officiating. FIFA is evaluating significant adjustments to the VAR protocol, aiming to reduce mistakes in decisive actions and elevate refereeing accuracy on the sport's biggest stage.
According to reporting from The Times, the proposed changes would drastically reshape the role of video review at the tournament.


The 2026 FIFA World Cup, hosted across the United States, Mexico, and Canada, could mark a turning point in global officiating. FIFA is evaluating significant adjustments to the VAR protocol, aiming to reduce mistakes in decisive actions and elevate refereeing accuracy on the sport's biggest stage.
According to reporting from The Times, the proposed changes would drastically reshape the role of video review at the tournament.


What New Situations Would VAR Be Allowed to Review?


The standout proposal is a major expansion of the protocol that would allow VAR to review corner-kick decisions and second yellow cards — two areas traditionally off-limits for video intervention.


Under current rules, the VAR cannot correct an incorrectly awarded corner or an unjust second booking, even when such decisions directly influence the match.
The intention is simple: avoid unfair expulsions and ensure that set pieces leading to goals or major moments stem from correct decisions.

The intention is simple: avoid unfair expulsions and ensure that set pieces leading to goals or major moments stem from correct decisions.

If approved, this evolution of VAR would mirror FIFA's approach in 2017, when new protocols were tested ahead of their global implementation.


What Is IFAB's Position on These Changes?



The International Football Association Board (IFAB) — the body responsible for the Laws of the Game — had already initiated this discussion.
During an October virtual meeting of its Technical and Football Advisory Panels (FAP–TAP), IFAB acknowledged the need to allow VAR to intervene when a player receives an incorrect second yellow card, one of the most controversial gaps in the current system.

A formal proposal will be presented on January 20, 2026, during IFAB's annual meeting in London. If approved, the World Cup would become the ideal testing ground before any permanent rule change.






What Other Measures Is FIFA Testing to Combat Time-Wasting?



In parallel, FIFA will experiment with a new regulation at the Arab Cup in Qatar.
The rule states that any player receiving medical attention on the field must leave the pitch for two minutes, unless the foul committed against him resulted in a yellow or red card.

The rule states that any player receiving medical attention on the field must leave the pitch for two minutes, unless the foul committed against him resulted in a yellow or red card.

The logic behind the measure is twofold:


• limit intentional delays,
• prevent teams from using medical stoppages as disguised tactical timeouts.


• limit intentional delays,
• prevent teams from using medical stoppages as disguised tactical timeouts.

If the experiment proves effective, the rule could influence future international tournaments.


Why Do These Changes Matter for the 2026 World Cup?


Because 2026 will be the largest World Cup in history, featuring 48 teams, more matches than ever before, and unprecedented global attention. In such a massive tournament, every refereeing mistake becomes magnified.

FIFA's objective is clear: minimize controversy and strengthen competitive fairness in an event that stretches across three countries and presents an enormous logistical challenge.

What's unfolding is a deep modernization of the officiating protocol. And if the trials succeed, the 2026 World Cup could become the edition that permanently redefines how VAR is used in global football.

World Cup

A new bill will be introduced to the United States House of Representatives on Tuesday which seeks to authorize $50million worth of federal funding every year for host cities to use towards transportation and infrastructure of major sporting events.

A draft of the bill, which has been seen by The Athletic, will be introduced by Rep. Rick Larsen, a Democrat who represents Washington's second congressional district. He is also the co-chair of the Congressional Soccer Caucus. In a phone call with The Athletic, he said the bill will be jointly introduced by Republican Rep. Burgess Owens, indicating bipartisan support for the initiative.

Mr. Larsen's home state of Washington will host six games during the men's World Cup in 2026, including the United States men's national team's (USMNT) second group stage game and two knockout games. Rep. Owens may have a local interest because his home state of Utah will host the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City in 2034.

The bill will be known as the ‘Transportation Assistance for Olympic and World Cup Cities Act of 2025'.

Qualifying events would include the Olympics, Paralympics or Special Olympics, as well as the men's and women's FIFA World Cups, plus any multi-day international sporting events as determined by the transportation secretary. The bill will ask for $50m to be authorized for each fiscal year. The amount that can be given to an individual host city will be capped at $10m and the bill says that the administration should “allocate amounts evenly to each host metropolitan planning organization” for an event.

The 2026 men's World Cup, co-hosted by U.S., Canada and Mexico, will be spread across 11 host cities in the U.S.: New York/New Jersey, Boston, Philadelphia, Miami, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco Bay Area.

Hundreds of millions of U.S. tax dollars have already been committed to the World Cup and Olympics. Earlier this year, President Trump's domestic policy bill — coined as ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill' — set aside $625m in federal funding to aid the security costs of hosting the World Cup in 2026. The bill also included an additional $500 million to be made available for “state and local capabilities to detect, identify, track or monitor threats from unmanned aircraft systems (otherwise known as drones)”, which has also become a key security concern for World Cup stadiums and fan festivals. The bill also included $1billion set aside for security, planning and other costs related to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, California.

The World Cup host cities, as per their contracts with FIFA, are expected to carry many of the security costs for the tournament, both at stadiums and in surrounding areas. Many have already dipped into the pockets of city and state taxpayers and funds and sought private support and donations. The vast majority of revenue from the World Cup also goes to FIFA, including ticketing, parking, in-stadium sponsorship and hospitality packages. Host cities are able to sell local sponsorships for fan festivals.

The costs of hosting the tournament are starting to mount for local authorities. As previously reported by The Athletic, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, who represents New Jersey, has previously said MetLife Stadium has already spent $37m on upgrades to enable it to host the final and that New Jersey will take on “$65m in costs for things like transit security for all hubs, bridges, tunnels, and airports”.

Miami-Dade County has already approved $46m for services associated with the World Cup. The spend on local taxpayer dollars has received some pushback, particularly after the Miami-Dade mayor previously asked county departments to make submissions for 10 per cent spending cuts.

Rep. Rick Larsen, however, insists that the economic impact of the World Cup means taxpayers dollars should receive a healthy return.

“I would point to Seattle, which projects the minimum $929million that'll be generated just in King County alone over six World Cup matches,” he said on Monday.

The report of this estimate was made by Oxford Economics, which was contracted by Visit Seattle, the official marketing organization of Seattle and King County.

Mr. Larsen says the broader region will have additional benefits for hotels, restaurants and day-trips. He says: “I can't tell you there's give me a one for one investment – that'll all be decided after the games are done – but we're looking at hosting a Super Bowl sized game every day for three weeks in the United States. That's going to require a massive investment to make this happen.

“The U.S. is benefiting from having people come to the United States and having the best that we can offer. I hope we offer our best, both on the field and off the field. The investment of $50million a year is somewhat peanuts compared to the potential return on investment in return.”

He added: “Host cities are finding they're in varying states of readiness. This isn't just for World Cup. It is a bill thinking for a long term about the need cities have when these large sporting events come to the U.S. and need help.”

Mr. Larsen says that the target is to get the funding into the appropriations bill for transportation by the end of January to ensure it passes through the House, the Senate and the White House in time for the World Cup.

Mr. Larsen also played down concerns that games could yet be relocated from World Cup host cities, amid concerns expressed by President Donald Trump about safety in cities run by Democrat mayors.

“We do big events there all the time,” he said, insisting Seattle is safe and bristling at what he called the President's “empty threats”.

He added: “Big soccer games happen there. We had 70,000 people at the Leagues Cup final between Seattle and Miami. It went great.”

Rep. Owens, the Republican who is jointly introducing the bill, said: “As the host of the 2002 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, Utah knows how to welcome the world, and we're gearing up to do it again in 2034.

“I'm proud to be Utah's top advocate on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and to co-lead this effort to give host cities across America the dependable federal partner they need while preparing to host major international sporting events like the Olympics and World Cup. This support strengthens transportation planning, boosts local collaboration, and ensures the United States is ready to shine on the global stage.”

Ahead of the FIFA World
Cup 2026 draw on Friday 5 December, the Opta supercomputer has
produced its early predictions for this summer's tournament in
North America. Here are the
results.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw takes place in Washington D.C. on 5
December, allowing fans of all nations to start plotting their
routes to a possible coronation at New Jersey's MetLife
Stadium.

Sixteen venues across the United States, Canada and Mexico will
play host to the biggest-ever edition of the tournament, with the
number of teams increasing from 32 and 48 and the tally of games
upped from 64 to 104.

Six of the teams appearing at the tournament are still to be
decided, with four qualifying via the UEFA play-offs and another
two via the inter-confederation playoffs.

But most of the favourites are set, with Lionel Messi hoping to
help Argentina become the first team since Brazil in 1962 to
successfully defend their crown.

Argentina, though, will face fierce competition, not least from
2022 runners-up France and reigning European champions Spain.

England and Brazil, meanwhile, will hope the appointments of
Thomas Tuchel and Carlo Ancelotti prove inspired decisions.

Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal should not be discounted, while the
three host nations will be desperate to make their mark.

And what of a Norway team spearheaded by Manchester City goal
machine Erling Haaland?

Ahead of this week's draw, we have taken a deep dive into the
Opta supercomputer's first set of World Cup predictions to assess
who is most likely to lift the trophy.

At Euro 2024, Luis de la Fuente's Spain produced one of the most
eye-catching international tournament successes in recent
memory.

La Roja swept all before them, winning six of their seven
matches inside 90 minutes and only requiring extra-time to
eliminate hosts Germany in the quarter-final. They scored 15 goals
in the tournament – four more than anyone else.

And there has been no downturn from De la Fuente's side since.
Spain are now unbeaten in their last 31 competitive games (W25 D6,
excluding penalty shootouts), beating the famous 30-match run they
enjoyed under Vicente del Bosque between 2010 and 2013 – a streak
that saw them win both the World Cup and the Euros.

By the time the next international break comes around in March,
it'll be three years since Spain last lost a competitive match.
That defeat came away at Scotland on 28 March 2023 in a Euro 2024
qualifier (2-0).

It is little surprise, then, that Spain are our predictive
model's early World Cup favourites, going all the way in 17.0% of
tournament predictions.

If Spain are to triumph, it is likely Lamine Yamal will play a
key role. Their Euro 2024 triumph came the day after Yamal's 17th
birthday, as he replaced Pelé (1958, 17 years, 249 days) as the
youngest player to feature in a World Cup or European Championship
final.

Yamal created the most chances at the tournament, with 19, while
only teammate Nico Williams (2.1) had more expected assists (xA)
than his 2.0.

Spain will be closely monitoring the progress of Rodri, with the
midfielder playing just 294 minutes in the Premier League for Man
City since tearing his anterior cruciate ligament last year.
Barcelona duo Pedri and Gavi will also look to prove their fitness
after injury-disrupted starts to 2025-26.

But if their key players enter the tournament in good health,
Spain will be supremely confident of repeating their feat from
2008-12 of holding the Euros and World Cup trophies at the same
time.

The 2026 World Cup will mark the end of an era in French
football, with Didier Deschamps set to stand down from his role as
Les Bleus' head coach after 14 years at the helm. He will hope to
go out with a bang and cement his legacy as France's greatest
boss.

Deschamps' reign has comprised 175 games, so if they reach the
first knockout round, he will have overseen 100 games more than
France's next-longest serving boss (Raymond Domenech, 79).

After watching his team fall agonisingly short on penalties
against Argentina in Qatar, he has another chance to become only
the second coach to win multiple World Cups (after Vittorio Pozzo
in 1934 and 1938).

Deschamps also lifted the trophy as a player when he was captain
in 1998 and this will be Kylian Mbappé's first World Cup as France
skipper.

The Real Madrid sensation will be targeting individual and team
records.

Mbappé is closing in on Olivier Giroud's mark of 57 goals for
France, having netted 55 times in his 93 caps. There is a good
chance that record falls before the World Cup, but he is also
chasing down Miroslav
Klose's all-time total of 16 goals at World Cups, having netted
12 times in just two editions of the tournament (four in 2018,
eight in 2022).

Messi (13) is one goal ahead of Mbappé, who will surely take
possession of the record eventually. But the prospect of two icons
duelling to end the tournament in the lead should be absorbing
viewing.

France also boast the player recently crowned the world's best,
and it is not Mbappé. Ousmane Dembélé won the 2025 Ballon d'Or
after spearheading Paris Saint-Germain's run to a first UEFA
Champions League crown, scoring 33 goals and recording 13 assists
in 2024-25 from a central attacking role.

Finding a way to get Mbappé and Dembélé to function in the same
attack will be one of the major conundrums facing Deschamps.

With a 14.1% chance, France are the supercomputer's second
favourites, just behind Spain, who beat them 5-4 in the semi-finals
of the UEFA Nations League in June.

The only one other team assigned more than a one-in-10 chance of
becoming world champions is England, who are out to end 60 years of
hurt at major tournaments.

The Three Lions enter their first – and potentially only –
tournament under Tuchel as third favourites with a 11.8%
probability of lifting the trophy, having come up short in two
European Championship finals under Gareth Southgate.

Tuchel's task is simple – get international football's nearly
men over the line. He could become only the third manager to win
both the UEFA Champions League and the World Cup, after Marcello
Lippi (Juventus, Italy) and Del Bosque (Real Madrid, Spain).

His England reign took some time to get going, as England
laboured past Albania (3-0), Latvia (2-0), Andorra (1-0 and 2-0)
and were beaten 3-1 by Senegal in a June friendly.

But a rampant 5-0 victory in Serbia in September showcased the
Three Lions' potential, and the emergence of Elliot Anderson seems
to have finally ended their search for a central midfield partner
for Declan Rice.

England ultimately finished Group K with eight wins – and eight
clean sheets – from as many matches, becoming only the second team
to win all their games in a UEFA World Cup qualifying campaign
without conceding after Yugoslavia in 1954.

Southgate's England teams were also solid at the back but rarely
free-flowing. At Euro 2024, they recorded just 5.4 xG – Turkey,
Austria and Switzerland were among the teams to better that
tally.

So, Tuchel is also expected to provide better entertainment, and
he certainly has the tools to do so, with a stunning array of
options to choose from, particularly in the attacking midfield
positions.

There should be plenty of service for Harry Kane, who is
Europe's most in-form striker, netting 24 goals in 20 matches for
Bayern Munich since the start of the season in August. But there is
a competitive race for the positions behind the England skipper
after Tuchel suggested Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden could not
both start, while Cole Palmer's season has barely got going due to
injuries.

Given the way England often toiled at Euro 2024, Tuchel's
refusal to crowbar in the big names could come as a breath of fresh
air, and the likes of Eberechi Eze and Morgan Rogers are staking
impressive claims.

In the eyes of Argentina's supporters, Messi struggled to emerge
from Diego Maradona's shadow until the 2022 World Cup.

But the Barcelona legend produced one of the greatest individual
World Cup campaigns, scoring seven goals and assisting three, while
becoming the first player to ever net in the group stage, last 16,
quarter-finals, semi-finals and final of a single edition.

Messi also led all players in Qatar for shots (32), chances
created from open play (17) and fouls won (22), becoming the
second player to top all three metrics at a single World Cup. The
other? Maradona in 1986 (30 shots, 19 open-play chances created, 53
fouls won).

Now, he gets the opportunity to do something even Maradona could
not accomplish – win a second World Cup.

Messi has shown no signs of slowing down, helping Inter Miami
reach the Major League Soccer Cup final while contributing a
staggering 35 goals and providing 21 assists in MLS action this
year.

The attacker 
already leads all players for appearances (26) and goal
involvements (21, since assists were first recorded in 1966) at
World Cups, while Messi's battle to break Klose's goal record
before Mbappé is an enthralling additional storyline.

Argentina dominated the CONMEBOL World Cup qualification group,
finishing nine points clear of second-placed Ecuador, and last year
they also retained the Copa América for the first time since
1993.

A lack of recent match practice against top-class European
opponents could count against the Albiceleste, who also saw Ángel
Di María retire from international football after the Copa
América.

But the likes of Enzo Fernández and Julián Alvarez have kicked
on in the last two years, and any team which has Messi has a chance
of going all the way – a creditable 8.7% chance, according to the
supercomputer.

Germany are the supercomputer's fifth favourites with a 7.1%
chance of winning a record-equalling fifth World Cup.

But by the time next year's tournament rolls around, it will
have been 12 years since Germany played a knockout game at a World
Cup. That was when they beat Argentina in the 2014 final.

Julian Nagelsmann's side were beaten in the quarter-finals on
home soil at Euro 2024, marking the first time Germany have
appeared at four major tournaments (World Cup/Euros) in a row
without reaching a semi-final at any of them.

Their route to this World Cup was not completely smooth, either,
as they were left needing victory over Slovakia in their final
Group A game to avoid the play-offs. But they won that match by a
statement 6-0 scoreline, with Nick Woltemade, Serge Gnabry and
Leroy Sané among the goals.

Germany arguably played some of the best football at Euro 2024,
ranking second for average possession (62.5%) and goals scored
(11), but Nagelsmann has plenty of selection dilemmas to
consider.

Marc-André ter Stegen has lost his place as Barcelona's
first-choice goalkeeper after undergoing back surgery, while
Nagelsmann has tested multiple midfield pairings since Toni Kroos'
retirement – Aleksandar Pavlović partnered Leon Goretzka in the
final two qualifiers.

Germany have at least scraped into Pot 1 for the group-stage
draw, taking the 12th and final spot among the top seeds, ahead of
Croatia, and despite question marks it would be rash not to
consider them as contenders at this stage.

When Cristiano Ronaldo swapped Manchester United for Al-Nassr
after the 2022 World Cup, some may have expected it to be a case
of, ‘out of sight, out of mind'.

But the five-time Ballon d'Or winner simply cannot stop making
headlines, with FIFA recently announcing Ronaldo would not serve
the typical three-match ban following his red card in Portugal's
defeat to the Republic of Ireland, freeing him up to play their
World Cup opener.

And after Messi finally ended his wait for a World Cup win in
Qatar, Portugal are assigned a 6.6% chance of giving Ronaldo his
own crowning moment.

Portugal boast, on paper, one of the most talented squads at the
tournament. Vitinha, João Neves and Nuno Mendes all enjoyed
spectacular 2024-25 campaigns with PSG, while EPL stars Rúben Dias,
Bernardo Silva and Bruno Fernandes make up a technically-gifted and
highly-experienced spine.

But when the tournament begins, the likelihood is that Ronaldo
will hog the headlines, just as he did in Qatar in 2022 and at Euro
2024. At the former tournament, Ronaldo was dropped for a last-16
tie against Switzerland after a series of ineffective displays, and
his replacement Gonçalo Ramos scored a hat-trick in a 6-1 win.

Then, in Germany, Ronaldo broke down in tears after seeing a
penalty saved in Portugal's last-16 tie against Slovenia, which
they eventually won on spot-kicks.

Portugal went out to France at the next stage, as Ronaldo ended
the tournament without a goal from 23 shots and 3.6 xG – the
second-highest tally at the competition.

Like Messi, 
Ronaldo will appear at a record-breaking sixth edition of the World
Cup, but of his eight goals in 22 games at the tournament,
three have been penalties and none have come in the knockout
stages.

However, this year's Nations League triumph offers significant
hope that Roberto Martínez can get the balance right even while
accommodating the 40-year-old, who is still full of confidence
after scoring 84 goals in 86 Saudi Pro League games.

Fans have learned to never write Ronaldo off, and however
Portugal's campaign goes, it is unlikely to be dull.

Brazil are the only side to qualify for every edition of the
World Cup, though the Seleção cut things a little too fine this
time around, finishing fifth in CONMEBOL's qualifiers.

Ancelotti was only in charge for the final five games of their
campaign, but less than eight months into his reign, he has already
overseen surprise defeats to Bolivia and Japan, as well as poor
draws with Ecuador and Tunisia.

Next year, it will have
been 24 years since Brazil last lifted the World Cup. They have
only endured one previous drought of that length since first
winning the tournament in 1958, between 1970 and 1994.

That previous dry spell ended, of course, in the United States,
and Brazil are assigned a 5.6% chance of another stateside
triumph.

If Brazil are to go all the way, Ancelotti must find a way to
get more out of Vinícius Júnior.

Vinícius has played under five different head coaches since
joining Real Madrid, and 149 of his 192 goal involvements for the
club came during Ancelotti's second spell in charge of Los
Blancos.

Estêvão's flying start to life with Chelsea gives Brazil another
electric option out wide, though it remains to be seen whether
Ancelotti will bow to pressure to recall Neymar – if he proves his
fitness – for his first appearance since 2023, amid the forward's
persistent injury issues.

Brazil have consistently underwhelmed in recent years, failing
to get past the last eight at the two most recent World Cups and
the 2024 Copa América, but if any manager can get them to perform
on the big stage in a knockout tournament, it's Ancelotti.

The Netherlands have reached the most World Cup finals without
ever lifting the trophy (three), and they are the eighth and final
team assigned more than a 5% chance of triumphing next year, at
5.2%.

The Oranje's run to the semi-finals of Euro 2024 – losing late
on to England – was their best at any tournament since finishing
third at the 2014 World Cup.

Their current side has a distinctly English influence, with four
Premier League players scoring in their final World Cup qualifier
versus Lithuania (4-0, Tijjani Reijnders, Cody Gakpo, Xavi Simons
and Donyell Malen) – the first time that has occurred for the
Netherlands.

Ronald Koeman has restored the traditional Dutch 4-3-3 system
and has been rewarded with some positive performances against elite
opponents.

One recurring issue in recent years has been their lack of a
true centre-forward. But Memphis Depay remains a talisman for his
nation, becoming their all-time leading scorer when he netted his
51st international goal in September.

The Netherlands may lack the star power of the other main
favourites and are slipping under the radar with many, but the
supercomputer thinks they are worthy of consideration.

France became the sixth team to win the World Cup as hosts in
1998, but no side has accomplished the feat since then.

Even the most ardent supporters of the United States, Mexico or
Canada would struggle to make the case for a home triumph in 2026,
but with a little luck in the draw, you never know.

Eleven of the tournament's venues are in the USA, and Mauricio
Pochettino's side are assigned a 0.9% chance of going all the way.
They will be placed in Group D, with two of their first-round games
taking place in Los Angeles and the other in Seattle.

The USMNT appointed Pochettino after of a humiliating
group-stage exit as Copa América hosts last year, and things did
not immediately improve as the Argentine lost five of his first 10
matches at the helm.

Pochettino's side did reach the final of the 2025 CONCACAF Gold
Cup, despite star names including Christian Pulisic, Weston
McKennie, Folarin Balogun and Antonee Robinson missing the
tournament.

Pochettino has had no choice but to experiment – in November,
Giovani Reyna's return to the squad saw him become the 51st player
to start a game for the USMNT in 2025.

Along with the Gold Cup run, a 5-1 win over Uruguay last time
out put Pochettino's critics on notice, and the USA should feel
good about their chances of being competitive in the knockout
stages.

Mexico, the team that defeated the USA in the Gold Cup final,
are the host nation viewed as most likely to shock the world and
lift the trophy, with a 1.3% probability.  

It remains to be seen how the introduction of a round of 32 will
affect El Tri, who lost in the round of 16 at seven consecutive
World Cups before suffering a group-stage exit in Qatar.

Javier Aguirre's team will play in the tournament's opening
match, in Mexico City on 11 June, but they failed to win any of
their final six games in 2025 (D3 L3) – all of them friendlies –
with five of those coming against teams lower than them in the FIFA
World Rankings.

There will likely be an experienced feel to their squad, led by
Fulham striker Raúl Jiménez, who is only eight away from Javier
Hernández's all-time Mexico goal record of 52.

But it remains to be seen whether 
40-year-old goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa will earn a historic
call-up. He is the third player – alongside Messi and Ronaldo –
able to appear at an unprecedented sixth edition of the World Cup
and was selected for the Gold Cup, so watch this space.

Canada are deemed the least likely of the host nations to go all
the way, winning the tournament in just 0.4% of our simulations,
though they are only a year removed from a historic tournament
run.

Mere weeks into Jesse Marsch's reign, Canada reached the
semi-finals on their Copa América debut, losing 2-0 to eventual
winners Argentina. Only a penalty shootout denied them a bronze
medal, as they lost to Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay in the third-place
play-off.

But a stunning defeat to Guatemala, in another shootout, ended
Canada's Gold Cup campaign at the quarter-final stage and brought
them crashing down to earth.

If Canada are to spring a surprise on home soil (their Group B
fixtures will all be played in Toronto or Vancouver), they will
need Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies to be in peak condition,
having been sidelined with an anterior cruciate ligament injury
since March.

In addition to the top eight favourites, there are two other
teams given at least a 2% chance of winning the World Cup –
Norway (2.3%) and Colombia
(2.0%).

Norway will be the team nobody wishes to draw from Pot 3, having
steamrolled their way through the UEFA qualifiers with a perfect
eight wins and 37 goals – the most of any team.  

Haaland struck 16 of those goals, matching Robert Lewandowski's
2018 record for the most prolific UEFA World Cup qualification
campaign. Lewandowski scored his tally in 10 games, two more than
Haaland.

Colombia also deserve their lofty status in our
projections, as they come in the tournament off the back of a run
to the final of the 2024 Copa América, having outscored all other
teams at that tournament with 12 goals.

The resurgence of James Rodríguez made headlines at that
competition, as he led the way for chances created (20) and assists
(six) – that latter tally equalled the record for a single edition,
alongside Brazil's Alex in 2003.

Those teams round out the top 10 favourites, with
Belgium next with a 1.9% probability. Many members
of the Red Devils' ‘Golden Generation' remain in the fold, even if
the years are starting to catch up with them.

Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, now teammates at Napoli, and
Thibaut Courtois will all feature at a fourth edition of the World
Cup – no player has ever represented Belgium at more (Enzo Scifo
also four).

This will be Rudi Garcia's first tournament in charge since
replacing Domenico Tedesco in January, and even if Belgium are no
longer the force they once were – they drew three of their eight
qualifiers and only finished two points ahead of Wales – they
remain a threat.

Croatia are another team whose best days may be
behind them but can never be ruled out. Semi-finalists in both 2018
and 2022, they are assigned a 1.1% chance of glory – lower than
Mexico and Uruguay (1.7%), whose coach Bielsa
recently went on a rant in a press conference following speculation
over his position.

Inspirational Croatia captain Luka Modrić is hoping to appear at
his fifth World Cup at the age of 40, and no team will want to see
Croatia drawn into their group from Pot 2.

Morocco (1.1%) and Ecuador
(1.0%) are the other teams with a greater than 1% chance of glory,
with Japan (0.9%) and USA just behind.

And of course, there are also six teams still to be decided in
March's play-offs. There is currently a combined 3.7% chance of any
of those sides going all the way, with Italy
surely the most likely candidates if they can end their World Cup
exile.

When the tournament begins, it will have been 20 years since the
Azzurri played a knockout match at the World Cup – with their most
recent such game being the 2006 final.

They must get past Northern Ireland and
potentially Wales to make it, with both of those
sides hoping to join fellow home nations England and
Scotland.

Appearing at their first World Cup since 1998, the Tartan Army
are given a 0.2% chance of lifting the trophy, level with the likes
of South Africa, Australia,
Iran and Tunisia.

Sweden (in 1958) and Czechia
(in 1934 and 1962) have both been World Cup finalists previously
(the latter as Czechoslovakia) but could still miss the tournament,
as could former European champions Denmark.

If previous World Cups are anything to go by, shocks and
surprises should be a given, so all those teams will still be
dreaming of a deep run.

With 48 teams taking part, there also will be some new names
gracing the tournament.

Debutants Uzbekistan are seen as having a
slightly better chance of impressing than the other new nations, as
they have a 0.2% chance of going all the way. A more realistic aim
might be getting through the groups after impressing in AFC
qualification – beating out sides like Qatar and United Arab
Emirates.

Cape Verde (0.1%) have qualified and are the
second-smallest nation by population (after Iceland in 2018) to
achieve the feat. They fared slightly better with our model than
the other first-timers Curaçao and
Jordan (both 0.04%).

Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Panama and New
Zealand all could be in for a difficult summer as they
have the same rating as Cape Verde (all 0.1%).

As things stand, the least likely nation to prevail after coming
out bottom in our simulations is Haiti (0.03%), who have qualified
for the first time since 1974, but it already looks clear there are
going to be some brilliant stories from top to bottom in next
year's tournament.

Pep Guardiola once described Tottenham as 'the Harry Kane team', but amid Manchester City's ridiculous reliance on their own superstar striker this season, it has been suggested that his side could be renamed 'the Erling Haaland team'. But after Phil Foden pulled off a miraculous escape act against Leeds United on Saturday, a fairer description might be 'the Haaland AND Foden team'. 

That does not reflect well on the rest of a City squad who seem to no longer have the air of invincibility that used to define them. One reading of Foden's balletic, 91st-minute winner against Leeds that snatched victory after City threw away a two-goal lead in a mostly abject second-half display, was that Guardiola's side showed impressive mental resilience. Another, though, was that they almost threw away two points - if not three - with a complacent performance and had to rely on individual brilliance after a team capitulation.  

City's recent games suggest they are indeed vulnerable and that they are going to struggle to chase down Arsenal in the title race unless they kick a worrying recent habit of surrendering leads.

Guardiola didn't want to read too much into the result nearly 48 hours later when he spoke before Tuesday's trip to Fulham, but he certainly wasn't hailing it as a positive shift in their mentality. 

""It depends on Phil putting the ball in the net,"" he said in a dreary manner suggesting he was still not happy with how his team managed the second half. ""I don't know that one win can define the mentality of the team. I don't believe in these kind of things.""

Foden gave a more lengthy assessment of what happened, outlining what City did right and wrong: ""We were in full control. They changed it around in the second half, changed the system and we couldn't seem to get going. We really struggled, to be honest. It was a frustrating half but when we had a short break, the manager got us together to adapt to their formation and we started playing again.""

The England midfielder, who has six goals and three assists in all competitions this season, also warned his City team-mates that they cannot afford to play like they did in the second half on many more occasions.

""We have to work on things and get things better because when the opponents get better in the later stages of the season, we can't afford to come out like this because we're going to lose the league,"" Foden added. ""We have to put things right and get better and just work hard on the training pitch.”

Saturday marked the sixth time this season where City have surrendered a lead. They conceded twice in the final half-hour at Brighton to turn a 1-0 lead into a 2-1 defeat before letting in a 90th-minute equaliser from Gabriel Martinelli against Arsenal to draw 1-1. They were subsequently dominant in their Champions League outing against Monaco but twice lost their advantage, letting in their second equaliser in the 90th minute, while they conceded an equaliser against Bournemouth, when Gianluigi Donnarumma vented his fury for contact in the area, before eventually securing victory.

They also had poor second halves against both Villarreal and Borussia Dortmund in Europe, even though the scorelines - 2-0 and 4-1, respectively - suggested that they won both games comfortably.

City's struggles to build on the momentum of a good start is becoming more pressing when they are no longer dominating every opponent, as evidenced by their defeats against Tottenham, Aston Villa and Newcastle in which they conceded the first goal.

City went into the game against Leeds on the back of consecutive defeats to Newcastle and Bayer Leverkusen, and Foden admitted that harmed their confidence: ""Obviously, from our own performance, it wasn't good enough from start to finish. But sometimes it's like that when you come off the back of two defeats. For whatever reason, it's so much more difficult to get the three points when you come off the back of defeats.""

""But today wasn't about the way we played or how we performed,"" he continued. ""It was just for us about getting the win because we just wanted to feel how we used to feel with the three points.""

That felt like an admission that something in City's mentality has changed in the last year or so.

Guardiola's side no longer go into every game believing that they are going to win, nor do they seem capable of ensuring they are going to win even when they get off to a good start. Perhaps that should not be surprising given the turnover in the squad, with seven key members of the squad that won the treble in 2023 and secured a record-breaking fourth Premier League title a year later have since left. 

This is not say that City were wrong to move on from those players, several of whom were no longer at their physical peak as they approached their mid-30s, such as Kevin De Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan, Kyle Walker and Ederson. Julian Alvarez, meanwhile, asked to leave so as to play more, while Jack Grealish and Manuel Akanji were struggling with their fitness and form before being loaned out. 

The insatiable winning mentality of the departed players, above all De Bruyne and Gundogan, has, however, proven very difficult to replace.

Ten players have arrived since the summer of 2024, but Donnarumma is the only one to have previously won a European league title. Nico Gonzalez and Tijjani Reijnders, with one domestic cup each from their times in Portugal and Italy, respectively, are the next-most garlanded. 

Of the starting XI against Leeds, only Haaland, Foden, Bernardo Silva and Ruben Dias have lifted more than one league title with City. The absence of Rodri, who is set to miss the trip to Fulham due to an injury layoff which is approaching two months in duration, continues to weigh heavily. 

Guardiola's lack of belief in his second string players could be seen in how he hauled three players off at half-time against Leverkusen after initially making 10 changes to the team that had lost to Newcastle. He admitted it was ""too many"" and he changed them all back against Leeds, apart from Gonzalez and Reijnders.

Guardiola was scathing about the performance of his squad players against Leverkusen, saying they ""didn't try"", but several of his first-choice players, including members of the 2024 title-winning side such as Matheus Nunes and Josko Gvardiol, seemed to switch off against Leeds too.

More evidence that Guardiola is not happy with his squad was provided with reports that City are seriously considering triggering Antoine Semenyo's £65 million ($86m) buy-out clause in January. No one can doubt the quality of the Bournemouth winger, and the fee is very reasonable for the third-most productive player in the league this season behind Haaland and Brentford striker Igor Thiago.

If the deal gets done, then City will have spent £422m ($558m) on new players in the last 13 months. They are seeing, however, that money does not necessarily buy you the insatiable mentality you need to finish top in a title race, particularly against an Arsenal side that has lost just one game in all competitions this season. Semenyo would make City a more formidable force going forward and ease the burden on Haaland and Foden, but it will take something else to take City's mindset to the next level.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Neymar knee issue & World Cup fears explained","https://www.goal.com/en/news/neymar-meniscus-knee-injury-recovery-issue-world-cup-fears-explained/blt412b83183d9c0e0c","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 11:48:35 GMT","

The Selecao's all-time leading goalscorer is in for another lengthy spell on the sidelines.


Brazilian football has been rocked to its core once again, as Neymar's future has taken another dramatic downturn at the very moment he desperately needed some stability. Persistent fitness setbacks have stopped him from finding any rhythm since returning to Santos, and on the international front, he hasn't pulled on the Brazil shirt since October 2023 when an ACL injury derailed his momentum.

His emotional return to Brazil has not gone the way he or the fans imagined, as injuries keep derailing the comeback story for the former Barcelona superstar. The latest setback, a meniscus problem, was meant to sideline him for the rest of the year.

But with Santos sitting 17th and staring relegation in the face with only three games left, the 33-year-old threw medical advice out the window. He chose to play through the pain, fully aware that he was gambling with his future. The risk paid off on the night. Neymar scored and created another in a 3–0 victory that lifted Santos out of the drop zone, at least temporarily.

Reports in Brazil later suggested that the injury was even worse than first feared, with a tear in the meniscus of his left knee. The recommended solution was arthroscopic surgery, but the operation would have ruled him out for roughly a month and brought his season to an early end. Rather than undergo treatment and strengthen his case for a World Cup call-up, Neymar opted to keep training and competing for Santos, putting even more strain on an already delicate knee.

But what is a meniscus injury & how long does recovery take? As GOAL finds out...

A torn meniscus happens when the strong cartilage inside the knee gives way. Wedged between the femur and tibia are two pads of cartilage known as the meniscus, and they act like shock absorbers, softening the impact every time the knee bends or turns. A sharp twist, sudden pivot, or awkward rotation can be all it takes to rip that cartilage.

As the years go by, that cushioning naturally wears down and loses strength, making it much more vulnerable to damage. Arthritis, which gradually breaks down cartilage in the joints, can also set the stage for a tear. It's no surprise that this is one of the most frequent injuries seen in sports, especially among athletes who push their knees through constant cutting, sprinting and turning. Athletes in sports that demand sharp twists and quick changes of direction, think tennis, football, basketball or soccer, sit right at the top of the risk chart for a meniscus tear. 

The danger only jumps higher in full-contact games, where a heavy collision or tackle can force the knee into an awkward turn and shred the cartilage. And just to be clear, it's not only the high-intensity players who suffer. Over time, the meniscus can simply wear down from years of use, which means anyone can pick up a degenerative tear regardless of how active they are.

Walking/playing on a torn meniscus is technically possible at first, since many people can still stand and apply weight right after the injury. But that window closes fast. Within a day or two the knee typically swells up like a balloon, the pain spikes, and suddenly even a simple step feels like a battle.

Even banged up, Neymar is still dragging Santos forward almost single-handedly. Playing through pain in his left knee, the Brazilian icon turned in a match-winning display in Friday's vital 3-0 win over Sport Recife, a result that hauled the club out of the relegation zone, at least for the moment. With two matches left to be played in the Brazilian Serie A, Santos is still fighting for survival.

Recovery from a torn meniscus isn't the same for everyone. The timeline really depends on how serious the tear is and how quickly the body responds to rehab. For those who undergo surgery, the road back typically ranges from about three to eight weeks of focused recovery work.

There's always the urge to jump straight back into running, jumping, and all the old habits, but rushing the process is a recipe for another setback. Before anyone even thinks about returning to full-speed training or competition, a few boxes need to be checked:

For most people, getting back to 100 percent can take anywhere from six weeks to a few months. By the four-month mark after surgery, many are back to living normally and easing into more demanding activities, including sports. But timelines aren't universal. Those returning to high-impact competitions like basketball or soccer often need more time to ensure the knee can handle the intensity.

Since taking the reins of the Brazilian national team, Carlo Ancelotti has yet to summon Neymar, and the omission has split opinions across the football world. Ancelotti has stood firm on his stance, stressing that his squad must be built around players who are healthy, in rhythm, and competing week in and week out.

This latest injury twist only muddies the waters further. The debate is no longer simply about whether Neymar can get back to full fitness in time. The real dilemma now is whether Ancelotti will be willing to gamble on a star who hasn't enjoyed a steady run of games in months and whose injury history seems to grow longer every season.

He stressed that the issue has never been about Neymar's ability, making it clear in his recent interview: ""I think he has great talent. He was unlucky to get injured during the time we were together. He couldn't prepare himself to be in good physical shape because of the injuries. We are in November..."" The coach then doubled down on his respect for the forward, adding, ""Neymar is on the same level as the others, considering that Neymar has already shown extraordinary talent.""

The 2026 World Cup is set to kick off on Thursday, June 11, 2026, signaling the tournament's long-awaited return to its classic June-July window. The showpiece will run through the summer before wrapping up with the final on July 19.

It's a contrast to the 2022 World Cup, which broke tradition by shifting to the northern hemisphere's winter. That switch was made to dodge the extreme summer heat in Qatar, where scorching June and July temperatures were deemed too dangerous for both players and fans.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Cat Macario shined, Jaedyn Shaw delivered a statement, and Emma Hayes couldn't stop smiling as the USWNT capped 2025 with another dominant win over Italy.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - It was impossible to miss the smile on Emma Hayes' face. Every time the camera panned to the U.S. women's national team coach, she was either grinning or laughing. And she had every reason to - her team delivered the kind of performance you want to close out a 2025 slate.

Facing Italy again just days after a 3-0 win, the U.S. took care of business in much the same way. This one finished 2-0 instead of three, but the performance was just as convincing. To close out 2025, the U.S. put in one more shift - and it was the familiar faces who carried them, just as they have all year.

Cat Macario scored the first, finishing with a fantastic chip that only an in-form player can provide. Lily Yohannes assisted her, continuing her evolution at just 18. Then, for the second, Alyssa Thompson teed up Jaedyn Shaw, who did the heavy-lifting with a long-range curler that left the goalkeeper with nothing to do but aimlessly dive and wave at the ball as it soared past her. Shaw reflected on just how important it was for her to wrap up 2025 with a goal. 

""Looking back on the year, I think it has been so much of a roller coaster of emotions,"" she told GOAL. ""I think it didn't start out how I thought it would be. I think  just like trusting in my faith and trusting in God's plan for me, that like it's all gonna work out for the betterment of seeing what like my next opportunity is, and it's all preparation for moments like these."" 

Macario and Shaw's goals were the biggest causes of Hayes' happiness. But there were plenty of other reasons, too. This was a complete performance from a complete team, one that will now head into 2026 with plenty of optimism as World Cup qualifying starts next year. Hayes jokingly compared her team's progress and potential outlook for next year to a superb winter stew that isn't quite finished yet. 

""I think, first of all, it's still cooking, and it's a little bit if I think about it, like being a nice winter dish...Like a slow-cooked stew, and [it] gets better with more time it's on. The heat certainly gets more tender. I think when I watch our team play, I think you're starting to see the maturity in the performances,"" she said. 

GOAL breaks down the winners and losers from Chase Stadium...

Celia Balf contributed reporting from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 

This 2025 calendar year tested  Shaw. There was a while there where she was seemingly staring down a crossroads. Well, whatever path she took at that crossroads was the right one because, right now, there's no doubt that Shaw is blossoming into the best version of herself. She pointed to winning a title with Gotham FC and jokingly remembered that she's still just 21 while reflecting on overcoming challenges. 

""Just being here now, being able to reflect on those times is so special for me, and ending the year on like, such a high, like winning a championship… It still feels weird. But yeah, I'm, I'm so happy to be at this point and my career, and I'm so blessed to be around these amazing people to help me in these times,"" she said. 

With her goal on Monday, the Gotham FC starlet snapped her 13-game goalless run, finally getting that big USWNT payoff that she deserved. It took a while to get there, as Shaw battled back from a tough run of form to start the season, one that saw her spend time with the U-23s in an attempt to rebuild. Consider her rebuilt now, though, and perhaps better than ever.

Shaw will, quite obviously, be riding high. Fresh off a NWSL title with Gotham FC, she carried that momentum right into this game. As she heads into the offseason, the forward admitted she picked an ironic spot for a vacation. 

""I will be going on vacation. I'm going to Italy, actually, which is ironic. It is ironic, but yeah, so I'm getting girls from Italy…So yeah, I'll definitely be getting some rest and recovery,"" she said. 

Once she's back from the Bel Paese, the USWNT will hope she carries her momentum into 2026 now because, if she can, the sky really does seem to be the limit for a player who, just a few short months ago, faced a fight to prove that was true.

Durante will be sore tomorrow. This was not a fun game with her, and not just because of the goals she conceded.

The goals, of course, were pretty unsavable, but that won't make her feel any better. Macario's chip was stunning, but hey, it happens. Shaw's finish, meanwhile, was pretty unsavable and, again, it happens. In terms of pure goalkeeping, there was little Durante could do, so no real reason to feel bad there.

She will feel bad physically, though. Durante got hit hard multiple times on USWNT set pieces, forcing stoppages multiple times. The Italy goalkeeper surely got the wind knocked out of her at least one of those times. She didn't leave the game with an injury, but her back will surely feel that in the morning.

There was a split second where one could see the wheels turning in Macario's head. She looked up, then down, then up again, and then came to her conclusion: ""Yeah, I'm gonna chip her."" The chip was perfect, and the ball went into the back of the net. 

That's what Macario can do.

In particular, though, that's what she's capable of when she's in form. With her first-half goal, she now has five finishes in her last three USWNT appearances, taking her total to eight in the 2025 calendar year. That leads the team, and it's no surprise: Macario has been leading this team all year long. This goal was among her best, but again, these types of moments have become commonplace for the Chelsea star. Yohannes, who threaded the needle in delivering the ball to the striker, believes the pair is starting to form strong chemistry on the pitch. 

""Cat is just such a special player, and I know if she gets the ball in front of the goal, 10 times out of 10, it is probably going to be a goal,"" Yohannes said. ""So, yeah, I'm just, I think we're growing a partnership. I think that's super cool. You know, we have a great friendship off the pitch and to be on the pitch and assisting her...I'm just so proud of her.""

For several years, injuries robbed the USWNT of that. For so long, this team played without her and, in truth, they thrived. Now, with Macario back and in this type of form, the USWNT has something special going, largely because she is a special, special player. 

Scoreline-wise? Yeah, this was a little better. Two-nil is better than 3-0, so they have that going for them. Performance-wise, though? Italy didn't offer much, and they never really threatened the USWNT across the two matches in December. 

This Italy team isn't bad. They entered this window ranked 12th in the world, with the USWNT ranked second. In these games, though, there was a clear gap. On Monday, the U.S. had 66 percent of the ball and fired seven shots to Italy's one. One team was significantly better than the other here, no matter what the rankings say.

With the loss, Italy now sit on a five-game winless run. They lost to England in extra time in the Euro semifinals before drawing Japan and then falling to Brazil in October friendlies. These two defeats to the U.S. were the final pieces of that streak. There's no shame in those results, but for a team that seems so close, turning those losses into signature wins is what will push this program forward.



Hayes has never been concerned about age. This match was the fourth time this year that she'd started three teenagers. This time, the trio was Yohannes, Jordyn Bugg, and Claire Hutton, and all three showed well.

Starting with Yohannes, who was, as always, one of the best players on the field. Her assist on the first goal was magnificent. Her dummies were breathtaking. Every time she was on the ball, magic happened. That's nothing unusual for the 18-year-old midfielder these days. Hayes mentioned she's encouraged by Yohannes' showing, but stressed there are still areas for development. 

""You can't put a ceiling on anyone. So we won't do that. But she's 18, and all of the things that she has, the super strengths for her, we want to keep developing them, but at the same time, we've got to upskill her in the things that going to be required for the top level,"" Hayes explained. 

Hayes mentioned she played the teenager further up the pitch because of the fact that she still needs to grow defensively. 

""I still think there's room to grow in that and but she's a willing student...What will keep accelerating her learning, is her commitment to the growth of the areas that she needs to add to be a truly world class player,"" she said. ""Right now, she's a world-class prospect, and that there is a distinction, because that bar is really, really high.""

Hutton and Bugg were good, too. With Yohannes playing higher up, Hutton did well as Lindsey Horan's midfield partner. Bugg, meanwhile, was rarely tested in defense but, in the few moments she was, acquitted herself well. None of the three looked like teenagers, and that's the biggest compliment you can give them.

Hayes will continue to trust them, and she should, as these young stars continue to earn their trust.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Chloe Kelly: How England's Euros hero found herself back on the Arsenal bench and down the Lionesses pecking order","https://www.goal.com/en-om/lists/chloe-kelly-england-euros-hero-arsenal-bench-down-lionesses-pecking-order/bltac49f717024de5fb","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

It's hard to overstate the degree to which Chloe Kelly captured the attention of a nation this past summer. Her pivotal performances in the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final of the 2025 European Championship helped drive England on to a second successive continental crown while also catapulting her name into the limelight like never before, even surpassing the levels achieved after her extra-time goal won Euro 2022. Yet, fans tuning into the Women's Super League this season hoping to see Kelly's magic in action for Arsenal, will have been disappointed.

With nine WSL games and four Champions League outings on the board, only four players in the Gunners' squad have accrued fewer minutes across all competitions than Kelly, who has started just three times since the season kicked-off in early September. Given she not only shone for England in the summer, but also made her move to Arsenal permanent off the back of an exciting loan spell in the first half of 2025, it's certainly not been what most expected.

In just a few weeks, Kelly will head to the ceremony for the prestigious BBC Sports Personality of the Year award as the second-favourite to win, only marginally behind golfer Rory McIlroy, who completed the career grand slam earlier this year by triumphing at the Masters in dramatic fashion. But as her impact at Euro 2025 continues to be celebrated, can Kelly find the magic needed to spark her season into life?

It's been a weird start to this season for Kelly. The 27-year-old started Arsenal's first game of the season, against London City Lionesses, missed the next outing at West Ham due to a knock and would sport visible strapping on her right knee from there on out, up until early November, as she clearly nursed some sort of issue.

Yet, the West Ham game would be the only one she'd miss, with a start against European giants Lyon even coming in early October despite Kelly not looking fully fit at times. Indeed, in that clash with the French champions, the England winger struggled massively to get involved in attack and didn't help out enough in defence before being withdrawn before the hour. Until Arsenal's final game before this international break, the rest of her appearances for the club so far this term have come as a substitute.

While it's easy to say that Renee Slegers, the Arsenal boss, could've maybe just coped without Kelly for a few weeks while she got over the issue plaguing her, the player is always going to want to play, especially given the increased competition for places in the Gunners' wide areas this season following Olivia Smith's record-breaking arrival from Liverpool.

Plus, despite not being at 100 per cent, Kelly has still provided some special moments. She was on the scoresheet against former club Manchester City in early October, albeit in an eventual 3-2 defeat, and has reminded everyone of the wonderful service she can provide in the Champions League. Her quick-thinking assist for Alessia Russo in the win over Benfica was brilliant while it was her wicked cross that the England No.9 tucked away to level the scores on Arsenal's way to victory over Real Madrid just recently.

Fortunately, that period of managing an injury seems to be behind Kelly now. Asked about the winger when she was called up by England for this ongoing camp, Slegers clarified the situation with regards to her fitness. ""She missed the West Ham game and a couple of training sessions but since then she's been building back, and some things take a little bit longer than others, but she's fully fit,"" she explained.

That was underlined by Slegers' team selection just before the international break, as she handed Kelly just her third start of the season against Real Madrid. The winger justified her inclusion in the XI, too. After having a significant impact in the clash with Las Blancas in last year's Champions League quarter-final, playing a key role in the Gunners' historic comeback win, Kelly was effective again in this rematch, delivering that great cross for Russo to head home and get the European champions back into things.

It was the highlight of a performance in which Kelly, free of that strapping on her knee, generally looked back to full fitness and sharpness, too, standing out as one of Arsenal's best players on the night.

It feels like Kelly's season can really start now then. After all, we're talking about a player who lit up Euro 2025 despite not starting any of England's six games, sparking the Lionesses' into life right when they needed it. It was Kelly's brilliant delivery that allowed Lucy Bronze to get England back into a quarter-final they seemed well out of, it was her goal that defeated Italy in the next round and sent the Lionesses through to the final, and it was her spot-kick that defeated Spain to win the trophy. She didn't do it all alone, of course, but she played a massive role.

That quality was on show for Arsenal in the second half of last season, too. Having secured a loan move to north London, freeing her from a situation at Manchester City where she was totally out of favour, Kelly starred as the Gunners enjoyed much-improved form under Slegers and won the Champions League. There's no doubting her status as one of the best wingers in England, and Europe, when she is fit and firing. Now that she is getting back to the latter, she can show that.

England's win over China on Saturday, by a record-breaking 8-0 scoreline, felt like a timely reminder of the need for Kelly to deliver, too, as the Lionesses enter a new cycle that features the 2027 Women's World Cup. As Beth Mead lit up Wembley Stadium with a quickfire brace, Lauren Hemp scored on her return from injury and Jess Park entered the game as a lively winger, following a positional change at Manchester United, the Lionesses' competition for places in the wide areas was underlined. This was also all without Lauren James, who made her first appearance of the season for Chelsea last month after overcoming a foot problem.

Kelly has similar competition at Arsenal as well, where she can count Mead, Smith and Australia forward Caitlin Foord as team-mates, as well as the versatile Mariona Caldentey. In order to get minutes for club and country, and assert herself as a key player for both, Kelly has to show that ability which has made her so talismanic so regularly. If not, there are others that can.

Having seemingly overcome the issue that hampered her in the first few months of the season, Kelly should get those opportunities to remind everyone what she can do in the latter stages of this year. Between the WSL, Champions League and the knockout stages of the League Cup beginning, Arsenal have plenty of games before the winter break, and Kelly's return to full sharpness could be exactly what they need to get out of the funk they find themselves in, having won just one of their last four games.

Sarina Wiegman, meanwhile, may look at Tuesday's clash with Ghana as a chance to help reignite the player who was so crucial to success at Euro 2025. World Cup qualifying will begin in the New Year and the Lionesses have a tough assignment, needing to pip Spain to top spot in their group to secure automatic qualification for the tournament in Brazil.

Achieving as much will be made easier if England can turn to an in-form Kelly, a player who has delivered game-changing and title-winning moments aplenty in her career to date. But to get to that point, she needs to start racking up the game time again. She'll hope that starts on Tuesday and only continues through to the end of a 2025 which has been monumental and, with the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award to be dished out just before Christmas, could well get even better yet.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Check out our soccer expert's Fulham vs Man City predictions, prior to Tuesday's 2:30pm ET Premier League clash (12/02).

Our betting expert expects a dominant City victory, even though the Cottagers have home advantage.

Even though they achieved some positive results recently, Manchester City haven't won away from home in the Premier League since early October. Pep Guardiola will view the match against Fulham as a significant opportunity to change that.

Regarding injuries, only Mateo Kovacic and Rodri will be sidelined, so there are no new concerns. Meanwhile, their opponents are missing Antonee Robinson and Rodrigo Muniz. Both teams will be very close to what they'd consider full strength.

However, Cityzens have the advantage on paper, as they are the strongest side. Additionally, they have won 18 consecutive games against the Cottagers since 2012. They haven't lost against them since 2009.

Neither side can be considered defensively secure. Fulham kept excellent clean sheets against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Sunderland recently. However, those are two of only five clean sheets they have achieved across all competitions. They also conceded a goal in their victory over Spurs.

Meanwhile, City have only managed to keep one clean sheet in their last eight fixtures, although they won five of them. Even Leeds United, one of the lowest-scoring teams in the division, managed to score two goals at the Etihad over the weekend. Silva will view this game as an opportunity to cause problems.

Historically, this fixture has featured several goals, as well. Over 2.5 goals have been scored in their 10 most recent meetings, and both teams have found the net in five of the last seven. Therefore, there may be value in the goals market in this match.

Phil Foden has started to show signs of improvement after a difficult spell. The England international scored a couple of goals against Borussia Dortmund recently and seemed ready to net in the Premier League. On Saturday, he scored his first league goal since September, and then went on to score the winning goal.

City have plenty of goalscorers and creators, with five players getting goals/assists against Leeds, but Foden's confidence will be high. The 25-year-old has a few G/A against Fulham in the past, so he will be confident in this match. As usual, there's not much value in Erling Haaland to score, so other options should be considered.

Foden is at value to score once again as he steadily approaches a record of 200 direct contributions for his boyhood club.

Fulham have been in great form recently, and will go into this game after an impressive away win against Tottenham Hotspur over the weekend. Marco Silva's men have won three of their last four Premier League games and reached 15th place. Confidence will be high for the Cottagers, especially at Craven Cottage.

Meanwhile, Manchester City bounced back as they scored late to secure victory over Leeds United over the weekend. Defeats to Newcastle United and Bayer Leverkusen weren't helpful, but beating Leeds placed them five points behind Arsenal. Pep Guardiola will be eager to see his side keep their momentum going this Tuesday.

Fulham expected lineup: Leno, Tete, Andersen, Bassey, Sessegnon, Iwobi, Berge, Wilson, King, Chukwueze, Jimenez

Man City expected lineup: Donnarumma; Nunes, Gvardiol, Dias, O'Reilly; Silva, Gonzalez, Cherki; Doku, Haaland, Foden","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Roma giving up on Joshua Zirkzee?! Serie A giants eye Mathys Tel swoop as potential alternative to Man Utd forward","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/roma-giving-up-joshua-zirkzee-serie-a-giants-eye-mathys-tel-swoop-alternative-to-man-utd-forward/bltd1f711b4b3328f5b","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 15:13:04 GMT","

Serie A giants Roma are reportedly eyeing a swoop for Tottenham forward Mathys Tel, who is seen as a potential alternative to Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee. What once looked like a straightforward January approach for Zirkzee has been thrown in to doubt by his stellar display for United at Crystal Palace over the weekend, and the fact Ruben Amorim could be short on attacking options over the next two months.

Zirkzee had endured an excruciating goal drought of nearly eight months, but he finally found the net in United's Premier League win over Palace on Sunday afternoon. His strike was a well-taken equaliser, and it was not only his first since April, when he scored against Lyon in the Europa League, but also his first in England's top flight in close to a year. It was a moment that not only eased personal pressure but also revived questions about his immediate future.

Speaking to TNT Sport after the match, the 23-year-old could barely hide his relief. 

""A great feeling, you know, it's always a good feeling to score but most importantly it got us back into the game."" he said. ""It was all about the three points today, just very happy that we got them, very important. When asked about the pressure of going without a goal while playing for United he said: “It's one of the biggest clubs in the world and you have to perform, so if you don't score for a long time then it can get to you. But I'm surrounded by great players, great people and we help each other every day and they made it quite easy for me. Today is just a reward I think for patience, hard work and trying to be consistent and I'm just thankful to the manager as well, staff, everyone. A good environment.""

Il Messaggero report that the Italian club have been in dialogue with the striker's representatives for weeks. Manager Gian Piero Gasperini has categorised Zirkzee as his priority target, and sporting director Frederic Massara has been pushing to arrange an initial loan agreement. However, Zirkzee's post-match declaration of happiness at United has reportedly unsettled the Serie A club. While his desire for minutes remains known, his public tone of contentment is viewed as a potential obstacle, raising doubts about whether he would push for a mid-season departure. Amorim is also relying on Zirkzee to lead the line while summer signing Benjamin Sesko is out injured, with United's frontline set to be depleted further when Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo head to the AFCON.

With the Zirkzee plan suddenly at risk, Roma are widening their search and Tel has quickly risen to the top of the list. The Tottenham forward has faced his own struggles for game time, offering an opportunity the Giallorossi believe they can exploit. Tel's last Premier League start dates back to October. Although he scored in a 2-2 draw against United, he has since been restricted largely to late substitute appearances, including in Spurs' latest clash with Fulham. Roma see this stagnation as a window to tempt him with a more significant role in Italy.

As January draws closer, Roma must now make a firm decision. Whether they return for Zirkzee with renewed conviction or pivot fully toward Tel may define the direction of their winter window.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","The Fierce Feuds lighting up the latest #NextGenATP wave","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/next-in-line-fierce-feuds-december-2025","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 07:48:38 GMT","

 They may be relatively fresh to life on the tennis circuit, but the 2025 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF competitors have wasted little time in striking up Fierce Feuds with their on-court rivals. 

 Nicolai Budkov Kjaer will be finely tuned to performing on the big stage when he steps on court for his Jeddah debut later this month. The 19-year-old Norwegian finished his regular season by playing ATP Tour events in Stockholm, Vienna (his ATP 500 debut) and Metz, and he opened up to ATPTour.com about some of the deep-rooted relationships that already exist between some of the brightest young stars in men's tennis. 

 “Joel Schwaerzler and I travelled to a J500 in Osaka our first ITF junior year,” recalled Budkov Kjaer to ATPTour.com. “We practised a lot together that week and I won the training sets, I remember, but then he beat me 7-6, 7-5 in the final. The year after we won the doubles at Roland Garros together and I feel we both have had a rivalry and friendship in one. 

 “These days I have a lot of fun with Alexander Blockx, we go to many of the same Challengers. But I was quite far behind all the other Next Gen's when I was young. Only from the age of 15 did I improve fast and from 16 I started to play the same tournaments as all these other players.”

 Even if he ends up only facing opponents with whom he is less familiar than Blockx in Jeddah, Budkov Kjaer is aware of the level he will have to hit if he wants to make an impact at King Abdullah Sports City. 

 “I think they are all really talented, everyone with their own extraordinary skill set,” said the Norwegian, when asked about the other Jeddah contenders. “History has shown that the Next Gen finals participants can impact tennis the next decade. Some of the players I already know a bit, the others I look forward to meeting for the first time and get to know better - on and off court.” 

Another player very familiar with Blockx is his fellow 20-year-old Belgian Gilles Arnaud Bailly. Bailly believes that friendly rivalries with Blockx and other rivals his age have the potential to act as crucial motivators in his career. 

 “I have a really good relationship with Blockx. We talk a lot and we get on so well,” said Bailly, who hit a career-high No. 201 in the PIF ATP Rankings on 10 November. “Because I am climbing now, I hope we can play more tournaments together. We have a lot of contact together and we play some games on the phone together, so there is a competitive edge there. 

 “I get on really well with him and I hope to see him and the others more often on Tour and the relationships will develop. I have known Blockx for many years and we keep pushing each other and it is healthy to have that relationship.” 



 Bailly earned his maiden tour-level win on home soil in October by defeating World No. 51 Daniel Altmaier in Brussels after using a Next Gen entry spot to enter qualifying at the indoor ATP 250. He spoke of how important he thinks competing at the top level is for the development of #NextGenATP stars. 

 “I think the Next Gen entry spots we get given are great,” said Bailly, referring to the Next Gen Accelerator pathway, which offers 20-and-under players ranked in the Top 250 eligibility for one ATP 250 main draw spot and two ATP 250 qualifying event opportunities each season. “The other Next Gen guys are doing so well. 

 “Blockx, Landaluce, Budkov Kjaer are all doing really well on the ATP Tour and Challenger Tour. It is great from the ATP to give us chances, otherwise it would be tough to play some events, so that support is helpful. I like seeing the other young players do well, it gives you further drive.” 

 Watch Highlights Of Bailly's Breakthrough ATP Tour Win:

 One player that can attest to Bailly's theory is Nishesh Basavareddy. Having made his Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in 2024 alongside a familiar face from his junior days, Learner Tien, Basavareddy then faced his friend and rival for the first time at Tour-level on one of the biggest stages of them all: in the first round at Wimbledon in July. 

 ""The first time I met Learner was when I was six,” Basavareddy told ATPTour.com. ""We played at the Little Mo Regionals in San Diego, and I remember those matches being real battles. I also played Alex [Michelsen] when I was seven and he was already a year older than me. We crossed paths at junior tournaments all the time, and over the years, we've not only competed but become close friends.”

 Basavareddy and Tien did not play each other in Jeddah a year ago, when the latter went on to reach the championship match. With Tien having triumphed in straight sets in their Wimbledon clash and both players now having qualified once again for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, the 20-year-old Basavareddy will be seeking a revenge win. 

 “I think our games match up pretty well,” Basavareddy told ATPTour.com when asked about Tien ahead of their Wimbledon clash. “We are both not the biggest servers, but we have a lot of baseline rallies. The [two Challenger] matches [we played in 2024] were quite long, especially the first one in a final. He's a counterpuncher, he makes a lot of balls, and he's really smart out there, so he makes it tough on you.”

In the men's tennis hierarchy, Shelton ended 2025 smack dab in the middle of two tiers: clearly above most of the field, but still hitting the Carlos Alcaraz-Jannik Sinner ceiling. The American's in-between status presents him with the dual challenge of not only looking to upset an increasingly cemented duopoly, but also doing all he can to remain in front of the so-called second line.Essential to that mission will be staying healthy. Shelton came to Flushing Meadows this summer looking like a title contender, but his US Open campaign was cut short by a sudden shoulder injury. Though he returned to action in time to clinch a maiden ATP Finals berth, he went 0-3 in round-robin play, and dropped from No. 5 to No. 9 after one disappointing week.In addition to regaining his fighting shape, there's still the mental hurdle of Sincaraz, who lead Shelton by a combined 11-1 in head-to-head matches.“If you want to win a big title these days, that's who you've got to go through,” conceded Shelton at the US Open.“I think that, you know, for me, I get too far ahead of myself, and next thing you know you trip over your own feet and you don't even give yourself a chance to get started,” he added, aiming to focus more on creating opportunities to play big matches instead of fixating on specific opponents.Any big match involving Shelton is guaranteed to generate headlines, but 2026 could be the year he becomes the headliner.—David Kane

This week, Steve Tignor will reveal his ATP Matches of the Year, and the TENNIS.com editors will reveal our ATP Players of the Year. The WTA editions will begin Monday, December 8.Carlos Alcaraz and Arthur Fils had played two fiercely fought sets, filled with blazing winners and lunging retrievals. Now Fils had reached the moment of truth, and he had the shot he wanted. One more clean forehand swing and he would serve for the match against the four-time Slam champ.It was the Monte Carlo quarterfinals. More important, it was the first meeting between the Spaniard and the Frenchman, who were 21 and 20, respectively, at the time.

Full-swing forehands from one side were met by even bigger cuts from the other. Slugfest rallies at the baseline evolved into cat-and-mouse duels at the net.

Carlos Alcaraz and Arthur Fils had played two fiercely fought sets, filled with blazing winners and lunging retrievals. Now Fils had reached the moment of truth, and he had the shot he wanted. One more clean forehand swing and he would serve for the match against the four-time Slam champ.It was the Monte Carlo quarterfinals. More important, it was the first meeting between the Spaniard and the Frenchman, who were 21 and 20, respectively, at the time.

He was eagerly awaiting whatever Alcaraz had in store, and looked, for a set and a half, like the better player. When push came to shove, it was Fils' reflexed returns and heavy forehands that prevailed. Alcaraz's customary grin was nowhere to be found. He looked stressed, by Fils and the French-centric crowd.Serving at 5-5 in the second set, Alcaraz seemed to buckle under Fils' pressure, going down 0-40. Two good points got him back to 30-40. With one more break chance, Fils slowly took control of a rally, running around to hit forehands and forcing Alcaraz to come up with short-hop backhands. Finally, Fils had a look at an inside-out forehand. He fired it toward the sideline; for a split-second, it looked like a winner. Then the electronic voice spoke: “Out.” Alcaraz had reached deuce. Breathing a sigh of relief, he held, then played a much more upbeat game to break for the set, finishing with a perfectly measured lob winner. He was grinning again.

Instead of caving, Fils quickly rebuilt a 3-1 lead in the third. But that only inspired Alcaraz to find another gear. Fils opened the door with an error-filled game at 3-2, and Alcaraz barreled through it. At 3-3, his backhand began to click. At 3-4, Fils tried to counter by going even bigger with his forehand, but sent the ball into the net and the doubles alley instead. Fils was broken for 5-3. A second or two later, his racquet was, too.“I just wanted to stay strong and wait for my chances,” Alcaraz said after his 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 win. “He puts a lot of pressure on his opponents.

Matches like this give me more confidence to keep doing it.”It was all the confidence he needed for the rest of the year, it turned out.

Looking back at Alcaraz's 2025, this win stands out as a turning point. He was coming off an opening-round loss in Miami to David Goffin, a defeat so traumatizing it left him telling reporters, “Mentally, I'm screwed.” After switching surfaces and fending off Fils, Alcaraz won Monte Carlo, Rome, and Roland Garros in quick succession.Fils, unfortunately, went in the other direction.

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Bearman furious after botched Haas pit stop

Red Bull have stated that comments made about Kimi Antonelli in Qatar were ""clearly incorrect"", after the Mercedes rookie faced abuse online.

Red Bull have said they ""sincerely regret"" the online abuse directed towards Kimi Antonelli following ""clearly incorrect"" comments suggesting the Mercedes rookie allowed title contender Lando Norris past in the Qatar Grand Prix.

With Max Verstappen on course to win at the Lusail International Circuit, Antonelli found himself running ahead of Norris in the closing stages of the race, thanks to a tyre strategy that had seen Mercedes pit both cars under the early Safety Car. That had gained Antonelli track position on Norris, who had slightly fresher hard tyres in the final stint.

Norris had closed to within DRS range of Antonelli, who was putting in a defensive masterclass to keep the McLaren at bay whilst also trying to catch up to Carlos Sainz ahead to fight for the final podium position. But with just two laps to go, Antonelli ran deep into a corner and that gave Norris the opportunity he needed to grab P4 and two extra vital points as he looks to secure his maiden title in Abu Dhabi next weekend.

Gianpiero Lambiase, Verstappen's race engineer, told the reigning champion over the radio: “Not sure what happened to Antonelli Max, looks like he just pulled over and let Norris through.” However, Lambiase was quick to apologise to Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff for the comment, conceding he had not seen the situation fully.

On Monday Red Bull released a statement that read: “Comments made before the end of, and immediately after, the Qatar GP suggesting that Mercedes driver Kimi Antonelli had deliberately allowed Lando Norris to overtake him are clearly incorrect.

""Replay footage shows Antonelli momentarily losing control of his car, thus allowing Norris to pass him. We sincerely regret that this has led to Antonelli receiving online abuse.”

Following the conclusion of the Qatar Grand Prix, which saw the title battle move on to the finale in Abu Dhabi, Wolff was asked in his post-race media session about the remarks made about Antonelli, describing the notion he would move aside as ""nonsense"".

“We are fighting for P2 in the championship, which is important for us,"" Wolff explained. ""Kimi is fighting for a potential P3 [in the race].

“It annoys me, because I'm annoyed with the race itself, how it went. I'm annoyed with the mistake at the end. I'm annoyed with other mistakes and then hearing such nonsense blows my mind.

“The other thing is that, beyond losing the points for the Constructors' Championship, I spoke to GP [Lambiase]. I saw him and obviously he was emotional in that moment because they [McLaren] needed a P3, I guess, to win the championship or P4, I don't know, but one position… And I said to him, he [Antonelli] just went off.

“[Antonelli] had a bit of a moment in the previous corner and then less entry speed into that left-hander, put the gas down and at that moment, which can happen, that lost the position. So with GP, everything is clear. He said he didn't see the situation.”

As for the race itself, Wolff seemed frustrated that his drivers could not show the full potential of the car. Russell had dropped places at the start, while Antonelli lost out to Sainz – and also on a potential podium – in the first round of pit stops.

“We had a fast car in the Sprint, and I think we had a fast car today,"" Wolff added. ""When you lose positions on the pit stop and you make mistakes in the race, obviously that's not going to help. I think if you start in free air, you fight in the front.""

Mercedes are 33 points ahead of Red Bull in the championship, as they look to secure P2 behind McLaren. And while that is some consolation from the final season of the current regulations, Wolff admitted it was a far cry from what he and the team expected of themselves.

“I think when we look at the statistics in 20 years, you can say there was a P2 in 2013, then there were eight consecutive World Championships, and then there was a P2, P3, P4, P2.

“I think it's not humiliating. You look at the stats, and you say, well, that's a team that has fought on the front. If we are being totally honest with ourselves, then you need to say that there wasn't a single year [of the regulations] we were really fighting for a World Championship.

“That is the crux of the matter. I think McLaren has doubled the points than us, almost, and in the previous years it was Max that ruled the world. No one in the team thinks that that's good enough.”

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Bearman furious after botched Haas pit stop

Red Bull Team Principal Laurent Mekies reflects on the Qatar Grand Prix.

Laurent Mekies was swift to pay tribute to both Red Bull and Max Verstappen in the wake of the Dutchman's victory in the Qatar Grand Prix, which was achieved despite the RB21 not being a match for the McLaren on pace across the weekend as a whole.

Verstappen's win was teed up by the decision to pit under the early Lap 7 Safety Car, with the Dutchman the first to pull into the pit lane, with both McLaren cars staying out. That enabled Verstappen to jump ahead of his rivals once Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris did pit, and he held on to win the race by a comfortable margin.

His victory also ensured he leapfrogged Piastri into second in the Drivers' Championship and is now just 12 points behind Norris, meaning there will be a three-way fight for the title next weekend in the final race of the season.

“We can definitely be happy with that one,"" Mekies said after the race. ""The pace in the car steadily improved from Friday night when we were in a tricky position, to tonight when we could fight with the McLarens, which is a testament to the team once again.

“Of course, the decisive moment was the call to come in under the Safety Car and it was another great call from our strategy team here and those working back in Milton Keynes. From there on, Max didn't put a foot wrong, drove two incredible stints, taking great care of his tyres and managed to create a solid gap to the McLarens, which drove us to this most welcome race win.”

Mekies admitted he and his team were “surprised” that McLaren did not pit at least one car under the Safety Car. With the Qatar race being 57 laps long and the tyres only allowed to complete a maximum of 25 laps thanks to a mandate from Pirelli, the Safety Car coming out when it did enabled most of the field to file in for a ‘cheap' pit stop.

“We were very surprised because on our side we had sort of pre-decided that that would be the first lap we can take it and [that] we would take it,"" he added. ""But I cannot judge for what was their thought process at that moment. But yes, we were very surprised, yes.""

But what made Mekies the happiest was the fact that Red Bull turned a difficult car that was off the pace of the McLaren into one that was competitive for the Grand Prix. That was no mean feat considering that Qatar's track layout played to all their rival's strengths.

“We are behind from Friday by a large amount, four or five tenths, which was painful,"" Mekies explained. ""Then everyone has done an amazing job back at base and here at the racetrack to continue to try to put the car in different windows to see if we could close that gap. We were expecting McLaren to be strong in that circuit.

“It's a long mid-speed corner on which they have been killing us on quite a few tracks. I remember Zandvoort, I remember Budapest. It's really the tracks where they know they have an advantage.

“Now, the gap reduced to somewhat the two tenths of Qualifying, two and a half tenths of Qualifying… but I think we were closer than that in the race. I don't know if we are just matching, or only half a tenth slower, or maybe half a tenth faster, but we are certainly not two and a half tenths slower per lap, so I think we are very close in the race.”

Keeping close to McLaren enabled Verstappen's strategy to play out, as it meant McLaren could never build enough of an advantage to pit and come back out in front – despite running in free air.

And Mekies laid the credit for the victory equally at the door of both the team and his four-time World Champion, who remains in the hunt for a fifth title.

“I will just tell you this team had never given up, kept trying, kept developing, and cracked one thing, cracked a bit more, cracked a bit more, and eventually got the car in a better place,"" he said. ""As you can see, weekend in, weekend out, it's still incredibly difficult, and that's it.

“[Verstappen] never gets it wrong, he never misses a start, he never misses a Turn 1, he's going to extract more out of the tyres than most people out there…

“The team has been extraordinary at strong executions, so it is true we have benefited from our competitors' less strong executions, but please allow me to give credit to the incredible string of massively strong races, massively strong executions from the team [who] never got a call wrong.”

Verstappen goes into the season finale in Abu Dhabi 12 points behind Norris and four ahead of Piastri. His fate is not in his own hands – even if he wins the race he is not guaranteed the title. But he is in with a shout, which when he trailed by over 100 points earlier in the season, never seemed possible.

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Bearman furious after botched Haas pit stop

Max Verstappen secured an unlikely victory in Qatar as McLaren's strategy decision backfired.

The 25-lap limitation imposed by Pirelli for its tyres around the punishing Lusail International Circuit brought on a strange Qatar Grand Prix – but it was made yet-stranger by McLaren's reaction to a Lap 7 Safety Car.

Oscar Piastri – polesitter and dominant winner of the previous day's Sprint race – looked set for a straightforward victory as he steadily pulled away from Max Verstappen in the early laps, with Lando Norris stuck behind the Red Bull in third.

But as the seventh lap began, Nico Hulkenberg, in trying to take his Sauber around the outside of Pierre Gasly for ninth place through Turns 1-2, interlocked wheels with the Alpine and spun his heavily damaged car to the side.

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Bearman furious after botched Haas pit stop

Paddock padel, podium celebrations, and plenty of celebs – here are the 2025 Qatar Grand Prix off-track moments you might have missed.

The Qatar Grand Prix always provides plenty of drama as the penultimate race of the season, and 2025 was no different. The excitement was non-stop thanks to the final Sprint weekend and entertaining support races. After all the action on track, Qatar has set the stage perfectly for a Championship showdown in Abu Dhabi next weekend...

It was a racing spectacle on-track as Max Verstappen stormed to an unexpected victory, the McLaren pair were caught out after their strategy backfired, and Carlos Sainz and Williams secured their second podium of the season. But those weren't the only stories from this epic Grand Prix weekend – so here are some magic moments you should know about.

Qatar is famously a race with intense conditions for the drivers, featuring high g-forces and even higher temperatures – so it's no wonder that many of the paddock like to unwind between sessions.

It's no secret that padel has been the go-to for many of the grid over the past few years, and lots of drivers headed to the courts before the action got underway on Friday. Ever the competitors, good friends Lando Norris and George Russell faced off against each other – we wonder which Brit got the win on the court...

As if padel wasn't vigorous enough, Pierre Gasly and reserve driver Paul Aron also joined a number of the Alpine crew in a friendly (or so we think...) football match during the weekend. That's one way to warm up ahead of the race – we'll be opting for an ice bath!

In securing their second podium of the season in Qatar, the celebrations in the Williams garage were nothing short of epic, while Sainz's P3 saw him become the first Williams driver to score multiple podium finishes in a season since 2015. It also secured the Grove-based team a mighty fifth place in the Constructors' Championship – a super impressive feat considering their P9 finish last season.

During the heartwarming team celebrations, Alex Albon sent champagne flying and Team Principal James Vowles even found himself unexpectedly tackled to the ground by Sainz's cousin and manager Carlos Onoro. If his laughter was anything to go by, he didn't seem to mind one bit – even if he may wake up with a souvenir bruise or two...!

And the feel-good podium moments just kept coming, as Red Bull also enjoyed an iconic podium return – only this one didn't come from behind the wheel.

Stepping up alongside Verstappen, Hannah Schmitz received a hero's welcome as the team celebrated another tactical masterclass from their star strategist. Her return to the podium served as a reminder of just how pivotal she remains to Red Bull's winning machine.

Is there a better way to warm up for a gruelling race weekend than yoga with a 24-time Grand Slam tennis champion? Franco Colapinto had the pleasure of joining an on-grid Yoga session with Novak Djokovic during an Alpine sponsor event – although don't expect to see this become a regular thing for the Argentinian.

It's fair to say that Colapinto may have struggled with the Serbian's stretches, admitting he “couldn't even keep up with the warm-up” on Instagram.

In a moment we're sure he's been waiting for all week, Kimi Antonelli finally received the famous LEGO podium glasses from the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Antonelli's eventual P3 was not confirmed until after the podium celebrations had concluded, as the McLaren duo were both disqualified for technical infringements during post-race checks.

Although thrilled to finish P3, Antonelli admitted he wished he could have been a part of the pre-podium celebrations in the LEGO Cadillac, so ahead of the Qatar Grand Prix weekend – a bit of the celebrations were brought to him. And with the sun out in Qatar, we're sure he wore those sunnies all weekend long!

In an epic weekend on-track, the Lusail International Circuit was abuzz with celebrities wanting to catch a flash of the action as the Championship fight took another dramatic turn. F1 fan, and paddock regular, comedian Kevin Hart had the honour of waving the drivers across the line whilst on chequered flag duty on Sunday.

World-class sports stars know a thing or two about the excitement of battling for a championship – so it was unsurprising yet thrilling to see such a high turnout of superstar athletes in the paddock over race weekend. Along with tennis legends Djokovic and Serena Williams, we also saw former England players David Beckham, Rio Ferdinand, Steven Gerrard and Gary Neville, World Cup winner Sami Khedira, and former Olympic champions Mutaz Barshim and Mo Farah.

Elsewhere in the paddock, FIFA president Gianni Infantino, TV host Steve Harvey, models Alton Mason, Adriana Lima and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, TV personality Maya Jama, and actress Jessica Alba were all spotted enjoying the race weekend.

It seemed only fitting that a race weekend as gripping as this was closed out with an epic set by rock legends Metallica, who also took time to soak in the action throughout the weekend. The group fuelled the excitement with nothing but pure motorsport ‘whiplash' – visiting several garages and stopping by to meet with F1 President & CEO Stefano Domenicali.

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Bearman furious after botched Haas pit stop

McLaren have added three new names to their Driver Development Programme, including new Formula 2 Champion Leonardo Fornaroli.

Newly-crowned Formula 2 Champion Leonardo Fornaroli has become one of three new signings to the McLaren Driver Development Programme, with the Italian joining alongside fellow F2 racer Richard Verschoor and 2025 FIA European Karting Champion Christian Costoya.

Fornaroli sealed the F2 title during the Feature Race in Qatar, the Invicta Racing driver taking P2 in the event to confirm his championship triumph following a season in which he has so far claimed four victories and five podiums.

It also marks back-to-back titles for the 20 year old, who emulated the likes of Oscar Piastri and Gabriel Bortoleto by winning the F2 championship off the back of doing the same in Formula 3 one year earlier.

Now becoming part of the McLaren family, Fornaroli will take on a test and development role within the F1 team's structure.

Also joining the programme is Verschoor, who currently sits in P3 of the Formula 2 championship ahead of the season finale in Abu Dhabi. The 24 year old from the Netherlands has won four races during the current campaign.

Another signing by McLaren is 15-year-old Costoya. The Spanish teenager has claimed multiple karting championships and is set to make his single-seater debut in the 2026 F4 Middle East Championship at the Yas Marina Circuit on January 16-18.

Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Chief Business Affairs Officer, McLaren Racing, commented: “McLaren Racing are delighted to welcome two of Formula 2's current leading drivers in this year's Champion Leonardo Fornaroli and former Championship contender and fellow front-runner Richard Verschoor, as well as proven karting champion, Christian Costoya, to the McLaren Racing Driver Development Programme.

“All three talented drivers have shown great race craft with multiple wins this season, alongside a number of impressive performances in their respective championships. By welcoming Christian to the programme alongside long-standing member, Dries Van Langendonck, we now also have two of the most promising drivers coming out of karting.

“It is a key priority that we continue to develop our talent pipeline to provide options for all of our expanding racing teams. We look forward to working closely with all our drivers in 2026 as they continue their individual development at various stages of their career with the support of the programme through a wide range of testing and progression opportunities across all of our racing series.”

Fornaroli added: “I'm incredibly proud to be joining the McLaren Driver Development Programme after another successful year on track. Winning both the FIA Formula 3 and Formula 2 titles has been an important step in my journey, and I'm motivated to take the next step in my development through the programme as I work toward my ultimate goal of racing at the highest level.

“I'm very grateful to McLaren for this opportunity, and to everyone who has supported me throughout my career so far. I can't wait to get started and work closely with the rest of the team.”

Verschoor also commented: “I'm delighted to be part of the McLaren Driver Development Programme. It's a special moment, and I'm grateful for McLaren's support in allowing me to continue my development within the programme. I'm excited to get going and work hard with the team in the coming months.”

Costoya added: “I am very excited to join the McLaren Driver Development Programme and become part of their talent pipeline. It is great to get the team's support and be in an environment that is known for developing great drivers. My thanks go to the McLaren team for this great opportunity.”

It comes after McLaren announced Ella Hakkinen and Ella Stevens as two new recruits to their Driver Development Programme last month.

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Bearman furious after botched Haas pit stop

Team Principal James Vowles reflects on Williams finishing fifth in the Teams' Championship.

Williams have secured fifth place in the Teams' Championship with one round to go, thanks to Carlos Sainz's podium finish in Qatar. The Spaniard came home third for his second rostrum of the season – third if you include Sprint results – to make sure that Williams finish on top of the midfield.

Williams finished ninth last season, with 17 points to show for their campaign. That turnaround to finish fifth this year, with 137 points and counting, means the team sit 45 points ahead of their nearest rivals with one round remaining.

“It is mathematically finished now. This surpasses our expectations really and I hope it shows the world the direction we are on and the belief we have in where we are going as a result of things,” team boss James Vowles said in the wake of the Qatar Grand Prix.

“We are still here to win championships. We are a long way away from that, a long way away. But at least now the work we are doing is starting to pay off.”

Sainz made a great start in Qatar, before managing to pick up a further place in the first round of pit stops.

His podium charge was aided by McLaren's strategy calls – with the team opting not to pit either car under the Safety Car – but nonetheless, the Spaniard had put in quick lap after quick lap to maintain enough of an advantage that Lando Norris could not reel him in late on.

Sainz duly claimed P3 for the second time in a Grand Prix this year, despite a late scare when his can began to understeer.

“We lost about eight degrees of tyre temperature on the front right, and a little bit of downforce all in one go which suggests a small component failed,” Vowles explained. “But basically, the right-hand corners he was suffering in, he did brilliantly with it. He calmly brought the car to the end of the race, so good job.

“Exceptional. Really fantastic performance from Carlos and the team when it counted and every detail adds up. Getting on the podium by milliseconds really is such a just reward for the incredible work the whole team is putting in this year.

“I was proud of Carlos and the team when we got our first podium in Baku; the second is a dream come true, but perhaps more importantly at a track that was almost our worst last year. And we've come back, we've reinvented ourselves and the result is there for everyone to see.”

Before the weekend began, both Williams drivers were quick to temper expectations here, saying the track characteristics did not suit their car. As such, getting both cars into the top 10 in Sprint Qualifying, and Sainz backing that up with a Q3 in Qualifying, showed just how far the team have come.

The Spaniard scored in the Sprint and the Grand Prix, with back-to-back top five finishes after coming home P5 in Las Vegas. Alex Albon did not manage to score in Qatar, but his consistency at the start of the season was a big factor in Williams finishing where they have done.

“For Alex, we will come back fighting in Abu Dhabi. We haven't got it all together this weekend, but I'll reiterate that his performance across the season is why we've secured fifth in the Constructors' Championship today. And more so than that, his pace is still there. We just need to bring it all together,” Vowles concluded.

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Bearman furious after botched Haas pit stop

Mark Hughes and illustrator Giorgio Piola explain the impact of changes made to Red Bull's front wing during the second half of the season.

Ever since Zandvoort, Red Bull have been paying a lot of attention to their front wing – and that seems to be at the heart of the car's improved performances compared to the first half of the season, something which has brought Max Verstappen into championship contention.

Since returning from the summer break, Verstappen has won five times in 10 races. In the 13 races before the break, he won only twice.

Although the basic Zandvoort front wing, with its big plan area, has been retained ever since, there have been multiple variations of flap shape and flexibility control.

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Bearman furious after botched Haas pit stop

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur reflects on his team scoring just four points across the Qatar Sprint weekend.

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur has conceded that they “did a worse job” than their rivals in the Qatar Grand Prix, which contributed to one of their lowest points hauls of the season.

The Scuderia ended the weekend with four points after neither driver scored in the Sprint and Charles Leclerc could only manage P8 in Sunday's race. They claimed fewer points on just one other occasion this season – their double DNF at Zandvoort.

The Monegasque driver admitted that there is “zero performance” in the car as he struggled with excessive oversteer throughout the weekend, culminating in a massive spin in Q3 that led to him starting the race in 10th place.

On the other side of the garage, things were just as bleak for Lewis Hamilton, with the former champion qualifying P18 for both the Sprint and Grand Prix. He ultimately took the chequered flag nearly 16 seconds behind Yuki Tsunoda, the last of the scorers at a circuit that has few overtaking opportunities.

Vasseur previously confirmed that Ferrari chose to switch focus to their 2026 challenger back in April, halting development on this season's car, but he insisted that the problem in Qatar was more linked to their set-up than a lack of upgrades.

“I think this weekend we struggled a lot with the set-up and prescription of the tyre pressure,” he said. “We struggled from Lap 1 to the last lap of the race. It was probably a bit better today but only marginally. It's part of the expedition, part of this weekend that due to the set-up, we were in a tough situation from Lap 1.

“I can't say that it was all positive but the collaboration and debrief was positive and we were all pushing in the same direction. I understand [the drivers'] frustration in the TV pen, but the most important thing is when they're back in the garage with the mechanics and engineers trying to find a solution. We tried this weekend but I think we had the issue – it's not a secret – with the power steering at the beginning of the weekend.

“Then you go into Qualifying and the Sprint, and you can't change between the two. We made big changes and I think it was okay-ish today but we went too far. The others are all fine-tuning but if you start miles away… I think it was in Q1 or Q2 yesterday you had two-tenths between P5 and P16. If you're out of the window, for sure you'll lose a tonne of positions and on a track like this where you have zero deg [tyre degradation], it's not easy to overtake. On top of that, you impose the two-stop.”

Vasseur also admitted that the Safety Car appearance on Lap 7 was Ferrari's “worst case scenario” discussed before the race – it prompted nine out of 10 teams to head into the pits, forcing them to use the full allocation of 25 laps on their remaining tyres.

With most of the field pitting on the same laps, Hamilton lost out due to the double stack and high volume of traffic in the pit lane, but the strategy wasn't the only struggle for the Scuderia. They were also significantly off the pace compared to McLaren, Red Bull and Mercedes, but Vasseur appeared confident that it wasn't a sign of wider issues despite the team finishing P4 in the Teams' Standings – their worst result since 2020.

“We as a team have to stay in our bubble and try to get the best from what we have,” he said. “You have to deal with this kind of situation – Max [Verstappen] was able to do it. He was P8 in Qualifying in Budapest, was P9 in the race and then he started to win races.

“You can come back, and as a team we have to understand what we did wrong this weekend. From my understanding so far, it related to the tyre pressure prescription that we struggled to deal with, but it's the same for everybody. We did a worse job than the others.

“Charles said he pushed like hell from Lap 1 on Friday morning to the last lap of the race, and I think he was probably pushing more than on some weekends where he won races. I understand the frustration that you're pushing like hell to finish P8 or P9.”

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Bearman furious after botched Haas pit stop

The F1 Nation team look back on all the biggest news and talking points from the Qatar Grand Prix weekend.

The title fight is going all the way to Abu Dhabi as Max Verstappen took victory in Qatar to ensure he remains in with a shout of a fifth straight Championship.

But the Grand Prix at the Lusail International Circuit will be remembered for McLaren's strategy calls as much as the Dutchman's victory, when the papaya team opted not to pit either Lando Norris or Oscar Piastri under a Safety Car, which ultimately cost the Australian the win and Norris a podium.

Instead, Verstappen took maximum points to jump up to second in the Championship - just 12 points behind Norris with one race to go. F1 TV commentator Jolyon Palmer and Alpine Reserve Driver Paul Aron join Tom Clarkson in the paddock to discuss all the events from a dramatic race in Qatar.

They also discuss what this result means for McLaren, with Piastri cutting a frustrated figure after the race - knowing he drove well enough to grab the win, and yet instead finds himself bumped to third in the Championship standings.

Away from the title fight, Carlos Sainz bagged a second podium of the year for a jubilant Williams team, meaning they have secured fifth in the Championship.

And Ferrari had a very difficult weekend across the board, scoring just four points courtesy of Charles Leclerc's P8 in the Grand Prix, with neither driver finishing in the points in the Sprint.

Can Ferrari turn things around and be competitive in Abu Dhabi, or are the team just going to be grateful to see the back of a very difficult season?

The finale releases globally on both Netflix and in participating theaters Dec. 31 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


Stranger Things: The Finale is coming.


	The highly anticipated final showdown of the mega-hit series will be simultaneously playing out on both the small and big screen, and Netflix on Tuesday revealed both the official runtime for the feature-length ending, as well as the locations where fans can see the final episode in movie theaters.




	First, the official run time for The Finale will be two hours and five minutes.


	Next, fan screenings of the final episode of the coming-of-age sci-fi saga will be taking place in more than 500 theaters in the U.S. and Canada starting on Dec. 31 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET — the same time the episode makes its global premiere on Netflix — and will run through Jan. 1, 2026.

	Visit www.ST5Finale.com for the full list of participating cities and theater locations and to RSVP. Exhibitors are selling a concession voucher for fans to reserve seats via an RSVP list, meaning Netflix won't earn revenue on the fan screenings.


	Netflix along with creators Matt and Ross Duffer had announced that Stranger Things: The Finale would be coming to theaters in addition to streaming back in October, reversing course on earlier statements made by the streamer that the ending would not play on the big screen.


	“We're beyond excited that fans will have the chance to experience the final episode of Stranger Things in theaters — it's something we've dreamed about for years, and we're so grateful to Ted [Sarandos], Bela [Bajaria] and everyone at Netflix for making it happen,” the Duffer brothers said at the time in a statement. “Getting to see it on the big screen, with incredible sound, picture and a room full of fans, feels like the perfect — dare we say bitchin' — way to celebrate the end of this adventure.”

	











	The Duffers elaborated further when recently speaking to The Hollywood Reporter about the final season, which released its first part of a three-part release on Nov. 26. (Volume 2 hits on Christmas with three episodes, followed by The Finale on New Year's Eve.)


	“Initially, that wasn't the plan at all,” Matt told THR of the epic ending coming to theaters. “Originally, the finale season was just going to be split into two volumes: Volume 1 and Volume 2. Then after we were done filming, Netflix approached us with the idea of putting the finale on its own day, which we thought was cool because it would allow us to pitch our movie theater idea. So we pitched them and the reason we've never pitched it before [is] because it just never really made sense given how the show is released. What's fun about seeing something in the theater, we think, is that everyone is experiencing it for the first time together. What we liked about this particular release pattern is that it allows that opportunity for a group of fans to sit and watch this unfold together.”


	Matt previously told THR that the creators have known “for a really long time” what the final scene of the series would be, and that the brothers plan to sneak into one of the participating theaters to witness the audience's reactions. “Otherwise you're just going off TikTok and YouTube videos or whatever,” he said. “We've never had that experience before, so we're excited. It's also going to sound and look better.”

	











	The Duffer Brothers recently signed a four-year exclusive deal with Paramount to create feature films after their Netflix contract ends next year. The move also follows Netflix's success in releasing KPop Demon Hunters as a sing-along theatrical event this summer. 


	Since Stranger Things debuted in 2016, the series has become one of Netflix's most popular television series ever, with its fourth season alone amassing over 140.7M views globally.


	The sprawling cast includes Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo,  Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, Maya Hawke, Priah Ferguson, Brett Gelman, Jamie Campbell Bower, Cara Buono, Amybeth McNulty, Nell Fisher, Jake Connelly, Alex Breaux and Linda Hamilton.


	Ahead of Stranger Things 5‘s release, all four previous seasons landed in the Top 10, marking the first time a series has had four previous seasons in the Top 10 all at the same time.


	Created by the Duffer brothers, Stranger Things is produced by Upside Down Pictures & 21 Laps Entertainment with the Duffer brothers as executive producers, along with Shawn Levy of 21 Laps Entertainment and Dan Cohen.

The third installment in the multi-billion dollar 'Avatar' film series opens in theaters on Dec. 19.


							By 

	Abid Rahman


International Editor, Digital


Avatar: Fire and Ash has had its first few screenings for press on Monday, and the early reaction suggests James Cameron can celebrate yet another billion dollar box office mega hit.


	While official critics reviews for Fire and Ash are embargoed till closer to the film's Dec. 19 release date, 20th Century Studios allowed press to release social media reaction to screenings this week.  




	The third installment in Cameron's groundbreaking Avatar series, sees the action return to Pandora after the events of 2022's Avatar: The Way of Water, and introduces the “Ash” people, fire-themed Na'vi clan. Fire and Ash stars Avatar regulars Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Stephen Lang, Sigourney Weaver, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder and Giovanni Ribisi. The Way of Water‘s Kate Winslet and Cliff Curtis reprise their roles.

	Given the Cameron's pedigree, and Avatar‘s unique place in pop culture, Fire and Ash‘s box office prospects look good, but the film will still need to perform heroics to keep up with the hauls of the first two chapters. 2009's Avatar, the film that ushered in the 3D film craze, made over $2.9 billion at the global box office, not adjusted for inflation. The film still holds the title of the highest grossing movie in history. 2022's The Way of Water scored an incredible $2.34 billion worldwide, a figure all the more remarkable as the theatrical industry was still reeling from a post-COVID slump. 

	











	The third film is set to be followed by Avatar 4 in 2029 and Avatar 5 in 2031. 


	See a selection of social media reaction to Avatar: Fire and Ash below. 

James Cameron's AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH is a phenomenal moviegoing experience. It's the biggest of the three — action-packed, visually jaw-dropping and rich with themes of family, legacy and survival. The way it weaves fire, water, air and land into every nook and cranny of the film… pic.twitter.com/aNO5xOXs5x

There's too much “been there done that” in terms of plot beats and set pieces, but AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH is still an awe-inspiring technical and visceral achievement. It doesn't skimp on the melodrama or intensity, as James Cameron delivers a towering spectacle of such all-in… pic.twitter.com/dTIxhG8hT6

#Avatar FIRE AND ASH is a knockout. An epic that delivers on an enormous scale, with the characters & worldbuilding paying off surprising dividends. It's a delight to see a film be this big while still being a narratively & visually bold work of science-fiction. The best one yet. pic.twitter.com/2bu9DGrg9r

With #AvatarFireAndAsh master storyteller and visionary filmmaker James Cameron again delivers a hyperreal experience that is emotional and exhilarating. Repeatedly and exhaustively raising its own bar, this is an audacious feast that delivers more than anyone ordered. #Avatar pic.twitter.com/RrkGINBrpO

#AvatarFireAndAsh: 3 films in, James Cameron still has the sauce, making the epic spectacular feel emotionally impactful. A glorious saga. Bold, brilliant & awesome in every way, this is what movie theaters were built for. Payakan is still my fave, but Varang is the MVP. pic.twitter.com/zs1BjCTYmZ

AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH is a monumental cinematic achievement. Astonishing, boundary-pushing visuals are accompanied by an enthralling narrative filled with poignant commentary and genuinely moving character work. By far, the best Avatar movie. Epic. Ambitious. Heartfelt. A must see pic.twitter.com/pEgPkwKBZj

#Avatar: Fire and Ash is another visually fantastic epic that also contains a couple of the most emotional moments in the series.On the other hand, I had some issues with the third act and Way of Water remains the peak for me. But damn Cameron delivers spectacle like no one else pic.twitter.com/16uVIXDikG

#AvatarFireAndAsh is a damn good James Cameron movie! What else do you need to know?? Go see it in 3-D in the best theater you can find because it'll blow your mind. That's what JC does. Every bit as gorgeous as you'd expect, Fire and Ash is also easily the most INTENSE Avatar… pic.twitter.com/uW5M476NKW

I saw #AvatarFireAndAsh! I was surprised at how well the movie plunges you right back into Pandora, and makes it every bit as stunning and thrilling as it has always been. I admire how earnest these movies are. It's exactly as good as the first two and deserves as many billions.

AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH is overstuffed with a lot of plot, further dragged down by repeating familiar beats from the previous entries. But Cameron still delivers amazing spectacle, with an intriguing darker tone. There's novel concepts here I wish were more thoroughly explored. pic.twitter.com/O6Q6fn7iT2

#AvatarFireAndAsh is extraordinary. James Cameron delivers another visual feast that has an emotional, action packed story centered around the impact of grief and hatred. Oona Chaplin is this film's beautifully unhinged standout as Varang. Already want to see it again! https://t.co/ABZBCj7zYr

Never doubt James Cameron. AVATAR: FIRE & ASH is another sprawling, ambitious, gorgeous adventure. Oona Chaplin is the best new element – she's iconic, she's gaggy, etc, and her ash tribe rocks. Cameron expands the series' visual capacity with some innovative, trippy sequences. pic.twitter.com/fxAa7lkSZT

#AvatarFireAndAsh — there's no denying that the spectacle of these films are unmatched. This one is bigger, louder, sharper. The 3D experience was truly something to behold. However, outside of a SPECTACULAR Oona Chaplin & a fascinating new tribe, the story is frustratingly… pic.twitter.com/4gCezW8piD

AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH is a propulsive, visually stunning blockbuster on par with other installments. Using action-packed spectacle to elevate a solid narrative into a thrilling experience with the best technical craftmanship of all time, it's worth a watch for fans of the trilogy pic.twitter.com/5tXxyb1lQT

#AvatarFireAndAsh is the most awe-inspiring movie I've seen all year. James Cameron continues to be a true visionary in cinema, but it's Weaver and Champion who are the heart and soul of this beautiful movie. Seeing this in anything but IMAX 3D should be a federal crime. pic.twitter.com/3QZsG1iyAA

AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH is the first James Cameron sequel that feels kinda like a regular follow-up rather than an innovative re-envisioning of its predecessor's world. It also just casually drops ~3-4 of the best/coolest action sequences of the year and I was rapt the whole time.

Avatar: Fire and Ash has some fun action set pieces but boy if it isn't mostly a repetitive bore. Virtually identical to The Way of Water and feels pointless. Liked the legacy Oona Chaplin brought but a pretty generic villain. These movies also never need to be three hours long. pic.twitter.com/DOIh25gIDC

Avatar: Fire and Ash (2025) – the messiest entry has me tempered, despite a thematic thorniness that's so intriguing. There's still plenty to be stunned by, including Cameron tapping back into an amorous energy I haven't seen from him in ages, all due to an excellent Oona Chaplin pic.twitter.com/IgFh2BUxl4

FIRE AND ASH is the biggest, heaviest, most epic #Avatar film to date. It plays like a Part 2 to The Way of Water's Part 1, with much of its runtime on grief and the fallout of war. This time, it's the performances that linger. Sam Worthington and Stephen Lang are even better… pic.twitter.com/ufHK5itHL5

Avatar: Fire and Ash is gorgeous to look at & certainly has its moments, but it falls into the same trap of repetition as the previous films. Lots of set up for little payoff, but at least we get some great action sequences. Varang is a fun new addition. Far too long. #Avatar pic.twitter.com/fFAd6M6Qrd

Three films in and I still can't get over how magical the #Avatar movies are. Wish I had more original phrasing, but this applies too well — #AvatarFireAndAsh truly feels like a ride. I couldn't believe how quickly I was pulled back into the world of Pandora and swept up in the… pic.twitter.com/TdmAxp4ELQ

We all thought James Cameron was making his Star Wars, #AvatarFireAndAsh cements it as his Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy (highly complimentary). This is so At World's End coded & Cameron has fully embraced the anime & video game inspos even more proudly here. A nonstop series… pic.twitter.com/pDOQNgaEKz

AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH plays best having just seen THE WAY OF WATER because it feels like a Part 2 of that story. I was blown away by the visuals, the score, and many performances. But goddammit, you gotta see this thing in Dolby 3D (1.85:1)! It's unreal how immersive it is. pic.twitter.com/8Rd03dzBFE

#AvatarFireAndAsh is so wildly, unfathomably epic, ambitious, and audacious in every single way, you can't help but forgive that it has some noticeable flaws.It grabs you and sweeps you up in this snowball of emotion, action, and spectacle as only James Cameron can deliver. pic.twitter.com/iLLDSskFEG

AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH delivers the most emotional moments of the franchise and is, by far, the most epic in both scope and runtime, yet it also mines the least amount of new material from covering so much ground. Still, the breathtaking visual effects, world-building, and evolving… pic.twitter.com/JhFGiLyA2j

Comcast, Netflix and Paramount submitted their revised offers Monday, including an almost all-cash deal from Netflix, and a cash deal from Paramount backed by Apollo and Middle East funds.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	The future of Warner Bros. Discovery is hanging in the balance, with the entertainment company's board of directors now weighing second round bids for the company from Comcast, Paramount and Netflix.


	The offers were due Monday, and all three companies submitted their revised plans.




	While the specific cash amounts were not immediately clear (also complicated by the fact that only Paramount is pursuing the whole company), the second round bids included some notable tweaks. Netflix, for example, is now a mostly cash bid, after initially leaning on its stock as a key part of the deal.

	And Paramount is offering all-cash, having secured debt financing from the private equity giant Apollo, as well as unknown Middle East sovereign wealth funds. The nature of the debt financing means that Ellison and Redbird will retain total control of Paramount if they are successful in their bid.




			Related Video		







	Barring any surprise late bidders or a call by the WBD board to continue with their split, one of the three media giants is likely to emerge as the buyer of assets that include the venerable Warner Bros. film and TV studios, HBO and HBO Max, and IP that includes DC Comics, Friends, and Harry Potter.


	So what happens next? WBD's board will need to weigh the new offers, and either request a third round of bids if they feel they can extract more compelling offers, or pick a winner and start working on a binding agreement.

	











To split or not to split: This is in many ways the fundamental question about the future of WBD. The company was planning to split itself in two: A streaming and studio business, and a linear TV business. Paramount wants the whole thing, while Comcast and Netflix want to stay away from linear. Does the company sell itself whole (likely to Paramount) or split itself, either in a sale or a continuation of its previous process?


Regulatory hell: The Trump administration has made it clear that David Ellison and his father Larry Ellison would have an easier regulatory path, fresh off their deal for Paramount. At the same time, anonymous administration sources have made it clear to friendly voices like Fox Business Network and the New York Post's Charlie Gasparino that Netflix and Comcast would face scrutiny. How tough will the government be? And will it dissuade the WBD board from cutting a deal with anyone that doesn't have the last name Ellison?


Film's future: Netflix is not in the theatrical film business, really. NBCUniversal and Paramount are. But if the WBD studios are sold, what happens to its film studio, which has had a breakout year under the leadership of Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy? Netflix has reportedly promised continues theatrical releases, but does that mean the same sort of wide release WB has done? Or a Netflix-ified version? Would NBCU or Paramount really just double their film output? Or is the future of WB more like 20th Century Fox, as a niche with a few releases under the larger umbrella?

	











Sports superpower: WBD may have lost its NBA rights, but its portfolio still includes prime MLB and NHL deals, one half of the March Madness college basketball tourney (Paramount has the rest) and other rights that include the French Open and college football. When added to the portfolios of Paramount or NBCU, it could make for a compelling sports proposition, a sports media giant that would rival only ESPN in scale. But with those rights set to travel with the linear TV business, their future remains uncertain.


What about Zas? WBD CEO David Zaslav has made no secret of his love of the game. He hosts star-studded dinners at his Beverly Hills mansion (once known as Woodland, the estate of mogul Robert Evans), he has sought out meetings and held court at his U.S. Open suite with A-listers and tycoons. Would he really hang up his power suit (or power vest?) that easily? Paramount has reportedly offered him a major role, so it stands to reason that others may make similar offers as further enticement for a deal.


Mystery bidder: We know that Paramount, Comcast and Netflix have submitted bids, but that doesn't preclude a surprise bidder entering the fray. Perhaps, say, a private equity firm backed by Middle Eastern money? Or a Japanese entertainment conglomerate with an American partner? Don't count out any surprises.

			By Nellie Andreeva, Rosy Cordero 


EXCLUSIVE: In a star pairing of two top English actors of their generation, Nicholas Hoult (Superman) and Daisy Edgar-Jones (Twisters) are set as the leads of Mosquito, a Hulu original series from Oscar-nominated writer Tony McNamara (Poor Things), which has received a six-episode straight-to-series order. Part of Disney+‘s UK original slate, the dark, wry comedy will stream on Disney+ internationally and Hulu in the U.S.


	Described as a sardonic look at a young couple's relationship, Mosquito brings Hoult, Edgar-Jones and McNamara back to Hulu where they were part of two signature 2020 series. McNamara created and Hoult starred in the comedy-drama The Great, which ran for three seasons, while Edgar-Jones starred in the limited series Normal People. Both shows were hits with viewers and critics, landing Golden Globe acting nominations for Hoult and Edgar-Jones and Best TV Series – Musical or Comedy for McNamara. (Hoult and McNamara, along with female lead Elle Fanning, also earned Emmy nominations for their work on The Great.)

Mosquito channels the dark, absurdist humor of The Great — as well as McNamara's film work — while exploring the next stage in a young couple's relationship which Normal People fans wished to see Marianne (Edgar-Jones) and Connell (Paul Mescal) embark on. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The series centers on Kate (Edgar-Jones) and Ed (Hoult), a recently married couple whose secrets begin to reveal as daily life chips away at the personas they present… all started by an intrusive mosquito.

	











	“I'm thrilled and excited to work with and team up two of the best actors around,” said Mosquito writer and executive producer McNamara. “I can't wait to go make absurd comedy with them.”


	The series is produced by 20th Television, Piggy Ate Roast Beef Productions and Hustle & Punch. McNamara executive produces with Hoult, Edgar-Jones, Marian Macgowan, former ABC Signature president-turned-producer Tracy Underwood under her 20th TV overall deal, and Daniel Pipski. The series was commissioned for Disney+ by Lee Mason, Disney EMEA executive director. Filming begins in 2026.


	This marks the first major UK series greenlight since Eric Schrier, President, Disney Television Studios and Global Original Television Strategy, The Walt Disney Co., appointed Angela Jain as Head of Content, Disney+ EMEA in June.


	“Tony is one of the most talented writers working in film and television today, with a legacy of incredible success at Disney,” Schrier and Jain said in a joint statement. 


	All of McNamara's projects released over the past seven years have been for Disney entities: The Great for Hulu on the TV side and movies The Favourite, Poor Things and The Roses for Searchlight and Cruella for Walt Disney Pictures. His collaborations with Yorgos Lanthimos on The Favourite and Poor Things earned McNamara two writing Oscar nominations and a BAFTA award.  


	“He has an unmatched ability to bring fascinating and complex stories to life weaving sharply written, intricate dialogue with signature dark-humor and complexity,” Schrier and Jain continued. “Partnering with him on Mosquito is an incredible step forward for our local original content and reinforces our ambitions in the UK.”


	Disney+'s UK originals slate delivered a breakout hit in Rivals, which last week won the International Emmy for drama series. It is expected to return for Season 2 in 2026. 


	Edgar-Jones has three high-profile movies coming up, Sense and Sensibility, A Place In Hell with Michelle Williams and Here Comes the Flood with Denzel Washington and Robert Pattinson. She is repped by UTA, B-Side Management and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern.


	Coming off Superman and Nosferatu, Hoult will next be seen in How To Rob a Bank opposite Anna Sawai, Pete Davidson and Zoë Kravitz and also has Tom Ford's next film Cry to Heaven and a return as Lex Luther in Superman sequel Man of Tomorrow lined up. He is repped by UTA, 42 and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern.


	Australian-born McNamara is repped by UTA, Sugar23, HLA Management and Frankfurt, Kurnit, Klein & Selz.

					By Jesse Whittock 

International TV Co-Editor


Adolescence director Philip Barantini has said “there is no sequel” to the Netflix global smash hit series.


	There has been much speculation about Season 2 of the one-shot drama, with the likes of PDede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner from Plan B Entertainment telling Deadline that they had spoken to Barantini about the “next iteration” of the show.


	In a talk about the British show's secret sauce at Content London today, Barantini, who co-created the show with star Stephen Graham, made his first comments about its future. As he described the making of the show and his positive experience on set, he poured cold water on a direct second season.

	“For me, it's about ultimately working with good people, nice people,” he said. “There is no sequel to this, but we as a collective want to continue to work together on multiple things,” he said. “We captured lightning in a bottle in terms of how we shot it, I but also the reach we had. That doesn't mean every project going forwards can't have the same ethos.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Barantini, Thorne and Warp producer Emily Feller appeared on stage to talk about the show. Graham was also billed to attend, but a filming clash meant he didn't appear.


	Barantini's It's All Made Up Productions co-produced the Emmy-winning Adolescence with Brad Pitt's Plan B and UK producer Warp Films, with prolific UK writer Jack Thorne also attached. 


	Thorne has previously said Season 2 would not happen as the story of troubled teenager Jamie, played by Emmy winner Owen Cooper, was complete, while Graham has made similar noises. However, speculation has remained as to whether it could still return.


	Following Adolescence‘s success, Boiling Point director Barantini is increasingly in demand. Last week, we revealed he and Netflix are working together to develop Jade Franks' one-woman play Eat the Rich (But Maybe Not Me Mates X) into a TV series. The streamer and the director are also pairing up for Hell Jumper, a feature film based on the 2024 documentary of the same name. We were also first with that news.

	











Adolescence, which made headlines for filming one continuous shot in each of its four episodes, follows the tragic story of a family whose teenage son, played by a debuting Cooper, is arrested and eventually jailed for the murder of a teenage girl. While the creators had assumed it would cut through with the British public, which was in the midst of a debate around incel culture and teen violence, it broke through globally and became one of Netflix's biggest original shows, surpassing Baby Reindeer as its most viewed UK title.


	Thorne, who has written the likes of This is England and Toxic Town, pointed the unexpected global success and posited the question as to whether Adolescence would have sold as territory-by-territory given it is set on a northern town and was addressing a particular debate in the UK.


	“If we were on Channel 4, we would have done well [in the UK], but I'd be interested whether we'd have sold abroad,” he said. “Would other countries have wanted to buy this show? My experience is the shows that don't sell are the one with regional accents, where it's about something particuarly British. I don't know if we would have got those international sales.”


	Thorne pointed to Mr Bates vs the Post Office, the ITV drama about the post office workers whose lives were destroyed by a faulty computer system, as an example of a critical British hit that did not shop globally. “ITV did very well and it did very in their slate through advertising. ITV Studios couldn't sell it across enough countries to turn a profit,” he said.


	Thorne also questioned the bravery of commissioners, claiming that many writers were failing to get shows made due to an over-reliance on crime programs.”Writers are being trapped in cul-de-sacs,” he said. “One thing Adolescence hasn't changed at all is that if you want to get a show away, you need a body in it and someone who is a bit sad investigating. 


	“When I was growing up, there were such a wide variety of shows on TV. I do think crime has taken hold… Writers with amazing leaps of imagination are being boxed into these places.”

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	After a multi-country casting search, young English actor Jack Alldridge has landed the lead in Foster Dade, Hulu‘s YA drama pilot written by Greg Berlanti and Bash Doran and directed by Daniel Minahan, which comes from Warner Bros. TV and studio-based Berlanti Productions.


	Based on Nash Jenkins' debut novel Foster Dade Explores the Cosmos, Foster Dade takes place in 2008 and present day. It is described as a sophisticated mystery set at an East Coast boarding school that explores privilege, scandal, sexuality and masculinity amid the rise of social media, millennial anxiety and pharmaceuticals.

	The story revolves around Foster Dade (Alldridge), a new transfer student at the elite Kennedy boarding school. He arrives at Kennedy as a lonely, anxious, ferocious reader who self-medicates and blogs at his psychologist's insistence. Possessed of a depth of soul Foster doesn't yet know what to do with, he aches to be liked, to fall in love, to be known in a way his fractured home life never allowed. He has no idea that his hunger for reinvention will place him at the center of the greatest scandal the school has ever seen and that his name will be whispered by Kennedy students for decades to come.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Alldridge joins previously cast Chloe East, who plays the female lead Annabeth, a popular girl at Kennedy who takes Foster under her wing; Cameron Mann, who portrays fellow student Jack Albright; and Matt Bomer, who plays Alex Tierney, a brilliant teacher at the school.

	











	Berlanti Prods.' Berlanti, Sarah Schechter and Leigh London Redman executive produce alongside Doran, Jenkins, Robbie Rogers as well as Donald De Line of De Line Pictures. Filming on the pilot is slated to begin today, Dec. 2, in New York.


	A 2023 graduate of the Guildford School of Acting, Alldridge plays President James A. Garfield's (Michael Shannon) son Harry in Netflix's recently released limited series Death by Lightning. He also stars in the 2025 Christmas commercial of UK department store chain John Lewis — a British holiday staple — which has been viewed more than 2 million times on YouTube alone since its debut a month ago. (You can watch it below.)


	”We knew the titular character of Foster Dade would be the heart and soul of this show. We needed an actor that could embody the full range of emotion and toe the line between hero and anti-hero,” Berlanti, Schechter and Doran said in a statement. “After a worldwide search and seeing thousands of talented young actors we were lucky enough to find Jack Alldridge. Fresh out of drama school, Jack is an extraordinary talent. He has a bright future ahead and we are lucky to be a part of it.”


	Alldridge will next be seen in the BritBox/ITV1 series The Lady and Season 15 of BBC/PBS' Call The Midwife, both slated for release in 2026. He is repped by Hatch, Anonymous Content and CAA.

Political Editor


UPDATED, with White House comment: Sabrina Carpenter blasted the White House on Tuesday for using her song Juno in an ICE deportation video.


	Carpenter wrote on X that the video “is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”


	The White House posted the video on Monday, featuring images of ICE officers detaining individuals, set to Carpenter's song as a soundtrack. Quoting from the lyrics, the White House posted on X, “Have you ever tried this one? Bye-bye.” 


	White House Abigail Jackson said in response, “Here's a Short n' Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: we won't apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country. Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The White House has featured the songs of other artists in deportation and other videos, raising their anger over their use without their OK. In October, Kenny Loggins objected to the use of his song Danger Zone in an AI generated video that depicted Trump dropping feces on No Kings protesters.


	“This is an unauthorized use of my performance of ‘Danger Zone.' Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately,” Loggins wrote. His music remains in the video on Trump's Truth Social account.

If only she and her label could find lawyers to go after them like they do internet companies.

Copyrights don't exist for Mother MAGA. In fact rights of any kind don't exist. If you send a check to his library maybe he'll consider using YMCA next time.

The best thing any of these “artists” can do is move out of LA, because their narrow worldview is wildly inconsistent with the mainstream public.

If the mainstream public supports the current incarnation of ICE and all they have been doing, then God help America

then they wouldn't have access to the davos class's astroturfing machine that gives them the illusion of fame, who selects people like sabrina because they willfully and ignorantly evangelize their agenda.

International Reporter


	Actress Sonoya Mizuno is set to make her directorial debut with a project titled Stages, backed by Film4 and A24. 


	Specific details about the project remain under wraps, but we are told Mizuno's own dance background inspires the story.


	Mizuno trained at the Royal Ballet School in London. She then danced in several ballet companies, including the English National Ballet, Dresden Semper Oper Ballet, and Scottish Ballet.


	Sonoya made her screen acting debut in Alex Garland's Ex Machina. Her other film credits include Annihilation, Crazy Rich Asians, La La Land, and Shortcomings. Her television credits include the lead role in Devs, as well as Maniac and House of the Dragon.

	











Stages will be produced by Peter Rice, and Agile Films' Myles Payne and Sam Ritzenberg, alongside Alex Garland, with whom Mizuno has had a long on-screen collaboration. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Speaking with Deadline about working with Garland on Devs in 2020, Mizuno said: “He's always open to people giving their ideas, he takes them on, and it feels like a very equal place.” 


	“I'd say for me, a lot of the collaboration would be between me, Alex, and Rob Hardy, the DP, because this was the third thing we were doing together, the three of us. By this point, we'd developed this working relationship, which had always felt collaborative and also unique to the three of us.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","All the details on Miley Cyrus' engagement ring from Maxx Morando","https://pagesix.com/2025/12/02/style/miley-cyrus-engagement-ring-from-maxx-morando-all-the-details/","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 15:24:00 GMT","

Miley Cyrus has something beautiful on her left ring finger.

The pop star, 33, flashed her brand new engagement ring on the red carpet for “Avatar: Fire And Ash” on Monday, showing off the jewelry while posing arm-in-arm with fiancé Maxx Morando. 

The cushion cut sparkler is a 14-karat gold creation by celeb-favorite jewelry designer Jacquie Aiche, a rep for the company tells Page Six Style.

Marion Fasel, jewelry historian and founder of the online jewelry magazine The Adventurine, tells Page Six Style that the rock is an east-west set natural diamond. “Given the skyrocketing price of gold, it makes sense that the metal plays almost as big a role as the diamond in the piece,” she says.

“The design is in the same mode as Dua Lipa's engagement ring,” Fasel continues. “Other than that, there isn't much historical precedent. It's a new trend in engagement rings. In the past, this style would have been worn on the right hand. I love it as an engagement ring because it looks and feels substantial.”

Daniela Tarantino, VP of Merchandising at Blue Nail, offered her estimate, speculating, “We believe the ring is roughly a 4-5 carat modified cushion that costs around $300K-$450k.” However, the true size and cost of the eye-catching engagement ring remain up for debate, as a representative for the jewelry designer declined to comment.

At the Dolby Theatre premiere, Cyrus placed her hand on the chest of her beau of four years, giving photographers a clear view of the rock.

The Grammy Winner coordinated with Morando, 27, in matching all-black looks. The “Hannah Montana” alum dazzled in a sequined strapless Gucci gown with a dramatic ruffled train, while the Liily drummer looked dapper in a classic tuxedo.

Aiche is also behind many A-list stars' most sentimental pieces, including Selena Gomez's custom “B” initial ring for then-fiancé Benny Blanco and Gigi Hadid's “Mama” necklace, which the model debuted after the birth of her daughter Khai in 2020.

Cyrus, for her part, is a longtime fan of Aiche's work, having accessorized with the designer's dainty body chains and diamond earrings on many occasions. 

She also wore Jacquie Aiche earrings when she married her ex, Liam Hemsworth, in December 2018. The couple were together on and off for a decade, but split after less than a year of marriage.

The engagement news comes just months after Hemsworth announced his own engagement to model Gabriella Brooks in September 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Will Smith's longtime friend claims Jada Pinkett Smith threatened his life in $3M lawsuit","https://pagesix.com/2025/12/01/celebrity-news/will-smiths-longtime-friend-claims-jada-pinkett-smith-threatened-his-life-in-3m-lawsuit/","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 02:35:00 GMT","

Jada Pinkett Smith is being accused of threatening harm to her husband Will Smith's former close friend for revealing details about her personal life in a bombshell new lawsuit.

In the lawsuit filed on Nov. 7, Bilaal Salaam — who refers to himself as Will's “best friend for nearly 40 years” — claims Jada confronted him at Will's birthday party on Sept. 25, 2021, held at the Regency Calabasas Common.

“While in the lobby, Jada Pinkett Smith approached Plaintiff with approximately seven members of her entourage, became verbally aggressive, and threatened Plaintiff by stating that if he continued ‘telling her personal business,' he would ‘end up missing or catch a bullet,' and demanded he sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) ‘or else,'” the lawsuit obtained by Page Six claims

Salaam alleges that an associate of Jada's then followed him to his car and continued making verbal threats against him.

In the lawsuit, he claims “a retaliatory campaign” was later launched against him after he refused to help with crisis management following Will slapping Chris Rock at the 2022 Oscars. 

Salaam claims he refused to perform tasks he “believed were illegal, unethical, or morally compromising,” per the docs.

Salaam is also suing Jada for “intentional infliction of emotional distress” because she denied to TMZ that she had ever seen Will engage in any sexual or intimate behavior with men.

“This was a false denial, as Plaintiff had already released a viral video showing Will Smith groping Alfonso Ribeiro (including his penis, nipple, and buttocks) in front of Defendant and her children, who were visibly present,” according to the lawsuit. (Ribeiro has never commented on the claims). 

Salaam claims in the lawsuit that Jada's “false denial” was a deliberate effort to discredit him and imply that his prior statements about Will were “inaccurate, delusional, or fabricated, causing severe public ridicule and loss of credibility.”

More allegations include that he was threatened by a manager on behalf of Jada to “work something out” and to “end this feud before you get physically hurt” in regards to a memoir he was planning to release.

Salaam claims his reputation was destroyed, his health deteriorated, and that he suffered financial loss and emotional trauma as a result of Jada's alleged “malicious, intentional, and reckless conduct,” per the lawsuit.

He's seeking $3 million in damages.

Reps for Jada and Will didn't immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment.

This isn't the first time Salaam has made accusations against Will. In November 2023, Will's rep denied Salaam's claims that he caught Will having sex with actor Duane Martin.

“This story is completely fabricated and the claim is unequivocally false,” his rep told TMZ at the time.

A new trailer for Taylor Swift's forthcoming Disney+ docuseries spotlights the emotional speech she delivered during her final Eras Tour concert.

The “Opalite” singer expressed her gratitude to thousands of Swifties in the stands at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver on Dec. 8, 2024, according to a teaser for “Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show.”

“We've had so long to prepare for the end of this tour, and we get to play one last show for you here tonight,” she told concertgoers at the time.

“I want to thank every single one of you for being a part of the most thrilling chapter of my entire life to date,” she added.

Swift, 35, announced in the teaser that the film, which premieres Dec. 12, will include a new acoustic set.

She was seen singing the beginning lyrics to her song “Long Live” — the final track of her 2010 album, “Speak Now” — while playing the piano in a sparkly purple gown.

The six-episode special features behind-the-scenes moments from her tour, including rehearsals, her life on the road and plenty of PDA with her fiancé, Travis Kelce.

Other notable faces featured in the project include Sabrina Carpenter, who opened for several of Swift's shows, as well as her collaborators Gracie Abrams and Ed Sheeran.

“The Eras Tour | The Final Show, featuring the entire Tortured Poets Department set, and the first two episodes of The End of an Era, a 6-episode behind-the-scenes docuseries will be yours December 12th on @disneyplus,” she announced in an Instagram post at the time. 

Swift was also busy writing two new albums during the record-breaking world tour, releasing “The Tortured Poets Department” in April 2024 and “The Life of a Showgirl” in October 2025. 

The pop star also re-recorded her “Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and” and “1989 (Taylor's Version)” while touring the globe.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The secret to box office success is sequels to Zootopia and Wicked","https://www.avclub.com/zootopia-2-weekend-box-office-thanksgiving-2025","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 00:31:00 GMT","

With family dinners now firmly out of fashion thanks to TikTok, there's only one thing left that can bring families together: Sequels to box office smash hits about misunderstood villains. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, Zootopia 2 had a massive Thanksgiving weekend for Disney, which has been clinging to its emotional support Lilo & Stitch remake all year as Snow White, Elio, and Tron: Ares crashed out over a cruel 2025. But now that Disney has released its final Jared Leto-led film of the year, it can relish Zooptopia 2‘s $98 million opening weekend and its collective domestic five-day take of $158 million, per The Numbers. Worldwide, the movie has grossed $559 million, making Zooptopia 2 the largest global opening for an animated film ever and the second-largest global opening behind Avengers: Endgame.

Movie theaters cleaned up this weekend, and it's essentially thanks to having two movies in wide release that appeal to families. Despite a noticeable drop-off in enthusiasm from the first movie, Wicked: For Good continued to do good. In its second weekend, the film earned $61 million, sending Jon M. Chu's sequel over the $200 million mark. In total, Wicked: For Good has grossed $390 million worldwide, an incredible figure made modest by Zootopia 2. No wonder studios put all their money in tentpoles. If one hits, you make a lot of money very, very quickly.

Sequels ruled the rest of the top five. Now You Three Me and Predator: Badlands took in $6.9 million and $4.8 million, respectively. Neither has made $100 million domestic, but overseas, both are doing quite well—unless, of course, the studios expected Zootopia money, in which case they're bombs. Speaking of which, Edgar Wright's Running Man is limping at this point, adding another $3.7 million to a $60 million global take. We imagine the movie will find its audience on planes and Paramount+.

While much of the top 10 remains stagnant, there were some interesting additions. Netflix rarely reports its box office grosses, but it claims the latest Knives Out mystery, Wake Up Dead Man, took in $1.5 million in 600 theaters. That's a considerable drop-off from the $9.2 million that Glass Onion made in its opening weekend in November 2022 during the film's brief theatrical release. While it might be easy to say people are waiting to watch this one on Netflix, there was stiffer competition in 2025 than three years ago. Glass Onion opened in 696 theaters against the third weekend of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and the Disney misfire Strange World.

A24's afterlife rom-com, Eternity, and Chloé Zhao's “emotional wrecking ball,” Hamnet, served as counterprogramming for the childless. Without the additional child-priced ticket sales, Eternity returned $3.1 million in its opening weekend. Meanwhile, Hamnet, still in limited release, made just shy of $1 million. People need to find out how Shakespeare came up with the idea for Hamlet, and the answer is a one-way ticket to a depressing holiday classic.

Here's the full top 10:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Meghan Trainor Quit a Bad Habit Because of a Psychic's Message","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/meghan-trainor-quit-coffee-psychic-message/","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 17:23:56 GMT","

Meghan Trainor recently revealed that a health scare led to her 60-pound weight loss. Now, she's admitted that she quit a bad habit because a psychic had a dire message for the star.

“The psychic never met me,” Trainor told People. “My husband [Daryl Sabara] was gifted a session with her and she said, ‘Your wife is … non-stop [when it comes to drinking coffee] and it's not helping her and she's just crashing out.'”

“I was like, ‘How does she know that?' And he came home and told me, and I immediately stopped,” the singer revealed. “Cold turkey just stopped because I was drinking it all day to just survive and be steady and then I would crash and be buzzing at night to sleep.”

Noting that her “adrenals were shot” and her hormones were “so off,” Trainor also told People, “I wasn't feeling great. And I was like, ‘I don't understand. I eat so healthy, I work out. Why do I feel like this?' And I realized I was overworking myself.”

While quitting resulted in a “tough week” for Trainor, she explained that she now has “more energy than ever.”

She added, “It was life-changing.”

Trainor is set to launch a tour in June 2026, and intends to tackle it in the same way she has in the past, telling People, “No sleep, power through and thrive.”

“We get up at 7 a.m. because the kids get up at 7 a.m. and then we go find an amusement park or a museum. They love children's museums… then we eat lunch together, I do a soundcheck, we have early dinner so that I don't burp on stage,” she said of the family's time on the road.

“And after soundcheck, I'm in full glam, like pop star outfit, and I'm helping our incredible nanny Leslie, who helps us out and my husband and my mom,” she added. “There's four of us on two kids trying to get them in a bath that we unfold to put in this shower. It's chaos.”

Trainor continued by saying, “Then once they're good to go, we walk them to the bus and they go to bed. And then I do the show and I get to sleep at about 11 or midnight. And then we get up and it's Groundhog Day and we do it all over again.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jennifer Aniston & Beau Step Out in Coordinating Cuteness","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/jennifer-aniston-jim-curtis-nyc-outing/","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 03:54:53 GMT","

On Saturday Nov. 29, beloved actress Jennifer Aniston and her man, wellness entrepreneur and hypnotherapist Jim Curtis, stepped out in cozy yet stylish winter wear in New York City. Following a holiday weekend brunch at Cafe Cluny in the West Village, People snapped a few shots of the pair braving the chilly temperatures. 

An onlooker told People that they “smiled and looked very happy” during their NYC afternoon. Since Aniston hard-launched their relationship via Instagram on Nov 2 on his 50th birthday, this is their first major holiday spent together. And with Christmas just around the corner, this next month is sure to be memorable!  

The two first sparked dating rumors way back in May of 2025 when she included a photo of Curtis's book, “Shift,” in an Instagram carousel. Page Six then caught them canoodling on a swanky yacht in Mallorca, and snapped shots of them holding hands and leaning close to one another. Following their vacation, they enjoyed a lengthy dinner date with Jason Bateman and Amanda Anka, further fueling speculation. And then… Aniston's Instagram confirmation. 

Two days later, Curtis included Aniston in one of his posts and the rest, as they say, is history. Or, in this case, just beginning. 

Aniston and Curtis recently made their first official appearance as lovebirds at ELLE's Women in Hollywood event on Nov. 17 in Beverly Hills. She was honored at the soiree and when her pal Adam Sandler introduced her, he gushed over both his friend and her new beau. “When we are around you, me and [wife] Jackie Sandler are so happy you and Jim found each other and are having the love affair you two deserve. We love you, Jim. The whole world loves you.”

Those are certainly some powerful words for a friend's boyfriend, but if they're any indication of the happiness he's brought into her life, then safe to say that fans echo Sandler's same sentiment! 

Whether viewers remember Aniston from “Friends,” or know her for her latest turn on “The Morning Show,” or are anxiously awaiting her juicy upcoming role in the TV adaptation of Jennette McCurdy's memoir, “I'm Glad My Mom Died,” we're all optimistically rooting for them.   





I have to say this is a match made by god, to the both of yous, right on, and bless you both for the rest of your days, right on,much love and respect and blessings!

Time for the Playoffs on “The Voice” season 28 tonight on NBC. We have the first eight artists singing for their coaches — Reba McEntire, Michael Bublé, Niall Horan, and Snoop Dogg — to earn a spot in the Live Finale in two weeks on “The Voice” 2025. Viewers will get their first chance to vote for their favorite artists on “The Voice” 2025.  Who moves on and who is eliminated on “The Voice” tonight? Watch with us during our “The Voice” season 28 live recap below and find out with us.

We kick things off with the Playoffs on “The Voice” season 28 tonight. There are 16 artists remaining on this season, and tonight we get to see half of them take the stage for a shot at a spot in the Voice Finale in two weeks. For tonight, it will be Team Reba and Team Bublé performing for their coaches, with one spot for each team open in the Voice Finale. Then it goes to America to vote, so watch with us to see who stays and who goes home. Find out with us during our Live Recap below!

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD: THIS LIVE RECAP WILL BE UPDATED THROUGHOUT THE EPISODE, SO DO NOT KEEP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ SPOILERS.

KEEP REFRESHING THE PAGE FOR THE LATEST “THE VOICE” LIVE RECAP UPDATES.

Time for the Playoffs to begin. Team Reba and Team Bublé will be performing tonight. Each coach gets to pick one artist to represent them in the Live Finale in two weeks.

At the end of the show, voting opens for the first time this season. America will get to vote to send one of the non-selected artists from tonight to also make the Live Finale, so three artists total from tonight will make the Voice Finale!

Aaron is definitely missing his family during this process. This is also Reba's Mic Drop selection. For this performance, he is singing “Beer Never Broke My Heart” by Luke Combs. He said it's a fun, upbeat song, and he wants to show that before the finale.

Aaron is definitely country. He has such a strong voice. It works well on this song, and he got the crowd behind him.

Coaches' Feedback: Snoop said he performs like a superstar. You can't lose with him. Reba said he did wonderful in rehearsal, but this is the cherry on top.

Michael said she is the best vocalist that he's ever seen on “The Voice. For this performance, she is singing “Don't Stop Believin'” by Journey. She said she chose this song, as it is the anthem to her life, and never stop believing. 

Oh my, Jazz did her thing on this song. This is a song everyone knows. However, she put her own twist on it. Those notes she was hitting were crazy. This was a stellar performance.

Coaches' Feedback: Niall said there is zero she can't do. She is a ridiculous singer, and she deserves to be in the finale. Michael said he got goosebumps; that was amazing.

This rocker is the Carson Callback. For the Playoffs, he is singing “Undressed” by Sombr. He is hoping to go from almost being sent home to the Finale.

He has a low-key voice. It's just subtle, but it works for this song. It's a cool tune, and I think he sounds good on it. He hits a long, big note towards the end. Ryan has a good vibe, and it works with this song.

Coaches' Feedback: Niall said it felt like we were at his show. Reba said he keeps giving more, and she loves what he's bringing to the show.

Michael said she can sing any genre. Reba tried to steal her from Team Bublé. For the Playoffs, Trinity said she can dive into a different side: rock. She is singing “Barracuda” by Heart.

Yes, this is a different side for her. She has a very strong voice. However, this song choice doesn't work for me. I think she could shine on something else, and this just fell flat for me.

Coaches' Feedback: Snoop said she was up there rocking out, and she just moved up in my book. Michael said she is so quiet in real life, but she has so much confidence as an artist. She has all the elements it takes to be a real star.

Aubrey is another one-chair turn. Niall said she is a black horse in this competition. For the Playoffs, Aubrey will be singing “Black Velvet” by Alannah Myles. Reba said this is not a sweet song she has been singing, so she needs to bring the attitude.

She has that country twang to her, and it works on this song. Her voice is so pure, and it has this sound to it that is appealing. Such a good tone, and I am a fan.

Coaches' Feedback: Niall said those last two performances by her deserve a spot in the finale. She is special. Reba said she loves the song, and she stepped out on this stage, and she owned it. She sang her butt off, and she has great stage appeal. She is the complete package.

Rob auditioned for “The Voice” during season 25, but got no chairs to turn around. Now, here he is, just one step away from the Voice Finale. For the Playoffs, he is singing “I Hope You Dance” by Lee Ann Womack.

I feel Rob has a very good voice. He seems like a very seasoned singer, but this song choice is just mellow to me. It starts too slowly for me. He finally kicks in right towards the end, and hits a big note, and it works for me. You can feel the emotion at the end.

Coaches' Feedback: Reba said it touched her heart. He took that song and made it better. Snoop said he is sweet on him and would take him into the studio and record with him.

Reba said Peyton is his chamillione, and she is surprised by him every time he takes the stage. Before this, he was gigging full-time and singing on small stages; now he is so close to the Voice Finale. For the Playoffs, he is singing “Hold Back the River” by James Bay.

You want a person to have that something. Something in their voice that just stands out, makes you feel something. I feel like Peyton has that. His voice is unique, and I enjoy listening to him sing.

Coaches' Feedback: Snoop said he would be smokin' and vibin' to his music. Reba said he is so proud of him, and everyone around the world can see how good he is.

Michael said Max is his 14-year-old phenom. Max was Michael's Mic Drop pick also. For this Playoff, he will be singing “A Change Is Gonna Come” by Sam Cooke. He said he is going to sing it for his family and for the world.

It's just amazing how he is only 14 years old. His voice is so strong and old school. He is so confident on that stage for someone in high school! Max is a winner, and this is going to be a tough one for Michael.

Coaches' Feedback: Snoop said Michael, that is the winner of “The Voice.” Michael said he can be so quiet, but he steps up, and people listen. He could not have asked for him to be better.

Reba and Michael had time to make their decision. Here are the results and who they picked to move on to the Voice Finale in two weeks:

Now it is time for America to vote. You can go here to vote for one of the following artists to move on to the Voice Finale. Voting is open until 7:00 a.m. ET on December 2:

Only one of those six artists can make it through to the finale. Who are you voting for?

Voting for Aaron or Payton.
The two judges did not pick the best singers to be finalists tonight! Hope the audiance makes a better choice!

I've liked Aaron from the beginning, but last night was not his best performance. I liked Peyton and Ryan.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","The Latest Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton Romance Update","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-still-together-married/","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 16:05:45 GMT","

Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton kept their holiday low-key at home and shared a sweet moment with fans. On November 28, Stefani posted an Instagram Stories photo of Shelton kissing her on the cheek as she smiled in a flannel.

There was no caption or explanation, but the picture gave a quiet update on where things stand for the former coaches on “The Voice.” It was a relaxed look at their post-Thanksgiving weekend and a reminder that they're spending the season together.

A source told E! News that the couple planned to spend the holidays in Oklahoma with their family, keeping things “lowkey” after a busy year of music, TV projects, and business ventures.

Stefani and Shelton, who married in 2021, have been laying low in recent weeks. According to E! News, the couple skipped the Country Music Awards on November 19, with an insider sharing that they would be “watching the CMAs on their TV this year” instead of attending in person.

The decision aligns with how Shelton has described their life in Oklahoma. In a 2023 interview with E! News, he shared that their Southern property has helped Stefani tap into a new side of herself.

“I'm not going to say that she's become this country girl, but I just think we're starting to see a different side of Gwen,” Shelton said.

Stefani has echoed that sentiment. Speaking to The Guardian in 2023, she explained that their shared time on the land—especially during the pandemic—became a meaningful part of their relationship.

“I know this sounds weird, but Blake and I came together in gardening,” Stefani said. “We have a house together in Oklahoma, and during the pandemic, we came across this very old building on the land, and there were some purple irises, which someone must have planted centuries ago, but they've survived.”

She added that meeting Shelton after her divorce from Gavin Rossdale felt transformative. “Meeting my husband felt like a second chance at life,” she said. “Because when my family fell apart, it felt like a catastrophe. How do you pick yourself up from that? But God put this other person there to love me.”

Shelton has also spoken about their holiday traditions in Oklahoma. In a 2023 interview with People, he joked that the house has one major Thanksgiving rule: “Never say no to any kind of food.” He said he likes to experiment with “whatever weird one we come up with,” while Stefani handles the more traditional recipes. “We go all out for Thanksgiving,” he added. “We've got a huge family, so we feel good about making a bunch of food.”

While Shelton officially stepped away from his full-time role on “The Voice” after season 23, he has not disappeared from the show's orbit. In an April 2024 interview with E! News, he explained that his exit felt like the right move.

“I did 23 seasons of the show and I enjoyed it,” he said. “And by the time I got to that last season, it was time.”

Shelton said he wanted to refocus on his country career. “I needed to get back to what my day job was anyway,” he explained. “Which is, you know, being a country singer.” He added that while he still feels close to the “Voice” family, he does not see himself returning as a full-time coach: “As far as the job goes, I don't think I'm ever ready to do that again as I sit here now.”

Even so, Shelton popped up in a playful way during a recent episode of “The Voice” season 28. When Michael Bublé joked about chasing a three-peat as a winning coach, Niall Horan responded by playing an audio clip of Shelton saying, “I don't give a crap about a three-peat.”

The moment sent the audience and coaches into laughter. Horan looked up and joked, “My father! Is that you?” before replaying the clip and adding, “I miss you dad. I know you're back there in Oklahoma, harvesting some fields or something.”

For fans, it was a reminder that even if Shelton is spending more time at home with Stefani and their blended family, his presence still looms large over the “Voice” stage—and his romance with Stefani remains firmly in the spotlight, even when they keep things quiet.

New episodes of “The Voice” season 28 air Mondays and Tuesdays at 8/7c on NBC, with episodes available to stream the next day on Peacock.

Michael Bublé is a four-time Grammy winner and longtime “The Voice” coach, but his most important role is dad. The singer and his wife, Argentine actress Luisana Lopilato, share four kids and have been married since 2011. Their love story started overseas, grew through music, and became the foundation of a very close family. Here's what you need to know.

Bublé and Lopilato first crossed paths in Buenos Aires in 2008, not long after Bublé's breakup with actress Emily Blunt.

Lopilato was already a household name in Argentina thanks to her role in “Rebelde Way” and her pop-rock group Erreway.

Bublé has said he was instantly taken with her and even wrote his hit “Haven't Met You Yet” about their relationship. She starred in the video before they were officially a couple.

They were engaged by 2009 and married twice in 2011—first in Argentina and then again in Canada.

Noah was born in 2013 and instantly changed Bublé's world. When he was diagnosed with cancer at age 3, the family put work on hold. After 18 months of treatment, Noah went into remission, per People. Bublé later said the experience reshaped everything in his life and made him see success and family differently.

Now 12, Noah is thriving and has even taken an interest in music. Bublé once shared a video of him playing piano and joked, “He has more talent in his little fingers than I have in my whole body.”

Elias was born in 2016 and is known in the family for his love of Marvel characters. Bublé once shared a birthday picture of him dressed as Captain America.

In a visit to “The View,” Bublé shared the story of telling the kids they were expecting a new baby. Elias wanted to know why he wasn't invited when “We told them, ‘You know, Mommy has a baby in her tummy and you're gonna have a little brother or sister,' and my 5-year-old Eli was just distraught,” the singer recalled. “And we said, ‘What's wrong?' and he said, ‘Why didn't you invite us to watch when you fell in love and made the baby?' “

Vida arrived in 2018. Her name means “life,” and she was named partly after both grandmothers. Bublé has shared videos of dance classes, Marvel debates, and their father-daughter routines. He once joked her first words were practically: “I am inevitable.”

Cielo was born in 2022, and Bublé has said this pregnancy was special because it would “probably be the last.” She was introduced in his music video for “I'll Never Not Love You,” where Lopilato appeared pregnant in the final scene.

Catch Michael Bublé Monday and Tuesday nights on “The Voice.”

The past decade of Hollywood horror has been dominated by names like Jordan Peele and Zach Cregger, creators who pivoted from short-form comedy careers to find massive success in genre filmmaking. In 2026, horror fans might be adding another name to that list: Curry Barker. 

Best known as one half of the “That's a Bad Idea” YouTube channel and as the director of the viral $800 short film “Milk & Serial,” Barker made his feature directorial debut with “Obsession,” a contemporary riff on a classic monkey's paw horror setup that became one of the breakout hits of the fall festival season. And a new teaser trailer offers a hint at what's in store when it opens in theaters next spring.

Written and directed by Barker, “Obsession” stars Michael Johnston as a romantically unsuccessful young man who asks a vintage wish-granting toy to make his crush (Inde Navarrette) become obsessed with him. The rest of the cast includes Cooper Tomlinson, Megan Lawless, and Andy Richter. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“Obsession” premiered in the Midnight Madness section of the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival, before making prestigious stops on the genre festival circuit like Fantastic Fest and Sitges. The film earned rave reviews from the start, prompting Focus Features to acquire it in the kind of buzzy festival deal that gets rarer and rarer with each passing year. Jason Blum also boarded the project as an executive producer through Blumhouse — arguably the biggest endorsement a new horror filmmaker can receive. 

“'Obsession' begins with the simplest of horror premises,” IndieWire's TIFF review read. “Bear is a shy and sensitive music store employee who can't find the courage to ask his co-worker and childhood friend Nikki on a date. Rather than be honest with her and tell her how he actually feels, he wanders into a woo-woo crystal store and buys a One Wish Willow, a kitschy antique toy from the 1960s that promises to grant its owner one wish when they snap a branch in half. The cashier warns him that most of the customers who buy them have complained about the results, but it wouldn't be much of a horror movie if he listened.”A Focus Features release, “Obsession” opens in theaters on May 15, 2026. Watch the film's first teaser trailer below.

More than two years after David Lowery's new feature, “Mother Mary,” was announced, even the people involved in the film don't quite seem to know how to talk about it. But one thing that's resoundingly clear is that the hotly anticipated A24 title — which has been described as a “weird, weird film” by the “Peter Pan and Wendy” director and “transformative” by its cast — is going to be a wild ride. 

“Mother Mary” stars Anne Hathaway as a seething pop singer who becomes embroiled in a psychosexual affair with an old friend and fashion designer, played by “I May Destroy You” multi-hyphenate Michaela Coel. The trailer, which dropped Tuesday, gives audiences their first real taste of the twisted relationship between Mary (Hathaway) and Sam (Coel), who are brought back into each other's orbit by the pop singer's need for a dress that will breathe life into her comeback tour.

After being reunited, the estranged friends spend most of the film shacked up in a 13th-century barn that acts as Sam's atelier — trading violent looks over chiseled cheekbones and conjuring up old demons. As the dress comes together with the help of Sam's stone-faced assistant (Hunter Schafer), and seances are performed, a soundtrack featuring original songs by Charli XCX, Jack Antonoff, and FKA Twigs plays in the background, making for an “epic pop melodrama” with an occult flair.

 










Leading up to the trailer's release, most of what's been known about “Mother Mary” has come from its stars, who've primarily spoken about the challenging and intense experience of making it — which Lowery, for his part, has compared to shooting “Apocalypse Now.” Speaking with Vogue, Hathaway described how the film was an exercise in relinquishing control, both because she had to ad-lib the onscreen singing scenes and because she had to abandon her polished approach to performing and surrender herself to the material. 

“I had to submit to being a beginner,” she said. “The humility of that — showing up every day knowing you're going to suck. And it has to be OK. You're not ‘bad.' You're just a beginner. Getting to that mindset — I had to shed some things that were hard to shed. It was welcome. But it was hard, the way transformational experiences can be hard.” 

During a red carpet interview with IndieWire, Schafer, who makes for a haunting fashion girlie, emphasized the pleasurable aspect of the experience while still echoing her co-star's sentiments. “It was a lot of fun, and I think people are going to be mind-blown,” the “Euphoria” actor, who recently celebrated the release of “The Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,” said. “I was mind-blown.” 

 










Although as writer, director, and editor, Lowery — whose other film credits include “The Green Knight” and “The Old Man and the Gun” — was fully in control of the film, he also seems to have been disoriented by the experience. During a conversation at last year's Melbourne International Film Festival, where he spoke about taking a break from adapting stories to focus on original material, the director sounded as if he was compelled to make “Mother Mary” almost against his will. 

“I wrote the first 20 pages when I was shooting ‘Peter Pan and Wendy' and it's been percolating ever since,” Lowery said. “That movie was huge, it was one of the greatest shoots of my life and one of the hardest edits of my life and it inspired a lot of soul-searching. After that, I decided I'm just going to do something simple. I need to do a movie with just two actors in a room having a long heart-to-heart … a really gentle filmmaking experience.

“But then I thought, ‘What if one of those characters is a pop star? And what if we started at a stadium?' Then, it got bigger,” he continued. “And again, it wound up being the hardest thing I've ever done.” 

“Mother Mary” will release in April 2026 from A24. Watch the trailer below.

If it's the first Monday in December (and the first day back after the Thanksgiving holiday, ouch), most of the NYC film world can be found at the Gotham Film Awards, back in its traditional venue at Cipriani Wall Street. The ceremony is typically viewed as the first big live awards show of the season, and offers a glitzy entry into the weeks (and months!) to come. As ever, IndieWire was in the room for this year's event, and watched a pretty thrilling evening unfold.

This year's nominees were led by Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another,” which picked up six nominations, but only walked away with one: the night's crown jewel, Best Feature.

Despite an influx of tributes for other films from the studio and streaming world, including “After the Hunt,” “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,” “Song Sung Blue,” “Frankenstein,” “Sinners,” “Hedda,” and “Jay Kelly,” it was comparatively smaller films that made off with some of the night's biggest wins. That included three wins for Jafar Panahi and his “It Was Just an Accident,” plus trophies for “My Father's Shadow,” “Pillion,” and more.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






For the first time in its history, this year's batch of Gotham nominees included 10 Best Feature picks. In previous years, the category only included five nominees, but the category was expanded for the 2025 season to include up to 10 nominees. While Anderson's film was nominated in that category (and much was made of its studio bonafides), the other nine picks represented a strong array of indie offerings, including titles like “East of Wall,” “Lurker,” and “Familiar Touch,” alongside heavy-hitters like “Hamnet” and “Train Dreams.”

Nominees are chosen by committees of film critics, journalists, festival programmers, and film curators. Separate juries of writers, directors, actors, producers, editors, and other film industry professionals will determine the final Gothams recipients. (This year's nominating committees included myself and Chief Film Critic David Ehrlich.)

December 2, 2025

There are moments when THE LIFE OF ERG, a vibrant tape credited to a Dominican American trio from Lynn, Massachusetts, threatens to spin off its axis. “Bilderberg” begins promisingly enough, with frontman Erg One rapping calmly about favelas and Ronald Reagan over a modest drum loop; producer BoneWeso cues up a swirling violin synth. Estee Nack punches in for the hook, crooning like a gravel-voiced lounge singer, ad-libbing over his own vocal track. The instrumental drifts into the second verse, urgent horns disturbing the tranquility, rhymes drowned out in a clash of drums and street noise. It's over as soon as it arrives—the loop resets, and we're back in our lounge chairs.

These combustions add depth to Erg's landscapes, less a matter of competing visions than merging interpretations. His verses are enlivened by assured wisecracks (“Money in my hand, that bitch was a palm reader/When I asked for my flowers, they gave me an arboretum”) and tropical climes, destinations selected for unspoken business purposes. A scene veteran of two decades, Nack assumes a supervisory role, chiming in with hooks and rambling verses. The format instills balance between psychedelia and pragmatism—Erg the straight man, Nack the bellowing wild card, seasoned professionals who've lived to tell the tale.

Although compelling on its own, the intricacy warrants context. Nack cut his teeth with Tragic Allies, an operatic Lynn outfit indebted to Queensbridge lyricists Prodigy and Tragedy Khadafi. In that lineup he was kinetic and chameleonic, reciting Five Percent precepts with metronomic precision, piping choruses in melodic patois. He resurfaced, unrecognizable, in the late 2010s with variations on Roc Marciano and Westside Gunn's neoclassical raps. The whittled samples and slowed-down tempos revealed a wild-eyed preacher, allowing Nack to toy with East Coast conventions—bars veering between English and Spanish, loosely patterned rhymes landing a half-beat behind the snare.

After a stint on Gunn's Griselda Records—a nice look that reduced him to a supporting act—Nack continued tacking left with instinctive performances over deconstructed arrangements, often working in miniature. He maximizes his limited screentime on THE LIFE OF ERG, flexing a wizened, expressive flamboyance, transcending the fully-loaded bars of his Tragic Allies days. “14hrflights” finds him in conversation with himself, peppering open space with interstitial ad libs (his preferred ad lib, quixotically, is “ad lib”). He deploys an incremental technique on “Nevatrustazing,” embellishing and compounding the thesis with each sequential bar. He's always coloring outside the lines, pausing for breath where he pleases; when the couplets rhyme at all, it's usually via some slanted internal scheme.

BoneWeso spent the 2000s working in dancehall and reggaeton spaces, but you'd never know it based on THE LIFE OF ERG. His single-tracked loops are more evocative than Daringer and Nicholas Craven's, less frenetic than Conductor Williams and Don Carrera's. Erg takes cues from the instrumentals, indulging nostalgia over a dreamy sax on “Wareztheluv,” conjuring Parisian flights and top-shelf liquor on “Silenceofthelambs.” The stylistic touchstones—aspirational lifestyle raps, sampling technique, newsreels recounting drug busts and art heists—are formalities of second- or third-wave neoclassicism. What's engrossing is the trio's divergence from canon, the local idiosyncrasies and equatorial intrigue. A subtle immersion takes place; it's natural, for instance, when Nack rhymes “Tahoe” with “abajo” on “Intervention.” As in Mach-Hommy's work, the colliding dialects speak to an unlikely diaspora, secret or alternate histories of would-be Escobars in New England's rust belt.

These adaptations bestow a rich specificity, distinctive performers bending a pre-existing format for their purposes. What's difficult about the work, broadly, is a sense of contraction. There's no infrastructure for this stuff anymore; in lieu of label investment, working artists churn out project after self-released project. The environment promotes novelty, but also imposes a ceiling—the tightly plotted sagas of Mobb Deep and Capone-N-Noreaga have given way to thin margins, low stakes, narratives that never really go anywhere. Among a tidal wave of off-brand Griselda, Nack and Erg are small-city kingpins reveling in limited resources, splurging on sneakers rather than sports cars, middle-aged and flyer than they've ever been.

Genre:

Pop/R&B

December 2, 2025

Aya Nakamura spent the years following her 2023 album DNK embroiled in national drama that had little to do with her music. The mere suggestion that the French Malian singer might perform at the 2024 Paris Olympics ignited an ugly backlash, fueling a racist opposition campaign and a pearl-clutching debate over who ought to represent France on its biggest international stage. Nakamura sang anyway, reminding the world why she remains one of the most popular Francophone singers working today.

Destinée, her fifth album, meets the furor by leaning even harder into a sound only she can deliver. The production returns to her familiar melange of Afrobeats, zouk, pop, and R&B; features from Joé Dwèt Filé, JayO, and others add ripples of kompa, reggae, and Latin neo-soul. At 30, Nakamura sounds steelier, almost amused by her critics. In her writing, she doubles down on her signature braid of Parisian argot (slang) and Bambara, a wink to her fans and a cheeky taunt to the institutions that would prefer a more demure entertainer.

If Nakamura's third album, AYA, was “the sound of a young woman and mother who has found the love she deserves,” Destinée is that of a woman scorned. These love songs are pressure cookers, simmering with threats and accusations. Some play coy, like “Alien,” where she boasts about being insatiable, or the airy Kali Uchis collab “Baby boy,” where flirtation doubles as a power play. But on “Dis-moi,” Nakamura wonders if she's sleeping beside the devil, and Jamaican star Shenseea's warning lands like a line from a thriller: “I'll hurt you if you hurt me.”

Most compelling is how Destinée reframes Nakamura's public narrative without stooping. She doesn't sermonize about her right to belong; she treats those arguments as beneath her. Lovers, haters, and the establishment blur into a composite antagonist, a symbol of everyone who has tried to shrink her. “Blues,” a stripped-down ballad that recalls the intimacy of “Fly,” is Nakamura at her most vulnerable, voice cracking against soft keys and a heartbeat. But running beneath the album's flexes and dismissals is a deeper inquiry into power: how it's gained, lost, reclaimed, sometimes shared. She doesn't directly address the spectacle surrounding her Olympic appearance or her legal issues with her ex, but when she murmurs about numbing emotions and burying bad memories on opener “Anesthésie,” it's an easy connection to make.

For all its confidence, Destinée can rely too heavily on familiar formulas. The album stretches to 18 tracks, and many settle into a similar midtempo sway, with percussion so uniform it begins to feel automated. The hooks are sticky but predictable—you'll crave a wild solo or switch-up to jolt the hypnotic groove. Still, Nakamura stands 10 toes down in her dualities: tender and ruthless, glamorous and tired, wounded and unbothered. Destinée distills the playfulness, poise, and melodic grace that have made her a generational pop star, and with this album, she invites us to revel in the fact that she's still here.

A24 has released the trailer for Mother Mary, a new film from writer and director David Lowery featuring original music by Jack Antonoff, Charli XCX, and FKA twigs. The clip introduces the pop star Mother Mary (played by Anne Hathaway) as she navigates a reunion with her former costume designer Sam Anselm (portayed by Michaela Coel). Watch the trailer below.

Antonoff, Charli XCX, and FKA twigs wrote and produced music for Mother Mary. The songs are performed in the film by Hathaway. FKA twigs also acts in Mother Mary, as do Hunter Schafer, Atheena Frizzell, Kaia Gerber, Jessica Brown Findlay, Alba Baptista, Isaura Barbé-Brown, and Sian Clifford.

This isn't the first or the last time Charli XCX has written music for an A24 film. “Hot Girl,” which she wrote with the 1975's George Daniel, appeared in the production company's 2022 murder mystery Bodies Bodies Bodies. Last month, Charli XCX shared the first teaser trailer for The Moment, the Aidan Zamiri–directed A24 movie that stars and was conceived by the pop star while touring behind Brat. (Charli XCX explained that “the seed of the idea was conceived from this idea of being pressured to make [a tour documentary]. It's fiction, but it's the realest depiction of the music industry that I've ever seen.”)

But, wait, there's more! Charli XCX recently announced her Wuthering Heights album that accompanies Emerald Fennell's upcoming film of the same name and released her John Cale collaboration “House” from that record. Plus, she's also involved in Gregg Araki's upcoming drama I Want Your Sex, a remake of the 1978 mondo horror film Faces of Death, and a Romain Gavras movie called Sacrifice that also stars Yung Lean.

	Former Full House star Dave Coulier is undergoing treatment for tongue cancer just under a year after beating non-Hodgkin lymphoma.


	Coulier revealed that he's now battling HPV-related oropharyngeal tongue cancer in a new interview with Today. “To go through chemotherapy and feel that relief of whoa, it's gone, and then to get a test that says, well, now you've got another kind of cancer … it is a shock to the system,” Coulier said.


	Oropharyngeal tongue cancer forms in the middle section of the throat, known as the oropharynx, per the American Cancer Society. The oropharynx includes parts of the tongue, the back part of the roof of the mouth, and the tonsils, all of which help with breathing, eating, swallowing, and talking. Saliva is produced in the oropharynx, too.


	Coulier said his doctors first noticed the new cancer during a routine PET scan check-up after he'd completed chemotherapy for his non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The comedian said something “flared on the scan” at the base of his tongue, so a biopsy was performed.

	“It was very painful. It's like if you bit your tongue, but the pain just lasted every single day,” Coulier said.


	While the initial biopsy didn't show signs of cancer, the same spot had grown when Coulier returned for his next PET scan. Coulier went to an ear, nose, and throat oncologist for more testing, and after a CT scan, an MRI, and a second biopsy to remove an even larger part of his tongue, the results came back positive for cancer cells. 

	











	“[The doctors] said it's totally unrelated to my non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This is a new cancer,” Coulier recalled. “I said, ‘Are you kidding me?'”


	Coulier's doctors told him the cancer could've stemmed from a long-dormant HPV virus that “activated and turned into a carcinoma.” But luckily, the comedian added, his doctors found the cancer early enough that was considered “very treatable.”


	“It's got a 90 percent curability rate,” Coulier said. “The doctor said the prognosis is good, but we're going to start radiation immediately.”

	Coulier said his radiation treatments are less “aggressive” than chemo, there are still “side effects” like nausea and brain fog; he's also still contending with some residual pain from the biopsies. But Coulier and his doctors expect the cancer to be gone by the time he finishes radiation at the end of the year. 


	“My joke usually is … I'm doing really well for a guy with cancer,” Coulier quipped.

Z
iz Lasota and Gwen Danielson had reached a stalemate. It was nighttime on the Caleb, the ancient steel-hulled tugboat where they had spent the last five months of 2017, anchored in the outer harbor of Pillar Point, 25 miles south of San Francisco. With their high cheekbones, dimpled chins, and penetrating gazes, the pair looked enough like siblings that strangers sometimes commented on their resemblance, but each could barely see the other in the pitch black that night, sitting on the floor of the boat's cramped control room.


	By her own account, Lasota was angry. Speaking into the dark, she remembers warning Danielson that “I would not at any point back down, and if [that] meant we were consigned to a runaway positive feedback loop of revenge, so be it … we might as well try to kill each other right then and there.” Then Lasota — who, at six foot two, stood five inches taller than Danielson — rose to her feet, silent, waiting for Danielson's reply.


	The rift in their relationship had started over money: It had cost more than expected to buy, fix up, and maintain the fleet of boats on which they hoped to eventually house a gang of brilliant programmers devoted to saving the world from an AI-engineered apocalypse.

	On top of the upfront costs, they were paying berthing fees for three boats, not including the Caleb. Anchoring their tugboat in the outer harbor, where there was no fee, was meant to give them breathing room, but instead it teed up expensive clashes with the United States Coast Guard (who believed their boat, loaded with thousands of gallons of diesel fuel, posed a threat to the environment), and a nearby fuel dock operator (who accused them of illegally accessing his equipment in the middle of the night to pump contaminated bilge water off the boat). After they were discovered doing that, they were ordered to hire a tanker truck to remove any remaining “hazardous fluids” from the tug. (Lasota did not respond to interview requests, and lawyers representing her in pending criminal cases declined to comment for this story. Accounts of these events are drawn from Lasota's and Danielson's blogs, relevant court documents, and interviews.)

	The pair eventually became so desperate for money that they even, against their convictions as devout vegans, registered the Caleb for the purposes of ferrying crabbers out to sea to drop their traps for cash — a period Lasota referred to on her blog as “our attempt to be brutal consequentialists.”


	When Danielson first pitched Lasota on the idea of bringing other similarly brainy, ambitious, cash-poor members of the Bay Area's Rationalist community together to live on boats, it felt like a revelation. Both had moved to the notoriously expensive enclave to be part of an elite intellectual community that considered itself the last best hope to save humanity from total annihilation by superhuman artificial intelligence. By living on the water, they figured they could stay close to that community, without slaving away at a soul-sucking corporate tech job just to afford rent. 


	Danielson, who is bigender, was already living on a 30-foot Bermuda Sloop called the Islander when they met Lasota. Both navigating the early stages of their respective gender transitions, the pair bonded instantly, and Lasota was captivated with Danielson's vision for a “Rationalist Fleet.” “Maybe following Gwen's crazy idea would be an answer to the problem where whatever I expect to try, I just expected it will be too slow for me to save the world,” Lasota wrote on her blog.


	Together, with a third Rationalist, they toured a series of boats of varying levels of seaworthiness: a moldy motorboat for $1,000, a liveaboard “with no working motor but a pretty decent interior” hawked by a guy with a swastika tattoo, a Coast Guard Cutter turned fishing vessel named Pacific Hunter, and a sailboat with cabins for six called The Rapture. (“I joked if we bought it we could refresh that paint, then cross it out, and write, ‘The Singularity,'” Lasota later wrote, referring to the hypothetical point at which artificial intelligence will outstrip human intelligence, and become self-improving — an event, some believe, which will quickly lead to human extinction.)

	In the end, they opted for a decommissioned Navy tugboat called the Caleb. With the help of a motley crew recruited via a Rationalist mailing list, in July 2017, they piloted the Caleb down the West Coast. Pillar Point wasn't supposed to be their final destination — Lasota and Danielson planned to head toward Benicia or somewhere along the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to start their housing project in earnest. But, under increasing financial pressure, and after a dispute with the boat's co-owner, they stopped at Pillar Point to think through their next steps. 

	











	Living without the burden of rent (on land, at least) was supposed to give Lasota and Danielson more time to devote to AI safety, but instead, in the months that followed, any time not consumed by boat crises, they spent talking — refining each other's speculative theories about the brain and the laws of the universe — and beginning to question whether the community they'd poured so much effort into was made up of the kind of people they once believed it to be.


	Later, Lasota and Danielson's disappointment would extend beyond the Rationalist community to two of its most hallowed institutions — the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) and the Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR). They would become increasingly disillusioned with both before stumbling upon information that torched any remaining faith they'd placed in either organization.


	But none of that had happened yet, the night on the Caleb, as Lasota towered over Danielson, challenging her closest friend to a fight to the death. In Lasota's mind, their disagreement was about more than just money. At one time, Danielson had been unanimously declared “dictator” of the Rationalist Fleet, but Lasota was starting to feel like she was spending all of her time talking Danielson through “mental upgrades,” and all of her resources fixing problems Danielson got them into.


	The challenge she issued that night was grounded in a theory she had begun refining on the boat. Lasota called it a “Timeless Gambit,” and she explained it as a way to shape shared “expectations in potential outcomes” — computations that “exist in multiple people's heads, and multiple places in time.” The underlying idea is that each decision you make does not just affect your immediate, physical future, it determines how others will treat you in all predictions, simulations, and parallel versions of that situation. If, for example, Danielson knew their actions would lead to Lasota escalating dramatically — challenging them to a fight to the death — another version of Danielson might have treated Lasota differently in the lead-up to their fight. In the years that followed, observers would come to recognize the contours of her theory in the baffling logic that accompanied a series of violent encounters around the country.


	On the Caleb, Lasota's gambit worked: Danielson stayed on the floor, assuring Lasota that they were not a threat and telling her that they would “rather be my number two than fight.” There was no altercation — no violence at all — only, according to Lasota, a quiet reshuffling of the dynamics of their relationship. 

	











	But their quarrel that night would have another downstream effect: Lasota's account of the dispute, memorialized on her blog, Sinceriously, was offered years later as evidence she was dangerous and should be cast out of the Rationalist community. “Ziz has taken more than one action that had a reasonable probability of causing fear of physical violence in those around her,” CFAR's president, Anna Salamon, wrote on Facebook, using the boat story as an example. Danielson argued that the scene was misused and misinterpreted, by Salamon and others, in an effort to portray Danielson as a victim of Ziz's abuse — a characterization Danielson strongly rejected.


	By that point, two years after the fight, some members of the community were becoming disconcerted by Lasota. Her presence, her writing, the way she dressed — in all black, often in long robes — made them uneasy. The final straw came in late 2019, after Lasota, Danielson, and two others were arrested while staging a protest at a reunion for alumni of CFAR's self-help workshops.


	Of those four protesters, today, one is dead, another is awaiting trial for her murder, a third disappeared, and the fourth — Lasota — is languishing in a county jail in Maryland, awaiting trial on unrelated charges. 


	At least five others who entered Lasota's orbit in the years that followed the protest are also dead or in jail: Two are accused of separate murders on opposite sides of the country, and two are persons of interest in a double homicide in Pennsylvania. Earlier this year, a fifth died in a shootout with the U.S. Border Patrol. As for the Caleb, it is rotting, half-sunk in the outer harbor at Pillar Point, abandoned, along with the dream of a Rationalist Fleet, years ago.


	TODAY, MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE FAMILIAR with the Rationalist community probably associate it with a handful of online spaces, the most prominent of which is LessWrong, a forum for people curious about cognitive bias and Bayesian reasoning, the practice of assigning mathematical probabilities to possible outcomes. It's the kind of place where one can find other people interested in the Paperclip Problem — the idea that a superhuman AI could be given a simple task like “maximize paper clip production” and end up destroying the world — or argue with effective altruists about “shrimp welfare,” the idea that shrimp are “moral patients” whose pain and suffering everyone should care about much more.

	











	But the online forum began with a much more specific mission: In 2003, a young Eliezer Yudkowsky was dreaming up an ambitious plan to recruit an army of individuals who would devote themselves to stopping superhuman AI from destroying its human creators.


	“I think I may have to split my attention one more time, hopefully the last, and write something to attract the people we need. My current thought is a book on the underlying theory and specific human practice of rationality… I don't think we'll find the people we need by posting a job opening. Movements often start around books; we don't have our book yet,” he wrote in an email to a Silicon Valley listserv.


	Yudkowsky, an autodidact who dropped out of school in the eighth grade, had been captivated by the idea of the Singularity since he first ran across the concept as a teen reading sci-fi author Vernor Vinge's short story collection True Names and Other Dangers. By age 21, he had co-founded the nonprofit Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence, or SIAI. Yudkowsky, the institute's sole employee, was determined to build machine superintelligence himself — before eventually recognizing all the ways that could go wrong and devoting himself to AI alignment (working to ensure that artificial intelligence shares humans' values and priorities) instead.


	“It was obviously the most important thing going on,” Yudkowsky explained to Rolling Stone in 2023, “and the things that would, like, determine the fate of the galaxy and all that.”


	In order to succeed, Yudkowsky knew he would need a lot more people — a lot more of a certain kind of person — to join his cause. After sending that 2003 email, he set to work on a series of lengthy essays about overcoming one's own inherent cognitive biases. (The logic was simple, as one ex-Rationalist put it, “Yud tried to talk to people about AI, and they disagreed with him, and he concluded they were insane and needed to learn how to think better.”) 


	The collection was called The Sequences and it, in turn, drew people to LessWrong, the forum Yudkowsky started and would later identify as “a key venue for SIAI recruitment.” He followed The Sequences up with a second opus: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, a 660,000-word J.K. Rowling-inspired fan fiction about a young wizard whose real superpower is his cool, rational mind. Both works revolve around the same core idea: that brains are systematically irrational, but there are ways to train yours to think better.

	











	His plan worked. Droves of readers — young, brainy high achievers who wanted to make a difference in the world — read The Sequences or the Potter fan fic, and many came to Berkeley to work or volunteer at two organizations, both spun out of Yudkowsky's original think tank: The Machine Intelligence Research Institute, or MIRI, devoted to the technical research needed to develop friendly AI, and the Center for Applied Rationality, or CFAR, devoted to the broader goal of helping people become more rational so they would take the threat of artificial intelligence more seriously.


	“He spun this grand tale of adventure and great danger … Here's this great mathematical evil, and we have to beat it by being better at math — and to me, that was very seductive,” says Qiaochu Yuan, a young math prodigy and MIT graduate who moved to the Bay Area and got involved with CFAR after reading Yudkowsky. “I was like, ‘Wow, that sounds really nice. I would love to be a big-shot hero and save the world with the power of math.'”


	Lasota and Danielson were among them, too. Both dropped out of school — Danielson abandoning an academic scholarship at Rice University, Lasota leaving graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign — and moved to the Bay Area convinced by Yudkowsky's argument the Singularity was coming, that it would almost certainly spell doom for life on Earth, and that the only way to stop it was if enough intellectually-gifted individuals banded together to find a solution in time.


	LASOTA GREW UP THE ELDEST OF THREE children in a house in the woods outside Fairbanks, Alaska. Her father, Dan, had been a physics and astronomy major at the University of Rochester where he worked at the university's Mees Observatory. Her mother, Kate, graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the same college with a degree in integrated sciences.


	In 1988, the fall after Kate graduated, the couple, already married, moved to Alaska, where Dan, an early computer wiz, taught Introduction to Macintosh Computers to community college students at a University of Alaska, Fairbanks campus. He went on to work in several computer systems roles for government research organizations, before starting his own database company in 1998.


	Today, Dan is an instructional designer at the University of Fairbanks, where he was described in a staff spotlight as “our go-to person for all things related to research on AI in education,” and a devotee of games like Dungeons and Dragons and Civilization 6. 

	











	All three of his children studied at the university — including Ziz, a University Honors Scholar who graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in computer science in 2013. (Dan and Kate did not respond to interview requests.)


	Ziz struggled as a child with behavioral issues that her parents, one family member tells me, seemed to attribute to boredom from not being intellectually challenged by her coursework: “They would say that the teachers in the system didn't know how to educate [her].”


	But she shared her father's interest in astronomy and video games. As a college student, she interned at NASA, where she helped design a tool to measure ejections of plasma from the sun's atmosphere, and later developed a video game of her own.


	In college, she also spent a lot of time watching videos on the internet, which she later described on her blog as “hour for hour, one of the most valuable things I've ever done.” At first it was videos of evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins or the author Christopher Hitchens in debates about atheism. She went on to mainline philosophy vlogs, becoming obsessed with the study of ethics.


	“I wanted to know what everyone would do in the trolley problem,” Lasota wrote, referring to the famous quandary that ponders whether it is more ethical to allow the tram to remain on a collision course where it would kill five people, or to intervene, diverting the trolley to kill just one person. “This led to me becoming a vegetarian, then a vegan.” One day, she was on an online philosophy forum when she stumbled on Yudkowsky's Sequences and, in turn, “the most important problem in the world”: the Singularity. Still a college student, she began donating to MIRI, convinced that “our survival, the survival of sentient life, depends on it.” 


	By 2016, the year Lasota and Danielson arrived in the Bay Area, a vibrant community had taken root in the East Bay, where Rationalists lived in group houses and interrogated each other's patterns of thinking at CFAR workshops and weekly LessWrong meetups. There were parties and cuddle puddles — yes, piles of cuddling humans — and a wealth of people who had been conditioned to apply Bayesian principles to every decision they made. 


	The community also had a surprisingly high proportion of members who identify as trans or gender fluid. There is no consensus on why that is. According to a recent LessWrong community survey, the number of respondents who considered themselves trans, nonbinary, or otherwise gender nonconforming more than doubled the number of cis-women. (Cis-men vastly outnumber both, making up roughly 80 percent of respondents.) Some speculate that Rationalists, obsessed with correcting their own cognitive biases, might be more open-minded about gender identity than the general population; others suggested a shared interest in transhumanism — harnessing technology to extend life and enhance the corporeal experience — could be a factor.

	











	In many ways, the scene that greeted them when they arrived in the Bay Area didn't match their expectations. Danielson wrote on their blog about being disappointed in meeting so many people who had also read Yudkowsky's writing, but who had not come away with the same sense of purpose they had. 


	After a board game night hosted by the South Bay LessWrong chapter, they wrote: “There wasn't anybody besides me who didn't want to play board games but wanted to discuss strategy for saving the world, or rationality tech development, or AI alignment research … Where are the people working on saving the world? How/why are these people orienting towards these bizarre topics, even after reading The Sequences? Why is everyone committing slow-motion mass suicide after being told that's what's going on and info about the path out?”


	Lasota struggled, too. She had originally moved to the Bay Area determined to fulfill what she had come to believe was her destiny: scoring a lucrative tech job, then “earning to give” — donating the lion's share of her salary — to support MIRI's work. Doing so, she wrote, was “one of my main guesses about how I could best contribute to saving the world.” 


	That dream quickly ran up against the fact that she did not function well in the punishing conditions startups demanded. She writes that she was fired twice for refusing to work more than eight hours a day. Without a steady income, she borrowed from her parents and bounced between Airbnbs in increasingly far-flung corners of the Bay Area, spending her money on rideshares to rationalist meetups. It was at one of these, in Berkeley, where she met Danielson.


	They connected instantly: That night, Lasota later remembered on her blog, Danielson brought her back to their sailboat, where they showed Lasota a dragon-shaped necklace and confided that they were an otherkin — someone who identifies as nonhuman, in their case, specifically, a dragon.


	The pair became close. Lasota moved onto Danielson's boat, where they talked, Lasota wrote, “for several hours a day. About transness, about neuroscience, about their old crazy plans to save the world (breed superintelligent dogs) … About my mental tech I wrote about on my blog. About my (much cruder back then) theories of human morality.”


	For both of them, connecting with another trans person in the community felt good. Lasota had some ugly experiences after relocating to the Bay Area. At Liminal, a Rationalist group house where she briefly crashed, she wrote that after she was introduced as a non-transitioning trans woman — she took hormones, but had decided against pursuing a transition surgically or legally — one roommate “looked at me with something like disgust and asked when I'd be leaving.” At a CFAR workshop, she remembered a conversation where her interlocutor “poked at my transness, in ways that suggested they thought I was a delusional man.” At a LessWrong meetup, a man tried to convince her that she was an “autogynephile” — a straight man with a sexual fetish imaging himself as a woman.

	











	Lasota was also forced to reckon with the belief — advanced by some figures in the Rationalist movement — that transitioning was a bad idea because it would make her a less “effective” agent in the AI safety movement. She seemed to have internalized the idea that transitioning “would interfere with my ability to make money due to discrimination, and destroy too great a chunk of my tiny probability of saving the world.” She even, as Rationalists do, assigned a figure to the reduction in expected impact she would have if she did transition, pegging it at somewhere between 10 and 40 percent.


	On the boat, Lasota hashed out these frustrations and more with Danielson. By this time, she'd adopted the name Ziz (a beautiful and terrifying world destroyer from Worm, a webcomic popular with Rationalists), began wearing dark robes (a symbol of “nonsubmission”), and identifying, religiously, as a “Sith” —  rivals to the Jedi order in Star Wars. “The Sith do what they want deep down. They remove all obstructions to that and express their true values,” she wrote on her blog. (Siths, Star Wars fans may recall, also destroy their masters.)


	Danielson was struggling, too. They had, by this time, become convinced that CFAR discriminated against them on the basis of their gender identity. According to Danielson's account, they had volunteered at the first of a series of CFAR workshops in early 2017, before beginning their transition. They write that they asked to volunteer for the remaining sessions after they began presenting as female, but they were told the volunteer slots had been filled. “I was excluded from what I had been led to understand was the hiring pipeline for CFAR,” Danielson wrote. (CFAR's Anna Salamon did not respond to a request for comment.)


	In January 2019, Michael Vassar, the former president of MIRI, met with Lasota and Danielson in hopes, according to one person present, of dissuading them from suing CFAR for gender discrimination. Neither mention a potential lawsuit in any of their writings, and no suit was ever filed, but over the course of their conversation with Vassar, they learned a critical piece of information: that MIRI had reached a settlement with a former employee who had waged a protracted campaign to smear the organization as a “cult” and a ”pedophile ring.”


	The revelation shocked Lasota and Danielson to their cores. (“THEY PAID THAT FUCKER?!” Lasota remembered shouting when she heard.) She was stunned that the organization she'd placed so much faith in would use money she'd donated — the little money she and her friends had — not for time-sensitive, potentially world-saving research, but to pay off a disgruntled employee.

	











	Beyond the feeling of betrayal, there was something else that irked Lasota: the idea that an organization that staked so much of its credibility on sound decision-making would make the fundamentally unsound decision of paying what Lasota viewed as blackmail. 


	Lasota and Danielson decided to air their grievances against both CFAR and MIRI at one of the largest annual gatherings of Rationalists: the CFAR alumni reunion, scheduled to take place in November 2019 in Northern California. 


	The reunion gave attendees the chance to give presentations on any subject of their choosing. Two years earlier, in 2017, Danielson, Lasota, and Dan Powell, the other part-owner of the Caleb, had attended the reunion and given a talk about their plans for the Rationalist Fleet. This time around, Danielson explained on her blog, “I spent several weeks preparing a series of talks and discussion groups that I thought had the best chance of communicating the base information, our models, how to perceive deep aspects of their own and others' psychologies and ethics, and how to escape traps like the Bay area housing market.”


	Lasota and two other acquaintances, both transwomen in the Rationalist scene — Somni Leatham and Emma Borhanian — planned to give their own talks that were similarly critical of MIRI, CFAR, and the Rationalist community. 


	But, according to Danielson's blog, CFAR leadership interceded, telling Lasota and Danielson they were not welcome at the event after seeing a series of Discord posts by Lasota that they deemed threatening. 


	So, instead, they decided to stage a protest.


	LASOTA, DANIELSON, BORHANIAN, AND LEATHAM ARRIVED at Westminster Woods, the redwood-shaded Sonoma County retreat center where CFAR planned to hold its alumni reunion, on the afternoon of Nov. 15, 2019, shortly before the event was scheduled to begin. They wore long dark robes, according to a police report that would be filed later that day, along with black latex gloves, black silicone shoe covers, white Guy Fawkes masks, body cameras, and two-way radios.


	When deputies from the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office arrived, three protesters stood at the entrance to the retreat center, proffering leaflets. The flyers, which quoted Yudkowsky's Sequences, also declared it was time “to process what happened to MIRI, CFAR, and the rationality community. It is not what it once seemed like it would become. New things can be built.”


	The papers also criticized MIRI's decision to settle with the disgruntled employee — a decision which, in their view, made the organization “super exploitable.” Because of it, virtually anyone could “use MIRI & CFAR as their personal bank and tell them what to do instead of anticipating that they wouldn't pay out.”


	“It's easy to see this is incorrect if you are thinking with tdt” — Timeless Decision Theory — the flyer read.


	Timeless Decision Theory is a framework Yudkowsky came up with in 2010. The easiest way to explain it is through a famous thought experiment called Newcomb's Problem: an all-knowing predictor presents you with two boxes. The first box, which is transparent, has $1,000 inside, the other, which is opaque, has either $1 million or nothing. You have to decide whether to take both boxes, or only the second. The catch is: If the predictor predicts you will choose both boxes, the second box will be empty, but if it predicts you'll only choose box two, box two will contain $1 million. One school of thought — Causal Decision Theory —  says to choose both boxes because the boxes are already filled, and your decision can't change the past. With his own theory, Yudkowsky posited the opposite: If you choose box two, box two will have a $1 million, because the all-knowing predictor — armed with perfect knowledge of your decision-making — has already guessed that you are the type of person who would take box two.

	











	The idea is that your decisions don't just determine your immediate future — they also determine what copies or simulations of you would do under the same conditions across time and space. 


	MIRI, in the protesters' view, had failed this type of test: The organization would never have been “blackmailed” if it wasn't already the type of organization that could be “blackmailed” in the first place. But because it was, every assumption anyone ever made about MIRI — and its potential to save the world — needed to be reconsidered.


	The four strangely dressed figures had parked vehicles — a white Ford Econoline box truck and mini school bus — across the camp's entrances and exits. They refused to speak with retreat center staff, who called the sheriff's office, speculating that one of the protesters might have a gun. None did, but a SWAT team swarmed the camp, a bomb squad was called in, and at least one police helicopter was dispatched to the scene. The protesters were quickly and forcibly arrested; as they were being wrestled to the ground, both Lasota and Danielson screamed that they were being sexually assaulted.


	Aella, a popular Substack author and cam girl, was among those planning to attend the reunion that weekend. When she arrived and saw police lights, at first she thought there'd been a car accident, but soon news of the protest and the police response spread on group chats and email listservs, and everyone who was supposed to be arriving for the retreat ended up at a café 10 minutes down the road. 


	Aella figured it was par for the course. “This just happens,” she remembers thinking. “You just get insane people sometimes. If you're a big enough community, it's inevitable that you get a few people. And there have been a few people, besides the Zizians, who have sort of gone insane.” 


	But there was at least one person present that day to whom the protesters did not seem insane: a young Berkeley graduate named Daniel Blank, who carpooled to the retreat with other CFAR alums, and watched through the trees as deputies approached Lasota and her friends. (Neither Blank nor his lawyer responded to a request for comment.) 

	











	“He was very upset by the whole thing,” a friend who was present recalls. The protesters' allegations against MIRI and CFAR — and more so the way that everyone seemed to be shrugging them off — unnerved Blank. “He seemed confused, like, ‘How do we know they're not right?'”


	The night before, roughly 500 people — mostly alumni of past CFAR workshops, including Blank — received an email accusing CFAR and its sister organization, MIRI, of a litany of offenses, but above all abandoning their founding mission. 


Sender: Ziz <OneTrueZiz@gmail.com>


Subject: Fall of MIRI and CFAR


MIRI paid out to blackmail over statutory rape. Theft of donor funds to deceive donors. CFAR helped cover it up, implemented in part by their president and founder pushing anti-rationality, and anti-ethics, and perpetrating religious abuse, and using antitransfemist memes as a tool for gaslighting…


MIRI and CFAR started out as SIAI, an organization once functional enough to halt and pivot to AI alignment from accelerationism. They rotted…


If you do not want to die with this plague consuming our world, then turn your hopes back to the hard-to-define things that generated these institutions that no longer deserve them.


	Blank's friends recall trying to break the incident down the way they'd learned to at CFAR workshops, demonstrating how the protesters had failed to act rationally. But Blank, described by one friend as “both brilliant and also incredibly naive,” did not seem entirely convinced.


	BEFORE THE PROTEST, LASOTA WROTE a second email, this one addressed specifically to Yudkowsky. (Danielson was cc'd.) In it, she invoked allegations spread by a disgruntled ex-MIRI employee that Yudkowsky had committed statuatory rape, and she further accused him of starting an AI arms race that would exterminate life on Earth.


	The first set of allegations have been investigated and deemed baseless. They stem from a report filed by a onetime MIRI employee named Louie Helm who claimed a teenager was “being exploited” by a group of men, including Yudkowsky, who ran a local youth camp — referring to the Summer Program for Applied Rationality and Cognition, hosted by CFAR.


	According to the sealed police report obtained by Rolling Stone, Helm accused Yudkowsky of having a sexual relationship with a then-18-year-old that began at least two and half years prior. 

	











	Officers were dispatched to Yudkowsky's home, which, at the time, he shared with the 18-year-old in question. The “alleged victim,” officers wrote in the report, stressed that they “lived in a happy and safe environment.” That person later transitioned; today, he lives with his wife, whom he met in Berkeley's Rationalist scene, and their two young children. When I spoke to him earlier this year, he told me he rejects the notion that he was exploited by anyone other than Helm, the disgruntled employee, whom he felt used him as ammunition against Yudkowsky and MIRI. “I was expedient,” he says. 


	After Rolling Stone reached out to Yudkowsky for comment, he posted a lengthy response on X denying Helm's allegation, and writing, “To the best of my knowledge, I have never in my life had sex with anyone under the age of 18. I have not had sex, at all, with the particular person the Ziz cult thinks I had sex with, whom I am not naming here for reasons of their own privacy.” Helm did not respond to a request for comment. 


	Lasota was said to be sensitive to abuse concerns — one friend of Borhanian's tells me that “one of the reasons that she was so close to Ziz was that she was incredibly grateful to Ziz for helping her get out of an abusive relationship. It made her feel seen and accepted.” (Both Borhanian and Leatham lived in a group house called Guilt with a roommate who, they alleged, would regularly beat Borhanian with a bamboo stick. The roommate could not be reached for comment.)


	On her own blog, Lasota claimed she was “molested” by her grandfather, whom she called a “pedophile.” Robert Lasota, Dan's father and Ziz's grandfather, was convicted in late 1980s of molesting his daughter, but that conviction was later thrown out, and the case was retried, unsuccessfully, twice. (Reached by Rolling Stone, Lasota's grandparents strenuously denied Ziz's allegation.)


	Lasota's second accusation — that Yudkowsky started an AI arms race — referred to an uncomfortable truth: that Yudkowsky, despite his ceaseless warnings about the threat posed by AI, has arguably done more than any other person alive to hasten the acceleration of artificial intelligence technology.


	In 2005, shortly after he began working on The Sequences, Yudkowsky was introduced to Peter Thiel — the co-founder of PayPal and Palantir — at a dinner party in San Francisco. Thiel took an interest in his work and began funding Yudkowsky's Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and together, with famed computer scientist Ray Kurzweil, they created an annual conference, the Singularity Summit, at Stanford University. (Jeffrey Epstein was another early supporter of SIAI; he gave $50,000 through his own foundation in 2009.)


	The founders of the AI lab DeepMind persuaded Thiel to fund their startup, later purchased by Google, at the Singularity Summit. DeepMind's early success, in turn, impressed a young Thiel acolyte, Sam Altman, who went on to co-found Open AI with Elon Musk, a MIRI backer (and, apparently, a LessWrong reader — he connected with the singer Grimes after they made the same joke about a popular LessWrong thought experiment called “Roko's Basilisk”). Altman has credited Yudkowsky with sparking his pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence — artificial intelligence that is as smart as, or smarter, than humans.

	











	Many of the young readers who flocked to the Bay Area after reading Yudkowsky's work eventually went into the field of AI, too: Today, a notable share of the people Lasota emailed the night before the CFAR reunion are employed by the biggest firms developing artificial intelligence technology, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and DeepMind.


	In her message to Yudkowsky, Lasota invoked an epic battle of the kind that he had once promised his young readers: 


Our civilization is doing an unending holocaust, birth to death to 


many billions of sentient beings per year. That's what kind of 


morality you import when you import code from the system… 


We will not just sit on our hands and let you or your masters, or 


their god-Cancer conquer the world… We will exercise self defense, 


and we will defend each other, and we will defend sentient life...


And I stake my soul, and much more importantly the multiverse on justice 


without compromise or concession… If you want to make it out of this universe 


alive, I suggest you do the same.


Come clean, and we may talk of what can be done to pick up the pieces.












	The missive was signed:


Sinceriously,


Darth Ziz


(Interim de facto leader of the vegan Sith.)


	Lasota and Danielson remained convinced by Yudkowsky's warning of the dire threat posed by artificial intelligence. But where Yudkowsky's fear had revolved around the existential threat AI posed to mankind, the vegan Sith — which at that point, consisted only of Lasota and Danielson — recommitted with a fierce moral urgency to the cause of protecting all sentient life.  


	INSTEAD OF RALLYING THRONGS OF RATIONALISTS against MIRI and CFAR, the protest only seemed to drive Lasota and Danielson further to the fringes of the community. By December 2019, both had been banned from LessWrong after attempting to post their grievances about CFAR and MIRI there. A Facebook group called Bay Area Rationalist Community Safety Discussion sprung up, where the protest, and Lasota's role in it specifically, was dissected; Lasota was not allowed in the group, and Danielson complained that her own posts defending her friend were censored by moderators. They were booted from the MIRIx Discord server, banned from meetups for Slate Star Codex (another Rationalist forum) and unwelcome at REACH — the Rationalist and Effective Altruist Community Hub — a community space in Oakland.


	Most consequentially, a website, Zizians.info, appeared online, declaring Lasota the leader of a “peculiar online cult” that the site's author christened the “Zizians.” Earlier this year, as reporters puzzled over a string of murders allegedly committed by individuals in Lasota's orbit, the site was treated as an authority on the subject, the claims repeated uncritically in several stories. (Lasota, for her part, blasted the site's contents as “not just distortions but several jailbroken, outright lies” when it materialized in early 2020. She rejected most fiercely the author's assertion that she played any role in encouraging the suicides of two close friends.)


	The police response to the protest, and perhaps more so the reaction from the Rationalist community, had a profound impact on Lasota who, according to those who knew her, grew more pessimistic about humanity and the idea of redemption afterward. 


	Still facing a pile of fines and bills over the failures to maintain the Caleb, Lasota and Danielson were now being forced to pay, along with Leatham and Borhanian, for their legal defense in separate cases spawned by the protest. First there was the criminal case — all four were charged with conspiracy, trespassing, wearing a mask for an unlawful purpose, resisting arrest, false imprisonment, and child endangerment, the last charge added to account for the “emotional and mental suffering” of a class of school children at the retreat center that day — then a countersuit, filed by the protesters, alleging mistreatment at the hands of the sheriff's office during their arrest and detention.


	To remain close to their lawyers and the courthouse, the four of them stayed together in a series of Airbnbs near Santa Rosa. Daniel Blank, the young Rationalist who watched their protest from the highway, volunteered to serve as the foursome's process server, delivering paperwork to witnesses and a judge they sought to disqualify from the case. But soon they were banned from Airbnb, too. A host apparently recognized them from a newspaper article about the protest and contacted the platform, which revoked Borhanian's account for violating its terms of service.


	Not long after that, Lasota, Danielson, Leatham, and Borhanian moved onto a dusty lot at the end of a cul-de-sac in Vallejo, California, crowded with RVs and shipping containers, and owned by a man named Curtis Lind.


	LASOTA AND DANIELSON FIRST MET LIND when they pulled the Caleb up to the Pillar Point dock one day to refuel. Lind walked over and introduced himself as the owner of the Robert Gray, a 1932 Army Corps survey vessel. “I got to be pretty friendly with some of them — friendly enough so that I took one of them to a Walmart to buy [their] first bra,” Lind later told a documentary crew with NuReality Productions, who interviewed the octogenarian for an unrelated film project.

	











	When Lind sold his boat and moved onto the property he owned in Vallejo, Lasota and Danielson asked to join him. They had a new concept: Instead of boats, they would buy and outfit small, U-Haul-style box trucks. They called them “Slackmobiles” in reference to the idea of acquiring “slack” — sufficient surplus resources — to do things beyond simply struggling to survive. The ideological heir to the Rationalist Fleet, Slackmobiles were a way to recapture “mental and logistical autonomy,” Danielson wrote. 


	Owning a Slackmobile, Danielson wrote in 2020, had the added advantage of insulating them from the kind of “civilizational decay and collapse” Danielson estimated had 75 percent probability of occurring by 2025.


	Borhanian was especially passionate about Danielson's idea, one person who knew her tells me. The former Google software engineer believed if she could figure out a straightforward and scalable way to build Slackmobiles or teach others how to do it, the information could effectively prevent the best and brightest from being funneled into corporate jobs where they would ultimately burn out. If a person had slack, Borhanian believed, the time they might spend working to afford rent could be used for something more productive like AI safety, or advocating for the welfare of all sentient beings. 


	As they began to outfit their box trucks and RVs on Lind's lot in early 2020, their rent and expenses were mostly covered by Bitcoin, in which Borhanian and Leatham were both heavily invested, as well as savings Lasota had squirreled away during her time working at Google in 2018. Just as Bitcoin crashed in March 2020, and the group lost its ability to pay rent, they were offered some cosmic slack of their own: Because of the pandemic, the state of California placed a temporary moratorium on evictions. Soon after protections went into effect, Lind said, Lasota and the others stopped paying him.  


	In April of that year, Danielson's then-lawyer told the court that his client had disappeared; he heard they may have died by suicide. His repeated calls to Danielson went unanswered, he wrote, before the number was disconnected. Then, in August — the month after the moratorium on evictions ended — Lasota was reported missing, too, also presumed dead. 


	According to documents later filed in San Mateo District Court, on the afternoon of Aug. 19, 2022, Lasota had taken Borhanian and her youngest sister, Naomi Lasota, out “for an afternoon on the water” aboard the Black Cygnet, the small sailboat she purchased before the Caleb. Around 11 p.m., as the three headed back toward the marina, Lasota fell off the back of the boat and into the bay, according to Borhanian.

	











	“I lost sight of [Lasota] while looking for a life preserver,” Borhanian wrote in a petition intended to officially establish Lasota's death. The pair called the Coast Guard, which mounted an exhaustive search effort — involving a helicopter, a drone, and several boats — before it was called off, unsuccessful. 


	Lasota's parents placed an obituary in their hometown newspaper, remembering her love for “adventure, friends, and family, music, blueberries, biking, computer games, and animals.” 


	Dan Kapelovitz, the lawyer representing Lasota in the ongoing criminal case over the CFAR reunion protest, was still fighting for footage of her arrest when he received the news. He notified the court of Lasota's apparent death and formally requested to be let off the case, which he believes would eventually have been dropped. (“The government had an extremely weak case,” he tells me.) 


	Just a few months after Kapelovitz lodged his request, he received an email from the district attorney in Vallejo, informing him that his client was, in fact, alive.


	IN THE FALL OF 2022, APPARENTLY UNAWARE of the legal efforts to declare Lasota legally dead, Lind had sought a court order to formally evict her, Danielson, Borhanian, plus 18 other named residents and “all unknown occupants” whom, Lind alleged, owed him more than $60,000 back rent, damages, and other costs. Lind was granted a judgment against his tenants on Oct. 27 of that year.  Among those unknown occupants was an individual later named in court documents as Suri Dao, a former National Merit Scholar who identified as bigender and was estranged from their parents.


	Two and half weeks later — two days before the Solano County Sheriff was reportedly set to evict them — Dao approached Lind asking for help, he later said. There was a leak in Dao's trailer, and they didn't know how to turn the water off. According to Lind's account of the events, he was bending over outside Dao's trailer when he was hit on the back of the head.


	“The right hand side of my skull was shattered. My nose was shoved over flat,” Lind said in the unpublished video footage. He managed to get to his feet and pull out the gun he said he began wearing after Borhanian flashed a knife at him a few weeks earlier. Standing around him were Dao, Borhanian, and Leatham. Lind shot Borhanian fatally, then fired several rounds at Leatham before running out of ammunition.

	











	“I was bleeding from numerous puncture wounds — I think around 50. I couldn't see out of my right eye — had been punctured three times. The back of my neck had some severe cuts, like somebody was trying to cut my head off … Oh, and I had a sword, a long sword, all the way through my chest, right next to my heart, sticking out the other end,” Lind later said. The samurai sword was still sticking through his chest when he banged on the door of another tenant's nearby RV, telling him, “I'm dying.”


	Leatham and Dao were arrested that day and charged with aggravated mayhem, the attempted murder of Lind, as well as Borhanian's murder, under a California law that allows for a person to be charged if they provoke another person to kill. 


	At least one person blamed the Rationalist community's treatment of Lasota and her friends for the tragedy: In April 2023, an acquaintance, Octavia Nouzen — who claims to have helped author Zizians.info — wrote, “Emma is dead because we all called her and her friends a cult so much that they couldn't find anywhere to live” other than Lind's lot.


	A few days after Lind's stabbing, Lasota's former lawyer Dan Kapelovitz received an email from a deputy district attorney in Sonoma County.


	“I just wanted to reach out and let you know Lasota was contacted by police in Vallejo this weekend (Leatham was involved in an attack and was charged with attempted murder). Lasota was on scene, alive and well,” the deputy DA wrote.


	Lasota, according to reporting by the San Francisco Chronicle, had been handcuffed at gunpoint at the scene and taken to Vallejo police headquarters, “where a homicide investigator said she faked a medical emergency and was taken by ambulance to a hospital,” from which she later disappeared.

	











	THE NEXT TIME LASOTA APPEARED on law enforcement radar was two months later, on Jan. 12, 2023, at an airport hotel on the outskirts of Philadelphia. State police had come to Candlewood Suites to serve a warrant in connection with an investigation into the murders of Rita and Richard Zajko, the parents of a young Rationalist known to friends as Jamie. The couple was shot in their home two weeks earlier, on New Year's Eve — their child's 30th birthday.


	Police arrived at the hotel hoping to retrieve a 9 mm Smith & Wesson MP and a DNA sample belonging to Jamie Zajko. As Zajko, who is nonbinary, was being escorted by police out of the motel, they shouted to hotel staff to notify Zajiko's travel companion, Daniel Blank, that they had been detained. Blank, the young vegan Rationalist who watched the CFAR protest and later assisted the four during their legal troubles, had cut off contact with his own family a month earlier.


	Zajko, who had a masters degree in bioinformatics, was originally drawn into LessWrong after reading Yudkowsky's Harry Potter fan fiction. After college, they moved to the Bay Area where they interned at NASA and lived in the same group house, Guilt, with Borhanian, Leatham, and the roommate they accused of abuse. According to Danielson, they mounted an effort with Borhanian in 2019 to “get Jamie out” of their abusive living situation — even offering help to build a Slackmobile where they could live. 


	Their efforts failed, but they left a lasting impression on Zajko. “One of the last times I heard from Jamie, [they] told us a bit about [their] living in an RV by [themself] on that piece of land [they] bought,” a friend who knew Zajko from a LessWrong study group, tells me. Three years later, in August 2021, Zajko wrote on Tumblr about their decision to build a Slackmobile, an effort they say began in earnest “after I noticed the extent of my complicity with the animal murder industry.” That post was liked by Daniel Blank.


	A few weeks before he stopped speaking to his family, Blank, a Berkeley graduate and a beloved member of the Bay Area Rationalist community, known for his brilliance and generosity, posted on his own Tumblr: “I don't know if this is the sort of thing posted here, or if it'll get any response, but: I have been told that (and it seems accurate that) I am bad at coming up with strategies from scratch, and tend to follow whatever opportunities to do good come my way instead. Since I would like to devote my life to the truth, life, and agency of all sentient beings, and am largely lost on how to do so, has anyone any advice?”


	Before he dropped off radar, a friend from the Rationalist community tells me Blank “seemed to be successively joining various vegan groups and then being disappointed in the lack of efficacy.” The friend, an effective altruist, recalls that in her final conversation with Blank, “I tried to walk him into incrementalism, but I still worry that I was counterproductive. I said, ‘What are you going to do? Wage war on the non-vegan singlehandedly? You need to have a clear path to impact.' But I think that what he heard is, ‘You should wage war on the non-vegans singlehandedly.'”


	The last message Blank's parents received from him was a graphic video of animals being slaughtered. “Look what you've done,” he wrote, according to reporting from the news site VT Digger.

	











	The state troopers who detained Zajko in Pennsylvania knew Blank as Zajko's roommate — they had interviewed both of them about the Zajko murders a week earlier at the house where the pair were living in Vermont.


	When they learned — after Zajko called out to the hotel staff — that Blank was also in the hotel, they got a second search warrant — for the same gun and Blank's DNA — and forced their way into his room. They were surprised to find two people inside: Blank and another person, this one laying on the bathroom floor, unresponsive: Ziz Lasota.


	The trooper, using male pronouns for Lasota, later described the scene in court: “He had his eyes closed. He would not speak. He was just laying almost unconscious or as if he was dead on the ground.” It would eventually take “four or five” officers to carry Lasota out of the hotel room. “Just the weight of carrying a limp body is not easy,” the trooper said. Lasota, who police eventually managed with some difficulty to fingerprint, was charged with disorderly conduct and obstructing or hindering police. She was held on those charges in Pennsylvania for months, her bail set at $500,000.


	Lasota finally posted a reduced bail in June 2023. When she failed to show up at court that December, a judge issued a bench warrant for her arrest. By then, Zajko and Blank had returned to Vermont. Lasota and two others — Teresa Youngblut, a young HPMoR fan from Washington who adopted the name “Milo,” and a German quant trader called Ophelia Bauckholt, both vegans who were active in online Rationalist communities — were reportedly living together in an Airbnb in North Carolina. A little more than a year would pass, before violence would explode again — on opposite ends of the country, just a few days apart.


	On Jan. 20, 2025, Youngblut and Bauckholt were in Vermont, looking to purchase property, when they were pulled over by Border Patrol for an immigration check. (Bauckholt was in the U.S. on an H1-B visa, reserved for highly skilled workers.) According to a federal indictment, both the driver and passenger exited the vehicle and opened fire on the federal agents. One Border Patrol officer, David Maland, was killed in the firefight, as was Bauckholt. Youngblut was hospitalized and later charged with Maland's murder. Their guns, investigators would later learn, were purchased by Zajko.


	Three days earlier, on the other side of the country, just as the cases against Leatham and Suri Dao were preparing to go to trial, Curtis Lind — the key witness in those trials — was attacked again, this time fatally. Lind was approached and stabbed in the chest by a figure in a beanie and mask. A 22-year-old former Oxford student named Maximillian Snyder was arrested and charged with Lind's murder. Snyder, a Yudkowsky reader, had once been awarded an $11,000 AI Alignment research prize in a contest judged by MIRI's president and, records show, he had applied for a marriage license with Youngblut one month earlier. 

	











	Contacted in jail by a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle two weeks after his arrest, Snyder agreed to dictate an open letter over the phone: It was addressed to Yudkowsky, imploring him to go vegan. 


	Four weeks after that, Maryland State Police approached a pair of box trucks parked on an unpaved road near Frostburg, Maryland. In the cab of one of the trucks, State Trooper Brandon Jeffries would later recall in court records obtained by Rolling Stone, he found a young man dressed all in black: Daniel Blank. The windows of the second truck were fogged over, but when Jeffries unlatched the back door, he discovered two others, similarly clad in black and wearing holsters stocked with guns and ammunition: Lasota and Zajko. The trucks were registered to Youngblut. 


	TO PEOPLE WHO KNEW LASOTA AND the others, the seemingly inexplicable series of attacks that took place after they were pushed out of the Rationalist community fit within a common understanding.


	“The core thing motivating a lot of what they were doing was looking at the horrors of factory farming and being unwilling to accept it,” a friend explains. They were convinced “anybody who could tolerate this is a monster.” But there was another aspect, too: They believed “making it stop isn't enough. We need to make it not have happened in the first place.”


	According to Lasota's interpretation of Timeless Decision Theory, it is possible to “collapse the timeline” — making it so that certain events “never happened” at all. As one person puts it, the logic boils down to: “If you punish the people who do a bad thing hard enough, then there won't have been any incentive for them to do it in the first place, and therefore they won't have done it at all, in any alternate timeline.”

	











	This, people who knew Lasota suspect, is the ideology underpinning the series of violent encounters that Lasota's friends and acquaintances were involved with in the years that followed their protest of the CFAR reunion.


	According to Yudkowsky, it's also a bastardization of his original theory, now known as “Logical Decision Theory” or LDT. “I don't expect the Zizian concept of ‘Timeless Decision Theory' much resembles the actuality, though I have not tried to learn about the details of what they say they believe,” Yudkowsky tells me via email. “But at any rate, LDT does not say to assault your landlord or a passing police officer, because nothing particularly good will happen on this Earth if LDT-reasoners do that, and like most decision theories, LDT advises people to do things that have good consequences rather than bad consequences.”


	The reason that LDT — the former Timeless Decision Theory — is discussed in Rationalist circles at all is, as a former colleague of Lasota's tells me, because “it is a pretty realistic situation for AIs to find themselves in.” In that world — a world where countless, nearly identical simulations are run over and over again — there is simply a source code and a series of weights that can be changed to determine an output.


	The logic doesn't work in the real world because, in the real world, people don't function like perfectly predictable machines. Or, as a different friend, puts it: “ZDT” — Zizian decision theory — “is an excellent decision theory for getting your fucking friends killed.”


	LASOTA AND HER FRIENDS WERE DRAWN to the Bay Area by the promise that they could be heroes. Instead of reorienting toward the real world after they became disillusioned with the figures who perpetuated that fantasy, they dropped deeper into a shared delusion that they alone could change the course of history. And they lashed out violently at any point that reality — the reality that rent will eventually come due, the reality that we live in a society with laws, and courts, and fines, and police officers — intruded on their fantasy.   


	“Deeply immersed in Yudkowsky's ideas, the Zizians took his framework to an extreme, embracing anarchist ideology and actions. Their radicalization process highlights a key issue: The Rationality movement offers methods for deconstructing thinking and beliefs, but offers no safeguards to prevent vulnerable individuals from spiraling into self-destruction and such harmful extremes,” Dr. Nirit Weiss-Blatt, author of the book Techlash, tells me.


	Suri Dao and Somni Leatham, charged in the 2022 murder of Emma Borhanian, and the attempted murder of the landlord Curtis Lind, are scheduled to go to trial in Solano County in March 2026. Maximillian Snyder, who is charged in Lind's January 2025 murder, pleaded not guilty in March 2025; he is scheduled to return to Solano County Superior Court in January. His onetime partner, Teresa Youngblut, faces four federal charges in Vermont related to the murder of Border Patrol agent David Maland, a case in which prosecutors intend to pursue the death penalty. She has pleaded not guilty; a trial is pending.

	











	This summer, Gwen Danielson appeared in court in Sonoma County to answer the criminal charges related to the CFAR protest, which have been reduced to misdemeanors. “Due to the case still being open, Ms. Danielson has no comment at this time. She looks forward to concluding this matter and moving forward with her life,” attorney Scott Emrick, who is representing Danielson, tells Rolling Stone.


	Lasota, Zajko, and Blank remain in custody in Maryland on weapons, drugs, and trespassing charges; their trial is set to start in February. After that case is adjudicated, Lasota faces a separate set of federal charges filed against her in June. (When she was arrested in Maryland, the federal government alleges, Lasota was in possession of several guns which, as a fugitive of justice after skipping bail in Pennsylvania, she was prohibited from having. She faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison if convicted. Lasota pleaded not guilty to those charges in November; asked to state her age for the record in court, she replied: “Timeless.”) The cases against her in Pennsylvania and Sonoma County remain open, as well.

	From jail this spring, Zajko — who, along with Blank, remains a person of interest in Zajko's parents' murders in Pennsylvania — wrote an open letter, in which they reiterated Lasota's accusations against Yudkowsky, including the claim that Yudkowsky has accelerated progress toward an artificial general intelligence, declaring “Yudkowsky may yet kill the world!”


	In the letter, Zajko writes, “I have been unable to read the news while in jail.

Priscilla Presley fended off a challenge Monday that sought to disqualify her longtime lawyer, Marty Singer, as her attorney in her financial elder abuse lawsuit against memorabilia auctioneer Brigitte Kruse.


	At a morning hearing in Santa Monica, Calif., a judge said Kruse failed to convince him that Singer gave her legal advice in 2022 and 2023 related to her business dealings with Presley, thereby creating a conflict. The judge called Kruse's evidence “very thin” when it came to her claims Singer counseled her over the phone twice. In her motion, Kruse claimed she consulted with Singer when Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE) sent her a letter in August 2022 threatening litigation over an auction of Elvis-related memorabilia that Priscilla authenticated. She claimed they spoke again in February 2023, when EPE sent a cease-and-desist letter claiming Presley's deal to market a beauty serum violated the name, image and likeness rights she previously sold to EPE.


	“I have doubts,” Judge Mark Epstein told Kruse's lawyer about the alleged phone calls. “You've given me no evidence other than a statement by Ms. Kruse. I've got no retention agreement, no email, no phone record, no notes of a conversation, no reference to a conversation in a text to Ms. Presley. I got nothing.”

	The judge noted that Singer claimed in a sworn declaration that he had “no recollection” of any calls with Kruse. And even if the conversations occurred, the judge said, they were not “substantially related” to the financial elder abuse case. In his ruling denying Kruse's effort to disqualify Singer, the judge said he takes such motions seriously, but he also respects people's right to choose their own lawyer. He said Presley had a long history with Singer that predated her dealings with Kruse, so this wasn't a case where Presley hired Singer to gain an advantage.

	











	“While Ms. Kruse and the other defendants continue to throw the kitchen sink at this case to distract from the real issues and delay facing the music, Ms. Presley is anxious to move this case forward and hold defendants accountable for their actions,” Singer said in a statement sent to Rolling Stone Monday afternoon.

	Kruse's lead lawyer, Jordan Matthews, called the decision “irrelevant” late Monday. “The court's ruling does not mean Elvis Presley's ex-wife or Mr. Singer have been absolved, and we intend to hold them accountable for their actions, as we will not tolerate any sort of misconduct in this case,” Matthews tells Rolling Stone. “Priscilla Beaulieu continues to make claims without a shred of proof, seemingly relying on her celebrity status rather than evidence, even if it means bending the rules. Today's hearing changes nothing. We are moving forward aggressively, and we are prepared to bring forward major evidence that will reveal the truth, which cannot be ignored.”


	Presley, 80, and Kruse, 42, are locked in a bitter battle over the companies Presley formed with Kruse and investor Kevin Fialko to monetize Presley's name, image, and likeness. In her July 2024 financial elder abuse complaint, Presley claimed Kruse and Fialko “manipulated” her into signing the contracts after they allegedly isolated her from her longtime business and legal advisors. She said the pair placed a “stranglehold” on her finances with contracts that gave Kruse a controlling 51 percent interest in Priscilla's intellectual property in perpetuity. She said another related venture gave her only a 20 percent share and that altogether, she was duped out of more than $1 million. She and her lawyers called the contracts so “egregious” and “unconscionable,” they're unenforceable.


	For their part, Kruse and Fialko claim they were always truthful and invested heavily in the joint ventures to pull Presley back from the brink of insolvency. (Video obtained by Rolling Stone shows Presley appearing fully cognizant and signing many of the documents at issue at Kruse's Florida home in January 2023.) According to Kruse and Fialko, Presley allegedly made an about-face and shunned them, in violation of their contracts, once her fortunes changed after the 2023 death of Lisa Marie Presley, her only child with Elvis.

	As Rolling Stone previously reported, a few weeks after Lisa Marie's death, Priscilla challenged a 2016 amendment to her daughter's Promenade Trust that removed Priscilla as a trustee and replaced her with Lisa Marie's eldest daughter, Riley Keough. The disputed change meant Priscilla would have lost influence over her daughter's assets, including Graceland mansion, its archives, and Lisa Marie's 15 percent interest in EPE, which owns and manages Elvis' name, image, and likeness. Priscilla wanted the court to declare the amendment “invalid.”

	











	With a potential legal war looming, Keough reached a generous settlement with her grandmother in a matter of months. Under the deal, Priscilla received a $1 million lump-sum payment off the top of Lisa Marie's $25 million life insurance policy. Keough also agreed to pay Priscilla $50,000 to resign as co-trustee of the irrevocable trust whose sole asset was the life insurance policy. Priscilla was also awarded an annual salary of $100,000 for 10 years for her new role as a “special adviser” to the Promenade Trust.

	After she settled with Keough, Presley sent a cease-and-desist to Kruse and Fialko in August 2023. Two months later, she was hit with the first breach-of-contract lawsuit over the partnership. Nine months after that, she filed her bombshell claims of financial elder abuse.


	Last summer, a judge put Kruse's Florida-based lawsuit on hold, saying Presley's elder abuse lawsuit should proceed first. The Orlando-based judge said it didn't make sense to “enforce rights under agreements” when the “validity” of the agreements remained “squarely in dispute in the California case.” That ruling set the stage for Kruse and Fialko to file their breach-of-contract claims as a standalone, $50 million lawsuit filed in Beverly Hills in August, then as a cross-complaint in the Santa Monica elder abuse case in October.

Physicists at the University of Albany, New York, have announced a new research initiative—dubbed UAlbany Project X—that marks the beginning of a long-term scientific study of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP).

The new project, officially launched last month, was made possible by an endowment gift that will provide ongoing funding for the team's scientific investigation of aerial mysteries, which are currently also being investigated in a separate effort by the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).

Kevin Knuth, Ph.D., a professor of physics at the University of Albany and one of the new project's lead scientists, told The Debrief that UAlbany Project X (UAPx) is an outgrowth of many years of ongoing research that he and his colleagues behind the new effort have already undertaken.

“We've been working on studying UAP scientifically for about seven years now,” Knuth explained, adding that his entry into the study of aerial mysteries began with an examination of the many decades of information that have been collected on the topic.

“I started by just doing what a physicist ought to do, which is getting your head around the problem,” Knuth told The Debrief. This ultimately led to his collaboration with scientists from the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies to author a 2019 paper that estimated the minimum speeds and accelerations of UAP observed in several notable cases. Among these was a 2004 incident involving an object observed by U.S. Navy personnel aboard the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) during training exercises off the southern California coast.

Footage of the object, popularly known today as the “Tic Tac,” was obtained by an FA/18 Super Hornet pilot named Chad Underwood and subsequently leaked online. In 2020, the Pentagon confirmed the footage was authentic in an official release accompanied by two other historic videos purportedly depicting UAP, while noting that the object in the 2004 video remained “unidentified.”

That incident, Knuth says, had been part of what led him and fellow University of Albany physicist and associate professor Matthew Szydagis, along with several colleagues, to conduct a field expedition in 2021 off the coast of Santa Catalina Island with a non-profit scientific research organization called UAPx.

“We worked to have an updated collection mission over the Catalina Channel where the Nimitz Encounter occurred,” Knuth told The Debrief, during which the University of Albany researchers collected observable-light and infrared imagery, and other data that helped them develop a framework for the scientific documentation of UAP.

That work culminated in a paper by Szydagis and co-authored by Knuth and their colleague, University of Albany associate professor Cecilia Levy—the core of the new UAlbany Project X initiative—published in Progress in Aerospace Sciences earlier this year.

“This was a really seminal paper,” Szydagis told The Debrief, describing it as “a summary of UAPx's first results from the Catalina-Laguna mission.”

“I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of scientists who have gotten their work on the UAP topic published in such a high-caliber journal,” Szydagis said. A second co-authored paper on the history of the UAP subject, with Knuth as the lead author, had appeared in the same edition of the journal, along with a separate study by Luc Dini, Geoffrey Mestchersky, and Jacques Vallée that provided estimates of energy values associated with a historic UAP incident.

“It's a highly reputable journal that is cited by a lot of other scientists,” Szydagis said. “And yet, nobody talked about either that paper or Kevin's history paper.”

“In the UAPx paper, we did something that we thought would be considered very important,” Szydagis said. “We concluded the paper with suggestions on how to quantify the meaning of extraordinary evidence, and very few people seem to be paying attention to that.”

Today, while UAP—or UFOs, as they are traditionally known—often succeed in dominating prime time television news segments, podcasts, and occasionally even mainstream publications like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and other peer-reviewed journals like Nature: Scientific Reports, the majority of the attention the subject receives goes toward the question of government secrecy, and how much more the U.S. intelligence community may know about UAP than it has disclosed to the public.

Such questions had been the focus of a recent documentary, The Age of Disclosure, by filmmaker Dan Farah, in which a trove of current and past U.S. government officials that included Marco Rubio, currently serving as U.S. Secretary of State, and James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence, spoke on the record about the issue of transparency regarding information collected about UAP.

Yet, while the question over government secrecy involving UAP commands much of the attention in the media cycle, that isn't to say that the work of scientists—particularly those with the University of Albany team—had been overlooked by everyone.

Enter Tony Gorman, a well-known Albany-area businessman with many years of experience who was previously a co-owner of The Gorman Group, a family-owned highway construction company that has operated in the area for many decades.

Gorman had seen a short local news story about the UAP research Knuth, Szydagis, and Levy were conducting at the University of Albany, which prompted him to reach out to the team to help ensure an ongoing source of funding for their work.

“I have always been curious about UAPs and what could possibly be out there,” Gorman said in a statement. “When I saw the UAP research the UAlbany team is doing, I wanted to learn more.”

Gorman reached out and, after a series of discussions with the UAlbany researchers, decided to put his money behind their scientific efforts.

“I gained so much respect for their work,” Gorman said. “Right there, I knew I wanted to get involved.”

“We received this donation from Tony Gorman,” Knuth told The Debrief. “A generous donation, which basically funds us for five years, and in addition to that, sets up an endowment that funds us in perpetuity.”

“So we're here to stay.”

“We have money to help sustain us for the long term,” Szydagis told The Debrief. “With Tony's very generous gift, we have the potential ability to be working on UAP for the rest of our lives.”

As for what the team specifically plans to work on, Szydagis explained that part of its plan is to leverage knowledge from past research while carefully plotting a course forward through strategic investigations that will help the physicists expand the data they are collecting on UAP.

“We're planning a long-term, cautious, sustainable plan to keep working on UAPs for decades to come,” Szydagis said, though noting that the team is also working to ensure that it does not add to “the clutter of more projects and more silos.”

“So the old UAPx is closing down, and it's being reborn,” Szydagis told The Debrief. “We are preserving UAPx's original mission.”

“Through an incredibly generous gift from Tony Gorman, Professors Knuth, Matthey Szydagis, and Cecilia Levy have secured a major endowment to launch UAlbany Project X (UAPx)—the direct academic continuation of everything we've built from scratch,” wrote Gary Voorhis, a U.S. Navy veteran and former CEO and co-founder of the original nonprofit UAPx.

“They did it. They took our little rag-tag expedition team and turned it into a funded, university-backed research program with the potential to run for decades,” Voorhis wrote.

Knuth says the new UAlbany Project X will seek not only to collect more data on UAP but also to clarify the subject, how science can be applied to it, and to help dispel misconceptions about UAP.

In addition to the core University of Albany team, the researchers have announced they will receive input from experts, including physicist Eric W. Davis, who Szydagis said will work with the team on a volunteer basis as an adjunct researcher in an advisory position for the project.

“We are deeply honored to have him,” Dr. Szydagis told The Debrief.

“There has been a lot of excellent work done,” Knuth added, although noting that he hopes UAlbany Project X will be able to take scientific approaches to UAP research into new and exciting areas.

“I think the best thing to do is to learn from the mistakes of others, and to build on their successes,” Knuth said. “We've gotten diffraction gratings for high-quality cameras, and we plan to collect spectra. And magnetic and electric fields are often omitted from study, and so we plan to accommodate that as well, along with an excellent network of multiple cameras.”

“We have plans to build arrays of cameras to watch the sky and have this portable,” Knuth told The Debrief. “Basically, take your equipment and plant it somewhere for a couple of weeks, and collect data. That's the way to do it.”

Thanks to Gorman's endowment, the team also plans to ramp up publication of scientific papers on UAP.

“You should expect more papers from us, not just field expeditions,” Szydagis told The Debrief. “We've got all kinds of ideas on papers we want to publish on this topic broadly. And now we can start working on more of these things.”

“We no longer have to just work on this for free in our volunteer time,” Szydagis added, “which is not sustainable long-term.”

Fundamentally, Szydagis says that he, Levy, and Knuth will continue the mission that began during the original UAPx field expedition in 2021 and advance those efforts by collecting new data in the years ahead.

“UAPx is a phoenix being reborn,” Szydagis said. “It's not dying, it's not disappearing.”

“The mission will continue as a university effort.”

Aston Martin F1 star Fernando Alonso has described his car as having 'disconnections' that are a 'bit paranormal' following a good result at the Qatar Grand Prix.


44-year-old Alonso finished up in seventh in the main race at the Lusail International Circuit, and claimed a valuable six points for his team in their fight for sixth in the constructors' championship. 


However, he was lucky to get away with a spin on lap 42, which spun him around 360 degrees, and he carried on in the race without too much bother. The incident did cost him two places, however, with the Spaniard running up in fifth until that spin.


After the race, Alonso tried to explain what happened to cause him to spin around despite not having contact with any other car, and suggested that there could be paranormal forces at play.


""No, I was taking it easy,"" Alonso told media after the race. 


""The truth is that I wasn't pushing 100%, but this car has disconnections, I don't know what to call them, a bit paranormal, there's a spirit inside the car.""


""Then yesterday, I suddenly lost the front end for three or four corners. In one of them, I suddenly went off onto the gravel, turning the steering wheel all the way. It was as if I had no front wheels. 


""And today it was the rear wheels, suddenly a lash, so we're hypersensitive to the wind, hypersensitive to one or two degrees of temperature, we're always on a knife edge and today I made that mistake, but fortunately I was very lucky that there was no gravel, that there was nothing and that I didn't have a train of cars behind me.""


Nevertheless, seventh in the main race was a handy result for Alonso, and he remains in with a chance of claiming a top-10 spot in the drivers' championship with one event remaining in the season.


His recent flurry of points since the Spanish GP in June has come despite him having to drive such an inconsistent Aston Martin car, and he is sincerely hoping that the team can improve for the final year of his current contract.


Alonso has admitted that he may retire at the end of 2026, but only if he gets a season where he can challenge nearer to the front again next year.


Aston Martin are a very ambitious team, and are hoping to be challenging for race wins in the near future, taking on the likes of design legend Adrian Newey and Ferrari stalwart Enrico Cardile in their attempts to do so.


Having not won a race since the 2013 Spanish GP, Alonso is very much hoping to benefit from the predicted upward trend of the Silverstone-based outfit.

The Bennu Sample!

Planetary scientists have found a wide range of molecules that are crucial for life among a lot of other organic substances present in asteroids, meteors, and even interstellar space. Now, scientists report new insights into asteroid Bennu, which was sampled by the NASA mission OSIRIS-REx. The latest research suggests tentative evidence for a substance we have not encountered before in extraterrestrial material.

When it comes to molecules fundamental to life, we usually focus on the nucleotide bases: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil, which are the fundamental units of DNA and RNA. There are also amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. Although over 500 are known, only 22 are used by known life. Of those 22, only 14 have been found in stuff from outer space – until now, possibly.

The new work confirms the presence in the sample of all five nucleobases and of the 14 amino acids that were already found by others. They also report tentative detections of tryptophan, a pretty important amino acid. This molecule is the precursor of the neurotransmitter and “happiness molecule” serotonin, of the hormone melatonin, which regulates the sleep cycle, and the vitamin B3. A form of vitamin B3 has previously been detected in the Bennu sample, which gives credence to this new detection.

Still, the team is looking into other ways to check the Bennu material to confirm the presence of tryptophan without doubt. Tryptophan is pretty fragile, so it is not a big surprise that it has not been found before in meteorites. The delicate collection of 121.6 grams (4.3 ounces) of material by OSIRIS-REx might have kept this and other dainty molecules safe.

“Our findings expand the evidence that prebiotic organic molecules can form within primitive accreting planetary bodies and could have been delivered via impacts to the early Earth and other Solar System bodies, potentially contributing to the origins of life,” the authors wrote in the paper.

OSIRIS-REx dropped a capsule with the sample in the Utah desert after over two years orbiting the 500-meter (1,630-foot) wide Bennu, which is currently the number one most dangerous asteroid, as it has a 1-in-1,750 chance of hitting our planet between 2178 and 2290. The date of greater risk is September 24, 2182. Coincidentally, the sample came back to Earth on September 24, 2023.

The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

      LUCY MURGATROYD, TV REPORTER



A Downton Abbey star looks totally unrecognisable sporting a very different look in the 'absorbing' supernatural Netflix thriller Talamasca: The Secret Order. 

The supernatural horror spy thriller, which is based on Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles and Lives of the Mayfair Witches, premiered on AMC in October this year.

On December 1, the show landed on Netflix in the UK and many have already binged the full six-part series. 

'A young lawyer with an unusual gift joins an ancient, secretive agency to unravel a supernatural mystery - and confront his family's dark past,' the streaming service's synopsis reads.  

The show stars Nicholas Denton as Guy Anatole, Celine Buckens as Doris, Maisie Richardson-Sellers as Olive and William Fichtner as Jasper.

Another actress in the programme is Elizabeth McGovern - who has taken on the role of Helen.

Many will know Elizabeth for a number of other roles including Ordinary People, The Handmaid's Tale and The Wife. 

She also played Cora, Countess of Grantham, in Downton Abbey between 2010 and 2015. 

Helen new character looks totally different to her alter-ego on the ITV drama. 

In Downton Abbey, the star rocked brunette hair, while in the new series, she's got a much lighter platinum bob and vampy makeup. 

And many fans have raved over the 'superb' acting in the show on IMDB.

'The series itself is a great concept. Well acted. Well done.' 

'Absolutely love it.' 

'Looking forward to seeing where this goes and if it keeps going after recently revealing their main plot. 

'Its a breath of fresh air compared to other fantasy adventure shows out there. My only common is it needs to showcase mo powers, less talk.'

'Loving it so far.' 

'Excellent so far, brilliant casting, so happy - finally someone's building a good story, creating a mood, clever writing and good performances.

'I'm excited to see if they'll maintain the quality, but based on what I've seen so far, it's very well done. And - what's with the negative reviews? Looks like very high quality to me, and is elevated above the usual pedestrian tedium and predictable scripts.' 

'Damn it, it's good.'

'The cliffhangers on the final episode make me excited and hopeful for a second season.' 

'Talamasca is one of those rare supernatural shows that feels fresh, intelligent, and genuinely atmospheric. 

'Instead of relying on cheap scares or flashy effects, it leans into world-building, character depth, and a slow-burning sense of mystery - and it absolutely works.'

'Very impressive!'

'I really enjoyed the show. Not what I thought it was going to be when I started watching it, but it is very well done in my opinion. 

'I have to have so many characters in this review so I keep talking and talking and talking and talking. Damn I still don't have enough. I'm almost there. Finally, I finished.' 

'There's a great plot and interesting characters. It keeps me guessing and I'm always on the edge of my seat watching. I'm praying for a 2nd season!'

Many are desperate to know if there will be a second series.

And although nothing has been confirmed, protagonist Nicholas Denton has hinted that he wants the programme to make a return. 

He told TV Insider: 'The first season's really interesting because you've got to start.

'You're setting up a new world, new lore, new characters, you're building them up, and you want to set them free, let 'em go nuts on the world. 

'And that's what I'm hoping for.'

He added that 'there's the rest of the world to cover' and 'there's a lot to unpack' with Guy and Doris (Celine Buckens).  

Talamasca: The Secret Order was created by John Lee Hancock and the showrunners include John and Mark Lafferty. 

The likes of Tomi May, Will Brown, Bryony Hannah, Eric Bogosian and Jason Schwartzman also appear on the programme. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Review","https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/02/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 15:00:30 GMT","

After being caught in the middle of yet another Space Pirate scuffle with the Galactic Federation, this time a mishap with a strange artefact sees Samus zapped away to the planet Viewros. There, she's enlisted by the holographic ghosts of the Lamorn to help preserve and release their dead civilisation's knowledge into the wider galaxy. To do this, you must reach and retrieve five teleporter keys from five different biomes and regions on this planet.



Stripped of her equipment, as is tradition, Samus is given the beginnings of a brand new set of gear, almost all with a slick new purple hue… because they're pretty much all psychic. A gemstone is embedded in her helmet, so the scanning visor also allows for a variety of telekinetic manipulations, the beam cannon can now fire guided bolts, and there's barely visible platforms and grapple points that you need the psychic view and psychic grapple to manipulate. The nomenclature is pretty ham-fisted, but it is an effective blend of the old and the new, successfully adding a new layer on top and around the core gameplay. It can be a little confounding at times, when confronted by a puzzle that leans on a less commonly used mechanic. I often forgot that I could turn a morph ball bomb into a grab-able psychic bomb to trigger raised nodes, for example.



You have that same blend of old and new, from a Metroid series perspective, for the controls and combat. The fundamentals are now those of a modern first person shooter, though you still lock on with the left trigger and automatically circle strafe around enemies. This means you can easily keep moving and evading incoming attacks thanks to this, and then move your actual target point on screen using the right stick or with motion controller after touch. Alternatively you can drop in and out of mouse mode when playing with detached Joy-Con 2 on Nintendo Switch 2, getting more of a PC FPS control scheme, which certainly has advantages for quick and precise aiming.

Personally, I kept things very vanilla, playing purely with controller, no motion controls, and then regularly re-aiming with a snap as needed. This generally worked very well for me, though it's fair to say that it does struggle a bit when trying to target certain enemies in a crowd – some of the combat-heavy sections really throw a lot of enemies at you – and for targeting weak spots during the larger scale boss battles. Those moments aren't common, and you can overcome them with a little patience, the game generally feeling quite forgiving in these most frantic and frenetic moments.



Through the opening biome of the adventure, the mixture of nature and sandstone-like ruins ably demonstrates the downfall of the Lamorn civilisation and how nature was corrupted around them. From here, things get far more heavy metal, from lighting powered factories to facilities deep in a volcano and beyond – are the Lamorn actually Bond villains?

They're typical elemental archetypes, but I rather enjoyed how the Lamorn facilities and technology have more than a hint of H.R. Giger, Alien and Prometheus to their look and feel. It's obviously not wholly original, but this biomechanical style absolutely works for me.



Instead of linking these regions together directly, they're instead joined up by the barren desert of Sol Valley, a wide open expanse that you need Samus' new Vi-O-La motorbike to cross in any sensible amount of time. It's a pretty slick addition and it's fun to zip up and over the sand dunes, crashing through green crystals and searching for the handful of secrets and points of interest between locations.

You can be attacked during these moments by a few different types of fast-moving enemy, and thankfully things are kept quite light, thanks to a locking homing disc attack… or you can generally just avoid them. The only issue is that there's not that much to do here. There's a handful of Breath of the Wild-like puzzle temples to seek out, and green crystals that you need to power up your Power Beam, but it's largely just connective tissue between the regions.



And you will be going back and forth plenty. Backtracking and exploring newly accessible parts of the world is a key part of the Metroidvania formula, and in some ways Metroid Prime 4 does this very well, and in others it makes it a bit of a chore. Actually getting back to previous locations isn't fast travel fast, but thanks to the bike, it's also not actually all that time consuming. It does still feel like dead time, but the actual time you spend trekking back and forth isn't too bad when you feel focused on an objective.

The real problem with this, though, is the game simply doesn't leave you alone to soak in the atmosphere and figure things out for yourself. Early on in the adventure you meet Specialist Miles MacKenzie, who fights alongside you for a brief period, before setting up a camp for himself and any other Federation Troopers that you find along the way, putting together a rag-tag team of survivors. They're a contrasting group of characters, but MacKenzie stands out for his… quirky dialogue, when compared to the more by-the-book nature and tone of some other troopers (who I inevitably liked more).



I have mixed feelings about this and how it affects the storytelling alongside the stoically silent Samus. The vast majority of the game, is spent on your own with rare interjections over comms when exploring a region, but once you've completed an area, beaten a boss, found a new tech part, it feels like MacKenzie helicoptering in like an overbearing parent to make sure you don't get lost. That's even more annoying on the handful occasions where he's actively misleading, “helpfully” suggesting I visit one locale or another only for me to hit a familiar dead end and double back again. If I'd done this on my own? Fine, but for it to be because the game effectively lied to me is annoying. I know this handholding is important for the game's accessibility, but there really should be an option to turn this off.

For the overarching story, I really liked the drip feed of learning what happened to the Lamorn and how their civilisation died, picking up the journals and logs, and finding their psychic statues. The broad team of Federation Troopers did also grow on me for their key moments and narrative payoffs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=psyops","S. Korean military psyops unit began sending leaflets into North a year before martial law crisis, whistleblower says","https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/1232440.html","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 08:36:00 GMT","

A former soldier who participated in leaflet-dropping operations against North Korea has testified that the Defense Psychological Operation Group, a unit directly under the Ministry of National Defense, secretly sent leaflets to North Korea from October 2023 until just before the emergency martial law declaration on Dec. 3, 2024. 

While some media reports previously indicated that propaganda leaflets were sent by military authorities as well as civilian groups during the Yoon Suk-yeol administration, this is the first time a soldier involved in the operation has provided testimony. 

The Defense Psychological Operation Group, or DPOG, is a unit tasked with conducting psychological warfare operations, such as distributing leaflets and broadcasting via loudspeakers, in times of emergency.

“In mid-October 2023, I sent about 10 large balloons carrying leaflets toward the North for the first time with fellow unit members at the front line,” the former soldier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the Hankyoreh on Sunday. The young man served in the psyops unit from 2023 to 2024. 

The whistleblower's unit reportedly conducted operations about once or twice every two months from then until November 2024. From then on, according to the former soldier, the unit released about 100 balloons per operation, each carrying approximately 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of leaflets.

The DPOG's leaflet dispersal operations intensified after the Constitutional Court struck down a legal provision banning the sending of leaflets to North Korea on Sept. 26, 2023, finding it unconstitutional. 

“Before the Constitutional Court's decision, we conducted leaflet distribution training in rear bases. Starting that September, we began training at the bases near the Military Demarcation Line, and more frequently as well,” the former soldier said. He added that he and others conducted realistic training for about a month and then, the following month in October, actually sent balloons carrying leaflets to North Korea.

According to the whistleblower, the psyops unit at the time marked North Korean military bases, airports and cities with a certain population size on military maps. They then calculated wind direction and speed in real-time to determine the most suitable targets for leaflet balloons. The former soldier said troops sent leaflets “as far as Wonsan” on the eastern coast. 

The psychological warfare unit conducted operations on days when civilian groups were known to send leaflets to North Korea, to avoid exposure of their activities. “Around 9 to 11 pm, unit members would change out of their military uniforms, which had their names and unit affiliations, into black clothing worn by special operations personnel before being deployed for the operation,” the former soldier said. The leaflet balloons were not only launched by the whistleblower's unit but also from multiple locations along the central and western fronts.

Rep. Boo Seung-chan of the Democratic Party, who has been tracking the DPOG's leaflet activities, said that the operations were part of Yoon's plan to concoct an excuse for invoking martial law.

“The Yoon administration sought to provoke North Korea not only with drones infiltrating Pyongyang but also with propaganda leaflets in order to create justification for declaring martial law,” Boo said.

On Feb. 22, 2020, “Mad” Mike Hughes towed a homemade rocket to the Mojave Desert and launched himself into the sky. His goal? To view the flatness of the Earth from space. This was his third attempt, and tragically it was fatal. Hughes crashed shortly after takeoff and died. 

Hughes' nickname – Mad Mike – might strike you as apt. Is it not crazy to risk your life fighting for a theory that was disproven in ancient Greece? 

But Hughes' conviction, though striking, is not unique. Across all recorded cultures, people have held strong beliefs that seemed to lack evidence in their favor – one might refer to them as “extraordinary beliefs.” 

For evolutionary anthropologists like me, the ubiquity of these kinds of beliefs is a puzzle. Human brains evolved to form accurate models of the world. Most of the time, we do a pretty good job. So why do people also often adopt and develop beliefs that lack strong supporting evidence? 

In a new review in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, I propose a simple answer. People come to believe in flat Earth, spirits and microchipped vaccines for the same reasons they come to believe in anything else. Their experiences lead them to think those beliefs are true. 

Most social scientists have taken a different view on this subject. Supernatural beliefs, conspiracy theories and pseudoscience have struck researchers as totally impervious to contrary evidence. Consequently, they have assumed that experience is not relevant to the formation of those beliefs. Instead, they've focused on two other explanatory factors.

The first common explanation is cognitive biases. Many psychologists argue that humans possess mental shortcuts for reasoning about how the world works. For instance, people are quite prone to seeing intentions and intelligence behind random events. A bias of this kind might explain why people often believe that deities control phenomena such as weather or illness.

The second factor is social dynamics: People adopt certain beliefs not because they're sure that they're true but because other people hold those beliefs, or they want to signal something about themselves to others. For example, some conspiracy theorists may adopt strange beliefs because those beliefs come with a community of loyal and supportive co-believers.

Both of these approaches can partly explain how people come to hold extraordinary beliefs. But they discount three ways that experience, in tandem with the other two factors, can shape extraordinary beliefs.

First, I propose that experience can act as a filter. It determines which extraordinary beliefs can successfully spread throughout a population.

Take the flat Earth theory as an example. We know with absolute certainty that it's false, but it's no more or less wrong than a theory that the Earth is shaped like a cone. So what makes flat Earth so much more successful than this equally incorrect alternative?

The answer is as obvious as it seems – the Earth looks flat when you're standing on it, not cone-shaped. Visual evidence favors one extraordinary belief over the others. Of course, scientific evidence clearly shows that the Earth is round; but it's not surprising that some people prefer to trust what their eyes are telling them. 

My second argument is that experience acts as a spark for extraordinary beliefs. Strange experiences, such as auditory hallucinations, are difficult to explain and understand. So people do their best to explain them – and in doing so, they come up with beliefs that seem fittingly strange. 

For this pathway, sleep paralysis is a good case study. Sleep paralysis happens in the space between sleeping and waking – you feel like you're awake, but you can't move or speak. It's terrifying and quite common. And interestingly, sufferers usually feel like there's a threatening agent sitting on their chest. 

As a scientist, I interpret sleep paralysis as the result of neural confusion. But it's not difficult to picture how someone without a scientific background – that is, nearly every human being in history – might interpret the experience as evidence of supernatural beings.

To me, the third potential route to extraordinary beliefs is especially intriguing. In many cases, people don't just develop extraordinary beliefs; they develop immersive practices that make those beliefs feel true.

For instance, imagine that you're a farmer living in the highlands of Lesotho in southern Africa, where I conduct ethnographic fieldwork. You suffer a series of miscarriages, and you want to know why. So you go to a traditional healer – she tells you that you can learn the answer from your ancestors by drinking a hallucinogenic brew. You drink the brew. Soon after, you begin to see spirits; they speak to you and explain your misfortune.

Clearly, an experience like this one might reinforce your belief in the existence of spirits. Such immersive practices – such as prayer, ritualistic dance and the religious use of psychoactive substances – create evidence that makes the associated beliefs feel true. 

Extraordinary beliefs are not inherently good or bad. In particular, religious beliefs provide meaning, security and a sense of community for billions of people. 

But some extraordinary beliefs are sources of serious concern: Misinformation about science and politics is rampant and immensely dangerous. By recognizing how those beliefs are shaped by experience, researchers can find better ways to combat their spread.

Just as importantly, though, my suggested perspective might encourage more compassion and kinship toward people who hold beliefs that seem very different from yours. They are not “mad” or insincere. Like any other human being, they think the evidence is on their side.

			Politico journalist Ryan Lizza spoils launch of ex-fiancee Olivia Nuzzi's memoir amid frantic anticipation in US media world

Olivia Nuzzi was the blonde purveyor of gossipy magazine pieces, a Hunter S Thompson in high heels patrolling the inner sanctum of Trump world.

Ryan Lizza, 20 years her senior, was chief Washington correspondent for Politico, the wonkish political news site. Together they were the golden couple of Washington journalism.

Last year, their relationship exploded in public fashion when it emerged she had an alleged affair with Robert F Kennedy Jr while she was reporting on his run for the White House.

Her book, American Canto, is published on Tuesday with a fresh wave of revelations. It details her affair with Mr Kennedy but comes with a slew of new details.

She describes how the man who is now Donald Trump's health secretary was taking psychedelic drugs during his run for president, how her brother offered to kill her ex-fiance when he allegedly threatened to share intimate messages with the press, and how she could have saved her job with Vanity Fair magazine if she had written a tell-all account of the affair.

Yet it lands as the latest salvo in an extraordinary media break-up.

Lizza, 51, beat her to the punch with a string of blog posts during the past fortnight.

In his first round of recriminations, he alleged that Nuzzi had an affair with Mark Sanford, a former presidential candidate and Republican politician from South Carolina, in 2020.

Then he published lines of toe-curling poetry, with apparent allusions to oral sex, that he attributed to Mr Kennedy.

“I mean to squeeze your cheeks to force open your mouth... I am a river. You are my canyon. I mean to flow through you. I mean to subdue and tame you. My love,” it ran.

The timing of his interventions (four so far) followed what should have been the start of a marketing blitz for Nuzzi's memoir.

The New York Times ran a complimentary profile under the headline “Olivia Nuzzi did it all for love,” complete with black and white photographs that cast her as the “modern iteration of a Hitchcock blonde”.

The result is that Nuzzi's book arrives amid frantic anticipation in the US media world.

The 31-year-old tells her side of the story as details of her affair with RFK Jr – referred to only as “The Politician” throughout – began leaking into the public a year ago.

Her job at New York magazine was on the line, and she describes her increasing fear that her life was imploding. She begins to see threats everywhere, asking a friend to help search her car for GPS trackers.

At one point her brother even seems to suggest killing Lizza for allegedly offering “a trove of intimate materials” to the press.

The alleged affair is believed to have begun in 2023, when the reporter was covering Mr Kennedy's independent run for president.

New York Magazine placed her on leave last year as news of the affair spread last September.

At the time, she acknowledged having an “emotional relationship” with him but insisted it did not affect her coverage of his campaign.

Yet in her book, she confirms one of Lizza's revelations, that she helped RFK Jr manage his media image.

In the course of her reporting, she stumbled across one of the most fascinating stories of the whole 2024 election, the tale of how RFK Jr dumped a dead bear cub in Manhattan's Central Park a decade earlier.

Rather than make it the centrepiece of the profile she was writing, she advises him to try to get “ahead of the story,” presenting it in the most favourable light.

“By get ahead of the story,” she continues, “I did not mean to suggest that he should appear on camera to introduce the facts through a more entertaining story than his enemies could ever dream of planting in the press to a shocked and horrified-looking Roseanne Barr.” Which is what happened.

Nor did she report on his drug use at the time.

She writes: “The Politician still did some psychedelics for fun, he said. He described how he waited until his wife was not home to go outside and smoke DMT, just as he waited until she wasn't home to call [me], or else he would call while locked in the bathroom.”

Nuzzi describes how she even helped him make the decision about who to endorse when he ended his independent run, asking how he would feel standing on stage pledging his support to Republicans or Democrats.

“I had not before now observed him like this, so unsure of himself and so worried,” she writes.

“He was exhausted, and he threw himself onto the bed, his pink shirt unbuttoned, revealing my favourite parts of his chest, and his blue tie still tied loose around his neck.”

Her worst fear at that moment is that “The Politician's” meeting to endorse Mr Trump could coincide with her appointment to interview the then former president, an adept reader of people and their affairs.

“He might at least clock enough data to wonder, and when the president wondered, he wondered aloud,” she writes.

In the end, their meetings were scheduled a day apart.

As the clock ticked towards the publication of Nuzzi's book, Lizza released his fourth post on his ex. He wrote how last year he found a draft of what would become “American Canto”.

“In hindsight, I believe she wanted me to find it – Olivia once conceded this, though at other times she denied it – and I believe she wanted the world to find out that she and Bobby loved each other,” he said.

Mr Kennedy, who has been married to Cheryl Hines, an actress, for more than a decade, has denied having an affair with Ms Nuzzi.

His spokesman has claimed that he “only met Olivia Nuzzi once in his life for an interview she requested, which yielded a hit piece”.

Mr Sanford, when previously contacted for comment by The Telegraph, did not respond.

            The world's longest and deepest undersea road tunnel is being built in Norway, intended to cut travel time between major cities and become part of a ferry-free highway along its western coast.
    


            The 27-kilometer (17-mile) long tunnel is called Rogfast — short for “Rogaland fastforbindelse,” after the name of the region it's in and the Norwegian word for “fixed link.” At its deepest it will be 392 meters (1,286 feet) below sea level.
    


            Construction started in January 2018 but was halted in late 2019 due to predicted cost overruns that led to the cancellation of existing contracts and a restructuring of the project. Work resumed in late 2021 and the tunnel is now slated for completion in 2033, at a cost of approximately 25 billion Norwegian kroner (about $2.4 billion).
    


            “The tunnel will significantly improve connectivity along the Norwegian west coast, by creating a faster and more reliable link between the Stavanger and Haugesund regions,” said Anne Brit Moen, a project manager at Skanska, the multinational construction company that's building the northern part of the tunnel, which is the deepest section and is 9 kilometers (5.5 miles) long.
    


            By replacing the current ferry connections, Rogfast will reduce travel time between Bergen and Stavanger — respectively the second and fourth largest Norwegian cities by population — by around 40 minutes and make daily commuting much easier, Moen added.
    


            The tunnel will consist of two separate tubes, each with two traffic lanes, designed exclusively for road traffic, and will sport a rather unusual design element roughly halfway through: a double roundabout, 260 meters deep, linking out to a connection tunnel leading to the island of Kvitsøy, Norway's smallest municipality.
    


            Building a tunnel of that length under the sea poses several technological challenges. Like most modern tunnels, to save time, Rogfast is being built from both ends concurrently, with the goal of having the two construction teams meet in the middle within a margin of error of just 5 centimeters (1.97 inches).
    


            Achieving this level of precision requires careful measurements using lasers and other sophisticated equipment. A spinning, mirrored laser scanner measures a newly excavated tunnel portion, collecting 2 million data points per second to create a “digital twin” of the tunnel. That can then to be checked against the design plans for any inaccuracies.
    


            “It's a little bit away from the romantic view of the of the surveyor looking through an eyepiece,” said Burkhard Boeckem, chief technology officer at Hexagon, the company that is providing the measurements for the tunnel.
    


            The 5-centimeter (1.9-inch) margin is among the strictest in the world, but can save time, money, waste, and emissions by avoiding mistakes: “If you deviate from this, you create so much more material that needs to be taken out, and then so much more to be filled in again — it's a lot of whole trucks. So, it's not just a risk factor, but also a very financial factor.”
    


            The Rogfast project is part of a revamp of the E39 coastal highway, a 1,100 kilometer (684-mile) road that runs from Trondheim in the north to Kristiansand in the south. Today it takes 21 hours to drive the entire length of the road, which includes seven ferries. The goal is to make it ferry-free by building tunnels and bridges, cutting travel time in half. Completion is not expected before 2050.
    


            Rogfast is one of the most ambitious and technically demanding components of that plan, and construction hasn't been hurdle-free, according to Moen. “The main challenge so far has been to find good enough grouting methods to seal the rock,” she explained. “We are now 300 meters (984 feet) below sea level, and we have already had quite extensive saltwater leaks in the tunnel system. Since we are going all the way down to 392 meters (1,286 feet) below sea level, we're focusing on finding the best methods to maintain safe and efficient working conditions for everyone.”
    


            The tunnel also requires measures to protect motorists from air pollution. It will employ a longitudinal ventilation system — which typically use jet fans to create airflow — complemented by shaft ventilation extending up to Kvitsøy. “This combination is designed to ensure effective air circulation and safety throughout the tunnel's considerable length,” said Moen.
    


            A real-time incident alert will also be implemented to identify events such as breakdowns or congestion, and cameras and radar will monitor vehicles.
    


            Although jobs would be eventually lost from ferry closures, Rogfast will strengthen access to other jobs, education, and public services for local communities, Moen said, and have positive effects on the local economy and the seafood industry, as logistics costs will go down and companies will be able to operate across a wider area. “The project also creates substantial employment during construction and lays the groundwork for more sustainable and integrated regional development along Norway's fractured western coastline,” she said.
    


            Currently, the title of world's longest tunnel with an undersea section belongs to the Seikan Tunnel in Northern Japan, a railway-only tunnel that has a total length of 53.85 kilometers (33.5 miles), with an undersea section spanning 23.3 kilometers (14.5 miles).
    


            The Channel Tunnel, which is also railway-only and connects England to France, is shorter, at 50.46 kilometers (31.35 miles), but its 37.9 km (23.5-mile) undersea section is longer than Rogfast. Rogfast, however, will be much deeper below sea level than either Seikan or the Channel Tunnel, which bottom out respectively at 240 meters (790 feet), and 115 meters (377 feet).

LONDON, December 2. /TASS/. The European Central Bank (ECB) has refused to provide a backstop for a €140 billion reparations loan to Ukraine underpinned by Russia's immobilized assets, the Financial Times (FT) reported.

The euro-zone regulator concluded that the Ukraine loan proposal put forward by the European Commission (EC) violated its mandate, the British newspaper reported, citing officials.

The officials had asked the ECB whether it could act as a lender of last resort to Euroclear Bank, the lending arm of the Belgium-based central securities depository, to avoid a liquidity crisis, people familiar with the discussions told the FT. ECB officials told the EC this was impossible.

The newspaper cited an internal analysis by the ECB in which the regulator concluded that the EC's initiative was equivalent to providing direct funding to governments, as the central bank would then cover the financial obligations of EU member states. However, this practice is banned in EU treaties as it can result in high inflation and loss of central bank credibility, the FT argued.

Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warned that Russia's response would be very harsh and painful if EU countries use frozen Russian assets to issue a ""reparations loan"" to Ukraine.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW/NEW DELHI, December 2. /TASS/. Proposals for a settlement in Ukraine prepared by US President Donald Trump's administration are a good basis for a final agreement, Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov stated at a briefing for Indian media ahead of the Russia-India summit in New Delhi.

He also noted that Europeans simply want to steal Russian money and spend it on supporting Kiev's ""war machine.""

TASS has summed up the Kremlin representative's key statements.

Russia continues to be ""a crucial energy supplier to India"" at competitive prices: ""And we have no doubt that this trade brings enormous benefits to India and is mutually beneficial at the same time.""

Bilateral relations between Russia and India are based ""on a deep historical experience of mutual understanding, partnership, and a shared vision of world events and a global system based on international law, the rule of law, and the ability to consider each other's interests.""

In its relations with India, Russia is focused on developing bilateral cooperation, protected from external interference: ""What concerns us is how we are going to continue and increase the volume of our bilateral business with India without allowing anyone to interfere in it. And this will certainly be discussed.""

Almost all trade between Russia and India is conducted in national currencies: ""This is very important because in this way we protect our trade, the sovereignty of both countries, Russia and India, and our trade cooperation.""

The Kremlin expects that Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to India ""will be successful.""

Russia expects to increase imports from India, as there is currently an imbalance in trade between the two countries: ""We know that our Indian friends are concerned about this. By the way, we are jointly seeking opportunities to increase imports from India to Russia. We want to buy more from India.""

Russia ""hopes for the continuation"" of cooperation with India in nuclear sector projects.

Russia ""highly values"" India's position on the Ukrainian settlement and New Delhi's readiness to contribute to the search for peace.

The fact that Europeans do not want to listen to Russia on the topic of Ukraine and the absence of dialogue is a problem: ""We are not talking to Europeans. We have no dialogue, not a single word. So how can you know your colleagues' position on such a complex problem if you don't talk to each other? This is our biggest problem.""

European countries are talking about war ""until the last Ukrainian,"" while the Trump administration is ""making enormous efforts"" toward a settlement in Ukraine.

Russia wants peace, but its concerns must be taken into account.

Russia is open to peace negotiations, but the goals set at the beginning of the special military operation must be achieved: ""We must achieve our goals, and we must eliminate the initial reasons for the military operation we started.""

An agreement on a Ukrainian settlement must include the elimination of the causes of the special military operation: ""We want peace. Why don't we conclude a peace agreement immediately? It's very difficult. There were root causes for our president's decision to start the special military operation. And first, we must come to an agreement in a way that eliminates these root causes.""

US mediation on Ukraine is ""very effective.""

Trump's peace plan creates a good basis for agreements on Ukraine: ""Trump's plan is a very good basis for this, and we hope we can adhere to this basis.""

The forthcoming meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US the president's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff will last as long as necessary, Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said.

""No, [the talks between Putin and Witkoff will last] as long as necessary,"" the Kremlin spokesman said, responding to a question about whether a specific time limit is allocated for the meeting according to protocol.

Europeans simply want to steal Russian money and spend it on supporting Kiev's ""war machine"": ""They [Europeans] are discussing the possibility of stealing Russian assets that remain blocked in Europe. That's more than $200 billion.""

Statements by European politicians about a Russian threat are nonsense: ""They [European politicians] say they are afraid of Russia, that Russia is dangerous for Europe. But that's nonsense.""

National currencies are increasingly being used in world trade, while the dollar's share is steadily declining: ""This is not a fast, but a very steady trend that will continue in the coming years.""

Russia, together with other countries, is considering developing alternative payment systems: ""We continue to think together about how to create bilateral or multilateral systems that could become an alternative to systems that can be used as a political tool to put pressure on certain countries.""

Russia remains open to foreign investment, with businesses from various countries showing interest despite the sanctions.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

US defense secretary posted meme depicting beloved children's character aiming rocket launcher at set of boats

Pete Hegseth told US soldiers in Iraq to ignore legal advice on rules of engagement

A post on social media by US defense secretary Pete Hegseth, depicting a beloved children's character aiming a rocket launcher at a cluster of boats, has elicited condemnation from the book's Canadian publisher.

Hegseth's post of the mocked cover of a Franklin the Turtle book titled Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists prompted disbelief and outrage. The image shows a smiling anthropomorphic turtle in military helmet and vest, with a US flag on his arm and a drug-laden boat exploding in the background. “For your Christmas wish list,” Hegseth wrote as the caption.

Hegseth's post came amid growing outrage over a string of deadly US strikes on boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific, which have killed at least 80 people.

The extrajudicial killings received fresh attention last week after Hegseth was reported to have commanded military personnel to “kill everybody” on board vessels after two survivors were spotted after a 2 September strike. The survivors were killed during a second strike.

Hegseth's post, which seemingly mocks a practice that experts have condemned as illegal, was met with frustration by the publisher of Canadian children's book series over his “unauthorized” depictions of its main character.

“Franklin the Turtle is a beloved Canadian icon who has inspired generations of children and stands for kindness, empathy, and inclusivity,” the publisher Kids Can Press wrote in a statement on X.

“We strongly condemn any denigrating, violent, or unauthorized use of Franklin's name or image, which directly contradicts these values,” the publishing house added.

But Hegseth's post also spawned a series of other mock covers, including one that questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election. Others were more critical of the defense secretary, including one post that said: “Book two is Franklin Goes to the Hague.”

With more than 50 titles and 20m copies sold, the Canadian series has eschewed politics, instead pursuing gentle, moral lessons nestled within stories for children – including Franklin Says Sorry, Franklin Forgives and Franklin is Lost.

A television adaptation featured a theme song by Canadian folk singer Bruce Cockburn, whose first explicitly political song If I Had a Rocket Launcher was written after visiting Guatemalan refugee camps during a civil war in which US-backed forces commited a genocide on the country's Indigenous people.

The Pentagon's law of war manual says that people who are “wounded, sick, or shipwrecked” should be “respected and protected in all circumstances” by US forces- and that “making them the object of attack is strictly prohibited”. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats were “conducted in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Release of convicted cocaine trafficker Juan Orlando Hernández is latest US interference in election and comes despite Trump's apparent ‘war on drugs'

Analysis: Trump's pardon of Honduras's ex-president shows counter-drug effort is ‘based on lies and hypocrisy'

A former president of Honduras who was convicted of drug trafficking has walked free from a US prison after receiving a pardon from Donald Trump, as the country's presidential election remained on a knife edge with the US-backed candidate leading by 515 votes.

Juan Orlando Hernández, who was sentenced to 45 years in prison for allegedly creating “a cocaine superhighway to the United States”, was released from a West Virginia prison after Trump's intervention, Hernández's wife confirmed on Tuesday.

It came as Trump steps up his “war on drugs” with airstrikes on alleged traffickers in the Caribbean, and a massive US naval force off the coast of Venezuela.

The pardon was issued amid extraordinary levels of US interference in the Honduran election. Trump threw his support behind Hernández's ally Nasry “Tito” Asfura, saying Washington's support for the country was conditional on an Asfura victory.

On Tuesday, Trump again intervened, alleging without evidence that electoral officials were “trying to change” the result of Sunday's vote and said: “If they do, there will be hell to pay!”

The virtual vote count had been slow and unstable before it was interrupted at about midday on Monday. The electoral council said a technical problem was to blame and insisted the manual count was continuing.

When the release of results was suspended, Asfura was on 39.91%, closely followed by another rightwing candidate, Salvador Nasralla, on 39.89%. Rixi Moncada, the candidate for the leftwing ruling party, was trailing in a distant third place with 19.16% of the vote.

As election officials pleaded for patience, Hernández's wife, Ana García de Hernández, disclosed that the former president had been released from a US prison.

“God is faithful and never fails! Yesterday, Monday 1 December 2025, we lived a day we will never forget. After almost four years of pain, waiting and difficult trials, my husband, Juan Orlando Hernández, became a free man AGAIN, thanks to the presidential pardon granted by President Donald Trump,” she wrote.

Axios reported that in a letter to Trump in October, Hernández had claimed that he had been “targeted by the Biden-Harris administration not for any wrongdoing, but for political reasons.”

US authorities had investigated Hernández for years before he was indicted; his brother, Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández, was arrested in 2018 and convicted in 2019, during Trump's first term.

Manhattan prosecutors accused the former president of allegedly receiving $1m from the former Mexican cartel kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán in 2013 for his first presidential campaign, and alleged that, under Hernández's government, Honduras served as a crucial transit point for cocaine coming from South American countries including Colombia and Venezuela.

Hernández had been held at the federal Hazelton prison in West Virginia and is now in a “safe place”, according to his wife.

Trump's pardon has baffled many observers, who have questioned why the US president has used his antinarcotics campaign to justify overthrowing Venezuela's dictator, Nicolás Maduro, while simultaneously freeing a man convicted of such crimes.

In Honduras, the pardon has been viewed as yet another attempt by the US president to interfere in the election.

Honduras's deputy foreign minister, Gerardo Torres Zelaya, posted that the US “got involved in our elections” and “freed the worst narco and criminal in our history”.

During the campaign, Moncada accused Trump of “interventionism” and of “imperial, direct foreign interference” in the electoral process. She served as finance minister under the current president, Xiomara Castro, who could not run again because presidential mandates are limited to a single term.

Before the election, Trump had claimed Moncada was a communist and that her victory would hand the country to “Maduro and his narco-terrorists”.

Nasralla, an experienced politician and TV host who served as Castro's vice-president before breaking away to launch his own presidential attempt, was labelled by Trump as a “borderline communist” who was running only to split the vote between Moncada and Asfura. Gustavo Irías, a co-founder and executive director of Honduras's Centre of Study for Democracy, said Trump's “interference definitely influenced the outcome” of the elections.

“Those messages from Trump validated a political party that was practically unable to win because of its long history of links to drug trafficking and corruption – and that suffered a massive defeat in 2021,” he said, referring to Castro's wide victory over Asfura in the last presidential election.

A similar strategy was adopted by the US president in October during Argentina's midterm elections, when Trump announced a $40bn bailout conditional on the victory of the far-right president Javier Milei's party.

“So people went to vote here under pressure, under fear,” Irías said.

The electoral council has up to 30 days to announce the result.

For many, the suspension of the vote counts has revived traumatic memories of the 2017 election, when Hernández ran for a second term, after a court struck down a constitutional ban on re-election.

Early results showed Nasralla ahead, but after a “blackout” – marked by violent protests in which dozens were killed – Hernández emerged ahead and, a week after the election, was recognised by the US as the winner.

Now, after a campaign in which virtually all the candidates alleged electoral fraud, all three contenders have voiced concern over the delay.“Let's not keep the country waiting on edge,” said Asfura.

Irías said that official results could take weeks to be finalised and that, given everything unfolding in this election, “we are going to see a continuation of governments with low legitimacy”.

“I hope the system does not return with completely different figures from those with which the count was halted, as happened in 2017, because that could open up a new and very serious crisis,” he added.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The legislature yesterday passed a NT$27 billion (US$858.92 million) special budget with no dissenters to rebuild parts of Hualien County battered by flooding in September from a breach of a barrier lake on the Mataian River in Hualien County.

The budget cleared the legislature with the initially proposed NT$27 billion in funding from 2025 to 2030 intact. There is a NT$3 billion reserve on top of that permitted under the NT$30 billion ceiling set by a special reconstruction act approved by the legislature on Oct. 31.

The Sept. 23 flooding, triggered as Typhoon Ragasa's outer bands passed over the region, inundated parts of Guangfu Township (光復) and nearby areas.

The special act was designed to fast-track long-term recovery, with NT$19.2 billion earmarked for economic development; NT$5.6 billion for community development and environmental protection; NT$1.5 billion for contingency funding; and NT$600 million for general administration.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that NT$8.5 billion would go to water resource and river management projects, with a focus on dredging and clearing debris in the short term to improve drainage.

Long-term plans include building fortified levees capable of withstanding debris flows, the ministry said.

Other major projects include repairing damaged bridges; reinforcing slopes; rebuilding agricultural and public infrastructure; supporting temporary housing; and reinforcing the power grid, it said.

Funding for special budgets is to be raised through government borrowing.

Lawmakers also approved supplementary resolutions.

One, proposed by Taiwan People's Party lawmakers, requires Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰) to deliver a special report to the legislature within two months on issues such as barrier-dam safety, upstream sediment removal, river-basin treatment plans and funds use.

A joint committee meeting completed a preliminary review of the budget on Nov. 19, while cross-party negotiations chaired by Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜) on Wednesday last week cleared the way for the bill's final passage yesterday.

The experts made the remarks after President William Lai (賴清德) told a news conference on Wednesday that his administration would introduce a NT$1.25 trillion (US$39.8 billion) special defense budget bill to boost Taiwan's overall defense posture over the next eight years.
Lai said that Beijing aims for military unification of Taiwan by 2027. The Presidential Office later clarified that what Lai meant was that China's goal is to “prepare for military unification

Ely Ratner, who served as assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs from 2021 to this year, said in a CNA interview that Takaichi's comments on Taiwan simply reflected Japan's position and stance on Taiwan.
On Nov. 7, the Japanese prime minister commented in a parliamentary session that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could constitute “a situation threatening Japan's survival” that could trigger a military

Bureau Director-General Lin Fu-shan (林福山) said the government started TPass 2.0 to offer rebates to frequent riders of public transportation, or people who use city buses, highway buses, trains or MRTs at least 11 times per month.

Hello, this is Chris York, reporting from Kyiv on day 1,378 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

While the international focus remains on Trump's peace deal negotiations in Moscow, our focus in this blog is on updates from the front:

Our top story so far:

Drones launched by Ukraine's military intelligence struck Russian air defense systems in occupied Donbas, the agency claimed on Dec. 2, knocking out a launcher from a S-300 SAM system, and two 1L125 Niobium-SV radar stations.

""Such strikes significantly reduce the ability of Muscovites to control the airspace over Donbas and create conditions for new air operations of the Defense Forces of Ukraine,"" HUR said in a post on Telegram.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report.

Ukraine expects up to $16 billion of U.S. weapons in 2026, provided under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), Aliona Hetmanchuk, the head of Ukraine's mission to NATO said on Dec. 2.

The PURL initiative, launched earlier this year, enables NATO allies to buy advanced U.S. weaponry for Ukraine.

""It is very important for us that the end of 2025 does not become the end of the program. Next year, we expect to ensure the supply of American weapons worth $12 to $16 billion,"" Hetmanchuk said in comments reported by Ukrainska Pravda.

Last updated 2:21 p.m. Kyiv time.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained British citizen Ross David Cutmore, who came to Ukraine as a military instructor, on suspicion of working for Russian intelligence, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 2.

The security agency announced Cutmore's detention on Oct. 29 without disclosing his name at the time, presenting him as a ""former military instructor"" from Europe who was covertly working for Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) from Kyiv.

A number of foreign veterans have flocked to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022 to serve as instructors or volunteers in the Ukrainian military.

Cutmore, reportedly a former British soldier who was deployed in the Middle East, arrived in Ukraine in early 2024 to train Ukrainian soldiers in the use of firearms and tactical skills.

Several months later, the military trainer left the job and reached out to Russian intelligence services with an offer of collaboration, seeking ""easy money,"" the SBU said in October.

According to the investigation, Cutmore was passing information on Ukraine's military to Russia and was plotting unspecified ""terrorist attacks."" The suspect is in custody and faces up to 12 years in prison.

A Russian oil tanker reportedly came under a drone attack in the Black Sea while en route to a port in northern Turkey on Dec. 2, according to Turkish authorities.

""The tanker MIDVOLGA-2, carrying sunflower oil from Russia to Georgia, reported being attacked 80 miles off our coast,"" the Turkish Transport Ministry wrote on X on Dec. 2. ""Currently, there are no casualties among the 13 crew members, and the vessel has not requested assistance. The ship is proceeding toward Sinop under its own power.""

According to Marine Traffic, an online ship-tracking platform, the Midvolga-2 is an oil and chemical tanker just under 140 meters long and sails under the Russian flag.

Citing unnamed Turkish officials, Bloomberg reported that the Midvolga-2 was struck by sea drones.

Eighty miles would be outside Turkey's territorial waters but well within its Exclusive Economic Zone.

There has been no confirmation or even official mention of Ukraine in connection to the attack on the Midvolga-2, but it follows a series of recent Ukrainian strikes on Russia's “shadow fleet” — vessels that skirt sanctions to sell Russian fossil fuels abroad. These strikes have typically used “Sea Baby” naval drones.

At least six people were killed and 24 others injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine from the evening of Nov. 30 to the morning of Dec. 1, according to authorities.

Ukraine's Air Force said Dec. 1 that Russia launched 62 strike drones of various types, including Shahed-type drones, from several directions in Russia and occupied Crimea. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 39 of them, while 20 drones hit eight locations.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a Russian ballistic missile struck Dnipro industrial area on Dec. 1, killing four people and injuring 45 others, local authorities said. A further two people were injured in drone strikes later in the day.

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, one person was killed and three injured, Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.

In Sumy Oblast, one person was killed and another injured when a drone struck a car in the Bilopil community, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration said.

In Kharkiv Oblast, six civilians were injured as Russian forces attacked six settlements over the past day, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram.

In Kherson Oblast, 13 people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Telegram.

Russia has lost about 1,173,920 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Dec. 1.

The figure includes 1,110 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day, according to the report.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,387 tanks, 23,679 armored fighting vehicles, 68,641 vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,768 artillery systems, 1,552 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,253 air defense systems, 430 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 86,141 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares.  Help us reach 25,000 members by the end of 2025.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Dec. 2 that Moscow is prepared for a war with Europe ""right now"" if European states initiate one, delivering the remarks moments before meeting U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.

""If Europe starts a war, we are ready right now,"" the Russian president said.

Putin's comments came as Washington intensifies diplomatic outreach aimed at advancing negotiations to end Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. 

The Russian president claimed that European governments obstruct U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to reach a settlement and ""live under illusions"" of imposing a strategic defeat on Russia.

Putin also said Europe ""has no peaceful agenda"" and ""is on the side of war,"" citing military support for Ukraine and the crafting of peace proposals less favorable to Russia as evidence of hostility.

""When they supposedly try to make changes to Trump's proposals… all these changes are aimed at only one thing: to completely block the entire peace process,"" the Russian president added.

The remarks echoed Moscow's broader messaging as Russia expands hybrid pressure on Europe.

European states have recorded a surge of suspected Russian-linked activities in recent years, including cyberattacks, sabotage attempts, and repeated damage to underwater infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.  

The incidents intensified in early autumn as unidentified drones and Russian aircraft repeatedly crossed into or approached NATO airspace.

In September, Polish forces shot down several Russian drones that entered Polish territory. Days later, a Russian drone breached Romanian airspace, though Bucharest did not engage. 

On Sept. 19, three Russian MiG-31 fighters crossed into Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes, prompting Tallinn to activate consultations under NATO's Article 4.

Belgium also reported a series of drone incidents near critical infrastructure. Belgian authorities said three drones flew over the Doel Nuclear Power Plant on Nov. 9, while several unidentified drones were spotted near sensitive sites in the days that followed.

Putin's latest warning added pressure to European capitals already concerned about Russia's increasing willingness to test air defenses and target infrastructure across the continent.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained British citizen Ross David Cutmore, who came to Ukraine as a military instructor, on suspicion of working for Russian intelligence, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 2.



Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Witkoff will present Putin with the latest version of the U.S.-Ukraine framework drafted during recent rounds of talks in Geneva and Florida.

""Ukraine approaches all diplomatic efforts with utmost seriousness – we are committed to achieving a real peace and guaranteed security,"" Zelensky said.

According to Ukraine's national ""Children of War"" database, at least 19,546 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and taken to Russia or Russian-controlled areas since February 2022.

""All of this is done exclusively for Western audiences and to raise the stakes in diplomacy,"" said Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation. 

The latest incident occurred on Nov. 30, when Vilnius International Airport suspended operations after unidentified objects — believed to be balloons — appeared in nearby airspace. 

Russian forces captured about 505 square kilometers (195 square miles) of Ukrainian territory in November, almost twice the gains recorded in September, DeepState said in an assessment Dec. 1. 

""The informational 'victories' that the Russian Defense Ministry  announces daily on paper have nothing to do with the real situation on the front lines,"" Ukraine's 11th Army Corps said.

Laurentian Bank has struck a deal with Fairstone and National Bank after having launched an unsuccessful bid to attract a buyer in 2024.Christinne Muschi/The Canadian Press

Laurentian Bank of Canada LB-T has struck an agreement to be taken over by Fairstone Bank of Canada in an all-cash deal valued at $1.9-billion while also selling its retail business to National Bank of Canada NA-T as part of the lender's strategy to restructure its beleaguered operations. 

Montreal-based Fairstone will combine its commercial lending unit with Laurentian's in a bid to expand its market share. The sale, announced early Tuesday, follows years of efforts at Laurentian to turn around its business as it grappled with waning profits while its revenue flatlined and costs jumped. 

Fairstone will acquire all common shares of Laurentian at $40.50 per share. The deal is at a premium of 20 per cent over the price of Laurentian shares' close as of Monday, the banks said. 

“We view Quebec as a key market and are excited to continue building our presence with the expertise we're acquiring from Laurentian Bank,” Fairstone chief executive officer Scott Wood said in a statement. 

Laurentian Bank reports $37.5-million in third-quarter profit, drop in revenue

Laurentian Bank will maintain its brand and head office in Montreal. Laurentian CEO Éric Provost will continue in his role and will continue to oversee Laurentian's turnaround plan.

Laurentian will concentrate on its remaining business in commercial real estate lending, inventory and equipment financing, and capital markets. 

“Joining forces with Fairstone Bank will allow us to grow our specialized commercial business even further,” Mr. Provost said in a statement. 

National Bank of Canada will purchase Laurentian's retail and small and medium-sized enterprises banking books, as well as its syndicated loan portfolio. 

As of July 31, Laurentian's retail loans and deposit books were about $3.3-billion and $7.6-billion, respectively. Its small and medium-sized enterprises loans and deposits were about $800-million and $600-million. 

“Leveraging our strong presence in Quebec, this transaction aligns with our domestic growth strategy and is a natural fit,” National Bank CEO Laurent Ferreira said. 

The purchase will modestly boost National's retail and small and medium-sized enterprises loans by 2.5 per cent and retail deposits by 6 per cent, according to Bank of Nova Scotia analyst Mike Rizvanovic. 

The deal builds on a string of Canadian bank acquisitions in recent years, two of which involved Fairstone and National. 

In February, National bought Canadian Western Bank to accelerate the lender's reach into Western provinces in a deal valued at $5-billion. A month earlier, billionaire financier Stephen Smith had closed a deal to merge Home Trust Co. with Fairstone Bank of Canada. 

Other recent bank deals included Royal Bank of Canada's 2022 purchase HSBC Bank Canada. 

Laurentian's sale will leave EQB Inc., the parent company of EQ Bank, as the final smaller publicly traded Canadian bank outside of the six largest lenders. 

In May, 2024, Laurentian launched a plan to overhaul and streamline its business after a sale process in 2023 failed to attract a buyer. The updated strategy – the third turnaround plan in less than a decade – was launched after a multiday system outage prevented customers from accessing their accounting, which was followed by the sudden ousting of its CEO. 

The plan was aimed at further simplifying its businesses and cutting costs by focusing on the areas where the bank believed it could compete against the larger lenders. That included growing its commercial banking business, rejigging its personal banking unit to boost its deposit base and updating its digital and technology platforms. 

But the bank has made tepid progress over the past year. In its third quarter results released in August, loan growth was flat, dragged down by lower demand for personal loans and inventory financing. 

Analysts and investors have been closely watching Laurentian's efficiency ratio – a key metric of productivity that measures expenses as a percentage of revenues. In August, the lender posted a worsening adjusted efficiency ratio of 75.7 per cent, an increase from the same period a year earlier and well above Laurentian's 60-per-cent medium-term target. 

Laurentian does not report results for its individual businesses, but some analysts speculate that its personal banking unit has continued to struggle. 

“Although not disclosed, we believe the Canadian retail business has likely been unprofitable for some time due to its inability to reach sufficient scale,” Raymond James analyst Stephen Boland said in a note to clients. 

Despite the headwinds, Laurentian was making some headway on boosting its deposit base, and it expected demand for inventory financing to pick up in the new year. 

Its common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio – a measure of a lender's ability to absorb losses – had edged higher to 11.3 per cent, well above the minimum level required by Canada's banking regulator and providing it with ample room to ramp up lending. 

After the deals close, Laurentian will shutter its branches in Quebec. The bank has 57 retail locations and more than 2,700 employees – although it is not clear how many of those staff work in branches. 

Its employees will not be transferred to National. Instead, Laurentian's affected staff will be able to apply for open roles at National. 

Jefferies analyst John Aiken said the deal allows National to increase scale in its home province without having to manage the issues in Laurentian's branch system. It is also buying the assets, deposits and mutual funds at book value. 

“Laurentian's elegant exit is National's gain,” Mr. Aiken said in a note to clients. 

Laurentian “faced an uphill climb against its competitors with greater scale, product and service capabilities, and efficiency, and the takeout of the bank was the logical, inevitable conclusion, albeit, much sooner than expected.” 

Laurentian has been in a state of flux for several years. Weeks after the bank called off its sale process in September, 2023, its computer systems crashed during a planned technology upgrade. This led to the termination of CEO Rania Llewellyn, the first woman to run a major Canadian-based bank, while she was halfway through a three-year strategic review. 

In 2020, former CEO François Desjardins was abruptly ousted after the bank terminated an overhaul of its digital systems and branch network. 

Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, which holds about 8 per cent of Laurentian's shares, said it has agreed to vote in favour of the acquisition, subject to certain conditions. The transactions are expected to close by late 2026. 

Shares of Laurentian surged 18 per cent and National's stock rose 1.5 per cent early Tuesday afternoon in Toronto.

Scotiabank reported fourth-quarter earnings of $2.2-billion, or $1.65 per share, on Monday.Chris Wattie/Reuters

Bank of Nova Scotia BNS-T reported higher fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates as activity in capital markets and wealth management surged, offsetting a restructuring charge aimed at cutting costs.

Scotiabank earned $2.2-billion, or $1.65 per share, in the three months ended Oct.31. That compared with $1.69-billion, or $1.22 per share, in the same quarter last year. 

Adjusted to exclude certain items, including a restructuring charge and severance provisions, the bank said it earned $1.93 per share. That edged out the $1.84 per share analysts expected, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. 

“We delivered improving results through the year as we strengthened our balance sheet, improved our loan-to-deposit ratio, and increased return on equity,” Scotiabank chief executive officer Scott Thomson said in a statement. 

The bank kept its quarterly dividend unchanged at $1.10 per share. 

Scotiabank is the first major bank to release earnings for the three months ended Oct. 31. Royal Bank of Canada RY-T and National Bank of Canada NA-T will report results on Wednesday. Toronto-Dominion Bank TD-T, Bank of Montreal BMO-T, and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CM-T will wrap up earnings week on Thursday. 

In the quarter, Scotiabank set aside $1.1-billion in provisions for credit losses – the funds banks set aside to cover loans that may default – and included $71-million against loans that are still being repaid, based on models that use economic forecasting to predict future losses. 

In the same quarter last year, Scotiabank set aside $1.03-billion in provisions. 

Total revenue rose 15 per cent in the quarter to $9.8-billion. But expenses increased 10 per cent to $5.8-billion, which the bank said was driven by higher personnel costs, technology and business development. 

Profit from Canadian banking was $941-million, up 1 per cent from a year earlier, driven by higher private equity gains, mutual fund distribution fees and insurance income. Loan balances were up 2 per cent year over year. 

Profit from the bank's international division was up 6 per cent to $634-million. 

The global wealth management division generated $447-million of profit, up 18 per cent. And capital markets profit jumped 50 per cent to $519-million on stronger activity in the United States.

Young CDU lawmakers threatened to tank the reform, putting strain on the coalition. A final vote comes Friday. Meanwhile, an AfD councillor has been kicked out of the party for a speech he gave. DW has the latest.

For the latest news, analysis and background on this and other headlines from Germany on Tuesday, December 2, keep reading: 

Police in Germany made three arrests after raiding eight apartments and brothels in the states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony and Baden-Württemberg on Tuesday.

The raids targeted Chinese gangs illegally smuggling women into German to work as prostitutes.

Two Chinese nationals (aged 32 and 41) and a German (aged 59) were arrested, though police say two more individuals are also being sought. 

The Chinese suspects are accused of having set up their business with Chinese prostitutes and operated it in Germany since at least August 2024. The ring operates at 75 sites in 14 states say authorities.

Using more than 160 cellphone numbers, the Chinese gang set up over 1,100 ads on online erotic platforms to drum up business at rented vacation homes and construction containers. 

The German is accused of being a driver for the gang and for occasionally renting apartments for it.

Some 280 officers took part in Tuesday's raids. These turned up numerous electronic devices and passports.

Authorities say the women involved did not have proper working papers. They are thought to have willingly entered into prostitution in order to split profits with the gang say federal police.

It is unclear how many women may be involved. 

The five individuals under investigation are accused of running an illegal smuggling operation, welfare fraud and tax evasion. 

AFP and dpa news agencies are reporting that a majority of CDU/CSU parliamentarians voted in favor of a proposed pension package that several young conservatives threatened to torpedo.

Citing participants in a closed-door practice vote, the package is said to have garnered overwhelming support.

The exact number of no votes and abstentions is not known, though media reported perhaps 15 no votes and a number of abstentions. 

A final vote will be held on Friday. Anyone intending to vote against the package has been told by party whips to notify leadership by noon Thursday. 

In an effort to avoid a situation like this July's judicial appointment debacle, the vote will not be anonymous.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz faces potential rebellion from within.

The leader of his conservative CDU party's youth organization, Johannes Winkel, heads a group of 18 young MPs unwilling to sign off on a pension reform that would shift an additional more than €100 billion ($116 billion) in pension costs onto the shoulders of the young.

So far there are mixed signals. Both sides know this is now more of a vote about the stability of Merz' coalition with the center-left SPD than anything else. Still, the rebels insist this is about whether Germany is capable of meaningful reform rather than continuing to throw money at a political problem that has been talked about for decades.

The stakes are high. Too high to fail the chancellor over this. But the political price will be high for Merz. The chancellor may find himself having to make promises to his young MPs with growing doubt over whether he will be able to keep them.

The coalition with the SPD was always going to be tough. The concepts over what the welfare state should deliver to whom are miles apart. 

But there simply is no political alternative in the center. A failure to bridge that gap would amount to helping the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) get a major step ahead in their growing determination to hold power. 

The leader of the CDU parliamentary party, Jens Spahn, has called on a group of young conservative lawmakers who oppose the government's proposed pensions package to drop their objections and vote ""yes"" at a parliamentary vote on Friday.

Spahn said that the leadership of the conservative CDU/CSU parliamentary bloc expected that the package would receive a clear majority at a test vote among the parliamentary group held on Tuesday.

""And if that is the case, there is a clear expectation that those who see the matter differently vote together with the bloc,"" he said.

He said he respected the youth group for voicing their criticism.

""The message that reforms are necessary has been put across,"" he said.

But he warned that the stability of the coalition government would be put in jeopardy if the pensions package were not approved.

""Germany needs a stable coalition,"" he said.

The youth group has claimed that the pensions package as it stands, which would lock in pensions at 48% of the average income until 2031, would overburden future generations.

The western city of Cologne, Germany's third-largest in terms of population, will play the leading role in the Rhine-Ruhr region's bid to host the Olympics in 2036, 2040 or 2044, North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) state premier Hendrik Wüst said on Tuesday.

Wüst made his remarks after meeting with representatives of the municipalities involved in the bid in Düsseldorf, the state capital.

""We are offering Germany and the world the most compact, sustainable and spectacular Olympic Games. The strongest bid for the Olympic Games comes from us,"" he said.

""At the moment, we assume that we will be able to offer around 14 million tickets. An absolute record,"" Wüst said.

Among other things, the athletics stadium would be built in Cologne as a temporary facility, parts of which will later be used for other purposes. 

Wüst said the Olympic Village — which would offer accommodation for around 95% of athletes — would also be located in Cologne. 

Other sports venues would be spread across other municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia.  

The German Olympics body, DOSB, plans to decide in the third quarter of 2026 which city or region will bid and for which Summer Games, with Berlin, Hamburg and Munich also in the running.

North Rhine-Westphalia is to hold a referendum on April 19 on whether its Rhine-Ruhr region should move forward with the bid, after Munich residents recently voted in favor.

Germany on Tuesday unveiled a new drone defense unit of the federal police, a move that comes after the country, along with other European states, recently experienced a spate of drone incursions widely blamed on Russia.

The federal police unit will have ""a clear mandate to detect, defend, intercept and, if necessary, shoot down drones,"" Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said at a ceremony near Berlin.

""We cannot accept that hybrid threats using drones remain a danger to our security,"" he added.

Dobrindt said that the new unit would ultimately be staffed by more than 130 officers and that Germany would be investing more than €100 million ($116 million) in anti-drone technology over the coming year.

He said a new joint drone defense center, which will coordinate responses between federal police, local authorities and the military, is also likely to be announced this week.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) forecast on Tuesday that the German economy will experience slight growth in 2025 before growing by 1% next year.

The OECD said it predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will inch up by 0.3% this year, rising to 1% in 2026 and 1.5% in 2027.

The 2026 figure represents a 0.1 percentage point downward revision of the OECD's forecast in September.

""Private consumption will increase due to low inflation, rising nominal wages and decreasing domestic policy uncertainty,"" the OECD said.

In comparison, GDP across the OECD countries as a whole is expected to grow by 3.2% this year, slowing to 2.9% in 2026 before climbing back up to 3.1% in 2027. 

The picture presented by the OECD is rosier than that put forward earlier in the day by the Federation of German Industries (BDI), whose president, Peter Leibinger, spoke of Germany's industrial sector being in ""free fall,"" as noted in a previous entry.

 

A delivery truck carrying ammunition for a Bundeswehr barracks in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt was robbed last week, German media has reported.

Almost 2,000 rounds were missing when the delivery arrived.

The Defense Ministry has confirmed the theft and said the delivery driver is to blame for taking an unplanned stop.

A spokesperson for the ministry confirmed that ammunition had been ""lost"" and spoke of a ""very serious incident"" that was ""exceptional in its scope."" The ammunition had been transported in a civilian vehicle. 

The German Armed Forces have 1,500 properties, and a large amount of freight has to be transported every day. The Bundeswehr cannot handle all of this themselves, and use of civilian transport vehicles is ""quite common,"" the ministry added.

The contracted companies need to be qualified and must meet certain requirements. Which requirements were apparently not met in this case is now part of the investigation being conducted by Jerichoer Land police and the public prosecutor's office. 

The Bundeswehr is however partially involved in the investigation — including the military intelligence service MAD, as well as the security officer on site, and military police for the forensic investigation. 

The spokesperson did not comment on where the truck with the ammunition came from — directly from a private company or another location. However, the destination was the logistics site in the town of Burg.

For the full story, read DW's report on the Bundeswehr ammunition theft.

Media outlet RTL Deutschland is to make large job cuts as it carries out a restructuring program to adapt to a challenging economic environment, its CEO, Stephan Schmitter, told the DPA news agency on Tuesday.

He said around 600 positions would disappear, including both full-time and part-time roles.

Schmitter said the broadcaster needed to restructure to adapt both to profound changes in the media market and the difficult economic situation but insisted that the restructuring would be ""as socially responsible, respectful and transparent as possible.""

Among other things, a special severance program has been developed to support employees who lose their jobs, he said.

""The social plan we negotiated with the works council is intended to avoid redundancies as much as possible,"" he said, saying that mitigation measures included phased retirement and severance payments.

Both the ongoing recession and weak TV advertising markets have put pressure on private broadcasters in Germany, with linear TV advertising revenues in Germany falling by more than 20% since 2019.

RTL Deutschland is part of the international RTL Group, Europe's largest commercial broadcasting group. In Germany, the company operates the RTL, ntv and Vox channels as well as streaming service RTL+.

Germany's economy, Europe's biggest, is undergoing the ""deepest crisis"" in postwar history, an industry group has warned, while calling for urgent action from the conservative-led coalition government.

The president of the Federation of German Industries, Peter Leibinger, said the economy was ""in free fall, but the federal government is not responding decisively enough.""

""Germany now needs an economic policy turnaround with clear priorities for competitiveness and growth,"" he said.

The BDI warned that the situation was ""not a temporary economic dip, but a structural decline"" and predicted a fall in industrial production for a fourth consecutive year in 2025.

The German economy has faced a slew of major challenges in recent years, ranging from high energy costs and reduced demand for its exports to growing economic rivalry with China and the unpredictable tariffs coming from Washington.

These have led to two years of recession, with meager growth predicted in 2025 as well.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz of the right-wing Christian Democrats (CDU) has vowed to revive the economy but has faced increasing criticism that his government has undertaken too little in this regard in the six months since taking office.

German chocolate production reached 12.8 kilos per person in 2024, according to the Federal Statistics Office (Destatis).

That's equivalent to two and a half 100g bars of chocolate per person every week.

However, this did not mean that Germans were feasting on all this chocolate. Some 981,400 tonnes were exported, with only 525,400 being imported.

This left consumption at around 614,000 tons.

Of the imported chocolate, Belgian was the favorite, accounting for around a quarter of imports.

A large share of exports were also destined for neighboring countries, with France (12.3%), Poland (9.9%) and the UK (9.4%) being the biggest consumers of German chocolate.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has removed a council member from its faction in the west German town of Herford after he gave a speech at the AfD youth organization's founding congress on Saturday that was reminiscent of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.

The party was trying to set up a new youth organization, Generation Germany, after the previous one was labelled as confirmed extremist by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV).

The event was also met with thousands of protesters.

Alexander Eichwald, an unknown newcomer to the party, took to the stage calling to his ""party comrades,"" saying: ""We share our love and loyalty to Germany here together.""

Emphasizing the trilled R pronunciation that conjures images of Hitler, the 30-year-old continued, ""it is and remains our national duty to protect German culture from foreign influences,"" sparking boos from the crowd.

His local branch of the party is now looking to expel him.

The BfV for the state of Thuringia has reportedly already started looking into the new youth organization as potentially right-wing extremist.

Stephen Kramer, president of the local BfV office, said that it was not just a single speech that was driving the investigation, but rather all the speeches and contributions.

""Ethnic nationalism and allusions and parallels to the guiding principles of the Hitler Youth are some of the points of reference here,"" Kramer told RND newspaper network.

Like many Western European countries, Germany has an aging population that needs to be cared for in retirement, but who also make up a key voting bloc, especially for the two main coalition parties — SPD and CDU.

The parties had agreed to a pension reform in their coalition agreement that would lock in pensions at 48% of the average income until 2031.

Another key aspect is the introduction of the ""active pension"" that aims to encourage pensioners to keep working voluntarily.

But it is the cost of the pensions that has created a fracture within the coalition government, with the 18 members of CDU/CSU youth group in the Bundestag threatening to vote against the reform. The government only has a 12-seat majority.

The plan to keep pensions in line with incomes is expected to cost the state €11 billion ($12.77 billion) by 2031 and up to €15 billion a year after that if the pinned rate increases, which is what the SPD wants.

The coalition has refused to make changes to the reform to appease the rebellious lawmakers, but Merz has offered a discussion on even deeper reforms for the pension system after 2031.

On Monday, the CDU/CSU youth group continued to say it could not vote in favor of the bill, but stopped short of a full rebellion, saying that each member could vote independently.

On Tuesday, the conservative parliamentary group is set to discuss the legislation and hold a test vote to see if they have the numbers ahead of Friday's real vote.

SPD's co-leader Bärbel Bas has said that a failed vote then could stall all further legislation and threaten Merz's government.

Good morning from rainy Bonn!

Tuesday looks set to be a deciding day for the future of Germany's coalition government with the CDU/CSU holding a test vote on a pension reform package. 

A lack of necessary votes could undermine the government and further fracture the coalition.

The Bundestag will also hold a memorial hour for the victims of the Paris attacks ten years ago.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

About 7,000 workers have already been cut from the agency, leading to understaffed field offices and overwhelmed phones.

The Trump administration is reportedly looking to dramatically reduce the number of people who visit Social Security field offices across the United States, a plan that Democratic lawmakers warned is yet another scheme to disrupt and ultimately cut benefits.

Nextgov/FCW viewed internal Social Security Administration (SSA) planning documents showing that the agency is aiming for “no more than 15 million total” in-person visits to field offices in fiscal year 2026 — half the level of the prior fiscal year.

“Under Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano, the agency is aiming to push people to interact with Social Security online instead of going to a field office or calling the agency, although Bisignano told lawmakers in June that, even with his focus on technology, the agency is not ‘getting rid of field offices,' despite reports of planned closures,” Nextgov/FCW reported Monday.

One anonymous SSA staffer told the outlet that agency leadership wants “fewer people in the front door and they want all work that doesn't require direct customer interactions to be centralized.”

“They appear to be quietly killing field offices,” the staffer said.

The plan comes after the Trump administration carried out the largest staffing cut in SSA history, cutting the agency's workforce by around 7,000. The cut left one SSA worker for every 1,480 beneficiaries, resulting in understaffed field offices and overwhelmed phone operations.

Beneficiaries have also repeatedly faced issues this year attempting to access the Social Security website, problems that SSA's plan to curb field office visits could exacerbate.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), one of the lawmakers spearheading a probe into Bisignano's questionable tenure at the fintech company Fiserv, said in response to the new reporting that “this sure sounds like another way to make it even harder for Americans to get the benefits they've earned.”

In a social media post on Monday, Warren highlighted testimony from seniors who have faced long wait times and other difficulties while seeking assistance from SSA under Bisignano's leadership:

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, told Nextgov/FCW that “between staffing reductions, more restrictive documentation requirements for Americans to get assistance on the phones, and rapid reorganization of offices around the country, it's difficult to see how” SSA's goal of slashing visits to field offices “will lead to anything other than worse service and more challenges at Social Security.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","First on CNN: DHS recommends travel ban list include at least 10 more countries following DC shooting","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/politics/dhs-travel-ban-countries","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:46:55 GMT","


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is recommending that the Trump administration's travel ban list include between 30 to 32 countries, marking an increase from the current list of 19 countries, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            Nationals of countries on the travel ban list face restrictions on travel to the United States. The source said the list could continue to expand based on ongoing assessments, but it is unclear which countries are being added to the list — and when they'll be announced.
    


            The recommendation to the White House comes on the heels of the shooting in Washington, DC, that killed one National Guard member and critically wounded another.
    


            The shooting suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who previously worked with the US in Afghanistan, resettling in Washington state under the Biden administration and then being granted asylum under the Trump administration.
    


            Noem said Monday that, following a meeting with President Donald Trump, she recommended a “full travel ban” on “every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”
    


            The current list of 19 countries with full or partial restrictions include Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.
    


            Trump has previously said that some countries had “deficient” screening for passports and other public documents or have historically refused to take back their own citizens.
    


            The Trump administration has also ramped up its immigration crackdown, citing the shooting in Washington, DC. Senior Trump administration officials have accused the Biden administration of insufficiently vetting the suspect and argued the current immigration system needs to be overhauled.
    


            Last week, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that it will reexamine all green cards issued to people from the 19 countries currently facing full or partial travel restrictions.
    


            The agency's director, Joe Edlow, also announced updated guidance that authorizes USCIS officers “to consider country-specific factors as significant negative factors when reviewing immigration requests.”
    


            The same day, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, said the administration was also reviewing all asylum cases that were approved under former President Joe Biden.
    


            A day later, Edlow announced the US was pausing all asylum decisions “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”
    


            Trump has also threatened to “permanently pause” migration from what he called “third-world countries,” without specifying which countries he was referring to — a move Noem defended on Sunday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Injured National Guard member remains in serious condition, but shows ‘positive' signs","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/us/national-guard-andrew-wolfe","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 12:53:42 GMT","


            Andrew Wolfe, the 24-year-old National Guard member who was injured in an ambush-style shooting in Washington, DC, last Wednesday, remains in serious condition but has shown “positive” signs of recovery, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said.
    


            “My biggest message is Andrew is still fighting for his life,” Morrisey said at a news conference on Monday.
    


            The governor said his office was told that when a nurse asked Wolfe to give a thumbs up if he could hear, “he did respond.”
    


            “And we were told that he also wiggled his toes, so we take that as a positive sign,” Morrisey added. Wolfe's parents have asked for continued prayers as their son fights to recover, he said.
    


Wolfe, a US Air Force staff sergeant, was shot and injured while deployed to Washington, DC, as part of the Trump administration's efforts to reduce crime. A fellow West Virginia National Guard member, Sarah Beckstrom, was also shot in the attack. The 20-year-old died Thursday from her injuries.
    


            Morrisey remembered Beckstrom as “an amazing woman who lifted up people.”
    


            “She is someone who is going to be remembered for a very, very long time, and she had her life tragically cut short,” the governor added.
    


            The suspect in the shooting has been identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who worked with the CIA for over a decade in Afghanistan before the US military withdrew from the country.
    


            Lankanwal came to the United States in 2021 as part of Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden administration-era program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of vulnerable Afghans — many of whom worked alongside US troops and diplomats — after the American withdrawal. He applied for asylum in 2024, and it was granted earlier this year under the Trump administration.
    


            The suspect faces at least one first-degree murder charge, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro, told Fox News on Friday, adding, “There are certainly many more charges to come.”
    


            Lakanwal was wounded during the shooting and taken to the hospital, authorities said. His condition is unknown, but he has not had his first court appearance.
    


            At Monday's news conference, Morrisey emphasized that guard members volunteered to be deployed to the nation's capital and said 170 members of the state's National Guard remain in Washington, DC, to support local law enforcement.
    


            He said his office does “not have a specific date in mind” for when those troops will return to West Virginia.
    


            Morrisey declined to directly address the source of conflicting statements his office released shortly after the shooting about the condition of the two injured guard members. Initially, a statement from Morrisey's office indicated that both guard members had been killed, but it was later corrected.
    


            “I could tell you that the process is that we try to get as much information as we can, accurate information, from the most credible sources,” Morrisey said. “In this case, that information was incorrect and then within 20 minutes we changed it.”
    


            Shortly after the shooting, the Trump administration filed an emergency motion to keep the National Guard in Washington, DC, after a judge ruled that President Donald Trump's deployment of the guard was unlawful.
    


            City officials had argued in a lawsuit against the troops' deployment, saying it undermined the city's autonomy and was unnecessary.
    


            Trump also asked for 500 more National Guard troops to be deployed to the nation's capital.

            Tuesday's special election in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, normally a conservative stronghold, is giving Democrats hope that their recently successful message of affordability can help them spring a major upset.
    


            The contest pits Trump-backed Republican Matt Van Epps against Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn. The winner will replace former Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July.
    


            A month after Democrats running on cost-of-living issues won in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia, both Van Epps and Behn have campaigned on affordability. Reflecting the Republican concerns about a district Green won last year by nearly 22 points, President Donald Trump called into events for Van Epps on Monday and House Speaker Mike Johnson visited Tennessee to campaign with him.
    


            “The problem is, when you have a deep-red district, a lot of the people take for granted that the Republican or the conservative is going to win,” Johnson said in a joint interview with Van Epps on Fox News Monday afternoon.
    


            Democrats have beaten their 2024 margins in US House special elections this year by an average of 16 points. A Democratic victory on Tuesday or even outperforming last year's results would further embolden Trump's opponents heading into the midterms.
    


            “Having had the privilege of representing Tennessee in years past, I want to tell you that I have never seen the political tides shift as far and as fast as we're seeing them move in this election,” said Al Gore, who represented the state in the US Senate before becoming vice president, at a virtual rally Monday night for Behn.
    


            At a campaign event earlier Monday, Johnson held a mic to his phone so the president could be heard exhorting the crowd to vote on Tuesday.
    


            “The whole world is watching Tennessee right now, and they're watching your district,” Trump said.
    


            Trump added: “It's a big vote, and it's gonna show something. It's got to show that the Republican Party is stronger than it's ever been.”
    


            Johnson's control of the House is already fragile. Democrats are poised to fill two vacancies in the new year, one created by the death of Texas Rep. Sylvester Turner, the other by New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill's resignation. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene also plans to resign in January.
    


            “Right now, every single seat matters, and this special election will fill an important one for us,” Johnson told reporters Monday night after an event in Clarksville.
    


            Behn has focused on lowering costs since the start of her campaign, saying in a recent ad featuring a mechanical bull that “hardworking Tennesseans are getting a rough ride” from rising healthcare and grocery costs and tariffs.
    


            Van Epps, a former Army helicopter pilot and state Department of General Services commissioner, isn't conceding the issue to Behn, arguing in ads that Democrats will raise costs and taxes.
    


            “Affordability is top of our list, and I'm excited to fight alongside the president and the speaker to drive down cost of living,” Van Epps told reporters Monday night.
    


            Van Epps and his allies have also attacked Behn as out of step with the conservative-leaning district. In ads and social media posts, Republicans have highlighted past comments from Behn where she called herself a “very radical person,” expressed support for defunding the police and said she hates Nashville, parts of which she now represents in the state legislature and are in the 7th District.
    


            A recent Van Epps TV ad brands Behn a “radical disaster” and says that “Tennessee can't afford (Democrats') radical agenda” of “new taxes that would crush working families.”
    


            Behn rejected that characterization in an interview with CNN.
    


            “I don't think it's radical to have spent my entire career organizing to make healthcare more affordable or groceries cheaper,” she said.
    

In an interview with CNN's Manu Raju, Aftyn Behn, the Democratic nominee for next week's special election in a heavily Republican Tennessee congressional district, responds to comments she made on a 2020 podcast episode about Nashville.


            Behn also noted that her 2020 calls to defund the police were from before she was a lawmaker and said she'd “matured” since then. She said decisions about law enforcement funding should be made locally.
    


            Van Epps said her calls to defund the police were “unacceptable and disqualifying” in a Fox News interview last week, adding that she stands for “things that are not right for Tennessee and not right for America.”
    


            Behn said her past comments about disliking country music and Nashville came from frustration with the city's tourism industry, notably the bachelorette parties that are ubiquitous in downtown.
    


            “(Republicans) must've loved Nashville so much they cut our congressional district (into) the three Republican districts,” Behn quipped, referencing the state's previous congressional map, which included a single district covering Nashville before it was redrawn after the 2020 Census.
    


            The 7th District now runs top-to-bottom through middle Tennessee and includes corners of Nashville.
    


            Between Democratic over-performance in special elections this year and the historically narrow Republican House majority, Tuesday's race has become a magnet for outside spending from both parties.
    


            Since the primary last month, more than $5 million has been spent on advertising in the race, according to data from AdImpact. Republican-aligned groups accounted for more than $3 million and Democratic allies spending at least $2 million.
    


            Former Vice President Kamala Harris, progressive Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas and Democratic Party Chair Ken Martin have made appearances supporting Behn.
    


            New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined the virtual rally for Behn Monday night along with Gore. Ocasio-Cortez described talking to Behn about a week ago and credited her courage for running in what was once seen as a safe Republican seat.
    


            “That kind of guts is what we need more of in this country,” she said. “And again, it's not just about an ideology, but it is about a character, a kind of person that says we're not going to do something because it's easy, we're going to do it because it's the right thing to do.”

            Jersey City voters will head to the polls Tuesday for a runoff to decide whether Jim McGreevey, who resigned from the New Jersey governorship in scandal more than 20 years ago, will complete a political comeback and become their next mayor.
    


            McGreevey stepped down less than halfway into his first term, admitting to an extramarital affair and disclosing that he was gay, amid accusations that he abused his official power to pursue a romantic relationship with an aide.
    


Former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey seeks mayoral run nearly 20 years after leaving office



            McGreevey will face city councilman James Solomon. The pair were the top vote-getters in a wide field in November's general election, but neither candidate garnered the required majority to avoid a runoff: Solomon received around 29% of the vote to McGreevey's 25%.
    


            The race is non-partisan, but both McGreevey and Solomon are Democrats. Solomon, the progressive candidate to the more moderate McGreevey, has collected endorsements from most of his primary opponents and Sen. Andy Kim. McGreevey has the endorsement of outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy.
    


            In a recent debate on WPIX-TV, both candidates focused on reducing rents in Jersey City and trying to build more affordable housing, echoing the national Democratic focus on affordability, along with concerns about immigration enforcement and education.
    


            “Every family deserves a shot to stay in this special city, and that's what I'm going to be focused on,” Solomon said.
    


            But McGreevey noted in an October interview with The Associated Press, prior to making the runoff, that becoming mayor would be “a great closing act.”
    


            “My opponents may care about what happened 20 years ago,” McGreevey told the AP. “Folks in Jersey City are worried about their rent today, worried about the children's individual education plan today. They're concerned about the fact that the street is dirty or that there's a sewer break on Montgomery (Street).”
    


            Jersey City has had the same mayor, Steve Fulop, since 2013. Fulop declined to run for another term in Jersey City to run for governor, losing in the Democratic primary to now Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner announced his bid for reelection on Tuesday, launching what will be a key campaign in a narrowly divided Senate. 

In a campaign announcement, the Virginia senator said he was running for reelection to rein in America's economic crisis, particularly regarding the impact of artificial intelligence on job displacement.

“We need a vision to chart a new path and effective leadership to get it done,” Warner said. “That's why I am running for reelection to the United States Senate.”

Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate. According to the Cook Political Report, Warner represents a solidly Democratic seat.

Warner, a businessman who co-founded the company that became Nextel, served as governor of Virginia from 2002 to 2006. He was first elected in 2008 to the Senate, where he now serves as vice chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence.

Warner nodded to his business success while pitching himself as the candidate best suited to tackle AI.

“This moment calls for big ideas,” Warner said. “The tech companies that displace jobs for AI should actually help pay for the solutions. We need universal healthcare coverage and a complete overhaul of affordable housing and childcare.”

On the Republican side, state Sen. Bryce Reeves had already announced a campaign for the seat. Reeves, an Army veteran and former law enforcement officer, has served in the Virginia Senate for over a decade. 

Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, Virginia's other senator, was reelected in 2024 and will not be on the ballot in 2026.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses the D.C. National Guard ambush, broader concerns over Biden-era Afghan vetting and migration pauses from high-risk countries.

After an Afghan asylee allegedly shot two West Virginia National Guardsmen on Wednesday, President Donald Trump ordered U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow to commence a ""full-scale, rigorous reexamination"" of green-card holders from ""countries of concern.""

The directive highlights the legal avenues through which a green card — lawful permanent residence granted through an Adjustment of Status application — can be withdrawn, and those through which it cannot.

There are several major ways lawful permanent residency can be revoked.

Several immigration law firms — including Sedki and Rebecca Black — cite similar orders and descriptions on their sites, and related details appear across various federal webpages, but Fox News Digital did not find any single official source that consolidates them.

First, green-card holders can be placed in removal proceedings if they are convicted of certain crimes – including ""aggravated felonies"" such as murder, some serious sex and drug-trafficking offenses, as well as crimes involving moral turpitude like certain theft, fraud or violent-offense convictions, depending on the sentence and timing.

They can also lose their green cards over convictions connected to terrorism or espionage for foreign governments. Green-card holders also cannot vote in federal elections, and convictions connected to attempts to do so can also result in revocation of their residency status.

A second basis for withdrawal is evidence that the noncitizen obtained the green card through fraud or misrepresentation.

HOMELAND SECURITY TO SCAN MIGRANTS' SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS FOR ANTISEMITISM: 'NO ROOM FOR TERRORIST SYMPATHIZERS'

Examples include foreign nationals who used identity theft, lied on their applications, or omitted parts of their criminal history or prior contact with U.S. immigration authorities.

USCIS may also revisit Adjustment of Status applications for lawful permanent residents who became such through a marriage that ends in divorce within two years. The agency can revoke a green card if it is found the foreign national married a U.S. citizen strictly in order to achieve residency.

VETERANS GROUPS URGE TRUMP ADMIN TO CONTINUE AFGHAN ALLY SUPPORT PROGRAM AMID BUDGET CUT CONCERNS

Home address issues and questions arising out of where – including in which country – a green-card holder truly resides can also be grounds for revocation.

Lawful permanent residents must be just that: people residing permanently in the U.S. with a primary residence stateside.

Leaving the country for more than a year without obtaining a reentry permit can lead the feds to consider a green card abandoned. Changes of address within the U.S. must also be reported to USCIS.

While most people who would fall under the subsection have since died or would be in their 90s at the least, a Cold War provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) bars any noncitizen who, between March 1933 and May 1945, participated in or ordered persecutions under Germany's Nazi regime or in German-occupied territories.

Relatedly, any immigrant who has been affiliated with communism or any ""totalitarian party"" in another country, is also banned from holding a green card.

One avenue the Trump administration, however, may pursue as it commences a full-scale review of green-card holders from Afghanistan and other ""countries of concern"" is the final major way residency status may be questioned or revoked: what some firms describe as the public charge rule.

FEDERAL JUDGE IN MAJOR BLUE CITY BLOCKS KEY TRUMP MOVE ON REFUGEES: ‘NOT LIMITLESS'

According to various immigration law firms' websites, such residents relying too heavily on public assistance and government programs may find themselves in removal proceedings if they are ""deemed a public charge"" under the law – but with a key caveat.

Under the INA, simply receiving public benefits does not make a noncitizen deportable. They must have become a public charge within five years of admission ""from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen since entry."" This standard is rarely invoked.

Additionally, relevant to Trump's Afghan example, any noncitizen previously arrested or deported from the U.S., or removed as an ""enemy"" or at government expense in lieu of deportation, may not hold a green card.

'HE IS DELIVERING': TRUMP'S FIRST MONTH FLIPS SCRIPT ON RADICAL BIDEN-HARRIS BORDER POLICIES

Sections of the INA finalized in 1995 and 2025 also list other grounds of inadmissibility or deportability.

A noncitizen with a communicable disease of ""public health significance"" can be denied status, as can those with a ""mental disorder"" posing a threat, or individuals deemed ""drug addicts."" Polygamy is also a disqualifying factor.

TRUMP'S BORDER GROUND GAME IS OFF TO A FAST START. TO GUARANTEE CHANGE CONGRESS MUST DO 3 THINGS

While many of the Afghan refugees reportedly came with little to no documentation at the time of the mass withdrawal from Kabul, the INA also prescribes that foreign nationals who were never qualified to obtain full citizenship for various reasons are also ineligible for lawful permanent residence.

The administration could, potentially, investigate whether any of the largely unvetted noncitizens have disqualifying history and enforce that subsection of the INA against them.

While former President Joe Biden's Operation Welcoming Heroes was an official mission, 8 USC Sec 1182(a) 5(d) also lays out how ""any alien who is a stowaway is excludable."" That definition would likely be up to legal interpretation, as the current administration signals a no-holds barred audit of current green-card holders.

UP TO 1M MIGRANTS WHO USED BIDEN'S CBP ONE APP ORDERED TO DEPORT BY TRUMP ADMIN

Federal law states that immigration officers must state the negative determination to the green-card holder, and list the specific provision under the law that their disqualification or rescission falls under.

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House, DOJ, DHS and officials at USCIS for comment and clarification on any of the major grounds collected for a green card's withdrawal.

In comments to CBS News, Edlow said his agency has followed the president's order and ""halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible. The safety of the American people always comes first."" 

Trump quoted the INA inasmuch as: ""Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.""

Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports from Paris, France on new details in the daring daylight Louvre jewel heist and Interpol's role in tracking the suspects.

Following the recent devastating heist at the Louvre in Paris, officials are doubling down on security precautions by implementing new policies and technology that don't come cheap.

In an effort to leverage the costs, the Louvre is raising prices by targeting a specific group of visitors.

Beginning on Jan. 14, foreigners from outside the European Union will have to pay $12 more than a typical ticket, The Associated Press reported.

Tickets will rise from $25 to $37 for non-EU citizens.

Nearly 9 million people visited the Louvre in 2024, with 77% of the 8.7 million tourists being of foreign nationality. About 13% of the visitors were American, according to AP.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and GOP candidate Matt Van Epps discuss Trump's decision to halt Afghan immigration applications following the D.C. National Guardsmen attack and the upcoming Tennessee special election on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., accused House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., of siding with Democrats over Republicans in a heated public statement on Tuesday.

Stefanik, whom Johnson appointed as chairwoman of House GOP leadership earlier this year, claimed Johnson was blocking a provision in the annual defense policy bill that would allow Republicans to get revenge for being targeted in alleged instances of government weaponization.

Johnson called Stefanik's accusations ""false"" in comments to reporters on Tuesday morning and said he would support such a measure.

It's an explosive rift within the highest ranks of the House Republican Conference while the GOP wrestles with a razor-thin majority in the lower chamber.

MIKE JOHNSON, MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE CLASH IN HEATED PRIVATE GOP CALL OVER SHUTDOWN STRATEGY

The confrontation first began on Monday evening, when Stefanik posted on X, ""Republicans have the House, Senate, and the White House, yet the deep state is alive and well with the Speaker getting rolled by House Dems attempting to block my provision to require Congressional disclosure when the FBI opens counterintelligence investigations into presidential and federal candidates seeking office.""

She pointed to ex-FBI Director James Comey's 2017 testimony when Stefanik said he ""admitted to not following proper notification procedures"" when opening the investigation into whether the 2016 Trump campaign colluded with Russia.

The legislation is all the more important now, Stefanik added, with revelations that ex-Special Counsel Jack Smith seized phone records of some Republican lawmakers without their knowledge during his own probe of President Donald Trump.

Stefanik said she would vote against the annual defense bill, called the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), if the provision was not included.

The NDAA is responsible for setting national security and defense policies for the federal government every year. A concurring defense spending bill funds those policies.

Stefanik's threat is particularly notable coming from a member of the House Armed Services Committee, where the NDAA originates.

JOHNSON SAYS HE'S 'OPEN' TO CHANGING HOUSE CENSURE RULES AFTER WEEK OF POLITICAL DRAMA

She followed her post with a similar accusation on Tuesday morning, ""I just walked out of a briefing on this issue this morning CONFIRMING everything I posted yesterday.""

""That yes, in fact, the Speaker is blocking my provision to root out the illegal weaponization that led to Crossfire Hurricane, Arctic Frost, and more. He is siding with [Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.] against Trump Republicans to block this provision to protect the deep state,"" Stefanik continued.

""This is an easy one. This bill is [dead on arrival] unless this provision gets added in as it was passed out of committee,"" she said.

Johnson suggested he was blindsided by the attacks when asked during his weekly press conference on Tuesday.

""Well, all of that is false. I don't exactly know why Elise won't just call me. I texted her yesterday. She's upset. One of her provisions is not being made, I think, into the NDAA. I explained to her on a text message — as soon as I heard this yesterday, I was campaigning in Tennessee — and I wrote her, and I said, what are you talking about? This hasn't even made it to my level,"" Johnson said.

""The way regular order works is – and I think she should know this, we'll be talking about it, I'm sure today — the way this works is that, it has to go through committees of jurisdiction if it will be attached to the NDAA. And this provision that she's working on, I think is under the jurisdiction of judiciary.""

Johnson said there had to be an agreement between the top Republican and Democrat on the committees of jurisdiction in both the House and Senate for a specific provision to make it into the NDAA.

""Well, in this case — I found out last night, this wasn't even on my radar — that apparently didn't happen,"" he said.

""It doesn't mean it can't become law or even that that is a final decision. But I sent my friend Elise a text last night and I said, 'Can you find out what the issue was, and I'll help you resolve it?' I support her provision. I mean, I would vote for it. I think it's smart, and I'm not sure exactly why it wasn't included. So I don't know why she's frustrated with me. I literally had nothing to do with it. But I'm happy to roll up my sleeves and help her.""

Fox News senior correspondent Claudia Cowan reports from California as four people, including three children, are killed and 11 others wounded in a mass shooting at a Stockton birthday party.

A manhunt is still underway for a suspect in a Stockton, California, mass shooting that left four people dead this weekend, including three children, with police saying there likely were multiple shooters.

The FBI has offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of a suspect. The victims in Saturday's shooting were 8, 9, 14 and 21 years old. They were attending a birthday party for a 2-year-old, and attendees said the group was gathering around the cake when the gunshots began.

""As we got ready to start cutting her cake, everyone started gathering around and cutting the cake and all we heard were gunshots. Everybody just dove to the ground. It was just unexpected. I don't know what happened. I'm just so shocked and lost and speechless,"" said Patrice Williams, who organized the party for her daughter.

""I just want to say I'm sorry to all the mothers out there that lost their kids at my birthday party,"" she added.

Eleven people were injured in the attack, in addition to the four fatalities. Williams said that among those injured were her sister, a cousin and three of her friends.

Sheriff Patrick Withrow of the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office confirmed to the press on Monday that there ""appears to be multiple shooters,"" but authorities have not publicly identified any suspects.

""They deserve to be in jail. They deserve to go to hell,"" Williams said. ""I'm sorry, but I just ... it's not respectable. It's a kids' party.""

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amina Green, a 29-year-old data scientist based in San Francisco. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. A Waymo spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

I remember being excited for my first Waymo ride earlier last year.

When I was a child, I got into a really bad car accident, so I've always been afraid to drive myself around. It's a personal choice for me not to get my driver's license, so I walk most places in San Francisco or use ride-hailing.

I've known about autonomous-driving technology for a while. I've been living in SF for about five years. So it was exciting just to even step inside a Waymo for the first time.

The robotaxi felt safe. I appreciate the ease of use, the convenience, and the privacy.

Sometimes, after coming back from therapy, I call a Waymo because I can be in a sensitive state of mind, so I'd prefer to be alone.

It's also just fun. It feels so sci-fi. I even made a video of myself doing my makeup inside the robotaxi, and it got a lot of views on social media. There's the novelty of it to some extent. But it's also like having my own energy or vibe in the car; I can set the music to what I like, I can control the temperature — those sorts of things.

Then, in September 2024, I was involved in an incident inside a Waymo that left me a little scared and frustrated.

I was heading to an appointment to get my hair braided. I remember sitting in the front seat of the Waymo, filming randomly as I've gotten into the habit of recording myself inside the car.

Then, near the South of Market-Tenderloin area, these two guys stepped right in front of my ride after the Waymo stopped for a red light.

I don't know why they did that. They seemed like they were trying to be silly, but they kept badgering me for my number. I repeatedly told them to get out of the way, to stop, and that they were holding up traffic.

🚨Warning to women in SF 🚨I love Waymo but this was scary 😣2 men stopped in front of my car and demanded that I give my number.It left me stuck as the car was stalled in the street.Thankfully, it only lasted a few minutes...Ladies please be aware of this pic.twitter.com/6VEqb1WoJb

I was annoyed because I was already running late for my hair appointment. But I was also a bit afraid. I used to work for a nonprofit in this neighborhood, so I knew that if something happened, there wouldn't be police nearby or anyone to really help.

The most frustrating part was that after the guys left, my Waymo just sat there. It was a little scary, but also kind of annoying. Other drivers on the road were getting upset, and I felt like a sitting duck. If it had happened at night, it would've been a lot scarier.

I don't remember if I called Waymo's remote assistance or if they contacted me, but the support team determined that something had happened during my ride. They asked if I was OK; I said yes and talked a bit. Throughout the day, they called me two more times to make sure I was OK.

I ended up getting $100 in credit and participated in a user research experience with the Waymo team. It was interesting to see the features they're working on.

After the incident, I stopped taking Waymo for maybe about two or three months.

After a while, I started taking Waymo again because I still feel safer riding in a Waymo than in a human-driven vehicle.

I've been using ride-hailing services for nearly 10 years. I've had mostly positive experiences using them, but I've also had a few weird incidents.

There are situations where I wouldn't have wanted to be alone in a car with a stranger at night.

Sometimes, the ride is just straight-up dangerous. I recall a driver who was distracted by his phone, watching YouTube videos while driving.

I usually report these incidents, but I'm not sure how the companies handled the situation.

I feel safer knowing that Waymo has personnel on standby in case something happens to its cars.

That's not to say Waymo is perfect.

Beyond getting the engineering right, I think there are social and cultural factors the company should consider if it wants the technology to be widely adopted.

For example, people interact with the streets differently in different neighborhoods. I think about the Tenderloin, where it's common for people to run into the middle of the street. Is Waymo thinking about the kinds of environments its cars go through?

Maybe Waymo could give users different route options that could avoid certain neighborhoods. It may not be politically correct to say, but I think this is just the basic reality of the world we live in: There are certain neighborhoods where women, or any person, might be more likely targeted if you're by yourself.

It would also be nice if there were an extra security feature, such as automatically locking the door once the rider steps into the car.

Then, there are a lot of people in the city who aren't in tech. To them, Waymo is a symbol of this larger cultural change in the region that they feel like they're being left out of.

So, while I don't agree with it, I almost understand why some people would vandalize the cars.

I'm also just a practical rider. I still use human ride-hailing services — I'd say it's about 50-50 — because Waymo's wait time can be a bit long. Or sometimes Waymo's just way more expensive.

Ultimately, I'm positive about the technology. I hope this will be widely available, but there are some considerations and edge cases that may need to be addressed before mass adoption.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Tuesday threatened to cut off federal funding to Democratic-leaning states over their alleged refusal to share SNAP program data with the Trump administration.

The administration ""will begin to stop moving federal funds into those states"" starting next week ""until they comply,"" Rollins told President Donald Trump during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.

Rollins said her department needs the state-by-state data on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as food stamps, ""to root out this fraud and to protect the American taxpayer.""

The secretary said the U.S. Department of Agriculture in February had asked all 50 states ""for the first time to turn over their data to the federal government.""

She said 29 ""red states"" complied, but 21 ""blue states continue to say no.""

The noncompliant states include California, New York and Minnesota, Rollins said. The governors' offices for each state did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

A USDA spokesperson later specified in a statement to CNBC, ""28 States and Guam joined us in this fight; but states like California, New York, and Minnesota, among 19 other blue States, keep fighting us.""

The department had ""established a SNAP integrity team"" to analyze state data and ""end indiscriminate welfare fraud,"" the spokesperson said.

""We have sent Democrat States yet another request for data, and if they fail to comply, they will be provided with formal warning that USDA will pull their administrative funds.""

In this article

Michael Burry questioned Tesla's valuation as the investor of ""The Big Short"" fame took aim at the practice of technology companies issuing tons of stock-based compensation and excluding it from earnings results.

The investor argues that when accounting for the true profits that include the cost of this compensation and its negative dilution of the company's value over time, companies like Tesla should have lower valuations.

""Tesla's market capitalization is ridiculously overvalued today and has been for a good long time,"" Burry, who rose to fame for his call on a housing market bubble in the 2000s, wrote to subscribers of his new paid Substack.

Burry pointed out that Tesla dilutes shareholders at a rate of 3.6% each year and doesn't offer buybacks. He posted a chart with subscribers that he said ""shows the kind of present value destruction that this level of dilution can impart.""

He said the vote to accept CEO Elon Musk's $1 trillion compensation plan means investors should expect to get diluted further — meaning that that these additional shares water down their ownership of the company. The package had 75% approval among voting shares, despite proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS coming out against it.

""With recent news of Elon Musk's $1 trillion dollar pay package, dilution is certain to continue,"" Burry wrote.

Tesla's market cap is currently $1.43 trillion. The electric vehicle maker's shares have added more than 6% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 has surged more than 15% in the same period.

Burry noted that moving past dilution ""is not easy"" for businesses. He also pointed to Palantir and Amazon as other well-known technology companies that dilute their shares through employee-based compensation, a practice that Burry said ""penalizes shareholders.""

The newsletter post goes into an in-depth explanation of how stock-based compensation is not accurately reflected under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and how companies used ""adjusted"" earnings to present a bottom line that wrongly ignores the practice as a real expense.

Burry quotes Warren Buffett's view of stock-based compensation being treated as something other than a tangible expense: ""What else could it be — a gift from shareholders?"" wrote Buffett in his Berkshire Hathaway 2018 annual letter.

Burry launched his Substack called ""Cassandra Unchained"" late last month after deregistering hedge fund Scion Asset Management. The blog, which has a $379 annual subscription fee, has so far focused on why he believes artificial intelligence is a bubble.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Best Altcoins To Buy Now: DeepSnitch AI Leads With 70% Rally As ETP Inflows Hit $1B","https://blockchainreporter.net/best-altcoins-to-buy-etp-resurgence-ends-four-week-outflow-streak-deepsnitch-ai-dubbed-the-next-big-ai-coin-after-raising-650k/","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:56:39 GMT","

Crypto ETPs ended a four-week streak of losses, attracting over $1B in the last week of November, marking the first week in the green since October.

Although BTC products saw $464M in inflows, combined altcoin flows amounted to over $600M. 

In general, the market is moving further toward altcoins as Bitcoin struggles to maintain a solid price. In addition to tried-and-true coins, DeepSnitch AI, an early-stage presale, saw increased levels of activity as traders sought out high-upside opportunities. 

Raising $650K in record timing, combined with the strength of the underlying AI prediction and analytics suite, got many anticipating 100x gains and aping into DeepSnitch AI as one of the best altcoins to buy in Q4. 

According to a December 1 report by CoinShares, cryptocurrency ETPs logged $1.07B total inflows in a week, ending a four-week red streak that amounted to $5.5B. 

Bitcoin ETPs led the charge with $464M in gains, followed by Ethereum with $309M and XRP with $289M. Although generally bullish, BTC and Ethereum products are still in the red on a monthly basis, which is a stark contrast to XRP with $790M. 

The likely reason for the resurgence was restored market sentiment following Bitcoin's push above $90K and optimism over potential Fed interest cuts later in December. 

Unfortunately for traders, the trend didn't stick, and Bitcoin dropped below $86K on December 1. 

As predicting Bitcoin's short-term trajectory gets more challenging, many retail traders are looking for the best altcoins to buy in Q4 in anticipation of a Santa rally and a more confident rally in December. 

Although altcoins still haven't had their opportunity to shine, new presales, including DeepSnitch AI, have proved their resilience against wider market currents. Case in point: DeepSnitch AI raised nearly $650K while the market was going through a downturn. 

As a presale that prioritizes efficiency in development, DeepSnitch AI's prediction and analytics suite, running on five AI agents, is nearly complete. The two core agents are already running in an analytics layer, allowing them to track whale wallets, predict FUD storms, anticipate sentiment shifts, and scan tokens for rug pull risks.

While these functions will be available to early investors shortly, many traders are also aping the project for its upside potential. 

With a price of  $0.02577, DSNT is not only one of the most undervalued altcoins at the moment, but it is also the most affordable entry into the expanding AI market. Since DeepSnitch AI has mass appeal, traders expect widespread adoption, which could help the project reach a similar level of success as FET or RENDER. 

If the 100x projection comes true, DeepSnitch AI could yield $50K gains on a small investment of $500. 

DeepSnitch AI is expected to launch in January, and while no official confirmation has been made, the community anticipates a MEXC or a Bybit listing. 

According to CoinMarketCap, PI traded in the $0.2200 area on December 1, showing a noticeable downturn. 

If the December 1 performance continues, PI could drop to $0.18 before making a slow recovery back to $0.2200. 

However, a bullish scenario is also possible, especially if the project achieves new milestones or announces a major exchange listing. In this case, PI could push past $0.2600, followed by a massive surge toward $0.4800.

DOGE traded in the $0.13 area on December 1, according to CoinMarketCap. 

Even though the situation at the beginning of the month looked grim, DOGE could realistically regain its status as one of the most affordable altcoins set for growth. 

To restore DOGE's prospects, the coin must regain its 20-day EMA of $0.15, which will signal a comeback and allow the close above $0.17. If this move goes by smoothly, DOGE could eventually surge toward $0.29.

Alternatively, if sales continue, DOGE will lose the $0.13, which could lead to a massive crash to $0.10. 

With altcoins extending their weekly wins on the institutional investment scene, the time is nigh to find the best altcoins to buy to capitalize on a slight alt shift in Q4. 

Because it raised $650K and many traders are betting on its 100x narrative, the underlying prediction and analytics solution only serves to strengthen DeepSnitch AI's long-term prospects – after all, can so many traders be wrong? 

Jump in the DeepSnitch AI presale, and catch up with the latest community updates on X and Telegram. 

DeepSnitch AI, XRP, Ethereum, and Dogecoin stand out due to recent ETP inflows, strong fundamentals, and renewed market interest.

Bitcoin's unstable short-term trend and renewed ETP inflows push traders toward altcoins with stronger momentum and better short-term upside.

DeepSnitch AI raised $650K during a downturn, offers a nearly complete AI analytics suite, and carries a widely discussed 100x upside potential. Most importantly, the solution is already operational and will be made available to investors soon.

 Stocks advanced Tuesday, a day after the three major equities indexes ended their runs of five consecutive winning sessions.


 The tech-heavy Nasdaq, blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, and benchmark S&P 500 were up a respective 0.7%, 0.4%, and 0.3% in recent trading. Yesterday, the indexes closed lower as the final trading month of the year began, with shares of big tech and cryptocurrency-tied firms falling amid risk-off sentiment. 


 Bitcoin was trading around $92,000, up sharply from its overnight low of below $85,500. Yesterday, the largest cryptocurrency suffered its worst day since March, tumbling from around $91,000 and weighing on crypto-tied stocks Strategy (MSTR), MARA Holdings (MARA), Coinbase Global (COIN), and Robinhood Markets (HOOD). They all rose between roughly 4% and 8% Tuesday.


 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed around 4.09% after surging yesterday from Friday's close of 4.01%. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the performance of the dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, ticked higher to 99.45.


 WTI crude futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, slipped 0.6% to around $59 per barrel, and gold futures fell more than 1% to $4,225 per ounce.


 Nvidia (NVDA) shares, which advanced 1.7% Monday after it announced an expanded partnership with and $2 billion investment in Synopsys (SNPS), rose 1% further Tuesday. Most of the other Magnificent Seven large-cap technology firms also were slightly higher.


 Boeing (BA) shares soared 9% to lead the S&P 500 and Dow after CFO Jay Malave said at a conference that the plane maker expects 737 and 787 deliveries will increase in 2026.


 Shares of MongoDB (MDB) and Credo Technology Group Holding (CRDO) surged 23% and 16%, respectively, after each posted quarterly results that easily topped analysts' estimates. CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) were up about 2% ahead of their respective quarterly results after the closing bell.


 Elsewhere, Costco Wholesale (COST) stock little changed after the retailer sued the Trump administration over its tariffs; shares of Moderna (MRNA) and Shopify (SHOP) were down less than 1% and up roughly 6% after they led S&P 500 and Nasdaq decliners, respectively, on Monday; and Bayer closed up nearly 12% in Frankfurt trading after U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer supported the German agricultural company's push for the Supreme Court to review its Roundup weedkiller case.


Instacart Parent's Stock Falls as Amazon Tests 30-Minute Deliveries

 Amazon (AMZN) is rolling out ""ultra-fast"" deliveries in Seattle and Philadelphia. The news is affecting shares of Instacart parent Maplebear (CART).


 Shares of Maplebear were down 4% in recent trading after Amazon announced in a blog post that it's ""now testing an ultra-fast delivery offering of the items customers want and need most urgently in parts of Seattle and Philadelphia. Amazon Now brings thousands of household essential items and groceries to customers' doorsteps in about 30 minutes or less.""


Yuki Iwamura / Bloomberg via Getty Images

 The e-commerce giant added that Amazon Prime members will receive ""discounted delivery fees starting at just $3.99 per order (vs. $13.99 for non-Prime customers),"" and that a ""small basket fee of $1.99 will apply to orders below $15.""


 Amazon shares, which ticked 0.5% higher, are up 7% this year. Maplebear shares are fractionally lower in 2025.


Mark Your Calendar: Some People Will Receive Two Social Security Payments in December

 The Social Security Administration distributes benefits to almost 74 million people each month. Here is when to expect yours in December.


 Payments are primarily distributed according to beneficiaries' birth dates. However, for those who began receiving retirement, spousal, or survivor benefits before May 1997, they typically receive their payments on the 3rd of every month.


 Supplemental Security Income, a program that provides additional income for people with disabilities and adults aged 65 and older with limited or no income, is distributed separately from Social Security benefits at the beginning of every month.


 In some cases, when the beginning of the month coincides with a weekend or holiday, SSI benefits will be distributed in the preceding month. Due to government holidays in December, Supplemental Security Income recipients will receive two checks before the end of the year.

Signet Jewelers Stock Falls on Soft Guidance

 Shares of Signet Jewelers (SIG) fell 4% Tuesday afternoon after the parent of Kay Jewelers, Zales, and Jared issued weaker-than-expected current-quarter projections.


 Signet expects fiscal 2026 fourth-quarter sales of $2.24 billion to $2.37 billion, while analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for $2.38 billion. The company also sees same-store sales between a 5% year-over-year decline and a gain of 0.5%, while analysts were expecting an increase of 1.15%.

 In addition, Signet's projections for adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA were weaker than consensus.


 Signet's third-quarter adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share and sales of $1.39 billion were better than analysts expected.


 Despite today's declines, shares of Signet are up about 14% this year.


Top Stock Movers Now: Boeing, Intel, Sandisk, and More

 Major U.S. equities indexes gained ground on Tuesday, with tech stocks trending higher after a day of declines on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and benchmark S&P 500 gained 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, and the tech-centric Nasdaq rose 0.4%.


 Boeing (BA) shares surged 8%, the leading gainers on the S&P 500 after the plane maker's new CFO said at a conference held by UBS that its plan to ramp up production after safety issues substantially slowed production last year are going according to schedule, and said Boeing expects to generate positive free cash flow next year after burning through billions in the last two years.


 Intel (INTC) stock rose 7% as the chipmaker announced plans to invest about $200 million to increase its manufacturing footprint in Malaysia. The stock is also extending a rally that was sparked Friday by reports that Apple (AAPL) could be the company's next big customer.

 Shares of database software maker MongoDB (MDB) popped nearly 25% a day after the company's latest quarterly results easily topped estimates as it also lifted forecasts for the full year, a month after appointing a new CEO.

Costco Is Suing the Trump Administration—Here's Why

 Warehouse retail giant Costco Wholesale (COST) has joined the list of companies looking for a refund on tariffs.


 The company filed a lawsuit against U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Trump administration on Friday. In the Court of International Trade, Costco said that it would seek a refund of the tariffs it has paid on imports in the last several months if the Supreme Court finds Trump's tariffs unconstitutional.


Kevin Carter / Getty Images

 Costco did not specify in the filing how much it has paid in tariffs, but executives have said in earnings calls that the company was working with its suppliers to minimize the impact and that it would work to keep prices as low as it could.


 In its complaint, Costco is requesting that the trade court find the tariffs are invalid, prevent CBP from collecting further tariff payments, and guarantee a refund of the tariffs the company has paid and those it may pay before the case is decided.

Boeing Stock Powers S&P 500, Dow Higher After CFO Comments on Deliveries, Cash Flow

 Comments by Boeing (BA) CFO Jay Malave at a conference Tuesday morning are lifting the company's shares and major indexes.


 Boeing stock soared 8% to lead the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average after Malave said at the UBS Global Industrials and Transportation Conference that ""we expect absolutely deliveries to be up (in 2026) in both cases, both 737 and both 787.""


 In addition, Malave said that ""we absolutely expect to grow year-over-year in cash flow,"" adding that ""what we expect anyway is in the low single digits in terms of positive free cash flow, which I think is pretty substantial growth year-over-year.""


 Including Tuesday's sharp gains, Boeing shares have risen about 14% this year, slightly better than the Dow's advance but slightly worse than the S&P 500's.

Here's Why the Maker of Roundup Weedkiller's Stock Is Surging Today

 Shares of pharmaceutical conglomerate Bayer are surging 13% on their home exchange in Germany after the U.S. Solicitor General supported its efforts to have the Supreme Court review prior rulings on whether Roundup weedkiller, produced by Bayer-owned Monsanto, needs a cancer risk warning label.


 The solicitor general said in a Monday filing that the Environmental Protection Agency has for years said that glyphosate, a chemical used in Roundup, is ""not likely to be carcinogenic in humans,"" and said the Food and Drug Administration has approved ""hundreds of labels for Roundup"" that did not include any information about cancer.

 Bayer has argued that since federal agencies have determined the chemical doesn't require a cancer warning, customers should not be able to sue for violating state laws regarding a failure to warn customers about cancer risks. Bayer said most of the tens of thousands of outstanding lawsuits are ""grounded in failure-to-warn theories,"" meaning they would be invalidated by a ruling that Bayer isn't bound by state failure-to-warn laws.


 Bayer said it welcomes the support. It said a ruling from the Supreme Court on whether companies can be sued for violating state laws when complying with a federal agency's determination of a chemical's safety would provide clarity for the company and customers. Bayer said it ""continues to advance its multi-pronged strategy designed to significantly contain the litigation by the end of 2026.""


 Monsanto was acquired by Bayer in 2018 for $63 billion, and a California jury held Monsanto liable just months after the deal was closed for failing to warn about Roundup's potential cancer risks after a groundskeeper was diagnosed with cancer.

How You Should Tackle 'Travel Tuesday': Expert Views on the Promotion

 You may still be settling in from a Thanksgiving trip, but experts say it's smart to start planning your next getaway.


 Nearly all major airlines and several hotels will offer bargain rates tomorrow in what's become known as ""Travel Tuesday"". Travel companies now extend more deals on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving than on Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined, according to Hopper, a travel booking app.


 The industrywide promotion grew out of an annual deal Hopper launched in 2017, and has become a bonafide opportunity for bargain-hunting, said Clint Henderson, managing editor of The Points Guy, a travel site.

 ""It's probably the best time of the year to book cheap flights,"" said Henderson, later explaining that he initially saw Travel Tuesday as a marketing move. “I used to tell people, ‘Don't bother,' but now I'm all in.”


 Travel Tuesday airfare deals often promote winter travel, and only apply to flights departing in January or February. Warm destinations are widely touted. For instance, Delta Air Lines (DAL) is selling roundtrip tickets from New York City to the Dominican Republic, Cayman Islands and St. Thomas for less than $300.


 But domestic airfare may be particularly inexpensive—Alaska Air Group (ALK) is promoting regional one-way tickets for as low as $29, and trips from California to Hawaii for $99, according to its website.

Pair traders hunting for an edge might want to focus on a little-known gauge tied to bitcoin BTC$92,090.61 and the S&P 500.

That gauge is the spread between Volmex's BVIV – the 30-day implied volatility index for BTC – and its S&P 500 counterpart, the VIX index. The spread has started to widen again, suggesting BTC volatility is expected to outpace equity market risk.

Implied volatility is influenced by demand for options or hedging instruments.""When the BVIV-VIX spread widens, it typically signals that markets expect higher volatility in crypto than in equities,"" Volmex's Founder Cole Kennelly told CoinDesk. ""Crypto options markets adjust more rapidly to liquidity and macro catalysts, so implied volatility often moves ahead of traditional markets.""

The spread recently broke out of a months-long range play between 20.000 and 32.000 and pierced the downtrend from March 2024's peak. These patterns suggest that BTC is likely to see more volatility than the S&P 500 in the coming days.

Prospects of BTC volatility becoming relatively richer compared to the S&P 500 may draw pair traders to consider opposing volatility bets in BTC and the S&P 500.

""When the BVIV–VIX spread widens meaningfully, some traders view it as a relative value setup: crypto implied volatility has cheapened or richened relative to equity volatility. This type of view is typically expressed through multi-legged cross-asset volatility trades rather than a simple directional position,"" Kennelly explained. 

Trading volatility, a capital-intensive strategy, involves betting on price swings rather than direction, typically through non-directional options or volatility futures. 

It goes without saying that these strategies are risky, like other plays, and require constant monitoring of positions and ample capital, which makes them suitable for institutions.

The collection of markings is now thought to have been left by a herd of ancient sea turtles that had been frightened off by a sudden earthquake.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

83 million years ago, the Cònero Riviera on the eastern shore of Italy was a submerged Cretaceous haven for marine reptiles and fish, including the ancestors of modern sea turtles. But one day, ominous rumblings from below sent them scattering en masse, and their frantic flipper marks were frozen in time.

As climbers were scaling the steep limestone slopes of Monte Cònero in the spring of 2019, they found what appeared to be a stampede of footprints embedded in the rock face. The marks appeared similar to ichnofossils—marks left behind by life-forms, but not the remains of the life forms themselves—on a nearby slab of rock discovered by paleontologist Luca Natali months before. Natali would later attribute the traces to extinct marine reptile Coneroichnus marinus, thought to be a type of pliosaur. 

When the climbers brought digital photos of their find to paleontologist Alessandro Montanari at the Geological Observatory of Coldigioco, he knew the prints were worth pursuing. The sheer cliff where the footprints lie over La Vela Beach is over 328 feet (100 meters) above sea level, but that didn't stop Montanari and his research team. They were able to gain access to Cònero Regional Park (closed to the public because of rockfalls) to survey the area on foot, and sent drones to capture more images with a panoramic view from above.

“We hypothesized that the footprints, which were probably made by a group of medium-sized marine vertebrates paddling towards southwest on a soft pelagic seafloor, were preserved on that oozy sediment because they were immediately buried and sealed under a calcilutitic turbidite,” Montanari said in a study recently published in Cretaceous Research.

What creature could have left so many of these traces as it swam away? Well, during the Late Cretaceous, the only vertebrates to live near the bottom of the ocean were fish and reptiles. While the bones of many marine species have been found preserved in limestone that was once underwater, nothing with prints of their feet, fins, or paddles has ever surfaced. Such prints would not have lasted long on a seafloor of oozing sediment—they would have easily been erased by the flow of water or washed away by deep currents.

Because fish do not paddle on the sand with their fins, Montanari and his team needed to consider the types of marine reptiles that were around during that period. They thought it was possible that the tracks came from either mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, or sea turtles from the extinct lineage Protostegidaae, even though no fossilized remains of these sea turtles or plesiosaurs had been found in the region. Despite the lack of fossil evidence, the researchers contiued to investigate every avenue, going off of previous reports of trackways left by a Triassic nothosaur and a sea turtle that lived during the Late Pleistocene.

While ancient sea turtles and plesiosaurs were both mostly solitary creatures, females of most extant sea turtle species will migrate over long distances and in herds to lay their eggs on tropical beaches. In addition, the Hawaiian green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) and Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) are both known to inhabit shallow reefs, and sometimes swim close to the seafloor and brush the sand with their fore-flippers. The environments in which these turtles live are similar to what Monte Cònero and La Vela beach are imagined to have been like tens of millions of years ago.

“The prevalence of sea turtle species in these environments leads us to hypothesize that the myriad trace fossils of the La Vela Slabs represent a mass displacement of a very large number of these animals,” said Montanari, who thinks the ancient critters were probably foraging when they were spooked. “A sudden earthquake provoked a stampede toward the open sea.”

When the already panicked sea turtles tried to escape, some were so close to the seafloor that they left flipper tracks in their wake. The earthquake released calcilutitic fluxoturbidite—coarse deposits mixed with fine-grained sediment that would turn into limestone—which buried and preserved the soft carbonate sediment and its record of a sea turtle mass exodus. Earthquake activity at this time coincides with the period of climate change known as the Early Campanian Event, which was thought to have been triggered by an asteroid impact.

For any rock climbers who might be exploring places known to be fossil beds, it might be worth keeping some form of camera on hand. It could lead to discovering something that has been waiting to be found for tens or even hundreds of millions of years.

This cell likes it hot. A tiny, single-celled amoeba that can thrive at temperatures that kill all other known complex life — organisms whose cells contain a nucleus and internal structures — has been found.

The discovery questions the notion that such ‘eukaryotic' life — which includes all animals and plants — is not suited to the kind of extreme conditions that can be tolerated by bacteria and other organisms lacking a cell nucleus.

“We need to rethink what's possible for a eukaryotic cell in a significant way,” says Angela Oliverio, a microbiologist at Syracuse University in New York. The work, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was described in a preprint1 published on 24 November.

Oliverio and fellow Syracuse microbiologist Beryl Rappaport were part of a team that discovered the organism at Lassen Volcanic National Park in northern California's Cascade mountain range. They named it Incendiamoeba cascadensis, which translates to ‘fire amoeba from the cascades'.

The park is famous for gurgling acid lakes and incandescent geothermal pools, but I. cascadensis comes from a pH-neutral ‘hot stream'. “It's the most uninteresting geothermal feature you'll find in Lassen,” says Rappaport.

Water samples from the stream looked devoid of life under a microscope, but after culturing them with nutrients, the researchers spotted the amoeba growing at 57 °C, within the stream's temperature range. The scientists slowly raised the temperature, sailing past the previous eukaryote record of 60 °C. I. cascadensis was still able to divide at 63 °C and was still moving around at 64 °C. Even at 70 °C, the cells could form dormant ‘cysts' that were capable of reactivating at cooler temperatures.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is bulking up its AI agent platform, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, to make building and monitoring AI agents easier for enterprises.

AWS announced multiple new AgentCore features on Tuesday during the company's annual AWS re:Invent conference. The company announced new tools for managing AI agent boundaries, agent memory capabilities, and agent evaluation features.

One upgrade is the introduction of Policy in AgentCore. This feature allows users to set boundaries for agent interactions using natural language. These boundaries integrate with AgentCore Gateway, which connects AI agents with outside tools, to automatically check each agent's action and stop those that violate written controls.

Policy allows developers to set access controls to certain internal data or third-party applications like Salesforce or Slack. These boundaries can also include telling an AI agent they can automatically issue refunds up to $100 but must bring a human in the loop for anything larger, David Richardson, vice president of AgentCore, told TechCrunch.

The company also announced AgentCore Evaluations, which is a suite of 13 pre-built evaluation systems for AI agents that monitor factors including correctness, safety, and tool selection accuracy, among others. This also allows developers to have a head start in building their own evaluation features as well.

“That one is really going to help address the biggest fears that people have [with] deploying agents,” Richardson said about the new evaluation capabilities. “[It's] a thing that a lot of people want to have but is tedious to build.”

AWS also announced that it's building a memory capability into the agent platform, AgentCore Memory. This feature allows agents to develop a log of information on users over time, like their flight time or hotel preferences, and use that information to inform future decisions.

“Across these three things, we are continuing to iterate at the different layers at AgentCore,” Richardson said. “Talking to existing systems with Policy, [making agents] more powerful with [AgentCore Memory], helping the development team iterate with an agent.”

While agents are the soup du jour of the AI industry right now, some people believe the technology won't last. But Richardson thinks that the tools AgentCore is developing can withstand the fast-moving market even as trends change — which he expects they will.

“Being able to take advantage of the reasoning capabilities of these models, which is coupled with being able to do real-world things through tools, feels like a sustainable pattern,” Richardson said. “The way that pattern works will definitely change. I think we feel ready for that.”

Amazon Web Services, which has been building its own AI training chips for years now, just introduced a new version known as Trainium3 that comes with some impressive specs.

The cloud provider, which made the announcement Tuesday at AWS re:Invent 2025, also teased the next product on its AI training product roadmap: Trainium4, which is already in the works and will be able to work with Nvidia's chips.

AWS used its annual tech conference to formally launch Trainium3 UltraServer, a system powered by the company's state-of-the art, 3 nanometer Trainium3 chip, as well as its homegrown networking tech. As you might expect, the third-generation chip and system offer big bumps in performance for AI training and inference over the second-generation chip, according to AWS.

AWS says the system is more than 4x faster, with 4x more memory, not just for training, but for delivering AI apps at peak demand. Additionally, thousands of UltraServers can be linked together to provide an app with up to 1 million Trainium3 chips — 10x the previous generation. Each UltraServer can host 144 chips, according to the company. 

Perhaps more importantly, AWS says the chips and systems are also 40% more energy efficient than the previous generation. While the world races to build bigger data centers powered by astronomical gigawatts of electricity, data center giant AWS is trying to make systems that drink less, not more.

It is, obviously, in AWS's direct interests to do so. But in its classic, Amazon cost-conscious way, it promises that these systems save its AI cloud customers money, too.  

AWS customers like Anthropic (of which Amazon is also an investor), Japan's LLM Karakuri, SplashMusic, and Decart have already been using the third-gen chip and system and significantly cut their inference costs, Amazon said. 

AWS also presented a bit of a roadmap for the next chip, Trainium4, which is already in development. AWS promised the chip will provide another big step up in performance and support Nvidia's NVLink Fusion high-speed chip interconnect technology.  

This means the AWS Trainium4-powered systems will be able to interoperate and extend their performance with Nvidia GPUs while still using Amazon's homegrown, lower-cost server rack technology.  

It's worth noting, too, that Nvidia's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) has become the de facto standard that all the major AI apps are built to support. The Trainium4-powered systems may make it easier to woo big AI apps built with Nvidia GPUs in mind to Amazon's cloud.

Amazon did not announce a timeline for Trainium4. If the company follows previous rollout timelines, we'll likely hear more about Trainium4 at next year's conference.

A large portion of the many tens of billions of dollars they have at their disposal (OpenAI raised 40 billion in April) is going toward this ambition.The point is that you can be right that they're not losing money serving their current userbase, but their investors might still take a bath if the very-ambitious aspect of their operations do not bear fruit.

Deno has it's use case.  Bun has it's. Deno want's to be secure and require permissions. Bun just wants to make clean, simple, projects. This fight between Rust vs The World is getting old. Rust isn't any ""safer"" when Deno can panic too.

reply

Even with a cold cache, `bun install` with a large-ish dependency graph is significantly faster than `npm install` in my experience.I don't know if Deno does that, but some googling for ""deno install performance vs npm install"" doesn't turn up much, so I suspect not?As a runtime, though, I have no opinion. I did test it against Node, but for my use case (build tooling for web projects) it didn't make a noticeable difference, so I decided to stick with Node.

Deno seems like the better replacement for Node, but it'd still be at risk of NPM supply chain attacks which seems to be the greater concern for companies these days.

Between that and the discord, I have gotten the distinct impression that deno is for ""server javascript"" first, rather than just ""javascript"" first. Which is understandable, but not very catering to me, a frontend-first dev.

This is just completely insane. We went through more than a decade of performance competition in the JS VM space, and the _only_ justification that Google had for creating V8 was performance.> The V8 engine was first introduced by Google in 2008, coinciding with the launch of the Google Chrome web browser. At the time, web applications were becoming increasingly complex, and there was a growing need for a faster, more efficient JavaScript engine. Google recognized this need and set out to create an engine that could significantly improve JavaScript performance.I guess this is the time we live in.

Programming languages all are a balance between performance/etc and making it easy for a human to interact with.

Claude will likely be bundled up nicely with Bun in the near future. I could see this being useful to let even a beginner use claude code.Edit:Lastly, what I meant originally is that most front-end work happens with tools like Node or Bun. At first I was thinking they could use it to speed up generating / pulling JS projects, but it seems more likely Claude Code and bun will have a separate project where they integrate both and make Claude Code take full advantage of Bun itself, and Bun will focus on tight coupling to ensure Claude Code is optimally running.

Frontend work by definitions n doesn't happen with either Node nor Bun. Some frontend tooling might be using a JS runtime but the value add of that is minimal and a lot of JS tooling is actually being rewritten in Rust for performance anyway.

reply

And if you're expressing hierarchical UI, the best way to do it is HTML and CSS. It has the richest ecosystem, and it is one of the most mature technologies in existence. JS / TS are the native languages for those tools. Everything is informed by this.Of course, there are other options. You could jam HTML and CSS into (as you mention) Rust, or C, or whatever. But then the ecosystem is extremely lacking, and you're reinventing the wheel. You could use something simpler, like QML or handrolled. But then you lose the aforementioned breadth of features and compatibilities with all the browser code ever written.TypeScript is genuinely, for my money, the best option. The big problem is that the terminal backends aren't mature (as you said, scrollback, etc). But, given time and money, that'll get sorted out. It's much easier to fix the terminal stuff than to rewrite all of the browser.

(1) Bun is what technical startups should be. Consistently excellent decisions, hyper focused on user experience, and a truly excellent technical product.(2) We live in a world where TUIs are causing billion dollar acquisitions. Think about that. Obviously, Bun itself is largely orthogonal to the TUIs. Just another use case. But also obviously, they wouldn't have been acquired like this without this use case.(3) There's been questions of whether startups like Bun can exist. How will they make money? When will they have to sell out one of the three principles in (1) to do so? The answer seems to be that they don't; at least, not like we expected, and in my opinion not in a sinister way.A sinister or corrupting sell out would be e.g. like Conan. What started as an excellent tool became a bloated, versioned mess as they were forced to implement features to support the corporate customers that sustained them.This feels different. Of course, there will be some selling out. But largely the interests of Anthropic seem aligned with ""build the best JS runtime"", since Anthropic themselves must be laser focused on user experience with Claude Code. And just look at Opencode [^1] if you want to see what leaning all the way into Bun gets you. Single file binary distribution, absurdly fast, gorgeous. Their backend, OpenTUI [^2], is a large part of this, and was built in close correspondence with the Bun folks. It's not something that could exist without Bun, in my opinion.(4) Anthropic could have certainly let Bun be a third party to which they contributed. They did not have to purchase them. But they did. There is a strange not-quite altruism in this; at worst, a casting off of the exploitation of open source we often see from the biggest companies. Things change; what seems almost altruistic now could be revealed to be sinister, or could morph into such. But for now, at least, it feels good and right.[^1]: https://github.com/sst/opencode

I didn't say it was definitely the end or definitely would end up worse, just that someone who's followed tech news for a while is unlikely to take this as increasing the odds Bun survives mid-term. If the company was in trouble anyway, sure, maybe, but not if they still had fourish years in the bank.“Acquired product thriving four years later” isn't unheard of, but it's not what you expect. The norm is the product's dead or stagnant and dying by then.

No, it does not. This article first says that normally you would run an application and the database on separate servers and then starts measuring the performance of a locally embedded database. If you have to keep the initial requirement for your software, then SQLite is completely out of equation. If you can change the requirement, then you can achieve similar performance by tuning the local PGSQL instance -- and then it also becomes a valuation of features and not just raw throughput. I'm not saying SQLite is not an option either, but this article seems confusing in that it compares two different problems/solutions.

reply

It'd be a very short article if so, don't you think? Full article would be something like: ""Normally you'd have a remote connection to the database, and since we're supposed to test SQLite's performance, and SQLite is embedded, it doesn't compare. Fin""

The other thing to point out is in this article is that the PG network example CANNOT scale horizontally due to the power law. You can throw a super cluster at the problem and still fundamentally do around 1000 TPS.

3x EX44 running Patroni + PostgreSQL would give you 64GB of working memory, at least 512 GB NVMe of dataset (configurable with more for a one-time fee) at HA + 1 maintenance node. Practically speaking, that would have carried the first 5 - 10 years of production at the company I work at with ease, for 120 Euros hardware cost/month + a decent sysadmin.I also know quite a few companies who toss 3-4x 20k - 30k at DELL every few years to get a database cluster on-prem so that database performance ceases to be a problem (unless the application has bad queries).

No one has solved this problem. Scale out is typically more elastic, at least for reads.

A sqlite related issue I ran into had to do with accessing the SQLite database from multiple threads. Found out a solution easily: for multi-threading use, SQLite needed to be initialized with a `SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX` flag. Since then, the website has been running seamlessly for about 3 weeks now.

1. Chrome/v8 takes TS code, compiles it down to JS internally, erases types, and then runs it like normal. This isn't going to be too hard to do, but also isn't going to be very meaningful. Compiling is a one-step process in any case, and plenty of tooling exists to make it seamless.2. Chrome/v8 actually understands TS types at runtime, and throws exceptions for mismatches. This isn't going to be possible without a major rewrite of the v8 engine and the ECMAScript spec itself.And a big challenge for both of these is that TypeScript is iterating at too fast a pace for something like Chrome to keep up. It's best to just leave versioning and compilation for the developer to manage and give end users a consistent JavaScript experience.

That's not how TypeScript works. You execute it after erasing the types.

There's effort towards ""erasable syntax"" but in practice not many really want to run anything more than basic TS in the browser, simply because you lose things like 'import _ from ""lodash"", which requires further setup (import maps) or is impractical in larger projects.The real reason however is that TS is just a language, not part of any standard, and browsers are not just going to support random languages headed by corporations (Microsoft) and that are not community projects.

Emma Hinchliffe is Fortune's Most Powerful Women editor, overseeing editorial for the longstanding franchise. As a senior writer at Fortune, Emma has covered women in business and gender-lens news across business, politics, and culture. She is the lead author of the Most Powerful Women Daily newsletter (formerly the Broadsheet), Fortune's daily missive for and about the women leading the business world.

Billionaire Michele Kang has made a splash in women's sports with her goal of professionalizing women's soccer. She owns the Washington Spirit, the London City Lionesses, OL Lyonnes, and in 2024 launched Kynisca, a women's sports organization to power it all. Now, Fortune is the first to report, she's launching the Kang Women's Institute, an organization within U.S. Soccer's Soccer Forward foundation. It promises to research the needs of female athletes, from their specific requirements for injury recovery and reentry after pregnancy to best practices for coaching girls in youth sports.

Kang started this work through her own organization; after buying three clubs, she noticed problems compared to men's sports. “Why do we have more ACL injuries? Why don't we have enough female coaches and referees?” she was asking after entering the space with the capital she earned from selling her health care IT company. Earlier this year, she merged Kynisca's innovation hub with U.S. Soccer in the hopes that the federation's brand-name convening power would get researchers and study participants on board faster. In total, she's committed $55 million to this work, $25 million for the new institute with projects already in the works with UNC and Duke and $30 million for specific programs for youth sports and coaching. Kang has previously announced her financial commitments and is announcing the launch of the new institute today.





Only 6% of global sports science research globally focuses on women. Kang says that's because of less attention paid to women both in sports and in health research more broadly. “It's an overall bias in society,” she says. In sports, women have been treated as “small men,” she says. 





Emma Hayes, coach of the U.S. Women's National Team and former manager of Chelsea Women where she won seven titles, served as a key adviser on this effort.  “The whole system is based on copy and paste from the men's game,” she says. 





Hayes realized the detrimental effects that treating women athletes the same as men could have about a decade ago, when three of her players at Chelsea had ACL injuries in one year. Physical therapists didn't understand why women weren't coming back in the same six- to seven-month window as men. They didn't factor in that “we don't have as much testosterone, so we don't build muscle in the same way,” she recalls. If their rehab could have incorporated those factors from the beginning, the players might have been better served. Then when Chelsea was in the FA Cup, several players on the team were all in the final phase of their menstrual cycle, and it affected their reaction times. She wanted to understand how to train across nutrition and performance to account for these realities.




More recently, the U.S. Women's National Team has had multiple players become pregnant and give birth. She wants to not just support players when they return to play, but help them throughout their pregnancies—like understanding when and how to train, and accounting for that player's specific experience of pregnancy. When they do come back, their return to play plan should take into account whether they had a vaginal birth or a C-section. 





The Kang Institute plans to tackle all of this. At Kang's clubs, players wear Oura rings to track their health data and train based on those insights. 





It's a radical departure from where U.S. Soccer was just a few years ago—settling a lawsuit with players over their fight for equal pay. The lawsuit was settled in 2022, and Hayes joined as coach in 2024. Kang started getting involved in women's sports almost four years ago. 





Some of the most fascinating work, however, will happen at the youth level. The pipeline into women's soccer starts young; many professional women's athletes credit Title IX with creating the opportunity for them to reach the pros. Research shows that girls often drop out of sports around age 12—just as they're entering puberty and dealing with body confidence issues. Youth sports coaches should be trained how to handle the sensitive time in girls' lives, Hayes says. “It's not as simple as just going to the field with an extra tampon and a sanitary towel, though that would be helpful,” she says. “Everything from ensuring we don't wear white shorts to what are the best ways for having challenging conversations in what is a really tricky period for young girls? How might we support when body images plays such an important part of their own self-confidence?”





The Kang Institute has officially committed to launching the first nationwide study focused on the needs of female athletes; collaborating with the NWSL and USL, the two main professional leagues, to establish research-backed standards in player health, safety protocols, and training methods; and creating tools and resources to support athlete well-being. 




For Kang, the work in youth sports achieves a social mission and future proofs her own clubs and sport for the decades ahead. Girls' soccer programs in the U.S. have less infrastructure and support compared to Europe, and American clubs are fighting to keep players like the Washington Spirit's Trinity Rodman in the U.S., where salary caps limit how much stars can earn. 





“We have to make sure that we invest in really showing the clear path,” she says, “so that young girls can aspire to be the next Alex Morgan, the next Trinity Rodman.”

The USWNT is eyeing another 2025 victory, with US Soccer announcing the finalists for the federation's end-of-year awards on Monday, including the five women nominated for US Soccer Female Player of the Year.

After stellar runs for both club and country, Arsenal defender Emily Fox, Portland Thorns midfielder Sam Coffey, Gotham FC midfielder Rose Lavelle, and Chelsea FC forwards Alyssa Thompson and Catarina Macario headline the 2025 shortlist.

A post shared by Just Women's Sports (@justwomenssports)

The youth national teams' Young Female Player of the Year award also tapped top finalists in Angel City forward Riley Tiernan, Chicago Stars forward Micayla Johnson, Seattle Reign defender Jordyn Bugg, Gotham FC defender Lilly Reale, and University of Virginia freshman defender Pearl Cecil.

The USWNT also earned a Game of the Year nomination, with US Soccer recognizing the team's dominant 3-0 victory over North American rival Canada in July.

While national team play is paramount in determining the honorees, club performances also factor into the awards, with several Player of the Year nominees significantly adding to their resumes away from the international pitch in 2025.

In May, Fox helped Arsenal to the 2024/25 UEFA Champions League title and Macario lifted the WSL trophy with Chelsea, while Gotham stars Lavelle and Reale finished their NWSL season as league champions late last month — with Reale also taking home the 2025 NWSL Rookie of the Year trophy.

Players, coaches, media, the US Soccer board, and fans will determine the ultimate winners, with fan picks making up 15% of the final tally.

Fans can submit their votes online now through Friday, December 12th, with US Soccer slated to announce the winners in January.

US runner Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone has done it again, winning the Women's World Athlete of the Year for the second time at the 2025 World Athletics Awards on Sunday.

In a pivot from her historic 400-meter hurdles dominance, McLaughlin-Levrone chose to master its flat counterpart this year, racing to an undefeated season in the 400-meter flat event in 2025.

""For me, 2025 was a year of stepping outside of the comfort zone and pushing the bounds of what was mentally and physically possible,"" the four-time US Olympic gold medalist said in a Sunday press release. ""I want to continue pushing boundaries in 2026.""

Already a winner of the 2018 World Athletics Rising Star Award, McLaughlin-Levrone snagged her first Women's World Athlete of the Year honor in 2022 following a first-ever individual world title in her signature 400-meter hurdles.

This year, the 26-year-old claimed a second individual world trophy in record-breaking fashion, winning the 400-meter with a Championships and North American record-shattering time of 47.78 seconds — the second-fastest of all time — at September's 2025 World Championships in Tokyo.

The victory cemented her as the first athlete to claim world titles in both the 400-meter hurdles and 400-meter flat, ultimately earning her Sunday's World Athlete of the Year honor.

""The culmination of the season in Tokyo was a really special moment. I'm so thankful for everyone who supported, watched, voted, and who was there throughout this whole process,"" McLaughlin-Levrone added.

The  world No. 2 USWNT ended 2025 with a bang on Monday night, shutting out No. 12 Italy yet again behind first-half goals from young stars Catarina Macario and Jaedyn Shaw.

Macario's masterful 20th-minute chip shot continued a scoring tear for the 26-year-old, marking her fifth US goal in the last three matches while bringing her 2025 tally to a team-leading eight.

""[I'm] finally finding some consistency,"" Macario said after Monday's 2-0 win, commenting on her history of lingering knee injuries. ""Considering everything that I've been through for the past three years, that is definitely the thing I'm most proud of.""

Shaw then capped the match's scoring in the 41st minute, when the 21-year-old blasted a bullet from the top of the box to double the US lead.

A post shared by Just Women's Sports (@justwomenssports)

The USWNT officially ends 2025 with 12 wins, three losses, and zero draws, tying the team record for most home defeats in a calendar year while shaking up the player pool and honing their style of play.

""I watched the product in the last two games, and I'm like '[Italy] was a team that nearly made the [2025] Euro final,'"" USWNT manager Emma Hayes said postmatch. ""We've got patience, we could control the game in the right moments, we can attack in a variety of different ways…for me the pride is in all of it.""

""It's what we're striving for every game,"" said 19-year-old midfielder Claire Hutton, one of three teenagers to start Monday's friendly. ""We want to put more goals up — two isn't enough for us — but if we can end in a shutout and with a win, it puts us on the front foot going into January.""

After a brief break, the USWNT will return to action with a pair of friendlies next month, kicking off their 2026 campaign against No. 41 Paraguay on Saturday, January 24th, before taking on a still-unknown opponent on Tuesday, January 27th.

The US's first match of 2026 will kick off at 5:30 PM ET, airing live on TNT and HBO Max.

Monday's AP Top 25 women's college basketball poll has a new No. 2, as Texas jumped two spots up the ladder after taking down then-No. 2 South Carolina and then-No. 3 UCLA at last week's Players Era Championship in Las Vegas.

With the Longhorns knocking off two Top 3 programs in the shortest time frame in 25 years, the 32-member media panel rewarded Texas with 10 first-place votes on Monday.

Despite their losses, the No. 3 Gamecocks and No. 4 Bruins fell just one spot each, with UCLA bouncing back against then-No. 14 Tennessee on Sunday — a 99-77 victory that sent the Vols tumbling five spots to No. 19 in the week's biggest rankings drop.

Meanwhile, Nos. 5 through 10 held steady this week, as No. 5 LSU, No. 6 Michigan, No. 7 Maryland, No. 8 TCU, No. 9 Oklahoma, and No. 10 Iowa State all managed to avoid upsets.

The Big Ten and SEC are now neck-and-neck atop NCAA basketball, with both conferences featuring eight Top 25 teams after a narrow win over No. 25 West Virginia last Wednesday saw No. 23 Ohio State enter the AP Poll for the first time this season.

The ranked action will continue with a trio of Top 25 matchups on the second day of the annual ACC/SEC Challenge on Thursday.

First at 7 PM ET, No. 11 UNC will visit No. 2 Texas on ESPN2 while No. 3 South Carolina faces No. 22 Louisville on ESPN.

No. 18 Notre Dame will close out the night against No. 13 Ole Miss at 9 PM ET, airing live on ESPN2.

Spain star Aitana Bonmati is out for the rest of the 2025/26 season due to injury, after the Barcelona midfielder fractured her left fibula on Sunday while training for the second leg of La Roja's 2025 Nations League finale against Germany.

The reigning three-time Ballon d'Or winner immediately departed her national team camp to return to Barcelona for further injury testing, with the Liga F club confirming on Tuesday morning that Bonmati underwent a ""successful surgery"" and will likely miss five months of play while recovering.

A post shared by Just Women's Sports (@justwomenssports)

With the 27-year-old notching six goals and three assists for her club so far this season, Barcelona will first take the pitch without their superstar for five matches this month — including a pair of 2025/26 UEFA Champions League bouts against Portugal's Benfica and France's Paris FC.

Meanwhile, though Bonmatí featured in world No. 1 Spain's 0-0 first-leg draw with No. 5 Germany on Friday, the already short-handed defending Nations League champions must now contend without their midfield standout in a winner-take-all second-leg match for the 2025 trophy on Tuesday.

The 2025 UEFA Nations League final between No. 1 Spain and No. 5 Germany will kick off at 12:30 PM ET on Tuesday, with live coverage on Paramount+.

A new simulation of the 2026 FIFA World Cup group stage draw handed the U.S. men's national team an immediate challenge, while the other two host nations, Mexico and Canada, could also be in for difficult games.

The official World Cup group stage draw takes place on Friday, with supporters from around the world preparing to learn the fates of their country. 42 of the 48 participants are confirmed, and they will learn their first three opponents for the tournament when the draw takes place—those still to contest the playoffs in March will also know what awaits them should they get through.

All countries heading to North America next summer are hopeful of avoiding one thing: the dreaded group of death.

And a new mock draw conducted by Sports Illustrated has handed Mauricio Pochettino and his USMNT side a difficult, yet manageable route through to the knockout stages.

Group D

USA

Croatia

Tunisia

New Zealand

The U.S. is joined by Croatia, Tunisia and New Zealand in Group D.

Led by Luka Modrić, Croatia would represent a difficult challenge early in the tournament. On the flipside, it could be the perfect test to see how prepared the USMNT truly is. Croatia finished third and second respectively at the last two World Cups and can never be counted out. 

As far as marquee matchups go, Christian Pulisic battling his AC Milan teammate would certainly meet the criteria.

Pochettino and his men would likely fancy their chances of at least finishing second if they draw Tunisia and New Zealand. The former failed to advance past the group stage in 2018 and 2022, while the latter have qualified for their first World Cup since 2010.

The Croatia game would probably determine who tops Group D.

Here are the rest of the groups from the latest Sports Illustrated simulation ahead of the real thing:

(Check out our previous simulation here!)

Group A

Mexico

Colombia

Scotland

Jordan

Host nation Mexico is drawn against Colombia, Scotland and Jordan—a difficult group that threatens El Tri's chances of advancing to the bracket.

Colombia will be led by Bayern Munich star Luis Díaz, hoping to go one step further than a runner-up finish in the 2024 Copa América. Scotland features established talents like Andy Robertson, Scott McTominay and Kieran Tierney. Given the nature of their last-minute qualification, Scotland will be relishing their opportunity to perform next summer.

A win against Jordan, a first-time qualifier, could see Mexico through as a third-place team. A draw could bring their tournament to an early end.

Group B

Canada

Morocco

Saudi Arabia

Italy, Northern Ireland, Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina

Canada's simulated opponents include Morocco, Saudi Arabia and an undetermined playoff team—Italy, Northern Ireland, Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina. 

Morocco looks to improve on their fourth place finish from 2022, while Saudi Arabia notably pulled off the upset of that tournament beating Argentina in the group stage.

Whoever joins the Group B field would massively influence the third host nation's chances of advancing. If it's Italy, Canada could be eliminated from the group stage. The other three wouldn't necessarily be walks in the park either.

Group C

Argentina

Australia

South Africa

Haiti

Argentina would be licking their lips if this is their group next summer. 

The reigning World Cup champions would, barring some catastrophic occurrence, be heavily favored to top this group. Given Argentina wouldn't meet Spain, the other tournament favorite, until the final based on the group stage draw rules, Lionel Messi could be primed for a Hollywood ending to his international career.

Group E

Portugal

Iran

Panama

Cabo Verde

The World Cup is often used as the one trophy against Cristiano Ronaldo's legendary career. He might not need to win it, at least in his mind, but adding the most prestigious international honor to his cabinet would certainly reignite the greatest of all time debate.

Portugal was drawn against Iran, Panama and Cabo Verde. If this group comes to light, Ronaldo should top this group all things considered.

Group F

Germany

Uruguay

Qatar

Ghana

Germany, on paper, have the talent to go deep in 2026, although lifting the trophy might be one step too far forJulian Nagelsmann right now. But simulated opponents in Uruguay and Ghana would offer litmus tests straight away. If they top their group, Die Mannschaft could be in for a memorable summer.

On the other hand, unfavorable results could doom the 2014 winners to a third-place finish and a difficult knockout stage run.

Group G

Brazil

Senegal

Norway

Ukraine, Sweden, Poland or Albania

Brazil, Senegal and Norway would already represent the group of death at any World Cup. Throw Ukraine, Sweden or Poland into the mix and you've got the most exciting matches of the opening round.

This proposed group is full of star talents like Vinicius Junior, Sadio Mane, Erling Haaland and more. If Sweden joins, then there's Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyökeres. Poland would introduce Robert Lewandowski in likely his final World Cup ever. 

It's near impossible to predict how this group would play out, but have popcorn on standby if it becomes reality.

Group H

Netherlands

Japan

Paraguay

Denmark, North Macedonia, Czechia or Republic of Ireland

The Netherlands nearly upset eventual winners Argentina in 2022 losing on penalties. Wout Weghorst's heroics in extra time only delayed elimination and the Oranje will be eager to prove themselves in North America. 

Japan, Paraguay and a playoff team of either Denmark, North Macedonia, Czechia or the Republic of Ireland certainly offer a talented side like Netherlands the platform to top their group and go on a run.

Group I

France

Austria

Algeria

Curaçao

It's Didier Deschamps's last go at the World Cup with France in 2026. Les Bleus nearly became the first team since Brazil in 1958 and 1962 to win consecutive World Cups, losing to Argentina in the 2022 final in a tense penalty shootout.

France remain one of the most talented, if not the most talented team on paper heading in 2026. Given the emotional nature of Deschamps's final tournament, France should not be overlooked as a potential winner.

Group J

Spain

Switzerland

Egypt

Iraq, Bolivia or Suriname

Lamine Yamal knows very well if he helps Spain win a World Cup next summer he could become the youngest Ballon d'Or winner of all time. The Barcelona prodigy is already a superstar at the club and national team levels and Spain are absolutely loaded with talent.

The Euro 2024 winners are a favorite to go all the way next summer, with a simulated group of Switzerland, Egypt and one of Iraq, Bolivia or Suriname offering important tests along the way.

Group K

England

Ecuador

Uzbekistan

DR Congo, New Caledonia or Jamaica

Thomas Tuchel was brought in to take England one step further than Sir Gareth Southgate's iterations of the Three Lions. 

Back-to-back runner-up finishes at the Euros, combined with a quarterfinal exit in Qatar, have the country believing football could truly be coming home. 

Ecuador would be England's toughest test here. That game could easily determine who finishes top in Group K, while Uzbekistan and a playoff side of either DR Congo, New Caledonia or Jamaica hope they can amass enough points to move on as a third-place team.

Group L

Belgium

South Korea

Ivory Coast

Türkiye, Romania, Slovakia or Kosovo

Group L could easily be tagged as another group of death.

Belgium's golden generation might not have the silverware it hoped to conquer, but there are still heaps of talent in the squad. South Korea and Son Heung-min will likely have a massive following throughout the tournament given how the latter exploded onto the MLS scene with LAFC. 

If Türkiye joins Ivory Coast and company, fans won't want to miss out on Group L. If it's Romania, Slovakia or Kosovo, predicting who advances might be a little easier.

The group classification of the 48 teams at next year's World Cup finals will be determined at the FIFA draw in the US.

By Andrew Semple and News Agencies

The FIFA World Cup draw is an event that comes around only once every four years – but it can do plenty to determine a football nation's morale heading into the sport's most prestigious global competition.

The 2026 tournament – to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico – features a record 48 teams, with this draw adding a few new tweaks to spread out the contenders from the pretenders.

Here is all you need to know before the all-important little plastic balls are allocated to their pots:

The draw will begin at the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, on Friday, December 5, at 12 noon (17:00 GMT).

The draw will begin with Pot 1 and the 12 seeded teams, as determined by FIFA, being drawn into Groups A to L. These teams comprise:

The process will then continue with Pots 2, 3, and 4, in that order, FIFA explained.

Six more World Cup spots remain to be filled among the 22 nations still in contention through the playoffs in March.

Italy, four-time World Cup winners and 12th in the FIFA rankings, are in the playoffs and could find themselves in Pot 4 if they qualify.

Debutants Uzbekistan are in Pot 3, while fellow first-timers Jordan, Cape Verde and Curacao are in Pot 4.

Each nation's name is printed on a slip of paper, which is then folded and placed inside a plastic ball numbered 1 to 4 to represent one of the four pots.

Draw representatives mix up the balls in large glass bowls (pots) – and then extract one ball at a time from each pot to form the groups.

The three host nations have predetermined groups: Mexico in Group A, Canada in Group B, and USA in Group D.

The other top nine FIFA-seeded nations will be spread across the remaining nine groups: C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, and L.

There is less certainty for the remaining 36 teams, but specific rules do apply:

The 2026 World Cup draw rewards the four highest-ranked teams – Spain, Argentina, France and England – who will be placed in separate sections, or quadrants, of a new tennis-style seeded tournament bracket.

FIFA said the top four nations, if they finish top of their respective round-robin groups, will avoid each other until the semifinals.

Defending champions Argentina (No 2 ranked) with Lionel Messi and top-ranked European champions Spain (No 1 ranked) with Lamine Yamal, therefore, can ensure they do not meet until the final at MetLife Stadium near New York.

Forty-two of the 48 teams have now qualified for the World Cup, with the remaining six nations to be determined in March 2026.

Teams will be randomly drawn from each of the four pots and assigned to one of the 12 groups in Friday's draw:

Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (three host nations and nine top-seeded)

Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia

Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Uzbekistan, Qatar, South Africa

Pot 4: Jordan, Cape Verde, Ghana, Curacao, Haiti, New Zealand, European playoff winners A, B, C and D, Intercontinental playoff winners 1 and 2

 



 

Iran has decided to boycott the World Cup draw because the US denied visas to members of its delegation, the state-run IRNA news agency reported on Friday.

The agency quoted Iranian football federation spokesman Amir-Mahdi Alavi as saying that officials faced visa obstacles that go beyond sporting considerations.

There was no immediate comment from the White House.

Alavi said the federation had reached out to FIFA and hoped it could help resolve the issue.

President Donald Trump's administration announced in June a travel ban on citizens from 12 countries, including Iran, although exemptions were promised for “any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the secretary of state”.

It is unclear whether the exemptions also apply to the World Cup draw.

Live coverage of the 2026 World Cup draw will be provided on FIFA.com and the FIFA World Cup social media channels. The draw will also be broadcast by FIFA's media partners.

Al Jazeera Sport will provide live text commentary of the draw.

The draw will divide the 48 qualified and play-off-bound teams into 12 groups of four, using FIFA's latest men's world rankings to allocate nations into four pots.

One team from each pot will be drawn into every group.

The three co-hosts — Canada, Mexico and the United States — are allocated to Pot 1. The nine top teams in the current FIFA rankings are also placed in Pot 1.

The next three pots were decided by the FIFA rankings, with the lowest-ranked qualified teams in Pot 4. The 12 groups for the World Cup will then be formed by one team from each pot.

FIFA's draw constraints state that, in principle, no group may contain more than one team from the same confederation, with the exception of UEFA, which must have at least one but no more than two European teams in each group. In addition, the top four teams in the FIFA rankings – Spain, Argentina, France and England – cannot face each other until the semi-finals, provided they win their groups.

Forty-two of the 48 tournament places have been secured, with the remaining six to be decided in late March 2026 via four European play-offs and a two-path inter-confederation play-off tournament. Those six play-off winners, along with the play-off placeholders at the time of the draw, are all assigned to Pot 4.

The draw will also confirm the pathways through the tournament, with group placings mapped into the expanded 32-team knockout phase (Round of 32 onwards) that follows the group stage.

Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany.

Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Islamic Republic of Iran, Republic of Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia. 

Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa.

Pot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde , Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, four European play-off teams, two intercontinental play-off teams

The FIFA World Cup 2026 draw will be held on Friday 5 December 2025 at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., beginning at 12:00 local time (17:00 GMT). FIFA will confirm group placements during the live ceremony, including the positions of the three co-host nations.

Following the draw, FIFA is scheduled to release the full tournament match schedule — including venues and kick-off times — in a separate broadcast on Saturday 6 December.

The FIFA World Cup 2026 draw will be streamed live worldwide on FIFA's official digital platforms, including FIFA.com and the organisation's YouTube and social media channels.

And the higher pot you're placed in the easier draw you get. In theory. 

Below is a look at the 42 teams who have qualified and which pot they are set to be in for the draw, while the there are still six teams who join them via the playoffs in Europe and the inter-confederation tournament. 

This very helpful explainer from our own Nick Mendola goes through the details on exactly how the 2026 World Cup draw will work. 

But how are teams placed in each of the four pots? Basically, it's based on FIFA's world ranking system as to which pot each team will be placed in. 

With the new FIFA men's rankings out, FIFA have used these world rankings for the 2026 World Cup draw. 

FIFA will place the six teams who will advance to the tournament via the playoff route in Pot 4. Thus ignoring their FIFA ranking and sitting up the potential for some very strong groups.

All you need to know as we wait to discover which teams will face each other in next year's global tournament

As anticipation builds ahead of Friday's World Cup draw, football writer Ben Bloom looks at all the key points you need to know.

The World Cup draw will take place on Friday, 5 December, at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time). It will be held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC, United States. While the overall show will last longer, the draw itself is expected to take around 45 minutes to complete.

For the first time, the World Cup has been expanded to a 48-team tournament. So far, 42 nations have secured their places, representing six different regional confederations: AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), CONCACAF (North America, Central America, Caribbean), CONMEBOL (South America), OFC (Oceania) and UEFA (Europe).

There are 22 nations still in the running to claim one of the six remaining places. Four of those spots will be determined through the UEFA playoffs, with the other two assigned via FIFA's inter-continental playoffs.

Co-hosts: Canada, Mexico, United StatesAFC: Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, UzbekistanCAF: Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, TunisiaCONCACAF: Curacao, Haiti, PanamaCONMEBOL: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, UruguayOFC: New ZealandUEFA: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, England, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Switzerland

All 48 countries (the 42 that have already qualified, plus the six unclaimed playoff spots) have been divided into four pots of 12 teams according to the FIFA world rankings.

Co-hosts Canada, Mexico and the United States will be allocated to pot 1, alongside the highest-ranked nations. All six playoff winners will be placed in pot 4.

Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, United States, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany

Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia

Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa

Pot 4: Jordan, Cape Verde, Ghana, Curacao, Haiti, New Zealand, 4 x UEFA playoff winners, 2 x FIFA inter-continental playoff winners

The draw will begin with all 12 teams from pot 1 drawn sequentially into 12 World Cup groups lettered A to L. It is already known that Mexico will be assigned to position A1, Canada to B1 and the United States to D1.

The remaining nine top-ranked teams in pot 1 will be allocated position 1 of the group into which they are drawn. Once those 12 teams have been placed, the draw will continue through the same process for the teams in pot 2, 3 and 4.

No group may have more than one team from the same confederation – for example, Brazil and Argentina cannot be placed in the same group. This ruling applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. As there are 12 groups, each group will feature at least one European team but no more than two.

As we do not yet know which confederations the winners of FIFA's playoffs will be from, restrictions will apply to all three teams within each of the two playoff pathways.

What that means is the placeholder for the FIFA playoff 1 winner (featuring New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo) cannot be drawn into a group with CONCACAF or African teams. The FIFA playoff 2 winner (featuring Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq) will avoid South American, CONCACAF and Asian teams.

Yes, for the first time ever at a World Cup, FIFA have opted to keep the top four highest-ranked nations apart in separate pathways, ensuring that – should they all win their groups – they will not meet each other until at least the semi-finals.

That means Spain (1) and Argentina (2) will be paired and placed on opposite sides of the draw, with the same applying to France (3) and England (4).

 All the playoff fixtures consist of one leg and will be played in March 2026.

The UEFA playoff teams have been divided into four pathways, each featuring two semi-finals and a final.

Path A semi-finalsItaly v Northern IrelandWales v Bosnia-Herzegovina*

Path B semi-finalsUkraine v Sweden*Poland v Albania

Path C semi-finalsTurkey v RomaniaSlovakia v Kosovo*

Path D semi-finalsDenmark v North MacedoniaCzech Republic v Republic of Ireland*

*Winners of the asterisked semi-finals on 26 March will be at home in the final on 31 March.

The six teams in the FIFA inter-continental playoffs were divided into two pathways, with DR Congo and Iraq given byes to the finals based on their status as the two highest-ranked playoff nations.

Semi-final: New Caledonia v JamaicaFinal: DR Congo v winners of above semi-final

Semi-final: Bolivia v SurinameFinal: Iraq v winners of above semi-final

Although Friday's draw will determine the composition of each group, it will not be until Saturday, 6 December, that full details are confirmed, namely the finalised match schedule, kick-off times and locations of each match.

The only exceptions are groups A (Mexico), B (Canada) and D (United States), which contain the three co-hosts and have been guaranteed to play all their matches at certain stadiums within their home countries.

The World Cup's opening stage consists of 12 groups of four teams, who play each fellow member of their group once. The top two teams in each group qualify for the knockout stage, which begins with a round of 32.

As eight additional teams are required to make up this new round – taking place at a World Cup for the first time – all 12 third-placed teams from the group stage will be ranked, with the top eight progressing.

From there, the tournament follows a conventional knockout format of round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals and final.

The tournament will begin on 11 June and conclude with the final at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium on 19 July.

Of the 42 countries who are already guaranteed a place at the World Cup, 35 have players registered with clubs in this season's Premier League.

The overseas countries who have the most players registered with Premier League clubs are France (40 players), Netherlands (36) and Brazil (31), who have a league-high seven players at Nottingham Forest.","{'href': 'https://www.premierleague.com', 'title': 'Premier League'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Igor Thiago: The rise of Brentford's goal machine challenging Erling Haaland for the Golden Boot and battling for Brazil starting spot at the World Cup","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/igor-thiago-brentford-goal-machine-challenging-erling-haaland-golden-boot-battling-brazil-starting-spot-world-cup/blt3bae7aee93e713a4","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Brentford have a remarkable record when it comes to replacing their star players. Over the last six years, the Bees have continued to progress despite seeing the likes of Ezri Konsa, Ollie Watkins, Said Benrahma, Neal Maupay, David Raya and Ivan Toney all move on, thanks to the meticulous work of the club's recruitment department. Their latest success story is Brazilian powerhouse Igor Thiago, who has emerged as a genuine rival to Erling Haaland for the Premier League's Golden Boot during the first half of the 2025-26 campaign.

Many tipped Brentford to be fighting a relegation battle after the summer departures of talismanic attacking duo Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa, club captain Christian Norgaard and beloved manager Thomas Frank. Keith Andrews made the step up from set-piece coach to succeed Frank, and was deemed to be lacking the necessary experience and squad depth to keep the team competitive at the highest level.

But Andrews has defied his doubters by embracing the same direct style of play as Frank and placing his trust in Thiago to lead the line. The 24-year-old has netted 11 goals in 13 Premier League games - just three shy of Haaland's tally in Manchester City colours - to propel Brentford back into the top half of the table as he almost single-handedly plugs the gap left by Mbeumo and Wissa.

Aston Villa, Tottenham and Newcastle are all now reportedly interested in signing Thiago, and talk of a maiden Brazil call-up is growing with each passing game. He could even jump to the front of his country's No.9 queue ahead of the 2026 World Cup if he can deal a major blow to Arsenal's title hopes when Brentford make the short trip to the Emirates on Wednesday.

Thiago grew up in Gama, Brazil, but didn't immediately pick up the football bug. “I was eight or nine when I started playing,” he recently told Brentford's official website. “I gradually started to gain the love of football. It mostly was my brother taking me at the weekend to games. I then saw Cristiano Ronaldo playing for Manchester United and that was the biggest thing. I saw Ronaldo playing and I said, ‘I want to be like him'.""

He started honing his skills at local club Vere FC, but Thiago's journey towards the professional game was put on hold after he tragically lost his father aged just 13. He would go on to work as a grocery carrier and bricklayer to support his mother, which shaped his strong character: ""It helped me as a man, and it helped me as person. It helped me to appreciate the little and big things in life, because today I look at my life and see that I'm privileged with everything I have.""

Cruzeiro eventually handed Thiago his big break as an 18-year-old, and he scored 10 goals in 64 appearances for the club, attracting attention from Europe in the process. Bulgarian outfit Ludogorets snapped him up in March 2022, and he quickly adapted to life on a new continent.

Thiago notched a combined 32 goals and assists as Ludogorets claimed successive league titles, along with the Bulgarian Cup and Supercup. By the summer of 2023, Thiago had outgrown Ludogorets, and they sold him to Club Brugge for €8 million - a Parva Liga record fee.

Thiago repaid Brugge's investment tenfold in his first and only campaign in Belgium. He scored 29 goals in 55 appearances across all competitions in 2023-24, with 18 of those coming in a prolific run through December and January, as Brugge clinched the Pro League crown and reached the semi-finals of the Conference League.

The Brazilian picked up the Young Player of the Season award in the latter competition, with former Brugge boss Ronny Deila left delighted by his impact: ""Thiago brings something to the team we didn't have before. Defenders hate playing against him. He presses non-stop, runs all the time and kicks them. Apart from that, he's also a top bloke, both on the pitch and in the dressing room. He should be capable of playing for a top outfit.""

Brentford gave Thiago the chance to make good on that billing when breaking their transfer record to bring him to the Gtech Community Stadium that summer in a £30m ($40m) deal. Frank described it as a ""proactive"" move from the club after resigning himself to the exit of Toney, adding: ""Thiago is a very exciting striker who fits the role in our team. He is hard-working and a very good pressing player. He is also a physical presence, very good in the box and can link the play. There is big potential.""

Unfortunately, a cruel injury blow would prevent Thiago from unlocking that potential in what turned out to be a testing start to his life in England.

In his very first game for Brentford, a 5-2 pre-season win over AFC Wimbledon, Thiago suffered a meniscus injury, and immediately went under the knife. He was forced to sit out Brentford's first 11 Premier League games of 2024-25 as a result, eventually making his competitive debut in a 0-0 draw with Everton on November 23.

The Cruziero academy graduate featured from the bench again in subsequent outings against Leicester City and Aston Villa before impressing on his first start as Brentford beat Newcastle 4-2 at the Gtech. He was then sidelined again, however, after picking up an infection in his knee, much to the frustration of Frank.

""The risk of getting a joint infection is very, very small, but apparently it's the opposite when you are a Brentford player; instead of a two per cent chance it's a 98 per cent chance,"" said the Bees boss.

Thiago did not return until early May, and was only fit enough to make cameo appearances in Brentford's final four league fixtures. From the outside, it looked like a case of a dream transfer turning into a nightmare, but remarkably, Thiago was able to find enough positives that made him confident about his future.

""It was a big learning season for me, learning my body and how everything reacts. It was a hard season in terms of not being able to play, but a good season for learning how my body works,"" he said. ""I thought moving to England would be harder than it was, to be honest, but everything went well.""

Thiago scored the first goal of the Andrews era in a pre-season clash with Gil Vicente, and finally opened his competitive account in Brentford's opening game of the new Premier League campaign, converting a penalty in a 3-1 defeat at Nottingham Forest. He doubled his tally in a 2-1 reversal at newly-promoted Sunderland, powering a header in off the bar after stealing in between two defenders to meet a Frank Onyeka cross, but Brentford were languishing down in 17th towards the end of September with only four points amassed from a possible 15.

The tide turned, though, when Andrews' side welcomed Manchester United to the Gtech. Brentford pulled off a thrilling 3-1 upset, and Thiago was the star of the show. He rifled a thunderbolt of a half-volley into the top corner to open the scoring before making it 2-0 with a reactive close-range finish inside the first 20 minutes, while excelling throughout the contest with his skills as a target man, bullying the United defence into submission.

Since then, Thiago has been an unstoppable force of nature. He also scored the winning goal against Liverpool in October, and bagged two more braces in victories over Newcastle and Burnley. Even when on the periphery of games, the towering striker always poses a huge threat, as the Clarets learned to their peril on Saturday. Thiago came to life in the final 10 minutes of the match, first dispatching another penalty before smashing in the all-important second goal from a Jordan Henderson delivery, albeit with the aid of a deflection.

Thiago has built up a good relationship with Henderson, as well as fellow attackers Dango Ouattara and Kevin Schade, which is reaping great rewards for the Bees. He is clinical when he gets a sight of goal, both on the ground and in the air, but is also a selfless centre-forward who looks to bring others into play at every opportunity.

""Everything we stand for can be seen in abundance in Thiago,"" Andrews said after the Burnley win. ""I just love the way he plays the game.""

Thiago has scored more penalties than any other player in the Premier League this term (five), but is also third for goals from open play behind Haaland and Brighton's Danny Welbeck. The statistics suggest his incredible form will continue, too, because he ranks second for shots on target (19). 

Incredibly, Brentford's new talisman, who now boasts his own fan chant based on Spandau Ballet's iconic track 'Gold', is only four goals away from equalling the record for the most goals scored by a Brazilian in a single Premier League campaign, which is currently shared by Roberto Firmino, Gabriel Martinelli and Matheus Cunha (15). It would be a huge shock if Thiago doesn't surpass that mark given Brentford still have 25 games left to play, and it probably won't be long before he is rubbing shoulders with Martinelli and Cunha in the national team, either. Indeed, Andrews has already confirmed that Brazil head coach Carlo Ancelotti has been in touch to discuss Thiago's progress.

""He's a joy to coach and be around. He savours every second he's on the grass and in the games he's a real competitor. There's been contact from Brazil,"" Andrews revealed last week. ""They're very aware of his qualities and it's a big dream for him. So hopefully we can work together to one day make that happen.""

Ancelotti is blessed with strength in depth upfront that few other countries can match. Alongside Cunha and Martinelli, household names such as Vinicius Jr, Raphinha and Rodrygo are all competing for minutes, along with Chelsea wonderkid Estevao, while injury-plagued legend Neymar has an outside chance of making the World Cup squad if he can prove his fitness at Santos in the coming months.

That does not mean that Thiago's dream is unrealistic, though. The battle for the role of Brazil's first-choice striker is wide open, with Richarlison and Joao Pedro still struggling for consistency at Tottenham and Chelsea, respectively, and former Botafogo man Igor Jesus yet to find his feet at Nottingham Forest.

Ancelotti could opt to play with a false nine next summer, but as it stands, Thiago may be his best option. Brazil can turn on 'Joga Bonito' mode and blow away the lesser teams at the newly-expanded tournament, but against the more well-drilled sides, Thiago's presence could make the difference. When the ball goes up to him, it sticks, and he rarely makes the wrong decision.

His spatial awareness is an unsung aspect of his game, too. Thiago knows instinctively when and where to make penetrative runs. With a host of world-class players providing service, he could run riot in North America. Of course, it's impossible to say how Thiago would cope with the step up to the most prestigious stage in football and the pressure it brings, but he's exceeded expectations throughout his career, driven by unbreakable self-belief.

“It's my biggest goal,” Thiago affirmed when quizzed on a potential Brazil call-up. “When I reach there, which I will, it'll mean I've made it.” With that elite mentality, anything is possible.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

West Ham manager Nuno Espirito Santo insists that Lucas Paqueta is still affected by the spot-fixing investigation the Football Association (FA) opened against him last season. The midfielder was sent off at the weekend against Liverpool, and later hit out at the governing body for their conduct and their lack of support while the case was being looked into.

Paqueta was at the centre of a lengthy FA investigation into spot-fixing, which began in August of 2023, and saw the Brazil international charged in May of 2024. He was cleared of the allegations in July of 2025, bringing to an end a two-year ordeal in which the threat of a lifetime ban hovered above him, like a Sword of Damocles. The FA did warn Paqueta about his future conduct, and he was also reprimanded for failing to comply with the investigation, but he was allowed to return to the game and keep playing, having avoided any punishment. Nevertheless, at the weekend, Paqueta was sent off against Liverpool for dissent, and later claimed that he was not given the proper support by the game's governing body. 

After his red card, Paqueta wrote on social media: ""It's ridiculous to have your life and career affected for two years without any psychological support from the federation. Perhaps this ridiculous behaviour is just a reflection of everything I've had to endure and, it seems, have to continue enduring! I'm sorry I'm not perfect.""

He added: ""I understand that now I have to look like the villain; it's difficult to live with everything that has been caused in my life and in my mental health! I will continue trying to prevent them from affecting me even more.

""This does not justify my expulsion, and for that I apologise to the fans and my teammates!""

Now, Nuno has backed Paqueta's take that he is continuing to struggle with the fallout of the investigation, telling reporters: ""I think it [the investigation] is affecting him but he is willing to move forward, to try and put this aside and continue to play football in the way that he does.

""He is not OK. He is suffering, he is disappointed and upset. He realises the mistake that he made and he is willing to move forward. Sometimes people are not aware of the problems that football players endure. But I think [he] is going to overcome this situation.""

Because Paqueta was sent off as a result of two yellow cards, he will only be suspended for West Ham's forthcoming fixture against Manchester United. The Hammers sit 17th in the Premier League table and are only outside of the relegation zone due to goal difference. They have an identical record as Leeds in 18th, and are one point clear of Burnley in 19th. Losing a player as good as Paqueta, even if it is only for a game, is an undoubted blow, but Nuno did confirm that the playmaker is set to play against Brighton on Sunday.

He added: ""At the same time, everybody deserves a chance, and this is the case. We have to move forward. Lucas isn't available for the Manchester United game, but he will be involved in the next one.""

He also scotched any talk of Paqueta potentially completing a move to Manchester City, having been heavily linked with the club before the FA opened their investigation against him. 

West Ham will hope to put points on the board against United before taking on Brighton this weekend. Both of those games are away from home, before they take on Aston Villa at home on December 14. Paqueta has scored three goals in 12 games this season, and will be out to add to that tally once he returns.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'Barcelona fans would love him!'","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/barcelona-fans-love-bruno-fernandes-backed-for-shock-la-liga-transfer-positional-restrictions-man-utd/blt4b098a314cf676ef","Tue, 02 Dec 2025 16:06:43 GMT","

A former Barcelona midfielder has urged Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes to join the Catalan giants amid positional restrictions under Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford. The Portugal international has been deployed in a restricted role at the centre of the park alongside Casemiro in Amorim's starting lineup this season, instead of playing a part in a more attacking area of the pitch.

Fernandes was the only shining light at United's worst campaign in the Premier League's history last season. The Portuguese midfielder was the team's best performer and highest scorer with 19 goals and as many assists in 57 matches across all competitions. 

Despite a stellar campaign, Amorim decided to experiment with Fernandes' role in the team as in the current campaign, he has been placed in a two-man central midfield role alongside Casemiro. With the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the summer and Mason Mount's revival, Fernandes has been forced to play in a more defensive position this season, mostly in a 3-4-2-1 system. 

Speaking to Casinostugan, former Barcelona and Spain midfielder Gaizka Mendieta said: ""Look at Ilkay Gundogan. He came to Barca also in his thirties, so in terms of age, not too much to worry about if Bruno Fernandes wants the move. Talent-wise, he has all the time that he needs for a player to succeed in La Liga. It's obviously about how he feels about it. He's obviously the captain at Man Utd. Maybe the fact that he's not playing in a position where he would prefer could influence him. I cannot see why he couldn't go to La Liga, to Barca, especially. 

""Again, I think players love those challenges, different countries, different leagues, winning trophies in different leagues, and I'm sure it crossed his mind many times. But again, it's about ambition, it's about his situation there. In the same way I would love to see Vinicius Junior in the Premier League, I would love to see Fernandes in La Liga. Barcelona fans would love him, 100%. His character, both talent-wise and personality-wise.""

Saudi Pro League clubs have shown interest in Fernandes for a long time now, although interest in the midfielder was fended off in the last window, with United's club captain making no push for an exit from Old Trafford. He is tied to a contract through to 2027 that includes the option for a further 12-month extension.

Amid his transfer links to the Middle East, United have been told that they should not ignore any transfer offers from the Saudi Pro League. Former Red Devils star Wes Brown - speaking in association with BetWright casino - told GOAL: ""I think he will be. Regardless of what happens with Bruno, I know that he would really love to stay. At the same time, if stupid offers get brought in, what can you do? He's getting to that age now where he still wants to be part of it, but you can't just dismiss everything because that's not how the world works. I don't think anyone would take it too personally if that did happen. 

""He's done everything he can to try and help the team. At some point it will come to that crunch if someone comes in - probably talking Saudi with that money. If that happens again, whatever happens you can't blame Bruno. You have to accept that he did right by what he needed to do and then move on again. You need a player with that same energy. That's what people don't get - the same energy. Sometimes my mates say ‘he does this, he does that', which is because sometimes nobody else is doing anything! He's trying to do something. People don't understand that and get it, which is fine. But he is definitely a player that you need, or need someone like that. Not necessarily to replace, but in the same category. If he was to go, it would be a big miss.""

The 31-year-old suffered a late injury scare during United's comeback victory over Crystal Palace last weekend. However, Amorim eased concerns after the game, as he told TNT Sports: ""It was a kick. I was shouting at him, we made a substitution in the end. He needed to talk to the bench but he said it was just a kick so everything is okay.""

Fernandes is likely to return to action in the club's upcoming Premier League game against West Ham on Thursday at Old Trafford. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The TikTok video shows ICE agents appearing to detain and arrest undocumented people, with Carpenter calling it ""evil and disgusting"" in an X post on Tuesday (Dec. 2).

Editor's note: Shortly after this story posted, Carpenter condemned the clip online. Read more about what she said here. 


	While performing the song “Juno” on her recently wrapped Short ‘n Sweet tour, Sabrina Carpenter would “arrest” a fan or celebrity in the crowd in a fun moment involving pink prop handcuffs. The bit was a viral sensation during the outing that ended last month and it was accompanied by another viral favorite section where Carpenter would ask the crowd if they wanted to try out some “freaky positions,” before busting out a unique pose and saying “Have you ever tried… this one?”


	On Monday (Dec. 1), the White House once again appropriated a playful pop culture meme to shine a light on its attempt to deport undocumented people. In a 14-second TikTok video cued to “Juno,” a series of people are shown angrily filming ICE agents as they swoop in to arrest people on the street, with close-ups of handcuffs being slapped on someone. A series of clips of chases and arrests are then cued to Carpenter asking, “Have you ever tried this one?”

	The caption to the clip reads “Have you ever tried this one? Bye-bye [wave heart eyes emoji].”


Billboard reached out to the White House to clarify if it got clearance from Carpenter to use her music in the ICE propaganda video.


	The video dropped less than a month after Olivia Rodrigo lambasted the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security posted an Instagram video soundtracked by her Guts track “All-American Bitch” showing ICE officers forcibly tackling, detaining and deporting people. In the comments, Rodrigo wrote, “don't ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda.” The video featured a montage of what appeared to be undocumented people voluntarily boarding DHS flights and giving a thumbs-up as they depart. “LEAVE NOW and self-deport using the CPB Home app,” read the caption. “If you don't, you will face consequences.”

	











	Carpenter, a vocal supporter of Trump's 2024 election rival Vice President Kamala Harris, is the latest artist to object to the president's repeated use of popular music for his political videos without their permission. The pace of such seemingly unsanctioned usage has ramped up over the past few months, with Kenny Loggins lashing out at Trump for using his Top Gun classic “Danger Zone” under an AI-generated video of the president seemingly dumping a river of fecal matter on American citizens participating in the anti-Trump “No Kings” protests.


	Swifties also aired their ire at the White House last month over a TikTok video set to Swift's hit Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping single “The Fate of Ophelia,” renamed “The Fate of America,” depicting Trump's mug shot from when he was charged with trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election results as well as an image of POTUS kissing an American flag. While Swift — an avowed Harris supporter who Trump has repeatedly said he “hates” — has not commented on the seemingly unauthorized appropriation of her music, the White House sent a response to Variety in which it gloated about owning the libs.


	Representatives said they made the video specifically to get “fake news media brands” to “breathlessly amplify” their message. “Congrats, you got played,” the rep said.

Ahead of the full reveal on Dec. 9 — after the Billboard 2025 No. 1s Livestream, hosted by Druski — check out three R&B/hip-hop top 10s.


													By
												

	Keith Caulfield



	The full list of Billboard's 2025 year-end charts are almost here, and we're counting down the days to their unveiling on Tuesday, Dec. 9, with a special look at select rankings in the lead-up to the big reveal — and today (Dec. 2)., we have the top 10s of three of the year-end R&B/hip-hop charts.


	On Dec. 9, hundreds of year-end charts will be posted on Billboard's website, following the conclusion of the Billboard 2025 No. 1s Livestream, hosted by Druski, which will broadcast on the Billboard News YouTube channel and BillboardTV on Samsung TV Plus starting at noon ET/9 a.m. PT, as special surprise guests stop by to celebrate the year in chart-toppers.


	Today, we're dropping the top 10s of the 2025 Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and Hot R&B Songs charts.


Kendrick Lamar and SZA‘s “Luther” leads the year-end Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs roundup, following its unstoppable run on the weekly version of the chart. It debuted on the chart dated Dec. 7, 2024, climbed to No. 1 just two weeks later, and was on the chart during the rest of the 2025 chart year (Oct. 26, 2024, through Oct. 18, 2025), never falling below No. 3.


	SZA, meanwhile, crowns the year-end Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums recap, with a project that debuted on the weekly chart on Dec. 24, 2022 — SOS. It's the second time the title has finished atop the year-end Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, as it also reigned in 2023. (It was the No. 2 album of 2024.) The album's chart performance in 2025 was enhanced by its expanded reissue with additional songs in December 2024, dubbed SOS Deluxe: LANA. All versions of the album, old and new, are combined together with the original album for tracking and charting. During the 2025 chart year, SOS never left the chart, spent 15 weeks at No. 1, and never ranked below No. 6.


The Weeknd and Playboi Carti‘s “Timeless” tops the year-end Hot R&B Songs chart. The track premiered at No. 1 on the Oct. 12, 2024-dated Hot R&B Songs chart, and remained on the list through the July 19, 2025, chart. During that span, it spent 20 weeks atop the ranking, never going lower than No. 4. “Timeless” marked the 12th No. 1 for The Weeknd and the first for Playboi Carti.


	For the top 10 of the three lists, scroll below. The full depth of the three rankings (beyond the top 10s of each) will be posted Dec. 9 alongside the complete menu of Billboard‘s 2025 year-end charts.


	Billboard's year-end music charts represent aggregated metrics for each artist, title, label and music contributor on the weekly charts from Oct. 26, 2024, through Oct. 18, 2025. Rankings for Luminate-based recaps reflect equivalent album units, airplay, sales or streaming during the weeks that the entries appeared on a respective chart during the tracking year. Any activity registered before or after a title's chart run isn't considered in these rankings. That methodology detail, and the October-October time period, account for some of the difference between these lists and the calendar-year recaps that are independently compiled by Luminate.

Ahead of the full reveal on Dec. 9 – after the Billboard 2025 No. 1s Livestream, hosted by Druski – check out the Hot Rap Songs top 10.

	We're counting down the days to the unveiling of Billboard's 2025 year-end charts on Tuesday, Dec. 9, with a special look at select rankings in the lead-up to the big reveal — and today (Dec. 2), we have the top 10 of the 2025 Hot Rap Songs chart.


	On Dec. 9, hundreds of year-end charts will be posted on Billboard's website, following the conclusion of the Billboard 2025 No. 1s Livestream, hosted by Druski, which will broadcast on the Billboard News YouTube channel and BillboardTV on Samsung TV Plus starting at noon ET/9 a.m. PT, as special surprise guests stop by to celebrate the year in chart-toppers.


	Below, we're dropping the top 10 of the 2025 Hot Rap Songs chart — led by Kendrick Lamar and SZA‘s “Luther.” The track debuted at No. 3 on the weekly edition of Hot Rap Songs dated Dec. 7, 2024; rose to No. 1 on the Dec. 21, 2024, chart; and then never left the ranking during the rest of the 2025 chart year (Oct. 26, 2024, through Oct. 18, 2025-dated charts). During that span, it never ranked lower than No. 3, and that only happened in its debut week.


	For the top 10 of the list, scroll below. The full depth of the ranking (beyond the top 10) will be posted Dec. 9 alongside the complete menu of Billboard‘s 2025 year-end charts.


	Billboard's year-end music charts represent aggregated metrics for each artist, title, label and music contributor on the weekly charts from Oct. 26, 2024, through Oct. 18, 2025. Rankings for Luminate-based recaps reflect equivalent album units, airplay, sales or streaming during the weeks that the entries appeared on a respective chart during the tracking year. Any activity registered before or after a title's chart run isn't considered in these rankings. That methodology detail, and the October-October time period, account for some of the difference between these lists and the calendar-year recaps that are independently compiled by Luminate.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: The Duke is back. Bridgerton alum Regé-Jean Page is returning to Netflix as the star and executive producer of erotic thriller series Hancock Park. The project, which I hear landed at Netflix for development in a competitive situation with three major streamers bidding, comes from writer Matthew Barry (Industry), Drew Comins‘ Creative Engine (Yellowjackets) and Fifth Season. According to sources, it has been put on an accelerated development track with a script-to-series commitment.


Hancock Park is named after the historic and affluent Los Angeles neighborhood which counts Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos and Bridgerton executive producer Shonda Rhimes among longtime current and former residents.

	The series follows a dangerously charismatic outsider (Page), who invades the lives of a seemingly picture-perfect Los Angeles family when he rents their backyard guest house. But as he dives further into their world, the façade of this elite community begins to crumble, and he exposes the desire, deceit, and obsession that lurks around every corner of one of L.A.'s most-coveted neighborhoods.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In addition to writing, Barry is executive producing alongside Page and his producing partner Emily Brown through their A Mighty Stranger banner and Comins for Creative Engine. Fifth Season, where Comins has a first-look deal, is the studio.


	Page has the rare distinction of having both a series (Bridgerton Season 1) and a movie (The Gray Man) on Netflix's Top 10 most popular English-language lists. His starring role as the Duke of Hastings on the first season of Netflix's Regency romance drama catapulted Page into global stardom. He has been focused on movies since, starring in The Gray Man opposite Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, Steven Soderbergh's spy thriller Black Bag and Universal's upcoming romantic comedy You, Me & Tuscany, opposite Halle Bailey, which comes out in April.


	Through A Mighty Stranger, Page and Brown are developing a Count Of Monte Cristo movie at Department M for Page to star and Funny You Should Ask, a TV series adaptation of Elissa Sussman's best-selling novel, which is set up at Apple from Tomorrow Studios, also as a starring vehicle for Page. He is repped by UTA, Brillstein Entertainment Partners, attorney Gregory Slewett and Shelter PR.

	











	Welsh writer Barry served as a writer-producer on Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. He recently wrote Men Up, a Welsh TV movie for BBC One, which earned him a writing BAFTA Cymru Award, and the BBC miniseries The Guest. He is repped by WME and The Agency.


	At Netflix, Comins, two-time Emmy nominee for Yellowjackets, also has in the works the UK-based Dangerous Liaisons, from Mood creator and star Nicôle Lecky, which recently opened a writers room, a series adaptation of Adam Silvera's novel They Both Die at the End, with Bridgerton creator Chris Van Dusen writing and Bad Bunny producing, and Lena Dunham's Covers. Additionally, The Holdout, starring Amy Adams, is in development at HBO with Industry creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, and The Stowaway, starring Oscar Isaac, at Apple TV. Comins is repped by CAA and attorney Patti Felker.

Lisa Rinna made one of her most dramatic red carpet appearances to date, turning heads for both her outfit and her atypical glam.

Attending the 2025 British Fashion Awards on Monday night, Rinna was the guest of designer Maximilian Raynor, modeling his sculptural creation on the red carpet.

Her glam team (including hair by Sam Elliot) took her to the next level with a bleached bouffant-style ‘do and bleached eyebrows to match, rendering the soap star nearly unrecognizable.

The ensemble was crafted using gingham plaid in a black-and-white pattern. It featured dramatic high shoulders and a peplum waist that merged into a fitted, thickly fringed skirt.

“It's head-to-toe couture, honey,” Rinna told The Perfect Magazine on the red carpet. “It is couture, but it's couture made to me … for me, by him,” she added as she gestured towards Raynor.

10 Magazine went behind the scenes before the event, chatting with Rinna and Raynor about the evening and — of course — the look.

“For me, someone who is in LA … to come to the British Fashion Awards is so iconic,” she said. “It's like … better than the Met Gala,” she quietly added.

“I said it! I think it's chicer than the Met Gala. Only … I've never been … but I would still like to do.”

The designer described the custom, couture look as “drama, glamour, LA meets London … sort of, like, vampish meets midcentury.”

Which is exactly what Rinna's retro-inspired hairstyle contributed to the vibe.

“It's in this amazing check that's kind of like your granddad's shirt, but taken and elevated,” he continued, adding, “It's really an exploration of that, but fused with the women's textiles of Maximilian Raynor.”

Though this might go down as one of the star's most dramatic red carpet looks, it isn't the first time that she changed her signature brunette bob to fit the moment.

Rinna attended the Viktor & Rolf Haute Couture fall 2025 show in Paris last summer, where she stepped out in a trench coat with a similarly oversized shoulder, bleached (and slightly purple) hair in a bouffant-style updo.

As for her latest head-turning look? 

“I'm very excited for Lisa to be the first to wear it,” Raynor shared.

It's convenient when a beloved, hard-to-access TV show is added in its entirety to a streaming library. Think of how excited we all were when every season of The Simpsons was added to Disney+ in 2019, making the whole show accessible. Think of how confused we then were when we realized that Disney+ uses a different aspect ratio than Fox did back in the 90s, leaving some sight gags neutered. Yesterday, HBO Max uploaded the entirety of Mad Men, which was exciting and confusing for a different reason: Instead of cropping jokes out of the frame, an error somewhere in the process has revealed far too much. 

As Bluesky user Paul Haine pointed out this morning, the remastered Mad Men has at least once left a props coordinator in the background of a shot. The scene comes in the series' seventh episode, “Red In The Face” (though it's incorrectly listed on the streamer as the series' sixth episode, “Babylon.”) Don Draper takes Roger Sterling out for a boozy lunch of oysters and then leaves him to climb the stairs back to the Sterling Cooper office, where Roger promptly vomits in front of some clients. In the version that currently sits on HBO Max, two men controlling the vomit hose are clearly visible in the background of the shot. As fellow Bluesky users Cooper Lund and Todd Vaziri point out, it doesn't seem to be an issue of cropping but of post-production; the frame seems pretty identical to the original, which is still in the 16:9 aspect ratio but doesn't include the vomit hose guy. 

When HBO announced the news that Mad Men was coming to streaming, a spokesperson shared that the company was thrilled to “provide fans the opportunity to enjoy the series in a fresh way with an enhanced 4K viewing experience.” There's no doubt about that. As of this writing, it's unclear what other surprises may lie in wait for these mad men; those fans embarking on a rewatch probably haven't made it much further than the series seventh episode on its first day of availability. We hear that the streamer is in the process of updating the files, but in the meantime, we hope vomit hose guy enjoys his newfound glory.

Wordless Music has partnered with A24 and the events company Sister Midnight on a year-long series of screenings with live film scores — and IndieWire shares the details exclusively below.

The series will feature Jonathan Glazer's “Under the Skin” (2013), Ti West's “Pearl” (2022 ), Ari Aster's “Hereditary” (2018), and Bo Burnham's “Eighth Grade” (2018). Billed as “Four Nights of A24 Films with Live Scores,” the series will run from February to December 2026 at the United Theater on Broadway in downtown Los Angeles. Tickets will go on sale this Friday, December 5, at 10:00 PST (links below).

 










Founded in 2006 by producer Ronen Givony, Wordless Music was created to get younger audiences to appreciate classical music through contemporary musicians. The mission organically branched into working with the world's best film composers on special-event film screenings with a live score. Previous Wordless screenings, which select what films to adapt to a live score through the lens of the “21st-century canon,” have included “There Will Be Blood,” “Punch-Drunk Love,” “Phantom Thread,” “Moonlight,” and by far the company's biggest production, “The Tree of Life.”

Currently, the Wordless Music Orchestra is on the road with Sigur Rós, but that tour will end in time for Givony and crew to be on stage for the following shows.

Language courtesy of the event.

“Under the Skin,” February 20, 2026A one-time-only presentation of Jonathan Glazer's 2013 sci-fi/horror classic, starring Scarlett Johansson, with an original score by composer Mica Levi, performed live to picture by 30 members of the Wordless Music Orchestra under conductor Derrick Skye.

“Pearl,” June 12, 2026The World premiere live score of Ti West's 2022 technicolor horror film, the second in the “X” trilogy starring Mia Goth, with an original score by co-composers Tyler Bates and Timothy Williams, will be performed live to picture by 40 members of the Wordless Music Orchestra, conducted by Williams.

“Hereditary,” October 23, 2026The world premiere live performance of Ari Aster's 2018 debut feature, with an original score by composer Colin Stetson, performed live, in full to picture by 40 members of the Wordless Music Orchestra and the composer himself on saxophone.

“Eighth Grade,” December 11, 2026A one-time-only presentation of Bo Burnham's 2018 comedy, with an original score by composer Anna Meredith, performed live to picture by a three-piece all-electronic ensemble.

 










Back in 2015, Wordless worked closely with composer Mica Levi on the live orchestra adaptation of her unorthodox “Under the Skin” score, which they are bringing for this series. It's an example of how Givony hopes the tremendous amount of initial legwork that goes into debuting a live event screening — including obtaining a scoreless print of the film and creating up-to-date sheet music to match it — lays the groundwork for there to be more special live orchestra screenings in the future.

“There's always an element of translation in bringing a score from the recording studio to the stage,” Givony told IndieWire. “In the case of ‘Hereditary'—most of which was recorded by Colin Stetson himself, using extended/non-traditional technique—we connected Colin with a gifted composer/arranger named Conor Brown, who helped to arrange and orchestrate the music for a live ensemble.”

The Wordless Music founder said the process is always unique for each film, but the one commonality is their insistence that the original composer be put in the driver's seat, having collaborated closely with the biggest names in film scores, like Levi, Jonny Greenwood, Dan Romer, Jon Brion, Nicholas Brittell, and Ludwig Goransson on previous live score “adaptations.”

 










Another key ingredient for Wordless is to stage events at unique venues, for which the United Theater on Broadway (formerly the Theatre at Ace Hotel) qualifies. The 1,600-capacity, ornate Spanish Gothic theater is a former movie palace founded by Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith, and Douglas Fairbanks, as part of their United Artists' attempt to break from the studios. A history Givony thinks dovetails nicely with the independent spirit with which these four A24 titles were made.

Tickets go on sale December 5 at 10:00 a.m. PST via this page. For more information, visit Sister Midnight.

Sean Combs sent Aubrey O'Day a string of sexually explicit emails and images of his penis while they were filming Making the Band, the singer alleges in a new Netflix documentary about the Bad Boy founder. 


	“I don't want to just fuck you, I want to turn you out,” O'Day reads aloud in Sean Combs: The Reckoning, which premiered today. “I can see you being with some motherfucker that you tell what to do. I make my woman do what I tell her to do, and she loves it. I just want and like to do things different. I'm-a finish watching this porn and finish masturbating. I'll think of you. If you change your mind and get ready to do what I say, hit me.” 


	The email, dated March 23, 2008, included Combs' standard signature at the time: “God bless. Diddy. God is the Greatest.” O'Day said she continually rebuffed Combs' sexual advances and was eventually kicked out of Danity Kane. “I absolutely felt that I was fired for not participating sexually,” she said in the film. 

	











	O'Day has long been vocal about her negative experience at Bad Boy, and the MTV reality show often highlighted Combs singling out O'Day over her appearance, what he believed was a bad attitude, and calling her “overly raunchy, promiscuous.” However, this is the first time the Danity Kane member has gone into detail about the alleged sexual harassment she faced off-camera. 


	It was only within the past two years, O'Day said, that she learned of an affidavit from a woman who claimed she had seen an incapacitated O'Day being sexually assaulted by Combs and another man in 2005. “I don't even know if I was raped,” O'Day added, stressing she had no recollection of the alleged assault. “And I don't want to know.” (A rep for Combs did not immediately reply to a request for comment.)

	











	O'Day's account is part of new revelations and allegations leveled against the disgraced mogul in the Netflix docuseries. It features interviews with former Bad Boy artist Mark Curry, Diddy-Dirty Money member Kalenna Harper, former staffer Capricorn Clark, Bad Boy co-founder Kirk Burrowes, and others. The four-part series includes never-before-seen footage of the night the Notorious B.I.G. was gunned down in March 1997, as well as a panicked 911 call as the rapper's friend raced him to the emergency room, where he was pronounced dead.

	Directed by Alexandria Stapleton and executive-produced by rapper Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, the project also obtained footage of a stressed Combs days before he was arrested on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. (The 56-year-old was acquitted of the more serious charges in July, but he was sentenced to 50 months in prison after being found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution charges.) 


	Combs' team have accused the streamer of using “stolen” material that was never authorized for release and labeled the documentary as a “shameful hit piece.” (Rolling Stone has reached out for comment on O'Day's accusations.)


	Here are five other takeaways from the docuseries:  


	Six days before Combs was arrested on federal criminal charges, footage he intended to use in his own documentary shows him strategizing with his sons, lawyers, then-chief of staff, and entourage on how to fight his quickly tarnishing reputation. The brief window into Combs' inner sanctum reveals him to be a master strategist, constantly thinking of how to control the narrative around him. 


	“He's creating a narrative, always,” explained Capricorn Clark, one of Combs' longtime and high-ranking Bad Boy employees. “He's the best storyteller in hip-hop. He thinks he's Black Superman, ‘I can do what I want.'”

	When discussing how current media coverage could prove damaging at trial, Combs ordered his team to find “somebody that has dealt in the dirtiest of dirtiest, dirty business of media and propaganda” to target potential jurors. He reasoned that some people might not watch CNN and that his team should look to social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram to reach his intended audience. 


	Spotting police officers on a nearby roof, Combs instructed his videographer to get “cutaway shots” of the uniformed officials. He organized a jaunt up to Harlem, smiling as he took pictures with fans and happily downing shots at a local bar. When he jumped back into his waiting SUV, Combs' mask dropped. “I need some hand sanitizer,” he said. “I've been out in the streets amongst the people. I gotta take a bath.” 

	











	“I began to see him use the culture only when he needed it,” said Combs' former head of security Roger Bonds. “Now you're walking around Harlem because you know that the world turned their back on you, so now you will come back home, hoping that Harlem got your back.”


	Combs was seen raging in real time when he learned of former Danity Kane and Diddy-Dirty Money artist Dawn Richard's lawsuit against him, declaring that the “gloves are off.” He directed people in his camp, including his adult son Justin, to circulate old clips of Richard praising him in interviews. He also called in a favor from Kalenna Harper, who was in the group Diddy-Dirty Money, begging her to release a statement disputing Richard's claims. (Harper eventually released a statement.) During pretrial hearings, Southern District of New York prosecutors pointed to Combs' repeated calls and texts to Harper as a form of witness tampering. (Combs' attorneys denied the accusation.) 


	For the first time, a man and woman who served as jurors at Combs' eight-week criminal trial over the summer explained why they acquitted Combs of sex trafficking his former girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura. Although both jurors conceded Combs was extremely violent toward the “Me & U” singer, one woman, identified only as Juror 160, reasoned that Combs wasn't charged with domestic violence. 


	The man, identified as Juror 75, said he couldn't understand why Ventura repeatedly went back to Combs. Using language similar to what Combs' attorney Marc Agnifilo used in his closing arguments as he beseeched the jury to find Combs innocent, the man said he believed the couple were deeply in love but locked in a toxic relationship. 


	“That was a very, very interesting relationship,” he explained. “This is two people in love; they are overly in love. You cannot explain. She wanted to be with him. He took her for granted. He never thought that she would leave him. So [it's] like both hands clapping together. You cannot clap with one hand, [you have to use] both hands, then you get the noise. 


	“Justice was served, 100 percent,” he added. “We saw both sides of it, and we came to our conclusions.” 


	After Ventura filed her bombshell sexual abuse lawsuit against Combs in November 2023, Joi Dickerson-Neal had two distinct feelings. The first was a deep sense of sadness for Ventura, and the second was relief: She wasn't alone. Dickerson-Neal quickly filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in New York, days before a special look-back window for previously time-barred complaints closed.  

	











	Speaking for the first time, Dickerson-Neal did not rehash her date with Combs in 1991, which allegedly ended in her being drugged and sexually assaulted. (Combs has denied her claims.) However, she produced a note that her mother had penned to Combs' mother, Janice, detailing how Dickerson-Neal woke up screaming from a nightmare she had about “Puffy.” 


	“I'm writing to inform you of something that your son did to my daughter that has greatly decreased the quality of her life and wreaked havoc on our entire family,” Dickerson-Neal read aloud from the letter, dated Nov. 26, 1992. “I realize that this may be hard for you to believe, but if I hadn't heard this story from my daughter's own mouth and looked into her eyes, I would have scarcely believed that any individual would compromise another person's dignity in this manner.


	“She said that he, without her knowledge, videotaped my daughter having sexual intercourse with him,” her mother wrote, adding that Dickerson-Neal suspected Combs showed the tape to “at least 60 or more” people. “Apparently, your son shows these tapes to all of his friends at parties on large screen televisions,” she wrote. “From what I understand, he has done this to several other girls.”


	Dickerson-Neal said she once bumped into Combs and confronted him about the alleged assault, but he dropped to his knees and denied everything. “When I think back in terms of his rise, it is the most helpless feeling,” Dickerson-Neal added, saying she once threw up when she saw an image of Combs in Times Square with his fist raised high in the air. “You are really raising your hand at victory, and I'm living in trauma and defeat.” 


	Over eight years, former male escort Clayton Howard claimed to have been hired by Combs and Ventura for freak-offs every few weeks, flying across the country to engage in dayslong sex sessions. 


	Howard said Combs was very particular, giving Ventura instructions and feedback about how she should be positioned, either granting or denying her permission on when she could move onto the next stage of the sexual encounter. He claimed to have witnessed numerous instances where Combs beat Ventura during the middle of a freak-off. “Every time she got assaulted, she would run out,” Howard said. “She would always come back.” 


	There was clear drug use during the freak-offs, Howard added. “I don't think I ever encountered Puff at a time where he wasn't high out of his face,” he recalled. “They used to lace the baby oil with GHB. He told me there was a little G in the baby oil.” (Both Combs and Ventura previously denied that there were drugs in the baby oil.) 

	











	Howard said “the weirdest thing” that occurred during the freak-offs was that “they used to physically collect my semen in a cup.” It was “creepy” to Howard, who finally asked what they were doing with it. Combs allegedly responded that he liked to watch Ventura “play with it and drink it.” 


	It also always stuck out to Howard that the couple would organize a freak-off every year on March 9 — the date of Notorious B.I.G.'s death. “I would hang out, drink, and party with them for three or four days while I had sex with Casandra,” he said. “I don't know if that was his release for that day or whatever, but they always called me on March 9.”

	The docuseries briefly highlights Combs' history of alleged violence with both men and former girlfriends, including Misa Hylton, Kim Porter, and Ventura. It also raises a new accusation from Bad Boy co-founder Kirk Burrowes, who claims Combs once became physical with his mother, Janice. 


	It was shortly after the City College of New York tragedy in December 1991, where nine people died in a stampede at a charity celebrity basketball event Combs organized. At the time, Combs was still a rising star at Uptown Records, and he was placed on administrative leave as officials investigated the incident. Depressed and holed up in a hotel, Burrowes said Janice asked Combs whether he was sure he wanted to continue in the music business and whether it was a wise choice for him. “I saw him put his hands on her, call her ‘bitch,' and slapped her,” Burrowes claimed.

Sabrina Carpenter called out the “inhumane agenda” of the Donald Trump administration after the White House used her song “Juno” in a social media video featuring ICE agents carrying out arrests. 


	Posted Monday, the 20-second clip opened with footage of people ostensibly protesting against ICE raids, before transitioning to a montage of agents appearing to chase down and detain allegedly undocumented immigrants. The caption quoted Carpenter's lyrics, “Have you ever tried this one? Bye-bye.”


	On X, Carpenter responded to the video, writing, “This video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.” (As of publication, the video was still up on the White House's X and TikTok accounts. A rep for Carpenter did not immediately return Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.)


	Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement to Rolling Stone, “Here's a Short n' Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: We won't apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country. Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?”

	The decision to use “Juno” in the White House clip felt especially pointed: During Carpenter's most recent tour, she would playfully “arrest” someone in the crowd with fuzzy pink handcuffs during her performances of the Short n' Sweet tune. 


	While it seems unlikely, based on her response, that Carpenter gave the White House permission to use “Juno,” it's unclear if she will be able to do anything about it. The complex web of music licenses that governs the use of copyrighted music on social media platforms could make it difficult for Carpenter to have the video removed on the grounds of copyright infringement.

	While Trump has angered plenty of artists over the years for using their music without permission, the Carpenter situation most closely resembles a recent flare-up between Olivia Rodrigo and the Department of Homeland Security. The agency similarly used her song “All-American Bitch” in a video also showing ICE agents conducting raids and arrests. 


	Rodrigo responded on Instagram, “Don't ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda,” but the video remains up. (Rodrigo's comment was also deleted, though it's unclear if it was removed by her or DHS.)

An effort aimed at conspiracy theorists follows the marketer enacting its first brand platform relaunch in a decade with Adam&eveDDB.

Columbia is taking a shot across the bow at conspiracy theorists with “Expedition Impossible,” a tongue-in-cheek take on social media challenges that asks flat-earthers to find the world's edge and snap a picture as proof. Press details emphasize that the “Edge of the Earth” within the contest parameters needs to be a literal drop off point into the infinite void, not just an impressive cliff face on a local hike.  

The company is putting assets valued at $100,000 on the line, inclusive of outdoor gear, office plants, mannequins and more. Boyle explains the stakes in humorous social videos where a lawyer intervenes to correct him about what the process for handing off the winnings would entail and employees act befuddled as he tries to showcase all that's at stake. 

“This is a message to Flat Earthers. I've seen your manifestos, admired your diagrams, watched you stand proudly on your, well, flat ground. So here's the deal: it's time to put your map where your mouth is,” writes Boyle in an open letter running in the Times. “Our gear is built to handle anything. So I'm inviting you to do what no one in history has ever done: find the edge of the Earth.”  

Boyle's message joins a tradition of outdoors brand executives making public statements on topical issues, albeit with a humorous twist. Taking flat-earthers to task could inspire online chatter about Columbia around the key holiday shopping period, and the brand will directly inject itself into online communities where farfetched ideas are heatedly discussed. That said, poking the conspiracy theorist bear also risks the potential for backlash from outspoken fringe types.

Conspiracy theories have increasingly bled into the cultural mainstream in an era of social media misinformation and distrust in legacy media. Flat Eartherism, in turn, has seen a 21st century resurgence, including among some celebrities, despite a surfeit of longstanding scientific and photographic evidence that the Earth is, in fact, spherical in shape. 

“Expedition Impossible” is part of Columbia's efforts to put forward bolder, conversation-starting marketing following its first brand platform relaunch in a decade. The marketer in August debuted “Engineered for Whatever,” a multiseason ad campaign that uses edgy, over-the-top humor to illustrate the toughness of its products under extreme conditions.

“Engineered for Whatever” is meant to serve as a counter to what Columbia views as overly pristine, idyllic outdoors marketing from rivals. Adam&eveDDB is the Portland, Oregon-based brand's global agency of record and helped develop “Expedition Impossible.”

A single dose of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine provided protection against RSV illness and associated healthcare use in nearly 290,000 older US veterans over two respiratory illness seasons compared with unvaccinated individuals; however, protection declined over time, particularly among immunocompromised individuals.

“Boosters may be needed, but for now, our efforts should be focused on saving lives and decreasing disease by encouraging vaccination of persons 75 years and older and those 60 years and older with underlying health issues,” experts wrote in an accompanying editorial.

The study was led by Kristina L. Bajema, MD, Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System, Portland, Oregon. It was published online on November 24, 2025, in JAMA Internal Medicine.

RSV documentation may have been incomplete for veterans who sought care outside the Veterans Health Administration. The cohort was predominantly White men, limiting generalizability. Residual confounding could not be excluded. Estimates of long‑term effectiveness should be interpreted cautiously because they reflect patients who remained in care and may differ from the original matched cohort. 

The study was supported by the US Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program, US Department of Health and Human Services, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and FDA. Two authors reported receiving grants from the study funder and/or the Patient‑Centered Outcomes Research Institute; one of these authors also reported co‑ownership of van Breemen & Hynes, LLC, unrelated to the submitted work.

Former Premier League star Luke Moore has told Wrexham fans that they shouldn't hold their breath over the prospect of promotion, as the club aim to find a way out of the Championship and into the promised land of the top-tier. The Welsh side have enjoyed back-to-back-to-back promotions from the National League, but Moore thinks they will simply run into too much resistance to climb out of the second-tier at the first time of asking. 

The Welsh club have enjoyed a staggering rise from non-league to within one more promotion of the Premier League. Phil Parkinson's side, though, have found it difficult as they attempt to adapt to the increased competition in a league that regularly features massive clubs dropping out of the top-flight with immense parachute payments behind them. Thus far this season, they sit 10th, having won six, drawn eight, and lost four of their 18 games. Parkinson's troops are just three points behind Bristol City in sixth, the final play-off spot, and are seven behind second-placed Middlesbrough. Leaders Coventry City are almost out of sight, sitting 17 points clear of Wrexham.

Moore is unsurprised that Wrexham have found the adaptation period difficult, and believes it would take a ""fairytale"" for them to win promotion and has praised the ""innovation"" of Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac.

He told BetVictor Casino: “It would be really a fairytale if they managed to get promoted this season. But the Championship is so hard to get out of, so I wouldn't hold my breath. But in terms of them as a club, they're doing incredible things. From what I hear, they're quite innovative in terms of how they are getting money through the door as well, which obviously helps them grow.

“The boys look like they're enjoying playing for the club. I think sometimes that's always the biggest indicator of how well a club's run or how healthy it is. I think it's a good thing and I think we need more team like Wrexham. I wouldn't call them a disturber, but they're making noise and they're making a mark, so you can't knock it.

“It's more the merrier in that sense, I think the clubs need to be more innovative of how they get fans to the games and put across their brand, especially in the lower leagues, it needs to be better. People say that football's getting boring so we need every bit of excitement that we can get, honestly. So I'm all for documentaries, I think you have just got to keep pushing a good product out on the pitch so the fans enjoy it.”

Regardless of their results this season, co-owners Reynolds and Mac have firmly set their sights on reaching the Premier League. 

Mac has confirmed they are going to continue reaching for the pinnacle of the sport, whether they get there quickly, or gradually. 

He said: ""That's the way the pyramid is set up and why not us? Why should that be reserved for other towns, for other cities?

""It doesn't mean it's going to be easy and it doesn't mean that it's just going to happen quickly. It could take many, many years for it to happen. We're going to make a push to do it as quickly as possible, because we don't know any other way to do it, but we're going to do it the right way.""

He added: ""We're going to do it [reach the Premier League] in the same way that we've been doing it from day one, which is asking the town,"" McElhenney said. ""I sort of jumped the gun early on and just assumed that that's what the people of the town wanted for their club, and that that wasn't necessarily the case.

""I had a lot of very long conversations with people that said, 'Well, we might not be ready for that. The town might not be ready for that and the club might not be ready for that.'

""We have to make sure that we're always checking in with the community to make sure that this is what they want. It was a crazy pipe dream four or five years ago where we got laughed at by the media and by the world, but I don't think anybody's laughing anymore.""

Mac has accepted that Premier League promotion brings with it its own challenges, but he is not giving up. 

He added: ""We don't want to build something that's unsustainable. As glorious as it might be to be promoted to the Premier League, it would be equally as tragic to be relegated again, because that can very quickly create that spiral downwards.

""Is the ultimate goal the Premier League? Yes, of course. Is it winning the Premier League? Yes, of course. But that actually isn't the number one goal. The number one goal is building something for the next generation and leaving something behind that is sustainable for the rest of its existence.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
