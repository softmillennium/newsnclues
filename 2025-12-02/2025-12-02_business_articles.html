                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Tuesday threatened to cut off federal funding to Democratic-leaning states over their alleged refusal to share SNAP program data with the Trump administration. The administration "will begin to stop moving federal funds into those states" starting next week "until they comply," Rollins told President Donald Trump during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. Rollins said her department needs the state-by-state data on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as food stamps, "to root out this fraud and to protect the American taxpayer." The noncompliant states include California, New York and Minnesota, Rollins said. The governors' offices for each state did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. A USDA spokesperson later specified in a statement to CNBC, "28 States and Guam joined us in this fight; but states like California, New York, and Minnesota, among 19 other blue States, keep fighting us." The department had "established a SNAP integrity team" to analyze state data and "end indiscriminate welfare fraud," the spokesperson said. "We have sent Democrat States yet another request for data, and if they fail to comply, they will be provided with formal warning that USDA will pull their administrative funds." — CNBC's Mary Catherine Wellons contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>[The stream is slated to start at 11:30 a.m. Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.] President Donald Trump is holding a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Tuesday, as his administration grapples with a slew of major political issues that have come to the fore since the top officials last convened less than eight weeks earlier. The meeting comes as bipartisan scrutiny ramps up over the administration's decision to fire multiple missile strikes on an alleged Venezuelan drug-running boat in early September. The White House said Monday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authorized Adm. Frank Bradley to order a second strike on the boat, which reportedly killed survivors of the initial attack. Some experts and lawmakers have said the "double-tap" strike could constitute a war crime. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican, vowed on Monday to conduct oversight on the military action. The shutdown, which ended on Nov. 12 after 43 days, centered on a dispute over enhanced Affordable Care Act health-insurance subsidies, which are set to expire by the end of the year. Numerous polls showed more Americans blamed Republicans for the shutdown, which overlapped with a string of blowout victories for Democrats in key elections in early November. The sweeping GOP rout set off alarm bells within Trump's party, which hopes to keep its slim congressional majorities after next year's midterms. The shifting dynamics have drawn focus to Tuesday's special election for a congressional seat in a deep-red Tennessee district, which appears to have grown competitive despite backing Trump by 22 points in 2024. Days after the partisan shutdown fight ended, Congress surprisingly came together to back a bill ordering the Department of Justice to release its files on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He signed it Nov. 19, starting a 30-day timer for Attorney General Pam Bondi to publicly release unclassified files relating to Epstein and his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. Meanwhile, Ukraine's apparent openness to a U.S.-brokered peace plan with Russia is raising hope that an end to the yearslong land war in Europe could be coming into view. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner were seen on Tuesday morning in Moscow, where they were expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon has found a way to let cloud clients extensively customize generative AI models. The Nova Forge offering from Amazon Web Services gives organizations access to Amazon's AI models in various stages of training so they can incorporate their own data earlier in the process. Already, companies can fine-tune large language models after they've been trained. Nova Forge customers will also have the option to refine open-weight models, but training data and computing infrastructure are not included. Organizations that assemble their own models might end up spending hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, which means using Nova Forge is more affordable, Amazon said. AWS released its own models under the Nova brand in 2024, but they aren't the first choice for most software developers. A July survey from Menlo Ventures said that by the middle of this year, Amazon-backed Anthropic controlled 32% of the market for enterprise LLMs, followed by OpenAI with 25%, Google with 20% and Meta with 9% — Amazon Nova had a less than 5% share, a Menlo spokesperson said. "We are a frontier lab that has focused on customers," Rohit Prasad, Amazon head scientist for artificial general intelligence, told CNBC in an interview. We have invented on their behalf to make this happen." Nova Forge is also in use by internal Amazon customers, including teams that work on the company's stores and the Alexa AI assistant, Prasad said. Reddit needed an AI model for moderating content that would be sophisticated about the many subjects people discuss on the social network. Engineers found that a Nova model enhanced with Reddit data through Forge performed better than commercially available large-scale models, Prasad said. Booking.com, Nimbus Therapeutics, the Nomura Research Institute and Sony are also building models with Forge, Amazon said. Organizations can request that Amazon engineers help them build their Forge models, but that assistance is not included in the new service's $100,000 annual fee. AWS is also introducing new models for developers at its Reinvent conference in Las Vegas this week. Nova 2 Pro is a reasoning model whose tests show it performs at least as well as Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5, OpenAI's GPT-5 and GPT-5.1, and Google's Gemini 3.0 Pro Preview, Amazon said. Reasoning involves running a series of computations that might take extra time in response to requests to produce better answers. Nova 2 Pro will be available in early access to AWS customers with Forge subscriptions, Prasad said. That means Forge customers and Amazon engineers will be able to try Nova 2 Pro at the same time. It's the first reasoning model with that range of capability, Amazon said. Amazon hopes that, by delivering a multifaceted model, it can lower the cost and complexity of incorporating AI models into applications. Nova is the second-most popular family of models in Bedrock, Prasad said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon's cloud unit on Tuesday announced AI-enabled software designed to help clients better understand and recover from outages. DevOps Agent, as the artificial intelligence tool from Amazon Web Services is called, predicts the cause of technical hiccups using input from third-party tools such as Datadog and Dynatrace. The AI outage tool from AWS is intended to help companies more quickly figure out what caused an outage and implement fixes, Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of agentic AI at AWS, told CNBC. It's what site reliability engineers, or SREs, do at many companies that provide online services. SREs try to prevent downtime and jump into action during live incidents. Startups such as Resolve and Traversal have started marketing AI assistants for these experts. Microsoft's Azure cloud group introduced an SRE Agent in May. Rather than waiting for on-call staff members to figure out what happened, the AWS DevOps Agent automatically assigns work to agents that look into different hypotheses, Sivasubramanian said. Commonwealth Bank of Australia has tested the AWS DevOps Agent. In under 15 minutes, the software found the root cause of an issue that would have taken a veteran engineer hours, AWS said in a statement. The tool relies on Amazon's in-house AI models and those from other providers, a spokesperson said. AWS has been selling software in addition to raw infrastructure for many years. Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, these cloud infrastructure providers have been trying to demonstrate how generative AI models, which are often training in large cloud computing data centers, can speed up work for software developers. Over the summer, Amazon announced Kiro, a so-called vibe coding tool that produces and modifies source code based on user text prompts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence startup Mistral released a new suite of models Tuesday as it looks to keep pace with leading AI labs Google, OpenAI and DeepSeek. Mistral's release includes a large model which it claims is the "world's best open-weight multimodal and multilingual." It also announced the release of a small model the company says can be used in robotics, devices and drones. Founded in 2023, Mistral has emerged as one of Europe's leading AI companies and raised a 1.7 billion euro funding round in September. Dutch chip equipment maker ASML contributed 1.3 billion euros of the raise, with Nvidia also participating. "Mistral 3 sets a new standard for the global availability of AI and unlocks new possibilities for enterprises," the company said in a statement. "This spectrum of models further extends our customers' applied AI capabilities to robotics, autonomous drones, and small on-device applications without network access, as well as the world's largest enterprise agentic workflows." Mistral's new large model offers powerful agentic capabilities and is engineered for AI assistants, retrieval-augmented systems, scientific workloads and complex enterprise workflows, the company said. The startup's new small model, dubbed Ministral 3, is small enough to run in drones, cars, robots, phones and laptops. "Small models deliver advantages for most real-world applications: lower inference cost, reduced latency, and domain-specific performance," Mistral said. "They can be customized to outperform larger models on specific workflows and reach state-of-the-art performance for their size." Ministral 3 can be deployed on a single graphics processing unit (GPU), which the company said reduced running costs and sped up iteration. "Together, we're building towards an era of distributed intelligence." The latest releases come as Mistral looks to ramp up commercial activity in a bid to justify its nearly 12 billion euro price tag. Alongside a deal with HSBC to give the multinational bank access to its models for tasks ranging from financial analysis to translation, announced on Monday, Mistral has inked contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars with several corporates. The startup is also increasingly looking to M&A as it accelerates growth. While considered a leading homegrown player in the AI space in Europe, Mistral's war chest pales in comparison to a cohort of U.S. rivals that are increasingly setting up shop on the continent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael Burry questioned Tesla's valuation as the investor of "The Big Short" fame took aim at the practice of technology companies issuing tons of stock-based compensation and excluding it from earnings results. "Tesla's market capitalization is ridiculously overvalued today and has been for a good long time," Burry, who rose to fame for his call on a housing market bubble in the 2000s, wrote to subscribers of his new paid Substack. Burry pointed out that Tesla dilutes shareholders at a rate of 3.6% each year and doesn't offer buybacks. He posted a chart with subscribers that he said "shows the kind of present value destruction that this level of dilution can impart." He said the vote to accept CEO Elon Musk's $1 trillion compensation plan means investors should expect to get diluted further — meaning that that these additional shares water down their ownership of the company. The package had 75% approval among voting shares, despite proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS coming out against it. "With recent news of Elon Musk's $1 trillion dollar pay package, dilution is certain to continue," Burry wrote. The electric vehicle maker's shares have added more than 6% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 has surged more than 15% in the same period. Burry noted that moving past dilution "is not easy" for businesses. He also pointed to Palantir and Amazon as other well-known technology companies that dilute their shares through employee-based compensation, a practice that Burry said "penalizes shareholders." The newsletter post goes into an in-depth explanation of how stock-based compensation is not accurately reflected under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and how companies used "adjusted" earnings to present a bottom line that wrongly ignores the practice as a real expense. Burry quotes Warren Buffett's view of stock-based compensation being treated as something other than a tangible expense: "What else could it be — a gift from shareholders?" wrote Buffett in his Berkshire Hathaway 2018 annual letter. Burry launched his Substack called "Cassandra Unchained" late last month after deregistering hedge fund Scion Asset Management. The blog, which has a $379 annual subscription fee, has so far focused on why he believes artificial intelligence is a bubble.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MongoDB shares ripped 25% higher on Tuesday after the company blew past Wall Street's third-quarter expectations and lifted its forecast as its cloud database platform gained traction with customers. The database software provider posted adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share on $628 million in revenue. That topped the 80 cents adjusted per share and $592 million in revenue expected by analysts polled by LSEG. MongoDB said its Atlas platform grew 30% from a year ago and accounted for 75% of total revenues for the quarter. "Q3 was an exceptional quarter that was driven by our continued go-to-market execution and the broad-based demand we are seeing across business," said CEO Chirantan "CJ" Desai in his first earnings call at the helm of the company. Dev Ittycheria, who ran the company for 11 years and took it public, stepped down in November. Desai believes the company is approaching a "once in a lifetime" opportunity as artificial intelligence, cloud and data trends reach a "true inflection point." He told investors he plans to focus on building customer relationships and innovation in the coming months. Citing those tailwinds, MongoDB boosted its guidance for the full year on Atlas growth and tailwinds from ongoing artificial intelligence demand. Analysts at Bernstein lifted their price target on shares to $452, expecting the stock to continue benefiting from accelerating growth as other software companies struggle. "We expect strong consumption demand, potential upside from AI, and benefits from an easing interest rate environment to continue driving re-rating upside in the near term," they wrote. Shares have popped more than 40% this year. WATCH: MongoDB CEO: Still early in AI, our strength is driven by core business Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael and Susan Dell announced Tuesday that they have committed $6.25 billion to fund investment accounts for some 25 million American children. "It's designed to help families feel supported from the start and encourage them to keep saving as their children grow," Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, told CNBC in an interview. "We know that when children have accounts like this, they're much more likely to graduate from high school, from college, buy a home, start a business and less likely to be incarcerated." The Dells' commitment goes hand in hand with a new federal government program that allows parents to open tax-advantaged investment accounts for children under 18 with Social Security numbers. Under the federal program, U.S. citizens born from the beginning of 2025 through 2028 will receive a federal grant of $1,000 to seed those so-called Trump accounts. The Dells have committed to seed Trump accounts with $250 for children who are 10 or under who were born before Jan. 1, 2025. According to Invest America, the pledged funds will cover 25 million children age 10 and under in ZIP codes with a median income of $150,000 or less. Dell said he first became interested in seeding investment accounts for children after hearing the idea from hedge fund manager Brad Gerstner around 2021. Gerstner, CEO of Altimeter Capital, later founded Invest America, which advocated for the program to get included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Trump Accounts can only be used to invest in low-cost diversified funds that track a U.S. stock index. Gerstner said these accounts and grants give American children the chance to benefit from U.S. stock market growth at an early age. However, Gerstner said the seed money encourages parents to add their own funds. He added that the legislation makes it far easier for corporations and philanthropists to make charitable contributions on a large scale. Dell Technologies has pledged to match the $1,000 grants by the U.S. Treasury deposited into accounts for new children of employees. Parents only have to open a Trump account to automatically receive a grant from the Dells. "It would have been impractical, or maybe even impossible, to impact this many kids in this way without such a program," Dell said. There are few precedents for the Dells' pledge. The foundation of shoe billionaire Harold Alfond, who died in 2007, issues $500 educational grants toward every child born in Maine. The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Dell said he has spoken to other major philanthropists and is optimistic that others will also pledge funds to these investment accounts. "What we hope is that every child sees a future worth saving for it," he said. "You think about the compounding effect of a program like this in 10, 20, 30 years on millions of children.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia-backed video generation startup Luma AI is joining a growing wave of U.S. tech companies launching operations in the U.K., with major plans for a London expansion revealed on Tuesday. The Palo Alto-headquartered startup will look to hire around 200 employees — making up around 40% of its workforce — at its new London base by early 2027, across research, engineering, partnerships and strategic development. The expansion comes two weeks on from Luma announcing a $900 million funding round led by Saudi Public Investment Fund-owned AI company Humain, which saw it hit a valuation upwards of $4 billion. The startup previously received backing from Nvidia. Luma is building "world models," a class of AI models that are able to learn from video, audio and images, alongside text, and which large language models (LLMs) like those powering OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini use. The startup is currently targeting marketing, advertising, media and entertainment sectors with its video models, which it sells via an application programming interface (API) and as part of a content creation suite. "With this Series C raise and the upcoming build-out of global compute infrastructure, we have the capital and capacity to bring world-scale AI to creatives everywhere," said Amit Jain, CEO and co-founder of Luma AI. "Launching across Europe and the Middle East is the logical next step in putting this power directly in the hands of storytellers, agencies and brands globally." "London has some of the best people when it comes to research, given the universities here and institutions like DeepMind," he said. Luma is the latest in a wave of North American AI labs doubling down on the U.K. and Europe as they look to take advantage of talent pools and revenue opportunities. Canadian AI startup Cohere said it would open a Paris office to become its EMEA headquarters in September and OpenAI announced a new office in Munich in February. While world models may not yet be as developed as LLMs, some researchers say they are as, if not more, crucial in the pursuit of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). "These kinds of visual models are about a year to a year-and-a-half behind language models right now," said Jain. But world models will become the "natural interface" for AI for most day-to-day use in time, he predicted, pointing to the amount of time people spend watching video content each day. Tech giants including Google, Meta and Nvidia are all developing world models for a range of use cases. Luma released its latest model, Ray3, in September, which Jain told CNBC benchmarks higher than OpenAI's Sora and at similar levels to Google's Veo 3.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amina Green, a 29-year-old data scientist based in San Francisco. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. I remember being excited for my first Waymo ride earlier last year. It's a personal choice for me not to get my driver's license, so I walk most places in San Francisco or use ride-hailing. I've known about autonomous-driving technology for a while. I've been living in SF for about five years. So it was exciting just to even step inside a Waymo for the first time. I even made a video of myself doing my makeup inside the robotaxi, and it got a lot of views on social media. There's the novelty of it to some extent. But it's also like having my own energy or vibe in the car; I can set the music to what I like, I can control the temperature — those sorts of things. Then, in September 2024, I was involved in an incident inside a Waymo that left me a little scared and frustrated. Then, near the South of Market-Tenderloin area, these two guys stepped right in front of my ride after the Waymo stopped for a red light. I don't know why they did that. I repeatedly told them to get out of the way, to stop, and that they were holding up traffic. 🚨Warning to women in SF 🚨I love Waymo but this was scary 😣2 men stopped in front of my car and demanded that I give my number.It left me stuck as the car was stalled in the street.Thankfully, it only lasted a few minutes...Ladies please be aware of this pic.twitter.com/6VEqb1WoJb But I was also a bit afraid. I used to work for a nonprofit in this neighborhood, so I knew that if something happened, there wouldn't be police nearby or anyone to really help. It was a little scary, but also kind of annoying. Other drivers on the road were getting upset, and I felt like a sitting duck. I don't remember if I called Waymo's remote assistance or if they contacted me, but the support team determined that something had happened during my ride. Throughout the day, they called me two more times to make sure I was OK. It was interesting to see the features they're working on. After the incident, I stopped taking Waymo for maybe about two or three months. I've been using ride-hailing services for nearly 10 years. There are situations where I wouldn't have wanted to be alone in a car with a stranger at night. Sometimes, the ride is just straight-up dangerous. I recall a driver who was distracted by his phone, watching YouTube videos while driving. I feel safer knowing that Waymo has personnel on standby in case something happens to its cars. That's not to say Waymo is perfect. For example, people interact with the streets differently in different neighborhoods. Is Waymo thinking about the kinds of environments its cars go through? It may not be politically correct to say, but I think this is just the basic reality of the world we live in: There are certain neighborhoods where women, or any person, might be more likely targeted if you're by yourself. To them, Waymo is a symbol of this larger cultural change in the region that they feel like they're being left out of. So, while I don't agree with it, I almost understand why some people would vandalize the cars. I still use human ride-hailing services — I'd say it's about 50-50 — because Waymo's wait time can be a bit long. Or sometimes Waymo's just way more expensive. I hope this will be widely available, but there are some considerations and edge cases that may need to be addressed before mass adoption.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It also means hundreds of millions of people have been using ChatGPT for years and … not seeing any ads at all, whether they're using the paid version or the free one. That's not totally astonishing: We've gotten used to consumer internet products like Google, Facebook, and Instagram taking off without ads for a few years. Over the weekend, we got a hint that an ad push may be underway, via some code from ChatGPT's Android app unearthed by developer Tibor Blaho: Scouring apps for yet-to-be-released features is a long-standing tech hobby, and sometimes it really does yield results. It's also entirely possible that what Blaho found is … something other than an ad product road map. We know this in part because OpenAI executives, starting with Sam Altman, have suggested they will be coming (in 2024, Altman said ads were gross; this year, he allowed that maybe OpenAI could make "some cool ad product"). We know it because OpenAI has been stocking itself with talent from Meta — one of the most successful advertising companies in the world. We know it because it's simply logical: Altman says ChatGPT has around 800 million weekly users, and only a small percentage of them pay. At some point, his company will want to convert those non-paying users into revenue-generating ones, and ads are the obvious way to do that. And we know it because on Monday, via an internal memo, OpenAI acknowledged that it was working on ads — but was now delaying that push, while it scrambled to improve its core product in the face of competition from Google. (I've asked OpenAI for comment; while we're here, I'll note that OpenAI has a business partnership with Axel Springer, which owns Business Insider.) Meanwhile, The Information reports, OpenAI focus groups show that some ChatGPT users already assume ads play a role in the results they're seeing. But none of that tells us when ads will actually arrive in ChatGPT. And it certainly doesn't address the core question about what happens when you inject ads into an answer machine: Does that machine give you the best answers? Which brings us to the next question: If ads do show up, what would they look like? Because sticking ads into an AI assistant isn't like putting them next to search results or inside a news feed. This is the Google model: You tell Google exactly what you're looking for — "dumpling spot near me," "best Chromebook" — and advertisers bid to appear next to those queries. You are probably typing things into ChatGPT and reading its results. But it doesn't have to work like that: ChatGPT can already talk and show you images. All of which means that Altman and Co. may have a choice to serve you ads that aren't tiny boxes of text on your phone. But no matter what route OpenAI takes, all of its ad plans will have the same peril: the possibility that injecting paid messages in a service you count on could change your relationship with that service, and weaken that trust. They might move more slowly on this one than some people think.</p>

Early-stage drone startups are suddenly winning contracts once typically reserved for more established defense companies, a frenzy that has turned 2025 into a breakout year for drones across both defense and commercial markets. Defense-focused drone startups are motivated to work on the tech and "make sure the West wins in the emerging era of unmanned wars," Ethan Thornton, CEO and founder of Mach Industries, said in an email to Business Insider. His startup recently won a US Army contract for its cruise missiles. Figures on the number of employees and the amount of funding each company has raised are based on data provided by PitchBook, unless otherwise specified. Here's a list of the startups trying to define how drone tech is being built, deployed, and used by governments and commercial customers alike: Founders include: Palmer Luckey, Brian Schimpf, Trae Stephens, Matt Grimm, Joseph Chen Key investors: Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, 8VC, Lux Capital, Valor Equity Partners, Elad Gil What it does: Founded in 2017 after Palmer Luckey was ousted from Facebook, now Meta Platforms, Anduril makes a suite of autonomous products and AI systems for militaries. Key investors: New Enterprise Associates, Washington Harbour Partners, Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin, Craft Ventures What it does: Firestorm's flagship product, xCell, is a micro-factory that can quickly produce drone replacement parts and small aerial vehicles that can be configured for specific uses. What it does: Headquartered in Munich, Helsing makes AI battlefield software. Helsing's latest fundraise, a $695 million round in June led by Prima Materia, a fund founded by Spotify chairman and CEO Daniel Ek, makes the company one of the more well-financed European startups. The company also makes a strike drone, called HX-2, and Ca-1 Europa, an uncrewed fighter jet. And it's moving into the maritime space as well: In October, Helsing acquired Blue Ocean, a marine technology company specializing in autonomous underwater vehicles. What it does: Like many of its competitors, Mach Industries is banking on the future of warfare, prioritizing mass-produced, cheap, smaller drones over prime contractors' multimillion-dollar fighter jets. It's also working on Glide, a high-altitude glider that can deliver munitions to locations thousands of miles away. "Mach takes a deeply vertically integrated, hardware first approach to defense, rapidly iterating and mass manufacturing our products to make sure the West wins in the emerging era of unmanned wars," Ethan Thornton, CEO and Founder of Mach Industries said in an email. What it does: Neros makes drones and ground control stations. Earlier this year, Neros also received a $17 million contract from the Marine Corps for roughly 8,000 FPV drones. Cofounder Soren Monroe-Anderson told Business Insider in an email that the company is building "a secure, China-free supply chain." Its Trinity Pro is an electric VTOL drone used for mapping terrain. Key investors: Andreessen Horowitz, United States Innovative Technology, L3 Harris Technologies USIT The company also develops Hivemind, an AI software tool to manage uncrewed aerial systems. Founded in 2014, the company makes autonomous drones for government and commercial use. Founders include: Alex Pachikov, Chris Eheim, Nick de Palézieux What it does: Sunflower Labs develops an autonomous security drone system called Beehive, a network of drones that the company says can surveil large commercial properties — such as data centers, warehouses, and other industrial sites — potentially deterring and capturing security footage of theft and vandalism. In 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized Zipline to deliver commercial goods beyond the visual line of sight — meaning outside an operator's direct line of sight — around Salt Lake City.</p>
