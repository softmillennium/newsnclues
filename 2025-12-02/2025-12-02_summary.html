About 7,000 workers have already been cut from the agency, leading to understaffed field offices and overwhelmed phones.

The Trump administration is reportedly looking to dramatically reduce the number of people who visit Social Security field offices across the United States, a plan that Democratic lawmakers warned is yet another scheme to disrupt and ultimately cut benefits.

Nextgov/FCW viewed internal Social Security Administration (SSA) planning documents showing that the agency is aiming for “no more than 15 million total” in-person visits to field offices in fiscal year 2026 — half the level of the prior fiscal year.

“Under Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano, the agency is aiming to push people to interact with Social Security online instead of going to a field office or calling the agency, although Bisignano told lawmakers in June that, even with his focus on technology, the agency is not ‘getting rid of field offices,' despite reports of planned closures,” Nextgov/FCW reported Monday.

One anonymous SSA staffer told the outlet that agency leadership wants “fewer people in the front door and they want all work that doesn't require direct customer interactions to be centralized.”

“They appear to be quietly killing field offices,” the staffer said.

The plan comes after the Trump administration carried out the largest staffing cut in SSA history, cutting the agency's workforce by around 7,000. The cut left one SSA worker for every 1,480 beneficiaries, resulting in understaffed field offices and overwhelmed phone operations.

Beneficiaries have also repeatedly faced issues this year attempting to access the Social Security website, problems that SSA's plan to curb field office visits could exacerbate.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), one of the lawmakers spearheading a probe into Bisignano's questionable tenure at the fintech company Fiserv, said in response to the new reporting that “this sure sounds like another way to make it even harder for Americans to get the benefits they've earned.”

In a social media post on Monday, Warren highlighted testimony from seniors who have faced long wait times and other difficulties while seeking assistance from SSA under Bisignano's leadership:

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, told Nextgov/FCW that “between staffing reductions, more restrictive documentation requirements for Americans to get assistance on the phones, and rapid reorganization of offices around the country, it's difficult to see how” SSA's goal of slashing visits to field offices “will lead to anything other than worse service and more challenges at Social Security.”

Defense secretary has been insisting that an admiral gave the order for the second strike on alleged drug boat back in September

Trump administration is ‘selling out' admiral to shield Hegseth over boat strikes, officials say

Pete Hegseth told US soldiers in Iraq to ignore legal advice on rules of engagement

“We always have the backs of our commanders,” Hegseth said, insisting that “they've done the right things” in making judgement calls in difficult situations.

He's alluding to Admiral Frank M Bradley, the military commander whom Hegseth has been insisting since yesterday gave the order for the second strike on the alleged drug boat on 2 September. The White House has also been backing this narrative, leading some some officials in Congress and the Pentagon, as well as Democrats, to now fear that Bradley is being made a scapegoat for the potentially illegal order.

Transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, reiterated his call for passengers to “bring their better selves” when flying in an effort to “bring civility back to travel”.

“If you have a someone's pregnant on your flight and you're as strong as Pete is,” Duffy said, looking and joking with the defense secretary during Trump's cabinet meeting. “Well pick up the bag and help her, put it in the overhead bin. Let's be nice to each other.”

The secretary reiterated his calls for passengers to “maybe not wear pajamas or slippers on the airplane”.

“We always have the backs of our commanders,” Hegseth said, insisting that “they've done the right things” in making judgement calls in difficult situations.

He's alluding to Admiral Frank M Bradley, the military commander whom Hegseth has been insisting since yesterday gave the order for the second strike on the alleged drug boat on 2 September. The White House has also been backing this narrative, leading some some officials in Congress and the Pentagon, as well as Democrats, to now fear that Bradley is being made a scapegoat for the potentially illegal order.

In his first public outing since the Washington Post reported that he ordered a second strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat that killed two shipwrecked survivors, Pete Hegseth doubled down on strikes on boats in the Caribbean:

We've only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean, because they've been poisoning the American people.

“We're going to New Orleans soon” with the national guard, Trump said, adding that the Republican governor (and staunch ally of the president) of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, had called him and asked for help.

“We're going there in a couple of weeks,” Trump said.

Trump told the cabinet meeting that he would be announcing his selection for the next chair of the Federal Reserve early next year.

He added that he talked to treasury secretary Scott Bessent about taking over the Fed but Bessent didn't want the job.

Donald Trump's cabinet meeting started a short while ago a little behind schedule. I'll bring you all the key lines here.

Also earlier, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called Hegseth “spineless” and “a national embarrassment” and called for the defense secretary to release the full unedited tape of the deadly strikes on the alleged drug boat off the coast of Venezuela on 2 September.

Schumer pointed to a recent appearance on Fox News where Hegseth “bragged that he was present at every moment of the operation” but is now claiming Admiral Bradley made the decision about the second strike.

“The minute trouble arises, Hegseth says someone else was making the decision,” Schumer said.

As well as releasing the tape, Schumer said the defense secretary must testify publicly on the matter, as well as briefing the Senate in a classified setting.

Meanwhile, at the Democrats press conference earlier, representative Ted Lieu of California called on Pete Hegseth to resign, saying the defense secretary lied about the second strike on the suspected drug-smuggling boat and “and threw Admiral Bradley under the bus”.

“Killing shipwreck survivors is a war crime,” said Lieu, a former lawyer with the US Air Force Judge Advocate General's Corps. He said there was no statute of limitation on war crimes and the justice department should conduct an investigation and hold everyone accountable.

Hegseth “engaged in dishonorable conduct”, Lieu said, adding: “He is a coward, he must resign, you deserve better.”

Fellow California representative Pete Aguilar reiterated that they feel Hegseth should resign but added that Republicans would never go with impeachment.

“Members of the military need to tell the truth,” he said. “We need a full accounting of what happened on that day with that strike”.

Wilson said today that Pentagon can “100% confirm that we know, without a shadow of a doubt, who these Narco terrorists are”.

While Wilson said the department knows what these suspected carters are “carrying, where they're coming from and where they're going,” she declined to provide details about the Pentagon's intelligence efforts. “I don't want to communicate to the enemy, the ways in which we're carrying out these strikes,” she added.

At a briefing today, Department of Defense press secretary Kingsley Wilson said that the “decision to re-strike the narco terrorist vessel was made by Adm Bradley”. 

Wilson added that Bradley was operating under “clear and longstanding authorities to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States was eliminated”.

She re-affirmed that defense secretary Pete Hegseth stands behind Bradley. “Adm Bradley made the right call, and unlike the previous administration, we have our war fighters back at this department,” Wilson said.

While answering questions from reporters today, Mike Johnson said he doesn't know how much of the video recording of the second strike on alleged drug-trafficking boat, which reportedly killed two survivors, should be released.

“I'm not sure how much is sensitive with regard to national security,” he said. “I haven't had a chance to review it, so I'm not going to prejudge it.”

Johnson reiterated that US Navy admiral Frank Bradley made the decision to launch the second strike. “He's a highly decorated, highly respected admiral in the Navy, and he made that call, and so, you know, we're going to have to look at that,” Johnson said.

House speaker Mike Johnson quickly plugged the Matt Van Epps, the Republican candidate in the special election for Tennessee's seventh congressional district.

Ballots are being cast today, in a race that's become more competitive in a seat that's been a conservative stronghold in elections past. A reminder, Trump won the district by 22 points in 2024.

“He's a combat veteran. He flew combat missions, deployed eight times over to the Middle East and dodge missiles and bullets for his country. He worked in Tennessee State Government, and is a highly capable, competent, calm, common sense conservative,” Johnson said of Van Epps.

A recent poll from Emerson College and the Hill had Van Epps leading his Democratic challenger, Aftyn Behn, by just two points.

Today, Johnson reiterated that “anything can happen” in a special election.

“When you're in a deep red district, sometimes people assume that the Republican, the conservative, will win. You cannot assume that,” Johnson said.

House Republicans are now holding a press conference on Capitol Hill. I'll bring you the key lines here. We're particularly keen to hear how GOP lawmakers respond to the ongoing scrutiny facing the Pentagon, after reports that the defense secretary ordered officials to kill the survivors of an initial strike on a suspected drug-trafficking boat.

Following on from my last post, my colleague Maanvi Singh has been reporting on how asylum seekers in the US are contending with the move from the Trump administration to pause asylum decisions indefinitely.

She notes that the new rules could affect nearly 1.5m pending asylum cases with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

Legal experts expect that the broader asylum pause and other policy changes will face challenges in court. Advocates have warned that the administration's policy announcements targeting refugees, asylum seekers and specifically Afghan nationals, after last week's shooting, amount to collective punishment.

Read Maanvi's full report below:

The Department of Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem, has called for a sweeping and vague “full travel ban” on “every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies”.

Following last week's shooting in Washington DC, that killed one member of the West Virginia national guard, and left another critically wounded, the Trump administration paused all asylum decisions. The suspect is a 29-year-old Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who entered the country through a Biden-era resettlement program after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. His asylum claim was ultimately approved after Trump returned to office.

The White House has, however, blamed the previous administration for the “original sin” that allowed Lakanwal to move to the US in the first place.

In a Monday post on X, Noem said that she had spoken with the president, but was not clear about which countries should be included in a travel ban.

“Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom,” she wrote. “Not for foreign invaders to slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to AMERICANS. WE DON'T WANT THEM. NOT ONE.”

Donald Trump has accused officials in Honduras of “trying to change” the result of the country's presidential election, as the release of vote counts was paused with two rightwing candidates locked in a technical tie.

The virtual vote count had been slow and unstable before it was interrupted around midday on Monday. The electoral court said a technical problem was to blame and insisted the manual count was continuing.

On his social network, Trump accused officials of “trying to change the results” and warned that “if they do, there will be hell to pay!”.

It was the latest in a string of dramatic interventions by the US president. Before the vote, Trump had thrown his support behind Nasry “Tito” Asfura – who on Monday was ahead of his rival, Salvador Nasralla, by just 515 votes – saying that US support for the country was conditional on an Asfura victory.

He also made the extraordinary pledge to pardon Asfura's ally, the former president Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking in a New York court last year and sentenced to 45 years in prison for allegedly creating “a cocaine superhighway to the United States”.

As election officials pleaded for patience on Tuesday, Hernández's wife, Ana García de Hernández, disclosed that the former president had been released from a US prison.

Today, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to meet with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. He'll be joined by the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

The meeting comes after a US delegation – which included secretary of state Marco Rubio – held “productive” talks with Ukrainian negotiators in Florida over the weekend. On Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration “feels very optimistic” about the prospect of peace.

My colleague, Jakub Krupa, is covering the latest, including Volodymyr Zelenskyy's trip to Dublin, where the Ukrainian leader is holding a press conference with Ireland's prime minister Micheál Martin. 

Today, Zelenskyy said “now, more than ever, there is a chance to end this war”. He added that the latest peace plan draft has 20 points, that have been worked on in Geneva and Florida.

But “some things still need to be worked out,” he said.

Follow along here:

Per my last post, it's worth noting that Michael Dell, the billionaire founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, and his wife, Susan, will donate $6.25bn dollars to the “Trump accounts” scheme, resulting in $250 deposits for roughly 25 million American children.

This contribution is designed to help children 10 or younger, who were born before 2025. It will be available for families who live in zip codes where the median household income is $150,000 or less.

“We know that when children have accounts like this, they're much more likely to graduate from high school, from college, buy a home, start a business and less likely to be incarcerated,” Dell told CNBC in an interview.

Donald Trump is in Washington today, and due to hold his ninth cabinet meeting, since returning to the White House this year.

That's due to start at 11:30am ET, and we'll bring you the latest updates.

Then, the president will make an announcement at 2pm ET, which – according to press secretary Karoline Leavitt – will be about the so-called “Trump accounts”.

A reminder that these are tax-free investment accounts for children under the age of 18 in the US who have a social security number.

The administration has promised a $1,000 seed contribution for those born between 2025 and 2028, whose parents open an account.

US defense secretary posted meme depicting beloved children's character aiming rocket launcher at set of boats

Pete Hegseth told US soldiers in Iraq to ignore legal advice on rules of engagement

A post on social media by US defense secretary Pete Hegseth, depicting a beloved children's character aiming a rocket launcher at a cluster of boats, has elicited condemnation from the book's Canadian publisher.

Hegseth's post of the mocked cover of a Franklin the Turtle book titled Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists prompted disbelief and outrage. The image shows a smiling anthropomorphic turtle in military helmet and vest, with a US flag on his arm and a drug-laden boat exploding in the background. “For your Christmas wish list,” Hegseth wrote as the caption.

Hegseth's post came amid growing outrage over a string of deadly US strikes on boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific, which have killed at least 80 people.

The extrajudicial killings received fresh attention last week after Hegseth was reported to have commanded military personnel to “kill everybody” on board vessels after two survivors were spotted after a 2 September strike. The survivors were killed during a second strike.

Hegseth's post, which seemingly mocks a practice that experts have condemned as illegal, was met with frustration by the publisher of Canadian children's book series over his “unauthorized” depictions of its main character.

“Franklin the Turtle is a beloved Canadian icon who has inspired generations of children and stands for kindness, empathy, and inclusivity,” the publisher Kids Can Press wrote in a statement on X.

“We strongly condemn any denigrating, violent, or unauthorized use of Franklin's name or image, which directly contradicts these values,” the publishing house added.

But Hegseth's post also spawned a series of other mock covers, including one that questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election. Others were more critical of the defense secretary, including one post that said: “Book two is Franklin Goes to the Hague.”

With more than 50 titles and 20m copies sold, the Canadian series has eschewed politics, instead pursuing gentle, moral lessons nestled within stories for children – including Franklin Says Sorry, Franklin Forgives and Franklin is Lost.

A television adaptation featured a theme song by Canadian folk singer Bruce Cockburn, whose first explicitly political song If I Had a Rocket Launcher was written after visiting Guatemalan refugee camps during a civil war in which US-backed forces commited a genocide on the country's Indigenous people.

The Pentagon's law of war manual says that people who are “wounded, sick, or shipwrecked” should be “respected and protected in all circumstances” by US forces- and that “making them the object of attack is strictly prohibited”. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats were “conducted in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict”.

Auditor-General Shelley Spence following the release of her annual report at the Ontario legislature in Toronto on Tuesday.Sammy Kogan/The Canadian Press

Ontario's Auditor-General says the province isn't auditing doctors whose billings raise obvious red flags, including 82 doctors who claimed to have worked 24 hours or more in a single day, a diagnostic radiologist who billed for an average of 461 patients a day, and an ophthalmologist who billed $6.7-million in one year, more than twice as much as the next highest biller in the specialty.

The same unnamed ophthalmologist has been investigated three times for allegedly charging patients out-of-pocket fees for services that should be free through the Ontario Health Insurance Plan. The first review found the doctor wrongly charged patients, a second cleared the ophthalmologist, and a third is ongoing.

When the Ontario Ministry of Health does identify inappropriate billings, it often negotiates settlements that allow doctors to repay less than what they overbilled, Ontario Auditor-General Shelley Spence found in her annual report, released Tuesday.

“Not recovering overpayments from physicians represents a waste of taxpayer's money,” the report said. “Stronger payment recovery mechanisms would enable the Ministry to use taxpayer funds more effectively and efficiently, including the possibility of directing those recovered funds to providing more patient care.” 

Ontario has more family doctors, but fewer are working in primary care, study shows

The Auditor-General noted there hasn't been much improvement in the oversight of physician billings since her office last flagged the problem in a 2016 audit. 

In response, the Ministry of Health approved 22 additional positions for that purpose, but, according to the new report, “the Ministry permanently reallocated 17 to other areas and assigned the remaining five to areas outside of the audit function.” 

Health care was a major focus of Ms. Spence's annual report. Along with scrutinizing physician billings, she also investigated the Progressive Conservative government's oversight of primary care and of medical education in family medicine. 

Ontario Premier Doug Ford has vowed that every Ontarian will be attached to a primary-care physician or nurse practitioner by 2029. Last year he appointed former federal health minister Jane Philpott to lead a Primary Care Action Team to enact that promise. 

The Auditor-General's report, citing a network of primary-care researchers called INSPIRE-PHC, says that about two million Ontarians didn't have a family doctor as of March, 2024, up from 1.8 million in 2020. 

Opinion: Allowing doctors to practise in both public and private systems solves what exactly?

The report identifies several barriers to finding doctors for many patients. It concludes that the province's Health Care Connect service, which is supposed to match patients in need with available doctors, has in recent years left patients languishing in the queue for too long. 

Of the approximately 178,000 people who registered with Health Care Connect between 2020-2021 and 2024-2025 and who were still waiting to be referred to a physician as of June, more than 108,000 had been waiting for more than a year. 

The Auditor-General also found that only 7 per cent of family doctors working in a payment model that sees them formally enroll patients were willing to take patients off the Health Care Connect waiting list. 

Dr. Philpott and her team have in the past year made a concerted effort to tackle the Health Care Connect waiting list, Ontario Health Minister Sylvia Jones has said. In October, her office reported that the Primary Care Action Team was halfway to its goal of clearing the approximately 235,000 names that were on the provincial waiting list as of Jan. 1, 2025 by next spring. 

In a separate audit, the Auditor-General scrutinized the Ford government's plan to expand medical school seats for future family doctors, including by opening two new medical schools at Toronto Metropolitan and York universities. 

Ontario to expand funding for primary health-care teams based on initial success

Ms. Spence and her team concluded the government failed to heed warnings from the leaders of existing medical schools that there were not enough family medicine clinics in the province with the capacity to teach medical residents. For that reason, by the end of this academic year, the Ministry of Health will have rolled out 44 per cent fewer family medicine seats than originally planned, according to the report. 

As part of the physician billing audit, Ms. Spence and her office also looked at how often doctors inappropriately charge patients fees for services that are supposed to be covered by OHIP.

The Ministry of Health has conducted 452 reviews since 2020 under a law called the Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act, 83 per cent of which were related to alleged patient billing violations. About a third of those were for eye procedures, including cataract surgeries. 

“We previously raised this issue in our 2021 audit of Outpatient Surgeries, which found no provincial oversight to protect patients against inappropriate charges for OHIP-funded services or physicians that may mislead and charge patients for unnecessary add-ons,” the new report says. 

The Ontario government has trumpeted its plans to offer more procedures, including cataract surgeries and, eventually, hip and knee surgeries, in private clinics as a way to reduce waiting times.

Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares.  Help us reach 25,000 members by the end of 2025.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Dec. 2 that Moscow is prepared for a war with Europe "right now" if European states initiate one, delivering the remarks moments before meeting U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.

"If Europe starts a war, we are ready right now," the Russian president said.

Putin's comments came as Washington intensifies diplomatic outreach aimed at advancing negotiations to end Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. 

The Russian president claimed that European governments obstruct U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to reach a settlement and "live under illusions" of imposing a strategic defeat on Russia.

Putin also said Europe "has no peaceful agenda" and "is on the side of war," citing military support for Ukraine and the crafting of peace proposals less favorable to Russia as evidence of hostility.

"When they supposedly try to make changes to Trump's proposals… all these changes are aimed at only one thing: to completely block the entire peace process," the Russian president added.

The remarks echoed Moscow's broader messaging as Russia expands hybrid pressure on Europe.

European states have recorded a surge of suspected Russian-linked activities in recent years, including cyberattacks, sabotage attempts, and repeated damage to underwater infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.  

The incidents intensified in early autumn as unidentified drones and Russian aircraft repeatedly crossed into or approached NATO airspace.

In September, Polish forces shot down several Russian drones that entered Polish territory. Days later, a Russian drone breached Romanian airspace, though Bucharest did not engage. 

On Sept. 19, three Russian MiG-31 fighters crossed into Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes, prompting Tallinn to activate consultations under NATO's Article 4.

Belgium also reported a series of drone incidents near critical infrastructure. Belgian authorities said three drones flew over the Doel Nuclear Power Plant on Nov. 9, while several unidentified drones were spotted near sensitive sites in the days that followed.

Putin's latest warning added pressure to European capitals already concerned about Russia's increasing willingness to test air defenses and target infrastructure across the continent.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Witkoff will present Putin with the latest version of the U.S.-Ukraine framework drafted during recent rounds of talks in Geneva and Florida.



Russian President Vladimir Putin said Europe "has no peaceful agenda" and "is on the side of war" just before meeting U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.





A Russian oil tanker reportedly came under a drone attack in the Black Sea while en route to a port in northern Turkey on Dec. 2, according to Turkish authorities. 

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained British citizen Ross David Cutmore, who came to Ukraine as a military instructor, on suspicion of working for Russian intelligence, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 2.

"Ukraine approaches all diplomatic efforts with utmost seriousness – we are committed to achieving a real peace and guaranteed security," Zelensky said.

According to Ukraine's national "Children of War" database, at least 19,546 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and taken to Russia or Russian-controlled areas since February 2022.

"All of this is done exclusively for Western audiences and to raise the stakes in diplomacy," said Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation. 

The latest incident occurred on Nov. 30, when Vilnius International Airport suspended operations after unidentified objects — believed to be balloons — appeared in nearby airspace. 

Russian forces captured about 505 square kilometers (195 square miles) of Ukrainian territory in November, almost twice the gains recorded in September, DeepState said in an assessment Dec. 1. 

"The informational 'victories' that the Russian Defense Ministry  announces daily on paper have nothing to do with the real situation on the front lines," Ukraine's 11th Army Corps said. 

A Ukrainian deep-strike unit hit a Russian "storage and launch area" for Shahed-type drones near Cape Chauda, Crimea, overnight on Nov. 28, the Special Operations Forces said.

Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares.  Help us reach 25,000 members by the end of 2025.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Dec. 2 that Moscow is prepared for a war with Europe "right now" if European states initiate one, delivering the remarks moments before meeting U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.

"If Europe starts a war, we are ready right now," the Russian president said.

Putin's comments came as Washington intensifies diplomatic outreach aimed at advancing negotiations to end Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. 

The Russian president claimed that European governments obstruct U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to reach a settlement and "live under illusions" of imposing a strategic defeat on Russia.

Putin also said Europe "has no peaceful agenda" and "is on the side of war," citing military support for Ukraine and the crafting of peace proposals less favorable to Russia as evidence of hostility.

"When they supposedly try to make changes to Trump's proposals… all these changes are aimed at only one thing: to completely block the entire peace process," the Russian president added.

The remarks echoed Moscow's broader messaging as Russia expands hybrid pressure on Europe.

European states have recorded a surge of suspected Russian-linked activities in recent years, including cyberattacks, sabotage attempts, and repeated damage to underwater infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.  

The incidents intensified in early autumn as unidentified drones and Russian aircraft repeatedly crossed into or approached NATO airspace.

In September, Polish forces shot down several Russian drones that entered Polish territory. Days later, a Russian drone breached Romanian airspace, though Bucharest did not engage. 

On Sept. 19, three Russian MiG-31 fighters crossed into Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes, prompting Tallinn to activate consultations under NATO's Article 4.

Belgium also reported a series of drone incidents near critical infrastructure. Belgian authorities said three drones flew over the Doel Nuclear Power Plant on Nov. 9, while several unidentified drones were spotted near sensitive sites in the days that followed.

Putin's latest warning added pressure to European capitals already concerned about Russia's increasing willingness to test air defenses and target infrastructure across the continent.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained British citizen Ross David Cutmore, who came to Ukraine as a military instructor, on suspicion of working for Russian intelligence, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 2.



Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Witkoff will present Putin with the latest version of the U.S.-Ukraine framework drafted during recent rounds of talks in Geneva and Florida.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Europe "has no peaceful agenda" and "is on the side of war" just before meeting U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.





A Russian oil tanker reportedly came under a drone attack in the Black Sea while en route to a port in northern Turkey on Dec. 2, according to Turkish authorities. 

"Ukraine approaches all diplomatic efforts with utmost seriousness – we are committed to achieving a real peace and guaranteed security," Zelensky said.

According to Ukraine's national "Children of War" database, at least 19,546 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and taken to Russia or Russian-controlled areas since February 2022.

"All of this is done exclusively for Western audiences and to raise the stakes in diplomacy," said Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation. 

The latest incident occurred on Nov. 30, when Vilnius International Airport suspended operations after unidentified objects — believed to be balloons — appeared in nearby airspace. 

Russian forces captured about 505 square kilometers (195 square miles) of Ukrainian territory in November, almost twice the gains recorded in September, DeepState said in an assessment Dec. 1. 

"The informational 'victories' that the Russian Defense Ministry  announces daily on paper have nothing to do with the real situation on the front lines," Ukraine's 11th Army Corps said. 

A Ukrainian deep-strike unit hit a Russian "storage and launch area" for Shahed-type drones near Cape Chauda, Crimea, overnight on Nov. 28, the Special Operations Forces said.

            Dressed head to toe in army fatigues, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday received the news he had been awaiting for more than a year: Russia had taken over the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk.
    


            It doesn't matter that Kyiv disputed the claim, saying on Tuesday that fighting was still going on inside the city and that Moscow's “bravura statements” about the capture of Pokrovsk “do not match the reality.”
    


            The point of the highly choreographed meeting between Putin and his top military brass was to show the world that Russia is winning in Ukraine.
    


            The Kremlin said Putin was informed of the victory during a visit to a “command post” on Sunday, although both were only publicized late on Monday, on the eve of the Russian leader's meeting with key aides to US President Donald Trump.
    


Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, accompanied by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, was set to meet Putin later on Tuesday – the latest instalment of a diplomatic whirlwind by the US aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.
    


            Putin has indicated he has no interest in finding compromises. He reiterated his maximalist demands that Ukraine limits the size of its army, gives up some of its territory, and is banned from joining NATO.
    


            The proposal Witkoff is bringing to Putin has not been made public, but Ukraine has made it clear it cannot accept any peace plan that would encroach on its sovereignty along the lines of Moscow's demands.
    


            Putin's visit to the military post on Sunday, just before his meeting with the Americans, was clearly designed to portray Putin as a strong war-time leader who has the upper hand in Ukraine.
    


            Unlike Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who travels to the frontlines to meet soldiers on fairly regular basis, the Russian leader tends to keep his distance from the war.
    


            His interactions with the military are rare but carefully timed – such as when he traveled to Kursk in March, just days before one of his previous meetings with Witkoff in Moscow.
    


            Speaking to his top generals on Sunday, Putin praised them for “liberating” Pokrovsk, which he called by its Soviet-era name of Krasnoarmiisk, which translates as “Red Army City.”
    


Trump envoy to meet with Putin as US pushes to end war in Ukraine



            Kremlin made a point of the Pokrovsk developments on Monday, publishing a video showing Russian soldiers unfurling a Russian flag in Pokrovsk's city center – even though that particular area has been under Moscow's control for some time.
    


            The strategic value of Pokrovsk, which served as a Ukrainian supply hub earlier in the war, has been greatly diminished during the many months of heavy fighting. But its seizure would nevertheless represent the biggest win for Moscow since 2023.
    


            Ukrainian troops on the ground in Pokrovsk told CNN that the situation was extremely difficult.
    


            One Ukrainian commander with a unit fighting in the city said that Russian troops had “nowhere near complete control” of Pokrovsk and that his unit was still holding onto their positions inside the city. However, another soldier said that it was “mostly true” that Russia was in control.
    


            CNN cannot publish the soldiers' name due to security restrictions.
    


            This declarations around Pokrovsk echoed the bold statements Russia made about “piercing” the Ukrainian frontline back in August, just days before the meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska.
    


            Speaking at the command post on Sunday, Putin stressed that the Russian military was “advancing at a pace that guarantees the completion of all our objectives.” He doubled down on the claim he made last week, when he threatened Kyiv that if it doesn't agree to give up some of its territories, including the rest of the Donetsk region, willingly in the negotiations, Russia will take them by force.
    


            George Barros, who leads the Russia and Geospatial Intelligence teams at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, said the messaging by Putin is aimed at Ukraine's western allies as much as it is at Ukraine.
    


            “If he can successfully convince the world that Russia's battlefield victory is inevitable, then that leads to the question (among Kyiv's allies) ‘Why are we supporting Ukraine? Let's just negotiate now,'” Barros told CNN last month.
    


            But while Russia is inching forward along the frontlines in eastern Ukraine, its overall victory is not at all certain, Barros said. The latest ISW assessment of the Russian forces' rate of advance indicates that a Russian military victory in Ukraine is “not inevitable” and that a quick Russian military takeover of the rest of the Donetsk region – which Putin has been threatening – is unlikely.
    


            So even though Putin and his military commanders continue to tout Russian advances and peddle the narrative of their inevitable victory, the easiest way for Russia to get what it wants is either by coercing Ukraine into taking a bad deal, or by convincing Kyiv's allies to ease out their support.
    


            The US would be key for either of the two options.

MOSCOW, December 2. /TASS/. Russia, China, and India have long maintained strong bonds of friendship and strategic partnership. During the plenary session of the Russia Calling! forum, Russian President Vladimir Putin underscored Moscow's ambition to elevate this cooperation to a new, more advanced level - specifically by enhancing its technological dimension.

Putin highlighted Russia's commitment to expanding collaboration with interested nations, noting that the majority of these countries - acting rationally and pragmatically - are eager to deepen their partnerships. He pointed out that over the past three years, Russia has notably increased its trade volume with these key allies, particularly China and India, countries with which Russia shares decades of friendship and strategic ties.

"I am aware that many representatives of Chinese and Indian delegations are present here today," Putin remarked. "I want to emphasize our goal to take our cooperation with the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India to a qualitatively new level by strengthening its technological component."

According to the Russian leader, numerous joint projects in energy, industry, space, agriculture, and many other areas are already aimed at this. "We have established a substantive dialogue with Chinese President Xi Jinping on economic issues, and we will also discuss these topics in detail during my upcoming visit to India with Prime Minister Narendra Modi," Putin stated.

MOSCOW, December 2. /TASS/. At a plenary session, the State Duma ratified an intergovernmental agreement between Russia and India on procedures for dispatching military personnel, as well as military ships and aircraft, to each other's territory. The Russian Cabinet of Ministers submitted the document to the lower house of parliament in November.

"The agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Republic of India on the procedures for dispatching military units, naval ships, and military aircraft of the Russian Federation to the territory of the Republic of India, and military units, naval ships, and military aircraft of the Republic of India to the territory of the Russian Federation, and the organization of their mutual logistical support, signed in Moscow on February 18, 2025, shall be ratified," the document states.

The explanatory note says that the agreement will streamline not only the dispatch of troops and equipment, but also their logistics. The established procedure will be used during joint exercises, training sessions, humanitarian aid, disaster relief efforts after natural and man-made disasters, and in other cases by agreement.

The Cabinet indicated that ratification of the document will simplify the mutual use of the two countries' airspace and the entry of Russian and Indian warships into each other's ports. Furthermore, the agreement will strengthen military cooperation between the two countries.

Release of convicted cocaine trafficker Juan Orlando Hernández is latest US interference in election and comes despite Trump's apparent ‘war on drugs'

Analysis: Trump's pardon of Honduras's ex-president shows counter-drug effort is ‘based on lies and hypocrisy'

A former president of Honduras who was convicted of drug trafficking has walked free from a US prison after receiving a pardon from Donald Trump, as the country's presidential election remained on a knife edge with the US-backed candidate leading by 515 votes.

Juan Orlando Hernández, who was sentenced to 45 years in prison for allegedly creating “a cocaine superhighway to the United States”, was released from a West Virginia prison after Trump's intervention, Hernández's wife confirmed on Tuesday.

It came as Trump steps up his “war on drugs” with airstrikes on alleged traffickers in the Caribbean, and a massive US naval force off the coast of Venezuela.

The pardon was issued amid extraordinary levels of US interference in the Honduran election. Trump threw his support behind Hernández's ally Nasry “Tito” Asfura, saying Washington's support for the country was conditional on an Asfura victory.

On Tuesday, Trump again intervened, alleging without evidence that electoral officials were “trying to change” the result of Sunday's vote and said: “If they do, there will be hell to pay!”

The virtual vote count had been slow and unstable before it was interrupted at about midday on Monday. The electoral council said a technical problem was to blame and insisted the manual count was continuing.

When the release of results was suspended, Asfura was on 39.91%, closely followed by another rightwing candidate, Salvador Nasralla, on 39.89%. Rixi Moncada, the candidate for the leftwing ruling party, was trailing in a distant third place with 19.16% of the vote.

As election officials pleaded for patience, Hernández's wife, Ana García de Hernández, disclosed that the former president had been released from a US prison.

“God is faithful and never fails! Yesterday, Monday 1 December 2025, we lived a day we will never forget. After almost four years of pain, waiting and difficult trials, my husband, Juan Orlando Hernández, became a free man AGAIN, thanks to the presidential pardon granted by President Donald Trump,” she wrote.

Axios reported that in a letter to Trump in October, Hernández had claimed that he had been “targeted by the Biden-Harris administration not for any wrongdoing, but for political reasons.”

US authorities had investigated Hernández for years before he was indicted; his brother, Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández, was arrested in 2018 and convicted in 2019, during Trump's first term.

Manhattan prosecutors accused the former president of allegedly receiving $1m from the former Mexican cartel kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán in 2013 for his first presidential campaign, and alleged that, under Hernández's government, Honduras served as a crucial transit point for cocaine coming from South American countries including Colombia and Venezuela.

Hernández had been held at the federal Hazelton prison in West Virginia and is now in a “safe place”, according to his wife.

Trump's pardon has baffled many observers, who have questioned why the US president has used his antinarcotics campaign to justify overthrowing Venezuela's dictator, Nicolás Maduro, while simultaneously freeing a man convicted of such crimes.

In Honduras, the pardon has been viewed as yet another attempt by the US president to interfere in the election.

Honduras's deputy foreign minister, Gerardo Torres Zelaya, posted that the US “got involved in our elections” and “freed the worst narco and criminal in our history”.

During the campaign, Moncada accused Trump of “interventionism” and of “imperial, direct foreign interference” in the electoral process. She served as finance minister under the current president, Xiomara Castro, who could not run again because presidential mandates are limited to a single term.

Before the election, Trump had claimed Moncada was a communist and that her victory would hand the country to “Maduro and his narco-terrorists”.

Nasralla, an experienced politician and TV host who served as Castro's vice-president before breaking away to launch his own presidential attempt, was labelled by Trump as a “borderline communist” who was running only to split the vote between Moncada and Asfura. Gustavo Irías, a co-founder and executive director of Honduras's Centre of Study for Democracy, said Trump's “interference definitely influenced the outcome” of the elections.

“Those messages from Trump validated a political party that was practically unable to win because of its long history of links to drug trafficking and corruption – and that suffered a massive defeat in 2021,” he said, referring to Castro's wide victory over Asfura in the last presidential election.

A similar strategy was adopted by the US president in October during Argentina's midterm elections, when Trump announced a $40bn bailout conditional on the victory of the far-right president Javier Milei's party.

“So people went to vote here under pressure, under fear,” Irías said.

The electoral council has up to 30 days to announce the result.

For many, the suspension of the vote counts has revived traumatic memories of the 2017 election, when Hernández ran for a second term, after a court struck down a constitutional ban on re-election.

Early results showed Nasralla ahead, but after a “blackout” – marked by violent protests in which dozens were killed – Hernández emerged ahead and, a week after the election, was recognised by the US as the winner.

Now, after a campaign in which virtually all the candidates alleged electoral fraud, all three contenders have voiced concern over the delay.“Let's not keep the country waiting on edge,” said Asfura.

Irías said that official results could take weeks to be finalised and that, given everything unfolding in this election, “we are going to see a continuation of governments with low legitimacy”.

“I hope the system does not return with completely different figures from those with which the count was halted, as happened in 2017, because that could open up a new and very serious crisis,” he added.

Russian president says European demands ‘not acceptable' as key talks begin in Moscow with Witkoff and Kushner

Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates

Vladimir Putin has accused Europe of standing in the way of US efforts to end the war in Ukraine, as he began key talks in the Kremlin with Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, and the US president's son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Witkoff, on his sixth trip to Moscow this year, is to present Putin with an updated version of a US peace proposal drafted with input from a senior Russian official and reworked to make it more acceptable to Kyiv. Images released through Russian state media showed the two delegations sat on opposite sides of an oval white table.

Moments before the closed-door meeting with Witkoff and Kushner, Putin made a series of hard-edged remarks. Speaking to reporters at the Kremlin, he accused European governments of sabotaging the peace process and said that “European demands” on ending the war in Ukraine were “not acceptable to Russia”.

“Europe is preventing the US administration from achieving peace on Ukraine,” Putin said, adding: “Russia does not intend to fight Europe, but if Europe starts, we are ready right now.”

Putin did not clarify which European demands he found unacceptable.

“They are on the side of war,” Putin said of European powers.

The two Trump allies arrived in Moscow on Tuesday after meeting Ukrainian officials at the weekend in Florida to discuss revisions to the original 28-point peace plan, which overwhelmingly favoured Moscow.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on a diplomatic push to rally support among European capitals that have backed changes to the original plan, said in Paris that the updated version of the proposal “looks better” but emphasised it was “not over yet”.

Zelenskyy has objected, in particular, to provisions in the 28-point plan that would have required Ukraine to surrender territory in the east that it currently controls, and impose limits on the size of its military. He has also demanded clear, enforceable security guarantees from the west to prevent a future Russian invasion.

Putin, for his part, has said that only the original US proposal could serve as a basis for further talks, while also stating that it required significant revisions.

Despite intense shuttle diplomacy in recent weeks, which has produced several revisions to the US peace plan, bridging the gap remains difficult: Russia's maximalist demands in effect require Ukraine's capitulation.

Trump said in remarks to a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that the Ukraine war was a “mess” and not an easy situation to resolve.

Most analysts believe the Kremlin is unlikely to accept substantial changes to the original document, casting doubt on the prospects of real progress in the talks.

But Putin's comments appeared aimed at driving a wedge between Washington and European capitals. European officials have had some success in pushing back against the original US plan, though it remains unclear to what extent Washington is taking their concerns into account.

The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, earlier on Tuesday said Putin and Witkoff would discuss the “understandings” reached recently between Washington and Kyiv, adding that Russia remained open to talks but would insist on achieving the goals of its “special operation”.

Those goals amount to sweeping demands that would severely erode Ukraine's sovereignty, including deep cuts to its armed forces, a ban on western military assistance, far-reaching limits on political independence, and the handover of Ukrainian-controlled territory in the east of the country.

On the eve of the talks with the US delegation in Moscow, Putin claimed Russian forces had taken control of the strategic city of Pokrovsk in Ukraine.

Dressed in military fatigues during a visit to a command centre on Monday evening, the Russian president hailed what he called the “important” capture of Pokrovsk, once a major logistical hub for the Ukrainian army, though Ukrainian officials later disputed the claim.

Russia has spent more than a year attempting to seize the frontline hub, seen as a gateway to Donetsk, and has suffered heavy losses in the process.

Ukrainian analysts and military bloggers have acknowledged that Russia now holds most of Pokrovsk, with battlefield maps showing its forces largely in control.

Buoyed up by recent gains at the front, Putin has indicated in recent weeks that the Russian military was prepared to keep fighting if diplomacy faltered, repeatedly emphasising that his forces remained on the offensive on the battlefield.

The Russian leader also on Tuesday threatened retaliation against Ukraine's ports and shipping after Kyiv in recent days struck several vessels in Russia's so-called shadow fleet in the Black Sea.

The Russian president threatened that Moscow would “step up strikes on Ukrainian ports and on any ships entering them” in response to attacks on Russian tankers, which he described as “piracy”.

Echoing the Kremlin, Russian state media on Tuesday struck a confident tone before the US visit. Komsomolskaya Pravda, often described as “Putin's favourite newspaper”, wrote that the president's remarks suggested “more and more Ukrainian territory is coming under our control – and that next time Russia's terms may be tougher”.

The paper implied that Moscow viewed the latest US-Ukrainian talks as a dead end, claiming Kyiv was refusing to capitulate: “The US has tried for the third time in the past 10 days to pressure Ukraine, and Washington has once again failed,” it wrote.

Defense secretary shares anecdote in The War on Warriors and rails against ‘rules and regulations' governing war

Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, told soldiers under his command in Iraq to ignore legal advice about when they were permitted to kill enemy combatants under their rules of engagement.

The anecdote is contained in a book Hegseth wrote last year in which he also repeatedly railed against the constraints placed on “American warfighters” by the laws of war and the Geneva conventions.

Hegseth is currently under scrutiny for a 2 September attack on a boat purportedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean, where survivors of a first strike on the vessel were reportedly killed in a second strike following a verbal order from Hegseth to “kill everybody”.

Hegseth has denied giving the order and retained the support of Donald Trump. The US president said Hegseth told him “he did not say that, and I believe him, 100%”. But some US senators have raised the possibility that the US war secretary committed a war crime.

In the book, The War on Warriors, Hegseth relates a story about a legal briefing at the beginning of his service in Iraq, in which he told the men under his command to ignore guidance from a military judge advocate general's (JAG) attorney's guidance about the rules of engagement in the conflict.

Hegseth writes that “upon arrival in Iraq”, the men were briefed “regarding the latest ‘in theater' rules of engagement”, adding: “Needless to say, no infantrymen like army lawyers – which is why JAG officers are often not so affectionately known as ‘jagoffs'.”

He added of JAG lawyers: “Most spend more time prosecuting our troops than they do putting away bad guys. It's easier to get promoted that way.”

Hegseth writes that in explaining the rules of engagement, the JAG officer “used the example of an identified enemy holding a rocket-propelled grenade”, asking Hegseth's platoon: “‘Do you shoot at him?'”

“And my guys were like, ‘Hell, yeah, we light him up,'” Hegseth writes.

According to Hegseth, the JAG officer responded: “‘Wrong answer, men. You are not authorized to fire at that man, until that RPG becomes a threat. It must be pointed at you with the intent to fire. That makes it a legal and proper engagement.'”

Hegseth writes that in response: “We sat in silence, stunned.”

He then instructed his men to ignore the legal advice.

“After this briefing, I pulled my platoon together, huddling amid their confusion to tell them, ‘I will not allow that nonsense to filter into your brains. Men, if you see an enemy who you believe is a threat, you engage and destroy the threat. That's a bullshit rule that's going to get people killed. And I will have your back – just like our commander. We are coming home, the enemy will not.'”

The Guardian contacted the Department of Defense for comment.

Prof David M Crane, a former chief prosecutor of the UN special court for Sierra Leone, distinguished scholar in residence at Syracuse University College of Law and an army veteran with 20 years' service, including stints as a JAG attorney, said obeying rules of engagement was crucial and that those who break them should face sanction.

“After the tragedy of My Lai in 1968, we have tried to avoid another one and prosecute those that do in fact stray. And that happened particularly in Iraq, at Fallujah, and other places in defense, where we had some marines go south and commit war crimes, and they're prosecuted for it,” he said.

He added: “These rules go all the way up the chain of command. I mean, it goes all the way to the president of the United States, who is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the United States.

“So if there's an illegal order that goes all the way down, then all of them have committed a war crime. It's not just a single guy in the airplane, the jet aircraft, firing those missiles at the boat. Yes, they are following an illegal order, but it goes all the way up all the way to the president.”

In his book, however, Hegseth called into question the entire edifice of laws of conflict, writing: “If our warriors are forced to follow rules arbitrarily and asked to sacrifice more lives so that international tribunals feel better about themselves, aren't we just better off winning our wars according to our own rules?! Who cares what other countries think.”

In Trump's first term, Hegseth successfully campaigned for the pardon of two army officers and the reversal of disciplinary measures on a Navy Seal, each of whom were either charged with or convicted of war crimes. He has expressed admiration for his former commanding officer, the now retired army colonel and, according to Hegseth, “certified badass” Michael Steele, who was reprimanded after reportedly ordering soldiers in 2006 in Iraq to “kill all military age males” in a raid.

Crane said of Hegseth's portrayal of a fundamental antagonism between JAG lawyers and soldiers that it was “absolutely not true”, and that “the bottom line is that judge advocates are soldiers who are lawyers, [and] whose job is to make sure soldiers don't commit violations of the laws of armed conflict, and the soldiers appreciate it”.

He added: “I have deployed around the world in some very scary places with my unit as their lawyer, but I did everything that my unit did: jumping on airplanes, scaling cliffs, doing all the things that you know about these very specialized organizations. I did it too. I was right there with them. They respected me. I respected them. And they listened to me.”

In the same passage of the book as his anecdote, Hegseth praises his then commander, who was later reprimanded for his own role in an incident in which unarmed Iraqis were killed by US soldiers.

He commends “Colonel Michael Steele … our brigade commander” as “a certified badass”, adding that Steele incentivized the killing of Iraqis: “He suffered no fools. If you engaged the enemy and destroyed it under his command, you got a ‘kill coin'.”

Hegseth adds: “Colonel Steele would have been a horrible gender studies professor at the University of California, but there was nobody you wanted more in a combat situation.”

Steele was commander of the 3rd Brigade, 187th Infantry Regiment in the 101st Airborne Division between 2004 and 2006, under whom Hegseth served as a platoon commander.

In 2006, four soldiers under his command were charged with the murder of unarmed Iraqis during a raid in Salahuddin province, and in sworn statements the men said Steele had “ordered them to kill all military-age males”.

Media reports at that time indicated that Steele had promoted body counts as a measure of performance, with the New York Times reporting of Steele that “in Iraq, as a commander involved in harrowing assaults against insurgents, he inspired the use of ‘kill boards' to track how many Iraqis each soldier had killed over time”.

In 2007, the New York Times reported that Steele had been formally reprimanded for issuing improper orders for the raid, effectively blocking his further promotion, and had been rotated out of Iraq to an administrative assignment.

Crane said: “You know, we have commanders who are ‘badasses' – and most of them don't go into higher rank, because they're quietly removed from the service, or they're court-martialed and removed, or reprimanded, or put in jail.”

He added: “Colonel Steele was completely outside the bounds. That mentality is frowned upon, and that's why he was reprimanded and his career was ended.”

He said: “This shows you the mindset of this secretary of defense: that's the kind of person, that's the signal they're sending the commanders – kill them all and let God sort them out.”

In the book, Hegseth ventilates more general grievances about legal restraints placed on soldiers in combat.

At one point, Hegseth writes: “We send men to fight on our behalf, and then second-guess the manner in which they fight. I saw it every day.”

Hegseth adds: “In some cases, our units were so boxed in by rules and regulations and political correctness, we even second-guess ourselves. That needs to end. Count me out on the Monday-morning quarterbacking – I'm with the American warfighter, all the way.”

Elsewhere, Hegseth appears to argue that American soldiers should proceed without any constraints whatsoever.

He writes: “If we're going to send our boys to fight – and it should be boys – we need to unleash them to win. They need them to be the most ruthless. The most uncompromising. The most overwhelmingly lethal as they can be. We must break the enemy's will.”

Hegseth adds an apparent call for virtual impunity for serving soldiers, writing: “Our troops will make mistakes, and when they do, they should get the overwhelming benefit of the doubt.”

The idea that soldiers should be given the benefit of the doubt echoes comments Hegseth made in November 2019, after Trump pardoned Clint Lorance, then serving a 19-year sentence for the murder of two civilians; Maj Mathew Golsteyn, who was facing murder charges over the killing of an unarmed Afghan civilian; and reversed the demotion of Navy Seal Edward Gallagher, who in July 2019 was found not guilty of murder over the death of an IS captive, but was convicted for posing for photos with the man's corpse.

At that time, Hegseth, still a news presenter but widely credited for influencing Trump to clear the men, told the Fox News audience that Trump had shown “fidelity to the warfighter”.

“The president looks at it through that lens, a simple one, and important one. The benefit of the doubt should go to the guys pulling the trigger.”

Crane said that such pardons “cheapen the profession. Having been in the military myself there's a great amount of pride among the professionals within the US armed forces, and they take great pride in following the law and doing things appropriately under law.”

He added: “The force is irritated now and embarrassed because they truly believe in separating themselves from politics, and they are America's armed forces, not the president's armed forces.”

Hello, this is Chris York, reporting from Kyiv on day 1,378 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

While the international focus remains on Trump's peace deal negotiations in Moscow, our focus in this blog is on updates from the front:

Our top story so far:

Drones launched by Ukraine's military intelligence struck Russian air defense systems in occupied Donbas, the agency claimed on Dec. 2, knocking out a launcher from a S-300 SAM system, and two 1L125 Niobium-SV radar stations.

"Such strikes significantly reduce the ability of Muscovites to control the airspace over Donbas and create conditions for new air operations of the Defense Forces of Ukraine," HUR said in a post on Telegram.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report.

Ukraine expects up to $16 billion of U.S. weapons in 2026, provided under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), Aliona Hetmanchuk, the head of Ukraine's mission to NATO said on Dec. 2.

The PURL initiative, launched earlier this year, enables NATO allies to buy advanced U.S. weaponry for Ukraine.

"It is very important for us that the end of 2025 does not become the end of the program. Next year, we expect to ensure the supply of American weapons worth $12 to $16 billion," Hetmanchuk said in comments reported by Ukrainska Pravda.

Last updated 2:21 p.m. Kyiv time.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained British citizen Ross David Cutmore, who came to Ukraine as a military instructor, on suspicion of working for Russian intelligence, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 2.

The security agency announced Cutmore's detention on Oct. 29 without disclosing his name at the time, presenting him as a "former military instructor" from Europe who was covertly working for Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) from Kyiv.

A number of foreign veterans have flocked to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022 to serve as instructors or volunteers in the Ukrainian military.

Cutmore, reportedly a former British soldier who was deployed in the Middle East, arrived in Ukraine in early 2024 to train Ukrainian soldiers in the use of firearms and tactical skills.

Several months later, the military trainer left the job and reached out to Russian intelligence services with an offer of collaboration, seeking "easy money," the SBU said in October.

According to the investigation, Cutmore was passing information on Ukraine's military to Russia and was plotting unspecified "terrorist attacks." The suspect is in custody and faces up to 12 years in prison.

A Russian oil tanker reportedly came under a drone attack in the Black Sea while en route to a port in northern Turkey on Dec. 2, according to Turkish authorities.

"The tanker MIDVOLGA-2, carrying sunflower oil from Russia to Georgia, reported being attacked 80 miles off our coast," the Turkish Transport Ministry wrote on X on Dec. 2. "Currently, there are no casualties among the 13 crew members, and the vessel has not requested assistance. The ship is proceeding toward Sinop under its own power."

According to Marine Traffic, an online ship-tracking platform, the Midvolga-2 is an oil and chemical tanker just under 140 meters long and sails under the Russian flag.

Citing unnamed Turkish officials, Bloomberg reported that the Midvolga-2 was struck by sea drones.

Eighty miles would be outside Turkey's territorial waters but well within its Exclusive Economic Zone.

There has been no confirmation or even official mention of Ukraine in connection to the attack on the Midvolga-2, but it follows a series of recent Ukrainian strikes on Russia's “shadow fleet” — vessels that skirt sanctions to sell Russian fossil fuels abroad. These strikes have typically used “Sea Baby” naval drones.

At least six people were killed and 24 others injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine from the evening of Nov. 30 to the morning of Dec. 1, according to authorities.

Ukraine's Air Force said Dec. 1 that Russia launched 62 strike drones of various types, including Shahed-type drones, from several directions in Russia and occupied Crimea. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 39 of them, while 20 drones hit eight locations.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a Russian ballistic missile struck Dnipro industrial area on Dec. 1, killing four people and injuring 45 others, local authorities said. A further two people were injured in drone strikes later in the day.

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, one person was killed and three injured, Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.

In Sumy Oblast, one person was killed and another injured when a drone struck a car in the Bilopil community, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration said.

In Kharkiv Oblast, six civilians were injured as Russian forces attacked six settlements over the past day, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram.

In Kherson Oblast, 13 people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Telegram.

Russia has lost about 1,173,920 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Dec. 1.

The figure includes 1,110 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day, according to the report.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,387 tanks, 23,679 armored fighting vehicles, 68,641 vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,768 artillery systems, 1,552 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,253 air defense systems, 430 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 86,141 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

Hello, this is Chris York, reporting from Kyiv on day 1,378 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

While the international focus remains on Trump's peace deal negotiations in Moscow, our focus in this blog is on updates from the front:

Our top story so far:

Drones launched by Ukraine's military intelligence struck Russian air defense systems in occupied Donbas, the agency claimed on Dec. 2, knocking out a launcher from a S-300 SAM system, and two 1L125 Niobium-SV radar stations.

"Such strikes significantly reduce the ability of Muscovites to control the airspace over Donbas and create conditions for new air operations of the Defense Forces of Ukraine," HUR said in a post on Telegram.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report.

Ukraine expects up to $16 billion of U.S. weapons in 2026, provided under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), Aliona Hetmanchuk, the head of Ukraine's mission to NATO said on Dec. 2.

The PURL initiative, launched earlier this year, enables NATO allies to buy advanced U.S. weaponry for Ukraine.

"It is very important for us that the end of 2025 does not become the end of the program. Next year, we expect to ensure the supply of American weapons worth $12 to $16 billion," Hetmanchuk said in comments reported by Ukrainska Pravda.

Last updated 2:21 p.m. Kyiv time.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained British citizen Ross David Cutmore, who came to Ukraine as a military instructor, on suspicion of working for Russian intelligence, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 2.

The security agency announced Cutmore's detention on Oct. 29 without disclosing his name at the time, presenting him as a "former military instructor" from Europe who was covertly working for Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) from Kyiv.

A number of foreign veterans have flocked to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022 to serve as instructors or volunteers in the Ukrainian military.

Cutmore, reportedly a former British soldier who was deployed in the Middle East, arrived in Ukraine in early 2024 to train Ukrainian soldiers in the use of firearms and tactical skills.

Several months later, the military trainer left the job and reached out to Russian intelligence services with an offer of collaboration, seeking "easy money," the SBU said in October.

According to the investigation, Cutmore was passing information on Ukraine's military to Russia and was plotting unspecified "terrorist attacks." The suspect is in custody and faces up to 12 years in prison.

Scotiabank reported fourth-quarter earnings of $2.2-billion, or $1.65 per share, on Monday.Chris Wattie/Reuters

Bank of Nova Scotia BNS-T reported higher fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates as activity in capital markets and wealth management surged, offsetting a restructuring charge aimed at cutting costs.

Scotiabank earned $2.2-billion, or $1.65 per share, in the three months ended Oct.31. That compared with $1.69-billion, or $1.22 per share, in the same quarter last year. 

Adjusted to exclude certain items, including a restructuring charge and severance provisions, the bank said it earned $1.93 per share. That edged out the $1.84 per share analysts expected, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. 

“We delivered improving results through the year as we strengthened our balance sheet, improved our loan-to-deposit ratio, and increased return on equity,” Scotiabank chief executive officer Scott Thomson said in a statement. 

The bank kept its quarterly dividend unchanged at $1.10 per share. 

Scotiabank is the first major bank to release earnings for the three months ended Oct. 31. Royal Bank of Canada RY-T and National Bank of Canada NA-T will report results on Wednesday. Toronto-Dominion Bank TD-T, Bank of Montreal BMO-T, and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CM-T will wrap up earnings week on Thursday. 

In the quarter, Scotiabank set aside $1.1-billion in provisions for credit losses – the funds banks set aside to cover loans that may default – and included $71-million against loans that are still being repaid, based on models that use economic forecasting to predict future losses. 

In the same quarter last year, Scotiabank set aside $1.03-billion in provisions. 

Total revenue rose 15 per cent in the quarter to $9.8-billion. But expenses increased 10 per cent to $5.8-billion, which the bank said was driven by higher personnel costs, technology and business development. 

Profit from Canadian banking was $941-million, up 1 per cent from a year earlier, driven by higher private equity gains, mutual fund distribution fees and insurance income. Loan balances were up 2 per cent year over year. 

Profit from the bank's international division was up 6 per cent to $634-million. 

The global wealth management division generated $447-million of profit, up 18 per cent. And capital markets profit jumped 50 per cent to $519-million on stronger activity in the United States.

MOSCOW/NEW DELHI, December 2. /TASS/. Proposals for a settlement in Ukraine prepared by US President Donald Trump's administration are a good basis for a final agreement, Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov stated at a briefing for Indian media ahead of the Russia-India summit in New Delhi.

He also noted that Europeans simply want to steal Russian money and spend it on supporting Kiev's "war machine."

TASS has summed up the Kremlin representative's key statements.

Russia continues to be "a crucial energy supplier to India" at competitive prices: "And we have no doubt that this trade brings enormous benefits to India and is mutually beneficial at the same time."

Bilateral relations between Russia and India are based "on a deep historical experience of mutual understanding, partnership, and a shared vision of world events and a global system based on international law, the rule of law, and the ability to consider each other's interests."

In its relations with India, Russia is focused on developing bilateral cooperation, protected from external interference: "What concerns us is how we are going to continue and increase the volume of our bilateral business with India without allowing anyone to interfere in it. And this will certainly be discussed."

Almost all trade between Russia and India is conducted in national currencies: "This is very important because in this way we protect our trade, the sovereignty of both countries, Russia and India, and our trade cooperation."

The Kremlin expects that Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to India "will be successful."

Russia expects to increase imports from India, as there is currently an imbalance in trade between the two countries: "We know that our Indian friends are concerned about this. By the way, we are jointly seeking opportunities to increase imports from India to Russia. We want to buy more from India."

Russia "hopes for the continuation" of cooperation with India in nuclear sector projects.

Russia "highly values" India's position on the Ukrainian settlement and New Delhi's readiness to contribute to the search for peace.

The fact that Europeans do not want to listen to Russia on the topic of Ukraine and the absence of dialogue is a problem: "We are not talking to Europeans. We have no dialogue, not a single word. So how can you know your colleagues' position on such a complex problem if you don't talk to each other? This is our biggest problem."

European countries are talking about war "until the last Ukrainian," while the Trump administration is "making enormous efforts" toward a settlement in Ukraine.

Russia wants peace, but its concerns must be taken into account.

Russia is open to peace negotiations, but the goals set at the beginning of the special military operation must be achieved: "We must achieve our goals, and we must eliminate the initial reasons for the military operation we started."

An agreement on a Ukrainian settlement must include the elimination of the causes of the special military operation: "We want peace. Why don't we conclude a peace agreement immediately? It's very difficult. There were root causes for our president's decision to start the special military operation. And first, we must come to an agreement in a way that eliminates these root causes."

US mediation on Ukraine is "very effective."

Trump's peace plan creates a good basis for agreements on Ukraine: "Trump's plan is a very good basis for this, and we hope we can adhere to this basis."

The forthcoming meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US the president's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff will last as long as necessary, Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said.

"No, [the talks between Putin and Witkoff will last] as long as necessary," the Kremlin spokesman said, responding to a question about whether a specific time limit is allocated for the meeting according to protocol.

Europeans simply want to steal Russian money and spend it on supporting Kiev's "war machine": "They [Europeans] are discussing the possibility of stealing Russian assets that remain blocked in Europe. That's more than $200 billion."

Statements by European politicians about a Russian threat are nonsense: "They [European politicians] say they are afraid of Russia, that Russia is dangerous for Europe. But that's nonsense."

National currencies are increasingly being used in world trade, while the dollar's share is steadily declining: "This is not a fast, but a very steady trend that will continue in the coming years."

Russia, together with other countries, is considering developing alternative payment systems: "We continue to think together about how to create bilateral or multilateral systems that could become an alternative to systems that can be used as a political tool to put pressure on certain countries."

Russia remains open to foreign investment, with businesses from various countries showing interest despite the sanctions.

MOSCOW, December 2. /TASS/. Paris is still looking for ways to take a direct part in the Ukraine conflict, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) said in a press release.

"France is eager to send its troops to Ukraine. The press bureau of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) of the Russian Federation informs that, according to the information coming to the SVR, France is still seeking ways to directly participate in the conflict in Ukraine," the press release reads. The SVR cited a French government decree authorizing the use of private military companies (PMCs) for assistance to "a third state facing an armed conflict."

According to the SVR, even a "politically unsophisticated ordinary European" would guess what country is implied in the document. "Mobile air defense groups and the limited number of F-16 Fighting Falcons available to Ukraine are unable to intercept Russian air targets. Learning how to operate Mirage Fighter Jets and other machinery requires a lot of time and a high level of expertise," the SVR argued. "This is why Kiev will need foreign PMCs equipped with modern Western, primarily French, weaponry," it explained.

However, the SVR cautioned Paris against deluding itself into thinking that "this will allow it to untie its hands and simultaneously evade responsibility for its troops' participation in the conflict." "The presence of French PMCs in Ukraine, modestly referred to as `reference operators' of the Ministry of Armed Forces in the aforementioned decree, will be considered by Moscow as France's direct engagement in hostilities against Russia," the SVR warned. "Consequently, French PMCs will become a high-priority legal target for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation," the SVR concluded.

            The world's longest and deepest undersea road tunnel is being built in Norway, intended to cut travel time between major cities and become part of a ferry-free highway along its western coast.
    


            The 27-kilometer (17-mile) long tunnel is called Rogfast — short for “Rogaland fastforbindelse,” after the name of the region it's in and the Norwegian word for “fixed link.” At its deepest it will be 392 meters (1,286 feet) below sea level.
    


            Construction started in January 2018 but was halted in late 2019 due to predicted cost overruns that led to the cancellation of existing contracts and a restructuring of the project. Work resumed in late 2021 and the tunnel is now slated for completion in 2033, at a cost of approximately 25 billion Norwegian kroner (about $2.4 billion).
    


            “The tunnel will significantly improve connectivity along the Norwegian west coast, by creating a faster and more reliable link between the Stavanger and Haugesund regions,” said Anne Brit Moen, a project manager at Skanska, the multinational construction company that's building the northern part of the tunnel, which is the deepest section and is 9 kilometers (5.5 miles) long.
    


            By replacing the current ferry connections, Rogfast will reduce travel time between Bergen and Stavanger — respectively the second and fourth largest Norwegian cities by population — by around 40 minutes and make daily commuting much easier, Moen added.
    


            The tunnel will consist of two separate tubes, each with two traffic lanes, designed exclusively for road traffic, and will sport a rather unusual design element roughly halfway through: a double roundabout, 260 meters deep, linking out to a connection tunnel leading to the island of Kvitsøy, Norway's smallest municipality.
    


            Building a tunnel of that length under the sea poses several technological challenges. Like most modern tunnels, to save time, Rogfast is being built from both ends concurrently, with the goal of having the two construction teams meet in the middle within a margin of error of just 5 centimeters (1.97 inches).
    


            Achieving this level of precision requires careful measurements using lasers and other sophisticated equipment. A spinning, mirrored laser scanner measures a newly excavated tunnel portion, collecting 2 million data points per second to create a “digital twin” of the tunnel. That can then to be checked against the design plans for any inaccuracies.
    


            “It's a little bit away from the romantic view of the of the surveyor looking through an eyepiece,” said Burkhard Boeckem, chief technology officer at Hexagon, the company that is providing the measurements for the tunnel.
    


            The 5-centimeter (1.9-inch) margin is among the strictest in the world, but can save time, money, waste, and emissions by avoiding mistakes: “If you deviate from this, you create so much more material that needs to be taken out, and then so much more to be filled in again — it's a lot of whole trucks. So, it's not just a risk factor, but also a very financial factor.”
    


            The Rogfast project is part of a revamp of the E39 coastal highway, a 1,100 kilometer (684-mile) road that runs from Trondheim in the north to Kristiansand in the south. Today it takes 21 hours to drive the entire length of the road, which includes seven ferries. The goal is to make it ferry-free by building tunnels and bridges, cutting travel time in half. Completion is not expected before 2050.
    


            Rogfast is one of the most ambitious and technically demanding components of that plan, and construction hasn't been hurdle-free, according to Moen. “The main challenge so far has been to find good enough grouting methods to seal the rock,” she explained. “We are now 300 meters (984 feet) below sea level, and we have already had quite extensive saltwater leaks in the tunnel system. Since we are going all the way down to 392 meters (1,286 feet) below sea level, we're focusing on finding the best methods to maintain safe and efficient working conditions for everyone.”
    


            The tunnel also requires measures to protect motorists from air pollution. It will employ a longitudinal ventilation system — which typically use jet fans to create airflow — complemented by shaft ventilation extending up to Kvitsøy. “This combination is designed to ensure effective air circulation and safety throughout the tunnel's considerable length,” said Moen.
    


            A real-time incident alert will also be implemented to identify events such as breakdowns or congestion, and cameras and radar will monitor vehicles.
    


            Although jobs would be eventually lost from ferry closures, Rogfast will strengthen access to other jobs, education, and public services for local communities, Moen said, and have positive effects on the local economy and the seafood industry, as logistics costs will go down and companies will be able to operate across a wider area. “The project also creates substantial employment during construction and lays the groundwork for more sustainable and integrated regional development along Norway's fractured western coastline,” she said.
    


            Currently, the title of world's longest tunnel with an undersea section belongs to the Seikan Tunnel in Northern Japan, a railway-only tunnel that has a total length of 53.85 kilometers (33.5 miles), with an undersea section spanning 23.3 kilometers (14.5 miles).
    


            The Channel Tunnel, which is also railway-only and connects England to France, is shorter, at 50.46 kilometers (31.35 miles), but its 37.9 km (23.5-mile) undersea section is longer than Rogfast. Rogfast, however, will be much deeper below sea level than either Seikan or the Channel Tunnel, which bottom out respectively at 240 meters (790 feet), and 115 meters (377 feet).

LONDON, December 2. /TASS/. The European Central Bank (ECB) has refused to provide a backstop for a €140 billion reparations loan to Ukraine underpinned by Russia's immobilized assets, the Financial Times (FT) reported.

The euro-zone regulator concluded that the Ukraine loan proposal put forward by the European Commission (EC) violated its mandate, the British newspaper reported, citing officials.

The officials had asked the ECB whether it could act as a lender of last resort to Euroclear Bank, the lending arm of the Belgium-based central securities depository, to avoid a liquidity crisis, people familiar with the discussions told the FT. ECB officials told the EC this was impossible.

The newspaper cited an internal analysis by the ECB in which the regulator concluded that the EC's initiative was equivalent to providing direct funding to governments, as the central bank would then cover the financial obligations of EU member states. However, this practice is banned in EU treaties as it can result in high inflation and loss of central bank credibility, the FT argued.

Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warned that Russia's response would be very harsh and painful if EU countries use frozen Russian assets to issue a "reparations loan" to Ukraine.

Olivia Nuzzi was the blonde purveyor of gossipy magazine pieces, a Hunter S Thompson in high heels patrolling the inner sanctum of Trump world.

Ryan Lizza, 20 years her senior, was chief Washington correspondent for Politico, the wonkish political news site. Together they were the golden couple of Washington journalism.

Last year, their relationship exploded in public fashion when it emerged she had an alleged affair with Robert F Kennedy Jr while she was reporting on his run for the White House.

Her book, American Canto, is published on Tuesday with a fresh wave of revelations. It details her affair with Mr Kennedy but comes with a slew of new details.

She describes how the man who is now Donald Trump's health secretary was taking psychedelic drugs during his run for president, how her brother offered to kill her ex-fiance when he allegedly threatened to share intimate messages with the press, and how she could have saved her job with Vanity Fair magazine if she had written a tell-all account of the affair.

Yet it lands as the latest salvo in an extraordinary media break-up.

Lizza, 51, beat her to the punch with a string of blog posts during the past fortnight.

In his first round of recriminations, he alleged that Nuzzi had an affair with Mark Sanford, a former presidential candidate and Republican politician from South Carolina, in 2020.

Then he published lines of toe-curling poetry, with apparent allusions to oral sex, that he attributed to Mr Kennedy.

“I mean to squeeze your cheeks to force open your mouth... I am a river. You are my canyon. I mean to flow through you. I mean to subdue and tame you. My love,” it ran.

The timing of his interventions (four so far) followed what should have been the start of a marketing blitz for Nuzzi's memoir.

The New York Times ran a complimentary profile under the headline “Olivia Nuzzi did it all for love,” complete with black and white photographs that cast her as the “modern iteration of a Hitchcock blonde”.

The result is that Nuzzi's book arrives amid frantic anticipation in the US media world.

The 31-year-old tells her side of the story as details of her affair with RFK Jr – referred to only as “The Politician” throughout – began leaking into the public a year ago.

Her job at New York magazine was on the line, and she describes her increasing fear that her life was imploding. She begins to see threats everywhere, asking a friend to help search her car for GPS trackers.

At one point her brother even seems to suggest killing Lizza for allegedly offering “a trove of intimate materials” to the press.

The alleged affair is believed to have begun in 2023, when the reporter was covering Mr Kennedy's independent run for president.

New York Magazine placed her on leave last year as news of the affair spread last September.

At the time, she acknowledged having an “emotional relationship” with him but insisted it did not affect her coverage of his campaign.

Yet in her book, she confirms one of Lizza's revelations, that she helped RFK Jr manage his media image.

In the course of her reporting, she stumbled across one of the most fascinating stories of the whole 2024 election, the tale of how RFK Jr dumped a dead bear cub in Manhattan's Central Park a decade earlier.

Rather than make it the centrepiece of the profile she was writing, she advises him to try to get “ahead of the story,” presenting it in the most favourable light.

“By get ahead of the story,” she continues, “I did not mean to suggest that he should appear on camera to introduce the facts through a more entertaining story than his enemies could ever dream of planting in the press to a shocked and horrified-looking Roseanne Barr.” Which is what happened.

Nor did she report on his drug use at the time.

She writes: “The Politician still did some psychedelics for fun, he said. He described how he waited until his wife was not home to go outside and smoke DMT, just as he waited until she wasn't home to call [me], or else he would call while locked in the bathroom.”

Nuzzi describes how she even helped him make the decision about who to endorse when he ended his independent run, asking how he would feel standing on stage pledging his support to Republicans or Democrats.

“I had not before now observed him like this, so unsure of himself and so worried,” she writes.

“He was exhausted, and he threw himself onto the bed, his pink shirt unbuttoned, revealing my favourite parts of his chest, and his blue tie still tied loose around his neck.”

Her worst fear at that moment is that “The Politician's” meeting to endorse Mr Trump could coincide with her appointment to interview the then former president, an adept reader of people and their affairs.

“He might at least clock enough data to wonder, and when the president wondered, he wondered aloud,” she writes.

In the end, their meetings were scheduled a day apart.

As the clock ticked towards the publication of Nuzzi's book, Lizza released his fourth post on his ex. He wrote how last year he found a draft of what would become “American Canto”.

“In hindsight, I believe she wanted me to find it – Olivia once conceded this, though at other times she denied it – and I believe she wanted the world to find out that she and Bobby loved each other,” he said.

Mr Kennedy, who has been married to Cheryl Hines, an actress, for more than a decade, has denied having an affair with Ms Nuzzi.

His spokesman has claimed that he “only met Olivia Nuzzi once in his life for an interview she requested, which yielded a hit piece”.

Mr Sanford, when previously contacted for comment by The Telegraph, did not respond.

American figure skater Andrew Torgashev was at an invitation-only camp organized by U.S. Figure Skating not long ago, a chance for elite athletes preparing for the high-level Grand Prix season to work out any flaws in their performances.

He tried a quad toe loop, a four-revolution jump where skaters launch from the back outside edge of their blade with the help of a toe pick from the other foot. The jump itself is the easiest of skating's six primary jumps, but four revolutions ups the difficulty.

To the naked eye, Torgashev landed it perfectly. To the camera watching him, Torgashev landed a quarter-revolution short.

It was a small error, to be sure, but the kind that could make the difference in whether Torgashev medals in a sport where tenths and even hundredths of a point matter. And he knew instantly thanks to feedback he received from the camera – or, more accurately, the app it was running, designed by a pair of computer whiz kids with no background in skating, but who saw in the sport a chance to not only help athletes in training but perhaps someday assist in the actual scoring of competitions.

The app is called OOFSkate, and powered by AI technology it analyzes from a tablet or mobile phone a skater's jump height, rotation speed, airtime and even landing quality. It provides skaters with feedback without having to wear sensors or other technology.

“Our vision for the system is to automate the technical calling of the sport,” said Jerry Lu, who along with his old college roommate, Jacob Blindenbach, have built out the system. “This manifests itself in a combination of using AI-assisted computer vision, but also the knowledge of figure skating, essentially taking out the stuff that should be judged without subjectivity.”

In other words, let humans judge the artistic side of the sport. Let computers handle the technical stuff.

“What are the things that go into a particular jump? We're trying to measure those things as a semi-automated technical assistant,” Lu told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of this week's Grand Prix Final, one of the premier events in the sport. “But also, it's a coaching tool that teachers around the country can use to evaluate their own athletes.”

The system itself seems remarkably simple: It uses a phone or tablet camera to capture a skater in motion, then overlays the key points of a jump or spin – the idealized version of a given element – and records the metrics that technical panels typically use.

Instantly, a coach or judge can know whether a skater completed three full turns of a triple lutz, or landed on the correct blade edge for a salchow. They can know how high the skater jumped, which is one of the judging criteria, and how fast they were spinning.

It also helps the individual skater, who can marry the jump they have just done in practice against what they may have done in the past, or even compare the way they are performing any given element against the way the best have performed it.

In the case of U.S. Figure Skating, a team library will allow them to compare their skills to benchmark data collected over the years.

“So if I'm Andrew Torgashev and I'm at Champs Camp,” Lu said, “I can do a quad toe loop and can compare it against myself, along with all the other athletes that have executed this. ‘Am I spinning as well as Mikhail Shaidorov? Or a previous version of myself?'”

Lu and Blindenbach met while studying at the University of Virginia, where both were swimmers. They were drawn to ways emerging technology could help athletes in the water, such as accelerometers that better measure an athlete's performance.

They went separate ways upon graduation, Lu to the MIT Sports Lab in Massachusetts and Blindenbach to Columbia in New York to specialize in artificial intelligence. But they stayed in touch, thinking up ways they could implement technology in other sports.

“We thought this would be a way to push the Olympic sports we love,” Blindenbach said.

It was NBC, which has the broadcast rights to the Summer and Winter Games in the U.S., that ultimately brought the pair into the figure skating world. The network asked them to conceive of some kind of technology that could help its analysts, former Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir, with providing their commentary in real time.

U.S. Figure Skating got on board with the project, realizing its potential to help train its high-level athletes. Olympic skaters Jason Brown and Alysa Liu, along with her coach, Massimo Scali, have provided feedback. And almost weekly, Lu or Blindenbach head to the revered Skating Club of Boston, where they are able to put the latest iteration of their system to the test.

It could be a revolutionary moment in a sport that often changes at a glacial pace.

“At least from what I can tell, they all seem very open,” Lu said. “They love the sport, first of all. Whatever we can do to help the sport grow and become better, they would do. They are very inclusive of us being there, and shadowing them throughout the day. How do they train, how do they interact with coaches? It's an artistic sport but it's also an athletic sport.”

The name OOFSkate originally came from what skaters tend to say after seeing their feedback from a jump — as in, “Oof, that wasn't very good!” Then, one of the folks at U.S. Figure Skating gave it a second meaning: “Obsessed over form.”

Indeed, the ability of OOFSkate to take the subjectivity out of judging form is intriguing, much like similar technology has taken the subjectivity out of line calls in tennis, and promises to take the same subjectivity out of balls and strikes in baseball.

“If someone under-rotates,” Blindenbach explained, “that should always be called. There shouldn't be a missed call or a controversy because something doesn't play out. Sometimes a position makes it hard (for a judge) to see if they're on an edge or off an edge on a lutz or a flip. We hope that AI can make the sport more fair.”

Lu and Blindenbach are wary about looking too far ahead, though. Hawk-Eye, the system that uses high-speed cameras to track the flight of tennis balls and determine whether they land inbounds or out, was pioneered in the early 2000s, and just this past year did the All-England Club decide to replace human line judges with the system at Wimbledon.

When it comes to the Olympics, the fact that Omega is its official data provider provides another obstacle in implementation.

So given the slow pace of technological adoption, Lu and Blindenbach are focused for now on fine-tuning the system to help coaches, athletes and commentators better do their jobs, especially as many prepare for the Milan Cortina Olympics in February.

“We don't want to step on toes,” Blindenbach said. “When you go fully AI and take the human out of the loop, people generally get mad, and the results are poor. We want to assist. If that's jump height or rotation, or if someone under-rotates by a quarter, these are easy things to do with AI, relatively speaking, compared to trying to capture something artistic. That's where we see ourselves.”

Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports from Paris, France on new details in the daring daylight Louvre jewel heist and Interpol's role in tracking the suspects.

Following the recent devastating heist at the Louvre in Paris, officials are doubling down on security precautions by implementing new policies and technology that don't come cheap.

In an effort to leverage the costs, the Louvre is raising prices by targeting a specific group of visitors.

Beginning on Jan. 14, foreigners from outside the European Union will have to pay $12 more than a typical ticket, The Associated Press reported.

Tickets will rise from $25 to $37 for non-EU citizens.

Nearly 9 million people visited the Louvre in 2024, with 77% of the 8.7 million tourists being of foreign nationality. About 13% of the visitors were American, according to AP.

Luigi Mangione watched stoically Monday as prosecutors played surveillance videos of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing on a New York City sidewalk and of Mangione's arrest five days later at a Pennsylvania McDonald's.

NEW YORK (AP) — A Pennsylvania police officer responding to a tip from the manager of a McDonald's testified Tuesday about confronting Luigi Mangione during the intense manhunt last year for UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killer.

As soon as Mangione doffed his medical mask at the restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Officer Joseph Detwiler said, “I knew” he was the suspect whose face had been all over the news since the shooting five days earlier on a Manhattan sidewalk.

“It's him … I'm not kidding. He's real nervous, and he didn't talk too much,” Detwiler told a supervisor by phone from the restaurant parking lot moments after meeting Mangione, according to the officer's body-camera video. It was played in court Tuesday, the second day of a hearing about evidence in the case.

Mangione indeed said little initially to Detwiler and another officer, giving only what turned out to be a false name, home state and driver's license. But Detwiler testified that he'd noticed the man's fingers shaking as they interacted and officers patted him down.

Over the ensuing minutes, Mangione placidly ate a hash brown as the officers waited for colleagues and claimed they were simply responding to loitering concerns at the eatery.

“I was trying to keep him calm,” Detwiler told the court, adding that he at one point started whistling over the restaurant's holiday-season music to “make him think that nothing was different about this call than any other call.”

Lawyers for Mangione, 27, want to block prosecutors from showing or telling jurors at his eventual Manhattan trial about statements he allegedly made and items authorities said they seized from his backpack during his arrest. The objects include a 9 mm handgun that prosecutors say matches the one used in the killing and a notebook in which they say Mangione described his intent to “wack” a health insurance executive.




The defense contends the items should be excluded because police didn't get a warrant before searching Mangione's backpack. They also want to suppress some statements Mangione made to law enforcement personnel, such as allegedly giving a false name, because officers started asking questions before telling him he had a right to remain silent.

The laws concerning how police interact with potential suspects before reading their rights or obtaining search warrants are complex and often disputed in criminal cases.

In Mangione's case, crucial questions will include whether he believed he was free to leave at the point when he spoke to the arresting officers, and whether there were “exigent circumstances” that merited searching his backpack before getting a warrant.

Detwiler testified that he never told Mangione he couldn't leave, nor mentioned the New York shooting. Defense lawyers, however, have argued in court filings that officers “strategically” stood in a way that prevented him from leaving.

Mangione, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison, while federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Neither trial has been scheduled.

Mangione's lawyers want to bar evidence from both cases, but this week's hearing pertains only to the state case.

Manhattan prosecutors haven't yet laid out their arguments for allowing the disputed evidence. Their federal counterparts have said in court filings that police were justified in searching the backpack to ensure there were no dangerous items and that Mangione's statements to officers were voluntary and made before he was under arrest.

Five witnesses testified on Monday, including a Pennsylvania prison officer who said Mangione told him that, when arrested, he had a backpack with foreign currency and a 3D-printed pistol.

Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind as the executive walked to a midtown Manhattan hotel for his company's annual investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. Prosecutors say “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase insurance industry critics use to describe how companies avoid paying claims.

Thompson, 50, worked at the giant UnitedHealth Group for 20 years and became CEO of its insurance arm in 2021. He was married and had children who were in high school.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and GOP candidate Matt Van Epps discuss Trump's decision to halt Afghan immigration applications following the D.C. National Guardsmen attack and the upcoming Tennessee special election on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., accused House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., of siding with Democrats over Republicans in a heated public statement on Tuesday.

Stefanik, whom Johnson appointed as chairwoman of House GOP leadership earlier this year, claimed Johnson was blocking a provision in the annual defense policy bill that would allow Republicans to get revenge for being targeted in alleged instances of government weaponization.

Johnson called Stefanik's accusations "false" in comments to reporters on Tuesday morning and said he would support such a measure.

It's an explosive rift within the highest ranks of the House Republican Conference while the GOP wrestles with a razor-thin majority in the lower chamber.

MIKE JOHNSON, MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE CLASH IN HEATED PRIVATE GOP CALL OVER SHUTDOWN STRATEGY

The confrontation first began on Monday evening, when Stefanik posted on X, "Republicans have the House, Senate, and the White House, yet the deep state is alive and well with the Speaker getting rolled by House Dems attempting to block my provision to require Congressional disclosure when the FBI opens counterintelligence investigations into presidential and federal candidates seeking office."

She pointed to ex-FBI Director James Comey's 2017 testimony when Stefanik said he "admitted to not following proper notification procedures" when opening the investigation into whether the 2016 Trump campaign colluded with Russia.

The legislation is all the more important now, Stefanik added, with revelations that ex-Special Counsel Jack Smith seized phone records of some Republican lawmakers without their knowledge during his own probe of President Donald Trump.

Stefanik said she would vote against the annual defense bill, called the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), if the provision was not included.

The NDAA is responsible for setting national security and defense policies for the federal government every year. A concurring defense spending bill funds those policies.

Stefanik's threat is particularly notable coming from a member of the House Armed Services Committee, where the NDAA originates.

JOHNSON SAYS HE'S 'OPEN' TO CHANGING HOUSE CENSURE RULES AFTER WEEK OF POLITICAL DRAMA

She followed her post with a similar accusation on Tuesday morning, "I just walked out of a briefing on this issue this morning CONFIRMING everything I posted yesterday."

"That yes, in fact, the Speaker is blocking my provision to root out the illegal weaponization that led to Crossfire Hurricane, Arctic Frost, and more. He is siding with [Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.] against Trump Republicans to block this provision to protect the deep state," Stefanik continued.

"This is an easy one. This bill is [dead on arrival] unless this provision gets added in as it was passed out of committee," she said.

Johnson suggested he was blindsided by the attacks when asked during his weekly press conference on Tuesday.

"Well, all of that is false. I don't exactly know why Elise won't just call me. I texted her yesterday. She's upset. One of her provisions is not being made, I think, into the NDAA. I explained to her on a text message — as soon as I heard this yesterday, I was campaigning in Tennessee — and I wrote her, and I said, what are you talking about? This hasn't even made it to my level," Johnson said.

"The way regular order works is – and I think she should know this, we'll be talking about it, I'm sure today — the way this works is that, it has to go through committees of jurisdiction if it will be attached to the NDAA. And this provision that she's working on, I think is under the jurisdiction of judiciary."

Johnson said there had to be an agreement between the top Republican and Democrat on the committees of jurisdiction in both the House and Senate for a specific provision to make it into the NDAA.

"Well, in this case — I found out last night, this wasn't even on my radar — that apparently didn't happen," he said.

"It doesn't mean it can't become law or even that that is a final decision. But I sent my friend Elise a text last night and I said, 'Can you find out what the issue was, and I'll help you resolve it?' I support her provision. I mean, I would vote for it. I think it's smart, and I'm not sure exactly why it wasn't included. So I don't know why she's frustrated with me. I literally had nothing to do with it. But I'm happy to roll up my sleeves and help her."

            Pope Leo has said he believes the United States needs to find “another way” in handling the situation in Venezuela, warning against any military incursion and saying it would be better to pursue dialogue or apply economic pressure.
    


            “It seems there is the possibility that there be some activity, even an operation to invade Venezuelan territory,” Leo, who spent several years as a missionary and bishop in Peru, told reporters on board the papal plane returning to Rome from Beirut on Tuesday. “I truly believe that it is better to look for ways of dialogue, maybe pressure, including economic pressure, but looking another way to change, if that is what they want to do in the United States.”
    


            The first American pope's comments come at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and Venezuela, with Leo saying church leaders in the South American country were looking for “ways to calm the situation.”
    


            He noted that US President Donald Trump and his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolás Maduro had spoken on the phone and that because “the voices that come from the US change, with some frequency sometimes, one needs to see.”
    


            During an in-flight press conference covering a range of topics, Leo also called for Europe and North America to be “a little less fearful” when it comes to immigrants of different faiths. Asked about Catholics who see Islam as a “threat” to Christianity in Europe, Leo said he is aware of people's fears, but said they are often “generated by people who are against immigration and trying to keep out people who may be from another country, another religion, another race.”
    


            Instead, Leo said his visit to Turkey and Lebanon underlined that “dialogue and friendship between Muslims and Christians is possible” citing Lebanon as a country which teaches friendship between Christians and Muslims. He said the lessons from Lebanon need to be “heard in Europe or North America, that we should perhaps be a little less fearful and look for ways of promoting authentic dialogue and respect.”
    


            His comments on migration come less than a week after Trump said he was considering permanently banning immigration from what he called “third world countries.”

            The pope also stressed the importance of Europe in forging a peace plan for Ukraine, amid talks taking place between US envoys and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday. “It is clear that on one part the president of the United States thinks that a peace plan can be promoted that he would like to do and that at least in a first moment was without Europe, but the presence of Europe is important and that first plan was modified also because of what Europe was saying.”
    


            Leo also spoke for the first time about how he felt at the time of his election as pope earlier this year, revealing that “just a year or two ago” the 70-year-old had thought about retiring.
    


            “What was it like? I resigned myself to the fact when I saw how things were going that it could be a reality,” he said. “I took a deep breath, I said ‘here we go Lord you're in charge, you lead the way.'”
    


            He also said he hoped to visit Algeria soon to follow in the footsteps of the fourth century Saint Augustine, the founder of his religious order, and to promote a message of dialogue between the Christian and Muslim world.
    


            On May 8, 2025, the cardinals of the Catholic Church elected Cardinal Robert Prevost, the first US-born pope in the church's 2,000-year history. While he has adopted the same priorities as his predecessor, Leo has a more low-key, formal style, with some wondering how he will address the church's major challenges.
    


            Leo spent time with reporters on the way out to Turkey last week, talking about Wordle, wishing American journalists on board a happy Thanksgiving, and being handed pumpkin pies. He also took questions from the media on two occasions during the six-day-long trip.
    


            While some have remarked on his inscrutability, Leo cited a book, which he said would help understand him better. The book titled, “The Practice of the Presence of God” was written by “Brother Lawrence” a 17th century Carmelite lay brother, he said it is an account of someone who “simply gives his life to the Lord and allows the Lord to lead.”
    


            He said: “if you want to know something about me, that's been my spirituality for many years”, adding that it helped him while in Peru “during years of terrorism” and various different assignments.
    


            Leo's decision to hold a press conference on the way back from Lebanon, continues in the steps of his predecessors including Pope Francis who frequently made notable interventions during his in-flight press conferences.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses the D.C. National Guard ambush, broader concerns over Biden-era Afghan vetting and migration pauses from high-risk countries.

After an Afghan asylee allegedly shot two West Virginia National Guardsmen on Wednesday, President Donald Trump ordered U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow to commence a "full-scale, rigorous reexamination" of green-card holders from "countries of concern."

The directive highlights the legal avenues through which a green card — lawful permanent residence granted through an Adjustment of Status application — can be withdrawn, and those through which it cannot.

There are several major ways lawful permanent residency can be revoked.

Several immigration law firms — including Sedki and Rebecca Black — cite similar orders and descriptions on their sites, and related details appear across various federal webpages, but Fox News Digital did not find any single official source that consolidates them.

First, green-card holders can be placed in removal proceedings if they are convicted of certain crimes – including "aggravated felonies" such as murder, some serious sex and drug-trafficking offenses, as well as crimes involving moral turpitude like certain theft, fraud or violent-offense convictions, depending on the sentence and timing.

They can also lose their green cards over convictions connected to terrorism or espionage for foreign governments. Green-card holders also cannot vote in federal elections, and convictions connected to attempts to do so can also result in revocation of their residency status.

A second basis for withdrawal is evidence that the noncitizen obtained the green card through fraud or misrepresentation.

HOMELAND SECURITY TO SCAN MIGRANTS' SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS FOR ANTISEMITISM: 'NO ROOM FOR TERRORIST SYMPATHIZERS'

Examples include foreign nationals who used identity theft, lied on their applications, or omitted parts of their criminal history or prior contact with U.S. immigration authorities.

USCIS may also revisit Adjustment of Status applications for lawful permanent residents who became such through a marriage that ends in divorce within two years. The agency can revoke a green card if it is found the foreign national married a U.S. citizen strictly in order to achieve residency.

VETERANS GROUPS URGE TRUMP ADMIN TO CONTINUE AFGHAN ALLY SUPPORT PROGRAM AMID BUDGET CUT CONCERNS

Home address issues and questions arising out of where – including in which country – a green-card holder truly resides can also be grounds for revocation.

Lawful permanent residents must be just that: people residing permanently in the U.S. with a primary residence stateside.

Leaving the country for more than a year without obtaining a reentry permit can lead the feds to consider a green card abandoned. Changes of address within the U.S. must also be reported to USCIS.

While most people who would fall under the subsection have since died or would be in their 90s at the least, a Cold War provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) bars any noncitizen who, between March 1933 and May 1945, participated in or ordered persecutions under Germany's Nazi regime or in German-occupied territories.

Relatedly, any immigrant who has been affiliated with communism or any "totalitarian party" in another country, is also banned from holding a green card.

One avenue the Trump administration, however, may pursue as it commences a full-scale review of green-card holders from Afghanistan and other "countries of concern" is the final major way residency status may be questioned or revoked: what some firms describe as the public charge rule.

FEDERAL JUDGE IN MAJOR BLUE CITY BLOCKS KEY TRUMP MOVE ON REFUGEES: ‘NOT LIMITLESS'

According to various immigration law firms' websites, such residents relying too heavily on public assistance and government programs may find themselves in removal proceedings if they are "deemed a public charge" under the law – but with a key caveat.

Under the INA, simply receiving public benefits does not make a noncitizen deportable. They must have become a public charge within five years of admission "from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen since entry." This standard is rarely invoked.

Additionally, relevant to Trump's Afghan example, any noncitizen previously arrested or deported from the U.S., or removed as an "enemy" or at government expense in lieu of deportation, may not hold a green card.

'HE IS DELIVERING': TRUMP'S FIRST MONTH FLIPS SCRIPT ON RADICAL BIDEN-HARRIS BORDER POLICIES

Sections of the INA finalized in 1995 and 2025 also list other grounds of inadmissibility or deportability.

A noncitizen with a communicable disease of "public health significance" can be denied status, as can those with a "mental disorder" posing a threat, or individuals deemed "drug addicts." Polygamy is also a disqualifying factor.

TRUMP'S BORDER GROUND GAME IS OFF TO A FAST START. TO GUARANTEE CHANGE CONGRESS MUST DO 3 THINGS

While many of the Afghan refugees reportedly came with little to no documentation at the time of the mass withdrawal from Kabul, the INA also prescribes that foreign nationals who were never qualified to obtain full citizenship for various reasons are also ineligible for lawful permanent residence.

The administration could, potentially, investigate whether any of the largely unvetted noncitizens have disqualifying history and enforce that subsection of the INA against them.

While former President Joe Biden's Operation Welcoming Heroes was an official mission, 8 USC Sec 1182(a) 5(d) also lays out how "any alien who is a stowaway is excludable." That definition would likely be up to legal interpretation, as the current administration signals a no-holds barred audit of current green-card holders.

UP TO 1M MIGRANTS WHO USED BIDEN'S CBP ONE APP ORDERED TO DEPORT BY TRUMP ADMIN

Federal law states that immigration officers must state the negative determination to the green-card holder, and list the specific provision under the law that their disqualification or rescission falls under.

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House, DOJ, DHS and officials at USCIS for comment and clarification on any of the major grounds collected for a green card's withdrawal.

In comments to CBS News, Edlow said his agency has followed the president's order and "halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible. The safety of the American people always comes first." 

Trump quoted the INA inasmuch as: "Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate."

Jurors hear evidence and witness testimonies in the murder trial of Brian Walshe, who has been charged with killing his wife in 2023.

Brian Walshe, the 50-year-old Massachusetts man accused of killing his wife after uncovering an affair between her and a friend in Washington, D.C., returns to court Tuesday for the second day of his murder trial.

Walshe's defense attorney, Larry Tipton, said during his opening statement Monday that Walshe found his wife dead in her bed but did not kill her. Tipton said evidence would show a "sudden, unexplained death" and that such a thing "happens." He denied the prosecution's allegation that his client was aware of Ana Walshe's suspected affair.

Walshe is accused of killing Ana, dismembering her and hiding her body — after searching the internet for information about the man she was seeing behind his back.

"The defense can argue that the search shows the awareness of a name, not that he knew about a romantic relationship," said Randolph Rice, a Maryland attorney and legal analyst who is following the case. "That distinction matters because without clear knowledge of an affair, the state's motive theory gets a lot weaker."

Walshe already pleaded guilty to lesser charges of misleading police and unlawful conveyance of human remains.

Cohasset Police Sgt. Harrison Schmidt will come back to the stand after prosecutors said they intend to continue questioning him and also to play about 40 minutes of additional excerpts from his interviews with Walshe prior to the defendant's arrest. 

Prosecutors played more than an hour of similar recordings Monday, in which Walshe spoke calmly with detectives with sporadic interruptions from his three children as their mother was unaccounted for in early January 2023.

"I would never do anything to my wife," he told Schmidt at one point, after Ana's death. "I wanted to spend the rest of my life with my wife. I'm still going to."

Massachusetts State Trooper Nicholas Guarino, an expert on digital forensics, is expected to take the stand next and discuss Walshe's alleged Google searches, which included the name of the man involved in an affair with Ana, 39, and for information on how to dispose of human remains.

Guarino testified earlier this year in another high-profile Massachusetts murder trial, reading text messages sent between Karen Read and John O'Keefe. Read was acquitted of all homicide-related charges in the death of her former boyfriend, O'Keefe, and convicted of drunken driving.

Prosecutors have alleged two possible motives in the case. 

The first is that Walshe allegedly uncovered an affair between his wife and a Washington, D.C., realtor, who is expected to take the witness stand Thursday.

The other is that Walshe allegedly believed that if his wife was out of the picture, and he was the only caretaker for their three children, he could have a chance of avoiding prison in connection with a federal art fraud conviction.

            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is recommending that the Trump administration's travel ban list include between 30 to 32 countries, marking an increase from the current list of 19 countries, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            Nationals of countries on the travel ban list face restrictions on travel to the United States. The source said the list could continue to expand based on ongoing assessments, but it is unclear which countries are being added to the list — and when they'll be announced.
    


            The recommendation to the White House comes on the heels of the shooting in Washington, DC, that killed one National Guard member and critically wounded another.
    


            The shooting suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who previously worked with the US in Afghanistan, resettling in Washington state under the Biden administration and then being granted asylum under the Trump administration.
    


            Noem said Monday that, following a meeting with President Donald Trump, she recommended a “full travel ban” on “every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”
    


            The current list of 19 countries with full or partial restrictions include Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.
    


            Trump has previously said that some countries had “deficient” screening for passports and other public documents or have historically refused to take back their own citizens.
    


            The Trump administration has also ramped up its immigration crackdown, citing the shooting in Washington, DC. Senior Trump administration officials have accused the Biden administration of insufficiently vetting the suspect and argued the current immigration system needs to be overhauled.
    


            Last week, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that it will reexamine all green cards issued to people from the 19 countries currently facing full or partial travel restrictions.
    


            The agency's director, Joe Edlow, also announced updated guidance that authorizes USCIS officers “to consider country-specific factors as significant negative factors when reviewing immigration requests.”
    


            The same day, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, said the administration was also reviewing all asylum cases that were approved under former President Joe Biden.
    


            A day later, Edlow announced the US was pausing all asylum decisions “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”
    


            Trump has also threatened to “permanently pause” migration from what he called “third-world countries,” without specifying which countries he was referring to — a move Noem defended on Sunday.

President Donald Trump is hosting a Cabinet meeting, the day after the administration insists that a secondary strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea in a September U.S. military operation was lawful.

The White House said Monday that Navy Vice Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley ordered the second strike and was “within his authority and the law.” The military operation has come under bipartisan scrutiny from lawmakers after The Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had issued a verbal order to “kill everybody” on the boat.

Legal experts say the U.S. military would have committed a crime if survivors were killed. Trump defended Hegseth on Sunday. “Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump said. “And I believe him.” Bradley is expected to provide a classified briefing Thursday to lawmakers overseeing the military.

Other stories we're following:








Trump called affordability — a key issue propelling Democrats to victory in last month's elections — a “con job,” but some of his cabinet secretaries seem to see the issue as a real one for the country.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins referenced it Tuesday as a lingering issue for American farmers. She said the economic “destruction” over which Biden presided increased costs for the nation's farmers, calling them “massive numbers that will take some time to get out from under.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also called affordability a “crisis.” And Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner referenced affordability in the context of hundreds of thousands of Americans he said were able to become first-time homebuyers recently.

Vice President JD Vance sought to bring the issue back around to Trump's viewpoint, acknowledging affordability as a crisis Democrats created.

Brooke Rollins told Trump during the Cabinet meeting that he's been opening overseas markets for U.S. farmers to help them become less reliant on government assistance.

But she said, “we do have a bridge payment we'll be announcing with you next week.”

Rollins didn't say how much the payment will be or which farmers will get assistance.

The president said Tuesday that his administration will embark on a reconstruction of Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia.

“It should be a great airport, and it's not a good airport at all. It's a terrible airport,” Trump said during his Cabinet meeting.

Dulles is one of the three Washington-area airports and its quality and utility is a hotly-debated topic among Washingtonians. The real estate mogul-turned-president said it was “incorrectly designed,” even as he praised Eero Saarinen, the Finnish-American architect who designed its main terminal.

“We're gonna make that into something really spectacular. We have an amazing plan for it,” Trump said.

One of the “people movers” that ferry travelers between Dulles concourses crashed in November. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said his agency will announce a request for bids later Tuesday to repair the “mobile lounges.”

Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner announced his bid for reelection on Tuesday, launching what will be a key campaign in a narrowly divided Senate.

The Virginia senator's campaign announcement says he's running to rein in America's economic crisis, particularly regarding the impact of artificial intelligence on job displacement.

“We need a vision to chart a new path and effective leadership to get it done,” Warner said.

Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate. According to the Cook Political Report, Warner represents a solidly Democratic seat.

The nameplate in front of the defense secretary, visible in video of the meeting, mistakenly includes an extra s.

Trump bragged about his move to rename the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of War. Such a change requires an act of Congress that hasn't occurred.

Trump called on Hegseth to speak first as each Cabinet member gave brief presentations.

Neither Trump nor Hegseth mentioned the nameplate misspelling, but online posters were quick to point it out.

Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom died and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe remains hospitalized following the pre-Thanksgiving shooting in Washington. “I want to pay my deepest respects” to Wolfe and to Beckstrom, Trump said.

The president said he spoke with the parents of both National Guard members, and that Wolfe's mother insisted her son will recover.

“No doctor thought that,” Trump said. “It would be a miracle” if Wolfe lives.

Seated once again at Trump's left, Hegseth said the Department of Defense is getting back to its basics, which he said includes “lethality.”

Hegseth's presence in the Cabinet Room is attracting extra attention as the Pentagon faces bipartisan scrutiny for a follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat in September. The Washington Post first reported that Hegseth issued a verbal order for the second strike that killed survivors on the boat.

Trump did not mention the strikes during his lengthy intro.

The White House said Monday that a Navy admiral acted “within his authority and the law” when he ordered the second strike. Lawmakers have announced congressional reviews of the U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs.

Navy Vice Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, who White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said ordered the second strike, is expected to provide a classified briefing Thursday to lawmakers overseeing the military. “We always have the back of our commanders,” Hegseth said. 

Trump raised the subject of his White House renovation projects as he spoke during what he said is the year's final Cabinet meeting.

Trucks, cranes, excavators and other equipment have taken over the plot where the East Wing once stood.

“Every time I hear them, I love the sound,” Trump said, jokingly adding that he wouldn't say his wife, Melania Trump, is as “thrilled” as he is by the noise.

Trump said the work continues well into the night and that when the first lady asks for it to stop, he responds with, “Sorry, darling. That's progress.”

Leo XVI has called for the United States to pursue dialogue and even economic pressure on Venezuela to achieve its goals, rather than threats of military action.

History's first American pope told reporters aboard the papal plane returning from Lebanon that the Venezuelan bishops conference and the Vatican Embassy in Caracas have been trying to calm the situation and look out for the plight of ordinary Venezuelans.

“The voices coming from the United States change, with a certain frequency at times,” he said. “On the one hand it seems there was telephone conversation between the two presidents, on the other there's this danger, this possibility of an activity, an operation including invading the territory of Venezuela.”

“I believe it's better to look for ways of dialogue, perhaps pressure — including economic pressure — but looking for other ways to change, if that's what the United States wants to do.”

Since his return to office, Trump said Tuesday that global respect for the United States has gone up, taking a moment to swipe at former Democratic President Joe Biden for putting the country in “great danger.”

Trump noted the ongoing diplomatic efforts in which U.S. officials have been speaking with Ukrainian and Russian counterparts in efforts to end that war. 

A U.S. delegation was in Moscow Tuesday sitting down with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Sunday, U.S. and Ukrainian officials completed roughly four hours of talks in Florida.

The 79-year-old president slipped into the third person as he criticized a recent New York Times report on his schedule and stamina. He had complained about the story on social media days ago and insulted the looks of the reporter. Now he's used his Cabinet meeting to continue to air his grievances and insist he's in great shape.

“You people are crazy,” Trump said, addressing reporters in the room. “I'll let you know if there's something wrong.”

Trump said at his Cabinet meeting that next year he'll be “giving back refunds out of the tariffs because we've taken in literally trillions dollars.”

It's not clear how that would work or if Trump could afford to do so without worsening the national debt, which he claims his tariffs will also cut.

The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that so far this year the U.S. government has collected $258.1 billion in tariffs. This revenue from taxes on imports is meaningfully higher than $90 billion collected at this point last year. But it's not trillions, and it's not clear how Trump could refund the taxes he imposed unilaterally by declaring an economic emergency. 

The annual budget shortfall for the last fiscal year was $1.8 trillion, significantly higher than Trump's tariff revenues.

Still, Trump said he's banking on tariffs supplanting income taxes, so much so that “at some point in the not too distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay.”

Rep. Ted Lieu, vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said the Department of Justice must conduct an investigation into a second strike of a vessel accused of trafficking drugs off the coast of Venezuela.

Lieu, who served in the United States Air Force JAG corps, said killing shipwreck survivors is a war crime.

He said the DOJ's investigation should also include a review of Hegseth's actions as defense secretary.

“If the Trump administration does not hold the people accountable, I guarantee you a future administration will do so because there is no statute of limitations for war crimes,” Lieu said.

The president said Tuesday that members of his party are on the same page when it comes to negotiations over health care, as he repeated his frequent criticisms of the Affordable Care Act.

But that's in contrast with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has declined to say whether he will allow a vote on a health care bill. A health care proposal recently circulated by the White House is running into the reality of Republican divisions on the issue.

The tentative proposal would extend expiring ACA subsidies for two years while adjusting eligibility requirements for recipients. The plan has so far been met with a stony silence on Capitol Hill as Republicans debate among themselves whether to overhaul the law, tweak it or simply let the subsidies expire.

It's no secret that Trump is counting the days until Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's term expires in May.

“We'll be announcing somebody, probably early next year, for the new chairman of the Fed,” Trump said at Tuesday's cabinet meeting.

He's in the process of vetting final candidates. Those likely include Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, and Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor. 

Trump continues to joke that he wants Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to lead the U.S. central bank, but he says Bessent has turned him down because he has “the greatest job.”

The Defense secretary is sitting in his usual seat, at Trump's left. His presence in the Cabinet Room is attracting extra attention as the Pentagon faces bipartisan scrutiny for a second, follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea in a September.

The GOP leader said as far as he can tell it was Admiral Bradley's decision to strike the boat a second time.

“He made that call,” Johnson said at his weekly press conference. “I don't know what went into the Admiral's decision,” he added, but he said, the incident is “something Congress will look at.”

Johnson demurred when asked if the video tape should be made available for review.

“I don't know how much of that tape should be released, because I'm not sure how much is sensitive with regard to national security,” he said.

The president has opened what he says is the final meeting of his Cabinet for 2025.

Trump has begun by talking about what he says is a historic $18 trillion in investments in the United States, citing money spent in the country from other nations, as well as what he said was record spending on Black Friday.

Musician Sabrina Carpenter and the publisher of the beloved children's character Franklin the Turtle are disavowing the Trump administration's use of their music and imagery to support its agenda.

Responding to the use of her song “Juno” in a video montage depicting ICE raids, Carpenter tweeted Tuesday: “this video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”

And on Monday, “Franklin the Turtle” publisher Kids Can Press condemned Hegseth's post on X of a manipulated image showing Franklin aiming a bazooka at boats.

“We strongly condemn any denigrating, violent, or unauthorized use of Franklin's name or image, which directly contradicts these values,” the publisher said in a tweet. 

Wilson began with attacks on Democratic lawmakers and mainstream media.

She also maintained the Trump administration's assertions that the U.S. military's attacks on alleged drug boats off the Venezuela coast are “lawful.” At least 83 people have been killed in at least 21 strikes in a campaign now facing House and Senate scrutiny. 

Wilson also rebuked a Washington Post story that reported that the U.S. military killed two survivors of an initial boat attack on Sept. 2. Wilson maintained that the second strike was ordered by Adm. Frank Bradley, and that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “100%" agrees with both strikes. 

“As the White House confirmed yesterday, the decision to strike the narco-terrorist vessel was made by Admiral Bradley, operating under clear and long standing authorities to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States was eliminated,” Wilson said.

Jeff Landry said he received that commitment from Trump himself.

“He said, ‘Don't worry Jeff, we'll have them there in two weeks,'” Landry said, recounting a Monday morning phone call with Trump. 

The governor, who spoke with reporters during an event honoring victims of the New Year's Day Bourbon Street attack, provided no additional details on the deployment.

Landry requested in September that the federal government send 1,000 guard troops, citing concerns about crime in some of Louisiana's most populous cities.

It's a district that Trump won by 22 percentage points in 2024, but House Speaker Mike Johnson joined other Republicans in tamping down expectations ahead of Tuesday's U.S. House special election in Tennessee.

“Special elections are strange animals and anything can happen,” Johnson said. “And when you're in a deep red district, sometimes people assume that the Republican, the conservative will win. And you cannot assume that.”

Johnson said at his Tuesday press conference that he spent nearly 10 hours in the district the day before, holding nearly a dozen events. Winning the race is both crucial for the GOP's narrow majority and viewed as a potential barometer ahead of next year's midterms.

Speaker Mike Johnson says “we didn't commit to that” when asked whether House Republicans would pursue a short-term extension of health care subsidies before they soon expire.

Johnson's comment comes as he spoke to reporters Tuesday. Some of the Republicans in key swing districts have been calling for a short-term extension to prevent premiums from soaring next year for thousands of their constituents. But time is running short as lawmakers wrap up their work before the holiday break.

Johnson said only a small percentage of Americans are affected by the subsidy increases kicking in next year for those on Affordable Care Act exchanges.

“All of this hullabaloo is over 7%. Now, every American, 100% of Americans need their health care costs to come down. Republicans have ideas to do that. Now, what I've got to do is build consensus deliberately around the best ideas.”

Most of the Pentagon's press corps turned in their access badges rather than submit to new rules restricting what they can report.

Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson is holding Tuesday's event with “invited press only” able to ask any questions. It's also being broadcast on the Pentagon's website, among other places.

The Pentagon's last on-camera press briefing was in June after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. This briefing comes amid increasing scrutiny of U.S. military strikes against alleged drug boats off Venezuela and reports that survivors of one attack were killed in what may have been a criminal act.

Several conservative news outlets and internet influencers agreed to the new press policy. Virtually all other media organizations declined to go along over concerns it will restrict them to reporting what Hegseth approves.

U.S.-operated flights returning deported migrants to Venezuela will continue despite Trump's assertion that the airspace of the South American country should be viewed as closed. 

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government announced Tuesday that the twice-weekly flights will go on Wednesday following a request from the Trump administration, reversing its Saturday announcement that U.S. immigration authorities had unilaterally suspended the flights.

More than 13,000 migrants have been deported to Venezuela this year on dozens of chartered flights after Maduro, under pressure from the White House, did away with his long-standing policy of not accepting deportees from the U.S. The flights have continued despite U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean and off Venezuela's Caribbean coast.

The president on social media called GOP candidate Matt Van Epps “phenomenal” and a “MAGA Warrior” who “cherishes Christianity and Country Music.”

Trump has repeatedly criticized the Democratic candidate, state Rep. Aftyn Behn, for comments she made about Nashville during a 2020 podcast in which she said “I hate country music.”

This combination image shows Aftyn Behn, left, Nov. 13, 2025, Nashville, Tenn. and Matt Van Epps, Nov. 12, 2025, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/George Walker IV, file)



Behn, who represents Tennessee's biggest city, which is considered the home of country music, said the GOP is trying claim she hates Nashville, and she's “not going to take the bait.”

“I've cried no less than 10 times in the Country Music Hall of Fame — the girl that just goes to the Ryman to hang out” she posted Nov. 20 in a Facebook video. “They're panicking because we're close to winning. Eyes on the prize, y'all. Let's go.”

A faith-based pregnancy center will ask the justices on Tuesday to block a state investigation into whether it misled people to discourage abortions.

The facilities often known as “crisis pregnancy centers” have been on the rise since the Supreme Court's conservative majority overturned abortion as a nationwide right in 2022. Most Republican-controlled states have been enforcing bans or restrictions on abortion, and some have steered tax dollars to the centers, which generally provide prenatal care and encourage women to carry pregnancies to term. 

Many Democratic-aligned states have sought to protect abortion access and some have investigated whether pregnancy centers mislead women into thinking they offer abortions. New Jersey's attorney general Matthew Platkin sent a subpoena to First Choice Women's Resource Centers for donor information. First Choice argues the investigation is baseless and the demand for donor lists threatens its First Amendment rights.

Brian Finucane, now a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group, said the U.S. is not in an armed conflict with drug cartels, and “the term for a premeditated killing outside of armed conflict is murder.

“Murder on the high seas is a crime,” he said. “Conspiracy to commit murder outside of the United States is a crime. And under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 118 makes murder an offense.”

The Pentagon's own manual on the laws of war describes a scenario similar to the Sept. 2 boat strike when discussing when service members should refuse to comply with unlawful orders: “For example,” the manual says, “orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal.”

Juan Orlando Hernández was serving a 45 year sentence for helping drug traffickers move some 400 tons of cocaine to the United States. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons confirmed Tuesday that he was released from a prison in Hazelton, West Virginia following a pardon from Trump.

“After almost four years of pain, of waiting and difficult challenges, my husband Juan Orlando Hernández RETURNED to being a free man, thanks to the presidential pardon granted by President Donald Trump,” his wife Ana García posted Tuesday.

Asked why he did it, Trump said Sunday that people in Honduras told him Hernández had been falsely accused in “a Biden administration set-up.”

The pardon injected a new element into Honduras' presidential election, possibly helping the candidate from Hernández' right-wing National Party as the vote count proceeded Tuesday.

Michael Schmitt, a former Air Force lawyer and professor emeritus at the U.S. Naval War College, said it doesn't matter whether the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels, as the Trump administration asserts — he says such a fatal second strike would have violated both peacetime laws and those governing armed conflict.

“I can't imagine anyone, no matter what the circumstance, believing it is appropriate to kill people who are clinging to a boat in the water,” said Schmitt. 

“It has been clear for well over a century that you may not declare what's called ‘no quarter' — take no survivors, kill everyone,” he said.

On Monday, Vox announced the launch of a major, multi-year editorial project exploring what it will take for the United States to restore its capacity to build — from new energy solutions, to upgrading transportation systems, to dramatically expanding the nation's housing supply.

The project stems from a clear diagnosis: America urgently needs to build — fast — and it needs to grow. Through ambitious, solutions-focused journalism, Vox will examine the policy, political, and practical challenges that shape the country's ability to construct the infrastructure and systems required for the 21st century. Coverage will delve into ideas and innovations that could unlock progress, including expanding electricity supply and modernizing the grid, improving and accelerating transportation projects, and growing housing availability to combat a decades-long shortage.

Vox received a grant from Arnold Ventures to support this project, though Vox retains full editorial control over all content produced as part of the project.

“Vox's explanatory and solutions-focused journalism has been at the forefront of some of the most consequential policy discussions of the last decade,” said executive editor Elbert Ventura. “This generous grant from Arnold Ventures will allow us to dig into some of the most pressing questions in policy, surface undercovered ideas, and inform the national conversation in this crucial moment in our politics.”

The initiative spans two major editorial packages, podcast series, live events, and a forthcoming newsletter product. Reporting and analysis will come from Vox's newsroom, as well as contributions from a diverse roster of freelance writers. The project aims to serve as a resource for lawmakers, government officials, policy thinkers, scholars, journalists, and others shaping the national conversation around America's capacity to build. But it also seeks to bring smart policy thinking and under-examined ideas to the wider public.

The first editorial package, The Case for Growth, is live today, with additional stories rolling out over the next month. This series will explore why the US turned away from a growth-oriented mindset and why doubling back down on growth — in energy solutions; in productivity; in technology; and ultimately, in the economy — is the only way out of a zero-sum politics that has paralyzed the country.

The second package, How They Built It, will debut in 2026. This case-study series will examine what the United States can learn from countries that have successfully built infrastructure faster, cleaner, and more affordably — and what it would take to apply those lessons at home.

The project will also include a Today, Explained podcast miniseries; an interview series on The Gray Area; a new newsletter focused on infrastructure and building policy launching in 2026; and a series of salon-style live events exploring these topics, taking place in 2026 and 2027.

            Andrew Wolfe, the 24-year-old National Guard member who was injured in an ambush-style shooting in Washington, DC, last Wednesday, remains in serious condition but has shown “positive” signs of recovery, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said.
    


            “My biggest message is Andrew is still fighting for his life,” Morrisey said at a news conference on Monday.
    


            The governor said his office was told that when a nurse asked Wolfe to give a thumbs up if he could hear, “he did respond.”
    


            “And we were told that he also wiggled his toes, so we take that as a positive sign,” Morrisey added. Wolfe's parents have asked for continued prayers as their son fights to recover, he said.
    


Wolfe, a US Air Force staff sergeant, was shot and injured while deployed to Washington, DC, as part of the Trump administration's efforts to reduce crime. A fellow West Virginia National Guard member, Sarah Beckstrom, was also shot in the attack. The 20-year-old died Thursday from her injuries.
    


            Morrisey remembered Beckstrom as “an amazing woman who lifted up people.”
    


            “She is someone who is going to be remembered for a very, very long time, and she had her life tragically cut short,” the governor added.
    


            The suspect in the shooting has been identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who worked with the CIA for over a decade in Afghanistan before the US military withdrew from the country.
    


            Lankanwal came to the United States in 2021 as part of Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden administration-era program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of vulnerable Afghans — many of whom worked alongside US troops and diplomats — after the American withdrawal. He applied for asylum in 2024, and it was granted earlier this year under the Trump administration.
    


            The suspect faces at least one first-degree murder charge, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro, told Fox News on Friday, adding, “There are certainly many more charges to come.”
    


            Lakanwal was wounded during the shooting and taken to the hospital, authorities said. His condition is unknown, but he has not had his first court appearance.
    


            At Monday's news conference, Morrisey emphasized that guard members volunteered to be deployed to the nation's capital and said 170 members of the state's National Guard remain in Washington, DC, to support local law enforcement.
    


            He said his office does “not have a specific date in mind” for when those troops will return to West Virginia.
    


            Morrisey declined to directly address the source of conflicting statements his office released shortly after the shooting about the condition of the two injured guard members. Initially, a statement from Morrisey's office indicated that both guard members had been killed, but it was later corrected.
    


            “I could tell you that the process is that we try to get as much information as we can, accurate information, from the most credible sources,” Morrisey said. “In this case, that information was incorrect and then within 20 minutes we changed it.”
    


            Shortly after the shooting, the Trump administration filed an emergency motion to keep the National Guard in Washington, DC, after a judge ruled that President Donald Trump's deployment of the guard was unlawful.
    


            City officials had argued in a lawsuit against the troops' deployment, saying it undermined the city's autonomy and was unnecessary.
    


            Trump also asked for 500 more National Guard troops to be deployed to the nation's capital.

Fox News senior correspondent Claudia Cowan reports from California as four people, including three children, are killed and 11 others wounded in a mass shooting at a Stockton birthday party.

A manhunt is still underway for a suspect in a Stockton, California, mass shooting that left four people dead this weekend, including three children, with police saying there likely were multiple shooters.

The FBI has offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of a suspect. The victims in Saturday's shooting were 8, 9, 14 and 21 years old. They were attending a birthday party for a 2-year-old, and attendees said the group was gathering around the cake when the gunshots began.

"As we got ready to start cutting her cake, everyone started gathering around and cutting the cake and all we heard were gunshots. Everybody just dove to the ground. It was just unexpected. I don't know what happened. I'm just so shocked and lost and speechless," said Patrice Williams, who organized the party for her daughter.

"I just want to say I'm sorry to all the mothers out there that lost their kids at my birthday party," she added.

Eleven people were injured in the attack, in addition to the four fatalities. Williams said that among those injured were her sister, a cousin and three of her friends.

Sheriff Patrick Withrow of the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office confirmed to the press on Monday that there "appears to be multiple shooters," but authorities have not publicly identified any suspects.

"They deserve to be in jail. They deserve to go to hell," Williams said. "I'm sorry, but I just ... it's not respectable. It's a kids' party."

A University of Oklahoma student who received a zero out of 25 on an assignment regarding gender norms says she was targeted for her Christian beliefs, citing a scathing response from the teacher's assistant who doled out the grade.

A University of Oklahoma student who received a zero out of 25 on an assignment regarding gender norms says she was targeted for her Christian beliefs, citing a scathing response from the teacher's assistant who doled out the grade.

Samantha Fulnecky is a junior pre-med student at the Sooner State's flagship university.

"I was asked to read an article and give my opinion on the article, and the article was about gender binary and mental health and gender stereotypes, specifically in children, because it's a lifespan development class," Fulnecky told Fox News Digital. "So I was asked to give my opinion and my reaction to the paper."

Fulnecky and her classmates were tasked with writing a response to a scholarly article titled "Relations Among Gender Typicality, Peer Relations, and Mental Health During Early Adolescence," summarizing results of a study about gender norms among middle schoolers and the social ramifications children may face for not conforming to gender norms.

Students were asked to provide a "thoughtful discussion of some aspect of the article." The assignment provided eight suggestions for how to respond, including, "An application of the study or results to your own experiences," "Your own thoughts about how development proceeds in the domain being researched in the article" and whether the student thought the topic was worthy of further study.

"So I did this assignment the same as I would any other in that class, gave my opinion on gender binary and gender stereotypes and that, naturally my views are from the Bible and my Christian kind of worldview," she said. "And so that's what I wrote about and I didn't think anything of it." 

Fulnecky, citing her Christian beliefs, responded that traditional gender roles should be reinforced, not degraded.

"The article discussed peers using teasing as a way to enforce gender norms. I do not necessarily see this as a problem. God made male and female and made us differently from each other on purpose and for a purpose," Fulnecky wrote in her essay. "God is very intentional with what He makes, and I believe trying to change that would only do more harm."

"Gender roles and tendencies should not be considered 'stereotypes,'" her essay continued. "Women naturally want to do womanly things because God created us with those womanly desires in our hearts. The same goes for men. God created men in the image of His courage and strength, and He created women in the image of His beauty. He intentionally created women differently than men and we should live our lives with that in mind."

Later in her essay, she denounced peers who conform to popular discourse on gender so they "do not step on people's toes," adding that she thinks it is "cowardly and insincere" of those who do.

The essay refers to Genesis, the first book of the Bible, in which God created men and women, and says that women are intended to be men's helpers. She defined the Hebrew translation of "helper" — "ezer kenegdo" — as "helper equal to [man]," making the point that God did not make women subordinate to men.

"Society [is] pushing the lie that there are multiple genders and everyone should be whatever they want to be is demonic and severely harms American youth," the essay continued. "I do not want kids to be teased or bullied in school. However, pushing the lie that everyone has their own truth and everyone can do whatever they want and be whoever they want is not biblical whatsoever."

"Overall, reading articles such as this one encourage me to one day raise my children knowing that they have a Heavenly Father who loves them and cherishes them deeply and that having their identity firmly rooted in who He is will give them the satisfaction and acceptance that the world can never provide for them," the essay concludes.

RUTGERS PROFESSOR ALLEGEDLY SHOWS CLASS SLIDES ABOUT ‘GIRL'S PENISES,' 'GENDER UNICORN'

The grading rubric for the assignment indicates three criteria.

"Does the paper show a clear tie-in to the assigned article?" is the first, worth up to 10 out of the assignment's 25 total points.

"Does the paper present a thoughtful reaction or response to the article, rather than a summary?" is the second, also worth up to 10 points.

"Is the paper clearly written?" is the last criterion, worth up to five points.

The paper was graded by graduate teaching assistant Mel Curth, who uses she/they pronouns. 

The teaching assistant gave Fulnecky a zero out of 25, along with an earful about "empathy" and evidence.

"And so then, about a week later, I received a zero on it from the teaching assistant, and he left submission comments saying that my work was offensive, that I need more empathy in my writing, things like if I'm going to argue against the consensus of every medical field. In every medical association in the United States, then I need empirical evidence to back that," she said.

Curth's response insisted that the grade had nothing to do with Fulnecky's beliefs, but criticized the essay for lacking empirical evidence, which was not mentioned as a requirement in the grading rubric. Curth also described the paper as "offensive."

"Please note that I am not deducting points because you have certain beliefs, but instead I am deducting point [sic] for you posting a reaction paper that does not answer the questions for this assignment, contradicts itself, heavily uses personal ideology over empirical evidence in a scientific class, and is at times offensive," Curth's response said.

Curth said that the concept of only two sexes is not backed by science.

"You may personally disagree with this, but that doesn't change the fact that every major psychological, medical, pediatric, and psychiatric association in the United States acknowledges that, biologically and psychologically, sex and gender is neither binary nor fixed," Curth said.

The teaching assistant also found Fulnecky's use of the word "demonic" to describe the idea of sex and gender on a spectrum "highly offensive."

"Additionally, to call an entire group of people 'demonic' is highly offensive, especially a minoritized population," Curth said.

"I definitely think that I was being punished for what I believe because I very clearly stated in my essay in my response to the article, I very clearly stated my beliefs and stated what — not just my beliefs — but what the Bible and what God says about gender and about those roles," Fulnecky said.

Fulnecky told Fox News Digital that when she challenged Curth on the grade, noting that the assignment directed her to provide her own subjective opinion on the article, the teaching assistant doubled down on the zero grade.

Fulnecky then escalated to the school's administration.

The university released a statement on social media on Sunday after Fulnecky's story went viral on social media.

"The University of Oklahoma takes seriously concerns involving First Amendment rights, certainly including religious freedoms," the statement said. "Upon receiving notice from the student on the grading of an assignment, the University immediately began a full review of the situation and has acted swiftly to address the matter."

The school said it "acted immediately to address the academic issue raised by the student. College leaders contacted her on the day her letter was received and have maintained regular communication throughout the process."

"As previously stated, a formal grade appeals process was conducted," the statement said. "The process resulted in steps to ensure no academic harm to the student from the graded assignments."

The university also announced that Curth has been placed on administrative leave.

"The graduate student instructor has been placed on administrative leave pending the finalization of this process," said the statement. "To ensure fairness in the process, a full-time professor is serving as the course instructor for the remainder of the semester."

Fulnecky, who said she doesn't believe conservative opinions are well-tolerated at the school, disagreed with Oklahoma's characterization of its own response, and said she found out about the action taken by the school from the social media post.

"So, the university is claiming that they've been in communication with me and that they gave me some sense of assurance that they wouldn't let this happen again," she said. "But in reality, I had no idea. I didn't think they were going to do anything about the situation. And I honestly don't think they would have if it hadn't blown up on social media the way it did. I really was shocked to see that the university put out a statement about that saying that they have handled everything perfectly and trying to cover their tracks because they wouldn't have done that or even acted like they cared if it hadn't blown up like it did."

Ryan Walters is the former Oklahoma superintendent of public instruction, who now runs the Teacher Freedom Alliance.

"Higher Ed. and K-12 schools, under the thumb of teachers unions, have infected an entire generation with their woke anti-Christian bias," he told Fox News Digital.

"Samantha Fulnecky is an American hero," he said. "She stood firm in her faith despite the radical attacks from the Marxist professors at the University of Oklahoma. The OU staff involved should be immediately fired and OU should not be receiving taxpayer dollars if they continue their assaults on faith. The war on Christianity is real, and we will not be silenced."

Fulnecky told Fox News Digital that she has received messages of encouragement and admiration from fellow students for standing up for her beliefs, but has also received hateful messages online.

She encouraged other students to stand up for what they believe.

"It can be pretty scary, but Jesus is always worth standing up for, and I just encourage those people that are dealing with something similar to push back against that kind of behavior and really fight for your university to change, because if we don't speak up about it, they're not gonna do anything to change it."

"I mean, I would rather have my integrity and give my true opinion and get a zero on an assignment than have to lie about what I really believe," she said.

As for her message to Curth, Fulnecky said God loves the teaching assistant despite the grade.

"I think I would just say that God loves him and that I am saddened that they're offended by the truth of the gospel and the truth that I wrote about in my assignment, and it saddens me to see that that offends them and upsets them the way it did."

Neither Curth nor the University of Oklahoma returned requests for comment.

﻿Giving away your money can feel great, if you do it right.

As the writer of an ethical advice column, I get a lot of questions from people who really want to do good in the world but are running into problems.

They want to know how to give charity — and how to do it optimally. They want to know if they should be pressuring their parents to donate more. They want to know if there's such a thing as helping too much or too little. And they want to know about ways of doing good that aren't about giving money at all.

So, in honor of Giving Tuesday, I've combed through all the advice I've given over the past year and created this cheat sheet for you. It's packed with my top tips, as well as my favorite quotes about the philosophy of doing good.

I grew up in a family on welfare. We always had housing and enough to eat, but we couldn't afford frills. I put every penny I got straight into a savings account, and my child-brain whined with anxiety when I saw my dad occasionally donate to others (what if we need that money?).

As an adult, I was lucky to get jobs that paid decently. But ,I kept grappling with money dysmorphia — feeling nervous about money even after becoming financially stable.



So, believe me when I say, I understand that giving away your money can be scary.

Here's what I did: I started small. I gave $10 here, $50 there, until, eventually, I was donating thousands of dollars each year. It helped that rigorous charity evaluators had come on the scene, so I could feel confident that certain nonprofits would put my money to good use. And it helped to learn that even a modest donation can do serious good. For just $94, say, you can keep a child from starving.

To my surprise, my initial fear ended up giving way to a wild, leaping joy. Giving felt so good, not only because I knew it was helping others, but because it reminded my brain that I'm not a solitary, atomized being; I'm connected to everyone else. As weird as it may sound, Giving Tuesday actually became one of my favorite days of the year.

The British philosopher Derek Parfit once beautifully described his own experience undergoing this shift:

I seemed imprisoned in myself. My life seemed like a glass tunnel, through which I was moving faster every year, and at the end of which there was darkness. When I changed my view, the walls of my glass tunnel disappeared. I now live in the open air. There is still a difference between my life and the lives of other people. But the difference is less. Other people are closer. I am less concerned about the rest of my own life, and more concerned about the lives of others.

I'm very grateful that we have charity evaluators whose entire job it is to find the nonprofits that genuinely do a lot of good with each dollar. Some nonprofits are much more effective than others trying to achieve the same goal, and all things being equal, we don't want to blow all our money on the wildly ineffective ones.

So, optimization definitely has its place in the world of charity, and I recommend giving generously to the “best buys” for improving people's well-being. But, I would caution you not to stretch optimization beyond its optimal limits.

If you want to optimize something, you have to be able to run an apples-to-apples comparison — to calculate how much good different things do in a single currency, so you can pick the best option. But helping people isn't reducible to one currency; it comes down to lots of incommensurable goods. How do you compare, say, preventing malaria with alleviating depression? Saving lives versus improving them? Or saving the life of a kid versus saving the life of an adult?

There is no objective One True Answer here. How to rank these different goods depends on each person's subjective philosophical assumptions. So, we need to give up the fantasy that there's some magic formula that can tell us how to optimize “the good” overall.

That doesn't mean anything goes, or that every charity is equally worthy of your money! It means the best you can do might be to consider how compelling you find the case for each one and divvy up your budget accordingly.

For example, I give about 85 percent of my charity each year to highly cost-effective organizations abroad like GiveDirectly and StrongMinds, because I know my money goes further in developing countries and I believe all lives are equally important. But, I also reserve a smaller amount for other things I value: a national homelessness organization, a social justice group, a media outlet, my meditation community, a group trying to preserve an endangered language.

Notice that some of these don't submit easily to quantification, and some aren't about furthering strictly “moral” goods. I think they're important anyway.

One of my touchstones is contemporary philosopher Susan Wolf's concept of the “moral saint” — someone who tries to make all their actions as morally good as possible.

Wolf argues that this is actually a bad ideal. We often think of “virtue” as being connected to morality, but Wolf's point is that there are also non-moral virtues, like artistic beauty. If you ignore those, you end up bereft of the things that make up a life well lived:

If the moral saint is devoting all his time to feeding the hungry or healing the sick or raising money for Oxfam, then necessarily he is not reading Victorian novels, playing the oboe, or improving his backhand. A life in which none of these possible aspects of character are developed may seem to be a life strangely barren.

I think that holds true both for how you spend your time and how you spend your money.

I encounter a lot of people who give so much of their time and money that they become overextended and resentful. Pop psychology would say these people need to get better at asserting “personal boundaries” — at drawing a sharp line between themselves and others. But, if you believe, as I do, that we're all actually profoundly interconnected and interdependent, then that idea of boundaries may feel like an unconvincing reason to practice self-preservation.

Instead, I think it's better to picture yourself as part of Indra's net. According to that classic Buddhist metaphor, an infinite net stretches out across the universe (a bit like a spiderweb). At each node where the threads intersect, there's a jewel (a bit like a dewdrop that sits on the spiderweb). Allan Watts, an American popularizer of Eastern philosophy, described it beautifully:

Imagine a multidimensional spider's web in the early morning covered with dew drops. And every dew drop contains the reflection of all the other dew drops. And, in each reflected dew drop, the reflections of all the other dew drops in that reflection. And so ad infinitum. That is the Buddhist conception of the universe in an image.

Because each dew drop (or jewel) contains the image of every other dew drop (or jewel) in the entire net, none of them exists as a separate, boundaried entity. Change one, and all the others change, too.

So, if you mess up your own well-being, you're diminishing one of these intrinsically precious bright spots. You're also diminishing every other bright spot in the net. That is not morally praiseworthy.

Giving money to charity can do a lot of good. That doesn't mean it's the only way to do good.

One of the most striking recognitions of this can be found in the Islamic tradition. The religion places a high premium on monetary charity, known as zakat. But, there's another form of giving: sadaqah. The Hadith, a collection of the sayings and traditions of the prophet Muhammad, contains a poetic explanation of sadaqah:

A sadaqah is due for every joint in each person on every day the sun comes up: to act justly between two people is a sadaqah; to help a man with his mount, lifting him onto it or hoisting up his belongings onto it, is a sadaqah; a good word is a sadaqah; and removing a harmful thing from the road is a sadaqah.

In other words, sadaqah comes in many shapes and sizes; it's broader than mere charity. It's what I would call solidarity. And notice how it's arguably even more morally demanding than monetary charity. All charity requires is writing a check — an action that can be done dispassionately, and even effortlessly for someone lucky enough to have money. It doesn't require commitment to a broader project of solidarity or justice. In fact, a common critique of charity is it can serve as a distraction from the unjust ways that wealth is created. But sadaqah requires you to be engaged, emotionally and often physically, too.

So, if you know people who don't donate money to charity, by all means, encourage them. Research suggests the most effective way to do this is to meet them with positive regard and empathy (not pressure or judginess) and to emphasize the joy you get out of giving (not the moral case for it). But above all, don't assume that they're not already doing a lot of good. They may be engaged in a different but equally valid practice of solidarity.

            Tuesday's special election in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, normally a conservative stronghold, is giving Democrats hope that their recently successful message of affordability can help them spring a major upset.
    


            The contest pits Trump-backed Republican Matt Van Epps against Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn. The winner will replace former Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July.
    


            A month after Democrats running on cost-of-living issues won in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia, both Van Epps and Behn have campaigned on affordability. Reflecting the Republican concerns about a district Green won last year by nearly 22 points, President Donald Trump called into events for Van Epps on Monday and House Speaker Mike Johnson visited Tennessee to campaign with him.
    


            “The problem is, when you have a deep-red district, a lot of the people take for granted that the Republican or the conservative is going to win,” Johnson said in a joint interview with Van Epps on Fox News Monday afternoon.
    


            Democrats have beaten their 2024 margins in US House special elections this year by an average of 16 points. A Democratic victory on Tuesday or even outperforming last year's results would further embolden Trump's opponents heading into the midterms.
    


            “Having had the privilege of representing Tennessee in years past, I want to tell you that I have never seen the political tides shift as far and as fast as we're seeing them move in this election,” said Al Gore, who represented the state in the US Senate before becoming vice president, at a virtual rally Monday night for Behn.
    


            At a campaign event earlier Monday, Johnson held a mic to his phone so the president could be heard exhorting the crowd to vote on Tuesday.
    


            “The whole world is watching Tennessee right now, and they're watching your district,” Trump said.
    


            Trump added: “It's a big vote, and it's gonna show something. It's got to show that the Republican Party is stronger than it's ever been.”
    


            Johnson's control of the House is already fragile. Democrats are poised to fill two vacancies in the new year, one created by the death of Texas Rep. Sylvester Turner, the other by New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill's resignation. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene also plans to resign in January.
    


            “Right now, every single seat matters, and this special election will fill an important one for us,” Johnson told reporters Monday night after an event in Clarksville.
    


            Behn has focused on lowering costs since the start of her campaign, saying in a recent ad featuring a mechanical bull that “hardworking Tennesseans are getting a rough ride” from rising healthcare and grocery costs and tariffs.
    


            Van Epps, a former Army helicopter pilot and state Department of General Services commissioner, isn't conceding the issue to Behn, arguing in ads that Democrats will raise costs and taxes.
    


            “Affordability is top of our list, and I'm excited to fight alongside the president and the speaker to drive down cost of living,” Van Epps told reporters Monday night.
    


            Van Epps and his allies have also attacked Behn as out of step with the conservative-leaning district. In ads and social media posts, Republicans have highlighted past comments from Behn where she called herself a “very radical person,” expressed support for defunding the police and said she hates Nashville, parts of which she now represents in the state legislature and are in the 7th District.
    


            A recent Van Epps TV ad brands Behn a “radical disaster” and says that “Tennessee can't afford (Democrats') radical agenda” of “new taxes that would crush working families.”
    


            Behn rejected that characterization in an interview with CNN.
    


            “I don't think it's radical to have spent my entire career organizing to make healthcare more affordable or groceries cheaper,” she said.
    

In an interview with CNN's Manu Raju, Aftyn Behn, the Democratic nominee for next week's special election in a heavily Republican Tennessee congressional district, responds to comments she made on a 2020 podcast episode about Nashville.


            Behn also noted that her 2020 calls to defund the police were from before she was a lawmaker and said she'd “matured” since then. She said decisions about law enforcement funding should be made locally.
    


            Van Epps said her calls to defund the police were “unacceptable and disqualifying” in a Fox News interview last week, adding that she stands for “things that are not right for Tennessee and not right for America.”
    


            Behn said her past comments about disliking country music and Nashville came from frustration with the city's tourism industry, notably the bachelorette parties that are ubiquitous in downtown.
    


            “(Republicans) must've loved Nashville so much they cut our congressional district (into) the three Republican districts,” Behn quipped, referencing the state's previous congressional map, which included a single district covering Nashville before it was redrawn after the 2020 Census.
    


            The 7th District now runs top-to-bottom through middle Tennessee and includes corners of Nashville.
    


            Between Democratic over-performance in special elections this year and the historically narrow Republican House majority, Tuesday's race has become a magnet for outside spending from both parties.
    


            Since the primary last month, more than $5 million has been spent on advertising in the race, according to data from AdImpact. Republican-aligned groups accounted for more than $3 million and Democratic allies spending at least $2 million.
    


            Former Vice President Kamala Harris, progressive Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas and Democratic Party Chair Ken Martin have made appearances supporting Behn.
    


            New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined the virtual rally for Behn Monday night along with Gore. Ocasio-Cortez described talking to Behn about a week ago and credited her courage for running in what was once seen as a safe Republican seat.
    


            “That kind of guts is what we need more of in this country,” she said. “And again, it's not just about an ideology, but it is about a character, a kind of person that says we're not going to do something because it's easy, we're going to do it because it's the right thing to do.”

            Jersey City voters will head to the polls Tuesday for a runoff to decide whether Jim McGreevey, who resigned from the New Jersey governorship in scandal more than 20 years ago, will complete a political comeback and become their next mayor.
    


            McGreevey stepped down less than halfway into his first term, admitting to an extramarital affair and disclosing that he was gay, amid accusations that he abused his official power to pursue a romantic relationship with an aide.
    


Former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey seeks mayoral run nearly 20 years after leaving office



            McGreevey will face city councilman James Solomon. The pair were the top vote-getters in a wide field in November's general election, but neither candidate garnered the required majority to avoid a runoff: Solomon received around 29% of the vote to McGreevey's 25%.
    


            The race is non-partisan, but both McGreevey and Solomon are Democrats. Solomon, the progressive candidate to the more moderate McGreevey, has collected endorsements from most of his primary opponents and Sen. Andy Kim. McGreevey has the endorsement of outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy.
    


            In a recent debate on WPIX-TV, both candidates focused on reducing rents in Jersey City and trying to build more affordable housing, echoing the national Democratic focus on affordability, along with concerns about immigration enforcement and education.
    


            “Every family deserves a shot to stay in this special city, and that's what I'm going to be focused on,” Solomon said.
    


            But McGreevey noted in an October interview with The Associated Press, prior to making the runoff, that becoming mayor would be “a great closing act.”
    


            “My opponents may care about what happened 20 years ago,” McGreevey told the AP. “Folks in Jersey City are worried about their rent today, worried about the children's individual education plan today. They're concerned about the fact that the street is dirty or that there's a sewer break on Montgomery (Street).”
    


            Jersey City has had the same mayor, Steve Fulop, since 2013. Fulop declined to run for another term in Jersey City to run for governor, losing in the Democratic primary to now Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill.

The Chicago Teachers Union has fallen years behind in fulfilling its obligation to provide members with an independent audit of its finances. While keeping the educators it represents in the dark, the union spent roughly $15.8 million supporting left-of-center political campaigns, according to public records. Now it faces a congressional investigation over its financial situation. 

Records show that the Chicago Teachers Union's most recent publicly available independent audit only covered the union's finances as of June 2019. The Republican-led House Committee on Education and Workforce, in a Nov. 20 letter, alleged that this “strips dues-paying members of their basic right to understand how their money is spent” and runs afoul of the organization's bylaws, which require such audits regularly. Since June 2019, the amount of money the union has given to liberal politicians and political action committees, other than its own, has been steadily increasing.

In 2019, the Chicago Teachers Union's political action committee, receiving funding from the union treasury, spent $1.7 million on donations to candidates for public office. That figure declined to $1.4 million in 2020, dipped slightly to $1.2 million in 2021, then rose to $1.9 million in 2022, exploded to over $3.6 million in 2023, and grew again to roughly $5 million in 2024, according to campaign finance filings.

Among the individuals to receive the most money from the Chicago Teachers Union while its members were barred from accessing independently audited financial information were Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D), the Illinois Federation of Teachers' PAC, and Chicago Board of Education member Ebony DeBerry. Some individuals that the Chicago Teachers Union threw the most money behind, such as school board candidates Jason Dones and Felix Ponce, who ultimately failed to win election to office. Johnson and DeBerry, meanwhile, have been staunch allies of the teachers union.

The lack of transparency from the Chicago Teachers Union spurred some members of the labor organization to sue it in October 2024, demanding an audit.

Critics have argued that union members may have good reason to be concerned about the state of the union's finances.

Analyses from the Illinois Policy Institute have found that the union spending on representational activities, operations associated with representing workers, declined from just 20% in 2024 to 18% in 2025. Furthermore, an inspector general's report released on November 12 found that Chicago Public Schools staff spent $7 million in COVID-19 relief funds on trips to international destinations, stays in luxury hotels, and Las Vegas conferences.

CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION GOT LAST-SECOND FUNDING FROM THE BIDEN EPA

“By withholding complete financial audits from its members, CTU has failed to uphold the spirit of union transparency or comply with its own bylaws,” the House Committee on Education and Workforce wrote in its November 20 letter to the Chicago Teachers Union. “As such, the Committee is investigating this matter to better determine whether the [Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act] should be amended to strengthen its requirements so that union members have access to more robust and timely financial information. Every dollar paid by workers should serve their interests, not those of a select few operating in the shadows.”

The Chicago Teachers Union, however, has agreed to cooperate with the committee's requests, though its lawyers insist that the investigation is a “waste of time.”

“We represent the Chicago Teachers Union in connection with the requests for documents contained in your letter of November 20, 2025,” a letter from the union's legal representation that was shared with the Washington Examiner read. ‘We will respond to the House Committee on Education and Workforce and cooperate with any legitimate requests. Indeed, we have already been in touch with Committee staff regarding the schedule for producing responsive documents and will produce them on or before December 22. We are confident that our responses will fully answer any legitimate questions and address the allegations contained in your letter.”

The letter further maintained that the union made its late financial audits available to members through an internal portal after the October 2024 lawsuit brought by its members regarding them.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) blasted House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and House Republicans for Democrats seeking to block an amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act that Stefanik advocated. Her provision would require notifying Congress if the FBI investigates candidates running for president and other federal offices. She accused Johnson and the GOP of “getting rolled” by House Democrats in an X post on Monday.

Stefanik said she would vote against the legislation if her provision were not “added back.”

“Republicans have the House, Senate, and the White House, yet the deep state is alive and well with the Speaker getting rolled by House Dems attempting to block my provision to require Congressional disclosure when the FBI opens counterintelligence investigations into presidential and federal candidates seeking office,” Stefanik posted.

Stefanik cited the actions of former FBI Director James Comey during the “Russia Hoax” and the Arctic Frost controversy as reasons for the necessity of her amendment. She called such investigations and law abuses criminal acts that can “never happen again.”

🚨🚨🚨Republicans have the House, Senate, and the White House, yet the deep state is alive and well with the Speaker getting rolled by House Dems attempting to block my provision to require Congressional disclosure when the FBI opens counterintelligence investigations into…

“In a March 2017 open hearing, my questions to former FBI Director James Comey began the unraveling of the Russia Hoax when Comey admitted to not following proper notification procedures with his illegal opening of Crossfire Hurricane,” Stefanik said. “A criminal act that can never happen again.” 

“My provision will strengthen this accountability and transparency to deter this illegal weaponization and it passed out of the House Intelligence Committee in this Congress and previous ones,” Stefanik added. “Yet House Republicans continue to get rolled by the deep state due to opposition by Jamie Raskin. If Republicans can't deliver accountability and legislative fixes to arguably the biggest illegal corruption and government weaponization issue of all time, then what are we even doing.” 

She also cited the recent leaks of conversations between foreign governments and U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff. She emphasized that removing her provision would be detrimental to accountability and threaten national security. She also said it was necessary to prevent the “weaponization” of the federal government and intelligence communities.

WHITE HOUSE INSISTS ‘DOUBLE TAP' ON BOAT-STRIKE SURVIVORS IN CARIBBEAN WAS LEGAL 

“This language is even more essential in light of the continued weaponization of the federal government evidenced by the sweeping Arctic Frost wiretapping scandal and the recent illegal leaks of Steve Witkoff's conversations with foreign counterparts,” Stefanik said. 

“It is a scandalous disgrace that Republicans are allowing themselves to be rolled by the Dems and deep state on this,” Stefanik concluded.

Officers flooded a Port St. Lucie neighborhood after a police sergeant was shot in the face while responding to a service call tied to a mental health dispute, authorities said. (WPTV) 

A Port St. Lucie police officer was shot in the face while responding to a service call Monday evening, authorities said.

Six officers arrived at the home that was the source of the call at the 11000 block of SW Lake Park Drive around 6 p.m.

Within a minute of their arrival, the officers were met by an adult male holding an assault rifle outside the home. The suspect exchanged gunfire with the officers and was shot dead, Police Chief Leo Niemczyk said.

Niemczyk identified the injured officer as Sgt. Erik LeVasseur, a 27-year veteran of the department. None of the other officers who responded to the home were injured, Niemczyk said.

Though details are still preliminary, Niemczyk said that the incident stemmed from a neighbor dispute involving a mental health call.

"It's the notification that you just dread every day, but it's always in the back of your mind, as a police chief, as a leader in law enforcement. It's something that you're always very aware of, afraid of, concerned for, and then it happens," Niemczyk said.

Sgt. LeVasseur was taken to HCA Florida Lawnwood Hospital in Fort Pierce and remains in surgery.

"We're very optimistic for his prognosis. And at this time, we're just asking for prayers," Niemczyk said.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — A tanker carrying sunflower oil from Russia to Georgia was attacked in the Black Sea, the Turkish maritime authority said Tuesday, days after two Russian “shadow fleet” oil tankers were attacked by Ukrainian naval drones.

The Turkish Directorate General of Maritime Affairs said the MIDVOLGA-2 came under attack about 130 kilometers (80 miles) off the Turkish coast. The 13 crew members were unharmed and the vessel has not requested assistance. 

It was heading toward the Turkish port of Sinop, the maritime authority said in a statement on X.

On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke out against Ukraine's drone attack on two Russian vessels, the Kairos and Virat, saying it signaled a “worrying escalation” of the conflict.

“We cannot condone these attacks, which threaten navigational safety, life, and the environment, especially in our own exclusive zone,” Erdogan said in a televised address. “We are issuing the necessary warnings to all parties regarding such situations.”

Friday's attacks against the Kairos and Virat occurred inside Turkey's exclusive economic zone. Crew members on board both vessels were reported to be safe.

The OpenSanctions database, which tracks people or organizations involved in sanctions evasion, describes the vessels as part of a fleet of ships used to evade sanctions imposed on Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine has carried out successful naval strikes against Russian shipping during the war, particularly using explosives-packed marine drones. However, Ukrainian missions have previously largely been limited to the waters of the northern Black Sea.

FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) — A Tennessee congressional seat that President Donald Trump and Republicans have previously won with ease became the unlikely epicenter of the fight for Congress on Monday, as House Speaker Mike Johnson headlined rallies and former Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told Democrats they could be on the verge of a monumental upset. 

Trump even called in twice during the day to tell voters to back Matt Van Epps, the Republican candidate, in Tuesday's special election.

“The whole world is watching Tennessee right now, and they're watching your district,” the president said after Johnson put him on speakerphone during an event inside a garage stocked with vintage cars on a supporters' sprawling farm in Franklin. “It's a big vote and it's gonna show something. And it's gonna show that the Republican Party is stronger than it's ever been.”

A few hours later, Trump drove home the message in a virtual rally, the second he's held for Van Epps since the former Army helicopter pilot and state general services commissioner became the Republican nominee. 

The rush of attention on the reliably conservative 7th U.S. House Congressional District came as Trump hopes to rebound from recent Republican losses around the country. Democrats want a strong showing that could propel them in next year's midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.

Behn, a self-proclaimed “pissed-off social worker” and progressive community organizer from Nashville, sprinted through her final campaign stops, including the virtual rally with Gore, a Tennessee native, and Ocasio-Cortez of New York.




Gore said people are struggling with high costs for groceries and health care while Trump is running “by far, the most corrupt administration in history,” enabled in Congress by “way too many subservient cowards.”

“Having had the privilege of representing Tennessee in years past, I want to tell you that I have never seen the political tides shift as far and as fast as we're seeing them move in this election,” Gore said. 

Ocasio-Cortez said the competitive race shows that “anything can happen and that miracles can happen, including in Tennessee” with hard work.

Behn has been described by some state Democrats as “our very own AOC of TN,” a nickname that Republicans have harnessed to deride Behn as too far left for the district. 

“They're bringing in all their heavy hitters because they think they can flip this seat from red to blue,” Johnson told reporters. “That is not going to happen.” Johnson is trying to maintain a narrow majority in the House, and he said the race is for “all the marbles.”

Republicans have expressed concerns about turnout because early voting went into Thanksgiving week and Election Day follows the holiday weekend. Van Epps was supported by a phalanx of party leaders on Monday, including national chairman Joe Gruters, Gov. Bill Lee, and Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty.

“I think that Matt's going to be OK,” Hagerty said. “But it's not just winning. It's winning by a wide enough margin to send a real Tennessee message that we're not going to stand for this.”

Former Vice President Kamala Harris appeared in Nashville to rally voters last month while on a book tour, and national party chair Ken Martin visited as well. 

The 7th District is one of three seats redrawn in 2022 to erode the influence of Nashville, the state's largest city and a Democratic stronghold. Only about 1 in 5 of the 14-county district's registered voters are in Nashville. Last year, the district went to former GOP Rep. Mark Green by 21 percentage points and to Trump by a similar margin.

Behn has condemned Trump's tariffs and tax cut legislation, both of which Van Epps supports.

Republicans have tried to turn Behn's own words against her in television advertising, such as when she described herself as a “radical” or claimed to be “bullying” immigration agents and state police officers. A frequent target are comments Behn made about Nashville years ago, when she said “I hate this city” and complained about annoyances like bachelorette parties.

For the most part, Behn has answered questions about those remarks by redirecting to cost-of-living issues. But she has responded specifically about Nashville, saying she wants it “to be a place where working people can thrive” even if she gets annoyed at some tourist draws.

“The barrage of negative attacks is a result of the fact that they don't have a plan to address the rising cost of health care,” Behn said at a campaign event Monday.

Jalen Smalls, a Behn voter, said his primary concern is getting people's basic needs met, such as funding for schools, feeding children, supporting hospitals and maintaining roads.

“Those are the bare minimum of what people need in order to thrive, not just survive,” Smalls said.

John Rowenczak, meanwhile, said he is voting for Van Epps because he is concerned that the country is becoming too liberal. He said his primary concern is illegal immigration.

“I feel like Trump is doing a good job, and that's kind of the way we need to go,” he said. “We want to continue the Trump agenda in this district.”

The House Majority PAC has put $1 million behind Behn. Van Epps has been backed by more than $1 million from the Trump-supporting MAGA Inc. super PAC.

Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries predicted an unexpectedly close race.

“Republicans have already lost,” Jeffries said Monday. “The fact that they are spending millions of dollars to hold a seat that Donald Trump just won by 22 points is extraordinary.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Since last week's shooting of two National Guard members in the nation's capital by a suspect who is an Afghan national, the Trump administration announced a flurry of policies aimed at making it harder for some foreigners to enter or stay in the country.

The administration said it was pausing asylum decisions, reexamining green card applications for people from countries “of concern” and halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

Days before the shooting, a memo obtained by The Associated Press said the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration.

The stepped up effort to restrict immigration has been harshly criticized by refugee advocates and those who work with Afghans, saying it amounts to collective punishment. Critics are also saying it is a waste of government resources to reopen cases that have already been processed. 

The Trump administration says the new policies are necessary to ensure that those entering the country — or are already here — do not pose a security threat. 

Here's a look at the major changes announced over roughly a week:




The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said on the social platform X last week that asylum decisions will be paused “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

Besides the post, no formal guidance has been put forward, so details remain scarce about the planned pause.

People seeking asylum must show to U.S. officials a threat of persecution if they were sent back to their home country, whether because of race, nationality or other grounds. If they're granted asylum, they're allowed to stay in the U.S. and eventually apply for a green card and then citizenship. 

The Afghan suspect in the National Guard shooting was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.

The right to apply for asylum was already restricted by the Trump administration. In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order essentially halting asylum for people who have come into the country through the southern border. Those cases generally go through immigration courts which are overseen by the Justice Department.

USCIS oversees the asylum process for foreigners the government isn't trying to remove via immigration courts. While Trump's January order didn't affect those cases, Edlow's social media post suggests they will now come under additional scrutiny. Edlow did not say how long the agency's pause on asylum decisions would last or what happens to people while those decisions are paused.

Caseloads have been rising for all types of asylum applications. USCIS said there are currently 1.4 million pending asylum cases at the agency. Just a few years ago, in 2022, it was 241,280, according to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics. Separately there are about 2.4 million pending asylum applications in front of the Justice Department's immigration courts.

On Nov. 27, Edlow said his agency was conducting a “full scale, rigorous reexamination” of every green card for people he said come from “every country of concern.”

“American safety is non negotiable,” Edlow said.

The agency said in a press release that same day that it was issuing new guidance that could make it tougher for people from 19 countries the administration considers “high-risk,” including Afghanistan, when they apply for immigration benefits such as applying for green cards or to stay in the U.S. longer.

The administration had already banned travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 of those countries and restricted access for people from seven others. 

Other stricter stricter measures are also directed at Afghans.

On Nov. 26, USCIS said it would be suspending all “immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals.” That would affect Afghans already living in the U.S. who are applying for green cards or work permits or permission to bring family members to the U.S.

Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X that the State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports.

The Trump administration had already severely limited travel and immigration from Afghanistan. The one avenue that had remained open was the Special Immigrant Visa program. Created by Congress, it allowed Afghans who closely supported the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan and faced retribution because of their work to emigrate to America.

But the State Department's announcement means even that avenue is now closed.

According to #AfghanEvac, a group that advocates for Afghans coming to the U.S., about 180,000 Afghans were in the process of applying for the SIV program.

Even before the shooting of two National Guard members, the Trump administration was planning a sweeping review of tens of thousands of immigrants who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration as part of the U.S. Refugee Assistance Program. 

That program, first launched in 1980, oversees the process by which people fleeing persecution can come to the U.S. Refugees are distinct from people seeking asylum, although they meet the same criteria. Refugees have to apply and wait outside the U.S. to be admitted while asylum-seekers do so once they reach the U.S.

Trump suspended the refugee program the day he took office and only a trickle of refugees have been admitted since then, either white South Africans or people admitted as part of a lawsuit seeking to restart the refugee program.

Then on Nov. 21, Edlow said in a memo obtained by The Associated Press that the administration was going to review all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration. That's nearly 200,000 refugees.

Advocates say refugees already undergo rigorous vetting.

Late Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested in a post on X that more changes could be in the offing.

Noting that she had just met with Trump, Noem said she was recommending a “full travel ban” on countries she said were flooding the U.S. “with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

Noem did not specifically name any countries and no timeline was given. The Department of Homeland Security said in an email Monday, “We will be announcing the list soon.”

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Tuesday threatened to cut off federal funding to Democratic-leaning states over their alleged refusal to share SNAP program data with the Trump administration.

The administration "will begin to stop moving federal funds into those states" starting next week "until they comply," Rollins told President Donald Trump during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.

Rollins said her department needs the state-by-state data on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as food stamps, "to root out this fraud and to protect the American taxpayer."

The secretary said the U.S. Department of Agriculture in February had asked all 50 states "for the first time to turn over their data to the federal government."

She said 29 "red states" complied, but 21 "blue states continue to say no."

The noncompliant states include California, New York and Minnesota, Rollins said. The governors' offices for each state did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

A USDA spokesperson later specified in a statement to CNBC, "28 States and Guam joined us in this fight; but states like California, New York, and Minnesota, among 19 other blue States, keep fighting us."

The department had "established a SNAP integrity team" to analyze state data and "end indiscriminate welfare fraud," the spokesperson said.

"We have sent Democrat States yet another request for data, and if they fail to comply, they will be provided with formal warning that USDA will pull their administrative funds."

President Donald Trump is holding a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Tuesday, as his administration grapples with a slew of major political issues that have come to the fore since the top officials last convened less than eight weeks earlier.

The meeting comes as bipartisan scrutiny ramps up over the administration's decision to fire multiple missile strikes on an alleged Venezuelan drug-running boat in early September. 

The White House said Monday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authorized Adm. Frank Bradley to order a second strike on the boat, which reportedly killed survivors of the initial attack.

Some experts and lawmakers have said the "double-tap" strike could constitute a war crime. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican, vowed on Monday to conduct oversight on the military action. The White House maintains the strikes were legal and conducted "in self defense."

The last Cabinet meeting was held on Oct. 9, in the middle of what became the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. 

The shutdown, which ended on Nov. 12 after 43 days, centered on a dispute over enhanced Affordable Care Act health-insurance subsidies, which are set to expire by the end of the year. The logjam broke after enough Democrats backed a funding deal that included a guarantee from the Senate's GOP majority to allow a vote in December on a bill of Democrats' choosing.

Numerous polls showed more Americans blamed Republicans for the shutdown, which overlapped with a string of blowout victories for Democrats in key elections in early November. The sweeping GOP rout set off alarm bells within Trump's party, which hopes to keep its slim congressional majorities after next year's midterms. 

The shifting dynamics have drawn focus to Tuesday's special election for a congressional seat in a deep-red Tennessee district, which appears to have grown competitive despite backing Trump by 22 points in 2024.

Days after the partisan shutdown fight ended, Congress surprisingly came together to back a bill ordering the Department of Justice to release its files on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Trump, a former friend of Epstein's who had fumed about the growing push to disclose the government's records on the deceased financier, ultimately told Republicans to vote for the bill. He signed it Nov. 19, starting a 30-day timer for Attorney General Pam Bondi to publicly release unclassified files relating to Epstein and his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's apparent openness to a U.S.-brokered peace plan with Russia is raising hope that an end to the yearslong land war in Europe could be coming into view. 

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner were seen on Tuesday morning in Moscow, where they were expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In this article

Amazon has found a way to let cloud clients extensively customize generative AI models. The catch is that the system costs $100,000 per year.

The Nova Forge offering from Amazon Web Services gives organizations access to Amazon's AI models in various stages of training so they can incorporate their own data earlier in the process. 

Already, companies can fine-tune large language models after they've been trained. The results with Nova Forge will lean more heavily on the data that customers supply. Nova Forge customers will also have the option to refine open-weight models, but training data and computing infrastructure are not included. 

Organizations that assemble their own models might end up spending hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, which means using Nova Forge is more affordable, Amazon said.

AWS released its own models under the Nova brand in 2024, but they aren't the first choice for most software developers. A July survey from Menlo Ventures said that by the middle of this year, Amazon-backed Anthropic controlled 32% of the market for enterprise LLMs, followed by OpenAI with 25%, Google with 20% and Meta with 9% — Amazon Nova had a less than 5% share, a Menlo spokesperson said.

The Nova models are available through AWS' Bedrock service for running models on Amazon cloud infrastructure, as are Anthropic's Claude 4.5 models.

"We are a frontier lab that has focused on customers," Rohit Prasad, Amazon head scientist for artificial general intelligence, told CNBC in an interview. "Our customers wanted it. We have invented on their behalf to make this happen."

Nova Forge is also in use by internal Amazon customers, including teams that work on the company's stores and the Alexa AI assistant, Prasad said. 

Reddit needed an AI model for moderating content that would be sophisticated about the many subjects people discuss on the social network. Engineers found that a Nova model enhanced with Reddit data through Forge performed better than commercially available large-scale models, Prasad said. Booking.com, Nimbus Therapeutics, the Nomura Research Institute and Sony are also building models with Forge, Amazon said.

Organizations can request that Amazon engineers help them build their Forge models, but that assistance is not included in the new service's $100,000 annual fee.

AWS is also introducing new models for developers at its Reinvent conference in Las Vegas this week.

Nova 2 Pro is a reasoning model whose tests show it performs at least as well as Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5, OpenAI's GPT-5 and GPT-5.1, and Google's Gemini 3.0 Pro Preview, Amazon said. Reasoning involves running a series of computations that might take extra time in response to requests to produce better answers. Nova 2 Pro will be available in early access to AWS customers with Forge subscriptions, Prasad said. That means Forge customers and Amazon engineers will be able to try Nova 2 Pro at the same time. 

Nova 2 Omni is another reasoning model that can process incoming images, speech, text and videos, and it generates images and text. It's the first reasoning model with that range of capability, Amazon said. Amazon hopes that, by delivering a multifaceted model, it can lower the cost and complexity of incorporating AI models into applications.

Tens of thousands of organizations are using Nova models each week, Prasad said. AWS has said it has millions of customers. Nova is the second-most popular family of models in Bedrock, Prasad said. The top group of models are from Anthropic.

Amazon's cloud unit on Tuesday announced AI-enabled software designed to help clients better understand and recover from outages. 

DevOps Agent, as the artificial intelligence tool from Amazon Web Services is called, predicts the cause of technical hiccups using input from third-party tools such as Datadog and Dynatrace. AWS said customers can sign up to use the tool Tuesday in a preview, before Amazon starts charging for the service.

The AI outage tool from AWS is intended to help companies more quickly figure out what caused an outage and implement fixes, Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of agentic AI at AWS, told CNBC. It's what site reliability engineers, or SREs, do at many companies that provide online services. 

SREs try to prevent downtime and jump into action during live incidents. Startups such as Resolve and Traversal have started marketing AI assistants for these experts. Microsoft's Azure cloud group introduced an SRE Agent in May.

Rather than waiting for on-call staff members to figure out what happened, the AWS DevOps Agent automatically assigns work to agents that look into different hypotheses, Sivasubramanian said.

"By the time the on-call ops team member dials in, they have an incident report with preliminary investigation of what could be the likely outcome, and then suggest what could be the remediation as well," Sivasubramanian told CNBC ahead of AWS' Reinvent conference in Las Vegas this week.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia has tested the AWS DevOps Agent. In under 15 minutes, the software found the root cause of an issue that would have taken a veteran engineer hours, AWS said in a statement.

The tool relies on Amazon's in-house AI models and those from other providers, a spokesperson said.

AWS has been selling software in addition to raw infrastructure for many years. Amazon was early to start renting out server space and storage to developers since the mid-2000s, and technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Oracle have followed.

Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, these cloud infrastructure providers have been trying to demonstrate how generative AI models, which are often training in large cloud computing data centers, can speed up work for software developers.

Over the summer, Amazon announced Kiro, a so-called vibe coding tool that produces and modifies source code based on user text prompts. In November, Google debuted similar software for individual software developers called Antigravity, and Microsoft sells subscriptions to GitHub Copilot.

Artificial intelligence startup Mistral released a new suite of models Tuesday as it looks to keep pace with leading AI labs Google, OpenAI and DeepSeek. 

The French company's announcement follows on from model releases from the likes of DeepSeek and Google in recent weeks, as AI labs across the globe scramble to remain at the frontier of research while also building out commercial operations. 

Mistral's release includes a large model which it claims is the "world's best open-weight multimodal and multilingual." It also announced the release of a small model the company says can be used in robotics, devices and drones.

Founded in 2023, Mistral has emerged as one of Europe's leading AI companies and raised a 1.7 billion euro funding round in September. Dutch chip equipment maker ASML contributed 1.3 billion euros of the raise, with Nvidia also participating. 

The round saw the startup — which was previously backed by Microsoft and Andreessen Horowitz — hit an 11.7 billion euro valuation.

"Mistral 3 sets a new standard for the global availability of AI and unlocks new possibilities for enterprises," the company said in a statement. 

"This spectrum of models further extends our customers' applied AI capabilities to robotics, autonomous drones, and small on-device applications without network access, as well as the world's largest enterprise agentic workflows."

Mistral's new large model offers powerful agentic capabilities and is engineered for AI assistants, retrieval-augmented systems, scientific workloads and complex enterprise workflows, the company said. 

The startup's new small model, dubbed Ministral 3, is small enough to run in drones, cars, robots, phones and laptops.

"Small models deliver advantages for most real-world applications: lower inference cost, reduced latency, and domain-specific performance," Mistral said. "They can be customized to outperform larger models on specific workflows and reach state-of-the-art performance for their size."

Ministral 3 can be deployed on a single graphics processing unit (GPU), which the company said reduced running costs and sped up iteration. 

"The next chapter of AI isn't just bigger — it's smarter, faster, and open," the company said. "Together, we're building towards an era of distributed intelligence."

The latest releases come as Mistral looks to ramp up commercial activity in a bid to justify its nearly 12 billion euro price tag.

Alongside a deal with HSBC to give the multinational bank access to its models for tasks ranging from financial analysis to translation, announced on Monday, Mistral has inked contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars with several corporates. 

The startup is also increasingly looking to M&A as it accelerates growth. While considered a leading homegrown player in the AI space in Europe, Mistral's war chest pales in comparison to a cohort of U.S. rivals that are increasingly setting up shop on the continent. 

Anthropic, which announced a $13 billion raise at a $183 billion valuation in September, and OpenAI, which reportedly sold secondary shares at a $500 billion price tag in October, have both announced new offices in Europe in 2025.

Michael Burry questioned Tesla's valuation as the investor of "The Big Short" fame took aim at the practice of technology companies issuing tons of stock-based compensation and excluding it from earnings results.

The investor argues that when accounting for the true profits that include the cost of this compensation and its negative dilution of the company's value over time, companies like Tesla should have lower valuations.

"Tesla's market capitalization is ridiculously overvalued today and has been for a good long time," Burry, who rose to fame for his call on a housing market bubble in the 2000s, wrote to subscribers of his new paid Substack.

Burry pointed out that Tesla dilutes shareholders at a rate of 3.6% each year and doesn't offer buybacks. He posted a chart with subscribers that he said "shows the kind of present value destruction that this level of dilution can impart."

He said the vote to accept CEO Elon Musk's $1 trillion compensation plan means investors should expect to get diluted further — meaning that that these additional shares water down their ownership of the company. The package had 75% approval among voting shares, despite proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS coming out against it.

"With recent news of Elon Musk's $1 trillion dollar pay package, dilution is certain to continue," Burry wrote.

Tesla's market cap is currently $1.43 trillion. The electric vehicle maker's shares have added more than 6% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 has surged more than 15% in the same period.

Burry noted that moving past dilution "is not easy" for businesses. He also pointed to Palantir and Amazon as other well-known technology companies that dilute their shares through employee-based compensation, a practice that Burry said "penalizes shareholders."

The newsletter post goes into an in-depth explanation of how stock-based compensation is not accurately reflected under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and how companies used "adjusted" earnings to present a bottom line that wrongly ignores the practice as a real expense.

Burry quotes Warren Buffett's view of stock-based compensation being treated as something other than a tangible expense: "What else could it be — a gift from shareholders?" wrote Buffett in his Berkshire Hathaway 2018 annual letter.

Burry launched his Substack called "Cassandra Unchained" late last month after deregistering hedge fund Scion Asset Management. The blog, which has a $379 annual subscription fee, has so far focused on why he believes artificial intelligence is a bubble.

MongoDB shares ripped 25% higher on Tuesday after the company blew past Wall Street's third-quarter expectations and lifted its forecast as its cloud database platform gained traction with customers. 

The database software provider posted adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share on $628 million in revenue. That topped the 80 cents adjusted per share and $592 million in revenue expected by analysts polled by LSEG. Revenues grew 19% from last year.

MongoDB said its Atlas platform grew 30% from a year ago and accounted for 75% of total revenues for the quarter. The company said it ended the period with more than 60,800 Atlas customers, with revenues  expected to grow 27% for the platform in the current period.

"Q3 was an exceptional quarter that was driven by our continued go-to-market execution and the broad-based demand we are seeing across business," said CEO Chirantan "CJ" Desai in his first earnings call at the helm of the company. 

Dev Ittycheria, who ran the company for 11 years and took it public, stepped down in November.

Desai believes the company is approaching a "once in a lifetime" opportunity as artificial intelligence, cloud and data trends reach a "true inflection point." He told investors he plans to focus on building customer relationships and innovation in the coming months. 

Citing those tailwinds, MongoDB boosted its guidance for the full year on Atlas growth and tailwinds from ongoing artificial intelligence demand. The company now anticipates revenues between $2.434 billion and $2.439 billion, up from prior guidance of $2.34 billion and $2.36 billion. 

Analysts at Bernstein lifted their price target on shares to $452, expecting the stock to continue benefiting from accelerating growth as other software companies struggle. 

 "We expect strong consumption demand, potential upside from AI, and benefits from an easing interest rate environment to continue driving re-rating upside in the near term," they wrote. 

Shares have popped more than 40% this year.

Michael and Susan Dell announced Tuesday that they have committed $6.25 billion to fund investment accounts for some 25 million American children. 

The couple's donation will be the largest ever devoted to American children, according to Invest America, a nonprofit advocacy group partnered with the Dells.

"It's designed to help families feel supported from the start and encourage them to keep saving as their children grow," Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, told CNBC in an interview. "We know that when children have accounts like this, they're much more likely to graduate from high school, from college, buy a home, start a business and less likely to be incarcerated."

The Dells' commitment goes hand in hand with a new federal government program that allows parents to open tax-advantaged investment accounts for children under 18 with Social Security numbers. Under the federal program, U.S. citizens born from the beginning of 2025 through 2028 will receive a federal grant of $1,000 to seed those so-called Trump accounts. Parents will be able to open and contribute to these accounts starting on July 4, 2026, with IRS guidance yet to be issued.

The Dells have committed to seed Trump accounts with $250 for children who are 10 or under who were born before Jan. 1, 2025. According to Invest America, the pledged funds will cover 25 million children age 10 and under in ZIP codes with a median income of $150,000 or less. 

"We want to help the children that weren't part of the government program," Dell said.

Dell said he first became interested in seeding investment accounts for children after hearing the idea from hedge fund manager Brad Gerstner around 2021. Gerstner, CEO of Altimeter Capital, later founded Invest America, which advocated for the program to get included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Trump Accounts can only be used to invest in low-cost diversified funds that track a U.S. stock index. Gerstner said these accounts and grants give American children the chance to benefit from U.S. stock market growth at an early age.

Gerstner said it will take more than the $250 from the Dells or $1,000 federal grants for the accounts to compound to a substantial sum. However, Gerstner said the seed money encourages parents to add their own funds. 

He added that the legislation makes it far easier for corporations and philanthropists to make charitable contributions on a large scale. Dell Technologies has pledged to match the $1,000 grants by the U.S. Treasury deposited into accounts for new children of employees.

Parents only have to open a Trump account to automatically receive a grant from the Dells.

"It would have been impractical, or maybe even impossible, to impact this many kids in this way without such a program," Dell said.

There are few precedents for the Dells' pledge. The foundation of shoe billionaire Harold Alfond, who died in 2007, issues $500 educational grants toward every child born in Maine.

While Trump accounts are easy to seed, they lack some of the tax advantages of other accounts such as 529 accounts or Roth IRAs. Withdrawals are not allowed until the child turns 18, at which point the assets are rolled into an IRA and withdrawals are taxed.

Dell said he has spoken to other major philanthropists and is optimistic that others will also pledge funds to these investment accounts.

"What we hope is that every child sees a future worth saving for it," he said. "You think about the compounding effect of a program like this in 10, 20, 30 years on millions of children. That's what gets us excited."

Correction: This story has been updated to clarify where the money will come from when parents open a Trump account.

Nvidia-backed video generation startup Luma AI is joining a growing wave of U.S. tech companies launching operations in the U.K., with major plans for a London expansion revealed on Tuesday.

The Palo Alto-headquartered startup will look to hire around 200 employees — making up around 40% of its workforce — at its new London base by early 2027, across research, engineering, partnerships and strategic development. 

The expansion comes two weeks on from Luma announcing a $900 million funding round led by Saudi Public Investment Fund-owned AI company Humain, which saw it hit a valuation upwards of $4 billion. The startup previously received backing from Nvidia. 

Luma is building "world models," a class of AI models that are able to learn from video, audio and images, alongside text, and which large language models (LLMs) like those powering OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini use. 

The startup is currently targeting marketing, advertising, media and entertainment sectors with its video models, which it sells via an application programming interface (API) and as part of a content creation suite.

"With this Series C raise and the upcoming build-out of global compute infrastructure, we have the capital and capacity to bring world-scale AI to creatives everywhere," said Amit Jain, CEO and co-founder of Luma AI. "Launching across Europe and the Middle East is the logical next step in putting this power directly in the hands of storytellers, agencies and brands globally."

The U.K. is the starting point of the expansion because of its access to talent, Jain told CNBC.

"London has some of the best people when it comes to research, given the universities here and institutions like DeepMind," he said. "We also consider London to be the entry point to the European market."

Luma is the latest in a wave of North American AI labs doubling down on the U.K. and Europe as they look to take advantage of talent pools and revenue opportunities.

In November, San Francisco-based Anthropic announced plans to open offices in Paris and Munich, months on from kicking off a hiring spree in London and Dublin. Canadian AI startup Cohere said it would open a Paris office to become its EMEA headquarters in September and OpenAI announced a new office in Munich in February.

While world models may not yet be as developed as LLMs, some researchers say they are as, if not more, crucial in the pursuit of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

"These kinds of visual models are about a year to a year-and-a-half behind language models right now," said Jain. 

But world models will become the "natural interface" for AI for most day-to-day use in time, he predicted, pointing to the amount of time people spend watching video content each day. 

Tech giants including Google, Meta and Nvidia are all developing world models for a range of use cases.

Luma released its latest model, Ray3, in September, which Jain told CNBC benchmarks higher than OpenAI's Sora and at similar levels to Google's Veo 3.

A YouTube tool that uses creators' biometrics to help them remove AI-generated videos that exploit their likeness also allows Google to train its artificial intelligence models on that sensitive data, experts told CNBC.

In response to concern from intellectual property experts, YouTube told CNBC that Google has never used creators' biometric data to train AI models and it is reviewing the language used in the tool's sign-up form to avoid confusion. But YouTube told CNBC it will not be changing its underlying policy. 

The discrepancy highlights a broader divide inside Alphabet, where Google is aggressively expanding its AI efforts while YouTube works to maintain trust with creators and rights holders who depend on the platform for their businesses.

YouTube is expanding its "likeness detection," a tool the company introduced in October that flags when a creator's face is used without their permission in deepfakes, the term used to describe fake videos created using AI. The feature is being expanded to millions of creators in the YouTube Partner Program as AI-manipulated content becomes more prevalent throughout social media.

The tool scans videos uploaded across YouTube to identify where a creator's face may have been altered or generated by artificial intelligence. Creators can then decide whether to request the video's removal, but to use the tool, YouTube requires that creators upload a government ID and a biometric video of their face. Biometrics are the measurement of physical characteristics to verify a person's identity.

Experts say that by tying the tool to Google's privacy policy, YouTube has left the door open for future misuse of creators' biometrics. The policy states that public content, including biometric information, can be used "to help train Google's AI models and build products and features."

"Likeness detection is a completely optional feature, but does require a visual reference to work," YouTube spokesperson Jack Malon said in a statement to CNBC. "Our approach to that data is not changing. As our Help Center has stated since the launch, the data provided for the likeness detection tool is only used for identity verification purposes and to power this specific safety feature."

YouTube told CNBC it is "considering ways to make the in-product language clearer." The company has not said what specific changes to the wording will be made or when they will take effect. 

Experts remain cautious, saying they raised concerns about the policy to YouTube months ago.

"As Google races to compete in AI and training data becomes strategic gold, creators need to think carefully about whether they want their face controlled by a platform rather than owned by themselves," said Dan Neely, CEO of Vermillio, which helps individuals protect their likeness from being misused and also facilitates secure licensing of authorized content. "Your likeness will be one of the most valuable assets in the AI era, and once you give that control away, you may never get it back."

Vermillio and Loti are third-party companies working with creators, celebrities and media companies to monitor and enforce likeness rights across the internet. With advancements in AI video generation, their usefulness has ramped up for IP rights holders.

Loti CEO Luke Arrigoni said the risks of YouTube's current biometric policy "are enormous."  

"Because the release currently allows someone to be able to attach that name to the actual biometrics of the face, they could create something more synthetic that looks like that person," Arrigoni said.

Neely and Arrigoni both said they would not currently recommend that any of their clients sign up for likeness detection on YouTube.

YouTube's head of creator product, Amjad Hanif, said YouTube built its likeness detection tool to operate "at the scale of YouTube," where hundreds of hours of new footage are posted every minute. The tool is set to be made available to the more than 3 million creators in the YouTube Partner Program by the end of January, Hanif said. 

"We do well when creators do well," Hanif told CNBC. "We're here as stewards and supporters of the creator ecosystem, and so we are investing in tools to support them on that journey."

The rollout comes as AI-generated video tools rapidly improve in quality and accessibility, raising new concerns for creators whose likeness and voice are central to their business.

YouTube creator Mikhail Varshavski, a physician who goes by Doctor Mike on the video platform, said he uses the service's likeness detection tool to review dozens of AI-manipulated videos a week.

Varshavski has been on YouTube for nearly a decade and has amassed more than 14 million subscribers on the platform. He makes videos reacting to TV medical dramas, answering questions on health fads and debunking myths. He relies on his credibility as a board-certified physician to inform his viewers.

Rapid advances in AI have made it easier for bad actors to copy his face and voice in deepfake videos that could give his viewers misleading medical advice, Varshavski said. 

He first encountered a deepfake of himself on TikTok, where an AI-generated doppelgänger promoted a "miracle" supplement.

"It obviously freaked me out, because I've spent over a decade investing in garnering the audience's trust and telling them the truth and helping them make good health-care decisions," he said. "To see someone use my likeness in order to trick someone into buying something they don't need or that can potentially hurt them, scared everything about me in that situation."

AI video generation tools like Google's Veo 3 and OpenAI's Sora have made it significantly easier to create deepfakes of celebrities and creators like Varshavski. That's because their likeness is frequently featured in the datasets used by tech companies to train their AI models. 

Veo 3 is trained on a subset of the more than 20 billion videos uploaded to YouTube, CNBC reported in July. That could include several hundred hours of video from Varshavski.

Deepfakes have "become more widespread and proliferative," Varshavski said. "I've seen full-on channels created weaponizing these types of AI deep fakes, whether it was for tricking people to buy a product or strictly to bully someone."

At the moment, creators have no way to monetize unauthorized use of their likeness, unlike the revenue-sharing options available through YouTube's Content ID system for copyrighted material, which is typically used by companies that hold large copyright catalogs. YouTube's Hanif said the company is exploring how a similar model could work for AI-generated likeness use in the future.

Earlier this year, YouTube gave creators the option to permit third-party AI companies to train on their videos. Hanif said that millions of creators have opted into that program, with no promise of compensation.

Hanif said his team is still working to improve the accuracy of the product but early testing has been successful, though he did not provide accuracy metrics.

As for takedown activity across the platform, Hanif said that remains low largely because many creators choose not to delete flagged videos.

"They'll be happy to know that it's there, but not really feel like it merits taking down," Hanif said. "By and far the most common action is to say, 'I've looked at it, but I'm OK with it.'"

Agents and rights advocates told CNBC that low takedown numbers are more likely due to confusion and lack of awareness rather than comfort with AI content.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amina Green, a 29-year-old data scientist based in San Francisco. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. A Waymo spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

I remember being excited for my first Waymo ride earlier last year.

When I was a child, I got into a really bad car accident, so I've always been afraid to drive myself around. It's a personal choice for me not to get my driver's license, so I walk most places in San Francisco or use ride-hailing.

I've known about autonomous-driving technology for a while. I've been living in SF for about five years. So it was exciting just to even step inside a Waymo for the first time.

The robotaxi felt safe. I appreciate the ease of use, the convenience, and the privacy.

Sometimes, after coming back from therapy, I call a Waymo because I can be in a sensitive state of mind, so I'd prefer to be alone.

It's also just fun. It feels so sci-fi. I even made a video of myself doing my makeup inside the robotaxi, and it got a lot of views on social media. There's the novelty of it to some extent. But it's also like having my own energy or vibe in the car; I can set the music to what I like, I can control the temperature — those sorts of things.

Then, in September 2024, I was involved in an incident inside a Waymo that left me a little scared and frustrated.

I was heading to an appointment to get my hair braided. I remember sitting in the front seat of the Waymo, filming randomly as I've gotten into the habit of recording myself inside the car.

Then, near the South of Market-Tenderloin area, these two guys stepped right in front of my ride after the Waymo stopped for a red light.

I don't know why they did that. They seemed like they were trying to be silly, but they kept badgering me for my number. I repeatedly told them to get out of the way, to stop, and that they were holding up traffic.

🚨Warning to women in SF 🚨I love Waymo but this was scary 😣2 men stopped in front of my car and demanded that I give my number.It left me stuck as the car was stalled in the street.Thankfully, it only lasted a few minutes...Ladies please be aware of this pic.twitter.com/6VEqb1WoJb

I was annoyed because I was already running late for my hair appointment. But I was also a bit afraid. I used to work for a nonprofit in this neighborhood, so I knew that if something happened, there wouldn't be police nearby or anyone to really help.

The most frustrating part was that after the guys left, my Waymo just sat there. It was a little scary, but also kind of annoying. Other drivers on the road were getting upset, and I felt like a sitting duck. If it had happened at night, it would've been a lot scarier.

I don't remember if I called Waymo's remote assistance or if they contacted me, but the support team determined that something had happened during my ride. They asked if I was OK; I said yes and talked a bit. Throughout the day, they called me two more times to make sure I was OK.

I ended up getting $100 in credit and participated in a user research experience with the Waymo team. It was interesting to see the features they're working on.

After the incident, I stopped taking Waymo for maybe about two or three months.

After a while, I started taking Waymo again because I still feel safer riding in a Waymo than in a human-driven vehicle.

I've been using ride-hailing services for nearly 10 years. I've had mostly positive experiences using them, but I've also had a few weird incidents.

There are situations where I wouldn't have wanted to be alone in a car with a stranger at night.

Sometimes, the ride is just straight-up dangerous. I recall a driver who was distracted by his phone, watching YouTube videos while driving.

I usually report these incidents, but I'm not sure how the companies handled the situation.

I feel safer knowing that Waymo has personnel on standby in case something happens to its cars.

That's not to say Waymo is perfect.

Beyond getting the engineering right, I think there are social and cultural factors the company should consider if it wants the technology to be widely adopted.

For example, people interact with the streets differently in different neighborhoods. I think about the Tenderloin, where it's common for people to run into the middle of the street. Is Waymo thinking about the kinds of environments its cars go through?

Maybe Waymo could give users different route options that could avoid certain neighborhoods. It may not be politically correct to say, but I think this is just the basic reality of the world we live in: There are certain neighborhoods where women, or any person, might be more likely targeted if you're by yourself.

It would also be nice if there were an extra security feature, such as automatically locking the door once the rider steps into the car.

Then, there are a lot of people in the city who aren't in tech. To them, Waymo is a symbol of this larger cultural change in the region that they feel like they're being left out of.

So, while I don't agree with it, I almost understand why some people would vandalize the cars.

I'm also just a practical rider. I still use human ride-hailing services — I'd say it's about 50-50 — because Waymo's wait time can be a bit long. Or sometimes Waymo's just way more expensive.

Ultimately, I'm positive about the technology. I hope this will be widely available, but there are some considerations and edge cases that may need to be addressed before mass adoption.

ChatGPT turned three years old the other day, which means we've spent three years in an AI frenzy.

It also means hundreds of millions of people have been using ChatGPT for years and … not seeing any ads at all, whether they're using the paid version or the free one.

That's not totally astonishing: We've gotten used to consumer internet products like Google, Facebook, and Instagram taking off without ads for a few years. And then, the deluge.

So how much longer will ChatGPT remain ad-free? And what happens when it isn't?

Over the weekend, we got a hint that an ad push may be underway, via some code from ChatGPT's Android app unearthed by developer Tibor Blaho:

ChatGPT Android app 1.2025.329 beta includes new references to an "ads feature" with "bazaar content", "search ad" and "search ads carousel" pic.twitter.com/BdHOJIQHmA

Scouring apps for yet-to-be-released features is a long-standing tech hobby, and sometimes it really does yield results. It's also entirely possible that what Blaho found is … something other than an ad product road map.

But it still seems very, very likely that ChatGPT will have ads at some point.

We know this in part because OpenAI executives, starting with Sam Altman, have suggested they will be coming (in 2024, Altman said ads were gross; this year, he allowed that maybe OpenAI could make "some cool ad product").

We know it because OpenAI has been stocking itself with talent from Meta — one of the most successful advertising companies in the world.

We know it because it's simply logical: Altman says ChatGPT has around 800 million weekly users, and only a small percentage of them pay. At some point, his company will want to convert those non-paying users into revenue-generating ones, and ads are the obvious way to do that.

And we know it because on Monday, via an internal memo, OpenAI acknowledged that it was working on ads — but was now delaying that push, while it scrambled to improve its core product in the face of competition from Google. (I've asked OpenAI for comment; while we're here, I'll note that OpenAI has a business partnership with Axel Springer, which owns Business Insider.)

Meanwhile, The Information reports, OpenAI focus groups show that some ChatGPT users already assume ads play a role in the results they're seeing. 

But none of that tells us when ads will actually arrive in ChatGPT. And it certainly doesn't address the core question about what happens when you inject ads into an answer machine: Does that machine give you the best answers? Or the answers someone has paid to give you?

Which brings us to the next question: If ads do show up, what would they look like? Because sticking ads into an AI assistant isn't like putting them next to search results or inside a news feed. There's no feed. There's just the answer.

There are a few obvious possibilities, none of which are mutually exclusive:

• Search-style intent ads

This is the Google model: You tell Google exactly what you're looking for — "dumpling spot near me," "best Chromebook" — and advertisers bid to appear next to those queries. If ChatGPT is now a legitimate Google rival, why not use Google's business model, too?

• Personalized ads based on everything ChatGPT knows about you

This is the Meta model: Instead of bidding on queries, advertisers target people, based on what it has learned about their behavior, on and off Meta's properties.

• Old-school text links

The simplest version: "You asked for the best toaster, here are three recommendations, one of which is sponsored." That's basically affiliate marketing. It's low-key and probably the least lucrative.

• Multimedia ads

You are probably typing things into ChatGPT and reading its results. But it doesn't have to work like that: ChatGPT can already talk and show you images. Via Sora, it can show you video. The magic device famed designer Jony Ive is building for the service likely won't have any screen at all. All of which means that Altman and Co. may have a choice to serve you ads that aren't tiny boxes of text on your phone.

But no matter what route OpenAI takes, all of its ad plans will have the same peril: the possibility that injecting paid messages in a service you count on could change your relationship with that service, and weaken that trust.

It's a gnarly problem, even for a company that's used to moving quickly and fixing messes after the fact. They might move more slowly on this one than some people think.

The booming American drone market is having a moment.

From niche gadgets to strategic infrastructure, the growing industry is getting another boost from the Trump administration's supercharged defense spending and the military's growing interest in heavily investing in drones.

The resulting boom isn't just benefiting the legacy players.

Early-stage drone startups are suddenly winning contracts once typically reserved for more established defense companies, a frenzy that has turned 2025 into a breakout year for drones across both defense and commercial markets.

Defense-focused drone startups are motivated to work on the tech and "make sure the West wins in the emerging era of unmanned wars," Ethan Thornton, CEO and founder of Mach Industries, said in an email to Business Insider. His startup recently won a US Army contract for its cruise missiles.

This is the first installment in a three-part series on the major players in the drone industry. If you have a drone-related or defense tech tip, contact this reporter by email at jhornstein@insider.com or securely on Signal at juliah.22.

Stay tuned for:

Business Insider dug into the booming drone market, looking at the startups winning the biggest term sheets and government contracts this year. Figures on the number of employees and the amount of funding each company has raised are based on data provided by PitchBook, unless otherwise specified.

Here's a list of the startups trying to define how drone tech is being built, deployed, and used by governments and commercial customers alike:

Founders include: Palmer Luckey, Brian Schimpf, Trae Stephens, Matt Grimm, Joseph Chen

Total funding: $6.8 billion, according to the company

Founding year: 2017

Key investors: Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, 8VC, Lux Capital, Valor Equity Partners, Elad Gil

Number of employees: 6,000, according to the company

What it does: Founded in 2017 after Palmer Luckey was ousted from Facebook, now Meta Platforms, Anduril makes a suite of autonomous products and AI systems for militaries. The company produces several air systems for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and search and rescue. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump called Anduril's Roadrunner vertical takeoff and landing drone (VTOL) — which can also be configured into a "high-explosive interceptor variant" — a "nasty looking thing" at a press conference.

Founders include: Dan Magy, Chad McCoy, Ian Muceus

Total funding: $49.5 million

Founding year: 2022

Key investors: New Enterprise Associates, Washington Harbour Partners, Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin, Craft Ventures

Number of employees: 110

What it does: Firestorm's flagship product, xCell, is a micro-factory that can quickly produce drone replacement parts and small aerial vehicles that can be configured for specific uses. The company also makes its own suite of modular drones, such as the Tempest, which can be reconfigured by warfighters looking to adjust the drone's payload and propulsion. Investment in the technology comes as the Pentagon seeks ways to ramp up drone production in the field, especially in contested areas.

Founders include: Niklas Koehler, Torsten Reil, Gundbert Scherf

Total funding: $1.5 billion

Founding year: 2021

Key investors: Accel, General Catalyst, Lightspeed, Prima Materia

Number of employees: 900

What it does: Headquartered in Munich, Helsing makes AI battlefield software. Helsing's latest fundraise, a $695 million round in June led by Prima Materia, a fund founded by Spotify chairman and CEO Daniel Ek, makes the company one of the more well-financed European startups. The company also makes a strike drone, called HX-2, and Ca-1 Europa, an uncrewed fighter jet. And it's moving into the maritime space as well: In October, Helsing acquired Blue Ocean, a marine technology company specializing in autonomous underwater vehicles.

Founders include: Ethan Thornton

Total funding: $197 million, according to the company

Founding year: 2023

Key investors: Bedrock, Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital

Number of employees: 200, according to the company

What it does: Like many of its competitors, Mach Industries is banking on the future of warfare, prioritizing mass-produced, cheap, smaller drones over prime contractors' multimillion-dollar fighter jets. With a development contract from the Pentagon, Mach is making a VTOL strike aircraft called Viper. It's also working on Glide, a high-altitude glider that can deliver munitions to locations thousands of miles away.

"Mach takes a deeply vertically integrated, hardware first approach to defense, rapidly iterating and mass manufacturing our products to make sure the West wins in the emerging era of unmanned wars," Ethan Thornton, CEO and Founder of Mach Industries said in an email.

Founders include: Olaf Hichwa, Soren Monroe-Anderson

Total funding: $121 million, according to the company

Founding year: 2023

Key investors: Sequoia Capital, Vy Capital, Interlagos

Number of employees: 94, according to the company

What it does: Neros makes drones and ground control stations. It's selling its flagship first-person view (FPV) drone, Archer, to the US Army as part of its Purpose-Built Attritable Systems program. Earlier this year, Neros also received a $17 million contract from the Marine Corps for roughly 8,000 FPV drones. Cofounder Soren Monroe-Anderson told Business Insider in an email that the company is building "a secure, China-free supply chain."

Founders include: Armin Busse, Tobias Kloss, Michael Kriegel, Florian Seibel, Michael Wohlfahrt

Total funding: $535 million

Founding year: 2015

Key investors: Peter Thiel, Thiel Capital

Number of employees: 550

What it does: The German, Thiel-backed company Quantum-Systems makes a suite of drones, sensors, as well as mission and mapping software. Its Trinity Pro is an electric VTOL drone used for mapping terrain.

Founders include: Andrew Rieter, Ryan Tseng, Brandon Tseng

Total funding: $1.6 billion, according to the company

Founding year: 2015

Key investors: Andreessen Horowitz, United States Innovative Technology, L3 Harris Technologies USIT

Number of employees: 1,200, according to the company

What it does: Shield AI makes the V-BAT, a VTOL drone, and the X-BAT, an AI-powered VTOL fighter jet. In July, the US Coast Guard completed testing of the V-BAT as "preparation for future installation of the V-BAT UAS [unmanned aircraft systems]" across its vessels, according to a press release. The company also develops Hivemind, an AI software tool to manage uncrewed aerial systems.

"Customers using our AI-piloted drones generate strategic results and outcomes," Brandon Tseng, cofounder and president told Business Insider in an email, touting the company's 165 flights in Ukraine and 24 strategic strikes from this year. "We walk the walk."

Founders include: Adam Bry, Abe Bachrach, Matt Donahoe

Total funding: $740 million, according to the company

Founding year: 2014

Key investors: Axon, Linse, NVIDIA, Andreessen Horowitz, IVP, Next47

Number of employees: 812, according to the company

What it does: Skydio is one of the earlier movers in the drone space. Founded in 2014, the company makes autonomous drones for government and commercial use. Its X10 drone — a small, AI-powered, uncrewed vehicle — can be outfitted with anything from a telephoto lens to a radiometric thermal camera. Police departments and county sheriff's offices have used Skydio drones to track crime, according to the company's website.

Founders include: Alex Pachikov, Chris Eheim, Nick de Palézieux

Total funding: $33 million, according to the company

Founding year: 2016

Key investors: Sequoia, General Catalyst, Stanley Ventures

Number of employees: 40, according to the company

What it does: Sunflower Labs develops an autonomous security drone system called Beehive, a network of drones that the company says can surveil large commercial properties — such as data centers, warehouses, and other industrial sites — potentially deterring and capturing security footage of theft and vandalism. When it detects a threat, a Sunflower Labs drone — known as a Bee — emerges from its dock and autonomously navigates to the designated location.

Founders include: Keller Rinaudo Cliffton, Keenan Wyrobek, Ryan Oksenhorn

Total funding: $1.2 billion

Founding year: 2014

Key investors: Sequoia Capital, Slow Ventures, Valor Equity Partners

Number of employees: 1,400, according to the company

What it does: Zipline aims to make delivery even more seamless than Uber: Customers can place orders through the Zipline application on their phones, and the company's drone will handle the rest. The drone flies at 300 feet during delivery and sounds "like a breeze in the trees," according to the company. Zipline advertises companies such as Walmart, Panera Bread, Sweetgreen, and Chipotle as partners. In 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized Zipline to deliver commercial goods beyond the visual line of sight — meaning outside an operator's direct line of sight — around Salt Lake City. In 2024, the FAA approved Zipline's airspace traffic system, which the company says can manage drone traffic.

In this article

SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son on Monday downplayed the decision to offload the conglomerate's entire Nvidia stake, saying he "was crying" over parting with the shares. 

Speaking at a forum in Tokyo Monday, Son addressed SoftBank's November disclosure that the firm had sold its holding in the American chip darling for $5.83 billion. 

According to Son, SoftBank wouldn't have made the move if it didn't need to bankroll its next artificial intelligence investments, including a big bet on OpenAI and data center projects. 

"I don't want to sell a single share. I just had more need for money to invest in OpenAI and other projects, Son said during the FII Priority Asia forum. "I was crying to sell Nvidia shares."

Son's comments are consistent with what analysts and other Softbank executives said in November, describing the sale as part of broader efforts to bolster SoftBank Vision Fund's AI war chest. 

SoftBank has doubled down on its AI plans this year with a series of projects, including work on Stargate Project data centers and the acquisition of U.S. chip designer Ampere Computing.

The Japanese giant could also "potentially" increase its investment in OpenAI depending on the performance of the ChatGPT maker and the valuation of further rounds, a person familiar with the matter previously told CNBC.

Earlier this year, Son said that SoftBank was "all in" on OpenAI and predicted the AI startup would one day become the most valuable company in the world. 

So far, that bet has reaped some dividends, with SoftBank reporting last month that its second-quarter net profit more than doubled to 2.5 trillion yen ($16.6 billion), driven by valuation gains in its OpenAI holdings.

However, SoftBank's massive AI bets come amid growing fears and jitters in markets about a potential AI bubble. 

In his Monday talk, Son also pushed back against these concerns, arguing that those who talk about an AI bubble are "not smart enough."

He predicted that "super [artificial] intelligence" and AI robots will generate at least 10% of global gross domestic product over the long term, which he said would outweigh trillions of dollars of investment into the technology.

If you haven't signed up yet, time is running out to jump on the incredible Starz Cyber Monday deal. With so many different streaming services vying for viewers' attention, it stands out by being a spectacular value, knocking other competitor deals out of the park. 

For a limited time, a full year of Starz is only $12 — almost the price of one month's subscription. Not ready for the commitment? Don't fret; you can also get your first three months for $3 each, though the annual plan is the clear winner. Both offers feature ad-free access to the vast Starz library, making signing up an easy decision.

For even more sales, check out our guides to the best Cyber Monday streaming deals and general Cyber Monday deals roundup across all categories.

Though it has a vast library of genres to enjoy, Starz is especially great for fans of heart-pounding action, steamy drama, and period pieces. Its list of exclusives includes beloved series like "BMF," "Power Book IV: Force," "The Couple Next Door," and "Outlander" (as well as its recent prequel spinoff, "Outlander: Blood of My Blood").

Fans of movies can find exciting releases rotating in and out, including "The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare," "Ballerina," "Borderlands," "Hustlers," and the first two films in the "Now You See Me" series.

When compared to other streaming services, you may find Starz lacking in some genres (like horror, reality, or international content) and TV shows outside its own programming. However, when you factor in the cost — $3 a month or $12 for a whole year — it's a low-consequence subscription. Even if you were to only watch one movie a month, you'd be getting your money's worth when compared to digital rentals.


                      STARZ offers blockbuster movies and popular original series like Outlander, Party Down, and Power. This deal on the annual plan makes the service incredibly affordable, and even better, it comes with zero ads.
                    


                      STARZ is the streaming home of Outlander, Party Down, and tons of blockbuster movies. The app is one of the cheaper ad-free streaming services out there, but it also frequently offers impressive deals throughout the year.
                    

You have a lot to choose from when watching Starz, but the service excels particularly in period dramas, action films, and crime series. Here's a list of some of the platform's most popular highlights:

 Stocks advanced Tuesday, a day after the three major equities indexes ended their runs of five consecutive winning sessions.


 The tech-heavy Nasdaq, blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, and benchmark S&P 500 were up a respective 0.7%, 0.4%, and 0.3% in recent trading. Yesterday, the indexes closed lower as the final trading month of the year began, with shares of big tech and cryptocurrency-tied firms falling amid risk-off sentiment. 


 Bitcoin was trading around $92,000, up sharply from its overnight low of below $85,500. Yesterday, the largest cryptocurrency suffered its worst day since March, tumbling from around $91,000 and weighing on crypto-tied stocks Strategy (MSTR), MARA Holdings (MARA), Coinbase Global (COIN), and Robinhood Markets (HOOD). They all rose between roughly 4% and 8% Tuesday.


 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed around 4.09% after surging yesterday from Friday's close of 4.01%. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the performance of the dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, ticked higher to 99.45.


 WTI crude futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, slipped 0.6% to around $59 per barrel, and gold futures fell more than 1% to $4,225 per ounce.


 Nvidia (NVDA) shares, which advanced 1.7% Monday after it announced an expanded partnership with and $2 billion investment in Synopsys (SNPS), rose 1% further Tuesday. Most of the other Magnificent Seven large-cap technology firms also were slightly higher.


 Boeing (BA) shares soared 9% to lead the S&P 500 and Dow after CFO Jay Malave said at a conference that the plane maker expects 737 and 787 deliveries will increase in 2026.


 Shares of MongoDB (MDB) and Credo Technology Group Holding (CRDO) surged 23% and 16%, respectively, after each posted quarterly results that easily topped analysts' estimates. CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) were up about 2% ahead of their respective quarterly results after the closing bell.


 Elsewhere, Costco Wholesale (COST) stock little changed after the retailer sued the Trump administration over its tariffs; shares of Moderna (MRNA) and Shopify (SHOP) were down less than 1% and up roughly 6% after they led S&P 500 and Nasdaq decliners, respectively, on Monday; and Bayer closed up nearly 12% in Frankfurt trading after U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer supported the German agricultural company's push for the Supreme Court to review its Roundup weedkiller case.


Instacart Parent's Stock Falls as Amazon Tests 30-Minute Deliveries

 Amazon (AMZN) is rolling out "ultra-fast" deliveries in Seattle and Philadelphia. The news is affecting shares of Instacart parent Maplebear (CART).


 Shares of Maplebear were down 4% in recent trading after Amazon announced in a blog post that it's "now testing an ultra-fast delivery offering of the items customers want and need most urgently in parts of Seattle and Philadelphia. Amazon Now brings thousands of household essential items and groceries to customers' doorsteps in about 30 minutes or less."


Yuki Iwamura / Bloomberg via Getty Images

 The e-commerce giant added that Amazon Prime members will receive "discounted delivery fees starting at just $3.99 per order (vs. $13.99 for non-Prime customers)," and that a "small basket fee of $1.99 will apply to orders below $15."


 Amazon shares, which ticked 0.5% higher, are up 7% this year. Maplebear shares are fractionally lower in 2025.


Mark Your Calendar: Some People Will Receive Two Social Security Payments in December

 The Social Security Administration distributes benefits to almost 74 million people each month. Here is when to expect yours in December.


 Payments are primarily distributed according to beneficiaries' birth dates. However, for those who began receiving retirement, spousal, or survivor benefits before May 1997, they typically receive their payments on the 3rd of every month.


 Supplemental Security Income, a program that provides additional income for people with disabilities and adults aged 65 and older with limited or no income, is distributed separately from Social Security benefits at the beginning of every month.


 In some cases, when the beginning of the month coincides with a weekend or holiday, SSI benefits will be distributed in the preceding month. Due to government holidays in December, Supplemental Security Income recipients will receive two checks before the end of the year.

Signet Jewelers Stock Falls on Soft Guidance

 Shares of Signet Jewelers (SIG) fell 4% Tuesday afternoon after the parent of Kay Jewelers, Zales, and Jared issued weaker-than-expected current-quarter projections.


 Signet expects fiscal 2026 fourth-quarter sales of $2.24 billion to $2.37 billion, while analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for $2.38 billion. The company also sees same-store sales between a 5% year-over-year decline and a gain of 0.5%, while analysts were expecting an increase of 1.15%.

 In addition, Signet's projections for adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA were weaker than consensus.


 Signet's third-quarter adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share and sales of $1.39 billion were better than analysts expected.


 Despite today's declines, shares of Signet are up about 14% this year.


Top Stock Movers Now: Boeing, Intel, Sandisk, and More

 Major U.S. equities indexes gained ground on Tuesday, with tech stocks trending higher after a day of declines on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and benchmark S&P 500 gained 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, and the tech-centric Nasdaq rose 0.4%.


 Boeing (BA) shares surged 8%, the leading gainers on the S&P 500 after the plane maker's new CFO said at a conference held by UBS that its plan to ramp up production after safety issues substantially slowed production last year are going according to schedule, and said Boeing expects to generate positive free cash flow next year after burning through billions in the last two years.


 Intel (INTC) stock rose 7% as the chipmaker announced plans to invest about $200 million to increase its manufacturing footprint in Malaysia. The stock is also extending a rally that was sparked Friday by reports that Apple (AAPL) could be the company's next big customer.

 Shares of database software maker MongoDB (MDB) popped nearly 25% a day after the company's latest quarterly results easily topped estimates as it also lifted forecasts for the full year, a month after appointing a new CEO.

Costco Is Suing the Trump Administration—Here's Why

 Warehouse retail giant Costco Wholesale (COST) has joined the list of companies looking for a refund on tariffs.


 The company filed a lawsuit against U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Trump administration on Friday. In the Court of International Trade, Costco said that it would seek a refund of the tariffs it has paid on imports in the last several months if the Supreme Court finds Trump's tariffs unconstitutional.


Kevin Carter / Getty Images

 Costco did not specify in the filing how much it has paid in tariffs, but executives have said in earnings calls that the company was working with its suppliers to minimize the impact and that it would work to keep prices as low as it could.


 In its complaint, Costco is requesting that the trade court find the tariffs are invalid, prevent CBP from collecting further tariff payments, and guarantee a refund of the tariffs the company has paid and those it may pay before the case is decided.

Boeing Stock Powers S&P 500, Dow Higher After CFO Comments on Deliveries, Cash Flow

 Comments by Boeing (BA) CFO Jay Malave at a conference Tuesday morning are lifting the company's shares and major indexes.


 Boeing stock soared 8% to lead the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average after Malave said at the UBS Global Industrials and Transportation Conference that "we expect absolutely deliveries to be up (in 2026) in both cases, both 737 and both 787."


 In addition, Malave said that "we absolutely expect to grow year-over-year in cash flow," adding that "what we expect anyway is in the low single digits in terms of positive free cash flow, which I think is pretty substantial growth year-over-year."


 Including Tuesday's sharp gains, Boeing shares have risen about 14% this year, slightly better than the Dow's advance but slightly worse than the S&P 500's.

Here's Why the Maker of Roundup Weedkiller's Stock Is Surging Today

 Shares of pharmaceutical conglomerate Bayer are surging 13% on their home exchange in Germany after the U.S. Solicitor General supported its efforts to have the Supreme Court review prior rulings on whether Roundup weedkiller, produced by Bayer-owned Monsanto, needs a cancer risk warning label.


 The solicitor general said in a Monday filing that the Environmental Protection Agency has for years said that glyphosate, a chemical used in Roundup, is "not likely to be carcinogenic in humans," and said the Food and Drug Administration has approved "hundreds of labels for Roundup" that did not include any information about cancer.


Kevin Carter / Getty Images

 Bayer has argued that since federal agencies have determined the chemical doesn't require a cancer warning, customers should not be able to sue for violating state laws regarding a failure to warn customers about cancer risks. Bayer said most of the tens of thousands of outstanding lawsuits are "grounded in failure-to-warn theories," meaning they would be invalidated by a ruling that Bayer isn't bound by state failure-to-warn laws.


 Bayer said it welcomes the support. It said a ruling from the Supreme Court on whether companies can be sued for violating state laws when complying with a federal agency's determination of a chemical's safety would provide clarity for the company and customers. Bayer said it "continues to advance its multi-pronged strategy designed to significantly contain the litigation by the end of 2026."


 Monsanto was acquired by Bayer in 2018 for $63 billion, and a California jury held Monsanto liable just months after the deal was closed for failing to warn about Roundup's potential cancer risks after a groundskeeper was diagnosed with cancer.

How You Should Tackle 'Travel Tuesday': Expert Views on the Promotion

 You may still be settling in from a Thanksgiving trip, but experts say it's smart to start planning your next getaway.


 Nearly all major airlines and several hotels will offer bargain rates tomorrow in what's become known as "Travel Tuesday". Travel companies now extend more deals on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving than on Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined, according to Hopper, a travel booking app.


 The industrywide promotion grew out of an annual deal Hopper launched in 2017, and has become a bonafide opportunity for bargain-hunting, said Clint Henderson, managing editor of The Points Guy, a travel site.


 Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images

 "It's probably the best time of the year to book cheap flights," said Henderson, later explaining that he initially saw Travel Tuesday as a marketing move. “I used to tell people, ‘Don't bother,' but now I'm all in.”


 Travel Tuesday airfare deals often promote winter travel, and only apply to flights departing in January or February. Warm destinations are widely touted. For instance, Delta Air Lines (DAL) is selling roundtrip tickets from New York City to the Dominican Republic, Cayman Islands and St. Thomas for less than $300.


 But domestic airfare may be particularly inexpensive—Alaska Air Group (ALK) is promoting regional one-way tickets for as low as $29, and trips from California to Hawaii for $99, according to its website.

Credo Technology Stock Pops on Better-Than-Expected Results, Guidance

 Shareholders of Credo Technology Group Holding (CRDO) stock evidently were quite pleased with the company's results and current-quarter projections.


 Credo stock surged 17% before the bell Tuesday, a day after the high-speed connectivity solutions firm reported fiscal 2026 second-quarter results and issued third-quarter guidance well above analysts' expectations.


 San Jose, Calif.-based Credo posted Q2 adjusted earnings of $0.67 per share on revenue that skyrocketed 272% year-over-year to $268.0 million. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected $0.49 and $234.8 million, respectively.


 For the current quarter, Credo expects revenue between $335.0 million and $345.0 million, well above the consensus $247.8 million.


 Shares of Credo—which says it provides "reliable, energy-efficient, system-level connectivity solutions for the next generation of AI-driven applications, cloud computing and hyperscale networks"—entered Tuesday having more than doubled year-to-date.

MongoDB Stock Soars After Results, Outlook Easily Top Estimates

 MongoDB's (MDB) fiscal 2026 third-quarter results easily topped analysts' expectations. So did the database software maker's guidance.


 Shares of MongoDB soared 23% in premarket trading Tuesday, a day after the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share on revenue that increased 19% year-over-year to $628.3 million. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha had expected $0.82 and $594.3 million, respectively.


 For the current quarter, the New York-based company sees adjusted EPS of $1.44 to $1.48 on revenue of $665 million to $670 million, both well above consensus estimates.


 "Q3 was an exceptional quarter," MongoDB CEO CJ Desai said. "Existing customers are expanding with us and net-new customer additions continue to show strength. Companies across industries and geographies are choosing MongoDB because we provide a unified data platform that powers mission-critical workloads today and also positions them to capitalize on the emerging AI platform shift."


 Entering Tuesday, MongoDB shares have risen more than 40% this year.

Pair traders hunting for an edge might want to focus on a little-known gauge tied to bitcoin BTC$92,090.61 and the S&P 500.

That gauge is the spread between Volmex's BVIV – the 30-day implied volatility index for BTC – and its S&P 500 counterpart, the VIX index. The spread has started to widen again, suggesting BTC volatility is expected to outpace equity market risk.

Implied volatility is influenced by demand for options or hedging instruments."When the BVIV-VIX spread widens, it typically signals that markets expect higher volatility in crypto than in equities," Volmex's Founder Cole Kennelly told CoinDesk. "Crypto options markets adjust more rapidly to liquidity and macro catalysts, so implied volatility often moves ahead of traditional markets."

The spread recently broke out of a months-long range play between 20.000 and 32.000 and pierced the downtrend from March 2024's peak. These patterns suggest that BTC is likely to see more volatility than the S&P 500 in the coming days.

Prospects of BTC volatility becoming relatively richer compared to the S&P 500 may draw pair traders to consider opposing volatility bets in BTC and the S&P 500.

"When the BVIV–VIX spread widens meaningfully, some traders view it as a relative value setup: crypto implied volatility has cheapened or richened relative to equity volatility. This type of view is typically expressed through multi-legged cross-asset volatility trades rather than a simple directional position," Kennelly explained. 

Trading volatility, a capital-intensive strategy, involves betting on price swings rather than direction, typically through non-directional options or volatility futures. 

It goes without saying that these strategies are risky, like other plays, and require constant monitoring of positions and ample capital, which makes them suitable for institutions.

Bitcoin BTC$91.754,49 surged back above $90,000 during Tuesday's U.S. morning hours, erasing most of its steep plunge from Sunday to Monday to below $84,000. The largest cryptocurrency was recently trading at $91,180, up 8% over the past 24 hours, helping lifting the broader digital asset markets.

Ethereum's ether ETH$3020,65 bounced above $3,000, gaining 9% during the same period. Large-cap altcoins also followed the advance: XRP$2,1743, Solana's SOL SOL$139,68, DOGE$0.1464 were up 7%–10%, recovering from their recent lows.

The gains occurred as $11 trillion asset management giant Vanguard dropped its longstanding fatwa against crypto and will now allow its clients to have access to digital asset ETFs. Alongside, Bank of America has given the okay for its wealth managers to recommend a 1%-4% allocation to the spot bitcoin ETFs.

Mark Connors, founder and chief macro strategist of bitcoin investment advisory Risk Dimensions and former global head of risk advisory at Credit Suisse warns that a rise in Japan's 10-year yield could pull capital away from global markets, with crypto — especially bitcoin — being hit hardest due to its proximity to Asian capital flows and exposure to leverage. Binance, which handles nearly half of all crypto volume and allows leverage of up to 50x, is particularly vulnerable to yen and yuan volatility.

Connors also pointed out that bitcoin appears to be leading the S&P 500 lower. That pattern could continue until both the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan hold their policy meetings later this month. If markets weaken further, he expects some form of intervention, as has often happened during periods of stress in recent years.

Still, not all signals point to weakness. Jasper De Maere, desk strategist at Wintermute, said bitcoin derivatives show a “clear lean toward bullish, short-vol behaviour.” Traders are selling downside puts around the $80,000–$85,000 level while selectively buying upside further out.

“The mix suggests a market that treats $80,000–85,000 as supported and is comfortable leaning long into year-end while earning carry on the way,” De Maere said. In other words, despite near-term pressure, traders appear positioned for a recovery.

The Stable.com platform integrates non-custodial exchange with Unlimit's global payments infrastructure so that users can swap and off-ramp across all major stablecoins, the company said in a Tuesday (Dec. 2) press release.

The platform enables gasless, zero-commission conversions across all leading stablecoins; provides native off-ramp of stablecoins into local currencies worldwide; and allows users to retain full control of their funds, according to the release.

“Stable.com leverages Unlimit's unrivalled global payments infrastructure, developed over the past 16 years, to seamlessly connect the world of DeFi with traditional finance,” Unlimit CEO and founder Kirill Eves said in the release. “Today, we empower the crypto industry to evolve, advance and unlock its full potential.”

Stablecoin adoption has set its sights beyond the cryptocurrency market liquidity for which it was used for years, aiming for potentially practical, real-world solutions, PYMNTS reported in March.

While stablecoins have become fundamental instruments in global trade, remittances and decentralized finance, each transaction involves a complex network of operational, technical and security frameworks, PYMNTS reported in May.

“The biggest problem in crypto is not adoption, it's the user experience,” Mesh CEO and co-founder Bam Azizi told PYMNTS at the time. “You need to make payments so simple that even a grandmother will use it one day, maybe without even knowing that the mechanism behind the scenes is a stablecoin … to do that, you need to do a lot of heavy lifting.”

Following the passage of new U.S. cryptocurrency legislation, the GENIUS Act, stablecoin payment volume ballooned to more than $10 billion in August, according to blockchain data provider Artemis Analytics.

That figure was up from $6 billion in February and more than twice the volume from August 2024. Artemis Analytics said stablecoin payments could reach $122 billion over a full year.

“It's well understood that stablecoins have graduated from merely being a tool used by crypto traders and exchanges to conveniently move money around without relying on banks, to a more widely used tool for consumer and enterprise payments,” the company said.

Crypto ETPs ended a four-week streak of losses, attracting over $1B in the last week of November, marking the first week in the green since October.

Although BTC products saw $464M in inflows, combined altcoin flows amounted to over $600M. 

In general, the market is moving further toward altcoins as Bitcoin struggles to maintain a solid price. In addition to tried-and-true coins, DeepSnitch AI, an early-stage presale, saw increased levels of activity as traders sought out high-upside opportunities. 

Raising $650K in record timing, combined with the strength of the underlying AI prediction and analytics suite, got many anticipating 100x gains and aping into DeepSnitch AI as one of the best altcoins to buy in Q4. 

According to a December 1 report by CoinShares, cryptocurrency ETPs logged $1.07B total inflows in a week, ending a four-week red streak that amounted to $5.5B. 

Bitcoin ETPs led the charge with $464M in gains, followed by Ethereum with $309M and XRP with $289M. Although generally bullish, BTC and Ethereum products are still in the red on a monthly basis, which is a stark contrast to XRP with $790M. 

The likely reason for the resurgence was restored market sentiment following Bitcoin's push above $90K and optimism over potential Fed interest cuts later in December. 

Unfortunately for traders, the trend didn't stick, and Bitcoin dropped below $86K on December 1. 

As predicting Bitcoin's short-term trajectory gets more challenging, many retail traders are looking for the best altcoins to buy in Q4 in anticipation of a Santa rally and a more confident rally in December. 

Although altcoins still haven't had their opportunity to shine, new presales, including DeepSnitch AI, have proved their resilience against wider market currents. Case in point: DeepSnitch AI raised nearly $650K while the market was going through a downturn. 

As a presale that prioritizes efficiency in development, DeepSnitch AI's prediction and analytics suite, running on five AI agents, is nearly complete. The two core agents are already running in an analytics layer, allowing them to track whale wallets, predict FUD storms, anticipate sentiment shifts, and scan tokens for rug pull risks.

While these functions will be available to early investors shortly, many traders are also aping the project for its upside potential. 

With a price of  $0.02577, DSNT is not only one of the most undervalued altcoins at the moment, but it is also the most affordable entry into the expanding AI market. Since DeepSnitch AI has mass appeal, traders expect widespread adoption, which could help the project reach a similar level of success as FET or RENDER. 

If the 100x projection comes true, DeepSnitch AI could yield $50K gains on a small investment of $500. 

DeepSnitch AI is expected to launch in January, and while no official confirmation has been made, the community anticipates a MEXC or a Bybit listing. 

According to CoinMarketCap, PI traded in the $0.2200 area on December 1, showing a noticeable downturn. 

If the December 1 performance continues, PI could drop to $0.18 before making a slow recovery back to $0.2200. 

However, a bullish scenario is also possible, especially if the project achieves new milestones or announces a major exchange listing. In this case, PI could push past $0.2600, followed by a massive surge toward $0.4800.

DOGE traded in the $0.13 area on December 1, according to CoinMarketCap. 

Even though the situation at the beginning of the month looked grim, DOGE could realistically regain its status as one of the most affordable altcoins set for growth. 

To restore DOGE's prospects, the coin must regain its 20-day EMA of $0.15, which will signal a comeback and allow the close above $0.17. If this move goes by smoothly, DOGE could eventually surge toward $0.29.

Alternatively, if sales continue, DOGE will lose the $0.13, which could lead to a massive crash to $0.10. 

With altcoins extending their weekly wins on the institutional investment scene, the time is nigh to find the best altcoins to buy to capitalize on a slight alt shift in Q4. 

Because it raised $650K and many traders are betting on its 100x narrative, the underlying prediction and analytics solution only serves to strengthen DeepSnitch AI's long-term prospects – after all, can so many traders be wrong? 

Jump in the DeepSnitch AI presale, and catch up with the latest community updates on X and Telegram. 

DeepSnitch AI, XRP, Ethereum, and Dogecoin stand out due to recent ETP inflows, strong fundamentals, and renewed market interest.

Bitcoin's unstable short-term trend and renewed ETP inflows push traders toward altcoins with stronger momentum and better short-term upside.

DeepSnitch AI raised $650K during a downturn, offers a nearly complete AI analytics suite, and carries a widely discussed 100x upside potential. Most importantly, the solution is already operational and will be made available to investors soon.

"The Big Short" investor Michael Burry has said the hype around bitcoin is getting out of hand.

Burry called the blockchain-based currency the "tulip bulb of our time" on a podcast hosted by "The Big Short" author Michael Lewis, which aired on Tuesday, referencing the hype-driven tulip bubble crash in the 1600s.

"I think that bitcoin at $100,000 is the most ridiculous thing," said Burry, who described the cryptocurrency as "not worth anything." 

"It's worse than a tulip bulb, because this has enabled so much criminal activity to go deep under," Burry told Lewis, who wrote about the investor's famous bet against the housing market in the run-up to the financial crash in his 2010 book.

Bitcoin was up around 1.5% early Tuesday at about $88,700. The digital currency hit a record high of over $120,000 in October but has fallen more than 30% since then.

Burry's attack on bitcoin is the latest salvo in the famed short-seller's action-packed return to the public sphere.

After years of silence, Burry disclosed big bets against market darlings Nvidia and Palantir last month. The former hedge fund boss also called Tesla "ridiculously overvalued" and has issued regular warnings about the AI bubble on X and his newly-launched Substack.

It's not the first time Burry, who was played by Christian Bale in a 2015 movie adaptation of Lewis' book, has been critical of crypto.

In 2021, Burry warned that although he believed the reasons for bitcoin's existence were "relevant," the cryptocurrency was a "speculative bubble" that posed more risk than opportunity.

"If you do not know how much leverage is involved in the run-up, you may not know enough to own it," he wrote in a since-deleted tweet.

He cannot be both SAPM and chairman of the regulatory authority

Bilal Bin Saqib, Pakistan's Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain, has resigned from his post as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Blockchain and Crypto in order to comply with bureaucratic regulations, The Express Tribune has learnt.

Rumours that the crypto ministry was shutting down started circulating on WhatsApp on Tuesday. "The crypto developments for Pakistan are still ongoing and the minister is speaking at Binance Blockchain Week on Wednesday, December 3, in Dubai," said a staffer informed of the changes.

Saqib had to resign because the Rules of Business 1973 say that you cannot be an SAPM if you are the chairman of a statutory regulatory authority such as the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority.



A copy of the resignation was acquired by The Express Tribune.

Saqib was appointed Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Blockchain and Crypto with the status of Minister of State in May 2025. He has been leading Pakistan's national blockchain strategy and helped with the establishment of the regulatory authority of which he is currently chairman.

The Pakistan Crypto Council, formally established earlier this year, continues to operate as a national force for crypto policy, innovation, youth empowerment, and international engagement in crypto and blockchain.

Pakistan is home to over 50 million crypto users, with an annual trading volume exceeding $300 billion. The country consistently ranks in the top 5 globally for crypto adoption, reflecting its strong grassroots engagement with digital assets. Out of a population of 240 million, 70% of Pakistanis are under the age of 30.

Pakistan boasts a highly favorable demographic for widespread crypto adoption, making it one of the most promising emerging markets for blockchain and digital finance innovation. Pakistan is also the third-largest freelancer market in the world, showcasing its dynamic and entrepreneurial digital workforce.

Who is Bilal Bin Saqib?

A London-based entrepreneur, Bilal Bin Saqib has been at the forefront of digital innovation and social impact. Recognized by King Charles III, the late Queen Elizabeth II, and the Mayor of London, Saqib's work spans across blockchain technology, crypto investments, and social entrepreneurship.

In 2023, he was awarded an MBE (Member of the British Empire) for his humanitarian efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which he led the One Million Meals initiative, delivering over 100,000 meals to NHS staff and vulnerable populations across the UK.

His academic credentials include a Master's in Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship from the London School of Economics (LSE). He also received the 1632nd Points of Light Award, a recognition granted by the British Prime Minister to individuals making outstanding contributions to their communities.

Beyond his work in fintech, Saqib co-founded Tayaba, a social enterprise focused on Pakistan's water crisis, introducing the H2O Wheel, an innovative water transportation device designed to ease the burden on rural communities.

The term Digital Asset Treasury companies, known as DATs or DATCOs, has emerged as one of the biggest buzzwords in the digital currency industry this year, providing investors with a novel way to play crypto — but with new risks. 

A DAT is effectively a publicly-listed entity that holds cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ether and provides investors with exposure to the underlying digital currency. DATs aim to outperform the price action of the cryptocurrency that they hold. 

But with crypto markets seeing a big plunge in recent weeks, the strategies of DATs has come under scrutiny and raised concerns about whether they could add further pressure to an already weak crypto market.

A Digital Asset Treasury is a type of company that buys and holds cryptocurrencies directly on its balance sheet. Investors can buy shares of that entity to get exposure to the underlying digital asset.

The original — and one of the biggest DATs — is Michael Saylor's Strategy which began buying bitcoin in 2020 and has done so ever since. 

But more recently, there has been an explosion of this type of vehicle. In 2021, fewer than 10 companies held bitcoin in their treasuries, according to DLA Piper. That number has since jumped to 190 companies, while another 10 to 20 firms are focused on alternative digital assets as of September, DLA Piper said.

These DATs hold around $100 billion worth of cryptocurrencies combined, according to data from The Block.

The DAT explosion this year has been driven by buoyant crypto markets and more favorable regulation in the United States toward the industry.

But their growth has also come at a time when it's easier than ever to buy cryptocurrencies directly or invest in the asset via other regulated entities like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 

DATs are intended to outperform the underlying assets which they hold. They can achieve this through various strategies to maximise returns. In contrast, ETFs effectively hold the cryptocurrency passively and issue shares backed one-to-one with the actual asset.

DATs can also provide regulatory certainty to investors, according to a note from Macquarie published last week. They "package crypto assets within SEC-regulated securities," the investment bank's analysts said. "This eliminates regulatory ambiguity and ensures the same public reporting, disclosures, and investor protections as any public equity."

Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told CNBC that DATs also offer an option to "institutional and professional investors with regulatory, fiduciary or operational constraints that make direct token ownership or crypto ETFs unsuitable."

DATs offer unique capabilities that ETFs cannot, employing a range of strategies to enhance investor returns.

To assess the performance of these DATs, a metric known as market net asset value, or mNAV, is closely watched. It compares a company's enterprise value to the value of its digital asset holdings. It can show how much of a premium investors are assigning to a DAT, with an mNAV over 1 signifying a premium.

DATs can use an at-the-market (ATM) equity program to increase their crypto holdings. When its share price exceeds the net asset value of the crypto holdings, a DAT can issue more shares at a premium and therefore raise cash. That allows the DAT to fund the purchase of more crypto — as has been the case for Strategy.

"This creates a crypto-per-share accretive feedback loop: the issuer raises equity, accumulates tokens, and sees its NAV per share increase, further increasing the premium, representing accretive dilution," Macquarie explained. 

Staking is another strategy that is employed by DATs. It allows a holder of cryptocurrency to earn yield, similar to interest, on their assets. To stake, an investor effectively locks up their crypto on a blockchain to help the network run better. In return, the investor receives a return in the form of more crypto. However, unstaking crypto can take several weeks, which may limit ETFs and similar products from fully embracing staking, given their need for liquidity and stable asset values.

Staking creates free cash flow that "can be redeployed into mergers and acquisitions (M&A), token purchases, on-chain opportunities, or shareholder distributions," ARK Invest said in a note last month. 

As the market advances, there are likely to be new trading strategies employed by DATs. 

DATs have come into focus amid recent crypto market turmoil, with bitcoin well off its all-time high. 

As crypto prices fall, mNAV may fall under 1, meaning companies are trading at a discount to their crypto holdings. This can create a number of issues. 

"When the crypto market pulls back, DATCOs face pressure and they have a limited menu of realistic responses," Alexander said. 

"Some may double‑down and hold, viewing the drop as a buying opportunity for future appreciation. Others may need liquidity, especially those that used financing (e.g. debt, convertible bonds, share issuance) which can force them to sell part of their token holdings."

And an mNAV premium is key for the DAT market.

"The viability of DATCOs is closely tied to the persistence of an equity premium to NAV. If this premium erodes or reverses to a discount, the model faces significant challenges," Macquarie analysts said.

The investment bank also notes that if a DAT's stock price falls or near NAV, equity issuance becomes dilutive, meaning "new shares issued no longer increase crypto per share, but rather dilute existing shareholders' exposure. This can break the self-reinforcing cycle that sustains the premium."

Meanwhile, the explosion in the number of DATs and growing interest from investors creates its own risks.

"The sector is becoming increasingly crowded, with capital flowing in according to an established playbook. This influx, however, increases structural fragility. Should any of the key variables - investor sentiment, crypto prices, or capital market liquidity - fall, the DATCO model could unravel," Macquarie said.

Strategy has sought to protect itself against the downturn. On Monday, the company announced a $1.44 billion U.S. dollar reserve that was funded by the sale of more stock. The reserve is designed to support the payment of dividends and service debt, Strategy said.

James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said other DATs may follow Strategy's decision to dilute shareholders.

"It is not particularly confidence-inspiring: it highlights both their dependence on, and their expectation of, a recovery in token prices," Butterfill told CNBC.

"We do expect token prices to rebound, particularly if the Federal Reserve delivers a December rate cut, which should help these companies avoid forced liquidations. Nevertheless, the episode underscores the inherent fragility of the DAT model."

If mNAVs continue to fall and DATs don't have the means to keep afloat, they may turn to selling digital tokens which could put pressure on crypto markets.

"As token prices drop, even the highest‑profile DATs have begun scaling back. This can amplify volatility in the broader crypto markets, because DATs are large holders: their sales, even if staggered, increase supply into already weakened liquidity conditions," Alexander said. 

For now, DATs' digital currency holdings account for less than 1% of the total crypto market. But as their influence potentially grows, they may have more of an impact on braoder markets.

"As DATCOs scale, their market influence grows; an unwind could weaken a major tailwind for crypto, namely the normalization of digital assets on corporate balance sheets," Macquarie said. "This, in turn, could dampen public equity interest in digital asset exposure, slow crypto ETF inflows, and pressure cryptocurrency prices."

The DAT space is currently in a bubble, according to Sussex University's Alexander.

"The DATCO model seems to have attracted many entrants driven more by marketing, hype and easy capital than by durable business fundamentals," she told CNBC. 

CoinShares' Butterfill said the "bubble has already decisively burst," with many DATs now trading at mNAVs below 1 and a "clear signal that the market fears" these companies will be forced to sell their digital assets. 

However, both experts said DATs may evolve in the future.

"Over the longer term, investors are likely to demand a more measured approach," Butterfill said. 

"Tolerance for shareholder dilution and for extremely high token concentrations without accompanying revenue streams will diminish. The recent frenzy of token accumulation has, in many ways, undermined the original intent of the DAT concept: credible global companies seeking diversification from fiat-currency and depreciation risks."

Alexander said that these digital asset treasury firms may also begin to diversify their holdings into non-crypto assets too. 

"I believe those that pivot toward operations such as yield‑generation through staking, increasing the diversification of their tokens, and mix with token traditional assets like cash or T-bills, may survive as legitimate digital‑asset infrastructure players," Alexander said.

Colle AI, the multichain AI-driven NFT creation platform, unveiled its new Logic-Free Creator Assembly system, an adaptive composition engine designed to eliminate the need for manual workflow construction when generating blockchain-ready digital assets. The system introduces a next-generation assembly layer that automatically interprets creator intent and instantly forms complete asset structures—allowing users to move from idea to ready-to-publish output in seconds. This breakthrough further strengthens Colle AI's position as a leader in ultra-fast, AI-powered creative infrastructure built for multichain environments.

The Logic-Free Creator Assembly system works by analyzing prompts, stylistic directives, object relationships, and visual context without requiring creators to design multi-step processes or configure assembly logic. Instead, Colle AI's intelligence orchestrates every stage of asset construction—from foundational structure to visual alignment, metadata preparation, and cross-chain formatting—entirely in the background. This advancement removes friction for artists, brands, and developers who rely on fast iteration cycles, enabling them to bypass complex tools and focus solely on creative direction while the platform handles structural decisions automatically.

Integrated with Colle AI's existing multichain pipelines, the new logic-free layer ensures each asset is instantly compatible with the technical requirements of chains such as Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, BNB Chain, and the XRP Ledger. The system dynamically adapts composition outputs to meet chain-specific metadata and formatting standards, ensuring assets produced without logic assembly remain robust, consistent, and ready for deployment. “Logic-Free Creator Assembly represents a major shift in how creators engage with AI and NFT production,” said J. King Kasr, Chief Scientist at KaJ Labs. “By removing workflow construction entirely, Colle AI gives users the most direct path from imagination to multichain deployment.”

As Colle AI continues to evolve its intelligent creative infrastructure, the introduction of this assembly layer supports its broader mission of delivering adaptive, high-speed AI systems that transform how artists and innovators build across Web3. The Logic-Free Creator Assembly system lays the groundwork for future enhancements in generative design, modular automation, and real-time multichain publishing—bringing the platform closer to its vision of frictionless, intelligence-driven digital creation.

The Eurosystem is to launch a call for expression of interest during the first quarter of 2026 to invite European payment service providers (PSPs) to participate in a digital euro pilot in 2027.

The announcement follows the European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council's recent decision to progress to the next phase of the digital euro project. A final decision on whether to issue a digital euro – a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for the 20-member eurozone – and on what date, will only be taken once legislation has been adopted.

The pilot is expected to last for 12 months ‘with a view to validating the technical, functional and operational readiness' of the digital euro, according to a ECB press announcement (28 November), which states that companies participating will not be remunerated.

‘These exercises will involve validating digital transaction processes in a controlled environment with a limited number of participants,' the ECB explains. ‘These digital transactions will be designed to replicate the digital euro's technical design but they will not have legal tender status.'

The pilot will involve ‘only Eurosystem staff, selected merchants that already provide everyday services on the office premises of the ECB and of euro area national central banks (for example, cafeterias or restaurants), as well as selected e-commerce,' its announcement continues. Eurosystem staff will have the opportunity to make payments from person-to-person (both online and offline) and from person-to-business (both at a physical point of sale and in e-commerce).

The ECB announced on 30 October that it was moving to the next phase of its development of a digital euro and targeting 2029 for potential issuance.

Under an assumption that European co-legislators will adopt a regulation on the establishment of the digital euro next year (2026), a pilot exercise and ‘initial transactions' could take place as of ‘mid-2027,' the Frankfurt-headquartered authority announced.

The Eurosystem – which comprises the ECB and the national central banks of the 20 European Union (EU) member states whose currency is the euro – ‘should then be ready for a potential first issuance of the digital euro during 2029,' it said.

The Governing Council gave the widely expected nod to proceed with the next phase following European leaders' request to accelerate progress on the initiative.

A two-year digital euro ‘preparation phase', which itself followed a two-year ‘investigation phase', has just been completed.

These earlier phases already involved substantial engagement with the private sector, for example through an ‘innovation platform' for experimentation with market participants (now in a second round of experimentation); and, more significantly, through the selection of providers for digital euro ‘components and related services' – in a 2 October announcement, the ECB named the companies selected (through a procurement process) as ‘first-ranked' providers for ‘framework agreements' in five activity fields. The agreements, which effectively set the terms for potential future work, have a total estimated spend of €432.1m (about £377m) and a potential maximum spend of €1.164 billion (just over £1 billion).

The ECB provides a seven-page ‘Declaration of intent to launch a call for expression of interest' document in which it describes participation in the pilot activities as ‘a unique opportunity for PSPs to help shape the next generation of digital payments in Europe.'

‘The pool of selected payment service providers will need to ensure representative coverage of the euro area market in terms of size, geographical coverage and market reach,' the ECB states.

Selected payment service providers will collaborate with the Eurosystem to develop and test pilot payment use cases.

‘Selected participants will gain first-hand experience of a simulated digital euro ecosystem and their feedback will further shape its technical specifications,' the ECB states.

The pilot will have four main phases: ‘assessment', ‘preparation', ‘implementation' and ‘execution'.

It will cover four use cases: ‘online P2P [person-to-person] transactions using an alias or digital means of payment access number'; ‘offline P2P transactions with NFC [near-field communication]'; ‘online P2B [person-to-business] transactions with NFC at SoftPOS [Software Point-of-Sale]'; and ‘online e- and m-commerce [mobile commerce] transactions'.

In a separate development, the ECB Governing Council has recently decided to further advance ongoing initiatives to interlink the Eurosystem's TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) service with other fast payment systems globally.

The decision followed positive findings of exploratory work begun in October 2024 to connect TIPS with India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and with Nexus Global Payments – a multilateral payment scheme aiming to super-charge the speed of cross-border transactions.

More specifically, the Governing Council has decided to: start a ‘realisation phase' for interlinking TIPS with UPI while completing legal arrangements and technical implementation; and ‘continue exploring the feasibility of a potential connection to Nexus Global Payments while in parallel completing the necessary legal arrangements and agreements'.

The decision is ‘part of the Eurosystem's overall efforts to make it easier for businesses and consumers in Europe to send and receive payments to and from other countries, including remittances', the ECB said in an announcement (20 November).  

In September 2025 the Governing Council launched work to assess the feasibility of a connection between TIPS and the Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) instant payments system.

Tech stocks linked to Bitcoin staged a modest comeback in overnight trading, although it wasn't enough to wipe away the losses they suffered yesterday. The market remains on edge as Bitcoin has lost 21% over the past month. In recent days, it has stabilized at around $87K per coin and was up 0.72% today. Crypto trading platform Coinbase was down 4.76% yesterday but was up 1.37% in overnight trading, while Robinhood was down 4.09% yesterday and then crept up 0.63% this morning, premarket. But the elephant in the digital asset room is Michael Saylor's Strategy, the leading Bitcoin treasury company, whose stock market cap is now worth less than the Bitcoin it holds. It dropped 3.25% yesterday but was up 0.45% before the bell. Strategy's market cap was $50.6 billion at the time of writing, and its 650,000 Bitcoins were worth $56.7 billion. The key metric for Strategy, however, is its “mNAV” (multiple to net asset value), which is a ratio describing the company's theoretical enterprise value (currently $65.2 billion) to its Bitcoin holdings. That ratio was 1.15 this morning, meaning its enterprise value is worth 15% more than its Bitcoin.

However, if the mNAV falls below one, then Strategy faces a crisis: The reason for holding the stock vanishes, and no one will be likely to provide the company with more capital—a period of fierce selling could ensue.

The situation was made more tense after Strategy CEO Phong Le said on a podcast that the company would be willing to sell some of its Bitcoin in order to meet the dividend commitments on its debt and preferred shares. “Now, as we are looking at Bitcoin winter, as we see our mNAV compressing, my hope is our mNAV doesn't go below one,” he said. “But if we do, and we didn't have other access to capital, we would sell Bitcoin.” 

On Monday, the company published an investor presentation which confirmed (on page 11) that it will begin selling Bitcoin if the mNAV falls below one.

The statements were extraordinary because Saylor, the founder, has repeatedly said he would never sell. Strategy currently holds just over 3% of all Bitcoin. If it was forced to sell in order to raise cash, that too would likely start an avalanche. (The company did not immediately respond when contacted for comment.)

Traders betting on leveraged plays against Strategy have already been wiped out. Two exchange-traded funds, MSTX and MSTU, which offered double the returns of the underlying Strategy stock, have lost more than 80% of their value, according to Bloomberg. Together with a third, MSTP, they have lost $1.5 billion in value over the past month.

Strategy shares declined Tuesday after the company said it had created a $1.44 billion “U.S. dollar reserve” to fund its dividends, and had enough cash to survive the next 12 to 24 months, according to the Financial Times.

Some crypto investment experts have a negative outlook. Patrick Horsman, chief investment officer at BNB Plus, another crypto treasury company, told the Wall Street Journal, “I think we could see Bitcoin get all the way back to $60,000 … We don't think the pain is over.”

The crypto market failed to make a meaningful recovery on Tuesday as it continued to languish in "extreme fear" territory following a sell-off on Monday that appears to have eroded investor confidence.

Bitcoin traded around $87,000, down from last week's high of $92,350 as the broader market continued to exhibit weakness despite hopes that there would be a "Santa rally" in December.

The altcoin market wasn't looking much better. Several tokens posted losses of more than 5% over the past 24 hours, led by privacy coins.

Bitcoin has now retraced almost the entire Nov. 21-28 rally, underperforming U.S. equities. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 6.6% in the same period.

The ICO says around 90 percent of children in the UK play games on digital devices and 84 percent of parents are concerned about potential exposure to strangers or harmful content.

To address this, the ICO says it will review the top ten most popular mobile games, assessing their compliance with privacy settings, geolocation controls, and targeted advertising practices. The organization will also review any other privacy issues raised in the process.

“Children's online experiences are shaped not just by social media and video sharing platforms, but also by the games they play. Our early review suggests that many mobile games' design features can be especially intrusive, raising important questions about how these games are designed and experienced, and their adherence to the ICO's Children's code standards,” explains John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner.

“We're expanding our strategy to ensure that mobile games meet the same high standards of data protection we've driven across other platforms.”

The ICO previously announced its Children's Code Strategy, which has seen a number of social networks and video sharing platforms make changes to the way they manage data protection for children. 

The strategy has seen popular platforms introduce changes such as giving children private profiles by default, and restricting the visibility of child users.

Renowned investor and media personality Kevin O'Leary said Monday that altcoins are no longer bouncing back after market corrections, as investor attention is now solely on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH).

O'Leary said in an X post that investors have realized owning only the two coins is enough to capture 97.5% of all the cryptocurrency market's “alpha.”

“If you own those two, it doesn't matter what happens anywhere else because everything else is moving with a much higher  [volume] to the downside and not recovering anymore because they have no use case,” O'Leary, also known as “Mr Wonderful,” argued.

He added that, unlike previous corrections, altcoins in the current market haven't bounced back as expected.

Notably, CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index had a value of 23 as of this writing, indicating a “Bitcoin Season.” Altcoin Season typically happens if 75% of the top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin in the last 90 days.

On the other hand, the total market share of altcoins rose from 28.2% to 29.5%. At the same time, Bitcoin's dominance fell from 59.2% to 58.9%, while Ethereum's share shrank from 12.6% to 11.5%.

O'Leary's stance on the two blue-chip assets has been clear for some time. In September, he said that owning these two cryptocurrencies can capture the majority of the market's volatility and yield. He advised his followers to avoid chasing “irrelevant tokens.”

He also noted a shift in investment habits among Gen Zs. Earlier in August, he said that younger investors are purchasing Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside traditional stocks, a trend he did not see when he began investing.

Price Action: At the time of writing, BTC was exchanging hands at $86,961.70, up 0.94% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. ETH traded down 0.50% at $2,804.71 at last check.

This cell likes it hot. A tiny, single-celled amoeba that can thrive at temperatures that kill all other known complex life — organisms whose cells contain a nucleus and internal structures — has been found.

The discovery questions the notion that such ‘eukaryotic' life — which includes all animals and plants — is not suited to the kind of extreme conditions that can be tolerated by bacteria and other organisms lacking a cell nucleus.

“We need to rethink what's possible for a eukaryotic cell in a significant way,” says Angela Oliverio, a microbiologist at Syracuse University in New York. The work, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was described in a preprint1 published on 24 November.

Oliverio and fellow Syracuse microbiologist Beryl Rappaport were part of a team that discovered the organism at Lassen Volcanic National Park in northern California's Cascade mountain range. They named it Incendiamoeba cascadensis, which translates to ‘fire amoeba from the cascades'.

The park is famous for gurgling acid lakes and incandescent geothermal pools, but I. cascadensis comes from a pH-neutral ‘hot stream'. “It's the most uninteresting geothermal feature you'll find in Lassen,” says Rappaport.

Water samples from the stream looked devoid of life under a microscope, but after culturing them with nutrients, the researchers spotted the amoeba growing at 57 °C, within the stream's temperature range. The scientists slowly raised the temperature, sailing past the previous eukaryote record of 60 °C. I. cascadensis was still able to divide at 63 °C and was still moving around at 64 °C. Even at 70 °C, the cells could form dormant ‘cysts' that were capable of reactivating at cooler temperatures.

Poverty Point, a 3,500-year-old earthen mound, is a well-researched UNESCO World Heritage Site, but a pair of studies re-examines its original purpose.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Around 1,500 B.C.E., civilization was really starting to take off. Ancient Egypt was entering a golden age known as the New Kingdom, the Hittites took root in the Middle East, the Shang Dynasty came to power in China, and the Olmecs emerged in the tropical lowlands of what would one day be Mexico. At this same time, in the Lower Mississippi Valley—some 350 miles from the mouth of the North America's largest river—the hunter-gatherers of a burgeoning egalitarian society were constructing one of the oldest and most impressive earthwork monuments in the western hemisphere. 

Known today as Poverty Point—a name derived from a 19th-century plantation that was located near the archaeological site—this approximately 3,500-year-old structure (built sometime between 1700 B.C.E. to 1100 B.C.E.) is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. And while the size of the site is certainly impressive, stretching some 1.5 square miles, these ancient peoples also moved the equivalent of 140,000 dump trucks of dirt without the use of horses or even wheels. 

It's long been known that Poverty Point served as a kind of trading hub for ancient hunter-gatherers spread throughout southeastern and midwestern U.S. But in a new study—published in the journal Southeastern Archaeology—archaeologists from Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) re-examine the origin story of this impressive site, asking why ancient peoples built these mounds in the first place.

Typically, years-long intentional monument building is the work of hierarchies, like those of the pharaohs ruling Egyptians, kings governing Hittites, and Chinese rulers lording over their subjects. But Kidder and his co-author Seth Grooms (a former WashU PhD graduate and a member of the Lumbee tribe of North Carolina) believe that Poverty Point was the work of an egalitarian civilization coming to grips with increased severe weather and massive flooding in the region.

This goes against the previously held belief that this society must have also been hierarchical in nature, similar to the society that constructed Cahokia Mounds a thousand years later near present-day St. Louis, Missouri.

“The Western view is that they wouldn't travel all of that distance and do all of that work unless they were getting something of economic value out of it,” the study's co-author, Tristram Kidder, said in the WashU magazine The Ampersand. “We believe they felt a moral responsibility to repair a torn universe.”

One of the key pieces of evidence that Poverty Point held some spiritual significance is that there's never been archeological evidence of permanent dwellings at the location. “The old paradigm that people lived at Poverty Point continuously for centuries has been crumbling, and we needed a new framework,” Kidder told The Ampersand. 

Instead, what they found were materials such as quartz crystal from Arkansas, soapstone from northern Georgia, and pieces of Great Lakes copper. Kidder and Grooms believe that Poverty Point was a temporary gathering spot for people assembled in the thousands to do what humans do: socialize, trade, worship, and work. That makes Poverty Point a bit of a historical outlier in the ancient world, as Grooms said in another article for The Ampersand in 2023. 

“These people came together to build these incredible monuments, and according to the archaeological evidence, they did it in the absence of any kind of institutional hierarchy, wealth differences, or intensive agricultural systems,” Grooms said at the time. “All of that was once thought to be a prerequisite for social complexity.”

The collection of markings is now thought to have been left by a herd of ancient sea turtles that had been frightened off by a sudden earthquake.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

83 million years ago, the Cònero Riviera on the eastern shore of Italy was a submerged Cretaceous haven for marine reptiles and fish, including the ancestors of modern sea turtles. But one day, ominous rumblings from below sent them scattering en masse, and their frantic flipper marks were frozen in time.

As climbers were scaling the steep limestone slopes of Monte Cònero in the spring of 2019, they found what appeared to be a stampede of footprints embedded in the rock face. The marks appeared similar to ichnofossils—marks left behind by life-forms, but not the remains of the life forms themselves—on a nearby slab of rock discovered by paleontologist Luca Natali months before. Natali would later attribute the traces to extinct marine reptile Coneroichnus marinus, thought to be a type of pliosaur. 

When the climbers brought digital photos of their find to paleontologist Alessandro Montanari at the Geological Observatory of Coldigioco, he knew the prints were worth pursuing. The sheer cliff where the footprints lie over La Vela Beach is over 328 feet (100 meters) above sea level, but that didn't stop Montanari and his research team. They were able to gain access to Cònero Regional Park (closed to the public because of rockfalls) to survey the area on foot, and sent drones to capture more images with a panoramic view from above.

“We hypothesized that the footprints, which were probably made by a group of medium-sized marine vertebrates paddling towards southwest on a soft pelagic seafloor, were preserved on that oozy sediment because they were immediately buried and sealed under a calcilutitic turbidite,” Montanari said in a study recently published in Cretaceous Research.

What creature could have left so many of these traces as it swam away? Well, during the Late Cretaceous, the only vertebrates to live near the bottom of the ocean were fish and reptiles. While the bones of many marine species have been found preserved in limestone that was once underwater, nothing with prints of their feet, fins, or paddles has ever surfaced. Such prints would not have lasted long on a seafloor of oozing sediment—they would have easily been erased by the flow of water or washed away by deep currents.

Because fish do not paddle on the sand with their fins, Montanari and his team needed to consider the types of marine reptiles that were around during that period. They thought it was possible that the tracks came from either mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, or sea turtles from the extinct lineage Protostegidaae, even though no fossilized remains of these sea turtles or plesiosaurs had been found in the region. Despite the lack of fossil evidence, the researchers contiued to investigate every avenue, going off of previous reports of trackways left by a Triassic nothosaur and a sea turtle that lived during the Late Pleistocene.

While ancient sea turtles and plesiosaurs were both mostly solitary creatures, females of most extant sea turtle species will migrate over long distances and in herds to lay their eggs on tropical beaches. In addition, the Hawaiian green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) and Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) are both known to inhabit shallow reefs, and sometimes swim close to the seafloor and brush the sand with their fore-flippers. The environments in which these turtles live are similar to what Monte Cònero and La Vela beach are imagined to have been like tens of millions of years ago.

“The prevalence of sea turtle species in these environments leads us to hypothesize that the myriad trace fossils of the La Vela Slabs represent a mass displacement of a very large number of these animals,” said Montanari, who thinks the ancient critters were probably foraging when they were spooked. “A sudden earthquake provoked a stampede toward the open sea.”

When the already panicked sea turtles tried to escape, some were so close to the seafloor that they left flipper tracks in their wake. The earthquake released calcilutitic fluxoturbidite—coarse deposits mixed with fine-grained sediment that would turn into limestone—which buried and preserved the soft carbonate sediment and its record of a sea turtle mass exodus. Earthquake activity at this time coincides with the period of climate change known as the Early Campanian Event, which was thought to have been triggered by an asteroid impact.

For any rock climbers who might be exploring places known to be fossil beds, it might be worth keeping some form of camera on hand. It could lead to discovering something that has been waiting to be found for tens or even hundreds of millions of years.

Around 12,000 years ago, the last Ice Age drew to a close. Global temperatures rose, the early Holocene began, and human communities gradually shifted toward more permanent settlements. A new study published in Nature Geoscience highlights how the Southern Ocean around Antarctica helped drive this major climate transition.

The research team, led by Dr. Huang Huang of the Laoshan Laboratory in Qingdao and including geochemist Dr. Marcus Gutjahr from GEOMAR, set out to reconstruct how far Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) extended through the Southern Ocean over the past 32,000 years.

"We wanted to understand how the influence of Antarctic Bottom Water, the coldest and densest water mass in the global ocean, changed during the last deglaciation, and what role it played in the global carbon cycle," says Huang, who completed his PhD at GEOMAR in 2019 and now works as a scientist in Qingdao, China.

Sediment cores and chemical fingerprints in the deep sea

To tackle this question, the scientists examined nine sediment cores collected from the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean. The cores came from water depths between about 2,200 and 5,000 meters and from locations spread widely across the region. By analyzing the isotopic composition of the trace metal neodymium preserved in the sediments, which reflects the chemistry of the surrounding seawater, they could reconstruct how Antarctic Bottom Water changed through time on the scale of tens of thousands of years.

"Dissolved neodymium and its isotopic fingerprint in seawater are excellent indicators of the origin of deep-water masses," explains Dr. Marcus Gutjahr. "In earlier studies, we noticed that the neodymium signature in the deep South Atlantic only reached its modern composition around 12,000 years ago. However, sediments from the last Ice Age showed values that are not found anywhere in the Southern Ocean today. Initially, we thought the method was flawed or that there was something wrong with the sediment core. But the real question was: What could generate such a signal? Such an exotic isotopic signature can only develop when deep water remains almost motionless for extended periods. In such circumstances, benthic fluxes -- chemical inputs from the seafloor -- dominate the isotopic imprint in marine sediments."

Stagnant deep waters, carbon storage and the last Ice Age

During the last Ice Age, the cold and very dense deep water that currently forms around Antarctica did not spread as widely as it does today. Instead, much of the deep Southern Ocean was filled with carbon-rich waters that originated in the Pacific, a glacial precursor to today's Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). In the study, CDW is described as carbon-rich because it circulates in the deep ocean for long periods with limited contact with the surface. This isolation allowed large amounts of dissolved carbon to remain locked in the deep ocean, helping to keep atmospheric CO2 levels relatively low.

As Earth warmed and ice sheets retreated between roughly 18,000 and 10,000 years ago, the volume of Antarctic Bottom Water increased in two clear phases. These expansion phases occurred at the same time as known warming events in Antarctica. With more vertical mixing in the Southern Ocean, deep waters that had stored carbon for long periods were brought closer to the surface, allowing that carbon to escape into the atmosphere.

"The expansion of the AABW is linked to several processes," explains Gutjahr. "Warming around Antarctica reduced sea-ice cover, resulting in more meltwater entering the Southern Ocean. The Antarctic Bottom Water formed during this transitional climate period had a lower density due to reduced salinity. This late-glacial AABW was able to spread further through the Southern Ocean, destabilizing the existing water-mass structure and enhancing exchanges between deep and surface waters."

Previously, many scientists assumed that changes in the North Atlantic, particularly the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), were the main drivers of shifts in deep-water circulation in the South Atlantic. The new results suggest that this northern influence was more restricted than earlier thought. Instead, the replacement of a glacial, carbon-rich deep-water mass by newly formed Antarctic Bottom Water appears to have been crucial for the rise in atmospheric CO2 toward the end of the last Ice Age.

Southern Ocean heat, Antarctic ice loss and today's climate

"Comparisons with the past are always imperfect," says Gutjahr, "but ultimately it comes down to how much energy is in the system. If we understand how the ocean responded to warming in the past, we can better grasp what is happening today as Antarctic ice shelves continue to melt."

Because of its vast size and unique circulation, the Southern Ocean plays a major role in controlling the global climate. Over the past 50 years, waters deeper than about 1,000 meters around Antarctica have warmed significantly faster than much of the rest of the world's oceans. To work out how this rapid deep-ocean warming affects the ability of the ocean to absorb and release carbon dioxide, scientists must track physical and biogeochemical changes over long timescales and incorporate them into climate models.

"I want to properly understand the modern ocean in order to interpret signals from the past," Gutjahr says. "If we can trace how Antarctic Bottom Water has changed over the last few thousand years, we can assess more accurately how rapidly the Antarctic Ice Sheet may continue to lose mass in the future."

Paleoclimate data obtained from sediment cores are indispensable for this, offering insights into past climates that were warmer than today and helping to improve projections of future climate change.

Retrons are prokaryotic genetic elements involved in anti-phage defense and consist of a non-coding RNA, a reverse transcriptase (RT), and various effector proteins. Retron-Eco7 (previously known as Retron-Ec78) from Escherichia coli encodes two effector proteins (the PtuA ATPase and the PtuB nuclease) and degrades the host tRNATyr upon phage infection, thereby protecting host cells against invading phages. However, its defense mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the Retron-Eco7 complex, comprising the RT, multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA), PtuA, and PtuB. The Retron-Eco7 structures reveal that the RT–msDNA complex associates with two PtuA–PtuB complexes, potentially inhibiting their nuclease activity and suppressing bacterial growth arrest prior to phage infection. Furthermore, the phage-encoded D15 nuclease acts as a trigger for the Retron-Eco7 system and cleaves the msDNA bound to the complex, facilitating the dissociation of PtuA–PtuB from RT–msDNA. Our data indicate that msDNA cleavage by D15 is the initial step required for the specific cleavage of the host tRNATyr by the PtuA–PtuB nuclease, which leads to abortive infection. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insights into the Retron-Eco7 system and highlights the diversity of prokaryotic anti-phage defense mechanisms.

Prokaryotes have evolved a variety of defense mechanisms to combat foreign nucleic acids, such as phages and plasmids1,2,3,4. Some of these systems, including restriction-modification systems and CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems, directly target and eliminate invading nucleic acids5,6. In contrast, abortive infection systems induce cell dormancy or death upon infection, thereby preventing phage propagation and protecting the cell population7.

Retrons are prokaryotic genetic elements consisting of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA), a reverse transcriptase (RT), and diverse effector proteins, and are classified into 13 types based on the type of effector proteins8,9. The ncRNA contains msr and msd regions (hereafter referred to as msrRNA and msdRNA, respectively), with two inverted repeat regions (a1 in the msrRNA and a2 in the msdRNA)10 (Fig. 1a). The RT enzyme recognizes the a1 and a2 regions and reverse-transcribes complementary DNA from the 2′-OH group of the conserved guanosine residue (branching G) in the msrRNA, using the msdRNA as the template8,11 (Fig. 1a, b). Subsequently, the msdRNA is degraded by RNase H1, producing a unique RNA–DNA hybrid with a 2′-5′ covalent linkage (known as multi-copy single-stranded DNA (msDNA))11,12,13. Retron systems have been harnessed for genome engineering technologies, due to their ability to produce high copy numbers of DNA with customizable sequences8,14,15,16,17.

The first retron was discovered in 198410, but its biological functions have remained elusive for decades. However, recent studies revealed that retron elements function as toxin-antitoxin systems, with the RT–msDNA complex acting as the antitoxin and its cognate effector protein as the toxin, thus protecting bacterial cells against phage infections through diverse mechanisms18,19,20. In addition, recent studies of Retron-Eco1 (also known as Retron-Ec86) revealed that the RT–msDNA complex associates with its N-glycosidase effector to form a filament capable of hydrolyzing NAD(P)+, thereby providing mechanistic insights into Retron-Eco1-mediated anti-phage defense21,22,23. Retron-Eco7 (also known as Retron-Ec78) comprises an RT, a 144-nucleotide (nt) ncRNA, and two effector proteins, PtuA (the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family ATPase) and PtuB (the HNH nuclease)18,19,24 (Fig. 1c). Recently, we reported that the Retron-Eco7 system cleaves the host tRNATyr and participates in anti-phage defense, which is inhibited by a phage-encoded tRNA25. However, the action mechanism of Retron-Eco7 remains unknown.

In this study, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the Retron-Eco7 complex, consisting of one RT–msDNA complex and two PtuA–PtuB complexes. Our structural and functional data indicate that RT–msDNA associates with PtuA–PtuB, thereby suppressing bacterial growth arrest prior to phage infection. We further found that the phage-encoded D15 nuclease cleaves the msDNA within the Retron-Eco7 complex, facilitating the dissociation of PtuA–PtuB, which leads to host tRNATyr cleavage and ultimately abortive infection. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into anti-phage defense by Retron-Eco7 and highlight the mechanistic diversity of prokaryotic defense systems.

To investigate the defense activity of Retron-Eco7, we expressed the Retron-Eco7 system, comprising the RT, the ncRNA, PtuA, and PtuB, in Escherichia coli (Fig. 1c). We then infected the bacterial cells with either T-series phages (T1–T7), the SP15 phage, which is highly similar to the wild-type (WT) T5 phage, or the mutant SP15 phage (SP15m), which lacks the anti-defense protein Rad and tRNATyr (SP-tRNATyr)25 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Using spot assays, we subsequently examined the defense activity of Retron-Eco7 against these phages. Consistent with our recent study25, Retron-Eco7 protected E. coli against T5 and SP15m, but not SP15 (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1b). Mutations of the putative catalytic residues in the PtuA ATPase (D395A) and the PtuB HNH nuclease (H57A) abolished the defense activity (Fig. 1d), suggesting that the enzymatic activities of both PtuA (ATPase) and PtuB (nuclease) are essential for Retron-Eco7-mediated anti-phage defense. Next, we monitored the growth of E. coli cells containing Retron-Eco7 after infection with SP15m. The expression of PtuA and PtuB, but not Retron-Eco7 (RT–ncRNA–PtuA–PtuB), inhibited bacterial growth without phage infection (Fig. 1e), suggesting that PtuA–PtuB and RT–msDNA function as a toxin and an antitoxin, respectively. A mutation in either PtuA (D395A) or PtuB (H57A) abolished the toxicity of PtuA–PtuB (Fig. 1e), indicating that the enzymatic activities of both PtuA and PtuB are crucial for growth inhibition. E. coli cells containing Retron-Eco7 exhibited normal growth under low multiplicity of infection (MOI) conditions, whereas their growth was inhibited under high MOI conditions (Fig. 1f). Collectively, these results indicate that Retron-Eco7 protects E. coli against phage infection through an abortive infection mechanism.

To explore the defense mechanism of Retron-Eco7, we initially examined whether its defense activity is affected by the addition of affinity tags to the Retron-Eco7 components. We confirmed that the Retron-Eco7 system, comprising the ncRNA, His6-tagged RT, PtuA, and Twin-Strep-tagged PtuB, exhibits comparable activity to that of the untagged system (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). Thus, we co-expressed the tagged Retron-Eco7 system in E. coli, isolated the complex using Strep-Tactin resin, and further purified it by size-exclusion chromatography (Supplementary Fig. 2a). SDS-PAGE and urea-PAGE analyses of the peak fraction eluted from the size-exclusion column revealed that the complex comprises the RT, PtuA, PtuB, and the msDNA (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Our analysis confirmed that the msDNA is an RNA–DNA hybrid consisting of a ~ 40-nt msrRNA and an ~80-nt msdDNA (Supplementary Fig. 2a), indicating that the msdRNA region in the ncRNA was reverse-transcribed by the RT to produce the msdDNA, which was then processed in E. coli, as previously described24,26.

We determined the cryo-EM structures of the RT–msDNA–PtuA–PtuB complex (referred to as the Retron-Eco7 complex) in five distinct states (states 1–5) at 2.6–2.8-Å resolutions (Fig. 1g, h, Supplementary Figs. 2b–g and 3a, b, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Movie 1). The cryo-EM structure revealed that the Retron-Eco7 complex consists of an RT molecule, an msDNA molecule, four PtuA molecules (PtuA.1–PtuA.4), and two PtuB molecules (PtuB.1 and PtuB.2), except for state 5, which contains an additional RT–msDNA complex (RT.2 and msDNA.2) (Fig. 1g, h and Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). PtuA.1 and PtuA.3 interact with PtuA.2 and PtuA.4, respectively, to form dimers, which in turn interact with PtuB.1 and PtuB.2, respectively. Both the msrRNA and msdDNA regions of the msDNA are recognized by the RT, while the msdDNA region is sandwiched by the two PtuA dimers. PtuA.1 and PtuA.2 interact with PtuA.4 and PtuA.3 via their coiled-coil domains, respectively, forming a tetrameric assembly surrounding the msdDNA. PtuA.1 also interacts with the RT and the msrRNA.

Since the C-terminal domain of a PtuB molecule is sandwiched between the C-terminal domains of two PtuA molecules, the PtuB molecules (PtuB.1 and PtuB.2) can bind to the PtuA dimers (PtuA.1–PtuA.2 and PtuA.3–PtuA.4) in two distinct orientations (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Consequently, states 1–4 are structurally similar, except for the orientations of PtuB relative to the PtuA dimers. In state 5, RT.2 interacts with PtuA.4, msDNA.1, and msDNA.2 (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e). Similar to states 1–4, the DNA region of msDNA.1 is recognized by the two PtuA dimers, while the corresponding region of msDNA.2 is largely disordered and forms only a few contacts with the proteins, suggesting that a single RT–msDNA module is sufficient for the assembly of the Retron-Eco7 complex. Since the structures in states 1–5 are essentially similar and likely functionally relevant, we focus on the structure of state 1 unless otherwise stated. Overall, our cryo-EM analysis shows that the RT–msDNA complex binds to the two PtuA–PtuB complexes primarily through interactions between the msDNA and the PtuA dimers.

The Retron-Eco7 ncRNA comprises the msrRNA and the msdRNA, with the 5′ region of the msrRNA (a1 inverted repeat) and the 3′ region of the msdRNA (a2 inverted repeat) forming a stem that ends with the branching guanosine (G0) and its opposing guanosine (G127) (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In the Retron-Eco7 structure, the msDNA consists of a 41-nt msrRNA (nucleotides (−58)–(−18)) and a 73-nt msdDNA (nucleotides 5–77), with nucleotides (−55)–(−50) in the msrRNA and nucleotides 72–77 in the msdDNA forming an RNA–DNA heteroduplex (Fig. 2a–c and Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). The present structure reveals that nucleotides 1–77 in the msdDNA are reverse-transcribed, whereas a previous study reported that the Retron-Eco7 msDNA contains a 78-nucleotide msdDNA (thus, Retron-Eco7 was formerly called Retron-Ec78)24. Similarly, the recently reported Retron-Eco1 structure showed that its msDNA contains an 85-nucleotide msdDNA21,22,23, which is one nucleotide shorter than previously reported27. These discrepancies might arise from incorrect estimations of msdDNA lengths in earlier biochemical studies24,27. In the present structure, the msrRNA contains a linker region (referred to as L1, nucleotides (−49)–(−40)) and stem loop 2 (SL2, nucleotides (−39)–(−18)), while the msdDNA contains stem loop 3 (SL3, nucleotides 5–64) and a linker region (referred to as L2, nucleotides 65–71) (Fig. 2a–c and Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). No densities were observed for nucleotides 0–(−17) in the msrRNA and nucleotides 1–4 in the msdDNA (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4c), consistent with our data indicating that these regions were processed by endogenous nucleases in E. coli (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Overall, these observations confirmed that the msDNA in the Retron-Eco7 complex exists as a non-branched RNA–DNA hybrid, as previously reported24,26.

The RT in Retron-Eco7 (RT-Eco7) is structurally similar to other known RTs, such as the RT in Retron-Eco1 (RT-Eco1)21,22,23 and the RT domain of the Bombyx mori R2 retrotransposon (RT-R2Bm)28,29, and adopts a right-hand-shaped fold consisting of palm, finger, and thumb domains (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). SL2 and L1/L2 of the msDNA are extensively recognized by the thumb and palm/finger domains, respectively, while stem loop 3 forms only a few contacts with the palm domain at its 5′ end (Figs. 2d, e and 3). The RNA–DNA heteroduplex is bound to the active site formed by the palm, finger, and thumb domains, with the conserved YADD motif (residues 185–188) in the palm domain located near the 3′ end of the msdDNA (Figs. 2d, f and 3). A structural comparison of RT-Eco7 with RT-R2Bm revealed that, in the Retron-Eco7 structure, the binding site of an incoming nucleotide is occupied by A(–47) in the msrRNA L1 linker (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 5a), while the template nucleotide U(–49) is flipped out from the heteroduplex and forms hydrogen bonds with Q46 (finger) and A69 (L2), with its nucleobase stacked between Y32 (finger) and A70 (L2) (Figs. 2g and 3). Thus, the present structure represents a termination state in the reverse-transcription reaction. To assess the functional relevance of the RT–msDNA interactions, we examined the effects of alanine mutations in the RT enzyme on the Retron-Eco7 activity using spot assays in E. coli. The D187A/D188A mutations in the RT active site abolished the defense activity (Fig. 2h), confirming the critical role of the reverse transcription activity in the Retron-Eco7 function. The thumb domain deletion (Δ235–313) also abolished the activity (Fig. 2h), indicating the functional importance of the interaction between the thumb domain and the msrRNA stem loop 2. In addition, the Y32A, R42A, and Q46A mutations moderately or substantially reduced the activity (Fig. 2h), highlighting the importance of the interactions stabilizing the reverse-transcription termination state.

The residues that interact with nucleic acids through their main chains are shown in parentheses.

While the msrRNA and msdDNA regions of Retron-Eco7 share sequence similarity with those of Retron-Eco1, the structures of their msdDNA regions differ substantially (Supplementary Fig. 5a, c). In the Retron-Eco1 structure, SL2 and L1/L2 of the msDNA are recognized by the RT in a manner similar to that observed in the Retron-Eco7 structure, with the RT active site occluded by an adenosine corresponding to A(–47) of the Retron-Eco7 msrRNA21,22,23 (Supplementary Fig. 5a). These structural findings suggest that Retron-RT-mediated reverse transcription terminates at a specific position in the msdRNA, with the termination site defined by interactions between the RT and SL2–L2 in the msrRNA, consistent with previous biochemical data22. However, there are notable structural differences between the Retron-Eco7 and Retron-Eco1 complexes. SL1 and the a1:a2 stem are flexible and disordered in the Retron-Eco7 structure, whereas the corresponding regions are ordered and interact with the RT in the Retron-Eco1 structure (Supplementary Fig. 5a). In addition, the orientation of msdDNA SL3 in the Retron-Eco1 complex differs from that in the Retron-Eco7 complex (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Together, these observations highlight both the conserved and divergent structural features among the RT–msDNA complexes in different retron systems.

PtuA consists of an N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1–63), an ATPase domain (residues 64–254 and 311–442), a coiled-coil (CC) domain (residues 255–310), a linker domain (residues 443–483), and a C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 484–550) (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Figs. 6a and 7a, b). The NTD comprises three α-helices and two β-strands. Two N-terminal α-helices in the PtuA.1 NTD interact with RT–msDNA, while those of PtuA.2, PtuA.3, and PtuA.4 are less resolved in the density map, due to the lack of interactions (Fig. 4b). The CC domain comprises two α-helices and mediates PtuA–PtuA interactions, while the CTD contains three α-helices and participates in PtuA–PtuB interactions (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 7a, b).

The ATPase domain adopts an ABC ATPase fold with the Walker A (93-GNNGKGKT-100) and Walker B (391-IVLIDE-396) motifs (Fig. 4a, c and Supplementary Fig. 7b, c). Similar to other known ATPases30, the ATPase domains of PtuA.1 and PtuA.3 interact with those of PtuA.2 and PtuA.4, respectively, to form head-to-head dimers, which are further stabilized by their linker domains (Supplementary Fig. 7a, c). Interestingly, two ADP molecules are bound to the active sites at the PtuA.1–PtuA.2 interface, with the Walker A motifs engaging the ADP phosphate groups (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 7c). In contrast, one ADP molecule is bound at the PtuA.3–PtuA.4 interface, as the Walker A motif in PtuA.3 adopts an α-helical conformation rather than a loop conformation, for unknown reasons (Supplementary Fig. 7c). In the ADP-bound PtuA ATPase domains (PtuA.1, PtuA.2, and PtuA.4), N95 (Walker A) and E396 (Walker B) in one protomer form hydrogen bonds with H400/H402 and H400 in the neighboring protomer, respectively, stabilizing the dimer interface (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 7c). Notably, the N95A, E396A, and H400A mutations abolished the anti-phage defense activity in E. coli (Fig. 4d), indicating that the ADP-mediated dimerization of PtuA is essential for the Retron-Eco7 function.

To further investigate the functional role of the bound ADP molecules, we measured the in vitro ATPase activities of the purified PtuA alone, the WT Retron-Eco7 complex, and those containing either the PtuA D395A mutation or the PtuB H57A mutation. The Retron-Eco7 complex, but not PtuA alone, hydrolyzed ATP to produce ADP, while the PtuA D395A mutation, but not the PtuB H57A mutation, abolished the ATPase activity (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). These results indicate that PtuA functions as an active ATPase within the Retron-Eco7 complex. Thus, the bound ADP molecules are likely produced from ATP in E. coli cells via the PtuA ATPase activity within the Retron-Eco7 complex. Given that an E-to-Q mutation in the Walker B motif of the Rad50 ATPase abolished ATP hydrolysis while retaining ATP binding31, we examined the anti-phage defense activity of the Retron-Eco7 complex containing the equivalent PtuA E396Q mutation in the Walker B motif. The E396Q mutation abolished the defense activity in E. coli (Fig. 4d), indicating that PtuA-mediated ATP hydrolysis, rather than ATP binding alone, is necessary for the Retron-Eco7 function. These findings suggest that, within the Retron-Eco7 complex, PtuA continuously hydrolyzes ATP to produce ADP, which stabilizes the PtuA dimer and facilitates the interaction between RT–msDNA and PtuA–PtuB.

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the stability of the WT and mutant Retron-Eco7 complexes using size-exclusion chromatography. The WT and PtuB H57A mutant complexes eluted as single peaks (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b), confirming their stability. In contrast, the PtuA D395A mutation resulted in the dissociation of the PtuA–PtuB complex from the RT–msDNA complex (Supplementary Fig. 8c), indicating that the PtuA-mediated ADP production is essential for the interaction between RT–msDNA and PtuA–PtuB. This mechanism is reminiscent of that for the Rad50 ATPase, where ATP binding promotes Rad50 dimerization and enhances DNA interactions31,32,33. Unlike the PtuA D395A mutation, the PtuB H57A mutation did not cause dissociation of the complex but instead increased its aggregation (Supplementary Fig. 8b). These results suggest that the integrity of the PtuB active site is important for the stability of the Retron-Eco7 complex, thereby affecting PtuA-mediated ATP hydrolysis, consistent with our findings that the PtuB H57A mutation reduces the ATPase activity (Fig. 4e). Taken together, these data indicate that PtuA hydrolyzes ATP to generate ADP, thus helping to maintain the structural integrity of the Retron-Eco7 complex.

PtuB consists of an HNH nuclease domain (residues 1–152) and a C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 153–216) (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 6b). The HNH domain of PtuB is similar to other HNH domains34, such as those of PtuB from the Septu defense system35 and Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9)36,37 (Supplementary Fig. 9a). The HNH domain of PtuB contains a conserved histidine residue (H57) and resembles that of SpCas9 in its active, rather than inactive, conformation (Supplementary Fig. 9b–d), suggesting that PtuB in the Retron-Eco7 complex adopts a nearly active conformation. Unlike the other HNH domains, the PtuB HNH domain contains a zinc finger, in which a zinc ion is coordinated by C43, C46, C78, and C90 (Supplementary Fig. 9e). Alanine substitutions of these cysteine residues (C43A/C46A/C78A/C90A) abolished the defense activity (Fig. 4d), highlighting the functional importance of the zinc finger in PtuB. The CTD of PtuB contains three α-helices and interacts with the CTDs of PtuA (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 9a).

The two PtuA–PtuB complexes associate with the RT–msDNA scaffold primarily through interactions between the msdDNA and the PtuA dimers, while PtuB.1 and PtuB.2 interact with PtuA.1–PtuA.2 and PtuA.3–PtuA.4 through their CTDs, respectively (Figs. 3 and 4b, f, g). Specifically, residues R126, R163, R171, and K180 of PtuA.1, PtuA.3, and PtuA.4 interact with the nucleobases or backbone phosphate groups of the msdDNA (Figs. 3 and 4f). Mutations of these residues resulted in mild (R171A and K180A) or substantial (R126A and R163A) reductions in Retron-Eco7-mediated anti-phage defense (Fig. 4i), confirming the functional importance of the PtuA–msdDNA interactions. Consistently, E. coli cells expressing Retron-Eco7 with either the R126A or R163A mutation in PtuA exhibited growth defects, as observed in E. coli cells expressing only PtuA–PtuB (Fig. 4j), highlighting the significance of the PtuA–msdDNA interaction in suppressing the toxicity of PtuA–PtuB. Among the four PtuA molecules, PtuA.1 interacts with the msrRNA sugar-phosphate backbone, with its NTD contacting both stem loop 2 and the linker region in the msrRNA (Figs. 3 and 4h). Deletion of the two N-terminal α-helices (residues 3–36) of PtuA abolished the anti-phage defense activity (Fig. 4i), underscoring the functional importance of the PtuA–msrRNA interaction. E471 of PtuA.1 and D521, K526, and R533 of PtuA.2 form salt bridges with R160, R49, E200, and E192 of PtuB.2, respectively (Fig. 4g). The D521R mutation, but not E471R, K526E, and R533E, in PtuA reduced the anti-phage defense activity (Fig. 4i), confirming the functional importance of the PtuA–PtuB interaction. Deletions of the PtuA CC domain (residues 260–305), PtuA CTD (residues 484–550), and PtuB CTD (residues 135–216) also reduced the defense activity (Fig. 4i), suggesting that these domains are essential for the complex formation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the formation of the RT–msDNA–PtuA–PtuB complex is essential for Retron-Eco7-mediated anti-phage defense.

Our recent study indicated that E. coli tRNATyr (Ec-tRNATyr) is degraded by the Retron-Eco7 system upon phage infection, leading to abortive infection25. To investigate whether Ec-tRNATyr is cleaved by the Retron-Eco7 system, we infected E. coli cells (with or without Retron-Eco7) with the SP15m phage, extracted total RNA from the cells at 20 min post infection, and detected Ec-tRNATyr using northern blotting. We observed cleavage fragments of Ec-tRNATyr in the lysates from SP15m-infected E. coli cells containing Retron-Eco7, but not in those lacking Retron-Eco7 (Supplementary Fig. 10a). In contrast, cleavage products were not detected in the lysates from SP15m-uninfected cells, regardless of the presence of Retron-Eco7 (Supplementary Fig. 10a). These results indicated that Ec-tRNATyr is cleaved by the Retron-Eco7 system upon phage infection. Mutations in either PtuA (D395A) or PtuB (H57A) resulted in the loss of Ec-tRNATyr cleavage fragments (Supplementary Fig. 10a), confirming that both PtuA and PtuB are necessary for tRNATyr cleavage. To determine the cleavage site of Ec-tRNATyr, we performed tRNA fragment sequencing on total RNA extracted from SP15-infected E. coli cells with Retron-Eco7, as well as from SP15-uninfected cells with only PtuA–PtuB. We detected an Ec-tRNATyr fragment downstream of U47 in the total tRNA from both cell types (Supplementary Fig. 10b), indicating that the Retron-Eco7 system is activated upon phage infection, with PtuA–PtuB cleaving Ec-tRNATyr between U47 and C48 in the variable loop region.

Our recent study showed that SP15 phage-encoded tRNATyr (SP-tRNATyr) suppresses the Retron-Eco7-mediated anti-phage defense25. To explore its mechanism, we infected E. coli cells (with or without Retron-Eco7) with either SP15 or the tRNATyr-lacking SP15 mutant (SP15m), and then visualized Ec-tRNATyr, SP-tRNATyr, and E. coli tRNAGly (Ec-tRNAGly) using northern blotting. In E. coli cells with Retron-Eco7, Ec-tRNATyr, but neither SP-tRNATyr nor Ec-tRNAGly, was cleaved after phage infection (Fig. 5a). Both Ec-tRNATyr and SP-tRNATyr possess longer variable loops as compared to other tRNAs, such as Ec-tRNAGly (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 10c, d), consistent with the observation that Ec-tRNAGly was not cleaved by Retron-Eco7. Co-expression of Retron-Eco7 with SP-tRNATyr, but not with Ec-tRNATyr, in E. coli led to the loss of defense against SP15m (Fig. 5c). In contrast, co-expression of Retron-Eco7 with SP-tRNATyr mutants, in which the variable loop (A47–U59) was deleted or replaced with the 5-nt shorter loop of Ec-tRNATyr, provided defense against SP15m (Fig. 5c), highlighting the importance of the variable loop of SP-tRNATyr for Retron-Eco7 inhibition. Furthermore, E. coli cells expressing PtuA–PtuB with either Ec-tRNATyr or SP-tRNATyr exhibited normal growth (Fig. 5d), indicating that the overexpression of these tRNAs neutralizes the PtuA–PtuB toxicity. Collectively, these results suggest that SP-tRNATyr compensates for the decreased levels of Ec-tRNATyr, thereby leading to the suppression of the Retron-Eco7 anti-phage defense.

a Northern blot analysis of Ec-tRNATyr, SP-tRNATyr, and Ec-tRNAGly. Total RNA was extracted from E. coli cells (with or without Retron-Eco7) with or without phage infection (SP15 or SP15m), and resolved by 10% denaturing urea-PAGE. Total RNA was visualized using ethidium bromide, while Ec-tRNATyr, SP-tRNATyr, and Ec-tRNAGly were individually detected using northern blotting. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. b Schematics of Ec-tRNATyr and SP-tRNATyr. The Ec-tRNATyr site cleaved by Retron-Eco7 is indicated by a yellow triangle. tRNA modifications are omitted for clarity. c Suppression of Retron-Eco7 by the phage-encoded SP-tRNATyr. E. coli cells were transformed with WT Retron-Eco7 together with either Ec-tRNATyr, SP-tRNATyr, or SP-tRNATyr mutants (V-loop deletion or chimera), and their defense activities against SP15m were evaluated using spot assays. The variable loop (G47–C60) of SP-tRNAᵀʸʳ was deleted and replaced with that of Ec-tRNAᵀʸʳ (G46–C54) in the V-loop deletion and chimera mutants, respectively. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. d Growth curves of E. coli cells expressing only PtuA–PtuB or co-expressing PtuA–PtuB along with either Ec-tRNATyr, SP-tRNATyr, or Ec-tRNAGly. Data represent the mean ± SD of three biological replicates (n = 3).

To clarify how Retron-Eco7 detects phage infection, we infected E. coli cells containing Retron-Eco7 with SP15m and then isolated four escaper phages that evaded the Retron-Eco7 defense (Supplementary Fig. 11a). Whole-genome sequencing revealed that all four escaper phages contain point mutations in the gene encoding the D15 nuclease, which is essential for the expression of late genes in T5 phage genomes38 (Fig. 6a). Given that D15 exhibits endonuclease activity and that the escaper mutation (R86Q and R86L) is located near the active site in the D15–DNA complex structure39,40 (Supplementary Fig. 11b, c), we hypothesized that D15 cleaves the msdDNA within the Retron-Eco7 complex, allowing PtuA–PtuB to dissociate from the complex. First, we confirmed that the purified D15 protein cleaves both single- and double-stranded DNAs, but not single-stranded RNA, in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 11d, e). Next, we incubated the purified WT D15 or its mutants (R86L or R86Q) with the Retron-Eco7 complex and examined the cleavage of msDNA by urea-PAGE. The WT D15 cleaved the msdDNA, but not the msrRNA, within the Retron-Eco7 complex (Fig. 6b). In contrast, both mutants failed to efficiently cleave the msdDNA (Fig. 6b). Furthermore, the Retron-Eco7 complex treated with D15 yielded two distinct peaks corresponding to PtuA–PtuB and RT–msDNA on size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 6c), indicating that D15-mediated msdDNA cleavage facilitates the dissociation of PtuA–PtuB from the Retron-Eco7 complex. To further explore D15's role in Retron-Eco7 activation, we measured the in vitro tRNA cleavage activities of the Retron-Eco7 complex with and without D15 treatment. Unexpectedly, the Retron-Eco7 complex did not efficiently cleave either Ec-tRNATyr or SP-tRNATyr, regardless of the D15 treatment, at least under our conditions (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 11f). Consistently, in contrast to the expression of PtuA–PtuB, the co-expression of Retron-Eco7 and D15 did not induce cell dormancy in E. coli (Fig. 6e). Whereas the PtuA–PtuB nucleases from the Septu system35 and the Retron-Eco4 system (also known as Retron-Ec83 or Retron-Septu)41 degrade dsDNA and ssDNA, respectively, the Retron-Eco7 complex exhibited almost no DNA cleavage activity (Supplementary Fig. 11g). Collectively, our data indicate that D15 is necessary but not sufficient for Retron-Eco7 activation, suggesting that additional unknown factors are required for the activation.

a Spot assays of the isolated escaper SP15m phages. E. coli cells harboring the Retron-Eco7 plasmid or an empty vector were infected with the SP15m phage or the four escaper phages. Mutations in the D15 nuclease gene in the escaper phages are indicated on the right. b In vitro msDNA cleavage by the D15 nuclease. The purified Retron-Eco7 complex was incubated with purified WT D15 or its mutants (R86L or R86Q) at 37 °C for 1, 5, and 30 min, and then analyzed by denaturing urea-PAGE. The nucleic acids were visualized with SYBR Gold. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. c Dissociation of PtuA–PtuB from the Retron-Eco7 complex by D15 treatment. The purified Retron-Eco7 complex was incubated with the purified D15 nuclease at 37 °C for 10 min, and then separated by size-exclusion chromatography. The peak fractions (indicated by a red line) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and denaturing urea-PAGE. The proteins and nucleic acids were visualized with CBB and SYBR Gold, respectively. Experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. d In vitro tRNA cleavage by the Retron-Eco7 complex. The 5′-Cy5-labeled Ec-tRNATyr (200 nM) was incubated with the purified Retron-Eco7 complex (500 nM) with or without the purified D15 (500 nM) at 37 °C for 60 min, and then analyzed by denaturing urea-PAGE. The nucleic acids (msrRNA and msdDNA) were visualized with SYBR Gold, while Ec-tRNATyr was detected using Cy5 fluorescence. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. e Spot assays of E. coli cells expressing Retron-Eco7 (with or without D15), D15, or PtuA–PtuB. Assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. f Proposed model of the Retron-Eco7 anti-phage defense.

Our functional and structural data suggest that, in the Retron-Eco7 system, RT–msDNA binds to the PtuA–PtuB effector nuclease and inhibits the cleavage of the host tRNATyr by PtuA–PtuB, while PtuA–PtuB dissociates from RT–msDNA upon phage infection, leading to the host tRNATyr cleavage and thereby conferring anti-phage defense through abortive infection (Fig. 6f). Our findings reinforce the concept that, in retron systems, the RT–msDNA and effector proteins function as an anti-toxin and a toxin, respectively, thus protecting host bacterial cells.

The Retron-Eco7 complex structure represents the second example of a structurally characterized retron complex, enabling structural comparisons between different retron complexes. Notable similarities and differences exist between the Retron-Eco7 complex and the recently reported Retron-Eco1 complex21,22,23 (Fig. 7a). The ncRNAs of Eco1 and Eco7 contain similar msrRNA sequences but differ in their msdRNA sequences (which serve as templates for reverse transcription). In the structures of Eco1 and Eco7, the msdRNA regions are reverse-transcribed by the RT into msdDNA, forming an msrRNA–msdDNA hybrid. In particular, the RT–msDNA complexes in the Eco1 and Eco7 systems adopt similar reverse-transcription termination states. In both structures, the msrRNA–msdDNA heteroduplex is accommodated within the RT active site, with the terminal nucleotide in the msdDNA defined by RT–msrRNA interactions in comparable manners. In contrast, the msdDNA nucleotides outside the heteroduplex adopt distinct structures and serve as scaffolds to recruit their cognate effector proteins, highlighting the common principle that the RT–msDNA binds its cognate effector to suppress the toxicity of the effector prior to phage infection. However, the binding modes of RT–msDNA to effectors differ substantially between the Eco1 and Eco7 structures (Fig. 7a). In the Eco7 structure, one RT–msDNA complex interacts with two effectors (PtuA–PtuB), primarily through msDNA–PtuA interactions. In contrast, in the Eco1 structure, one RT–msDNA complex associates with a single effector (N-glycosidase), forming a dimer primarily through effector–effector interactions. Furthermore, the Eco1 dimer interacts with another Eco1 dimer through RT–RT interactions, thereby forming a filament structure. Consistent with these structural differences, RT-Eco7 lacks the α helix corresponding to the N-terminal α helix in RT-Eco1, which is essential for Eco1 dimerization.

We identified the phage-encoded D15 nuclease as a trigger for the type I-A Retron-Eco7. Our biochemical data demonstrated that D15 cleaves the msDNA in the Retron-Eco7 complex, facilitating the release of PtuA–PtuB from RT–msDNA. Recently, George et al. reported that, in the type I-A retron system from E. coli FORC 82 (Retron-FORC), one RT–msDNA complex associates with two PtuA–PtuB effector nucleases to form a large complex similar to the Retron-Eco7 complex42. In addition, George et al. showed that the co-expression of the Retron-FORC system and D15 leads to msDNA degradation in E. coli, thereby inducing cell death42. These findings highlight the conserved role of D15 as a trigger protein among type I-A retrons. In contrast, in the type II-A3 Retron-Eco1 system, the phage-encoded Dcm methylase serves as the trigger and methylates the msdDNA in the Retron-Eco1 complex, likely leading to a conformational change in the N-glycosidase effector23. Subsequently, the effector enzyme hydrolyzes NAD(P)+ to produce a 5′-diphosphate ribose, potentially resulting in NAD(P)+ depletion and DNA ADP ribosylation, although the detailed mechanism remains unclear22,23. These observations reinforce the notion that msDNAs function as sensors of phage infection through diverse mechanisms. Recent studies showed that other retrons, such as Retron-Sen220 and Retron-Eco618, possess ncRNAs with distinct msdRNA sequences, utilize specific effectors with diverse activities, and detect different phage components, highlighting the structural and mechanistic variations among retron systems.

Like the Retron-Eco7 system, the Septu defense system employs the PtuA–PtuB nuclease for anti-phage defense35. However, there are notable differences in their action mechanisms. First, PtuA–PtuB degrades the phage DNA in the Septu system, but cleaves the host tRNATyr in the Retron-Eco7 system. Second, Retron-Eco7 PtuA exhibits ATPase activity, whereas Septu PtuA lacks ATPase activity and functions as an ATP-binding protein, with the DNase activity of PtuA–PtuB inhibited by ATP binding. Third, the RNase activity of Retron-Eco7 PtuA–PtuB is triggered by D15-mediated msDNA cleavage, while the DNase activity of Septu PtuA–PtuB is enhanced by the reduced cellular ATP levels upon phage infection. A structural comparison of the PtuA–PtuB complexes from the Septu and Retron-Eco7 systems provides insights into their mechanistic differences (Fig. 7b). In both structures, the PtuA dimer binds to PtuB in a similar manner, but the PtuA–PtuB complexes adopt distinct oligomeric states. In the Retron-Eco7 structure, two PtuA dimers extensively interact with the msDNA, with their CC domains stabilizing the complex. In contrast, in the Septu structure, two PtuA dimers are bridged by a third PtuA dimer (lacking PtuB), without direct contacts between the first and second dimers. Consistent with these structural differences, Septu PtuA lacks a CC domain. These structural variations likely reflect the functional differences between the PtuA–PtuB nucleases in the two systems. However, it remains unclear why Retron-Eco7 PtuA–PtuB cleaves the host tRNA, while Septu PtuA–PtuB degrades the phage DNA, given that both PtuB nucleases adopt similar HNH folds.

Unexpectedly, our data indicated that Retron-Eco7 cleaved tRNATyr in phage-infected E. coli cells, but not in vitro even after treatment with the D15 nuclease. Consistent with our findings, Wang et al. recently reported that Retron-Eco7 does not cleave tRNATyr in vitro, even after msDNA degradation by DNase I43. Wang et al. and Li et al. determined the cryo-EM structures of the Retron-Eco7 complex, comprising RT–msDNA, PtuA, and PtuB, which are essentially identical to our complex structure43,44. Furthermore, Wang et al. and Li et al. reported the cryo-EM structures of the RT–msDNA-unbound PtuA–PtuB complex in distinct stoichiometries (PtuA4–PtuB243 and PtuA2–PtuB144), demonstrating that PtuA and PtuB can form a complex after dissociation from RT–msDNA, although the stoichiometry of the functional complex remains unclear. To gain mechanistic insights into tRNATyr recognition by PtuA–PtuB, we used AlphaFold 345 to predict a structural model of the PtuA–PtuB complex bound to tRNATyr, based on the RT–msDNA-unbound PtuA4–PtuB2 structure. We obtained structural models of the tRNATyr-bound PtuA–PtuB complex, in which the active site of the PtuB nuclease is located near either the anticodon loop or the CCA end of tRNATyr (Supplementary Fig. 12). A structural comparison of the Retron-Eco7 complex with the tRNA-bound PtuA–PtuB complex suggests that RT–msDNA prevents the tRNA substrate from accessing the PtuB active site, and that the dissociation of PtuA–PtuB from RT–msDNA allows for tRNA recognition. However, we did not obtain a model where the PtuB active site is located near the tRNATyr variable loop containing the cleavage site identified in our RNA-seq analysis. Thus, how tRNATyr is recognized and cleaved by the PtuA–PtuB complex remains unresolved. Notably, the co-expression of Retron-Eco7 and D15 did not induce bacterial growth arrest, suggesting that additional factors are necessary for the full activation of Retron-Eco7. It is possible that unknown factors further facilitate the dissociation of PtuB from the PtuA–PtuB complex, activating the PtuB nuclease.

While our manuscript was under revision, Wang et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of the type I-A Retron-Eco4 complex, comprising one RT–msDNA complex and two PtuA–PtuB effector nucleases41. Although the Retron-Eco4 complex is structurally similar to the Retron-Eco7 complex, it cleaves ssDNA, rather than tRNATyr, underscoring the functional diversity within type I-A retrons (Fig. 7b). However, the mechanisms of Retron-Eco4 activation and specific substrate recognition by the two type I-A retron systems remain unknown.

Recent studies reported that the PARIS defense system also targets host tRNA and protects bacterial cells against phage infection46,47,48, illuminating the mechanistic similarities between the Retron-Eco7 and PARIS systems. Furthermore, phage-encoded tRNAs can neutralize both systems, highlighting their biological role in countering bacterial defense systems, as described in recent studies25,49. However, there are notable mechanistic differences between the two systems. In the PARIS system, AriA (the ABC ATPase antitoxin) and AriB (the TOPRIM nuclease toxin) form a supramolecular complex, and the phage-encoded Ocr protein promotes the dissociation of AriB, which subsequently dimerizes and becomes activated to cleave the host tRNALys47,48.

In summary, this study revealed that the Retron-Eco7 system cleaves the host tRNATyr during phage infection and provides anti-phage defense through abortive infection. However, further studies will be needed to understand its mechanism of action, and particularly how the Retron-Eco7 system becomes activated and cleaves tRNATyr.

The SP15 and SP15m phages were isolated and cultivated as previously described25 (Supplementary Data 1). For the spot assay, 300 μL of an overnight culture of E. coli (DH10B) harboring the indicated plasmids (Supplementary Data 1) was mixed with 10 mL of LB top agar (LB medium, 0.5% agarose, and 1 mM CaCl2) and poured onto an LB agar plate. For the spot assays in Figs. 1d, 2h, 4d and i and Supplementary Fig. 1b, c, 0.2% L-arabinose was added to the LB medium at the beginning of the culture to induce constitutive expression of Retron-Eco7. The phage solution was serially diluted tenfold in Sodium-Magnesium (SM) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgSO4, and 0.01% (w/v) gelatin solution). Then, 3 µL of each phage dilution was spotted onto the bacterial lawn. Plates were incubated at room temperature until the spots dried and then at 37 °C overnight. Lysis zones (plaques) were recorded the following day. For Figs. 2h and 4d and i, plaque-forming units (PFU) per volume were quantified and plotted using GraphPad Prism 10 (GraphPad).

E. coli cells containing the indicated plasmids (Supplementary Data 1) were grown at 37 °C overnight in LB medium. The overnight cultures were then diluted 100-fold in LB medium containing 0.1% L-arabinose and, if indicated, infected with phages at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI). A 100 µL aliquot of each diluted culture was transferred to a 96-well plate, which was sealed with a Breathe-Easy sealing membrane (Sigma Aldrich). Growth was monitored at 37 °C for 10 h with shaking, and OD600 values were measured every 20 min using a SpectraMax iD5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Raw data were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism 10.

For the purification of the Retron-Eco7 complex, the gene encoding the ncRNA (144 nt) was amplified by PCR and cloned into a modified pACYCDuet-1 vector (Novagen) to construct pACYC-ncRNA (Supplementary Data 1). The operon encoding the RT (residues 1–311), PtuA (residues 1–550), and PtuB (residues 1–216) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pET28a vector to construct pET-His6-RT–PtuA–PtuB-Twin-strep (PtuB with a C-terminal Twin-strep tag) (Supplementary Data 1). The genes encoding D15 (residues 1–291) and PtuA were individually cloned into a modified pE-SUMO vector with an N-terminal His6-SUMO tag (LifeSensors). To prepare mutants, mutations were introduced using a PCR-based method, and the sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

For the expression of the Retron-Eco7 complex (RT–ncRNA–PtuA–PtuB), E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) cells transformed with pACYC-ncRNA and pET-His6-RT–PtuA–PtuB-Twin-strep were cultured at 37 °C until the OD600 reached 0.8, and protein expression was then induced with 0.2 mM IPTG (Nacalai Tesque). The E. coli cells were further cultured at 18 °C overnight, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM PMSF), and lysed by sonication. The lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to Strep-Tactin XT 4 Flow high-capacity resin (IBA). The complex was then eluted with buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM biotin, 300 mM NaCl, and 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). The complex was purified on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (Cytiva), equilibrated with buffer C (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). To examine the stability of the Retron-Eco7 complex and its mutants, the complexes were purified by Strep-Tactin beads and then analyzed on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva), equilibrated with buffer C (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). The purified complex was stored at −80 °C until use, except for the cryo-EM analysis and tRNA cleavage assays, for which the freshly prepared complex was used without freezing. The protein concentration was measured using the Pierce 660-nm Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The synthetic tRNAs were purchased from Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma.

For the expression of His6-SUMO tagged D15, E. coli Rosetta2 (DE3) (Novagen) cells were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium until the OD600 reached 0.8, and then induced with 0.2 mM IPTG and cultured overnight at 20 °C. The cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer D (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM imidazole, 1 M NaCl, 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM PMSF), and lysed by sonication. The lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to Ni-NTA Superflow resin (QIAGEN) and eluted with buffer E (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, and 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). After treatment with SUMO protease (prepared in-house), the protein was further purified on a HiTrap Heparin column (Cytiva), equilibrated with buffer F (50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM TCEP). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15–2 M NaCl, and then further purified on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column, equilibrated with buffer G (50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). The purified protein was stored at −80 °C until use.

His6-SUMO tagged PtuA was expressed in E. coli and purified using Ni-NTA resin, following the same protocol as for D15. The protein was treated with SUMO protease, and then loaded onto a HiTrap Heparin column, equilibrated with buffer H (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.3–2 M NaCl, and further purified on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva), equilibrated with buffer I (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). The purified protein was stored at −80 °C until use.

The purified RT–msDNA–PtuA–PtuB complex (Retron-Eco7 complex) solution (5.0 mg/mL) was mixed with 0.25% (final concentration) CHAPSO (Nacalai Tesque). The mixture (3 μL) was immediately applied to freshly glow-discharged Au 300 mesh R1.2/1.3 grids (Quantifoil), using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI) at 4 °C, with a waiting time of 10 s and a blotting time of 6 s under 100% humidity conditions. The grids were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane cooled at liquid nitrogen temperature. Cryo-EM data were collected using a Titan Krios G3i microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific), running at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan Quantum-LS Energy Filter (GIF) and a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector in the correlated double sampling mode (The University of Tokyo, Japan). Movies were recorded at a nominal magnification of 105,000×, corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 0.83 Å, with an electron exposure of 7.74 e−/pix/sec for 4.60 s, resulting in an accumulated exposure of 49.7 e−/Å2. The data were automatically acquired by the image shift method using the EPU software (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with a defocus range of −0.8 to −2.0 μm, and 7847 movies were acquired.

Data processing was performed using the cryoSPARC v4.6.2 software package50. Dose-fractionated movies were aligned using Patch motion correction, and the contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were approximated using Patch-Based CTF estimation with the default settings. Particles were automatically picked using Topaz Picker51. The picked particles were divided into five classes (states 1–5) by Heterogeneous Refinement with the default parameters, using the map derived from cryoSPARC Ab initio Reconstruction as the template. For states 1 and 2, masks were generated for the coiled-coil domain to further classify the conformational heterogeneity, and the selected particles after Heterogeneous Refinement were divided into three classes using 3D Classification without alignment. The best classes for states 1–5, containing 67,204, 125,237, 95,729, 93,471, and 180,392 particles, respectively, were refined using Non-uniform Refinement52 following Reference-Based Motion Correction. This refinement yielded maps with 2.75, 2.62, 2.70, 2.67, and 2.58-Å resolutions, respectively, according to the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion53. Local resolution was estimated using BlocRes in cryoSPARC54.

The models of the Retron-Eco7 complex were automatically built using COOT55, starting from a model built by ModelAngelo56. The models were refined using Servalcat57 against unsharpened half maps, with structural restraints from AlphaFold 258 predictions processed by ProSMART59. The models were validated using MolProbity60. The statistics of the 3D reconstruction and model refinement are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The molecular graphics and cryo-EM density map figures were prepared using CueMol (http://www.cuemol.org) or UCSF ChimeraX61.

ATPase activities were measured using an NADH-coupled assay, at 37 °C in a 384-well plate. Each reaction (40 μL) contained 10 mM ATP and either 1 µM purified Retron-Eco7 complex (either WT, PtuA D395A, or PtuB H57A) or 1 µM PtuA alone, in a reaction buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.3 mM NADH, 9 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 60 µg/mL pyruvate kinase, and 32 µg/mL lactate dehydrogenase. Absorbance at 340 nm (A340) was measured every 1 min for 30 min using a SpectraMax iD5 plate reader (Molecular Devices) to monitor NADH oxidation coupled with ATP hydrolysis. Control reactions containing only 10 mM ATP (without protein) were used to correct for background NADH consumption from non-enzymatic ATP degradation. A340 values were converted to NADH concentrations using a calibration curve. ATPase activity (nmol ATP min−1 mg−1 protein) was calculated from the NADH oxidation rate (mM/min), determined from five data points between 15 and 20 min. Data were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism 10.

E. coli (DH10B) cells containing the pBAD-PtuA–PtuB plasmid were grown in 10 mL of LB medium to an OD600 of 0.3. Expression of PtuA–PtuB was induced with 0.2% L-arabinose, and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking at 200 rpm. E. coli cells containing the empty pBAD vector (pKLC23) were used as the control. The cultures were then centrifuged at 6000 × g for 5 min, and the pellets were washed twice with PBS buffer. Total RNA was extracted using an miRNA isolation kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. For total RNA extraction from Retron-Eco7-expressing cells, E. coli cells containing the Retron-Eco7 plasmid or the empty vector (control) were infected with SP15 (MOI = 10) for 20 min. The cultures were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellets were washed twice with SM buffer. Total RNA was extracted using the miRNA isolation kit. The extracted RNA samples were used for tRNA-fragment sequencing.

tRNA-fragment sequencing was performed by Filgen, Inc. and Arraystar Inc. (Project codes: J_041823-tRF&tiRNAseq-8 and J_102623-tRF&tiRNA-seq-8, respectively). Total RNA samples were initially assessed for integrity using agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA concentrations and protein contamination were measured using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and RNA quality was further evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). To ensure efficient library preparation, RNA samples were pretreated to remove specific modifications that could interfere with the process. These treatments included deacylation of 3′-aminoacyl RNA to 3′-OH, removal of 3′-cP (2′,3′-cyclic phosphate) to generate 3′-OH, phosphorylation of 5′-OH to 5′-P, and demethylation of m1A and m3C to facilitate efficient reverse transcription. Library preparation was performed using a NEBNext® Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina® (New England Biolabs). The workflow included 3′-adapter ligation, 5′-adapter ligation, cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification, and size selection of PCR products between 134 and 160 bp, corresponding to 14–40 nt small RNAs. The quality and quantity of the libraries were assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and equal amounts of each library were pooled based on quantification results. The pooled libraries were denatured with 0.1 M NaOH to produce single-stranded DNA molecules, diluted to a final concentration of 1.8 pM, and sequenced on an Illumina platform following the manufacturer's protocols. Sequencing quality was evaluated using FastQC. Adapter sequences were trimmed from raw reads using Cutadapt62. Processed reads were aligned to mature tRNA sequences, allowing for one mismatch. Reads that did not align to mature tRNAs were subsequently mapped to precursor tRNA sequences using Bowtie63. Unmapped reads were further aligned to miRNA reference sequences using miRDeep264. Expression profiles of tRNA-derived fragments were quantified based on the mapped read counts.

E. coli (DH10B) cells containing either the empty vector, the Retron-Eco7 plasmid, or the Retron-Eco7 mutant plasmids were left uninfected or infected with the SP15 or SP15m phage for 20 min (MOI = 10). The cells were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 1 mL of RNA isolation reagent (40% (w/v) phenol, 1% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 2 M guanidine thiocyanate, 0.1% (w/v) 8-quinolinol, 20 mM tri-sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.1 M NaOAc, pH 4.5, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.2% (w/v) N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt, 50 mM salicylic acid, 10 mM aluminon, and 0.0001% (w/v) bromophenol blue). After vigorous shaking at 4 °C for 20 min, chloroform was added to the solution at a concentration of 20%. The mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the aqueous phase was collected. Total RNA was recovered from the aqueous phase by 2-propanol precipitation. Total RNA (4 μg) was resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea, stained with ethidium bromide, blotted onto a nylon membrane (Amersham Hybond N+; Cytiva), dried, and cross-linked by UV (254 nm, 120 mJ/cm2). The DNA probe for each tRNA (Supplementary Data 1) was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P] ATP (PerkinElmer) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo). The membrane was subjected to hybridization at 53 °C overnight in hybridization buffer (500 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 7.5% SDS, 5% polyethylene glycol 6000, 1 mM EDTA-NaOH, pH 8.0, and 0.5% casein) and 4 pmol of 5′-32P-radiolabeled DNA probe. The membrane was washed three times with SSC (150 mM NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0), dried, and exposed to an imaging plate (BAS-MS2040; Fujifilm) to visualize the hybridization bands, using an FLA-7000 imaging analyzer (Cytiva). Uncropped images are available in Source Data.

E. coli cells carrying the Retron-Eco7 plasmid were infected with the SP15m phage (MOI = 1) and cultured overnight in 4 mL of LB medium at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Afterwards, the lysate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min and filtered through a 0.2 μm membrane. To screen for potential escaper phage, 100 μL of the filtered phage solution, containing both wild-type and escaper phages, was mixed with 100 μL of cultured E. coli carrying either the Retron-Eco7 plasmid or the empty vector. The mixture was combined with 4 mL of LB top agar and poured onto LB plates, and the plates were then incubated overnight at 37 °C. Single plaques formed on the Retron-Eco7-containing cells were identified as escaper mutants. To purify these escaper mutants, individual escaping plaques were propagated, and phage titers were subsequently determined using a plaque assay as described previously25. The purified escaper phages were then tested in plaque assays with E. coli cells containing either the Retron-Eco7 plasmid or the empty vector.

High-titer phage lysates (> 107 PFU/mL) of the mutant phages were used for DNA extraction. The phage lysate (500 μL) was treated with DNase I (3 U/mL) and RNase A (20 ng/mL) (both from Takara), and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to degrade bacterial DNA and RNA. Phage DNA was then extracted using a Phage DNA Extraction Kit (Norgen Biotek Corp.) following the manufacturer's protocols. Whole-genome sequencing was performed by Macrogen Japan, Inc. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using CLC Genomic Workbench (QIAGEN), with silent mutations in protein-coding regions excluded from this analysis. The identified escaper phages are listed in Supplementary Data 1.

To examine D15-mediated msDNA cleavage, the purified Retron-Eco7 complex (100 nM) was incubated with the purified WT D15 (100 nM) or its mutants (R86L and R86Q) (100 nM) at 37 °C for 1, 5, and 30 min, in 10 μL of reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT). To examine D15-mediated DNA and RNA cleavage, the purified WT D15 (100 nM) was incubated with either single-stranded DNA (200 nM), double-stranded DNA (200 nM), or single-stranded RNA (200 nM) at 37 °C for 10 min. The reactions were quenched with Proteinase K (Nacalai Tesque) in denaturing buffer containing 7 M urea, and analyzed by 15% urea-PAGE. The gels were stained with SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and then visualized using the FUSION Solo S imaging system (Vilber Bio Imaging). All experiments were performed at least three times.

To investigate the dissociation of the Retron-Eco7 complex by D15 treatment, the purified Retron-Eco7 complex (210 nM) was incubated with the purified WT D15 (210 nM) at 37 °C for 10 min, in 400 μL of reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT). The reaction mixture was then fractionated on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and urea-PAGE. The gels were stained with Bullet CBB Stain One (Nacalai Tesque) and SYBR Gold, respectively, and then visualized using the FUSION Solo S imaging system. All experiments were performed at least three times.

5′-Cy5-labeled Ec-tRNATyr (200 nM) was incubated with the purified Retron-Eco7 complex (500 nM) with or without D15 (500 nM) at 37 °C for 60 min, in 10 μL of reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT). 5′-Cy5-labeled targets (Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma), including Ec-tRNATyr (200 nM), SP-tRNATyr (200 nM), ssDNA (200 nM), dsDNA (200 nM), or ssRNA (200 nM), were also incubated with the Retron-Eco7 complex (250, 500, or 1000 nM) at 37 °C for 60 min. The reactions were quenched with Proteinase K in denaturing buffer containing 7 M urea, and then analyzed on 15% urea-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). The tRNAs and their fragments were visualized by the Cy5 fluorescence with the FUSION Solo S system. All experiments were performed at least three times.

E. coli (DH10B) cells, containing either the arabinose-inducible Retron-Eco7 (pKLC23-Eco7) or the arabinose-inducible PtuA and PtuB (pKLC23-PtuA–PtuB), along with the anhydrotetracycline-inducible D15 (pKLC83-D15) plasmid (Supplementary Data 1), were cultured overnight. The cultures were then serially diluted tenfold in LB medium. A 3 μL aliquot of each dilution was spotted onto LB agar plates. Expression of Retron-Eco7 or PtuA–PtuB, and D15 was induced by supplementing the plates with 0.2% L-arabinose and 50 ng/mL anhydrotetracycline, respectively. The empty pKLC23 and pKLC83 vectors were used as controls. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and colony growth was evaluated the following day.

Sample sizes were determined based on those used in our previous studies and similar published work that yielded reproducible results. For cryo-EM analyses, particle images that did not improve map quality were excluded using standard classification procedures in cryoSPARC. All biochemical, cellular, and functional assays were conducted with independent replicates following widely accepted protocols in the field (three biological or technical replicates unless otherwise stated). Data are generally presented as the mean ± SD of three or four independent replicates (n  =  3 or 4), and no statistical analysis was performed. All experiments were independently repeated at least three times with similar results, confirming reproducibility. No randomization was performed for biochemical and cellular experiments because these assays involve inherently uniform and controllable samples, such as purified proteins or cell cultures, where variability is minimal compared with live animals. No blinding was performed for biochemical and cellular experiments, as these experiments involve objective measurements under controlled conditions that are not influenced by subjective assessments.

Piperidine and pyridine are nitrogen heterocyclic motifs prominently used in pharmaceuticals and consequently of great importance. The direct reduction of planar pyridines into piperidines with high sp3-carbon content is highly attractive as this offers a route to producing high-value products and broadening the structural space. However, direct hydrogenation of pyridines with homogeneous catalysts is challenging due to their aromatic stability and catalyst-poisoning abilities. Here we describe a robust and selective iridium(III)-catalysed ionic hydrogenation of pyridines to corresponding functionalized piperidines. Important highly reduction-sensitive groups, including nitro, azido, bromo, alkenyl and alkynyl, are inert, enabling access to a broad range of multisubstituted piperidines in high yields, substantially expanding the available chemical space for this relevant scaffold. The method requires low catalyst loadings, is scalable to decagrams and delivers the most synthetically valuable free secondary amines as easily isolable and stable piperidinium salts. Applied in a complex late-stage setting, the pyridine motif in several FDA-approved drugs was successfully and selectively hydrogenated.

Last April, neuroscientist Sue Grigson received an e-mail from a man detailing his years-long struggle to kick addiction — first to opioids, and then to the very medication meant to help him quit.

The man had stumbled on research by Grigson, suggesting that certain anti-obesity medications could help to reduce rats' addiction to drugs such as heroin and fentanyl. He decided to try quitting again, this time while taking semaglutide, the blockbuster GLP-1 drug better known as Ozempic. “That's when he wrote to me,” says Grigson, who works at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine in Hershey. “He said that he was drug- and alcohol-free for the first time in his adult life.”

Why do obesity drugs seem to treat so many other ailments?

Why do obesity drugs seem to treat so many other ailments?

Stories like this have been spreading fast in the past few years, through online forums, weight-loss clinics and news headlines. They describe people taking diabetes and weight-loss drugs such as semaglutide (also marketed as Wegovy) and tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro or Zepbound) who find themselves suddenly able to shake long-standing addictions to cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs. And now, clinical data are starting to back them up.

Earlier this year, a team led by Christian Hendershot, a psychologist now at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, reported in a landmark randomized trial that weekly injections of semaglutide cut alcohol consumption1 — a key demonstration that GLP-1 drugs can alter addictive behaviour in people with a substance-use disorder. More than a dozen randomized clinical studies testing GLP-1 drugs for addiction are now under way worldwide, with some results expected in the next few months.

Neuroscientists, meanwhile, are working out how the weight-loss drugs suppress addiction by acting on hormone receptors in brain regions that control craving, reward and motivation. They are finding that GLP-1 therapies help to blunt urges for alcohol, opioids, nicotine and cocaine through some of the same brain pathways that also quell hunger cues and overeating. “At the end of the day, the neurobiological system that is activated by rewarding substances — food, sex, drugs, rock and roll — it's the same system,” says Roger McIntyre, a psychopharmacologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. And some researchers are testing whether, by influencing reward-related brain circuits, the drugs might help with dementia and depression as well.

Obesity drugs aren't always forever. What happens when you quit?

Obesity drugs aren't always forever. What happens when you quit?

The research is still in its early stages, scientists warn. “We first need to find out if it's efficacious and safe,” says W. Kyle Simmons, a neuroimaging specialist at Oklahoma State University in Tulsa, who is leading a GLP-1 trial for alcohol reduction.

But some researchers and physicians are excited. No truly new class of addiction medicine has won approval from regulators in decades, says Elisabet Jerlhag Holm, an addiction biologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. If GLP-1 drugs prove effective in bigger trials, she says, “it's a revolution”.

It took some years for the current buzz around GLP-1 drugs in addiction medicine to build. Researchers originally developed them to control blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes by mimicking the hormone GLP-1. Soon it became clear that the drugs could curb appetite and promote weight loss, too. They act on hormone receptors located in the pancreas and gut — where they help to regulate blood sugar and signal fullness — but also in key regions of the brain that control reward and motivation, dialling down the urge for tasty, calorie-laden food.

By the early 2010s, Jerlhag Holm was wondering whether the drugs could blunt other urges. She published a trio of papers showing that they could dampen cravings in rats and mice hooked on alcohol2, nicotine3 and stimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine4. Her team also showed5 that GLP-1 therapy could reduce animal behaviours that resemble relapse, which is when people return to drugs after a period of abstinence.

Yet her findings barely registered among addiction researchers, she says, and pharmaceutical companies showed no interest either. “I was quite alone for a long time,” says Jerlhag Holm.

But Lorenzo Leggio, a physician-scientist at the US National Institutes of Health in Baltimore, Maryland, noticed the work. He had also been following clues that GLP-1 might influence addictive behaviour and, in 2015, joined forces with Jerlhag Holm to uncover the first evidence of a connection between the hormone and alcohol dependence in humans. The team found that a common variant of the GLP-1 receptor gene was linked to heavier drinking6.

Using post-mortem human brain tissue, Leggio's lab later showed that people with alcohol-use disorder have elevated levels of GLP-1 receptors in key reward-related regions of the brain7. Leggio suspects that this reflects an adaptive response: alcohol dampens the body's GLP-1 production, and so the brain boosts expression of the hormone's receptors to preserve sensitivity to it in circuits that govern reward and motivation.

These results, together with a growing number of animal studies, solidified GLP-1's connection to addictive behaviour. Yet it was not until May 2023 that the story spilled into the public eye. The Atlantic magazine published an article about people taking semaglutide who said their urge to smoke or drink had faded. ‘Did Scientists Accidentally Invent an Anti-addiction Drug?' it was headlined. “That was definitely a turning point,” says Leggio, who suddenly found himself getting calls from journalists.

The first few rigorous trials, however, had largely disappointing results. A 2022 study in Denmark, led by psychiatrist Anders Fink-Jensen at the University of Copenhagen, found that weekly treatment with exenatide — a ‘first-generation' GLP-1 compound used since 2005 to treat diabetes but never approved for weight loss — did not substantially reduce the number of heavy drinking days in people diagnosed with alcohol dependence8. A 2023 trial in Switzerland likewise found that dulaglutide, another older GLP-1 drug, did not help people to quit smoking9.

But other results suggested that the drugs might have an effect. In a trial10 involving 20 people with opioid-use disorder, led by Grigson and psychologist Scott Bunce, also at Pennsylvania State University, treatment with liraglutide — another first-generation GLP-1 drug — reduced opioid craving by roughly 40%. And when Fink-Jensen's team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at the brains of people taking exenatide in their clinical trial, they saw muted activity in reward-related regions when the participants viewed images of alcoholic drinks8.

But the first-generation drugs tested in these preliminary studies are much less potent than agents such as semaglutide or tirzepatide. These second-generation compounds bind more tightly to the GLP-1 receptor, stay active in the body for longer and have shown greater benefits across a range of health conditions. So, could these latest drugs change the behaviour of people struggling with substance misuse?

That's what researchers are now examining in a raft of clinical trials with hotly anticipated results. Fink-Jensen and his colleagues have already tested whether the high dose of semaglutide approved for weight loss can cut alcohol intake in 108 people with alcohol-use disorder and obesity, in a clinical trial that wrapped up earlier this year. He says the results should be published in early 2026.

In the United States, meanwhile, Leggio and Simmons are each leading independent but coordinated randomized trials testing injected semaglutide in moderate-to-heavy drinkers who meet the diagnostic criteria for problematic alcohol use. Leggio's trial will involve 52 people and test the high-dose Wegovy form of the drug, whereas Simmons's trial, involving 80 people, is testing the lower-dose Ozempic, typically prescribed for diabetes. And psychologist Joseph Schacht at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora has been running his own alcohol trial with the oral version of semaglutide (marketed as Rybelsus). By coordinating their efforts, the three teams hope to tease apart how differences in dose and delivery affect outcomes.

Schacht says that the pills, although less potent than injections, could be more appealing to people with alcohol addiction, many of whom also have a history of using injectable drugs such as fentanyl. “They can be gun-shy around needles, because that is a cue related to injection drug use,” he says.

In all of these trials of semaglutide for alcohol dependence, the research teams are also using fMRI to capture before-and-after snapshots of the brain to show how the drug alters responses to alcohol-related prompts, such as drinks or photos. This could reveal whether and how the drug disrupts the brain's drive for alcohol — the reward-seeking sense of ‘wanting' that fuels addiction. The imaging results might also show brain activity patterns that are more common in people who benefit from GLP-1 therapy than in those who don't. “It may give us a better understanding for whom the drug works best,” Simmons says.

Researchers are already piecing together a picture of how GLP-1 drugs act on the brain's reward system. They know from animal models that rewarding substances — alcohol, nicotine, opioids, food — activate similar neural circuitry. This links deep brain structures such as the ventral tegmental area, where neurons that synthesize the neurotransmitter dopamine originate, to the nucleus accumbens, where dopamine signals arrive and register as pleasure. Normally, every sip, puff or hit sends a jolt of rewarding dopamine through this circuit, teaching the brain to want more and reinforcing addictive behaviour.

GLP-1 receptors sit on neurons throughout this network and, when triggered, are thought to reduce the flow of dopamine and other chemical messages to make rewarding experiences feel less compelling. When drugs such as semaglutide mimic GLP-1, they blunt the dopamine response and the compulsion to repeat the addictive behaviour fades away.

Stress responses come into play as well, animal studies show. When drugs activate GLP-1 receptors in brain regions such as the amygdala, they help to mute the surge of stress hormones that accompany anxiety, withdrawal and craving. This dual action — calming both the urge and the unease — could help to explain why the therapies seem to reduce not only consumption but also relapse, at least in rodents.

The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) influences Southern Hemisphere temperature and precipitation, ocean circulation, carbon cycling and the Antarctic cryosphere. In this Review, we examine the dynamics, projections and effects of the SAM, focusing on future implications for the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. The SAM is the leading mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics, associated with variations in the mid-latitude westerly jet strength and position. The SAM is primarily an internally driven atmospheric process, for which anomalies dissipate in 1–2 weeks; however, sustained SAM anomalies can also be forced by stratospheric processes and tropical Pacific variability. Ozone depletion during the 1970s–1990s contributed to large positive trends in austral summer. The SAM is now in its most positive mean state in over 1,000 years, and a year-round positive trend in the SAM is projected to continue throughout the twenty-first century in response to increasing greenhouse gases. Given the importance of SAM effects on Southern Ocean circulation, carbon cycling, and Antarctic ice mass balance for future climate and sea level rise projections, it is crucial that the effects of SAM are better modelled and understood, including accounting for the influence of the shifting seasonality of positive SAM trends and its increasing asymmetry.

A climatological persistent low-pressure centre located in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean off the coast of West Antarctica, over the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas.

A cold, dense water mass formed near Antarctica from dense shelf water that sinks and spreads along the ocean floor into the deepest parts of the global ocean; it has a key role in global meridional ocean circulation and climate regulation.

A major eastwards-flowing ocean current that encircles Antarctica, connecting the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, thereby facilitating the global exchange of heat, freshwater and nutrients.

A high-latitude westwards-flowing current on the edge of the Antarctic continental shelf that encircles most of the continent and forms a boundary between the open ocean and continental shelf waters, regulating the transport of water towards the continent.

A band of strong winds blowing from the west to the east, encircling the mid-latitude to sub-Antarctic region in the stratosphere (~10–55 km altitudes), typically present from austral late autumn to late spring.

Carbon within the atmospheric, oceanic or terrestrial realm that is of anthropogenic origin.

The photosynthetic pigment contained in land plants and ocean phytoplankton, used here as a proxy for phytoplankton abundance and, approximately, ocean productivity.

A water mass that upwells to the near surface of the polar and subpolar Southern Ocean, consisting of a blend of deep water masses from the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific ocean basins, with about half sourced from North Atlantic deep water.

(CMIP6). The internationally coordinated set of defined climate model experiments and shared model outputs from modelling groups around the world.

A dense water mass formed on the Antarctic continental shelf through sea ice production whose temperature is therefore the local freezing temperature and its density is set by its salinity.

The sum of bicarbonate (HCO3−) and carbonate (CO32) ions, plus aqueous CO2 (CO2(aq)), also referred to as carbonic acid, H2CO3.

A transient disturbance that deviates from the mean flow in the atmosphere or ocean (includes cyclones and anticyclones in the atmosphere).

The net transfer of zonal momentum from atmospheric eddies into the mean flow, resulting in westerly acceleration of the zonal-mean flow caused by the propagation of waves away from their source region.

The net removal of zonal momentum from the mean flow by atmospheric eddies, corresponding to deceleration of the zonal-mean flow due to breaking waves.

Also termed Ekman drift; a wind-driven flow of water in the upper surface layer of the ocean resulting from a combination of wind drag and the Coriolis effect, which deflects the flow to the left of the wind in the Southern Hemisphere, and to the right of the wind in the Northern Hemisphere.

(ENSO). A naturally occurring fluctuation in sea surface temperatures coupled with winds and pressure across the tropical Pacific Ocean, associated with sustained warming (El Niño) or cooling (La Niña) in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, typically occurring every 2–7 years.

The mid-latitude component of the extratropical mean meridional circulation, consisting of poleward flow near the surface, upwards motion near the mid-latitude jet, equatorward flow aloft and subsidence in the subtropics.

Also termed Hadley cell; the thermally driven mean meridional circulation characterized by rising warm, moist air in the tropics; poleward motion aloft; sinking cooler, drier air in the subtropics; and equatorward flow at the surface, transporting energy, momentum and moisture between these regions.

A naturally occurring decadal-to-multidecadal fluctuation of Pacific sea surface temperatures, coupled with atmospheric circulation, with a spatial pattern resembling ENSO but extending into the extratropical Pacific.

A pulse of tropical convective activity (cloud and rainfall) that propagates eastwards near the equator, from the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific Ocean, with a cycle repeating approximately every 30–60 days.

A band of strong westerly winds extending from the surface to the upper troposphere in the mid-to-high latitudes of both hemispheres, driven by eddy momentum flux convergence. Unlike the subtropical jet, the mid-latitude eddy-driven jet arises from the cumulative effect of eddies rather than a coherent flow.

Carbon within the atmosphere, oceanic or terrestrial realm that has not been affected by anthropogenic emissions of carbon, considered equivalent to pre-industrial carbon.

The balance of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions with equivalent uptake of carbon from the atmosphere through anthropogenic activities (sometimes net-zero emissions are used to refer to all greenhouse gases rather than just carbon dioxide).

A Rossby wave train that extends from the central Pacific Ocean to the Amundsen and Weddell seas, manifesting across intraseasonal to decadal timescales.

Large-scale (planetary) or synoptic-scale waves in the atmosphere that arise from the variation of the Coriolis effect with latitude.

A band of strong westerly winds located in the upper troposphere of the subtropics on the poleward side of the Hadley cell of both hemispheres, peaking in winter.

The net effect of ice sheet mass gain due to precipitation, and mass loss primarily by temperature-driven surface melt.

No, it does not. This article first says that normally you would run an application and the database on separate servers and then starts measuring the performance of a locally embedded database. If you have to keep the initial requirement for your software, then SQLite is completely out of equation. If you can change the requirement, then you can achieve similar performance by tuning the local PGSQL instance -- and then it also becomes a valuation of features and not just raw throughput. I'm not saying SQLite is not an option either, but this article seems confusing in that it compares two different problems/solutions.

reply

It'd be a very short article if so, don't you think? Full article would be something like: "Normally you'd have a remote connection to the database, and since we're supposed to test SQLite's performance, and SQLite is embedded, it doesn't compare. Fin"

The other thing to point out is in this article is that the PG network example CANNOT scale horizontally due to the power law. You can throw a super cluster at the problem and still fundamentally do around 1000 TPS.

3x EX44 running Patroni + PostgreSQL would give you 64GB of working memory, at least 512 GB NVMe of dataset (configurable with more for a one-time fee) at HA + 1 maintenance node. Practically speaking, that would have carried the first 5 - 10 years of production at the company I work at with ease, for 120 Euros hardware cost/month + a decent sysadmin.I also know quite a few companies who toss 3-4x 20k - 30k at DELL every few years to get a database cluster on-prem so that database performance ceases to be a problem (unless the application has bad queries).

No one has solved this problem. Scale out is typically more elastic, at least for reads.

Does my data fit in RAM? https://yourdatafitsinram.net/Not sure using EC2/AWS/Amazon is a good example here, if you're squeezing for large single-node performance you most certainly go for dedicated servers, or at least avoid vCPUs like a plague.

A sqlite related issue I ran into had to do with accessing the SQLite database from multiple threads. Found out a solution easily: for multi-threading use, SQLite needed to be initialized with a `SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX` flag. Since then, the website has been running seamlessly for about 3 weeks now.

Seattle biotech startup Curi Bio, which enables the screening of new drugs using cells and 3D tissue models derived from human cells, announced $10 million in new funding. 

Curi Bio's customers include large biopharmaceutical and biotech companies such Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Astrazeneca, Pfizer, Boehringer Ingelheim, UCB, Novartis and others. Its Series B round was led by Seoul-based DreamCIS, which supports biopharma R&D through extensive research services.

“We are thrilled to partner with DreamCIS, who shares our conviction that drug discovery urgently needs more human-relevant data at the preclinical stage,” said Michael Cho, Curi Bio's chief strategy officer, in a statement. “The vast majority of new drugs fail in human clinical trials because preclinical animal and 2D cell models have failed to be good predictors of human outcomes.”

Curi Bio's platform integrates bioengineered tissues created from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with data collection and analysis. The additional funding will expedite its development of new platforms for cardiac, skeletal muscle, metabolic, smooth muscle and neuromuscular diseases, the company said. 

The Seattle area is a hub of life science and biotech companies, including numerous efforts focused on AI-assisted research. Researchers have emphasized the need to test computer-generated drug candidates in the lab to verify their capabilities and impacts.

“Curi Bio's unique integration of cells, systems, and data is a paradigm shift for preclinical drug discovery,” said Jeounghee Yoo, CEO of DreamCIS. “We were incredibly impressed by the company's innovative platforms and their ability to generate functional data from 3D human tissues at scale.”

Curi Bio has raised more than $32 million from investors and $12 million from federal grants. 

The company spun out of the University of Washington a decade ago as NanoSurface Biomedical. In April, Curi Bio celebrated the opening of its new 13,942-square-foot headquarters and research facility on the Seattle waterfront.

Yoodli is on a roll. 

The Seattle startup, which sells AI-powered software to help people practice real-world conversations such as sales calls and feedback sessions, announced a $40 million Series B round on Tuesday to fuel growth. WestBridge Capital, a $7 billion global investment firm, led the round. 

The fresh funding comes less than a year after the company's $13.7 million Series A round in May. 

Yoodli's software lets users create personas to simulate conversations with another person or multiple people. The company's model is trained on effective communication techniques and can be customized depending on an organization's goals. Customers include SAP, Google, Snowflake, the University of Washington, Korn Ferry, and others. 

“At a moment when AI is replacing human jobs, we're doubling down on a different belief: that AI should help people become the best version of themselves in the conversations that matter most,” co-founder and CEO Varun Puri wrote on LinkedIn. 

Yoodli's revenue has grown around 900% in the past year. Its headcount has tripled to more than 40 people.

Puri told GeekWire earlier this year that Yoodli is like a “batting cage before game time,” or a flight simulator for communication. The idea is to replace passive formats such as slide decks and training videos with interactive practice that builds conversational muscle memory.

The company said it will use the new funding to expand into what it calls “experiential learning.”

“Experiential learning is the next step of conversation coaching — helping people learn, practice, and apply skills with roleplays at the center of their experience,” Puri wrote. “We're making learning more fun and actionable for individuals and much more closely tied to ROI for organizations.”

The raise comes amid competition in the AI-powered workforce training market, as employers look for tools to upskill workers in communication, leadership, and customer engagement — areas where traditional learning management systems may have limitations.

Puri and Esha Joshi launched Yoodli in 2021 at the AI2 incubator in Seattle. The startup got off the ground with a consumer-focused offering targeted at practicing public speaking. 

Neotribe and Madrona also participated in the latest funding round. Total capital raised is nearly $60 million.

LAS VEGAS — Amazon is pitching a future where AI works while humans sleep, announcing a collection of what it calls “frontier agents” capable of handling complex, multi-day projects without needing a human to be constantly involved.

The announcement Tuesday at the Amazon Web Services re:Invent conference is an attempt by the cloud giant to leapfrog Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, OpenAI, and others as the industry moves beyond interactive AI assistants toward fully autonomous digital workers.

The rollout features three specialized agents: A virtual developer for Amazon's Kiro coding platform that navigates multiple code repositories to fix bugs; a security agent that actively tests applications for vulnerabilities; and a DevOps agent that responds to system outages. 

Unlike standard AI chatbots that reset after each session, Amazon says the frontier agents have long-term memory and can work for hours or days to solve ambiguous problems.

“You could go to sleep and wake up in the morning, and it's completed a bunch of tasks,” said Deepak Singh, AWS vice president of developer agents and experiences, in an interview. 

Amazon is starting with the agents focused on software development, but Singh made it clear that it's just the beginning of a larger long-term rollout of similar agents. 

“The term is broad,” he said. “It can be applied in many, many domains.”

During the opening keynote Tuesday morning, AWS CEO Matt Garman said believes AI agents represent an “inflection point” in AI development, transforming AI from a “technical wonder” into something that delivers real business value.

In the future, Garman said, “there's going to be millions of agents inside of every company across every imaginable field.”

To keep frontier agents from breaking critical systems, Amazon says humans remain the gatekeepers. The DevOps agent stops short of making fixes automatically, instead generating a detailed “mitigation plan” that an engineer approves. The Kiro developer agent submits its work as proposed pull requests, ensuring a human reviews the code before it's merged.

Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic and others are all moving in a similar direction. Microsoft's GitHub Copilot is becoming a multi-agent system, Google is adding autonomous features to Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude Code is designed to handle extended coding tasks. 

Amazon is announcing the frontier agents during the opening keynote by AWS CEO Matt Garman at re:Invent, its big annual conference. The DevOps and security agents are available in public preview starting Tuesday; the Kiro developer agent will roll out in the coming months.

Some of the other notable announcements at re:Invent today:

AI Factories: AWS will ship racks of its servers directly to customer data centers to run as a private “AI Factory,” in its words. This matters for governments and banks, for example, that want modern AI tools but are legally restricted from moving sensitive data off-premises.

New AI Models: Amazon announced Nova 2, the next generation of the generative AI models it first unveiled here a year ago. They include a “Pro” model for complex reasoning, a “Sonic” model for natural voice conversations, and a new “Omni” model that processes text, audio, and video simultaneously.

Custom Models: Amazon introduced Nova Forge, a tool that lets companies build their own high-end AI models from scratch by combining their private data with Amazon's own datasets. It's designed for businesses that find standard models too generic but lack the resources to build one entirely alone.

Trainium: Amazon released its newest home-grown AI processor, Trainium 3, which it says is roughly 4x faster and 40% more efficient than the previous version. It's central to Amazon's strategy to lower the cost of training AI and provide a cheaper alternative to Nvidia GPUs. Executives also previewed Trainium 4, promising to double energy efficiency again.

Killing “Tech Debt”: AWS expanded its Transform service to rewrite and modernize code from basically any source, including proprietary languages. The tool uses AI agents to analyze and convert these custom legacy systems into modern languages, a process Amazon claims is up to five times faster than manual coding.

New research shows that terminally ill baby ants tell other ants to kill them, potentially protecting the rest of the colony from their infection.

In a study published today in the journal Nature Communications, researchers revealed that ant pupae—what a larva grows into before becoming an adult—of the Lasius neglectus ant species actively produce a chemical signal that causes other colony members to destroy them. The findings further solidify the view of an ant colony as a “superorganism” behaving as a single entity rather than a community of many individuals.

“Sick individuals often conceal their disease status to group members, thereby preventing social exclusion or aggression,” the researchers wrote in the paper. On the other hand, researchers have documented sick adult ants leaving their colony to avoid spreading their disease. Pupae, however, are encased in a cocoon and cannot leave, so they resort to a rather extreme strategy—emitting a chemical signal essentially calling for self-destruction.

“Adult ants that approach death leave the nest to die outside the colony. Similarly, workers that have been exposed to fungal spores practice social distancing,” Sylvia Cremer, co-author of the study and group leader of the Cremer Group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), said in an ISTA statement. “Yet, this is only possible for mobile individuals. Ant brood within the colony, like infected cells in tissue, are largely immobile and lack this option.”

Once worker ants receive the signal, they take the pupae from the cocoon, punch holes into them, and inject them with formic acid—an antimicrobial poison that works like a self-produced disinfectant. This kills the pathogens but also the pupae.

While previous research had demonstrated that worker ants can recognize sick pupae and kill them to disinfect the nest, scientists didn't know if passive cues or intentional signaling by the sick pupae triggered this dynamic. To shed light on the matter, the scientists behind the new study infected Lasius neglectus ants with a fungal pathogen.

During the experiment, sick worker pupae emitted a modified body smell (the chemical signal) that warned the adult ants to destroy them. Only sick ants near adult worker ants produced this signal, indicating that the cue isn't just an immune response or side effect of infection. When the researchers applied the smell to healthy pupae, they were also destroyed, confirming the chemical's role in triggering the response.

Because workers destroy specific pupae within an entire brood (eggs, larvae, and pupae) pile, “the scent cannot simply diffuse through the nest chamber but must be directly associated with the diseased pupa,” explained Thomas Schmitt, co-author of the study and a chemical ecologist from the University of Würzburg. “Accordingly, the signal does not consist of volatile compounds but instead is made up of non-volatile compounds on the pupal body surface.”

While colonies are technically communities made of many individual ants, they work as a single superorganism. Ants within a colony are like the cells in our body. For example, ant queens are responsible for producing offspring, and non-fertile workers are responsible for the colony's maintenance and health. Similarly, our germline cells are responsible for the production of offspring, and our somatic cells execute all the other important tasks. Along those same lines, the signaling from terminally ill pupae mirrors the way our body's cells release chemical cues—called the “find-me and eat-me signal”—for our immune cells, which then identify and destroy the signaling cells to eliminate the risk of infection.

For ants, “what appears to be self-sacrifice at first glance is, in fact, also beneficial to the signaler: it safeguards its nestmates, with whom it shares many genes. By warning the colony of their deadly infection, terminally ill ants help the colony remain healthy and produce daughter colonies, which indirectly pass on the signaler's genes to the next generation,” explained Erika Dawson, first author of the study and a behavioral ecologist at ISTA. If a terminally ill ant pretended to be healthy and died, it could become infectious and endanger the whole colony.

Interestingly, the researchers did not observe queen pupae emit the chemical signal. They have stronger immune defenses than worker pupae and can restrict the infection independently. Worker pupae, however, couldn't control the infection and warned the colony.

Sick pupae only emit the signal when the infection is uncontrollable, empowering fellow ants to intervene in situations of real threats while avoiding the destruction of pupae that can recover. “This precise coordination between the individual and colony level is what makes this altruistic disease signaling so effective,” Cremer concluded.

Amazon Web Services, which has been building its own AI training chips for years now, just introduced a new version known as Trainium3 that comes with some impressive specs.

The cloud provider, which made the announcement Tuesday at AWS re:Invent 2025, also teased the next product on its AI training product roadmap: Trainium4, which is already in the works and will be able to work with Nvidia's chips.

AWS used its annual tech conference to formally launch Trainium3 UltraServer, a system powered by the company's state-of-the art, 3 nanometer Trainium3 chip, as well as its homegrown networking tech. As you might expect, the third-generation chip and system offer big bumps in performance for AI training and inference over the second-generation chip, according to AWS.

AWS says the system is more than 4x faster, with 4x more memory, not just for training, but for delivering AI apps at peak demand. Additionally, thousands of UltraServers can be linked together to provide an app with up to 1 million Trainium3 chips — 10x the previous generation. Each UltraServer can host 144 chips, according to the company. 

Perhaps more importantly, AWS says the chips and systems are also 40% more energy efficient than the previous generation. While the world races to build bigger data centers powered by astronomical gigawatts of electricity, data center giant AWS is trying to make systems that drink less, not more.

It is, obviously, in AWS's direct interests to do so. But in its classic, Amazon cost-conscious way, it promises that these systems save its AI cloud customers money, too.  

AWS customers like Anthropic (of which Amazon is also an investor), Japan's LLM Karakuri, SplashMusic, and Decart have already been using the third-gen chip and system and significantly cut their inference costs, Amazon said. 

AWS also presented a bit of a roadmap for the next chip, Trainium4, which is already in development. AWS promised the chip will provide another big step up in performance and support Nvidia's NVLink Fusion high-speed chip interconnect technology.  

This means the AWS Trainium4-powered systems will be able to interoperate and extend their performance with Nvidia GPUs while still using Amazon's homegrown, lower-cost server rack technology.  

It's worth noting, too, that Nvidia's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) has become the de facto standard that all the major AI apps are built to support. The Trainium4-powered systems may make it easier to woo big AI apps built with Nvidia GPUs in mind to Amazon's cloud.

Amazon did not announce a timeline for Trainium4. If the company follows previous rollout timelines, we'll likely hear more about Trainium4 at next year's conference.

Amazon has announced a new family of frontier artificial intelligence models—and a new way for customers to build frontier models of their own.

The ecommerce giant announced the second generation of its Nova AI models at re:Invent, a company conference held in Las Vegas. The models are nowhere near as popular as those offered by rivals like OpenAI and Google, but Amazon's plan to make them highly customizable could see them gain traction with its cloud users.

Amazon detailed two improved large language models, Nova Lite and Nova Pro, a new real-time voice model called Nova Sonic, and a more experimental model called Nova Omni that performs a simulated kind of reasoning using images, audio, and video as well as text. The new models are being made available today to a limited number of customers.

More significantly, given the importance of its cloud business, Amazon is releasing a tool called Nova Forge that will let customers create specialized frontier models by adding their own training data to unfinished versions of the Nova 2 Lite and Pro models.

It is already possible to fine-tune off-the-shelf AI models like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT. But Amazon's approach lets customers add data at various stages of model training, including the process of building the base model, a stage known as custom pretraining that is normally reserved for large AI labs.

“Everyone is looking for a frontier model that's an expert in their domain,” Rohit Prasad, who leads Amazon's AI efforts, told WIRED ahead of today's announcements. Prasad says that Amazon developed the technologies behind Nova Forge to empower internal teams, including those developing Alexa and AI agents to build custom models. “This is essentially a new open training paradigm,” he says.

One customer that has tested the approach is Reddit, which used Nova Forge to create a custom model to identify content that breaks the platform's rules.

Fine-tuning a conventional model would not work, says Reddit chief technology officer Chris Slowe, because most models are designed to avoid offensive or violent content entirely, meaning they would refuse to analyze some materials. Slowe says that custom pre-training, combined with conventional fine-tuning, produced a frontier model that is expert at understanding and using Reddit.

“Other LLMs understand Reddit as a concept, and how Reddit works, but they're not down in the weeds,” Slowe says. “We really built a Reddit expert model.”

Slowe adds that Reddit's customized model could have a range of uses, and will most likely be put to work next to automate content moderation.

Other companies testing Nova Forge include Booking.com, Sony, and Nimbus Therapeutics, a biotech firm.

Allowing customers to craft specialized models may prove savvy as companies look for tools that go beyond the capabilities of the latest general-purpose models. About three-quarters of US companies see AI as a high priority, according to a survey from the consulting company Bain released in November. Those companies also, however, report a wide range of problems in using AI, among them a lack of expertise and resources needed to build custom models.

Today most AI models are either closed, meaning they can only be accessed through API or app, or open, meaning they can be downloaded and run on one's own hardware. Many companies opt to work with open models—the most popular being ones that come from Chinese companies, like Alibaba and DeepSeek—because they are cheaper to experiment with and can be modified with relative ease. The data used to train these open models is typically not released, however, which limits and complicates the process of tuning them.

Nova Forge offers a new approach, albeit one that is locked into Amazon's cloud. Building a large language model from scratch can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Prasad says a frontier model built using Nova Forge should be significantly cheaper, without providing specifics.

Amazon remains something of a dark horse in the AI race, having been relatively late to develop truly cutting-edge AI language models. The company is, however, quietly building up a portfolio of advanced AI capabilities. It has also integrated generative AI into its shopping platform, for example through an ecommerce-focused chatbot helper called Rufus.

Like other big tech companies, Amazon is investing billions to build new AI infrastructure, part of a colossal—and potentially risky—bet that demand for AI will continue to grow at an impressive clip.

Amazon is competing with Google and Microsoft for cloud customers. OpenAI is also rapidly building its own infrastructure and could someday become a cloud player itself. It has hedged its bets by investing $8 billion in Anthropic, a major competitor to OpenAI founded by staff who left the maker of ChatGPT. Amazon is also looking to challenge Nvidia's hardware dominance; Anthropic's latest models are trained on Amazon's custom Trainium chips.

Amazon says Nova 2 Pro matches or exceeds OpenAI's GPT-5 and GPT-5.1, Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 and Gemini 3.0 Pro, and Sonnet 4.5 from Anthropic across a range of benchmarks. Prasad notes that the model is especially good at agentic tasks like following complex instructions and using tools on a computer. The company says that its smaller model, Nova 2 Lite, is similar to Claude 4.5 Haiku, GPT-5 Mini, and Gemini Flash 2.5 on various benchmarks.

Nova 2 Omni shows that Amazon is no slouch in AI research these days. A fully multimodal reasoning model, it can take images, audio, and video as well as text as input and can perform simulated reasoning to generate output. Prasad says to his knowledge no other AI company has released a fully mutli-model of this kind.

Reddit's Slowe says the customizable nature of Nova is probably its most important quality. “I do believe it has a lot of potential,” he says. “For a large set of situations, it will be substantially better than what we get off the shelf.”

You might think Amazon's biggest swing in the AI race was its $8 billion investment in Anthropic. But AWS has also been building in-house foundation models, new chips, massive data centers, and agents meant to keep enterprise customers locked inside its ecosystem. The company believes these offerings will give it an edge as businesses of all shapes and sizes deploy AI in the real world.

WIRED sat down with AWS CEO Matt Garman ahead of the company's annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas to discuss his AI vision, and how he plans to extend Amazon's lead in the cloud market over its fast-rising competitors, Microsoft and Google.

Garman is betting that AI is a service that AWS can deliver more cheaply and reliably than its rivals. Through Bedrock, Amazon's platform for building AI apps, he says customers can access a variety of AI foundation models while keeping the familiar data controls, security layers, and reliability that AWS is known for. If that pitch holds up, it could help AWS dominate in the AI era.

“Two years ago, people were building AI applications. Now, people are building applications that have AI in them,” said Garman, arguing that AI is becoming a feature inside large products rather than a standalone experiment. “That's the platform that we've built, and that's where I think you see AWS really start to take the lead.”

Many of the announcements at this year's re:Invent fall along these lines. Amazon unveiled new, cost-efficient AI models in its Nova series; agents that can work autonomously on software development and cybersecurity tasks; as well as a fresh offering, Forge, that lets enterprises cheaply train AI models on their own data.

The stakes are high for AWS to get this right. While Amazon's cloud unit dominated the smartphone era, smaller rivals like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure have grown at higher rates since the arrival of ChatGPT. Microsoft and Google have surged by tightly integrating with frontier AI models—the technology underlying ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively—attracting enterprises eager to experiment with cutting-edge capabilities.

This rise of AWS's rivals has raised questions about Amazon's broader AI strategy, and how the incumbent will fare in the years to come.

Garman says he's been hearing these concerns for years, but less so in recent months. He argues that the tide is turning, pointing to AWS's stronger-than-expected results in the company's third quarter as evidence that his strategy is working.

The counter argument to his approach comes from other AI leaders, who believe that AI is a more fundamental shift in computing and will force companies to completely rethink their approach to product development. In a world where AI is a true paradigm shift, cutting-edge AI capabilities may take precedence, and incumbents like AWS could be in a more precarious position.

AI seems to be driving major organizational changes inside of Amazon. In October, the company announced it would lay off 14,000 people as it invests more in AI. Those layoffs came just a few months after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon would need fewer people in certain areas because of AI.

Internally, Garman says that AI tools are significantly accelerating some engineering teams' work as employees shift from writing code themselves to directing a team of AI agents. He says one AWS team recently did a big rewrite of an internal codebase, expecting that it would take 30 people roughly 18 months to complete. With the use of AI, Garman claims the team was able to complete the task with just six people in 71 days.

Some Amazon employees have a less optimistic tone when it comes to the company's embrace of AI. In November, more than 1,000 anonymous Amazon employees signed a petition warning that the company's “aggressive” AI rollout could come at a cost to the environment.

Garman notes that the upside of AI agents are not unlimited—though his focus here is around agent management, not environmental impact.

“Agents are most effective when you ask them to do things that … you actually know how to do yourself,” he said. “So these are not replacements for people. They are ways to make people more effective at their jobs.”

Still, Amazon says the efficiency gains of AI are also making their way to Amazon customers. Reddit was given early access to Amazon's new Forge service, and was able to train an AI model on millions of content moderation decisions, according to AWS. Reddit said the AI model it made with Amazon developed a “social intuition,” and can now help with content moderation for millions of its online communities.

While Amazon is betting big on AI, Garman is skeptical of the exuberance sweeping the broader industry. This year, early stage labs like Mira Murati's Thinking Machines Lab and Ilya Sutskever's Safe Superintelligence nabbed multibillion-dollar investments, despite that they're not yet deploying widely used products.

“When people talk about a bubble, I think those are the deals that are most at risk,” said Garman, referring to AI startups that have raised billion dollar seed rounds. “Where it's a $3 billion valuation for a startup with no lines of code. Maybe, but maybe not. Those are the ones where I think there's open questions.”

But Garman insists that Amazon's AI investments are justified. The company brought on 3.8 gigawatts of new infrastructure capacity in the past 12 months, and just announced an up to $50 billion investment in AI data centers for the US government. Amazon says it's still able to sell off new capacity as soon as it comes online.

“I see the value that so many companies are getting out of AI today, and I don't see that there's any pullback,” said Garman. “They're getting real returns. They're delivering real value to their customers. And so for us, that is a good signal, and we're still in the early stages of what that value is going to be.”

As Silicon Valley continues to chase superintelligence and AGI, AWS seems to be taking a more grounded approach. Whether that's enough to remain king of the cloud providers remains to be seen.

Question for the audience:

With the launch of Gemini 3, I'm hearing a lot of folks in the AI industry say that AI progress hasn't stalled, despite what the skeptics might think. I'd love to hear from Model Behavior readers: What are you doing with AI today that wasn't possible 12 months ago? On the flip side, how is the technology the same (capability-wise) as it was last year? Respond in the comments below or email me—happy to keep things off record.

Editor's note: This series profiles six of the Seattle region's “Uncommon Thinkers”: inventors, scientists, technologists and entrepreneurs transforming industries and driving positive change in the world. They will be recognized Dec. 11 at the GeekWire Gala. Uncommon Thinkers is presented in partnership with Greater Seattle Partners.

Plenty of startup founders and product builders envision what they're making as something that will simplify processes or improve workflow for customers. Kiana Ehsani sees her creation as a means to spending more time outdoors.

Certainly there's much more to it than that, but when Ehsani — the co-founder and CEO of Seattle AI startup Vercept — is running an ultramarathon, climbing up a mountain or skiing down one, she can't help but consider how her technology makes it all the more enjoyable.

“I'm just the happiest when I'm in nature, when I'm not behind my computer, letting my mind be present in the moment, listening to the steps of my foot on the trail, or on snow or ice,” Ehsani said.

It's what motivated her and her colleagues at Vercept to build Vy, an AI product that “sees” and understands computer screens like a human would. It records a user performing tasks across different software or websites — and then autonomously runs the same workflow from a natural language command.

The idea is to use AI to automate repetitive tasks, like entering data, producing video content, organizing invoices, and more. And Ehsani said Vy makes it so not everyone needs to know how to work so many specialized software programs.

“I don't want to become skilled in every single dimension that exists out there,” she said. “The more time you're not spending on repetitive work that is not using your brain power, then the more time you have to be creative.”

Ehsani's goal is to be able to send emails or check code and Slack messages when she's somewhere in nature without good internet service. Vy handles the tasks on its own and reports back about what it completed.

“I am most creative when I'm on a hike,” she said. “If I could just have that more often, to be able to have that creative mind, flowing and producing more, and I didn't have to be stuck behind the desk, then the world would be my playground.”

Ehsani's journey to AI innovator and Seattle startup founder started in Iran, where she lived until she graduated from Sharif University. She ranked 64th in the country's University Entrance Exam.

“I was a geek,” she said. “I was publishing papers as an undergrad, and I would go and give talks at conferences internationally, and I was so proud of what I was doing.”

She came to the U.S. in 2015 to get her Master's and PhD in computer science at the University of Washington. 

“Within the first year I realized, ‘Oh, there's a lot of possibility in AI and I want to get more involved,'” Ehsani said.

After internships at Google and Meta, she joined Seattle's Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) where she spent four years, overseeing the Ai2 robotics and embodied artificial intelligence teams as a senior researcher.

At the end of 2024, Ehsani launched Vercept alongside Oren Etzioni, the longtime AI specialist and UW professor who was founding CEO of Ai2. They were joined by Matt Deitke, Luca Weihs, and Ross Girshick.

Etzioni said that while some people are “all heart” — good people with high emotional intelligence — or “all brain” — smart, sharp and cerebral — it's rare to find someone who is both. Ehsani, who he called brilliant, dedicated and intuitive, is that person.

“One uncommon thing about Kiana is how she has repeatedly transformed herself,” Etzioni said via email. “From a brilliant theoretician in Iran to a creative and award-winning vision and robotics researcher at UW and Ai2, to kick-ass founder and CEO now. And the best is yet to come!”

Ehsani remembers being frustrated and bored by the challenges that AI was being tasked to solve, such as simple image classification, just 10 years ago. She wanted to solve real problems and show that AI could interact with the real world.

That mindset drove her interest in computer vision and robotics research. But again, she grew frustrated by the slow pace of hardware development and decided she wanted to work with AI models and virtual robots that take actions on behalf of a user.

Growing up in Iran she had become accustomed to limited resources. Working in academia and then in research for a nonprofit, she again had to think outside the box and find ways to compete against big AI labs. 

She still embraces a scrappy startup mentality as Vercept competes against OpenAI (Operator), Google (Project Mariner), Amazon (Nova Act), and others with tools that automate tasks across browsers and apps, fueled by advances in generative AI.

“That's the mindset that made me grow more, and that's why at Vercept we are training models a lot more efficiently and less resource-heavy than anyone out there,” she said. “We love being scrappy and proving that you don't need billions and trillions of dollars to make AI work.”

Just this week, Vercept launched a newly built version of Vy that works on both Windows and MacOS. Ehsani said the app is more robust and Vercept's benchmark results have improved drastically.

The startup has grown to a team of 12 and in June raised a $16 million seed round. In July, Ehsani lost Deitke, one of her co-founders, who was lured by Meta to join its newly formed Superintelligence Lab.

Deitke called Ehsani “an incredible leader and visionary” whose strong background in robotics makes her extremely well suited for working at the frontier of computer use, which he said is really just robotics without many of the challenges of the physical world.

“Working with her is infectious and inspiring,” Deitke said. “She has an incredible work ethic and is constantly energized and comes up with amazing ideas while brainstorming that only become obvious to the rest of us after a while.”

But he said more than anything, Ehsani's a “tremendous person” who leaves a lasting mark with her kindness and ambition. 

“She's truly an exceptional person,” Deitke said.

Several weeks ago, Ehsani was challenging herself in nature yet again, this time with a 50k ultramarathon that featured 8,000 feet of elevation gain. 

Freezing, thirsty, and dragging herself up a hill, she likened the race to running a startup, writing on LinkedIn about how despite everything going wrong and plans changing last minute, she still had to stay flexible and believe she'd make it, even when others seemed ahead.

“That's the story of my life,” she told GeekWire. “I live that every day.”

French AI startup Mistral launched its new Mistral 3 family of open-weight models on Tuesday, a launch that aims to prove it can lead in making AI publicly available and serve business clients better than Big Tech rivals.The 10-model release includes a large frontier model with multimodal and multilingual capabilities and nine smaller offline-capable, fully customizable models. 

The launch comes as Mistral, which develops open-weight language models and Europe-focused AI chatbot Le Chat, has appeared to be playing catch up with some of Silicon Valley's closed-source frontier models. Open-weight models release their model weights publicly so anyone can download and run them. Meanwhile, closed-source models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, keep their weights proprietary and only provide access through APIs or controlled interfaces.

The two-year-old startup, founded by former DeepMind and Meta researchers, has raised about $2.7 billion to date at a $13.7 billion valuation — peanuts compared to the numbers that competitors like OpenAI ($57 billion raised at a $500 billion valuation) and Anthropic ($45 billion raised at a $350 billion valuation) are pulling.

But Mistral is trying to prove that bigger isn't always better — especially for enterprise use cases. 

“Our customers are sometimes happy to start with a very large [closed] model that they don't have to fine-tune … but when they deploy it, they realize it's expensive, it's slow,” Guillaume Lample, co-founder and chief scientist at Mistral, told TechCrunch. “Then they come to us to fine-tune small models to handle the use case [more efficiently].” 

“In practice, the huge majority of enterprise use cases are things that can be tackled by small models, especially if you fine-tune them,” Lample continued. 

Initial benchmark comparisons, which place Mistral's smaller models well behind its closed-source competitors, can be misleading, Lample said. Large closed-source models may perform better out-of-the-box, but the real gains happen when you customize. 

“In many cases, you can actually match or even out-perform closed-source models,” he said.

Mistral's large frontier model, dubbed Mistral Large 3, catches up to some of the important capabilities that larger closed-source AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4o and Google's Gemini 2 boast, while also trading blows with several open-weight competitors. Large 3 is among the first open frontier models with multimodal and multilingual capabilities all in one, putting it on par with Meta's Llama 3 and Alibaba's Qwen3-Omni. Many other companies currently pair impressive large language models with separate smaller multi-modal models, something Mistral has done previously with models like Pixtral and Mistral Small 3.1.

Large 3 also features a “granular Mixture of Experts” architecture with 41 billion active parameters and 675 billion total parameters, enabling efficient reasoning across a 256,000 context window. This design delivers both speed and capability, allowing it to process lengthy documents and function as an agentic assistant for complex enterprise tasks. Mistral positions Large 3 as suitable for document analysis, coding, content creation, AI assistants, and workflow automation.

With its new family of small models, dubbed Ministral 3, the company is making the bold claim that smaller models aren't just sufficient – they're superior. 

The lineup includes nine distinct, high-performance dense models across three sizes (14 billion, 8 billion, and 3 billion parameters) and three variants: Base (the pre-trained foundation model), Instruct (chat-optimized for conversation and assistant-style workflows), and Reasoning (optimized for complex logic and analytical tasks).

Mistral says this range gives developers and businesses the flexibility to match models to their exact performance, whether they're after raw performance, cost efficiency, or specialized capabilities. The company claims Ministral 3 scores on par or better than other open-weight leaders while being more efficient and generating fewer tokens for equivalent tasks. All variants support vision, handle 128,000-256,000 context windows, and work across languages.

A major part of the pitch is practicality. Lample emphasizes that Ministral 3 can run on a single GPU, making it deployable on affordable hardware — from on-premise servers to laptops, robots, and other edge devices that may have limited connectivity. That matters not only for enterprises keeping data in-house, but also for students seeking feedback offline or robotics teams operating in remote environments. Greater efficiency, Lample argues, translates directly to broader accessibility. 

“It's part of our mission to be sure that AI is accessible to everyone, especially people without internet access,” he said. “We don't want AI to be controlled by only a couple of big labs.”

Some other companies are pursuing similar efficiency trade-offs: Cohere's latest enterprise model, Command A, also runs on just two GPUs, and its AI agent platform North can run on just one GPU. 

That sort of accessibility is driving Mistral's growing physical AI focus. Earlier this year, the company began working to integrate its smaller models into robots, drones, and vehicles. Mistral is collaborating with Singapore's Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) on specialized models for robots, cybersecurity systems, and fire safety; with German defense tech startup Helsing on vision-language-action models for drones; and with automaker Stellantis on an in-car AI assistant.

For Mistral, reliability and independence are just as critical as performance.

“Using an API from our competitors that will go down for half an hour every two weeks — if you're a big company, you cannot afford this,” Lample said.

To build a prototype FEL-based EUV light source, apparently.

xLight, a U.S.-based startup developing an EUV light source based on a particle accelerator, on Tuesday signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with the U.S. Department of Commerce for $150 million in proposed federal incentives under the CHIPS and Science Act. xLight came out of the blue earlier this year when it hired Pat Gelsinger, former chief executive of Intel, as executive chairman. The money, if awarded, will be used to bring xLight's free-electron laser (FEL) based light source closer to reality once it is built in Albany and its viability is proven in practice.

"With the support from the [Department of] Commerce, our investors, and development partners, xLight is building its first free-electron laser system at the Albany Nanotech Complex, where the world's best lithography capabilities will enable the research and development that will define the future of chip manufacturing," said Nicholas Kelez, CEO and CTO of xLight.

The Trump administration has been particularly sceptical about Joe Biden's CHIPS and Science Act, claiming that it is a waste of taxpayers' money. However, it looks like the U.S. government has changed its mind with xLight, which promises to develop a new FEL-based light source for EUV lithography tools that would replace traditional laser-produced plasma (LPP) sources based on CO2 lasers. If xLight succeeds in building its technology and wedding it to ASML's lithography scanners, then the U.S. will control an important part of the global supply chain for these tools, which is perhaps something that got the current American leadership.

"Building an energy-efficient EUV laser with tenfold improvements over today's technology will drive the next era of Moore's Law, accelerating fab productivity, while developing a critical domestic capability," said Pat Gelsinger, Executive Chairman of the Board, xLight, and General Partner, Playground Global.

Note that in deals like the one announced between xLight and the U.S. DoC, an LOI is a non-binding agreement in principle: it signals that both sides intend to move forward, but it does not obligate the government to release funds or the company to receive them, though it means that the government has finished a preliminary evaluation and selected the company for potential funding. xLight will now work with the U.S. DoC and teams at the Albany Nanotech Complex, so expect further disclosures in the coming months. In parallel, the company will continue its joint development work across the Department of Energy lab network.

xLight is developing a FEL-based light source that can be used to deliver coherent EUV radiation directly to existing ASML wafer scanners. The approach is significantly different from LPP-based light sources that ASML (well, its U.S.-based Cymer unit) once developed for its current litho tools.

xLight gets powerful FEL by first using a particle accelerator, which speeds up electrons to very high velocities with radiofrequency (RF) and magnetic fields; these fast particles are then fed into an FEL, where the electrons from the accelerator pass through undulators that create a periodic magnetic field and, as a result, generate coherent, high-intensity light beams featuring required wavelengths (13.5nm in case of EUV, though scalable to 2nm for soft X-ray). The FEL is housed in a separate facility adjacent to the fab (i.e., not inside the cleanroom). Once EUV light is generated, it is piped via a network of specialized grazing-incidence mirrors with turning stations to multiple ASML scanners, up to 20 per FEL unit. This light then enters the scanner's illuminator, where it is shaped and directed onto the wafer.

As there is no plasma conversion step, xLight claims that its device enables higher brightness, narrower spectral width, and femtosecond pulses for sharper patterning. However, the company has yet to prove two critical things: that its technology works in general and is viable for mass production of semiconductors. The latter will arguably be harder than the former, as xLight will have to find a company with multiple Low-NA (or better High-NA) EUV tools that is willing to conduct experiments with scanners that cost around $200 million (nearly $400 million for High-NA EUV) a unit.

Furthermore, since xLight uses a DOE lab network, at least some of the elements of its technology may be classified, meaning that the company will have trouble exporting them to other countries in any form. On the one hand, this might give America an edge when it comes to lithography, but on the other hand, this might also slow down adoption of the technology.

Early approvals cover major suppliers after a year of tighter controls.

China has issued the first round of streamlined rare-earth export licences to at least three permanent-magnet manufacturers, allowing them to accelerate shipments to selected overseas clients after months of stricter controls.

Reuters reports that JL Mag Rare Earth, Ningbo Yunsheng, and Beijing Zhong Ke San Huan High-Tech received approvals tied to individual customers on December 2. Beijing began designing the new system following the October 30 meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, which aimed to ease trade tensions after a year marked by successive layers of export restrictions.

The approvals represent the first use of what China is calling “general licences”, a shift from the case-by-case permissions that slowed exports throughout 2025. These licences run for a year and attach to specific downstream clients rather than entire product lines. JL Mag, one of the world's largest sintered-magnet producers, can reportedly ship to nearly all of its customers. Ningbo Yunsheng and Zhong Ke San Huan, meanwhile, obtained narrower permissions covering part of their client lists. China's Ministry of Commerce and the companies involved did not respond to requests for comment, according to Reuters.

The development comes after Beijing tightened its oversight over both rare-earth materials and finished magnet products in recent months. Those measures heightened scrutiny of technologies used in magnet fabrication and expanded categories requiring explicit approval. It also increased lead times as licensing evaluations grew more complex. The introduction of a standing, customer-specific licence is intended to shorten those timelines without dismantling the broader control structure that has built up around the sector.

Permanent magnets remain one of the most internationally exposed segments of China's rare-earth industry. The country dominates global production, particularly in high-performance parts used in things like motors and generators. Year-to-date export data released in October showed that Chinese exports of rare-earth magnets totaled 45,290 tons, a 5.2% decline compared to the previous year.

What happens next depends on how many customers are added to the approved lists over the coming months. Because the licences are assigned to specific buyers, relief will arrive unevenly both across sectors and within them. Some larger manufacturers may see faster turnaround immediately, while others remain subject to slower reviews.

It's also important to remember that while licenses are being granted, the underlying export-control framework remains intact. The first approvals provide a new track through it rather than an exemption from it, and any wider easing will become visible only as additional firms are granted licenses.

JPR says Nvidia's GPU market share decreased by 1.2% in Q3'25. It still owns over 90% of the market, though.

The latest quarterly GPU market share figures have been released by specialist analyst outfit Jon Peddie Research (JPR). It observes that, during Q3 2025, the PC add-in-board (graphics card) market grew to 12.0 million units, which is 2.8% up vs the previous quarter. However, probably more interesting are the figures showing that AMD and Intel are gaining market share – at the expense of Nvidia, of course (as it is a three-horse race).

Make no mistake, Nvidia's market share still looks almost unassailable at 92% in Q3'25. It remains dominant and still makes some of the best graphics cards for gaming in 2025. But its position has slipped from 94% in the previous quarter.

Those are rounded figures, as the JPR news post says that Nvidia's market share has decreased just 1.2% from the last to the current quarter. Nevertheless, more than nine out of 10 graphics cards sold are still Nvidia GPU-based, according to JPR's figures.

Q3'25 still showed an uplift in graphics cards sold, but the increase was less than usual for the season. JPR says that the 2.8% increase recorded “was less than the historical 10-year average of 11.4% for this quarter.”

More importantly, the analysts think this can be explained by a wave of “panic buying because of the pending tariff,” occurring in Q2. Naturally, U.S.-based buyers shifted their AIB buying decisions forward due to looming tariffs creating retail pricing uncertainty.

The shifting sands of the AIB market share have precipitated a milestone for Intel. While it is a Goliath of the PC CPU world, its AIB products are still minnows. At least now, it can hold its head high with a full 1% market share of the dGPU business.

AMD is also shown to be on the up. Its RDNA 4-based Radeon RX 9000 series offerings, like the RX 9070 XT, appear to be popular in the media and at retail. This popularity manifests as a 7% market share, up by 0.8% from Q2'25.

Another figure that was intriguing to see highlighted was the AIB penetration rate in desktop PCs. The Q3'25 figure of 162% indicates that there's quite a lot of GPU upgrading going on, with system upgrades outpacing new builds. You will see this percentage is resolutely above 100% as PC systems usually get a GPU upgrade, or two, during their service life. But 162% is pretty high.

Lastly, it is worth a look at the analyst company's crystal ball gazing regarding the graphics card market. Dr. Jon Peddie, president of JPR, openly worries about “an inflation-driven recession due to the socioeconomic turmoil created by the Trump administration.”

This concern may be the driving force behind the research outfit's predicted 2024-to-2029 AIB growth rate being restricted to negative territory (-0.7% CAGR).

Hackers poking around in iOS 26 recently uncovered something Apple definitely didn't intend anyone to see: every modern iPhone is running the operating system Apple's upcoming “iPhone Fold” will likely use. Which means these phones are—right now—already capable of running a full, fluid desktop experience.

From a performance standpoint, that shouldn't be surprising. At Apple's September 2025 event, the company claimed the A19 Pro chip inside the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro offers “MacBook Pro levels of compute.” And that iPhone chip is reportedly destined to power a cheaper MacBook in 2026. The line between Apple's hardware is being further blurred, then—but what's wild is that the software side of things has blurred completely too. It's just that nobody realized.

For years, Apple has insisted that iOS and iPadOS are distinct, despite sharing code and habitually borrowing each other's features. But a self-proclaimed “tech geek” on Reddit who got iPad features running on an iPhone claimed they're not merely similar—they're essentially the same: “Turns out iOS has all the iPadOS code (and vice versa; you can for instance enable Dynamic Island on iPad).”

TechExpert2910 revealed on Reddit that his hacked iPhone ran iPad OS “incredibly well,” making his 17 Pro Max an “insane pocket computer” with more RAM than his M4 iPad Pro.

The hack relies on an exploit that tricks the iPhone's operating system into thinking it's running on an iPad. That unlocks smallish tweaks such as a landscape Home Screen, an iPad-style app switcher, and more Dock items. But it also provides transformative changes such as running desktop-grade apps that aren't available for iPhone, full windowed multitasking, and optimal external display support. All without Apple Silicon breaking a sweat.

The exploit is already patched in the iOS 26.2 beta, and the Redditor accused Apple of locking out iPhone users and artificially limiting older devices to push upgrades. But are things really that simple?

It's not like the “phone as PC” dream is new. Android's been chasing it since DeX debuted in 2017. Barely anyone cares. So why should Apple? Perhaps the concept is a niche nerd fantasy. And there's the longtime argument that if you want to do “proper” work, you need a “proper” computer. If even an iPad can't replace a computer, how can an iPhone?

In June, after 15 years, the iPad got key software features, including resizable and movable windows.

Except, as WIRED demonstrated, an iPad can replace a computer for plenty of people—you just need the right accessories. It therefore follows the same is true for an iPhone running the exact same software. But where will any momentum for this future come from?

Android 16 is technically ready for another crack at desktop mode, with a new system that builds on DeX. But even now, having finally escaped beta, it's buried in developer settings. That might be down to the grim state of big-screen Android apps, or the desktop experience itself feeling, politely, “rocky.”

Paradoxically, Apple appears to be further ahead despite never announcing any of this. It already has a deep ecosystem of desktop-grade iPad apps. And the iPad features running on iPhone already look polished. Sure, some interface quirks remain, and you might need to file your fingers to a point to hit window controls. But the performance is fast, fluid, and snappy. So if the experience is this good, why is Apple so determined to hide it?

One argument is practical. Apple likes each device to be its own thing, optimized for a specific form factor. It's keen to finesse the transition between platforms rather than have one device to rule them all. A phone lacks a big screen and a physical keyboard. Plugging those things in on a train isn't as elegant as opening a MacBook or using an iPad connected to a Magic Keyboard. However, with imagination, you can see the outlines of a new ecosystem of profitable accessories for a more capable iPhone.

Could the bottom of your iPhone screen look more like this in the future? Apple's current phone software certainly makes it possible.

But Apple hasn't got where it has by selling accessories nor by making a market for others to do so. Most of its profits come from a long-running strategy to nudge people into buying more hardware that coexists. It doesn't want you to choose between an iPhone, an iPad, a MacBook Air, and an iMac. It wants you to buy all of them.

But if an iPhone can do iPad things, maybe someone won't buy an iPad. If iPads act too much like Macs, people might not buy as many Macs. Strategically chosen—if sometimes artificial—limits and product segmentation have pride of place in Cupertino's rulebook. A convergence model could knock user experience and simplicity; but Apple would likely be more fearful of how it could negatively impact sales.

That all said, perhaps there is another explanation: Apple is saving this for an inflection point—the iPhone Fold. Rumors suggest that Apple has solved the “screen crease” problem and will in 2026 ship a foldable with a 7.8-inch, 4:3 display that's similar to (but sharper than) the iPad mini's.

A tablet-sized display that doesn't let you multitask like on an iPad would be absurd, especially on a device likely to cost two or three times more than an actual iPad mini. Doubly so if Apple puts last year's iPhone chip into a MacBook that will have a full desktop environment and support at least one external display.

And for anyone fretting about being forced into a more desktop-style iPhone, Apple already solved that problem. It killed the Steve Jobs vision of the iPad that sat between two computing extremes by letting users switch modes. The iPhone could follow suit, defaulting to its original purist mode while allowing power users to tap into windowing and external device support.

These hacks, then, have given us a window into the iPhone Fold operating system and other aspects of a possible Apple future. They show that iPad features on iPhone already look slick and make complete sense. And the crazy thing is they're in your iPhone's software right now. Next year, they'll almost certainly be unleashed on the most expensive iPhone Apple has ever made. The question is whether Apple will let regular iPhone users have them, too.

We knew a Helldivers movie was in the works—and that the game's developers were (jokingly, sorta) hoping to attract A-list actors to meet grisly fates as part of the story's space marines-fighting-aliens action. Well, now there's an A-list director attached who could help make those dreams come true, and his hiring lets us know just how serious Sony and PlayStation are about their Starship Troopers heir apparent: it's Justin Lin, who made five (almost six) Fast & Furious movies.

High-stakes action? Lin can handle that. Stylish violence? Check. Outer-space stuff? Indeed, he also directed Star Trek Beyond. And if you want a director able to wrangle ensemble casts made up of big-name talent, Lin has quite a bit of experience doing that just from those two franchises.

Lin's most recent film, this year's independent drama Last Days, was a departure from his Hollywood trajectory, so Helldivers signals he's moving back into the big-budget action-movie realm.

The news of Lin joining Helldivers was reported first by the Hollywood Reporter, which noted he'll also produce. The script is by Gary Dauberman, a horror veteran (Annabelle, The Nun, It Chapter Two) who also penned this year's horror video game adaptation Until Dawn.

According to THR, “Lin is not a gamer and leaned into that as a strength when pitching his take on the material, said insiders. He aims to find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story while building out a world and mythology. There are plenty of details waiting to be drawn in, something that is compelling to the filmmaker.”

The trade also points out that Lin remains attached to the One-Punch Man manga adaptation, as well as the Keanu Reeves comic adaptation Brzrkr. There's no word yet on what order the busy filmmaker will make these projects, or when Helldiver might be expected in theaters.

— Smartsheet's C-suite shuffle continues with the hiring of Scott Torrey as chief revenue officer. 

Torrey previously led salary data company Payscale as CEO from 2019 to 2021. He spent the past three years as executive chairman at finance software startup Tesorio, and was at Concur for nearly two decades, including six years as chief revenue officer. 

His new role marks a reunion of sorts as he teams up again with Concur co-founder Rajeev Singh, who recently became CEO at Smartsheet. 

“Smartsheet is on a growth trajectory, and Scott's leadership will drive our go-to-market success,” Singh said in a press release. 

Smartsheet earlier this year hired Pratima Arora as its chief product officer and Ravi Soin as chief information security officer. It also named Cynthia Tee as chief technology officer.

Founded two decades ago, Smartsheet is one of the Seattle region's iconic tech companies, with a large customer base of major businesses and more than $1 billion in annual revenue. It went private earlier this year in a $8.4 billion deal with Vista Equity Partners and Blackstone.

Speaking to the company's annual Engage conference in Seattle last month, Singh said it's time for Smartsheet to “step out of the shadows” and challenge old perceptions of Smartsheet as simply an online spreadsheet tool. The company recently announced new features as part of its “Intelligent Work Management” platform that combines AI agents, knowledge graphs, and automation. 

— Amar Subramanya, a top AI researcher who joined Microsoft in July as a corporate VP, is changing jobs again and joining Apple as vice president of AI.

Subramanya will report to Craig Federighi, Apple's vice president of software engineering, the tech giant announced Monday. He'll lead Apple Foundation Models, ML research, and AI Safety and Evaluation.

Apple also announced that John Giannandrea, Apple's senior vice president for Machine Learning and AI Strategy, is stepping down. 

Before joining Microsoft, Subramanya was at Google for more than 16 years, where he helped lead work on Gemini. He earned his Ph.D. at the University of Washington in 2009 and was a visiting researcher at Microsoft for a year in the mid-2000s.

“AI has long been central to Apple's strategy, and we are pleased to welcome Amar to Craig's leadership team and to bring his extraordinary AI expertise to Apple,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a press release. 

Apple has struggled to catch up with competitors in the AI race and recently delayed a new version of its Siri voice assistant.

— Torben Severson left Amazon after 17 years to take a new role as vice president and head of global business development at OpenAI. Severson held multiple business development leadership roles, most recently as chief of staff to Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores.

“Joining OpenAI at such a defining moment in technology is an opportunity I couldn't pass up,” Severson said in a LinkedIn post. “I'm drawn to moments of transformation — and it's rare to be part of something so squarely at the frontier of what's possible.”

Severson said he was the first person to join “what became Corporate Business Development” at Amazon in 2008. “I'm deeply grateful for the people I've learned from and worked alongside,” he wrote. “Amazon shaped how I think, taught me how to navigate complex problems, and gave me the opportunity to build and lead exceptional teams. Through those experiences I learned the value of high judgment, clarity in ambiguity, and building trust through curiosity and rigor.”

OpenAI, based in San Francisco, said last year that it opened an office in Bellevue, Wash. The company recently acquired Bellevue-based startup Statsig.

Nuclear power company TerraPower has passed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff's final safety evaluation for a permit to build a reactor in Wyoming. The Washington-based company backed by Bill Gates and NVIDIA could be the first to deploy a utility-scale, next-generation reactor in America.

TerraPower's Natrium design pairs a small modular reactor (SMR) with an integrated thermal battery. The SMR generates 345 megawatts of continuous electrical power. The thermal battery, which stores excess heat in molten salt, allows the system to surge its output to 500 megawatts for more than five hours, generating enough energy to power 400,000 homes at maximum capacity.

“Today is a momentous occasion for TerraPower, our project partners and the Natrium design,” said company CEO Chris Levesque in a statement issued Monday. The favorable assessment “reflects years of rigorous evaluation, thoughtful collaboration with the NRC, and an unwavering commitment to both safety and innovation.”

The company launched in 2006 and is building on technology used in an experimental breeder reactor in Idaho that operated for nearly 30 years before shutting down. 

TerraPower set a goal of producing power at the Kemmerer, Wyo., site by 2030. The reactor is located near a retiring coal plant. 

There is tremendous renewed interest in nuclear as tech giants and data center operators scramble for new energy sources to power AI operations. Microsoft, Amazon and others have invested in a combination of existing nuclear plants that can be restarted and construction of new facilities. The Trump administration has pledged to expedite permitting.  

“We've finished our technical work on the Kemmerer review a month ahead of our already accelerated schedule, as we aim to make licensing decisions for new, advanced reactors in no more than 18 months,” said Jeremy Groom, acting director of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. 

“We thank TerraPower for promptly addressing the agency's questions to ensure safety and enable the NRC to efficiently process the application,” he added in a statement. 

The NRC said there are no safety aspects that would preclude issuing a construction permit for the reactor. TerraPower last year broke ground in Wyoming on non-nuclear components of the facility. 

In June the company announced $650 million in new funding from Gates, who helped start TerraPower, as well as the venture arm of chip giant NVIDIA. It previously raised more than $1 billion, including investments from Gates as well as South Korea-based SK Inc. and SK Innovation, according to PitchBook. TerraPower has additionally been awarded roughly $2 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy.

There are still additional permitting hurdles to complete:

During the Middle to Upper Miocene period (12.4 to 5.3 million years ago), giant animals walked—and slithered—the Earth thanks to warmer temperatures, larger wetlands, and greater amounts of food. Many of their descendants today are significantly smaller, but anacondas (Eunectes) have proven to be unexpectedly stubborn.

Researchers investigated 12.4-million-year-old fossils from Venezuela to understand how large ancient anacondas were compared to their relatives today. They found that these early serpents would have been 13 to 16 feet (4 to 5 meters) long on average. That aligns with the usual size of today's anacondas, meaning these tropical reptiles have remained humongous for millions of years.

Unlike other giant species, which reached their peak size during the Miocene before dying out and getting replaced by smaller species in the Pliocene, “large Eunectes has persisted in tropical South America to the present,” the researchers wrote in their study, published today in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

Specifically, the team measured 183 fossilized backbones from at least 32 anacondas. Anacondas can have over 300 vertebrae, but the size of just one allows researchers to reliably reconstruct how long the snake was. This analysis, along with fossil data from elsewhere in South America, revealed that anacondas reached their maximum size 12.4 million years ago. They continued being huge, even when many other giant species went extinct.

“Other species like giant crocodiles and giant turtles have gone extinct since the Miocene, probably due to cooling global temperatures and shrinking habitats, but the giant anacondas have survived—they are super-resilient,” Andrés Alfonso-Rojas, lead author of the study and a PhD student in the Department of Zoology at the University of Cambridge, said in a statement by the University of Cambridge. “By measuring the fossils we found that anacondas evolved a large body size shortly after they appeared in tropical South America around 12.4 million years ago, and their size hasn't changed since.”

Alfonso-Rojas and his colleagues also used an approach called the ancestral state reconstruction, which consisted of reconstructing the length of giant anacondas and related species of extant snakes with a snake family tree. This method confirmed that when anacondas first emerged during the Miocene, they would have been on average 13 to 16 feet (4 to 5 meters) long.

“This is a surprising result because we expected to find the ancient anacondas were seven or eight metres long,” Alfonso-Rojas explained. That's about 23 to 26 feet long. “But we don't have any evidence of a larger snake from the Miocene when global temperatures were warmer.” Snakes are especially sensitive to temperature, so researchers thought snakes would have been larger back then.

Anacondas are some of the world's largest snakes and thrive in swamps, marshes, and big rivers like the Amazon. They had it great during the Miocene, when all of northern South America would have been similar to the current Amazonian region. Today there are significantly fewer anacondas than back then, but they still have enough habitats and food to sustain their gigantism.

Good thing other species didn't stick around at their original size. Could you imagine if we still had megalodons swimming around?

A new study analyzing dozens of published papers over five decades focusing on health care disparities in Washington, DC, found that those that employed medical humanities approaches identified crucial barriers and opportunities for intervention that quantitative studies often miss.

Lead author Sweta Ghatti, a fourth year student at Georgetown School of Medicine, began the study as part of a Mitchell Summer Research Scholarship project addressing health challenges in the District. Ghatti worked closely with senior author Lakshmi Krishnan, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine and director of the Georgetown Medical Humanities, on the project for almost two years.

Their findings are described in the article, "Mapping DC Inequities: A Scoping Review Comparing Scientific and Medical Humanities Approaches" and was published Dec. 2 in the journal Humanities and Social Sciences Communications.

"We know that people living in the District face multiple challenges in accessing health care and that some segments of the population have significantly poorer health profiles," Ghatti said. "For example, predominantly Black areas of the District experience higher rates of chronic diseases such as asthma, hypertension, diabetes and poor maternal health outcomes than White neighborhoods. Our goal was to systematically map the literature of health disparity in DC and to examine the strengths and weaknesses of these methodologies in understanding barriers to care and potentially opportunities for intervention."

Medical humanities is a dynamic, interdisciplinary field that explores the ethical, historical, literary, philosophical and religious dimensions of health and illness. Medical humanities includes history of medicine, narrative medicine and other storytelling approaches, social sciences, communications and the use of the arts to identify issues that are important to patients, caregivers and providers.

In our efforts to advance health equity and improve population health, this human-centered approach should be normalized in health professions education."

Christopher J. King, PhD, FACHE, co-author and Dean of the School of Health

Ghatti began by analyzing over 1500 papers, using strict criteria to narrow down the final 119 included for analysis. Studies needed to be localized to the DC area and address specific health conditions and issues. Of those, 51 were tagged as medical humanities papers. The analysis revealed that the medical humanities papers were significantly more likely to identify systemic information gaps (78.4% vs. 30.9% p<0.001) and stigma-related barriers (27.5% vs. 5.p% p=0.002) compared to more quantitative scientific papers.

"Medicine and health care don't begin and end at the hospital or clinic doors. Medical humanities really bring a contextual approach to understanding how individuals and communities experience health care. "In these studies, we are looking at both specific factors and the enduring things that connect us," said Krishnan, who is also co-executive director of the Georgetown Howard Center for Medical Humanities and Health Justice. "We see these qualitative and quantitative studies as complementary, providing different lenses and more texture without breaking the health care experience into components."

"We find that quantitative studies don't provide a complete picture of disparities," says Ghatti. "In the medical humanities studies, we hear about issues like language barriers, stigma, mistrust of the health care system and lack of communication that makes navigating the health care system difficult for some patients."

Ghatti says the findings can have a direct impact on medical and public health education, medical practice and research.

"We need research that captures both measurable obstacles and those that resist quantification," she adds. "In this country, where health care disparities have persisted over the five decades we studied, the stakes are too high to rely on a single lens or intervention."

The authors report having no personal financial interests related to the study.

In addition to Ghatti, Krishnan and King, authors include Scott Dorris and Xue Geng, both of Georgetown University Medical Center.

 In this interview, News Medical speaks with Rhea Stringer, Electron Microscopist at the John Innes Centre, about the role of electron microscopy in biological imaging. Rhea discusses how advanced sample preparation technologies and a growing demand for volume electron microscopy are shaping new possibilities in plant and microbial research.

My name is Rhea Stringer, and I work at the John Innes Centre in Norwich. I'm part of the bioimaging platform specializing in electron microscopy. We offer imaging services for internal researchers and external collaborators, working with various plant and microbial samples. My background is in volume electron microscopy, which I helped establish here through an Institutional Development Grant. That's still my focus, but my role has expanded over time to cover a broad range of EM techniques.

Our lab supports various research projects, primarily in plant and microbial science. We focus on providing high-quality imaging using light and electron microscopy, depending on the researchers' needs. My work often involves preparing samples and optimizing imaging workflows - particularly for volume electron microscopy, which is increasingly in demand. It's a niche area, particularly within plant science, so it's exciting to be at the forefront of that development.

I'd say the biggest challenge, which I actually find quite exciting, is dealing with new or unfamiliar sample types. Sometimes researchers come to us with a question or a biological structure we haven't imaged before, and that means we need to develop new protocols. It can be challenging, but I enjoy the problem-solving aspect. It keeps things interesting and pushes us to keep learning and improving.

We use a lot of Leica equipment for sample preparation in electron microscopy. For instance, we have the EM tissue processor, which is automated and great for consistent results. The EM CPD300 for critical point drying samples.  Alternatively, for cryo-fixation, we have the EM ICE and the EM AFS2 for progressive low-temperature embedding or freeze-substitution. We also use the EM ACE600, which has a sputter coater and e-beam. For glow discharging and carbon coating, we use the EM ACE200. We also have the EM KMR3 Glass Knife Maker, and for sectioning and array tomography, we have the UC7 and ARTOS 3D ultramicrotomes. The whole Leica system helps streamline our workflow and makes everything smoother and more efficient.

Our most impactful capability for plant research lies in the integrated use of the EM ICE and the EM AFS2 system. Plant cells are notoriously difficult to prepare conventionally, as chemical fixatives often struggle to penetrate the thick cell walls, and large vacuoles can swell and rupture upon dehydration, leading to severe structural artifacts. The EM ICE resolves this by cryo-immobilizing the sample under high pressure within milliseconds, effectively trapping the cell in a near-native state without the need for chemical permeabilization. This method reliably preserves critical, transient structures.

Following freezing, the EM AFS2 allows for gentle, automated processing to replace the vitreous water with embedding resin at extremely low temperatures. This integrated, artifact-free approach is essential for obtaining quality data on plant development, cell signalling, and biotic/abiotic stress responses.

Honestly, it's been a really positive experience. The equipment is reliable, easy to use, and fits well into our workflows. But what really stood out was the support we've received from Leica. The engineers are approachable, knowledgeable, and genuinely helpful. They've provided excellent hands-on training, which makes a huge difference when adopting new techniques or troubleshooting issues.

I'd say just go for it - and if you're unsure about anything, ask questions. Everyone I've dealt with at Leica has been friendly, honest, and helpful. They don't push you to buy something that's not right for your lab. Instead, they really focus on finding the best solution for your needs, and that kind of support is invaluable.

Volume electron microscopy is still evolving, especially in plant science, my main area. It's exciting because there's so much to explore - new samples, organisms, and datasets. Even in just the three years I've been doing this work, the field has progressed rapidly. I'm looking forward to developing new techniques and seeing where it all goes.

Rhea Stringer is an Electron Microscopist at the John Innes Centre, one of the UK's leading plant and microbial science research institutes. She plays a key role in the Centre's bioimaging platform, supporting both internal and external researchers in their use of electron microscopy. Rhea's focus lies in volume electron microscopy - a field that continues to evolve and expand, particularly within plant science. Her work involves advanced sample preparation, imaging workflows, and technique development using state-of-the-art Leica instrumentation.

Rhea earned her undergraduate degree in Animal Sciences from Canterbury Christ Church University. Following her studies, she began her career as an animal technician and later became involved in using an ultramicrotome for sectioning wax-embedded brains for imaging. Her hands-on skills in sample handling, combined with a steady technique and a drive for continuous learning, led her to a role at the John Innes Centre. Through her work in microscopy services, Rhea contributes to a broad range of scientific studies that rely on high-resolution imaging to uncover the cellular architecture of plant and microbial samples. She is passionate about training others, refining EM protocols, and pushing the limits of what can be visualized through electron microscopy.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disease characterized by fibrosis and bile duct stricturing, which ultimately leads to cirrhosis and liver failure. PSC is strongly associated with both types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), namely, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

However, the patient population in Asia is relatively small, and no large-scale studies have previously examined the prevalence and clinical course of PSC in this region. To address this gap, the research team conducted a multinational collaborative study across six Asian countries.

In this study, 25 institutions from Japan, Korea, China (including Hong Kong), Taiwan, Malaysia, and India analyzed data from approximately 51,000 patients with IBD. The analysis revealed that the prevalence of PSC among patients with IBD in Asian centers is markedly lower than in Western countries, with a tendency toward more favorable clinical outcomes.

Furthermore, patients presenting with symptoms such as jaundice or hypoalbuminemia-indicative of impaired liver function-at the time of PSC diagnosis required liver transplantation sooner. However, the proportion of "asymptomatic PSC" at diagnosis has increased in recent years. These patients demonstrated preserved liver function, remaining stable for a prolonged time without needing a liver transplantation. This trend may be attributable to the widespread use of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, a noninvasive imaging modality that enables early-stage detection of PSC.

This study is the first systematic effort in identifying PSC cases among patients with IBD in Asia. The findings are expected to guide the development of clinical practice guidelines tailored to the unique characteristics and healthcare systems of Asian countries.

16S metagenomic sequencing enables targeted exploration of microbial communities by combining amplification of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, a reliable phylogenetic marker, with next generation sequencing (NGS) technology.

INTEGRA Biosciences has created an application guide that ensures precise amplicon sequencing, allowing the study of a wide variety of microbial communities.

Custom primers are used to amplify variable regions three and four (V3 and V4) of the 16S rRNA gene, which are then combined with Illumina sequencing adapters and dual indices for multiplexing.

This method, which uses paired-end 300 bp reads, produces high-quality data for taxonomic classification at the genus and species level.

INTEGRA provides ASSIST PLUS programs for each of these processes, which can be further optimized for your workflows, enabling straightforward, automated 16S metagenomic sequencing library creation.

Extending the viable shipping period provides a significant logistical advantage for Labskin, reducing risk associated with customs delays and enabling reliable distribution to customers and further expansion across key global markets.

Atelerix's patented hydrogel technology preserves membrane integrity and biological function at ambient or controlled temperatures, delivering a ready-to-use product upon arrival and avoiding the complications and resource demands of cold-chain transport. The MoU with Labskin follows in a series of strategic partnerships as the Company broadens global access to its preservation solutions across Europe, Africa, Asia and North America. Together, both companies will continue the collaborative optimization of workflows and pursue joint opportunities for external engagement to demonstrate how next-generation preservation can transform the shipping and handling of complex biological materials.

Atelerix and Labskin will co-host a webinar on December 4th, 10 am EST to share performance data and demonstrate the benefits of cryo-free preservation for complex 3D tissue models - enabling more reliable, sustainable, and efficient routes to market.

Labskin's pioneering human skin models are already driving innovation across dermatology, microbiome research, cosmetics and therapeutic development. We are delighted that our preservation technology can help them reliably reach customers anywhere in the world. This MoU marks the start of a deeper collaboration, and we look forward to jointly showcasing the exciting potential of cryo-free logistics for complex tissue systems."

Alastair Carrington, CEO, Atelerix

Nicola Kingswell, Scientific Director, Labskin, added: "The increased delivery window provided by Atelerix's technology has provided Labskin with the ability to ship our human 3D skin equivalents globally, without compromising on quality. It is a brilliant alternative to expensive controlled temperature shipping. The Atelerix team are a delight to collaborate with; friendly, responsive and knowledgeable, and I look forward to working closely with them for all our models as our partnership grows."

Victims of intimate partner violence with suicidal behavior have characteristic injury patterns on medical imaging, according to a new study being presented today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). The findings open the door to improved screening and earlier intervention to better protect these vulnerable populations, the researchers said.

Intimate partner violence is the physical, emotional or sexual abuse of a person by their partner or spouse. It is an increasingly recognized risk factor for suicidal behavior, and victims of intimate partner violence with suicidal behavior often end up at the hospital years before those without.

Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) in Boston studied this relationship in 1,451 women who had reported intimate partner violence to the hospital from 2013 to 2018.

Patients reporting intimate partner violence are at significantly increased risk of suicidal behavior. As suicide remains a leading cause of death worldwide, our evidence of distinct and overlapping injury patterns with intimate partner violence is an important step towards improving detection and providing timely intervention."

Emily Y. Yang, B.S., study co-author, 4th-year medical student at Harvard Medical School, Boston and research trainee at the Trauma Imaging Research and Innovation Center (TIRIC), BWH

Using medical classification codes relevant to suicidal behavior, which were defined as suicide attempt, self-harm and/or suicidal ideation, four study groups were formed: intimate partner violence with suicidal behavior, intimate partner violence without suicidal behavior, suicidal behavior without intimate partner violence, and patients who presented without intimate partner violence or suicidal behavior. The researchers also collected information on the timing and location of when the patient presented, such as day versus night and whether they came to the emergency room (ER) versus non-ER.

Suicidal behavior occurred at a higher frequency among patients reporting intimate partner violence (16.7%) versus patients without a history of intimate partner violence (2.5%). In the study, the majority of patients presented with suicidal behavior after reporting intimate partner violence. Patients with suicidal behavior and history of intimate partner violence were more likely than other patients to present to the hospital during the night versus day and in the ER, versus non-ER settings.

Review of reports by two experienced emergency radiologists revealed that both intimate partner violence and suicidal behavior played independent roles in doubling the overall injury rate compared to that of patients without a history of intimate partner violence or suicidal behavior. Patients with intimate partner violence often sustained head, face, neck and upper limb injuries-areas commonly hurt during assaults.

Intimate partner violence patients with suicidal behavior suffered over six times as many head/face/neck injuries, almost four times as many spinal fractures, three times as many deep injuries, and twice as many upper extremity injuries. These patients experienced almost twice as many severe injuries and three times as many mild injuries.

When looking at independent effects of intimate partner violence versus suicidal behavior, the researchers found that suicidal behavior had a greater impact on the injury rate of upper extremity injuries, while intimate partner violence had a greater impact on head/face/neck injuries. 

Increased awareness of the interaction between intimate partner violence, suicidal behavior and radiologic injury patterns can better protect these vulnerable populations, according to Yang.

"Patients with a history of intimate partner violence tend to hide their circumstances out of fear, stigma, and/or distrust in the medical system," she said. "Radiologists are possibly the only providers in a patient's healthcare experience who can identify subtle injuries and patterns that may otherwise go unnoticed, giving voice to an often-voiceless population."

Radiologists have a unique opportunity to uncover the hidden concerns behind injuries, according to MGH/BWH radiologist Bharti Khurana, M.D., M.B.A., associate professor at Harvard Medical School, founding director of TIRIC and principal investigator and senior author of the study.

"By recognizing recurring imaging patterns in patients experiencing intimate partner violence, especially those exhibiting suicidal behavior, we can initiate critical interventions earlier and potentially save lives," Dr. Khurana said.

Other co-authors are Alexander Kwon, Krishna Patel, Tatiana C Rocha, M.D., Maria A. Duran-Mendicuti, M.D., and Bernard Rosner, Ph.D.

The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering and the Office of the Director at the National Institutes of Health provided funding support for the research.

 December 02, 2025  

The recent decision by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to cover renal denervation for uncontrolled hypertension could help expand access to and uptake of the treatment, according to doctors who perform the procedure.

The CMS decision on October 28 covers two renal denervation devices, Recor's Paradise ultrasound system and Medtronic's Symplicity Spyral radiofrequency system, which were approved by the FDA in 2023. A third device, the TIVUS ultrasound system from Boston Scientific, is in clinical trials and not included in the CMS decision.

The decision was made under the Coverage with Evidence Development process, meaning procedures will only be covered if they are performed as part of a CMS-approved study.

Renal denervation is a minimally invasive catheter-based therapy for patients with uncontrolled hypertension whose blood pressure is not adequately managed with lifestyle changes and medication. It targets the nerves around the kidney with ultrasound or radiofrequency energy to calm the overactive sympathetic nerves that play an important role in hypertension.

Jiandong Zhang, MD, a cardiologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, said he hopes the CMS approval will increase uptake of the procedure for those who need it.

“As an interventional cardiologist I've performed this procedure and been involved with the clinical trials, and I'm very excited about the approval. But I also want to be cautious about it,” Zhang said. “This is not a procedure for everybody with high blood pressure. We need to be very careful with patient selection.”

Patients need to understand that the procedure is not a cure and that they will still need to continue taking their medications, he said.

Despite evidence of safety and efficacy, uptake of the technique since 2023 has been limited, Zhang said, partly because it was not covered by CMS. And private insurers tend to follow the agency's lead on which procedures should be eligible for reimbursement, he noted.

Naomi Fisher, MD, an endocrinologist and hypertension specialist at Mass General Brigham in Boston, said the underwhelming uptake of the procedure is also a hangover from the disappointing results of one early clinical trial. After two very promising studies, the Symplicity HTN-3 trial showed no significant difference in blood pressure reduction between the treatment and sham groups, and almost killed the entire field. “There were about 50 companies in this space, and all but twofolded,” Fisher said.

Improvements to the devices and the study methodology in second-generation trials led to better results and approval of two devices. But that one null result has had a lasting impact. “Many providers still think the field is dead because there was so much negativity around it,” Fisher said.

The CMS decision should help to alleviate some of those concerns, she added.

Fisher said there is an additional benefit of the CMS deciding to cover renal denervation, which is that it is shining a spotlight on the control of hypertension. “Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for death around the world, but awareness and control have taken a back seat for decades,” she said. “So as a result of all the attention being paid to having a new device to treat it, we're giving attention to controlling high blood pressure, which makes me really optimistic.”

Both companies welcomed the CMS decision.

“This is a transformative milestone for patients across the US who continue to battle uncontrolled hypertension,” Lara Barghout, CEO of Recor Medical, said in a news release. “CMS is paving the way for broader, more equitable access to this breakthrough therapy.”

“This milestone enables physicians to offer patients more choices when managing hypertension, potentially leading to better outcomes for a population in urgent need of new options,” Jason Weidman, president of Medtronic's Coronary & Renal Denervation business, said in a news release.

Fisher reported consulting income from Medtronic, Recor, and Boston Scientific, as well as a research grant from Recor. Zhang reported no relevant financial conflicts.

Working out of a tribal-owned hospital in Anchorage, Alaska, liver specialist Brian McMahon has spent decades treating the long shadow of hepatitis B. Before a vaccine became available in the 1980s, he saw the virus claim young lives in western Alaskan communities with stunning speed.

One of his patients was 17 years old when he first examined her for stomach pain. McMahon discovered she had developed liver cancer caused by hepatitis B, just weeks before she was set to graduate from high school as valedictorian. She died before the ceremony.

McMahon thinks often of an 8-year-old boy who showed no signs of illness until he complained of pain from what turned out to be a rapidly growing tumor on his liver.

McMahon can still hear his voice.

"He was moaning in pain, saying, 'I know I am going to die soon,'" he recalled. "We were all crying." The boy died at home a week later.

The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids, even in microscopic amounts, and the virus can survive on surfaces for a week. Like many of his patients, McMahon said, both children contracted hepatitis B at birth or in early childhood.

That outcome is now preventable. A birth dose of the vaccine, recommended for newborns since 1991, is up to 90% effective in preventing infection from the mother if given in the first 24 hours of life. If babies receive all three doses, 98% of them have immunity from the incurable virus, with the protection lasting at least 30 years.

In the communities of western Alaska, years of targeted testing and widespread vaccination efforts led to the number of cases plummeting.

"Liver cancer has disappeared in children," McMahon said. "We haven't seen a case since 1995. Nor do we have any children under 30 that have gotten infected that we know of."

He worries those hard-won gains could soon be rolled back.

A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to discuss and vote on the hepatitis B birth dose recommendation during its two-day meeting starting Dec. 4, potentially limiting children's access.

On Tucker Carlson's podcast in June, Kennedy falsely claimed that the hepatitis B birth dose is a "likely culprit" of autism.

He also said the hepatitis B virus is not "casually contagious." But decades of research shows the virus can be transmitted through indirect contact, when traces of infected fluids like blood enter the body when people share personal items like razors or toothbrushes.

The committee's recommendations carry weight. Most private insurers must cover the vaccines the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices endorses, and many state vaccination policies are directly linked to its guidelines.

Neither ACIP nor the CDC is regulatory. They cannot mandate immunizations. It's up to states to do that. But keeping the recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine at birth preserves the widest range of options for families. They can choose to vaccinate at birth, wait until later in childhood, or not vaccinate at all, and insurance will continue to cover the cost of the shot as long as it remains approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

Two senior FDA officials — Commissioner Marty Makary and top vaccine regulator Vinay Prasad — suggested at the end of November that changes to the vaccine approval process may be coming. Vaccines must be approved by the FDA to be administered in the United States.

In internal agency emails obtained by PBS NewsHour and The Washington Post, Prasad questioned the routine practice of "giving multiple vaccines at the same time." It's not clear whether he was referring to combination vaccines that offer immunity against multiple diseases with a single shot. Three of the nine hepatitis B vaccines currently approved by the FDA are combination vaccines. The birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine is given only as a stand-alone vaccine.

If private insurers opt to still cover the shot, misinformation from the meeting still could lead families to falsely believe the vaccine could harm their babies, said Sean O'Leary, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

"Whatever comes out of this disaster of a meeting in December is going to be mainly designed around sowing distrust and spreading fear," he said.

President Donald Trump, Kennedy, and some newly appointed ACIP members have mischaracterized how the liver disease spreads, ignoring or downplaying the risk of transmission through indirect contact. The hepatitis B virus is far more infectious than HIV. Unvaccinated people, including children, can get infected from microscopic amounts of blood on a tabletop or toy, even when the infected person is asymptomatic.

McMahon has cared for children who tested negative at birth and later became infected through indirect contact. In a study in the 1970s, nearly a third of such children went on to develop chronic hepatitis B without ever showing symptoms, he said.

"It's a very infectious virus," McMahon said. "That's why giving everybody the birth dose is the best way to prevent it."

The CDC recommends that all pregnant people be screened for hepatitis B, but it estimates that up to 16% are not tested and fall through the cracks. O'Leary and other experts say testing mothers for the virus shortly before or after delivery is unfeasible, because most hospitals lack the staff and resources.

The three-dose vaccine has a long track record of safety. Numerous studies show it is not associated with an increased risk of infant death, fever or sepsis, multiple sclerosis, or autoimmune conditions, and severe reactions are rare.

"We have an incredible safety profile," O'Leary said. "No one expects to get in a car wreck, right? And yet we all put our seat belts on. This is similar."

The CDC estimates that 2.4 million people in the U.S. have hepatitis B and that half do not know they are infected. The disease can range from an acute infection to a chronic one, often with few to no symptoms. If the disease is left untreated, it can lead to serious conditions such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. There is no cure.

William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP, said some parents struggle to understand why a healthy newborn needs a vaccine so soon after birth, especially for a virus they feel certain they don't have and often wrongly associate only with risky behaviors. Those perceptions, he said, mix with declining trust in public health and rising skepticism about vaccines.

His advice to expectant parents who are on the fence is to talk to their doctor about the shots. Even if the pregnant woman has tested negative, he said, it's still important to give the baby the birth dose, because false negatives are possible and because the virus can spread so easily from surface contact. Babies who receive the full vaccine series starting from birth have their chance of liver cancer reduced by 84%.

"If you wait a month and if the mom happens to be positive, or the baby picks it up from a caregiver, by that time the infection is established in that baby's liver," Schaffner said. "It's too late to prevent that infection."

He said that if fewer people get vaccinated, hepatitis B will circulate at higher rates in American communities and the risk of contracting the virus will rise for everyone who doesn't get the shots.

And more hepatitis B cases could mean higher costs for patients and the broader health care system. The CDC estimates treating someone with a less severe form of the disease costs $25,000 to $94,000 per year. For patients who require a liver transplant, annual medical expenses can climb above $320,000, depending on their treatment.

Over the past 30 years, the main adverse events parents have reported from their babies receiving the birth dose have been fussiness and crying, both of which pass quickly. Schaffner said that's a very strong safety profile — for a newborn vaccine with a track record of protecting babies from an incurable disease.

"The data are so clear about this," Schaffner said. "A whole array now of other countries have initiated this program. They've modeled it on us."

Bedfont® Scientific Limited, world leaders in breath analysis, with over 48 years of experience in designing and manufacturing medical breath analysis devices, has collaborated with Rbeck Healtech Private to make Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) testing more accessible in India. Rbeck Healthtech Private is an entirely diverse healthcare equipment distributor, with a portfolio specializing in pulmonology, cardiology, and rehabilitation. It has recently added the innovative NObreath® device to its offerings, expanding access to FeNO testing in India.

Asthma is a chronic lung disease which cannot be cured; however, with the correct diagnosis and treatment, people with asthma can lead normal lives. India accounts for approximately 13.1 % of the global asthma burden, meaning that improving access to essential diagnostic and management tools, such as the NObreath®, is vital. The NObreath® measures FeNO levels on exhaled breath, a key indicator in type 2 airway inflammation, which is commonly found in asthma.

Partnering with Rbeck Healthtech and the successful registration for the NObreath® in India is a meaningful milestone in our mission to make precision asthma care accessible worldwide. India faces a significant burden of asthma, and we believe that FeNO testing can empower clinicians with clearer insights into airway inflammation, leading to more personalized and effective treatment decisions.

Jason Smith, CEO, Bedfont®

With the Global Asthma Report 2022 indicating that a considerable proportion of asthmatic individuals remain underdiagnosed or untreated in India, it is hoped that this strategic partnership will help expand the accessibility of FeNO testing in the region, ultimately saving lives.

A study led by McMaster University researchers shows that a widely available and inexpensive medication not only prevents potentially serious stomach bleeding in critically ill patients, but also saves hospitals thousands of dollars. 

Published in JAMA Network Open on Dec. 1, 2025, the study is the first to demonstrate the economic benefits of the medication, pantoprazole, when prescribed in hospital for mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). These patients on life support are at high risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, a complication caused by stress-induced ulcers in the stomach that can prolong hospital stays and increase costs. 

In an era of rising health-care costs, interventions that are both clinically effective and cost-saving are rare. Pantoprazole checks both boxes."

Feng Xie, Professor, Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact, McMaster University

The findings build on the landmark Re-evaluating the Inhibition of Stress Erosions (REVISE) Trial led by McMaster, which established pantoprazole's clinical effectiveness in preventing bleeding. The trial was run in 68 centres in eight countries and over 4,800 patients were enrolled. 

Until now, the economic impact of prescribing pantoprazole each day for patients on breathing machines had been unclear. The researchers conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using international data from the REVISE trial, comparing outcomes and resource use between patients who received pantoprazole daily and those who did not. The results have significant implications for critical care practitioners, pharmacy departments, and policymakers. 

"Pantoprazole costs between 50 cents and two dollars per dose across the country, yet our analysis showed how prescribing it to invasively ventilated patients can save healthcare resources by reducing bleeding events and reducing length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital," said senior author Deborah Cook, a professor in the Department of Medicine at McMaster. 

"In the expensive, high-technology ICU setting, this is a simple, low-cost intervention that improves outcomes and reduces health-care costs," adds Cook, a critical care physician practising at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton. 

This economic evaluation, E-REVISE, was funded by grants from the Hamilton Academic Health Sciences Organization and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research. The REVISE Trial was funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, the Accelerating Clinical Trials Fund, Physicians Services Incorporated of Ontario, Hamilton Association of Health Sciences Organization, and the National Health Medical Research Council of Australia.

A new study, led by the University of Vienna and the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, shows how the eyes of adult marine bristleworms continue to grow throughout life – driven by a ring of neural stem cells reminiscent of vertebrate eyes. What's more, these stem cells respond to environmental light. The research, published in Nature Communications, offers new insight into the fundamental principles of eye evolution and the role of light in shaping the adult nervous system – even in organisms often considered rather simple.

When imagining creatures with complex eyes, most people think of mammals, birds, or maybe octopuses. Yet annelid worms from the sea – such as the bristleworm Platynereis dumerilii – also have eyes structured much like those of vertebrates and cephalopods, known as "camera-type" eyes, and some of them are capable of surprisingly high-resolution vision. But how do these invertebrate eyes continue to grow throughout adult life? An international research team from the University of Vienna, the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, and the University of Oldenburg has now taken a closer look at this question – and obtained intriguing new insights.

Camera-type eyes in invertebrates and vertebrates are textbook examples of parallel evolution, thought to have arisen independently as similar solutions to the same biological challenge. To explore how such eyes continue to develop, the team examined adult eyes of Platynereis – a model system long used to study fundamental principles of photoreceptor function and brain evolution.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, first author Nadja Milivojev from the Department of Neurosciences and Developmental Biology, University of Vienna, identified molecular markers characteristic of stem cells and mapped where these cells are located and active in the worm's retina. Her analyses revealed a distinct zone at the rim of the retina, densely packed with neural stem cells that actively divide when the adult eye is growing.

It was remarkable to find dividing cells at the edge of the worm's retina – the same place where some groups of vertebrates maintain their retinal stem cells for life-long eye growth." 

Nadja Milivojev, Department of Neurosciences and Developmental Biology, University of Vienna

Indeed, this so-called "ciliary marginal zone" is thought to support continuous eye growth - a pattern now mirrored in the bristleworm retina. "In vertebrate examples of life-long growth as fishes and amphibians – such stem cells supply the eye with fresh retinal neurons while the animal develops," explains senior author Florian Raible, University of Vienna, whose lab has a long-standing track record in research on stem cell biology. "Remarkably, Nadja's work showed that bristleworm eyes can also add new photoreceptor cells and expand their size – a trait that has not been well studied outside the vertebrate lineage", Raible adds.

Even more fascinating, the research team discovered that eye growth in adult worms is also regulated by light in their environment. Through detailed genetic and molecular analyses, they showed that this effect is mediated by a c-opsin, a light-sensitive molecule, also present in the rod and cone cells of vertebrate retinas. While previous studies had shown that worm eyes rely on a different family of opsin molecules, the new findings on the presence of a vertebrate-type c-opsin came as a major surprise. Milivojev and colleagues discovered that this light-sensitive molecule is present in early precursors of the worm's photoreceptor cells, suggesting that it acts as a molecular switch linking environmental light to stem cell activity. The discovery highlights that visual systems not only sense light, but that their development can be regulated by light as well.

The findings close a long-standing gap in understanding how invertebrate and vertebrate eyes grow and maintain themselves. The discovery that Platynereis eyes rely on a ring of neural stem cells brings biologists closer to understanding universal principles behind sensory organ evolution. It also raises new questions. Could other neural stem cells in the body also respond to environmental light? And how might artificial illumination disrupt such natural regulatory systems? The researchers hope that future work on the worm's stem cell machinery will help answer these questions – shedding light, quite literally, on how the nervous system adapts and regenerates.

"Clearly, basic research to uncover the unexpected is essential to understand the biological complexity of life and the possible consequences of anthropgenic impacts," concludes senior author Kristin Tessmar-Raible, University of Vienna, Alfred Wegener Institute, University of Oldenburg.

A team led by Aston University's Professor Rebecca Knibb in the School of Psychology has been awarded a grant by the US National Peanut Board (NPB) to develop an online food allergy support tool.

Food Allergy Coping Empowerment Tools and Support, or FACETS, is a self-directed online support tool for coping with food allergy for adults with food allergy and for caregivers of children with food allergy. FACETS is based on psychological theory such as cognitive behavioural therapy, and has been developed by psychologists, adult patients and caregivers based in the UK, US, Australia and Canada. It focuses on aspects patients and caregivers said they needed support with.

FACETS, which is still under development, is interactive and has a number of modules, such as managing anxiety and communicating about food allergy. The modules include information and exercises to do, for example practising asking about allergens in a restaurant. There are sections where the user can answer questions or set goals and the system saves these, as well as the user's progress as they work through each module. The tool is being developed in conjunction with Design Factory Birmingham, a creative design and digital innovation space at Aston University,

FACETS forms part of the Global Access to Psychological Services (GAPS) study, a multinational collaboration of researchers, clinicians, patients and patient organizations, who have been exploring psychological support needs and people's experiences of healthcare services across more than 20 countries worldwide.

Professor Knibb said:

"The money from NPB will let us build further modules requested by patients and caregivers, such as managing stress, and we will also work with adolescents to develop modules specifically for them. We will then test the effectiveness of the new modules in a pilot study to see if they also reduce anxiety, improve quality of life and self-efficacy. The end goal is to be able to provide FACETS free to anyone who wishes to use it. Before we can do that, we need to ensure it is helpful - which is why it is not publicly available yet. The research will be run next year and FACETS will be made available to the public once the programme has been evaluated."

The grant to Professor Knibb and the FACETS team is one of nine given by the NPB in its most recent round of funding for food allergy research, which totalled more than US$450,000. It was the only grant given outside the US.

The National Peanut Board is proud to play a catalytic role in allergy research - often providing the seed funding that allows promising projects in prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management to attract additional investment and create broader impact for families and patients."

Researchers led by a team from Mass General Brigham and the Ragon Institute have discovered why some people living with HIV who are given a treatment called broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies (bNAbs) can safely stop taking standard, lifelong HIV medications and maintain control of the virus for years, while others given the same treatment do not achieve this remission. The findings, which are published in Nature, could potentially be used to design combination therapies that work for more people.

Our results show that some people can go on to control the virus on their own without treatment because of a property of a type of killer T cell. This is an important insight into how the body's natural defenses can be harnessed to achieve durable HIV remission."

David Collins, PhD, senior author, investigator at the Ragon Institute of Mass General Brigham, MIT, and Harvard

For their study, Collins and colleagues analyzed blood samples from 12 people in four different clinical trials who received bNAbs and then stopped standard antiretroviral therapy. They compared samples from the seven participants who could control HIV after bNAb treatment for up to seven years (that is, keep the virus at very low levels) with samples from five participants who experienced viral rebound. They found that immune cells called CD8+ T cells of "post-intervention controllers" could multiply well and kill HIV cells efficiently. While bNAb treatment boosted these abilities, what mattered most was having these CD8+ T cell features before treatment.

"Control wasn't uniquely linked to the development of new types of responses; it was the quality of existing CD8+ T cell responses that appeared to make the difference," Collins explained. "Immunotherapies capable of enhancing virus-specific CD8+ T cells' capacity to respond to and fight infection, and capable of restoring the cells' ability to proliferate or renew themselves in all recipients, may dramatically enhance the likelihood of durable HIV remission elicited by bNAb administration." 

Prospective studies with additional participants are needed to support the implication that HIV-specific CD8+ T cell features can predict responses to bNAb therapy and might also be targeted to allow more people living with HIV to benefit from this line of treatment.

"Efforts are underway to induce the same immune system properties we see in the post-intervention controllers in persons living with HIV," said Bruce Walker, MD, a co-author on the study and director of the Ragon Institute at Mass General Brigham. "Whether we will succeed remains to be seen, but I am cautiously optimistic."

Scientists at The University of Texas at El Paso have found a promising new target in the fight against high-grade serous carcinoma, an aggressive form of ovarian cancer. Less than 50 percent of women survive five years after diagnosis, according to the team.

A new study published in the journal Scientific Reports shows that Claudin-4, a protein that increases in ovarian cancer, may be the culprit behind the cancer's resistance, helping tumors both survive and hide from the body's natural defense, the immune system. The study was led by UTEP postdoctoral researcher Fabian R. Villagomez, Ph.D., and Benjamin G. Bitler, Ph.D., of the University of Colorado Anschutz.

The research team studied tumors growing in animal models that have an immune system similar to humans. Targeting Claudin-4 helped the immune system better find and attack the tumors, making the cancer more vulnerable to treatment.

Villagomez explained that cancer cells often carry alterations in their genetic material that make them more aggressive and grow uncontrollably. But if these alterations become too extreme, the immune system can detect and attack the tumor.

"Claudin-4 seems to help the tumor deal with these genetic changes, allowing it to survive, hide from the immune system, and avoid cell death," said Villagomez, who works in the Department of Biological Sciences at the UTEP College of Science.

The team tested a peptide called CMP, which can block Claudin-4, along with a drug called a PARP inhibitor, commonly used to treat ovarian cancer.

The combination was effective, the team said. When applied together, tumor growth slowed and the body's immune system worked better than before at fighting the cancer.

While the treatment has not yet been tested in humans, Villagomez plans to continue studying ovarian cancer and Claudin-4. He hopes to build a research network with other universities to combine efforts and one day help get the treatment to patients.

A new generation of targeted treatments and gentler chemotherapy options for older adults with a new diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is driving better survival and cure rates. Led by Mikkael Sekeres, M.D., M.S., chief of the Division of Hematology at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, the updated 2025 American Society of Hematology (ASH) AML treatment guidelines, appear Dec. 1, 2025, in the journal Blood Advances.In addition, the updated guidelines will be presented Dec . 7 at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting in Orlando.

"The landscape of AML treatment has changed dramatically with more effective therapies," said Sekeres. "Our clinical studies have led to FDA approval of three drugs to treat acute leukemia over the past two years." But incorporating these new drugs into patients' regimens is a long process.

A physician-scientist, Sekeres led the 2020 and updated 2025 official ASH AML guideline panels. The panels include leukemia experts, geriatricians and patients who reviewed and discussed the best available research. The guideline recommendations aim to walk patients and their doctors through the AML treatment decisions in a meaningful and relevant way.

For decades, the standard treatment for AML was intensive chemotherapy to destroy leukemia cells and induce remission rapidly. Even just 20 years ago, two-thirds of people over 65 didn't get access to chemotherapy.

We developed these guidelines to mirror the experience of an older adult's conversations with their doctor as they're considering treatment. The very first of those conversations is whether or not a person should receive any treatment. We didn't shy away from hard questions that patients and doctors ask, and I'm really proud of that."

Mikkael Sekeres, M.D., M.S., chief of the Division of Hematology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center

Over the last decade, treatments such as gentler chemotherapy regimens, low-dose treatments, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies have improved AML care. More older adults are achieving remission and even pursuing cures like bone marrow transplants.

While AML treatment is more personalized, the decisions are more complex. "We're tailoring therapy more and more for each patient based on their age, fitness and genetic profile," said Justin Watts, M.D., Sylvester's chief of the leukemia section in the Division of Hematology. "Their genes tell us if they qualify for targeted therapies and can predict their risk level for relapse - so tell us if they need a transplant."

In most cases, older adults should be offered treatment for AML, not just supportive care, the new guidelines say. Patients who are healthy enough, especially those in their 60s or with favorable disease genetics, should still get intensive chemotherapy. If a patient isn't a candidate for intensive chemotherapy, they should consider lower-intensity options like hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine) or low-dose cytarabine. These treatments can be combined with venetoclax, a targeted therapy.

If genetic testing finds a specific gene change, older adults should be offered targeted therapies as part of their AML treatment plan. Patients with FLT3 mutations should receive a FLT3 inhibitor, and those with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations should receive a combination of azacitidine with targeted inhibitors, such as ivosidenib or venetoclax.

When a patient is in remission, they may be a candidate for a bone marrow transplant. Transplants can help older adults live longer, so the committee overwhelmingly recommends them for more patients with high-risk diseases, said Sekeres. Improvements in the transplant process and the use of donors who are not a perfect match have made this an option for more people. If a patient isn't a candidate for transplant, they should continue post-remission therapy with gentler combination treatments, the guidelines say. These maintenance therapies can help prevent relapse.

"Finally, we made recommendations regarding blood transfusions for people who are getting palliative care or hospice," Sekeres said. Many hospices deny people with leukemia transfusions, "so we very definitively said that we consider blood product transfusions as a part of palliative care and hospice."

New, advanced tools are helping researchers better detect minimal residual disease and understand relapse risk - leading to better decisions about who needs a transplant, said Watts. "We're making steady progress every year by better defining patient groups," and finding the right treatments for them, he added. "We're moving more patients into the 'favorable benefit group' - the group of patients who do well on these new therapies and live longer."

Emma Hinchliffe is Fortune's Most Powerful Women editor, overseeing editorial for the longstanding franchise. As a senior writer at Fortune, Emma has covered women in business and gender-lens news across business, politics, and culture. She is the lead author of the Most Powerful Women Daily newsletter (formerly the Broadsheet), Fortune's daily missive for and about the women leading the business world.

Billionaire Michele Kang has made a splash in women's sports with her goal of professionalizing women's soccer. She owns the Washington Spirit, the London City Lionesses, OL Lyonnes, and in 2024 launched Kynisca, a women's sports organization to power it all. Now, Fortune is the first to report, she's launching the Kang Women's Institute, an organization within U.S. Soccer's Soccer Forward foundation. It promises to research the needs of female athletes, from their specific requirements for injury recovery and reentry after pregnancy to best practices for coaching girls in youth sports.

Kang started this work through her own organization; after buying three clubs, she noticed problems compared to men's sports. “Why do we have more ACL injuries? Why don't we have enough female coaches and referees?” she was asking after entering the space with the capital she earned from selling her health care IT company. Earlier this year, she merged Kynisca's innovation hub with U.S. Soccer in the hopes that the federation's brand-name convening power would get researchers and study participants on board faster. In total, she's committed $55 million to this work, $25 million for the new institute with projects already in the works with UNC and Duke and $30 million for specific programs for youth sports and coaching. Kang has previously announced her financial commitments and is announcing the launch of the new institute today.





Only 6% of global sports science research globally focuses on women. Kang says that's because of less attention paid to women both in sports and in health research more broadly. “It's an overall bias in society,” she says. In sports, women have been treated as “small men,” she says. 





Emma Hayes, coach of the U.S. Women's National Team and former manager of Chelsea Women where she won seven titles, served as a key adviser on this effort.  “The whole system is based on copy and paste from the men's game,” she says. 





Hayes realized the detrimental effects that treating women athletes the same as men could have about a decade ago, when three of her players at Chelsea had ACL injuries in one year. Physical therapists didn't understand why women weren't coming back in the same six- to seven-month window as men. They didn't factor in that “we don't have as much testosterone, so we don't build muscle in the same way,” she recalls. If their rehab could have incorporated those factors from the beginning, the players might have been better served. Then when Chelsea was in the FA Cup, several players on the team were all in the final phase of their menstrual cycle, and it affected their reaction times. She wanted to understand how to train across nutrition and performance to account for these realities.




More recently, the U.S. Women's National Team has had multiple players become pregnant and give birth. She wants to not just support players when they return to play, but help them throughout their pregnancies—like understanding when and how to train, and accounting for that player's specific experience of pregnancy. When they do come back, their return to play plan should take into account whether they had a vaginal birth or a C-section. 





The Kang Institute plans to tackle all of this. At Kang's clubs, players wear Oura rings to track their health data and train based on those insights. 





It's a radical departure from where U.S. Soccer was just a few years ago—settling a lawsuit with players over their fight for equal pay. The lawsuit was settled in 2022, and Hayes joined as coach in 2024. Kang started getting involved in women's sports almost four years ago. 





Some of the most fascinating work, however, will happen at the youth level. The pipeline into women's soccer starts young; many professional women's athletes credit Title IX with creating the opportunity for them to reach the pros. Research shows that girls often drop out of sports around age 12—just as they're entering puberty and dealing with body confidence issues. Youth sports coaches should be trained how to handle the sensitive time in girls' lives, Hayes says. “It's not as simple as just going to the field with an extra tampon and a sanitary towel, though that would be helpful,” she says. “Everything from ensuring we don't wear white shorts to what are the best ways for having challenging conversations in what is a really tricky period for young girls? How might we support when body images plays such an important part of their own self-confidence?”





The Kang Institute has officially committed to launching the first nationwide study focused on the needs of female athletes; collaborating with the NWSL and USL, the two main professional leagues, to establish research-backed standards in player health, safety protocols, and training methods; and creating tools and resources to support athlete well-being. 




For Kang, the work in youth sports achieves a social mission and future proofs her own clubs and sport for the decades ahead. Girls' soccer programs in the U.S. have less infrastructure and support compared to Europe, and American clubs are fighting to keep players like the Washington Spirit's Trinity Rodman in the U.S., where salary caps limit how much stars can earn. 





“We have to make sure that we invest in really showing the clear path,” she says, “so that young girls can aspire to be the next Alex Morgan, the next Trinity Rodman.”

A new simulation of the 2026 FIFA World Cup group stage draw handed the U.S. men's national team an immediate challenge, while the other two host nations, Mexico and Canada, could also be in for difficult games.

The official World Cup group stage draw takes place on Friday, with supporters from around the world preparing to learn the fates of their country. 42 of the 48 participants are confirmed, and they will learn their first three opponents for the tournament when the draw takes place—those still to contest the playoffs in March will also know what awaits them should they get through.

All countries heading to North America next summer are hopeful of avoiding one thing: the dreaded group of death.

And a new mock draw conducted by Sports Illustrated has handed Mauricio Pochettino and his USMNT side a difficult, yet manageable route through to the knockout stages.

Group D

USA

Croatia

Tunisia

New Zealand

The U.S. is joined by Croatia, Tunisia and New Zealand in Group D.

Led by Luka Modrić, Croatia would represent a difficult challenge early in the tournament. On the flipside, it could be the perfect test to see how prepared the USMNT truly is. Croatia finished third and second respectively at the last two World Cups and can never be counted out. 

As far as marquee matchups go, Christian Pulisic battling his AC Milan teammate would certainly meet the criteria.

Pochettino and his men would likely fancy their chances of at least finishing second if they draw Tunisia and New Zealand. The former failed to advance past the group stage in 2018 and 2022, while the latter have qualified for their first World Cup since 2010.

The Croatia game would probably determine who tops Group D.

Here are the rest of the groups from the latest Sports Illustrated simulation ahead of the real thing:

(Check out our previous simulation here!)

Group A

Mexico

Colombia

Scotland

Jordan

Host nation Mexico is drawn against Colombia, Scotland and Jordan—a difficult group that threatens El Tri's chances of advancing to the bracket.

Colombia will be led by Bayern Munich star Luis Díaz, hoping to go one step further than a runner-up finish in the 2024 Copa América. Scotland features established talents like Andy Robertson, Scott McTominay and Kieran Tierney. Given the nature of their last-minute qualification, Scotland will be relishing their opportunity to perform next summer.

A win against Jordan, a first-time qualifier, could see Mexico through as a third-place team. A draw could bring their tournament to an early end.

Group B

Canada

Morocco

Saudi Arabia

Italy, Northern Ireland, Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina

Canada's simulated opponents include Morocco, Saudi Arabia and an undetermined playoff team—Italy, Northern Ireland, Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina. 

Morocco looks to improve on their fourth place finish from 2022, while Saudi Arabia notably pulled off the upset of that tournament beating Argentina in the group stage.

Whoever joins the Group B field would massively influence the third host nation's chances of advancing. If it's Italy, Canada could be eliminated from the group stage. The other three wouldn't necessarily be walks in the park either.

Group C

Argentina

Australia

South Africa

Haiti

Argentina would be licking their lips if this is their group next summer. 

The reigning World Cup champions would, barring some catastrophic occurrence, be heavily favored to top this group. Given Argentina wouldn't meet Spain, the other tournament favorite, until the final based on the group stage draw rules, Lionel Messi could be primed for a Hollywood ending to his international career.

Group E

Portugal

Iran

Panama

Cabo Verde

The World Cup is often used as the one trophy against Cristiano Ronaldo's legendary career. He might not need to win it, at least in his mind, but adding the most prestigious international honor to his cabinet would certainly reignite the greatest of all time debate.

Portugal was drawn against Iran, Panama and Cabo Verde. If this group comes to light, Ronaldo should top this group all things considered.

Group F

Germany

Uruguay

Qatar

Ghana

Germany, on paper, have the talent to go deep in 2026, although lifting the trophy might be one step too far forJulian Nagelsmann right now. But simulated opponents in Uruguay and Ghana would offer litmus tests straight away. If they top their group, Die Mannschaft could be in for a memorable summer.

On the other hand, unfavorable results could doom the 2014 winners to a third-place finish and a difficult knockout stage run.

Group G

Brazil

Senegal

Norway

Ukraine, Sweden, Poland or Albania

Brazil, Senegal and Norway would already represent the group of death at any World Cup. Throw Ukraine, Sweden or Poland into the mix and you've got the most exciting matches of the opening round.

This proposed group is full of star talents like Vinicius Junior, Sadio Mane, Erling Haaland and more. If Sweden joins, then there's Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyökeres. Poland would introduce Robert Lewandowski in likely his final World Cup ever. 

It's near impossible to predict how this group would play out, but have popcorn on standby if it becomes reality.

Group H

Netherlands

Japan

Paraguay

Denmark, North Macedonia, Czechia or Republic of Ireland

The Netherlands nearly upset eventual winners Argentina in 2022 losing on penalties. Wout Weghorst's heroics in extra time only delayed elimination and the Oranje will be eager to prove themselves in North America. 

Japan, Paraguay and a playoff team of either Denmark, North Macedonia, Czechia or the Republic of Ireland certainly offer a talented side like Netherlands the platform to top their group and go on a run.

Group I

France

Austria

Algeria

Curaçao

It's Didier Deschamps's last go at the World Cup with France in 2026. Les Bleus nearly became the first team since Brazil in 1958 and 1962 to win consecutive World Cups, losing to Argentina in the 2022 final in a tense penalty shootout.

France remain one of the most talented, if not the most talented team on paper heading in 2026. Given the emotional nature of Deschamps's final tournament, France should not be overlooked as a potential winner.

Group J

Spain

Switzerland

Egypt

Iraq, Bolivia or Suriname

Lamine Yamal knows very well if he helps Spain win a World Cup next summer he could become the youngest Ballon d'Or winner of all time. The Barcelona prodigy is already a superstar at the club and national team levels and Spain are absolutely loaded with talent.

The Euro 2024 winners are a favorite to go all the way next summer, with a simulated group of Switzerland, Egypt and one of Iraq, Bolivia or Suriname offering important tests along the way.

Group K

England

Ecuador

Uzbekistan

DR Congo, New Caledonia or Jamaica

Thomas Tuchel was brought in to take England one step further than Sir Gareth Southgate's iterations of the Three Lions. 

Back-to-back runner-up finishes at the Euros, combined with a quarterfinal exit in Qatar, have the country believing football could truly be coming home. 

Ecuador would be England's toughest test here. That game could easily determine who finishes top in Group K, while Uzbekistan and a playoff side of either DR Congo, New Caledonia or Jamaica hope they can amass enough points to move on as a third-place team.

Group L

Belgium

South Korea

Ivory Coast

Türkiye, Romania, Slovakia or Kosovo

Group L could easily be tagged as another group of death.

Belgium's golden generation might not have the silverware it hoped to conquer, but there are still heaps of talent in the squad. South Korea and Son Heung-min will likely have a massive following throughout the tournament given how the latter exploded onto the MLS scene with LAFC. 

If Türkiye joins Ivory Coast and company, fans won't want to miss out on Group L. If it's Romania, Slovakia or Kosovo, predicting who advances might be a little easier.

Mauricio Pochettino's project with the USMNT is moving forward with high expectations ahead of the 2026 World Cup, but his long-term future looks increasingly uncertain. While the United States prepares to host the world's biggest football event, the Argentine coach is beginning to attract attention from major European clubs —a dynamic that could cut his American chapter shorter than expected.






Why Is His Post-World Cup Future Uncertain?


Pochettino's contract expires the moment the World Cup ends. And while national-team cycles often conclude naturally after major tournaments, there is another factor at play: his competitive DNA.

According to former U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel, speaking exclusively to GOAL, Pochettino is a “workaholic” who thrives on daily training, constant player interaction, and hands-on tactical work. None of that exists at the international level, where long stretches without matches or training camps are standard.

For someone who lives for the grind of club football, the national-team rhythm can feel limiting.


What Would Need to Happen for Pochettino to Stay?


Friedel's assessment for GOAL was brutally honest:



If the USMNT has a bad World Cup, Pochettino will not continue.
If the team has an excellent World Cup —or even goes all the way— he likely won't continue either, because top European clubs will immediately chase him.
Only a solid but not extraordinary tournament would realistically open the door for another cycle.



His continuity depends not only on results, but on how he envisions the next four years of his career.






Why Do European Clubs Want Him Back?



Pochettino hasn't hidden it: he misses the Premier League.
In an interview with the BBC, he described England's top flight as “the most competitive league in the world” and made clear that he intends to return to club football sooner rather than later.


Pochettino hasn't hidden it: he misses the Premier League.
In an interview with the BBC, he described England's top flight as “the most competitive league in the world” and made clear that he intends to return to club football sooner rather than later.

His reputation remains untouched. Tottenham, PSG and Chelsea have all experienced his ability to reshape squads, develop young players and build strong football identities. After leading the USMNT on home soil at a globally watched World Cup, his name will be one of the hottest on the coaching market.

Friedel also emphasized a key point: the long periods without training during international duty can feel unnatural for someone as detail-oriented as Pochettino. The lack of daily work doesn't suit his personality.


¿Qué quiere realmente Pochettino?


Aunque disfruta del proyecto estadounidense y valora este momento en su carrera, también piensa en lo que viene: volver al ritmo diario, al vestuario constante, al pulso competitivo del fútbol europeo.


El resultado del Mundial marcará el tono, pero el escenario es evidente:
las puertas de Europa están abiertas y los clubes grandes lo esperan.

Check out our soccer expert's Fulham vs Man City predictions, prior to Tuesday's 2:30pm ET Premier League clash (12/02).

Our betting expert expects a dominant City victory, even though the Cottagers have home advantage.

Even though they achieved some positive results recently, Manchester City haven't won away from home in the Premier League since early October. Pep Guardiola will view the match against Fulham as a significant opportunity to change that.

Regarding injuries, only Mateo Kovacic and Rodri will be sidelined, so there are no new concerns. Meanwhile, their opponents are missing Antonee Robinson and Rodrigo Muniz. Both teams will be very close to what they'd consider full strength.

However, Cityzens have the advantage on paper, as they are the strongest side. Additionally, they have won 18 consecutive games against the Cottagers since 2012. They haven't lost against them since 2009.

Neither side can be considered defensively secure. Fulham kept excellent clean sheets against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Sunderland recently. However, those are two of only five clean sheets they have achieved across all competitions. They also conceded a goal in their victory over Spurs.

Meanwhile, City have only managed to keep one clean sheet in their last eight fixtures, although they won five of them. Even Leeds United, one of the lowest-scoring teams in the division, managed to score two goals at the Etihad over the weekend. Silva will view this game as an opportunity to cause problems.

Historically, this fixture has featured several goals, as well. Over 2.5 goals have been scored in their 10 most recent meetings, and both teams have found the net in five of the last seven. Therefore, there may be value in the goals market in this match.

Phil Foden has started to show signs of improvement after a difficult spell. The England international scored a couple of goals against Borussia Dortmund recently and seemed ready to net in the Premier League. On Saturday, he scored his first league goal since September, and then went on to score the winning goal.

City have plenty of goalscorers and creators, with five players getting goals/assists against Leeds, but Foden's confidence will be high. The 25-year-old has a few G/A against Fulham in the past, so he will be confident in this match. As usual, there's not much value in Erling Haaland to score, so other options should be considered.

Foden is at value to score once again as he steadily approaches a record of 200 direct contributions for his boyhood club.

Fulham have been in great form recently, and will go into this game after an impressive away win against Tottenham Hotspur over the weekend. Marco Silva's men have won three of their last four Premier League games and reached 15th place. Confidence will be high for the Cottagers, especially at Craven Cottage.

Meanwhile, Manchester City bounced back as they scored late to secure victory over Leeds United over the weekend. Defeats to Newcastle United and Bayer Leverkusen weren't helpful, but beating Leeds placed them five points behind Arsenal. Pep Guardiola will be eager to see his side keep their momentum going this Tuesday.

Fulham expected lineup: Leno, Tete, Andersen, Bassey, Sessegnon, Iwobi, Berge, Wilson, King, Chukwueze, Jimenez

Man City expected lineup: Donnarumma; Nunes, Gvardiol, Dias, O'Reilly; Silva, Gonzalez, Cherki; Doku, Haaland, Foden

World Cup

A new bill will be introduced to the United States House of Representatives on Tuesday which seeks to authorize $50million worth of federal funding every year for host cities to use towards transportation and infrastructure of major sporting events.

A draft of the bill, which has been seen by The Athletic, will be introduced by Rep. Rick Larsen, a Democrat who represents Washington's second congressional district. He is also the co-chair of the Congressional Soccer Caucus. In a phone call with The Athletic, he said the bill will be jointly introduced by Republican Rep. Burgess Owens, indicating bipartisan support for the initiative.

Mr. Larsen's home state of Washington will host six games during the men's World Cup in 2026, including the United States men's national team's (USMNT) second group stage game and two knockout games. Rep. Owens may have a local interest because his home state of Utah will host the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City in 2034.

The bill will be known as the ‘Transportation Assistance for Olympic and World Cup Cities Act of 2025'.

Qualifying events would include the Olympics, Paralympics or Special Olympics, as well as the men's and women's FIFA World Cups, plus any multi-day international sporting events as determined by the transportation secretary. The bill will ask for $50m to be authorized for each fiscal year. The amount that can be given to an individual host city will be capped at $10m and the bill says that the administration should “allocate amounts evenly to each host metropolitan planning organization” for an event.

The 2026 men's World Cup, co-hosted by U.S., Canada and Mexico, will be spread across 11 host cities in the U.S.: New York/New Jersey, Boston, Philadelphia, Miami, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco Bay Area.

Hundreds of millions of U.S. tax dollars have already been committed to the World Cup and Olympics. Earlier this year, President Trump's domestic policy bill — coined as ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill' — set aside $625m in federal funding to aid the security costs of hosting the World Cup in 2026. The bill also included an additional $500 million to be made available for “state and local capabilities to detect, identify, track or monitor threats from unmanned aircraft systems (otherwise known as drones)”, which has also become a key security concern for World Cup stadiums and fan festivals. The bill also included $1billion set aside for security, planning and other costs related to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, California.

The World Cup host cities, as per their contracts with FIFA, are expected to carry many of the security costs for the tournament, both at stadiums and in surrounding areas. Many have already dipped into the pockets of city and state taxpayers and funds and sought private support and donations. The vast majority of revenue from the World Cup also goes to FIFA, including ticketing, parking, in-stadium sponsorship and hospitality packages. Host cities are able to sell local sponsorships for fan festivals.

The costs of hosting the tournament are starting to mount for local authorities. As previously reported by The Athletic, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, who represents New Jersey, has previously said MetLife Stadium has already spent $37m on upgrades to enable it to host the final and that New Jersey will take on “$65m in costs for things like transit security for all hubs, bridges, tunnels, and airports”.

Miami-Dade County has already approved $46m for services associated with the World Cup. The spend on local taxpayer dollars has received some pushback, particularly after the Miami-Dade mayor previously asked county departments to make submissions for 10 per cent spending cuts.

Rep. Rick Larsen, however, insists that the economic impact of the World Cup means taxpayers dollars should receive a healthy return.

“I would point to Seattle, which projects the minimum $929million that'll be generated just in King County alone over six World Cup matches,” he said on Monday.

The report of this estimate was made by Oxford Economics, which was contracted by Visit Seattle, the official marketing organization of Seattle and King County.

Mr. Larsen says the broader region will have additional benefits for hotels, restaurants and day-trips. He says: “I can't tell you there's give me a one for one investment – that'll all be decided after the games are done – but we're looking at hosting a Super Bowl sized game every day for three weeks in the United States. That's going to require a massive investment to make this happen.

“The U.S. is benefiting from having people come to the United States and having the best that we can offer. I hope we offer our best, both on the field and off the field. The investment of $50million a year is somewhat peanuts compared to the potential return on investment in return.”

He added: “Host cities are finding they're in varying states of readiness. This isn't just for World Cup. It is a bill thinking for a long term about the need cities have when these large sporting events come to the U.S. and need help.”

Mr. Larsen says that the target is to get the funding into the appropriations bill for transportation by the end of January to ensure it passes through the House, the Senate and the White House in time for the World Cup.

Mr. Larsen also played down concerns that games could yet be relocated from World Cup host cities, amid concerns expressed by President Donald Trump about safety in cities run by Democrat mayors.

“We do big events there all the time,” he said, insisting Seattle is safe and bristling at what he called the President's “empty threats”.

He added: “Big soccer games happen there. We had 70,000 people at the Leagues Cup final between Seattle and Miami. It went great.”

Rep. Owens, the Republican who is jointly introducing the bill, said: “As the host of the 2002 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, Utah knows how to welcome the world, and we're gearing up to do it again in 2034.

“I'm proud to be Utah's top advocate on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and to co-lead this effort to give host cities across America the dependable federal partner they need while preparing to host major international sporting events like the Olympics and World Cup. This support strengthens transportation planning, boosts local collaboration, and ensures the United States is ready to shine on the global stage.”

Everything you need to know about the FIFA World Cup 2026 draw, including key details, schedule and where to watch the event live.

The draw for the men's FIFA World Cup 2026 takes place this Friday, 5 December 2025, setting out the group-stage path for the first 48-team tournament in the competition's history.

Held in Washington, D.C., the event will determine all 12 groups and give fans the first real sense of how the expanded format will look next summer.

Here's what you need to know about how the draw works, when it's happening and how to watch it live.

The draw will divide the 48 qualified and play-off-bound teams into 12 groups of four, using FIFA's latest men's world rankings to allocate nations into four pots.

One team from each pot will be drawn into every group.

The three co-hosts — Canada, Mexico and the United States — are allocated to Pot 1. The nine top teams in the current FIFA rankings are also placed in Pot 1.

The next three pots were decided by the FIFA rankings, with the lowest-ranked qualified teams in Pot 4. The 12 groups for the World Cup will then be formed by one team from each pot.

FIFA's draw constraints state that, in principle, no group may contain more than one team from the same confederation, with the exception of UEFA, which must have at least one but no more than two European teams in each group. In addition, the top four teams in the FIFA rankings – Spain, Argentina, France and England – cannot face each other until the semi-finals, provided they win their groups.

Forty-two of the 48 tournament places have been secured, with the remaining six to be decided in late March 2026 via four European play-offs and a two-path inter-confederation play-off tournament. Those six play-off winners, along with the play-off placeholders at the time of the draw, are all assigned to Pot 4.

The draw will also confirm the pathways through the tournament, with group placings mapped into the expanded 32-team knockout phase (Round of 32 onwards) that follows the group stage.

Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany.

Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Islamic Republic of Iran, Republic of Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia. 

Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa.

Pot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde , Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, four European play-off teams, two intercontinental play-off teams

The FIFA World Cup 2026 draw will be held on Friday 5 December 2025 at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., beginning at 12:00 local time (17:00 GMT). FIFA will confirm group placements during the live ceremony, including the positions of the three co-host nations.

Following the draw, FIFA is scheduled to release the full tournament match schedule — including venues and kick-off times — in a separate broadcast on Saturday 6 December.

The FIFA World Cup 2026 draw will be streamed live worldwide on FIFA's official digital platforms, including FIFA.com and the organisation's YouTube and social media channels. The broadcast begins at 17:00 GMT alongside full studio coverage and draw analysis.

Serie A giants Roma are reportedly eyeing a swoop for Tottenham forward Mathys Tel, who is seen as a potential alternative to Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee. What once looked like a straightforward January approach for Zirkzee has been thrown in to doubt by his stellar display for United at Crystal Palace over the weekend, and the fact Ruben Amorim could be short on attacking options over the next two months.

Zirkzee had endured an excruciating goal drought of nearly eight months, but he finally found the net in United's Premier League win over Palace on Sunday afternoon. His strike was a well-taken equaliser, and it was not only his first since April, when he scored against Lyon in the Europa League, but also his first in England's top flight in close to a year. It was a moment that not only eased personal pressure but also revived questions about his immediate future.

Speaking to TNT Sport after the match, the 23-year-old could barely hide his relief. 

"A great feeling, you know, it's always a good feeling to score but most importantly it got us back into the game." he said. "It was all about the three points today, just very happy that we got them, very important. When asked about the pressure of going without a goal while playing for United he said: “It's one of the biggest clubs in the world and you have to perform, so if you don't score for a long time then it can get to you. But I'm surrounded by great players, great people and we help each other every day and they made it quite easy for me. Today is just a reward I think for patience, hard work and trying to be consistent and I'm just thankful to the manager as well, staff, everyone. A good environment."

Il Messaggero report that the Italian club have been in dialogue with the striker's representatives for weeks. Manager Gian Piero Gasperini has categorised Zirkzee as his priority target, and sporting director Frederic Massara has been pushing to arrange an initial loan agreement. However, Zirkzee's post-match declaration of happiness at United has reportedly unsettled the Serie A club. While his desire for minutes remains known, his public tone of contentment is viewed as a potential obstacle, raising doubts about whether he would push for a mid-season departure. Amorim is also relying on Zirkzee to lead the line while summer signing Benjamin Sesko is out injured, with United's frontline set to be depleted further when Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo head to the AFCON.

With the Zirkzee plan suddenly at risk, Roma are widening their search and Tel has quickly risen to the top of the list. The Tottenham forward has faced his own struggles for game time, offering an opportunity the Giallorossi believe they can exploit. Tel's last Premier League start dates back to October. Although he scored in a 2-2 draw against United, he has since been restricted largely to late substitute appearances, including in Spurs' latest clash with Fulham. Roma see this stagnation as a window to tempt him with a more significant role in Italy.

As January draws closer, Roma must now make a firm decision. Whether they return for Zirkzee with renewed conviction or pivot fully toward Tel may define the direction of their winter window.

PARIS, Dec 2 - Debutants will take centre stage at Friday's 2026 World Cup draw along with concerns over heat, player welfare and the practical challenge of staging football's biggest tournament across three countries during the peak of a North American summer.

For the first time in the tournament's history, 48 teams will be divided into 12 groups of four at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., producing a 104-match schedule across 16 host cities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Soccer's world governing body FIFA has framed the expansion as a watershed moment for inclusivity, opening the door for nations that had never qualified before -- Cape Verde, Uzbekistan, Jordan and Curacao, which, with a population of 150,000, is by far the smallest nation to take part. 

Others, such as Haiti, return after long waits while Italy still need a playoff to try to avoid the embarrassment of missing out on their third World Cup in a row.

The scale of the tournament is heightening scrutiny over conditions for players and supporters, particularly in venues where summer temperatures regularly climb into the high 30s Celsius (mid-90s Fahrenheit).

U.S. host cities, notably in the Midwest, the Southeast and parts of the Southwest, are expected to experience extreme heat and high humidity during June and July, with thunderstorms potentially wreaking havoc with the schedule.

This year's Club World Cup in the U.S. served as a dress rehearsal and scorching heat was a major concern.

Medical experts and players' unions have raised fears of heat stress, dehydration and reduced recovery times, especially in a format where sides may need to play up to eight matches to lift the trophy – one more than in the 32-team events of the past.

FIFA has highlighted the use of indoor or retractable-roof stadiums, including venues in Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and Vancouver, as a key mitigation measure, allowing organisers to control temperatures for a portion of the match programme.

EUROPEAN AUDIENCES

However, many fixtures will still be held in open-air stadiums where cooling systems are not an option and where adjusting kickoffs may be the only immediate protection.

Those kickoff times are not straightforward. Broadcasters are seeking prime-time slots for European and Asian audiences, which could push matches into afternoon hours locally, when the heat is most intense.

Balancing commercial demands with player safety has become one of the central logistical puzzles of the tournament. Venue assignments and start times will only be revealed the day after Friday's draw, when FIFA unveils the updated match schedule.

The ceremony will place teams into four seeding pots based on world rankings and continental rules. The three hosts are seeded into separate groups alongside top-ranked nations such as defending champions Argentina, Spain, France and England.

Provided they win their groups, those teams cannot meet until the later knockout rounds.

POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY

The draw also comes against the backdrop of renewed political uncertainty in the U.S. following the return of Donald Trump to the White House, raising questions over security coordination, immigration protocols and visa processing for teams, officials and travelling supporters.

FIFA has sought to reassure participating nations that operational planning across the three host countries remains unaffected, though the tournament's scale relies heavily on smooth cross-border logistics and consistent entry procedures.

Iran has said it will boycott the draw ceremony in protest at the limited allocation of visas for the Iranian delegation.

FIFA, which said on Monday the 42 teams who had qualified so far would attend, has not responded to requests for comment from Reuters.

For the many debutants and smaller nations appearing in the finals thanks to the tournament's expansion, heat management may be as big a competitive factor as tactical preparation.

For heavyweights chasing the trophy, the draw will determine not only their opponents but also the intensity of the physical road ahead.

Some venues offer climate-controlled environments but in other places squads will be exposed to daytime heat stress and longer flights between matches, variables that could shape squad selection and rotation strategies.

The final will be staged at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey in July, capping a tournament FIFA president Gianni Infantino has billed as "the most inclusive World Cup ever". Yet inclusivity comes at the cost of scale and scale brings complexity.

As the draw is made in Washington, coaches will be searching less for big-name adversaries than for manageable logistics. 

Controlling exposure to the heat may prove as decisive as avoiding the tournament's biggest footballing powers, especially for the teams simply trying to survive the opening rounds in conditions few have faced before.

The new format has also diluted one of the traditional sources of tension in World Cup draws, with the proliferation of groups and protected seeds making the emergence of a true "Group of Death" very unlikely, and reducing the sense of immediate jeopardy that has typically surrounded the ceremony.

Emma Hayes congratulates players after the USWNT's 6-0 victory over New Zealand on October 29, 2025. Jamie Squire / Getty Images

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Back in April, following the U.S. women's national team's 2-1 loss to Brazil in the second leg of the two friendlies, head coach Emma Hayes declared her intent to “put players in the frying pan” and feel the heat.

Eight months later, the USWNT went 10-1, with an overall record of 12-3 on the year. They scored 41 goals and conceded eight. Six of the 11 teams they played are currently ranked among the top 20 in the world, according to FIFA. Most impressively, the USWNT accomplished this as 16 players earned their first senior national team caps, the most in any calendar year in program history.

And yet, Hayes said following the U.S.'s 2-0 win over Italy at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale on Monday night, what she introduced in the spring has not yet become a finished product.

“We're still cooking,” she said. “I think about it being a nice winter dish, like slow-cooked stew, and gets better with more time. It's on the heat, so it gets more tender. I think when I watch our team play, I think you're starting to see the maturity in the performances.”

So concludes a year that has been an exercise in time manipulation. By fortifying pathways to the senior national team, Hayes and her coaching staff — along with under-23 head coach Heather Dyche and under-20 head coach Vicky Jepson, both of whom were hired this year — have been able to compress time for players whose readiness did not match up to the opportunities they were given, and to slow things down for others who were thrust into roles before they were ready.

The project began in January when Hayes named 24 players to the inaugural USWNT Futures Camp. Several of those individuals — like midfielder Claire Hutton, full-backs Lilly Reale and Avery Patterson, center-back Jordyn Bugg, and, most recently, forward Jameese Joseph — have since earned senior team call ups.

That Fort Lauderdale has marked the beginning and the end of their year makes for aggressively on-the-nose poetry, but it wasn't designed that way. Originally, the January camps were to be held in Carson, Calif., but deadly Southern California wildfires required U.S. Soccer to change the location to South Florida.

“It even went back to flying into this airport,” said Patterson, 23, of her Fort Lauderdale memories. “I hadn't been a national team kid growing up, but it was something that was, not a distant goal, but something that you were always striving for that you never quite broke into.”

Patterson, who plays for the Houston Dash in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), has become a standout modern-day full-back for club and country, utilizing her craftiness on the ball to propel herself into the attack. She scored her first national team goal this summer against the Republic of Ireland and has recorded two assists.

Integrating into the USWNT, Patterson added, was easier because of that first Fort Lauderdale camp: “It's all of these terms and this new terminology that's being thrown at you and asked of you to learn in such a short time, but you know it's what's expected at the highest level. It's who can retain that and then apply it to their game.”

As is often the case for perennial winners, the USWNT's richest learning opportunities came from failures. Hutton, another futures camper-turned-senior-team staple this year at 19, recalled lessons from the team's loss to Brazil in April.

“What was so cool about that game, it was a very young squad that was in the lineup,” Hutton said of herself, Korbin Shrader, Lily Yohannes, and Jaedyn Shaw on the eve of the Italy match.

“Alyssa (Thompson) was on the field, and we had a meeting before the game with Emma, primarily of the younger players, and she sat us down and basically told us this was a moment for us to take it with stride and know that it was going to be tough, know that there were going to be moments of struggle, which there were in that game, but it was how we were going to respond and reflect on that.

“And that game was tough,” Hutton emphasized. “I remember leaving it feeling like I just battled in the army.”

But six months later, when the USWNT sought a rebound after a frustrating 2-1 loss to Portugal, Hutton felt prepared. Again, Hayes started younger players in midfield but this time, there was no pre-game sit-down.

“What people would say is less experience, but knowing that we went into that game and had more of a calm presence and did have the experience of that Brazil game and of the games throughout the year, just added a layer and it was just cool to see how much we grew as a group,” she said.

The USWNT won that match against Portugal 3-1.

Investing in the younger levels of the national team has already delivered gainful returns. Hayes has spoken at length this year about utilizing the under-23 team as a developmental pathway for players in that age group, and she's not hesitated to send those who've already gained senior caps to the younger team for more experience.

Shaw had 26 national team caps and eight goals under her belt when she was named in two consecutive under-23 squads between May and July. She returned to the senior team in October for the Portugal friendlies and scored her first national team goal this year against Italy on Monday.

“Having those conversations with Emma, her being extremely transparent with me about the 23s program, what that's going to look like moving forward for me, and how I can continue to go back and forth just depending on what the camp looks like, is something that's going to help me in the future and to come up big in these moments as well,” Shaw said after the match.

Folding so many new players into the team took place alongside returns of veterans like striker Catarina Macario, midfielder Rose Lavelle, and center-back Naomi Girma from their respective injuries.

When healthy, they zip the squad together through the middle, demonstrated in part by Macario's team-leading eight goals this year, three of which were against Italy across the two legs. Monday saw the 26-year-old receive an impeccably timed pass by Yohannes down the flank and carry the ball into the box before calmly lofting it over Italian goalkeeper Francesca Durante and into the side netting. Hayes said the goal conjured tears of pride.

“That's the best level I've seen her since her injury,” she said. “That's what I was celebrating, she's got a little swagger back and that matters to her, not to me, because I always think she puts in great performances. But I saw that there really is another level to her to go — in her words, not mine.”

The UWSNT will not begin 2026 with an empty to-do list. By the time Hayes sat for the post-game press conference, her coaching staff had already informed the team's backline that they'd won just 25 percent of their aerial duels that night, an “unacceptable” figure by their standards.

And with the expected returns of players like Trinity Rodman, who was not called up due to injury, and Sophia Wilson, who has been on maternity leave this year, competition for a place on the 2027 World Cup roster will stiffen further, offering a different kind of heat to simmer in.

It is all part of Hayes' long-term recipe for the program.

Brentford have a remarkable record when it comes to replacing their star players. Over the last six years, the Bees have continued to progress despite seeing the likes of Ezri Konsa, Ollie Watkins, Said Benrahma, Neal Maupay, David Raya and Ivan Toney all move on, thanks to the meticulous work of the club's recruitment department. Their latest success story is Brazilian powerhouse Igor Thiago, who has emerged as a genuine rival to Erling Haaland for the Premier League's Golden Boot during the first half of the 2025-26 campaign.

Many tipped Brentford to be fighting a relegation battle after the summer departures of talismanic attacking duo Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa, club captain Christian Norgaard and beloved manager Thomas Frank. Keith Andrews made the step up from set-piece coach to succeed Frank, and was deemed to be lacking the necessary experience and squad depth to keep the team competitive at the highest level.

But Andrews has defied his doubters by embracing the same direct style of play as Frank and placing his trust in Thiago to lead the line. The 24-year-old has netted 11 goals in 13 Premier League games - just three shy of Haaland's tally in Manchester City colours - to propel Brentford back into the top half of the table as he almost single-handedly plugs the gap left by Mbeumo and Wissa.

Aston Villa, Tottenham and Newcastle are all now reportedly interested in signing Thiago, and talk of a maiden Brazil call-up is growing with each passing game. He could even jump to the front of his country's No.9 queue ahead of the 2026 World Cup if he can deal a major blow to Arsenal's title hopes when Brentford make the short trip to the Emirates on Wednesday.

Thiago grew up in Gama, Brazil, but didn't immediately pick up the football bug. “I was eight or nine when I started playing,” he recently told Brentford's official website. “I gradually started to gain the love of football. It mostly was my brother taking me at the weekend to games. I then saw Cristiano Ronaldo playing for Manchester United and that was the biggest thing. I saw Ronaldo playing and I said, ‘I want to be like him'."

He started honing his skills at local club Vere FC, but Thiago's journey towards the professional game was put on hold after he tragically lost his father aged just 13. He would go on to work as a grocery carrier and bricklayer to support his mother, which shaped his strong character: "It helped me as a man, and it helped me as person. It helped me to appreciate the little and big things in life, because today I look at my life and see that I'm privileged with everything I have."

Cruzeiro eventually handed Thiago his big break as an 18-year-old, and he scored 10 goals in 64 appearances for the club, attracting attention from Europe in the process. Bulgarian outfit Ludogorets snapped him up in March 2022, and he quickly adapted to life on a new continent.

Thiago notched a combined 32 goals and assists as Ludogorets claimed successive league titles, along with the Bulgarian Cup and Supercup. By the summer of 2023, Thiago had outgrown Ludogorets, and they sold him to Club Brugge for €8 million - a Parva Liga record fee.

Thiago repaid Brugge's investment tenfold in his first and only campaign in Belgium. He scored 29 goals in 55 appearances across all competitions in 2023-24, with 18 of those coming in a prolific run through December and January, as Brugge clinched the Pro League crown and reached the semi-finals of the Conference League.

The Brazilian picked up the Young Player of the Season award in the latter competition, with former Brugge boss Ronny Deila left delighted by his impact: "Thiago brings something to the team we didn't have before. Defenders hate playing against him. He presses non-stop, runs all the time and kicks them. Apart from that, he's also a top bloke, both on the pitch and in the dressing room. He should be capable of playing for a top outfit."

Brentford gave Thiago the chance to make good on that billing when breaking their transfer record to bring him to the Gtech Community Stadium that summer in a £30m ($40m) deal. Frank described it as a "proactive" move from the club after resigning himself to the exit of Toney, adding: "Thiago is a very exciting striker who fits the role in our team. He is hard-working and a very good pressing player. He is also a physical presence, very good in the box and can link the play. There is big potential."

Unfortunately, a cruel injury blow would prevent Thiago from unlocking that potential in what turned out to be a testing start to his life in England.

In his very first game for Brentford, a 5-2 pre-season win over AFC Wimbledon, Thiago suffered a meniscus injury, and immediately went under the knife. He was forced to sit out Brentford's first 11 Premier League games of 2024-25 as a result, eventually making his competitive debut in a 0-0 draw with Everton on November 23.

The Cruziero academy graduate featured from the bench again in subsequent outings against Leicester City and Aston Villa before impressing on his first start as Brentford beat Newcastle 4-2 at the Gtech. He was then sidelined again, however, after picking up an infection in his knee, much to the frustration of Frank.

"The risk of getting a joint infection is very, very small, but apparently it's the opposite when you are a Brentford player; instead of a two per cent chance it's a 98 per cent chance," said the Bees boss.

Thiago did not return until early May, and was only fit enough to make cameo appearances in Brentford's final four league fixtures. From the outside, it looked like a case of a dream transfer turning into a nightmare, but remarkably, Thiago was able to find enough positives that made him confident about his future.

"It was a big learning season for me, learning my body and how everything reacts. It was a hard season in terms of not being able to play, but a good season for learning how my body works," he said. "I thought moving to England would be harder than it was, to be honest, but everything went well."

Thiago scored the first goal of the Andrews era in a pre-season clash with Gil Vicente, and finally opened his competitive account in Brentford's opening game of the new Premier League campaign, converting a penalty in a 3-1 defeat at Nottingham Forest. He doubled his tally in a 2-1 reversal at newly-promoted Sunderland, powering a header in off the bar after stealing in between two defenders to meet a Frank Onyeka cross, but Brentford were languishing down in 17th towards the end of September with only four points amassed from a possible 15.

The tide turned, though, when Andrews' side welcomed Manchester United to the Gtech. Brentford pulled off a thrilling 3-1 upset, and Thiago was the star of the show. He rifled a thunderbolt of a half-volley into the top corner to open the scoring before making it 2-0 with a reactive close-range finish inside the first 20 minutes, while excelling throughout the contest with his skills as a target man, bullying the United defence into submission.

Since then, Thiago has been an unstoppable force of nature. He also scored the winning goal against Liverpool in October, and bagged two more braces in victories over Newcastle and Burnley. Even when on the periphery of games, the towering striker always poses a huge threat, as the Clarets learned to their peril on Saturday. Thiago came to life in the final 10 minutes of the match, first dispatching another penalty before smashing in the all-important second goal from a Jordan Henderson delivery, albeit with the aid of a deflection.

Thiago has built up a good relationship with Henderson, as well as fellow attackers Dango Ouattara and Kevin Schade, which is reaping great rewards for the Bees. He is clinical when he gets a sight of goal, both on the ground and in the air, but is also a selfless centre-forward who looks to bring others into play at every opportunity.

"Everything we stand for can be seen in abundance in Thiago," Andrews said after the Burnley win. "I just love the way he plays the game."

Thiago has scored more penalties than any other player in the Premier League this term (five), but is also third for goals from open play behind Haaland and Brighton's Danny Welbeck. The statistics suggest his incredible form will continue, too, because he ranks second for shots on target (19). 

Incredibly, Brentford's new talisman, who now boasts his own fan chant based on Spandau Ballet's iconic track 'Gold', is only four goals away from equalling the record for the most goals scored by a Brazilian in a single Premier League campaign, which is currently shared by Roberto Firmino, Gabriel Martinelli and Matheus Cunha (15). It would be a huge shock if Thiago doesn't surpass that mark given Brentford still have 25 games left to play, and it probably won't be long before he is rubbing shoulders with Martinelli and Cunha in the national team, either. Indeed, Andrews has already confirmed that Brazil head coach Carlo Ancelotti has been in touch to discuss Thiago's progress.

"He's a joy to coach and be around. He savours every second he's on the grass and in the games he's a real competitor. There's been contact from Brazil," Andrews revealed last week. "They're very aware of his qualities and it's a big dream for him. So hopefully we can work together to one day make that happen."

Ancelotti is blessed with strength in depth upfront that few other countries can match. Alongside Cunha and Martinelli, household names such as Vinicius Jr, Raphinha and Rodrygo are all competing for minutes, along with Chelsea wonderkid Estevao, while injury-plagued legend Neymar has an outside chance of making the World Cup squad if he can prove his fitness at Santos in the coming months.

That does not mean that Thiago's dream is unrealistic, though. The battle for the role of Brazil's first-choice striker is wide open, with Richarlison and Joao Pedro still struggling for consistency at Tottenham and Chelsea, respectively, and former Botafogo man Igor Jesus yet to find his feet at Nottingham Forest.

Ancelotti could opt to play with a false nine next summer, but as it stands, Thiago may be his best option. Brazil can turn on 'Joga Bonito' mode and blow away the lesser teams at the newly-expanded tournament, but against the more well-drilled sides, Thiago's presence could make the difference. When the ball goes up to him, it sticks, and he rarely makes the wrong decision.

His spatial awareness is an unsung aspect of his game, too. Thiago knows instinctively when and where to make penetrative runs. With a host of world-class players providing service, he could run riot in North America. Of course, it's impossible to say how Thiago would cope with the step up to the most prestigious stage in football and the pressure it brings, but he's exceeded expectations throughout his career, driven by unbreakable self-belief.

“It's my biggest goal,” Thiago affirmed when quizzed on a potential Brazil call-up. “When I reach there, which I will, it'll mean I've made it.” With that elite mentality, anything is possible.

The Selecao's all-time leading goalscorer is in for another lengthy spell on the sidelines.


Brazilian football has been rocked to its core once again, as Neymar's future has taken another dramatic downturn at the very moment he desperately needed some stability. Persistent fitness setbacks have stopped him from finding any rhythm since returning to Santos, and on the international front, he hasn't pulled on the Brazil shirt since October 2023 when an ACL injury derailed his momentum.

His emotional return to Brazil has not gone the way he or the fans imagined, as injuries keep derailing the comeback story for the former Barcelona superstar. The latest setback, a meniscus problem, was meant to sideline him for the rest of the year.

But with Santos sitting 17th and staring relegation in the face with only three games left, the 33-year-old threw medical advice out the window. He chose to play through the pain, fully aware that he was gambling with his future. The risk paid off on the night. Neymar scored and created another in a 3–0 victory that lifted Santos out of the drop zone, at least temporarily.

Reports in Brazil later suggested that the injury was even worse than first feared, with a tear in the meniscus of his left knee. The recommended solution was arthroscopic surgery, but the operation would have ruled him out for roughly a month and brought his season to an early end. Rather than undergo treatment and strengthen his case for a World Cup call-up, Neymar opted to keep training and competing for Santos, putting even more strain on an already delicate knee.

But what is a meniscus injury & how long does recovery take? As GOAL finds out...

A torn meniscus happens when the strong cartilage inside the knee gives way. Wedged between the femur and tibia are two pads of cartilage known as the meniscus, and they act like shock absorbers, softening the impact every time the knee bends or turns. A sharp twist, sudden pivot, or awkward rotation can be all it takes to rip that cartilage.

As the years go by, that cushioning naturally wears down and loses strength, making it much more vulnerable to damage. Arthritis, which gradually breaks down cartilage in the joints, can also set the stage for a tear. It's no surprise that this is one of the most frequent injuries seen in sports, especially among athletes who push their knees through constant cutting, sprinting and turning. Athletes in sports that demand sharp twists and quick changes of direction, think tennis, football, basketball or soccer, sit right at the top of the risk chart for a meniscus tear. 

The danger only jumps higher in full-contact games, where a heavy collision or tackle can force the knee into an awkward turn and shred the cartilage. And just to be clear, it's not only the high-intensity players who suffer. Over time, the meniscus can simply wear down from years of use, which means anyone can pick up a degenerative tear regardless of how active they are.

Walking/playing on a torn meniscus is technically possible at first, since many people can still stand and apply weight right after the injury. But that window closes fast. Within a day or two the knee typically swells up like a balloon, the pain spikes, and suddenly even a simple step feels like a battle.

Even banged up, Neymar is still dragging Santos forward almost single-handedly. Playing through pain in his left knee, the Brazilian icon turned in a match-winning display in Friday's vital 3-0 win over Sport Recife, a result that hauled the club out of the relegation zone, at least for the moment. With two matches left to be played in the Brazilian Serie A, Santos is still fighting for survival.

Recovery from a torn meniscus isn't the same for everyone. The timeline really depends on how serious the tear is and how quickly the body responds to rehab. For those who undergo surgery, the road back typically ranges from about three to eight weeks of focused recovery work.

There's always the urge to jump straight back into running, jumping, and all the old habits, but rushing the process is a recipe for another setback. Before anyone even thinks about returning to full-speed training or competition, a few boxes need to be checked:

For most people, getting back to 100 percent can take anywhere from six weeks to a few months. By the four-month mark after surgery, many are back to living normally and easing into more demanding activities, including sports. But timelines aren't universal. Those returning to high-impact competitions like basketball or soccer often need more time to ensure the knee can handle the intensity.

Since taking the reins of the Brazilian national team, Carlo Ancelotti has yet to summon Neymar, and the omission has split opinions across the football world. Ancelotti has stood firm on his stance, stressing that his squad must be built around players who are healthy, in rhythm, and competing week in and week out.

This latest injury twist only muddies the waters further. The debate is no longer simply about whether Neymar can get back to full fitness in time. The real dilemma now is whether Ancelotti will be willing to gamble on a star who hasn't enjoyed a steady run of games in months and whose injury history seems to grow longer every season.

He stressed that the issue has never been about Neymar's ability, making it clear in his recent interview: "I think he has great talent. He was unlucky to get injured during the time we were together. He couldn't prepare himself to be in good physical shape because of the injuries. We are in November..." The coach then doubled down on his respect for the forward, adding, "Neymar is on the same level as the others, considering that Neymar has already shown extraordinary talent."

The 2026 World Cup is set to kick off on Thursday, June 11, 2026, signaling the tournament's long-awaited return to its classic June-July window. The showpiece will run through the summer before wrapping up with the final on July 19.

It's a contrast to the 2022 World Cup, which broke tradition by shifting to the northern hemisphere's winter. That switch was made to dodge the extreme summer heat in Qatar, where scorching June and July temperatures were deemed too dangerous for both players and fans.

The group classification of the 48 teams at next year's World Cup finals will be determined at the FIFA draw in the US.

The FIFA World Cup draw is an event that comes around only once every four years – but it can do plenty to determine a football nation's morale heading into the sport's most prestigious global competition.

The 2026 tournament – to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico – features a record 48 teams, with this draw adding a few new tweaks to spread out the contenders from the pretenders.

Here is all you need to know before the all-important little plastic balls are allocated to their pots:

The draw will begin at the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, on Friday, December 5, at 12 noon (17:00 GMT).

The draw will begin with Pot 1 and the 12 seeded teams, as determined by FIFA, being drawn into Groups A to L. These teams comprise:

The process will then continue with Pots 2, 3, and 4, in that order, FIFA explained.

Six more World Cup spots remain to be filled among the 22 nations still in contention through the playoffs in March.

Italy, four-time World Cup winners and 12th in the FIFA rankings, are in the playoffs and could find themselves in Pot 4 if they qualify.

Debutants Uzbekistan are in Pot 3, while fellow first-timers Jordan, Cape Verde and Curacao are in Pot 4.

Each nation's name is printed on a slip of paper, which is then folded and placed inside a plastic ball numbered 1 to 4 to represent one of the four pots.

Draw representatives mix up the balls in large glass bowls (pots) – and then extract one ball at a time from each pot to form the groups.

The three host nations have predetermined groups: Mexico in Group A, Canada in Group B, and USA in Group D.

The other top nine FIFA-seeded nations will be spread across the remaining nine groups: C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, and L.

There is less certainty for the remaining 36 teams, but specific rules do apply:

The 2026 World Cup draw rewards the four highest-ranked teams – Spain, Argentina, France and England – who will be placed in separate sections, or quadrants, of a new tennis-style seeded tournament bracket.

FIFA said the top four nations, if they finish top of their respective round-robin groups, will avoid each other until the semifinals.

Defending champions Argentina (No 2 ranked) with Lionel Messi and top-ranked European champions Spain (No 1 ranked) with Lamine Yamal, therefore, can ensure they do not meet until the final at MetLife Stadium near New York.

Forty-two of the 48 teams have now qualified for the World Cup, with the remaining six nations to be determined in March 2026.

Teams will be randomly drawn from each of the four pots and assigned to one of the 12 groups in Friday's draw:

Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (three host nations and nine top-seeded)

Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia

Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Uzbekistan, Qatar, South Africa

Pot 4: Jordan, Cape Verde, Ghana, Curacao, Haiti, New Zealand, European playoff winners A, B, C and D, Intercontinental playoff winners 1 and 2

 



 

Iran has decided to boycott the World Cup draw because the US denied visas to members of its delegation, the state-run IRNA news agency reported on Friday.

The agency quoted Iranian football federation spokesman Amir-Mahdi Alavi as saying that officials faced visa obstacles that go beyond sporting considerations.

There was no immediate comment from the White House.

Alavi said the federation had reached out to FIFA and hoped it could help resolve the issue.

President Donald Trump's administration announced in June a travel ban on citizens from 12 countries, including Iran, although exemptions were promised for “any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the secretary of state”.

It is unclear whether the exemptions also apply to the World Cup draw.

Live coverage of the 2026 World Cup draw will be provided on FIFA.com and the FIFA World Cup social media channels. The draw will also be broadcast by FIFA's media partners.

Al Jazeera Sport will provide live text commentary of the draw.

It's hard to overstate the degree to which Chloe Kelly captured the attention of a nation this past summer. Her pivotal performances in the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final of the 2025 European Championship helped drive England on to a second successive continental crown while also catapulting her name into the limelight like never before, even surpassing the levels achieved after her extra-time goal won Euro 2022. Yet, fans tuning into the Women's Super League this season hoping to see Kelly's magic in action for Arsenal, will have been disappointed.

With nine WSL games and four Champions League outings on the board, only four players in the Gunners' squad have accrued fewer minutes across all competitions than Kelly, who has started just three times since the season kicked-off in early September. Given she not only shone for England in the summer, but also made her move to Arsenal permanent off the back of an exciting loan spell in the first half of 2025, it's certainly not been what most expected.

In just a few weeks, Kelly will head to the ceremony for the prestigious BBC Sports Personality of the Year award as the second-favourite to win, only marginally behind golfer Rory McIlroy, who completed the career grand slam earlier this year by triumphing at the Masters in dramatic fashion. But as her impact at Euro 2025 continues to be celebrated, can Kelly find the magic needed to spark her season into life?

It's been a weird start to this season for Kelly. The 27-year-old started Arsenal's first game of the season, against London City Lionesses, missed the next outing at West Ham due to a knock and would sport visible strapping on her right knee from there on out, up until early November, as she clearly nursed some sort of issue.

Yet, the West Ham game would be the only one she'd miss, with a start against European giants Lyon even coming in early October despite Kelly not looking fully fit at times. Indeed, in that clash with the French champions, the England winger struggled massively to get involved in attack and didn't help out enough in defence before being withdrawn before the hour. Until Arsenal's final game before this international break, the rest of her appearances for the club so far this term have come as a substitute.

While it's easy to say that Renee Slegers, the Arsenal boss, could've maybe just coped without Kelly for a few weeks while she got over the issue plaguing her, the player is always going to want to play, especially given the increased competition for places in the Gunners' wide areas this season following Olivia Smith's record-breaking arrival from Liverpool.

Plus, despite not being at 100 per cent, Kelly has still provided some special moments. She was on the scoresheet against former club Manchester City in early October, albeit in an eventual 3-2 defeat, and has reminded everyone of the wonderful service she can provide in the Champions League. Her quick-thinking assist for Alessia Russo in the win over Benfica was brilliant while it was her wicked cross that the England No.9 tucked away to level the scores on Arsenal's way to victory over Real Madrid just recently.

Fortunately, that period of managing an injury seems to be behind Kelly now. Asked about the winger when she was called up by England for this ongoing camp, Slegers clarified the situation with regards to her fitness. "She missed the West Ham game and a couple of training sessions but since then she's been building back, and some things take a little bit longer than others, but she's fully fit," she explained.

That was underlined by Slegers' team selection just before the international break, as she handed Kelly just her third start of the season against Real Madrid. The winger justified her inclusion in the XI, too. After having a significant impact in the clash with Las Blancas in last year's Champions League quarter-final, playing a key role in the Gunners' historic comeback win, Kelly was effective again in this rematch, delivering that great cross for Russo to head home and get the European champions back into things.

It was the highlight of a performance in which Kelly, free of that strapping on her knee, generally looked back to full fitness and sharpness, too, standing out as one of Arsenal's best players on the night.

It feels like Kelly's season can really start now then. After all, we're talking about a player who lit up Euro 2025 despite not starting any of England's six games, sparking the Lionesses' into life right when they needed it. It was Kelly's brilliant delivery that allowed Lucy Bronze to get England back into a quarter-final they seemed well out of, it was her goal that defeated Italy in the next round and sent the Lionesses through to the final, and it was her spot-kick that defeated Spain to win the trophy. She didn't do it all alone, of course, but she played a massive role.

That quality was on show for Arsenal in the second half of last season, too. Having secured a loan move to north London, freeing her from a situation at Manchester City where she was totally out of favour, Kelly starred as the Gunners enjoyed much-improved form under Slegers and won the Champions League. There's no doubting her status as one of the best wingers in England, and Europe, when she is fit and firing. Now that she is getting back to the latter, she can show that.

England's win over China on Saturday, by a record-breaking 8-0 scoreline, felt like a timely reminder of the need for Kelly to deliver, too, as the Lionesses enter a new cycle that features the 2027 Women's World Cup. As Beth Mead lit up Wembley Stadium with a quickfire brace, Lauren Hemp scored on her return from injury and Jess Park entered the game as a lively winger, following a positional change at Manchester United, the Lionesses' competition for places in the wide areas was underlined. This was also all without Lauren James, who made her first appearance of the season for Chelsea last month after overcoming a foot problem.

Kelly has similar competition at Arsenal as well, where she can count Mead, Smith and Australia forward Caitlin Foord as team-mates, as well as the versatile Mariona Caldentey. In order to get minutes for club and country, and assert herself as a key player for both, Kelly has to show that ability which has made her so talismanic so regularly. If not, there are others that can.

Having seemingly overcome the issue that hampered her in the first few months of the season, Kelly should get those opportunities to remind everyone what she can do in the latter stages of this year. Between the WSL, Champions League and the knockout stages of the League Cup beginning, Arsenal have plenty of games before the winter break, and Kelly's return to full sharpness could be exactly what they need to get out of the funk they find themselves in, having won just one of their last four games.

Sarina Wiegman, meanwhile, may look at Tuesday's clash with Ghana as a chance to help reignite the player who was so crucial to success at Euro 2025. World Cup qualifying will begin in the New Year and the Lionesses have a tough assignment, needing to pip Spain to top spot in their group to secure automatic qualification for the tournament in Brazil.

Achieving as much will be made easier if England can turn to an in-form Kelly, a player who has delivered game-changing and title-winning moments aplenty in her career to date. But to get to that point, she needs to start racking up the game time again. She'll hope that starts on Tuesday and only continues through to the end of a 2025 which has been monumental and, with the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award to be dished out just before Christmas, could well get even better yet.

Ahead of the FIFA World
Cup 2026 draw on Friday 5 December, the Opta supercomputer has
produced its early predictions for this summer's tournament in
North America. Here are the
results.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw takes place in Washington D.C. on 5
December, allowing fans of all nations to start plotting their
routes to a possible coronation at New Jersey's MetLife
Stadium.

Sixteen venues across the United States, Canada and Mexico will
play host to the biggest-ever edition of the tournament, with the
number of teams increasing from 32 and 48 and the tally of games
upped from 64 to 104.

Six of the teams appearing at the tournament are still to be
decided, with four qualifying via the UEFA play-offs and another
two via the inter-confederation playoffs.

But most of the favourites are set, with Lionel Messi hoping to
help Argentina become the first team since Brazil in 1962 to
successfully defend their crown.

Argentina, though, will face fierce competition, not least from
2022 runners-up France and reigning European champions Spain.

England and Brazil, meanwhile, will hope the appointments of
Thomas Tuchel and Carlo Ancelotti prove inspired decisions.

Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal should not be discounted, while the
three host nations will be desperate to make their mark.

And what of a Norway team spearheaded by Manchester City goal
machine Erling Haaland?

Ahead of this week's draw, we have taken a deep dive into the
Opta supercomputer's first set of World Cup predictions to assess
who is most likely to lift the trophy.

At Euro 2024, Luis de la Fuente's Spain produced one of the most
eye-catching international tournament successes in recent
memory.

La Roja swept all before them, winning six of their seven
matches inside 90 minutes and only requiring extra-time to
eliminate hosts Germany in the quarter-final. They scored 15 goals
in the tournament – four more than anyone else.

And there has been no downturn from De la Fuente's side since.
Spain are now unbeaten in their last 31 competitive games (W25 D6,
excluding penalty shootouts), beating the famous 30-match run they
enjoyed under Vicente del Bosque between 2010 and 2013 – a streak
that saw them win both the World Cup and the Euros.

By the time the next international break comes around in March,
it'll be three years since Spain last lost a competitive match.
That defeat came away at Scotland on 28 March 2023 in a Euro 2024
qualifier (2-0).

It is little surprise, then, that Spain are our predictive
model's early World Cup favourites, going all the way in 17.0% of
tournament predictions.

If Spain are to triumph, it is likely Lamine Yamal will play a
key role. Their Euro 2024 triumph came the day after Yamal's 17th
birthday, as he replaced Pelé (1958, 17 years, 249 days) as the
youngest player to feature in a World Cup or European Championship
final.

Yamal created the most chances at the tournament, with 19, while
only teammate Nico Williams (2.1) had more expected assists (xA)
than his 2.0.

Spain will be closely monitoring the progress of Rodri, with the
midfielder playing just 294 minutes in the Premier League for Man
City since tearing his anterior cruciate ligament last year.
Barcelona duo Pedri and Gavi will also look to prove their fitness
after injury-disrupted starts to 2025-26.

But if their key players enter the tournament in good health,
Spain will be supremely confident of repeating their feat from
2008-12 of holding the Euros and World Cup trophies at the same
time.

The 2026 World Cup will mark the end of an era in French
football, with Didier Deschamps set to stand down from his role as
Les Bleus' head coach after 14 years at the helm. He will hope to
go out with a bang and cement his legacy as France's greatest
boss.

Deschamps' reign has comprised 175 games, so if they reach the
first knockout round, he will have overseen 100 games more than
France's next-longest serving boss (Raymond Domenech, 79).

After watching his team fall agonisingly short on penalties
against Argentina in Qatar, he has another chance to become only
the second coach to win multiple World Cups (after Vittorio Pozzo
in 1934 and 1938).

Deschamps also lifted the trophy as a player when he was captain
in 1998 and this will be Kylian Mbappé's first World Cup as France
skipper.

The Real Madrid sensation will be targeting individual and team
records.

Mbappé is closing in on Olivier Giroud's mark of 57 goals for
France, having netted 55 times in his 93 caps. There is a good
chance that record falls before the World Cup, but he is also
chasing down Miroslav
Klose's all-time total of 16 goals at World Cups, having netted
12 times in just two editions of the tournament (four in 2018,
eight in 2022).

Messi (13) is one goal ahead of Mbappé, who will surely take
possession of the record eventually. But the prospect of two icons
duelling to end the tournament in the lead should be absorbing
viewing.

France also boast the player recently crowned the world's best,
and it is not Mbappé. Ousmane Dembélé won the 2025 Ballon d'Or
after spearheading Paris Saint-Germain's run to a first UEFA
Champions League crown, scoring 33 goals and recording 13 assists
in 2024-25 from a central attacking role.

Finding a way to get Mbappé and Dembélé to function in the same
attack will be one of the major conundrums facing Deschamps.

With a 14.1% chance, France are the supercomputer's second
favourites, just behind Spain, who beat them 5-4 in the semi-finals
of the UEFA Nations League in June.

The only one other team assigned more than a one-in-10 chance of
becoming world champions is England, who are out to end 60 years of
hurt at major tournaments.

The Three Lions enter their first – and potentially only –
tournament under Tuchel as third favourites with a 11.8%
probability of lifting the trophy, having come up short in two
European Championship finals under Gareth Southgate.

Tuchel's task is simple – get international football's nearly
men over the line. He could become only the third manager to win
both the UEFA Champions League and the World Cup, after Marcello
Lippi (Juventus, Italy) and Del Bosque (Real Madrid, Spain).

His England reign took some time to get going, as England
laboured past Albania (3-0), Latvia (2-0), Andorra (1-0 and 2-0)
and were beaten 3-1 by Senegal in a June friendly.

But a rampant 5-0 victory in Serbia in September showcased the
Three Lions' potential, and the emergence of Elliot Anderson seems
to have finally ended their search for a central midfield partner
for Declan Rice.

England ultimately finished Group K with eight wins – and eight
clean sheets – from as many matches, becoming only the second team
to win all their games in a UEFA World Cup qualifying campaign
without conceding after Yugoslavia in 1954.

Southgate's England teams were also solid at the back but rarely
free-flowing. At Euro 2024, they recorded just 5.4 xG – Turkey,
Austria and Switzerland were among the teams to better that
tally.

So, Tuchel is also expected to provide better entertainment, and
he certainly has the tools to do so, with a stunning array of
options to choose from, particularly in the attacking midfield
positions.

There should be plenty of service for Harry Kane, who is
Europe's most in-form striker, netting 24 goals in 20 matches for
Bayern Munich since the start of the season in August. But there is
a competitive race for the positions behind the England skipper
after Tuchel suggested Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden could not
both start, while Cole Palmer's season has barely got going due to
injuries.

Given the way England often toiled at Euro 2024, Tuchel's
refusal to crowbar in the big names could come as a breath of fresh
air, and the likes of Eberechi Eze and Morgan Rogers are staking
impressive claims.

In the eyes of Argentina's supporters, Messi struggled to emerge
from Diego Maradona's shadow until the 2022 World Cup.

But the Barcelona legend produced one of the greatest individual
World Cup campaigns, scoring seven goals and assisting three, while
becoming the first player to ever net in the group stage, last 16,
quarter-finals, semi-finals and final of a single edition.

Messi also led all players in Qatar for shots (32), chances
created from open play (17) and fouls won (22), becoming the
second player to top all three metrics at a single World Cup. The
other? Maradona in 1986 (30 shots, 19 open-play chances created, 53
fouls won).

Now, he gets the opportunity to do something even Maradona could
not accomplish – win a second World Cup.

Messi has shown no signs of slowing down, helping Inter Miami
reach the Major League Soccer Cup final while contributing a
staggering 35 goals and providing 21 assists in MLS action this
year.

The attacker 
already leads all players for appearances (26) and goal
involvements (21, since assists were first recorded in 1966) at
World Cups, while Messi's battle to break Klose's goal record
before Mbappé is an enthralling additional storyline.

Argentina dominated the CONMEBOL World Cup qualification group,
finishing nine points clear of second-placed Ecuador, and last year
they also retained the Copa América for the first time since
1993.

A lack of recent match practice against top-class European
opponents could count against the Albiceleste, who also saw Ángel
Di María retire from international football after the Copa
América.

But the likes of Enzo Fernández and Julián Alvarez have kicked
on in the last two years, and any team which has Messi has a chance
of going all the way – a creditable 8.7% chance, according to the
supercomputer.

Germany are the supercomputer's fifth favourites with a 7.1%
chance of winning a record-equalling fifth World Cup.

But by the time next year's tournament rolls around, it will
have been 12 years since Germany played a knockout game at a World
Cup. That was when they beat Argentina in the 2014 final.

Julian Nagelsmann's side were beaten in the quarter-finals on
home soil at Euro 2024, marking the first time Germany have
appeared at four major tournaments (World Cup/Euros) in a row
without reaching a semi-final at any of them.

Their route to this World Cup was not completely smooth, either,
as they were left needing victory over Slovakia in their final
Group A game to avoid the play-offs. But they won that match by a
statement 6-0 scoreline, with Nick Woltemade, Serge Gnabry and
Leroy Sané among the goals.

Germany arguably played some of the best football at Euro 2024,
ranking second for average possession (62.5%) and goals scored
(11), but Nagelsmann has plenty of selection dilemmas to
consider.

Marc-André ter Stegen has lost his place as Barcelona's
first-choice goalkeeper after undergoing back surgery, while
Nagelsmann has tested multiple midfield pairings since Toni Kroos'
retirement – Aleksandar Pavlović partnered Leon Goretzka in the
final two qualifiers.

Germany have at least scraped into Pot 1 for the group-stage
draw, taking the 12th and final spot among the top seeds, ahead of
Croatia, and despite question marks it would be rash not to
consider them as contenders at this stage.

When Cristiano Ronaldo swapped Manchester United for Al-Nassr
after the 2022 World Cup, some may have expected it to be a case
of, ‘out of sight, out of mind'.

But the five-time Ballon d'Or winner simply cannot stop making
headlines, with FIFA recently announcing Ronaldo would not serve
the typical three-match ban following his red card in Portugal's
defeat to the Republic of Ireland, freeing him up to play their
World Cup opener.

And after Messi finally ended his wait for a World Cup win in
Qatar, Portugal are assigned a 6.6% chance of giving Ronaldo his
own crowning moment.

Portugal boast, on paper, one of the most talented squads at the
tournament. Vitinha, João Neves and Nuno Mendes all enjoyed
spectacular 2024-25 campaigns with PSG, while EPL stars Rúben Dias,
Bernardo Silva and Bruno Fernandes make up a technically-gifted and
highly-experienced spine.

But when the tournament begins, the likelihood is that Ronaldo
will hog the headlines, just as he did in Qatar in 2022 and at Euro
2024. At the former tournament, Ronaldo was dropped for a last-16
tie against Switzerland after a series of ineffective displays, and
his replacement Gonçalo Ramos scored a hat-trick in a 6-1 win.

Then, in Germany, Ronaldo broke down in tears after seeing a
penalty saved in Portugal's last-16 tie against Slovenia, which
they eventually won on spot-kicks.

Portugal went out to France at the next stage, as Ronaldo ended
the tournament without a goal from 23 shots and 3.6 xG – the
second-highest tally at the competition.

Like Messi, 
Ronaldo will appear at a record-breaking sixth edition of the World
Cup, but of his eight goals in 22 games at the tournament,
three have been penalties and none have come in the knockout
stages.

However, this year's Nations League triumph offers significant
hope that Roberto Martínez can get the balance right even while
accommodating the 40-year-old, who is still full of confidence
after scoring 84 goals in 86 Saudi Pro League games.

Fans have learned to never write Ronaldo off, and however
Portugal's campaign goes, it is unlikely to be dull.

Brazil are the only side to qualify for every edition of the
World Cup, though the Seleção cut things a little too fine this
time around, finishing fifth in CONMEBOL's qualifiers.

Ancelotti was only in charge for the final five games of their
campaign, but less than eight months into his reign, he has already
overseen surprise defeats to Bolivia and Japan, as well as poor
draws with Ecuador and Tunisia.

Next year, it will have
been 24 years since Brazil last lifted the World Cup. They have
only endured one previous drought of that length since first
winning the tournament in 1958, between 1970 and 1994.

That previous dry spell ended, of course, in the United States,
and Brazil are assigned a 5.6% chance of another stateside
triumph.

If Brazil are to go all the way, Ancelotti must find a way to
get more out of Vinícius Júnior.

Vinícius has played under five different head coaches since
joining Real Madrid, and 149 of his 192 goal involvements for the
club came during Ancelotti's second spell in charge of Los
Blancos.

Estêvão's flying start to life with Chelsea gives Brazil another
electric option out wide, though it remains to be seen whether
Ancelotti will bow to pressure to recall Neymar – if he proves his
fitness – for his first appearance since 2023, amid the forward's
persistent injury issues.

Brazil have consistently underwhelmed in recent years, failing
to get past the last eight at the two most recent World Cups and
the 2024 Copa América, but if any manager can get them to perform
on the big stage in a knockout tournament, it's Ancelotti.

The Netherlands have reached the most World Cup finals without
ever lifting the trophy (three), and they are the eighth and final
team assigned more than a 5% chance of triumphing next year, at
5.2%.

The Oranje's run to the semi-finals of Euro 2024 – losing late
on to England – was their best at any tournament since finishing
third at the 2014 World Cup.

Their current side has a distinctly English influence, with four
Premier League players scoring in their final World Cup qualifier
versus Lithuania (4-0, Tijjani Reijnders, Cody Gakpo, Xavi Simons
and Donyell Malen) – the first time that has occurred for the
Netherlands.

Ronald Koeman has restored the traditional Dutch 4-3-3 system
and has been rewarded with some positive performances against elite
opponents.

One recurring issue in recent years has been their lack of a
true centre-forward. But Memphis Depay remains a talisman for his
nation, becoming their all-time leading scorer when he netted his
51st international goal in September.

The Netherlands may lack the star power of the other main
favourites and are slipping under the radar with many, but the
supercomputer thinks they are worthy of consideration.

France became the sixth team to win the World Cup as hosts in
1998, but no side has accomplished the feat since then.

Even the most ardent supporters of the United States, Mexico or
Canada would struggle to make the case for a home triumph in 2026,
but with a little luck in the draw, you never know.

Eleven of the tournament's venues are in the USA, and Mauricio
Pochettino's side are assigned a 0.9% chance of going all the way.
They will be placed in Group D, with two of their first-round games
taking place in Los Angeles and the other in Seattle.

The USMNT appointed Pochettino after of a humiliating
group-stage exit as Copa América hosts last year, and things did
not immediately improve as the Argentine lost five of his first 10
matches at the helm.

Pochettino's side did reach the final of the 2025 CONCACAF Gold
Cup, despite star names including Christian Pulisic, Weston
McKennie, Folarin Balogun and Antonee Robinson missing the
tournament.

Pochettino has had no choice but to experiment – in November,
Giovani Reyna's return to the squad saw him become the 51st player
to start a game for the USMNT in 2025.

Along with the Gold Cup run, a 5-1 win over Uruguay last time
out put Pochettino's critics on notice, and the USA should feel
good about their chances of being competitive in the knockout
stages.

Mexico, the team that defeated the USA in the Gold Cup final,
are the host nation viewed as most likely to shock the world and
lift the trophy, with a 1.3% probability.  

It remains to be seen how the introduction of a round of 32 will
affect El Tri, who lost in the round of 16 at seven consecutive
World Cups before suffering a group-stage exit in Qatar.

Javier Aguirre's team will play in the tournament's opening
match, in Mexico City on 11 June, but they failed to win any of
their final six games in 2025 (D3 L3) – all of them friendlies –
with five of those coming against teams lower than them in the FIFA
World Rankings.

There will likely be an experienced feel to their squad, led by
Fulham striker Raúl Jiménez, who is only eight away from Javier
Hernández's all-time Mexico goal record of 52.

But it remains to be seen whether 
40-year-old goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa will earn a historic
call-up. He is the third player – alongside Messi and Ronaldo –
able to appear at an unprecedented sixth edition of the World Cup
and was selected for the Gold Cup, so watch this space.

Canada are deemed the least likely of the host nations to go all
the way, winning the tournament in just 0.4% of our simulations,
though they are only a year removed from a historic tournament
run.

Mere weeks into Jesse Marsch's reign, Canada reached the
semi-finals on their Copa América debut, losing 2-0 to eventual
winners Argentina. Only a penalty shootout denied them a bronze
medal, as they lost to Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay in the third-place
play-off.

But a stunning defeat to Guatemala, in another shootout, ended
Canada's Gold Cup campaign at the quarter-final stage and brought
them crashing down to earth.

If Canada are to spring a surprise on home soil (their Group B
fixtures will all be played in Toronto or Vancouver), they will
need Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies to be in peak condition,
having been sidelined with an anterior cruciate ligament injury
since March.

In addition to the top eight favourites, there are two other
teams given at least a 2% chance of winning the World Cup –
Norway (2.3%) and Colombia
(2.0%).

Norway will be the team nobody wishes to draw from Pot 3, having
steamrolled their way through the UEFA qualifiers with a perfect
eight wins and 37 goals – the most of any team.  

Haaland struck 16 of those goals, matching Robert Lewandowski's
2018 record for the most prolific UEFA World Cup qualification
campaign. Lewandowski scored his tally in 10 games, two more than
Haaland.

Colombia also deserve their lofty status in our
projections, as they come in the tournament off the back of a run
to the final of the 2024 Copa América, having outscored all other
teams at that tournament with 12 goals.

The resurgence of James Rodríguez made headlines at that
competition, as he led the way for chances created (20) and assists
(six) – that latter tally equalled the record for a single edition,
alongside Brazil's Alex in 2003.

Those teams round out the top 10 favourites, with
Belgium next with a 1.9% probability. Many members
of the Red Devils' ‘Golden Generation' remain in the fold, even if
the years are starting to catch up with them.

Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, now teammates at Napoli, and
Thibaut Courtois will all feature at a fourth edition of the World
Cup – no player has ever represented Belgium at more (Enzo Scifo
also four).

This will be Rudi Garcia's first tournament in charge since
replacing Domenico Tedesco in January, and even if Belgium are no
longer the force they once were – they drew three of their eight
qualifiers and only finished two points ahead of Wales – they
remain a threat.

Croatia are another team whose best days may be
behind them but can never be ruled out. Semi-finalists in both 2018
and 2022, they are assigned a 1.1% chance of glory – lower than
Mexico and Uruguay (1.7%), whose coach Bielsa
recently went on a rant in a press conference following speculation
over his position.

Inspirational Croatia captain Luka Modrić is hoping to appear at
his fifth World Cup at the age of 40, and no team will want to see
Croatia drawn into their group from Pot 2.

Morocco (1.1%) and Ecuador
(1.0%) are the other teams with a greater than 1% chance of glory,
with Japan (0.9%) and USA just behind.

And of course, there are also six teams still to be decided in
March's play-offs. There is currently a combined 3.7% chance of any
of those sides going all the way, with Italy
surely the most likely candidates if they can end their World Cup
exile.

When the tournament begins, it will have been 20 years since the
Azzurri played a knockout match at the World Cup – with their most
recent such game being the 2006 final.

They must get past Northern Ireland and
potentially Wales to make it, with both of those
sides hoping to join fellow home nations England and
Scotland.

Appearing at their first World Cup since 1998, the Tartan Army
are given a 0.2% chance of lifting the trophy, level with the likes
of South Africa, Australia,
Iran and Tunisia.

Sweden (in 1958) and Czechia
(in 1934 and 1962) have both been World Cup finalists previously
(the latter as Czechoslovakia) but could still miss the tournament,
as could former European champions Denmark.

If previous World Cups are anything to go by, shocks and
surprises should be a given, so all those teams will still be
dreaming of a deep run.

With 48 teams taking part, there also will be some new names
gracing the tournament.

Debutants Uzbekistan are seen as having a
slightly better chance of impressing than the other new nations, as
they have a 0.2% chance of going all the way. A more realistic aim
might be getting through the groups after impressing in AFC
qualification – beating out sides like Qatar and United Arab
Emirates.

Cape Verde (0.1%) have qualified and are the
second-smallest nation by population (after Iceland in 2018) to
achieve the feat. They fared slightly better with our model than
the other first-timers Curaçao and
Jordan (both 0.04%).

Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Panama and New
Zealand all could be in for a difficult summer as they
have the same rating as Cape Verde (all 0.1%).

As things stand, the least likely nation to prevail after coming
out bottom in our simulations is Haiti (0.03%), who have qualified
for the first time since 1974, but it already looks clear there are
going to be some brilliant stories from top to bottom in next
year's tournament.

FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Catarina Macario scored in her third straight international match, and the United States women's national team defeated Italy, 2-0, on Monday night in their final game this year.

The United States has scored in 16 straight matches, including all 15 this year. The national team wrapped up 2025 with a 12-3-0 record. 

Macario scored the opening goal in the 20th minute with a strike from the corner of the box and up over Italy goalkeeper Francesca Durante's head and into the side netting of the far post.

Jaedyn Shaw added a second goal before halftime, taking a pass from Alyssa Thompson before squaring up and calmly finishing out of Durante's reach to make it 2-0.

Claudia Dickey earned her fifth clean sheet in her sixth appearance in goal for the United States.

Macario had a pair of goals in a 3-0 victory over Italy on Friday night in Orlando. Olivia Moultrie, who scored the other goal on Friday, was available off the bench Monday. 

“I really enjoyed the performances of these two games,” US coach Emma Hayes said, noting the contributions across the roster. “I think they're my favorite performances of the year.”

Macario, who plays for Chelsea, led the team this year with eight goals, including seven goals in her last seven starts. She nearly got a second goal at Ft. Lauderdale's Chase Stadium but it was disallowed because of a foul, denying her a third brace in her last three international games. 

Hayes celebrated Macario's goal on the sidelines, explaining how the forward had clearly regained her form after a series of unfortunate injuries over the past several years.

“That's what I was celebrating was, she's got a little swagger back and that matters to her, not to me, because I always think she puts in great performances. But I saw tonight that there really is another level to her to go,” Hayes said. “And I think I know she feels when she's in this environment she feels valued and seen and supported.”

Macario and Emily Fox were among the players named earlier Monday as nominees for the women's US Soccer Player of the Year award, joining Rose Lavelle, Alyssa Thompson, and Sam Coffey. 

Hayes made five changes to the starting lineup from Friday's victory in the first game against Italy, going with veterans Naomi Girma, Lindsey Heaps, Fox, and Macario. Three teenagers started for the United States, including 19-year-olds Claire Hutton and Jordyn Bugg, and 18-year-old Lily Yohannes. 

The US national team will next gather from Jan. 17-27 for the team's annual camp in Carson, Calif., with a match planned against Paraguay and another against an undetermined opponent.

“I'm so grateful because he's been super supportive pushing me through,” she said. “He's the one who believes in me most, even more than I do. That helps and that's very important for me, especially at this stage of my career.“After traveling so much with me and watching all this tennis, he's starting to understand it better but still, it's a different perspective from someone who grew up in the sport. Luckily, he's not coaching me anymore, so it's just nice to have his support.”

The Spaniard's three-set win in the pair's first meeting sparked the surge that ultimately took him back to No. 1.BySteve TignorPublished Dec 02, 2025 copy_link

This week, Steve Tignor will reveal his ATP Matches of the Year, and the TENNIS.com editors will reveal our ATP Players of the Year. The WTA editions will begin Monday, December 8.Carlos Alcaraz and Arthur Fils had played two fiercely fought sets, filled with blazing winners and lunging retrievals. Now Fils had reached the moment of truth, and he had the shot he wanted. One more clean forehand swing and he would serve for the match against the four-time Slam champ.It was the Monte Carlo quarterfinals. More important, it was the first meeting between the Spaniard and the Frenchman, who were 21 and 20, respectively, at the time. The showdown had been a long time coming, but it had been worth the wait. For 90-odd minutes, they'd thrown everything they had at each other. Full-swing forehands from one side were met by even bigger cuts from the other. Slugfest rallies at the baseline evolved into cat-and-mouse duels at the net.

He was eagerly awaiting whatever Alcaraz had in store, and looked, for a set and a half, like the better player. When push came to shove, it was Fils' reflexed returns and heavy forehands that prevailed. Alcaraz's customary grin was nowhere to be found. He looked stressed, by Fils and the French-centric crowd.Serving at 5-5 in the second set, Alcaraz seemed to buckle under Fils' pressure, going down 0-40. Two good points got him back to 30-40. With one more break chance, Fils slowly took control of a rally, running around to hit forehands and forcing Alcaraz to come up with short-hop backhands. Finally, Fils had a look at an inside-out forehand. He fired it toward the sideline; for a split-second, it looked like a winner. Then the electronic voice spoke: “Out.” Alcaraz had reached deuce. Breathing a sigh of relief, he held, then played a much more upbeat game to break for the set, finishing with a perfectly measured lob winner. He was grinning again.

Instead of caving, Fils quickly rebuilt a 3-1 lead in the third. But that only inspired Alcaraz to find another gear. Fils opened the door with an error-filled game at 3-2, and Alcaraz barreled through it. At 3-3, his backhand began to click. At 3-4, Fils tried to counter by going even bigger with his forehand, but sent the ball into the net and the doubles alley instead. Fils was broken for 5-3. A second or two later, his racquet was, too.“I just wanted to stay strong and wait for my chances,” Alcaraz said after his 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 win. “He puts a lot of pressure on his opponents. I could feel it.”Faced with an opponent who can slug with him, Alcaraz's drop shot helped make the difference.“I miss clay,” Alcaraz said. “I think on clay it's easier to play the drop shot; it's a weapon that I use a lot. Matches like this give me more confidence to keep doing it.”It was all the confidence he needed for the rest of the year, it turned out.

Looking back at Alcaraz's 2025, this win stands out as a turning point. He was coming off an opening-round loss in Miami to David Goffin, a defeat so traumatizing it left him telling reporters, “Mentally, I'm screwed.” After switching surfaces and fending off Fils, Alcaraz won Monte Carlo, Rome, and Roland Garros in quick succession.Fils, unfortunately, went in the other direction. A month later, his promising season was cut short when he fractured his back in Paris.Still, this was surely the first of many meetings between these two, and the start of a rivalry that should last a decade or more. On this day, Alcaraz's big-stage experience made the difference. When it mattered most, Fils overhit just a bit, while Alcaraz found his range just in time.

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Bearman furious after botched Haas pit stop

Red Bull have stated that comments made about Kimi Antonelli in Qatar were "clearly incorrect", after the Mercedes rookie faced abuse online.

Red Bull have said they "sincerely regret" the online abuse directed towards Kimi Antonelli following "clearly incorrect" comments suggesting the Mercedes rookie allowed title contender Lando Norris past in the Qatar Grand Prix.

With Max Verstappen on course to win at the Lusail International Circuit, Antonelli found himself running ahead of Norris in the closing stages of the race, thanks to a tyre strategy that had seen Mercedes pit both cars under the early Safety Car. That had gained Antonelli track position on Norris, who had slightly fresher hard tyres in the final stint.

Norris had closed to within DRS range of Antonelli, who was putting in a defensive masterclass to keep the McLaren at bay whilst also trying to catch up to Carlos Sainz ahead to fight for the final podium position. But with just two laps to go, Antonelli ran deep into a corner and that gave Norris the opportunity he needed to grab P4 and two extra vital points as he looks to secure his maiden title in Abu Dhabi next weekend.

Gianpiero Lambiase, Verstappen's race engineer, told the reigning champion over the radio: “Not sure what happened to Antonelli Max, looks like he just pulled over and let Norris through.” However, Lambiase was quick to apologise to Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff for the comment, conceding he had not seen the situation fully.

On Monday Red Bull released a statement that read: “Comments made before the end of, and immediately after, the Qatar GP suggesting that Mercedes driver Kimi Antonelli had deliberately allowed Lando Norris to overtake him are clearly incorrect.

"Replay footage shows Antonelli momentarily losing control of his car, thus allowing Norris to pass him. We sincerely regret that this has led to Antonelli receiving online abuse.”

Following the conclusion of the Qatar Grand Prix, which saw the title battle move on to the finale in Abu Dhabi, Wolff was asked in his post-race media session about the remarks made about Antonelli, describing the notion he would move aside as "nonsense".

“We are fighting for P2 in the championship, which is important for us," Wolff explained. "Kimi is fighting for a potential P3 [in the race].

“It annoys me, because I'm annoyed with the race itself, how it went. I'm annoyed with the mistake at the end. I'm annoyed with other mistakes and then hearing such nonsense blows my mind.

“The other thing is that, beyond losing the points for the Constructors' Championship, I spoke to GP [Lambiase]. I saw him and obviously he was emotional in that moment because they [McLaren] needed a P3, I guess, to win the championship or P4, I don't know, but one position… And I said to him, he [Antonelli] just went off.

“[Antonelli] had a bit of a moment in the previous corner and then less entry speed into that left-hander, put the gas down and at that moment, which can happen, that lost the position. So with GP, everything is clear. He said he didn't see the situation.”

As for the race itself, Wolff seemed frustrated that his drivers could not show the full potential of the car. Russell had dropped places at the start, while Antonelli lost out to Sainz – and also on a potential podium – in the first round of pit stops.

“We had a fast car in the Sprint, and I think we had a fast car today," Wolff added. "When you lose positions on the pit stop and you make mistakes in the race, obviously that's not going to help. I think if you start in free air, you fight in the front."

Mercedes are 33 points ahead of Red Bull in the championship, as they look to secure P2 behind McLaren. And while that is some consolation from the final season of the current regulations, Wolff admitted it was a far cry from what he and the team expected of themselves.

“I think when we look at the statistics in 20 years, you can say there was a P2 in 2013, then there were eight consecutive World Championships, and then there was a P2, P3, P4, P2.

“I think it's not humiliating. You look at the stats, and you say, well, that's a team that has fought on the front. If we are being totally honest with ourselves, then you need to say that there wasn't a single year [of the regulations] we were really fighting for a World Championship.

“That is the crux of the matter. I think McLaren has doubled the points than us, almost, and in the previous years it was Max that ruled the world. No one in the team thinks that that's good enough.”

The mission organically branched into working with the world's best film composers on special-event film screenings with a live score. Previous Wordless screenings, which select what films to adapt to a live score through the lens of the “21st-century canon,” have included “There Will Be Blood,” “Punch-Drunk Love,” “Phantom Thread,” “Moonlight,” and by far the company's biggest production, “The Tree of Life.”

Currently, the Wordless Music Orchestra is on the road with Sigur Rós, but that tour will end in time for Givony and crew to be on stage for the following shows.

Language courtesy of the event.

“Under the Skin,” February 20, 2026A one-time-only presentation of Jonathan Glazer's 2013 sci-fi/horror classic, starring Scarlett Johansson, with an original score by composer Mica Levi, performed live to picture by 30 members of the Wordless Music Orchestra under conductor Derrick Skye.

“Pearl,” June 12, 2026The World premiere live score of Ti West's 2022 technicolor horror film, the second in the “X” trilogy starring Mia Goth, with an original score by co-composers Tyler Bates and Timothy Williams, will be performed live to picture by 40 members of the Wordless Music Orchestra, conducted by Williams.

“Hereditary,” October 23, 2026The world premiere live performance of Ari Aster's 2018 debut feature, with an original score by composer Colin Stetson, performed live, in full to picture by 40 members of the Wordless Music Orchestra and the composer himself on saxophone.

“Eighth Grade,” December 11, 2026A one-time-only presentation of Bo Burnham's 2018 comedy, with an original score by composer Anna Meredith, performed live to picture by a three-piece all-electronic ensemble.

 










Back in 2015, Wordless worked closely with composer Mica Levi on the live orchestra adaptation of her unorthodox “Under the Skin” score, which they are bringing for this series. It's an example of how Givony hopes the tremendous amount of initial legwork that goes into debuting a live event screening — including obtaining a scoreless print of the film and creating up-to-date sheet music to match it — lays the groundwork for there to be more special live orchestra screenings in the future.

“There's always an element of translation in bringing a score from the recording studio to the stage,” Givony told IndieWire. “In the case of ‘Hereditary'—most of which was recorded by Colin Stetson himself, using extended/non-traditional technique—we connected Colin with a gifted composer/arranger named Conor Brown, who helped to arrange and orchestrate the music for a live ensemble.”

The Wordless Music founder said the process is always unique for each film, but the one commonality is their insistence that the original composer be put in the driver's seat, having collaborated closely with the biggest names in film scores, like Levi, Jonny Greenwood, Dan Romer, Jon Brion, Nicholas Brittell, and Ludwig Goransson on previous live score “adaptations.”

 










Another key ingredient for Wordless is to stage events at unique venues, for which the United Theater on Broadway (formerly the Theatre at Ace Hotel) qualifies. The 1,600-capacity, ornate Spanish Gothic theater is a former movie palace founded by Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith, and Douglas Fairbanks, as part of their United Artists' attempt to break from the studios. A history Givony thinks dovetails nicely with the independent spirit with which these four A24 titles were made.

EXCLUSIVE: The Duke is back. Bridgerton alum Regé-Jean Page is returning to Netflix as the star and executive producer of erotic thriller series Hancock Park. The project, which I hear landed at Netflix for development in a competitive situation with three major streamers bidding, comes from writer Matthew Barry (Industry), Drew Comins‘ Creative Engine (Yellowjackets) and Fifth Season. According to sources, it has been put on an accelerated development track with a script-to-series commitment.


Hancock Park is named after the historic and affluent Los Angeles neighborhood which counts Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos and Bridgerton executive producer Shonda Rhimes among longtime current and former residents.

	The series follows a dangerously charismatic outsider (Page), who invades the lives of a seemingly picture-perfect Los Angeles family when he rents their backyard guest house. But as he dives further into their world, the façade of this elite community begins to crumble, and he exposes the desire, deceit, and obsession that lurks around every corner of one of L.A.'s most-coveted neighborhoods.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In addition to writing, Barry is executive producing alongside Page and his producing partner Emily Brown through their A Mighty Stranger banner and Comins for Creative Engine. Fifth Season, where Comins has a first-look deal, is the studio.


	Page has the rare distinction of having both a series (Bridgerton Season 1) and a movie (The Gray Man) on Netflix's Top 10 most popular English-language lists. His starring role as the Duke of Hastings on the first season of Netflix's Regency romance drama catapulted Page into global stardom. He has been focused on movies since, starring in The Gray Man opposite Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, Steven Soderbergh's spy thriller Black Bag and Universal's upcoming romantic comedy You, Me & Tuscany, opposite Halle Bailey, which comes out in April.


	Through A Mighty Stranger, Page and Brown are developing a Count Of Monte Cristo movie at Department M for Page to star and Funny You Should Ask, a TV series adaptation of Elissa Sussman's best-selling novel, which is set up at Apple from Tomorrow Studios, also as a starring vehicle for Page. He is repped by UTA, Brillstein Entertainment Partners, attorney Gregory Slewett and Shelter PR.

	











	Welsh writer Barry served as a writer-producer on Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. He recently wrote Men Up, a Welsh TV movie for BBC One, which earned him a writing BAFTA Cymru Award, and the BBC miniseries The Guest. He is repped by WME and The Agency.


	At Netflix, Comins, two-time Emmy nominee for Yellowjackets, also has in the works the UK-based Dangerous Liaisons, from Mood creator and star Nicôle Lecky, which recently opened a writers room, a series adaptation of Adam Silvera's novel They Both Die at the End, with Bridgerton creator Chris Van Dusen writing and Bad Bunny producing, and Lena Dunham's Covers. Additionally, The Holdout, starring Amy Adams, is in development at HBO with Industry creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, and The Stowaway, starring Oscar Isaac, at Apple TV. Comins is repped by CAA and attorney Patti Felker.

The TikTok video shows ICE agents appearing to detain and arrest undocumented people, with Carpenter calling it "evil and disgusting" in an X post on Tuesday (Dec. 2).

Editor's note: Shortly after this story posted, Carpenter condemned the clip online. Read more about what she said here. 


	While performing the song “Juno” on her recently wrapped Short ‘n Sweet tour, Sabrina Carpenter would “arrest” a fan or celebrity in the crowd in a fun moment involving pink prop handcuffs. The bit was a viral sensation during the outing that ended last month and it was accompanied by another viral favorite section where Carpenter would ask the crowd if they wanted to try out some “freaky positions,” before busting out a unique pose and saying “Have you ever tried… this one?”


	On Monday (Dec. 1), the White House once again appropriated a playful pop culture meme to shine a light on its attempt to deport undocumented people. In a 14-second TikTok video cued to “Juno,” a series of people are shown angrily filming ICE agents as they swoop in to arrest people on the street, with close-ups of handcuffs being slapped on someone. A series of clips of chases and arrests are then cued to Carpenter asking, “Have you ever tried this one?”

	The caption to the clip reads “Have you ever tried this one? Bye-bye [wave heart eyes emoji].”


Billboard reached out to the White House to clarify if it got clearance from Carpenter to use her music in the ICE propaganda video.


	The video dropped less than a month after Olivia Rodrigo lambasted the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security posted an Instagram video soundtracked by her Guts track “All-American Bitch” showing ICE officers forcibly tackling, detaining and deporting people. In the comments, Rodrigo wrote, “don't ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda.” The video featured a montage of what appeared to be undocumented people voluntarily boarding DHS flights and giving a thumbs-up as they depart. “LEAVE NOW and self-deport using the CPB Home app,” read the caption. “If you don't, you will face consequences.”

	











	Carpenter, a vocal supporter of Trump's 2024 election rival Vice President Kamala Harris, is the latest artist to object to the president's repeated use of popular music for his political videos without their permission. The pace of such seemingly unsanctioned usage has ramped up over the past few months, with Kenny Loggins lashing out at Trump for using his Top Gun classic “Danger Zone” under an AI-generated video of the president seemingly dumping a river of fecal matter on American citizens participating in the anti-Trump “No Kings” protests.


	Swifties also aired their ire at the White House last month over a TikTok video set to Swift's hit Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping single “The Fate of Ophelia,” renamed “The Fate of America,” depicting Trump's mug shot from when he was charged with trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election results as well as an image of POTUS kissing an American flag. While Swift — an avowed Harris supporter who Trump has repeatedly said he “hates” — has not commented on the seemingly unauthorized appropriation of her music, the White House sent a response to Variety in which it gloated about owning the libs.


	Representatives said they made the video specifically to get “fake news media brands” to “breathlessly amplify” their message. “Congrats, you got played,” the rep said.

Sabrina Carpenter called out the “inhumane agenda” of the Donald Trump administration after the White House used her song “Juno” in a social media video featuring ICE agents carrying out arrests. 


	Posted Monday, the 20-second clip opened with footage of people ostensibly protesting against ICE raids, before transitioning to a montage of agents appearing to chase down and detain allegedly undocumented immigrants. The caption quoted Carpenter's lyrics, “Have you ever tried this one? Bye-bye.”


	On X, Carpenter responded to the video, writing, “This video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.” (As of publication, the video was still up on the White House's X and TikTok accounts. A rep for Carpenter did not immediately return Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.)


	Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement to Rolling Stone, “Here's a Short n' Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: We won't apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country. Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The decision to use “Juno” in the White House clip felt especially pointed: During Carpenter's most recent tour, she would playfully “arrest” someone in the crowd with fuzzy pink handcuffs during her performances of the Short n' Sweet tune. 


	While it seems unlikely, based on her response, that Carpenter gave the White House permission to use “Juno,” it's unclear if she will be able to do anything about it. The complex web of music licenses that governs the use of copyrighted music on social media platforms could make it difficult for Carpenter to have the video removed on the grounds of copyright infringement.

	While Trump has angered plenty of artists over the years for using their music without permission, the Carpenter situation most closely resembles a recent flare-up between Olivia Rodrigo and the Department of Homeland Security. The agency similarly used her song “All-American Bitch” in a video also showing ICE agents conducting raids and arrests. 


	Rodrigo responded on Instagram, “Don't ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda,” but the video remains up. (Rodrigo's comment was also deleted, though it's unclear if it was removed by her or DHS.)

UPDATED, with White House comment: Sabrina Carpenter blasted the White House on Tuesday for using her song Juno in an ICE deportation video.


	Carpenter wrote on X that the video “is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”


	The White House posted the video on Monday, featuring images of ICE officers detaining individuals, set to Carpenter's song as a soundtrack. Quoting from the lyrics, the White House posted on X, “Have you ever tried this one? Bye-bye.” 


	White House Abigail Jackson said in response, “Here's a Short n' Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: we won't apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country. Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?”

	The White House has featured the songs of other artists in deportation and other videos, raising their anger over their use without their OK. In October, Kenny Loggins objected to the use of his song Danger Zone in an AI generated video that depicted Trump dropping feces on No Kings protesters.


	“This is an unauthorized use of my performance of ‘Danger Zone.' Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately,” Loggins wrote. His music remains in the video on Trump's Truth Social account.

If only she and her label could find lawyers to go after them like they do internet companies.

Copyrights don't exist for Mother MAGA. In fact rights of any kind don't exist. If you send a check to his library maybe he'll consider using YMCA next time.

The best thing any of these “artists” can do is move out of LA, because their narrow worldview is wildly inconsistent with the mainstream public.

If the mainstream public supports the current incarnation of ICE and all they have been doing, then God help America

then they wouldn't have access to the davos class's astroturfing machine that gives them the illusion of fame, who selects people like sabrina because they willfully and ignorantly evangelize their agenda.

It's convenient when a beloved, hard-to-access TV show is added in its entirety to a streaming library. Think of how excited we all were when every season of The Simpsons was added to Disney+ in 2019, making the whole show accessible. Think of how confused we then were when we realized that Disney+ uses a different aspect ratio than Fox did back in the 90s, leaving some sight gags neutered. Yesterday, HBO Max uploaded the entirety of Mad Men, which was exciting and confusing for a different reason: Instead of cropping jokes out of the frame, an error somewhere in the process has revealed far too much. 

As Bluesky user Paul Haine pointed out this morning, the remastered Mad Men has at least once left a props coordinator in the background of a shot. The scene comes in the series' seventh episode, “Red In The Face” (though it's incorrectly listed on the streamer as the series' sixth episode, “Babylon.”) Don Draper takes Roger Sterling out for a boozy lunch of oysters and then leaves him to climb the stairs back to the Sterling Cooper office, where Roger promptly vomits in front of some clients. In the version that currently sits on HBO Max, two men controlling the vomit hose are clearly visible in the background of the shot. As fellow Bluesky users Cooper Lund and Todd Vaziri point out, it doesn't seem to be an issue of cropping but of post-production; the frame seems pretty identical to the original, which is still in the 16:9 aspect ratio but doesn't include the vomit hose guy. 

When HBO announced the news that Mad Men was coming to streaming, a spokesperson shared that the company was thrilled to “provide fans the opportunity to enjoy the series in a fresh way with an enhanced 4K viewing experience.” There's no doubt about that. As of this writing, it's unclear what other surprises may lie in wait for these mad men; those fans embarking on a rewatch probably haven't made it much further than the series seventh episode on its first day of availability. We hear that the streamer is in the process of updating the files, but in the meantime, we hope vomit hose guy enjoys his newfound glory.

The past decade of Hollywood horror has been dominated by names like Jordan Peele and Zach Cregger, creators who pivoted from short-form comedy careers to find massive success in genre filmmaking. In 2026, horror fans might be adding another name to that list: Curry Barker. 

Best known as one half of the “That's a Bad Idea” YouTube channel and as the director of the viral $800 short film “Milk & Serial,” Barker made his feature directorial debut with “Obsession,” a contemporary riff on a classic monkey's paw horror setup that became one of the breakout hits of the fall festival season. And a new teaser trailer offers a hint at what's in store when it opens in theaters next spring.

Written and directed by Barker, “Obsession” stars Michael Johnston as a romantically unsuccessful young man who asks a vintage wish-granting toy to make his crush (Inde Navarrette) become obsessed with him. The rest of the cast includes Cooper Tomlinson, Megan Lawless, and Andy Richter. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“Obsession” premiered in the Midnight Madness section of the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival, before making prestigious stops on the genre festival circuit like Fantastic Fest and Sitges. The film earned rave reviews from the start, prompting Focus Features to acquire it in the kind of buzzy festival deal that gets rarer and rarer with each passing year. Jason Blum also boarded the project as an executive producer through Blumhouse — arguably the biggest endorsement a new horror filmmaker can receive. 

“'Obsession' begins with the simplest of horror premises,” IndieWire's TIFF review read. “Bear is a shy and sensitive music store employee who can't find the courage to ask his co-worker and childhood friend Nikki on a date. Rather than be honest with her and tell her how he actually feels, he wanders into a woo-woo crystal store and buys a One Wish Willow, a kitschy antique toy from the 1960s that promises to grant its owner one wish when they snap a branch in half. The cashier warns him that most of the customers who buy them have complained about the results, but it wouldn't be much of a horror movie if he listened.”A Focus Features release, “Obsession” opens in theaters on May 15, 2026. Watch the film's first teaser trailer below.

The finale releases globally on both Netflix and in participating theaters Dec. 31 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET.

Managing Editor, East Coast


Stranger Things: The Finale is coming.


	The highly anticipated final showdown of the mega-hit series will be simultaneously playing out on both the small and big screen, and Netflix on Tuesday revealed both the official runtime for the feature-length ending, as well as the locations where fans can see the final episode in movie theaters.




	First, the official run time for The Finale will be two hours and five minutes.


	Next, fan screenings of the final episode of the coming-of-age sci-fi saga will be taking place in more than 500 theaters in the U.S. and Canada starting on Dec. 31 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET — the same time the episode makes its global premiere on Netflix — and will run through Jan. 1, 2026.

	Visit www.ST5Finale.com for the full list of participating cities and theater locations and to RSVP. Exhibitors are selling a concession voucher for fans to reserve seats via an RSVP list, meaning Netflix won't earn revenue on the fan screenings.


	Netflix along with creators Matt and Ross Duffer had announced that Stranger Things: The Finale would be coming to theaters in addition to streaming back in October, reversing course on earlier statements made by the streamer that the ending would not play on the big screen.


	“We're beyond excited that fans will have the chance to experience the final episode of Stranger Things in theaters — it's something we've dreamed about for years, and we're so grateful to Ted [Sarandos], Bela [Bajaria] and everyone at Netflix for making it happen,” the Duffer brothers said at the time in a statement. “Getting to see it on the big screen, with incredible sound, picture and a room full of fans, feels like the perfect — dare we say bitchin' — way to celebrate the end of this adventure.”

	











	The Duffers elaborated further when recently speaking to The Hollywood Reporter about the final season, which released its first part of a three-part release on Nov. 26. (Volume 2 hits on Christmas with three episodes, followed by The Finale on New Year's Eve.)


	“Initially, that wasn't the plan at all,” Matt told THR of the epic ending coming to theaters. “Originally, the finale season was just going to be split into two volumes: Volume 1 and Volume 2. Then after we were done filming, Netflix approached us with the idea of putting the finale on its own day, which we thought was cool because it would allow us to pitch our movie theater idea. So we pitched them and the reason we've never pitched it before [is] because it just never really made sense given how the show is released. What's fun about seeing something in the theater, we think, is that everyone is experiencing it for the first time together. What we liked about this particular release pattern is that it allows that opportunity for a group of fans to sit and watch this unfold together.”


	Matt previously told THR that the creators have known “for a really long time” what the final scene of the series would be, and that the brothers plan to sneak into one of the participating theaters to witness the audience's reactions. “Otherwise you're just going off TikTok and YouTube videos or whatever,” he said. “We've never had that experience before, so we're excited. It's also going to sound and look better.”

	











	The Duffer Brothers recently signed a four-year exclusive deal with Paramount to create feature films after their Netflix contract ends next year. The move also follows Netflix's success in releasing KPop Demon Hunters as a sing-along theatrical event this summer. 


	Since Stranger Things debuted in 2016, the series has become one of Netflix's most popular television series ever, with its fourth season alone amassing over 140.7M views globally.


	The sprawling cast includes Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo,  Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, Maya Hawke, Priah Ferguson, Brett Gelman, Jamie Campbell Bower, Cara Buono, Amybeth McNulty, Nell Fisher, Jake Connelly, Alex Breaux and Linda Hamilton.


	Ahead of Stranger Things 5‘s release, all four previous seasons landed in the Top 10, marking the first time a series has had four previous seasons in the Top 10 all at the same time.


	Created by the Duffer brothers, Stranger Things is produced by Upside Down Pictures & 21 Laps Entertainment with the Duffer brothers as executive producers, along with Shawn Levy of 21 Laps Entertainment and Dan Cohen.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	After a multi-country casting search, young English actor Jack Alldridge has landed the lead in Foster Dade, Hulu‘s YA drama pilot written by Greg Berlanti and Bash Doran and directed by Daniel Minahan, which comes from Warner Bros. TV and studio-based Berlanti Productions.


	Based on Nash Jenkins' debut novel Foster Dade Explores the Cosmos, Foster Dade takes place in 2008 and present day. It is described as a sophisticated mystery set at an East Coast boarding school that explores privilege, scandal, sexuality and masculinity amid the rise of social media, millennial anxiety and pharmaceuticals.

	The story revolves around Foster Dade (Alldridge), a new transfer student at the elite Kennedy boarding school. He arrives at Kennedy as a lonely, anxious, ferocious reader who self-medicates and blogs at his psychologist's insistence. Possessed of a depth of soul Foster doesn't yet know what to do with, he aches to be liked, to fall in love, to be known in a way his fractured home life never allowed. He has no idea that his hunger for reinvention will place him at the center of the greatest scandal the school has ever seen and that his name will be whispered by Kennedy students for decades to come.

	Alldridge joins previously cast Chloe East, who plays the female lead Annabeth, a popular girl at Kennedy who takes Foster under her wing; Cameron Mann, who portrays fellow student Jack Albright; and Matt Bomer, who plays Alex Tierney, a brilliant teacher at the school.

	











	Berlanti Prods.' Berlanti, Sarah Schechter and Leigh London Redman executive produce alongside Doran, Jenkins, Robbie Rogers as well as Donald De Line of De Line Pictures. Filming on the pilot is slated to begin today, Dec. 2, in New York.


	A 2023 graduate of the Guildford School of Acting, Alldridge plays President James A. Garfield's (Michael Shannon) son Harry in Netflix's recently released limited series Death by Lightning. He also stars in the 2025 Christmas commercial of UK department store chain John Lewis — a British holiday staple — which has been viewed more than 2 million times on YouTube alone since its debut a month ago. (You can watch it below.)


	”We knew the titular character of Foster Dade would be the heart and soul of this show. We needed an actor that could embody the full range of emotion and toe the line between hero and anti-hero,” Berlanti, Schechter and Doran said in a statement. “After a worldwide search and seeing thousands of talented young actors we were lucky enough to find Jack Alldridge. Fresh out of drama school, Jack is an extraordinary talent. He has a bright future ahead and we are lucky to be a part of it.”


	Alldridge will next be seen in the BritBox/ITV1 series The Lady and Season 15 of BBC/PBS' Call The Midwife, both slated for release in 2026. He is repped by Hatch, Anonymous Content and CAA.

Lisa Rinna made one of her most dramatic red carpet appearances to date, turning heads for both her outfit and her atypical glam.

Attending the 2025 British Fashion Awards on Monday night, Rinna was the guest of designer Maximilian Raynor, modeling his sculptural creation on the red carpet.

Her glam team (including hair by Sam Elliot) took her to the next level with a bleached bouffant-style ‘do and bleached eyebrows to match, rendering the soap star nearly unrecognizable.

The ensemble was crafted using gingham plaid in a black-and-white pattern. It featured dramatic high shoulders and a peplum waist that merged into a fitted, thickly fringed skirt.

“It's head-to-toe couture, honey,” Rinna told The Perfect Magazine on the red carpet. “It is couture, but it's couture made to me … for me, by him,” she added as she gestured towards Raynor.

10 Magazine went behind the scenes before the event, chatting with Rinna and Raynor about the evening and — of course — the look.

“For me, someone who is in LA … to come to the British Fashion Awards is so iconic,” she said. “It's like … better than the Met Gala,” she quietly added.

“I said it! I think it's chicer than the Met Gala. Only … I've never been … but I would still like to do.”

The designer described the custom, couture look as “drama, glamour, LA meets London … sort of, like, vampish meets midcentury.”

Which is exactly what Rinna's retro-inspired hairstyle contributed to the vibe.

“It's in this amazing check that's kind of like your granddad's shirt, but taken and elevated,” he continued, adding, “It's really an exploration of that, but fused with the women's textiles of Maximilian Raynor.”

Though this might go down as one of the star's most dramatic red carpet looks, it isn't the first time that she changed her signature brunette bob to fit the moment.

Rinna attended the Viktor & Rolf Haute Couture fall 2025 show in Paris last summer, where she stepped out in a trench coat with a similarly oversized shoulder, bleached (and slightly purple) hair in a bouffant-style updo.

As for her latest head-turning look? 

“I'm very excited for Lisa to be the first to wear it,” Raynor shared.

Comcast, Netflix and Paramount submitted their revised offers Monday, including an almost all-cash deal from Netflix, and a cash deal from Paramount backed by Apollo and Middle East funds.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	The future of Warner Bros. Discovery is hanging in the balance, with the entertainment company's board of directors now weighing second round bids for the company from Comcast, Paramount and Netflix.


	The offers were due Monday, and all three companies submitted their revised plans.




	While the specific cash amounts were not immediately clear (also complicated by the fact that only Paramount is pursuing the whole company), the second round bids included some notable tweaks. Netflix, for example, is now a mostly cash bid, after initially leaning on its stock as a key part of the deal.

	And Paramount is offering all-cash, having secured debt financing from the private equity giant Apollo, as well as unknown Middle East sovereign wealth funds. The nature of the debt financing means that Ellison and Redbird will retain total control of Paramount if they are successful in their bid.

	Barring any surprise late bidders or a call by the WBD board to continue with their split, one of the three media giants is likely to emerge as the buyer of assets that include the venerable Warner Bros. film and TV studios, HBO and HBO Max, and IP that includes DC Comics, Friends, and Harry Potter.


	So what happens next? WBD's board will need to weigh the new offers, and either request a third round of bids if they feel they can extract more compelling offers, or pick a winner and start working on a binding agreement.

	











To split or not to split: This is in many ways the fundamental question about the future of WBD. The company was planning to split itself in two: A streaming and studio business, and a linear TV business. Paramount wants the whole thing, while Comcast and Netflix want to stay away from linear. Does the company sell itself whole (likely to Paramount) or split itself, either in a sale or a continuation of its previous process?


Regulatory hell: The Trump administration has made it clear that David Ellison and his father Larry Ellison would have an easier regulatory path, fresh off their deal for Paramount. At the same time, anonymous administration sources have made it clear to friendly voices like Fox Business Network and the New York Post's Charlie Gasparino that Netflix and Comcast would face scrutiny. How tough will the government be? And will it dissuade the WBD board from cutting a deal with anyone that doesn't have the last name Ellison?


Film's future: Netflix is not in the theatrical film business, really. NBCUniversal and Paramount are. But if the WBD studios are sold, what happens to its film studio, which has had a breakout year under the leadership of Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy? Netflix has reportedly promised continues theatrical releases, but does that mean the same sort of wide release WB has done? Or a Netflix-ified version? Would NBCU or Paramount really just double their film output? Or is the future of WB more like 20th Century Fox, as a niche with a few releases under the larger umbrella?

	











Sports superpower: WBD may have lost its NBA rights, but its portfolio still includes prime MLB and NHL deals, one half of the March Madness college basketball tourney (Paramount has the rest) and other rights that include the French Open and college football. When added to the portfolios of Paramount or NBCU, it could make for a compelling sports proposition, a sports media giant that would rival only ESPN in scale. But with those rights set to travel with the linear TV business, their future remains uncertain.


What about Zas? WBD CEO David Zaslav has made no secret of his love of the game. He hosts star-studded dinners at his Beverly Hills mansion (once known as Woodland, the estate of mogul Robert Evans), he has sought out meetings and held court at his U.S. Open suite with A-listers and tycoons. Would he really hang up his power suit (or power vest?) that easily? Paramount has reportedly offered him a major role, so it stands to reason that others may make similar offers as further enticement for a deal.


Mystery bidder: We know that Paramount, Comcast and Netflix have submitted bids, but that doesn't preclude a surprise bidder entering the fray. Perhaps, say, a private equity firm backed by Middle Eastern money? Or a Japanese entertainment conglomerate with an American partner? Don't count out any surprises.

Sean Combs sent Aubrey O'Day a string of sexually explicit emails and images of his penis while they were filming Making the Band, the singer alleges in a new Netflix documentary about the Bad Boy founder. 


	“I don't want to just fuck you, I want to turn you out,” O'Day reads aloud in Sean Combs: The Reckoning, which premiered today. “I can see you being with some motherfucker that you tell what to do. I make my woman do what I tell her to do, and she loves it. I just want and like to do things different. I'm-a finish watching this porn and finish masturbating. I'll think of you. If you change your mind and get ready to do what I say, hit me.” 


	The email, dated March 23, 2008, included Combs' standard signature at the time: “God bless. Diddy. God is the Greatest.” O'Day said she continually rebuffed Combs' sexual advances and was eventually kicked out of Danity Kane. “I absolutely felt that I was fired for not participating sexually,” she said in the film. 

	











	O'Day has long been vocal about her negative experience at Bad Boy, and the MTV reality show often highlighted Combs singling out O'Day over her appearance, what he believed was a bad attitude, and calling her “overly raunchy, promiscuous.” However, this is the first time the Danity Kane member has gone into detail about the alleged sexual harassment she faced off-camera. 


	It was only within the past two years, O'Day said, that she learned of an affidavit from a woman who claimed she had seen an incapacitated O'Day being sexually assaulted by Combs and another man in 2005. “I don't even know if I was raped,” O'Day added, stressing she had no recollection of the alleged assault. “And I don't want to know.” (A rep for Combs did not immediately reply to a request for comment.)

	











	O'Day's account is part of new revelations and allegations leveled against the disgraced mogul in the Netflix docuseries. It features interviews with former Bad Boy artist Mark Curry, Diddy-Dirty Money member Kalenna Harper, former staffer Capricorn Clark, Bad Boy co-founder Kirk Burrowes, and others. The four-part series includes never-before-seen footage of the night the Notorious B.I.G. was gunned down in March 1997, as well as a panicked 911 call as the rapper's friend raced him to the emergency room, where he was pronounced dead.

	Directed by Alexandria Stapleton and executive-produced by rapper Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, the project also obtained footage of a stressed Combs days before he was arrested on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. (The 56-year-old was acquitted of the more serious charges in July, but he was sentenced to 50 months in prison after being found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution charges.) 


	Combs' team have accused the streamer of using “stolen” material that was never authorized for release and labeled the documentary as a “shameful hit piece.” (Rolling Stone has reached out for comment on O'Day's accusations.)


	Here are five other takeaways from the docuseries:  


	Six days before Combs was arrested on federal criminal charges, footage he intended to use in his own documentary shows him strategizing with his sons, lawyers, then-chief of staff, and entourage on how to fight his quickly tarnishing reputation. The brief window into Combs' inner sanctum reveals him to be a master strategist, constantly thinking of how to control the narrative around him. 


	“He's creating a narrative, always,” explained Capricorn Clark, one of Combs' longtime and high-ranking Bad Boy employees. “He's the best storyteller in hip-hop. He thinks he's Black Superman, ‘I can do what I want.'”

	When discussing how current media coverage could prove damaging at trial, Combs ordered his team to find “somebody that has dealt in the dirtiest of dirtiest, dirty business of media and propaganda” to target potential jurors. He reasoned that some people might not watch CNN and that his team should look to social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram to reach his intended audience. 


	Spotting police officers on a nearby roof, Combs instructed his videographer to get “cutaway shots” of the uniformed officials. He organized a jaunt up to Harlem, smiling as he took pictures with fans and happily downing shots at a local bar. When he jumped back into his waiting SUV, Combs' mask dropped. “I need some hand sanitizer,” he said. “I've been out in the streets amongst the people. I gotta take a bath.” 

	











	“I began to see him use the culture only when he needed it,” said Combs' former head of security Roger Bonds. “Now you're walking around Harlem because you know that the world turned their back on you, so now you will come back home, hoping that Harlem got your back.”


	Combs was seen raging in real time when he learned of former Danity Kane and Diddy-Dirty Money artist Dawn Richard's lawsuit against him, declaring that the “gloves are off.” He directed people in his camp, including his adult son Justin, to circulate old clips of Richard praising him in interviews. He also called in a favor from Kalenna Harper, who was in the group Diddy-Dirty Money, begging her to release a statement disputing Richard's claims. (Harper eventually released a statement.) During pretrial hearings, Southern District of New York prosecutors pointed to Combs' repeated calls and texts to Harper as a form of witness tampering. (Combs' attorneys denied the accusation.) 


	For the first time, a man and woman who served as jurors at Combs' eight-week criminal trial over the summer explained why they acquitted Combs of sex trafficking his former girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura. Although both jurors conceded Combs was extremely violent toward the “Me & U” singer, one woman, identified only as Juror 160, reasoned that Combs wasn't charged with domestic violence. 


	The man, identified as Juror 75, said he couldn't understand why Ventura repeatedly went back to Combs. Using language similar to what Combs' attorney Marc Agnifilo used in his closing arguments as he beseeched the jury to find Combs innocent, the man said he believed the couple were deeply in love but locked in a toxic relationship. 


	“That was a very, very interesting relationship,” he explained. “This is two people in love; they are overly in love. You cannot explain. She wanted to be with him. He took her for granted. He never thought that she would leave him. So [it's] like both hands clapping together. You cannot clap with one hand, [you have to use] both hands, then you get the noise. 


	“Justice was served, 100 percent,” he added. “We saw both sides of it, and we came to our conclusions.” 


	After Ventura filed her bombshell sexual abuse lawsuit against Combs in November 2023, Joi Dickerson-Neal had two distinct feelings. The first was a deep sense of sadness for Ventura, and the second was relief: She wasn't alone. Dickerson-Neal quickly filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in New York, days before a special look-back window for previously time-barred complaints closed.  

	











	Speaking for the first time, Dickerson-Neal did not rehash her date with Combs in 1991, which allegedly ended in her being drugged and sexually assaulted. (Combs has denied her claims.) However, she produced a note that her mother had penned to Combs' mother, Janice, detailing how Dickerson-Neal woke up screaming from a nightmare she had about “Puffy.” 


	“I'm writing to inform you of something that your son did to my daughter that has greatly decreased the quality of her life and wreaked havoc on our entire family,” Dickerson-Neal read aloud from the letter, dated Nov. 26, 1992. “I realize that this may be hard for you to believe, but if I hadn't heard this story from my daughter's own mouth and looked into her eyes, I would have scarcely believed that any individual would compromise another person's dignity in this manner.


	“She said that he, without her knowledge, videotaped my daughter having sexual intercourse with him,” her mother wrote, adding that Dickerson-Neal suspected Combs showed the tape to “at least 60 or more” people. “Apparently, your son shows these tapes to all of his friends at parties on large screen televisions,” she wrote. “From what I understand, he has done this to several other girls.”


	Dickerson-Neal said she once bumped into Combs and confronted him about the alleged assault, but he dropped to his knees and denied everything. “When I think back in terms of his rise, it is the most helpless feeling,” Dickerson-Neal added, saying she once threw up when she saw an image of Combs in Times Square with his fist raised high in the air. “You are really raising your hand at victory, and I'm living in trauma and defeat.” 


	Over eight years, former male escort Clayton Howard claimed to have been hired by Combs and Ventura for freak-offs every few weeks, flying across the country to engage in dayslong sex sessions. 


	Howard said Combs was very particular, giving Ventura instructions and feedback about how she should be positioned, either granting or denying her permission on when she could move onto the next stage of the sexual encounter. He claimed to have witnessed numerous instances where Combs beat Ventura during the middle of a freak-off. “Every time she got assaulted, she would run out,” Howard said. “She would always come back.” 


	There was clear drug use during the freak-offs, Howard added. “I don't think I ever encountered Puff at a time where he wasn't high out of his face,” he recalled. “They used to lace the baby oil with GHB. He told me there was a little G in the baby oil.” (Both Combs and Ventura previously denied that there were drugs in the baby oil.) 

	











	Howard said “the weirdest thing” that occurred during the freak-offs was that “they used to physically collect my semen in a cup.” It was “creepy” to Howard, who finally asked what they were doing with it. Combs allegedly responded that he liked to watch Ventura “play with it and drink it.” 


	It also always stuck out to Howard that the couple would organize a freak-off every year on March 9 — the date of Notorious B.I.G.'s death. “I would hang out, drink, and party with them for three or four days while I had sex with Casandra,” he said. “I don't know if that was his release for that day or whatever, but they always called me on March 9.”

	The docuseries briefly highlights Combs' history of alleged violence with both men and former girlfriends, including Misa Hylton, Kim Porter, and Ventura. It also raises a new accusation from Bad Boy co-founder Kirk Burrowes, who claims Combs once became physical with his mother, Janice. 


	It was shortly after the City College of New York tragedy in December 1991, where nine people died in a stampede at a charity celebrity basketball event Combs organized. At the time, Combs was still a rising star at Uptown Records, and he was placed on administrative leave as officials investigated the incident. Depressed and holed up in a hotel, Burrowes said Janice asked Combs whether he was sure he wanted to continue in the music business and whether it was a wise choice for him. “I saw him put his hands on her, call her ‘bitch,' and slapped her,” Burrowes claimed.

A new trailer for Taylor Swift's forthcoming Disney+ docuseries spotlights the emotional speech she delivered during her final Eras Tour concert.

The “Opalite” singer expressed her gratitude to thousands of Swifties in the stands at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver on Dec. 8, 2024, according to a teaser for “Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show.”

“We've had so long to prepare for the end of this tour, and we get to play one last show for you here tonight,” she told concertgoers at the time.

“I want to thank every single one of you for being a part of the most thrilling chapter of my entire life to date,” she added.

Swift, 35, announced in the teaser that the film, which premieres Dec. 12, will include a new acoustic set.

She was seen singing the beginning lyrics to her song “Long Live” — the final track of her 2010 album, “Speak Now” — while playing the piano in a sparkly purple gown.

The six-episode special features behind-the-scenes moments from her tour, including rehearsals, her life on the road and plenty of PDA with her fiancé, Travis Kelce.

Other notable faces featured in the project include Sabrina Carpenter, who opened for several of Swift's shows, as well as her collaborators Gracie Abrams and Ed Sheeran.

“The Eras Tour | The Final Show, featuring the entire Tortured Poets Department set, and the first two episodes of The End of an Era, a 6-episode behind-the-scenes docuseries will be yours December 12th on @disneyplus,” she announced in an Instagram post at the time. 

Swift was also busy writing two new albums during the record-breaking world tour, releasing “The Tortured Poets Department” in April 2024 and “The Life of a Showgirl” in October 2025. 

The pop star also re-recorded her “Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and” and “1989 (Taylor's Version)” while touring the globe.

Miley Cyrus has something beautiful on her left ring finger.

The pop star, 33, flashed her brand new engagement ring on the red carpet for “Avatar: Fire And Ash” on Monday, showing off the jewelry while posing arm-in-arm with fiancé Maxx Morando. 

The cushion cut sparkler is a 14-karat gold creation by celeb-favorite jewelry designer Jacquie Aiche, a rep for the company tells Page Six Style.

Marion Fasel, jewelry historian and founder of the online jewelry magazine The Adventurine, tells Page Six Style that the rock is an east-west set natural diamond. “Given the skyrocketing price of gold, it makes sense that the metal plays almost as big a role as the diamond in the piece,” she says.

“The design is in the same mode as Dua Lipa's engagement ring,” Fasel continues. “Other than that, there isn't much historical precedent. It's a new trend in engagement rings. In the past, this style would have been worn on the right hand. I love it as an engagement ring because it looks and feels substantial.”

Daniela Tarantino, VP of Merchandising at Blue Nail, offered her estimate, speculating, “We believe the ring is roughly a 4-5 carat modified cushion that costs around $300K-$450k.” However, the true size and cost of the eye-catching engagement ring remain up for debate, as a representative for the jewelry designer declined to comment.

At the Dolby Theatre premiere, Cyrus placed her hand on the chest of her beau of four years, giving photographers a clear view of the rock.

The Grammy Winner coordinated with Morando, 27, in matching all-black looks. The “Hannah Montana” alum dazzled in a sequined strapless Gucci gown with a dramatic ruffled train, while the Liily drummer looked dapper in a classic tuxedo.

Aiche is also behind many A-list stars' most sentimental pieces, including Selena Gomez's custom “B” initial ring for then-fiancé Benny Blanco and Gigi Hadid's “Mama” necklace, which the model debuted after the birth of her daughter Khai in 2020.

Cyrus, for her part, is a longtime fan of Aiche's work, having accessorized with the designer's dainty body chains and diamond earrings on many occasions. 

She also wore Jacquie Aiche earrings when she married her ex, Liam Hemsworth, in December 2018. The couple were together on and off for a decade, but split after less than a year of marriage.

The engagement news comes just months after Hemsworth announced his own engagement to model Gabriella Brooks in September 2025.

Ahead of the full reveal on Dec. 9 — after the Billboard 2025 No. 1s Livestream, hosted by Druski — check out three R&B/hip-hop top 10s.

	Keith Caulfield



	The full list of Billboard's 2025 year-end charts are almost here, and we're counting down the days to their unveiling on Tuesday, Dec. 9, with a special look at select rankings in the lead-up to the big reveal — and today (Dec. 2)., we have the top 10s of three of the year-end R&B/hip-hop charts.


	On Dec. 9, hundreds of year-end charts will be posted on Billboard's website, following the conclusion of the Billboard 2025 No. 1s Livestream, hosted by Druski, which will broadcast on the Billboard News YouTube channel and BillboardTV on Samsung TV Plus starting at noon ET/9 a.m. PT, as special surprise guests stop by to celebrate the year in chart-toppers.


	Today, we're dropping the top 10s of the 2025 Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and Hot R&B Songs charts.


Kendrick Lamar and SZA‘s “Luther” leads the year-end Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs roundup, following its unstoppable run on the weekly version of the chart. It debuted on the chart dated Dec. 7, 2024, climbed to No. 1 just two weeks later, and was on the chart during the rest of the 2025 chart year (Oct. 26, 2024, through Oct. 18, 2025), never falling below No. 3.


	SZA, meanwhile, crowns the year-end Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums recap, with a project that debuted on the weekly chart on Dec. 24, 2022 — SOS. It's the second time the title has finished atop the year-end Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, as it also reigned in 2023. (It was the No. 2 album of 2024.) The album's chart performance in 2025 was enhanced by its expanded reissue with additional songs in December 2024, dubbed SOS Deluxe: LANA. All versions of the album, old and new, are combined together with the original album for tracking and charting. During the 2025 chart year, SOS never left the chart, spent 15 weeks at No. 1, and never ranked below No. 6.


The Weeknd and Playboi Carti‘s “Timeless” tops the year-end Hot R&B Songs chart. The track premiered at No. 1 on the Oct. 12, 2024-dated Hot R&B Songs chart, and remained on the list through the July 19, 2025, chart. During that span, it spent 20 weeks atop the ranking, never going lower than No. 4. “Timeless” marked the 12th No. 1 for The Weeknd and the first for Playboi Carti.


	For the top 10 of the three lists, scroll below. The full depth of the three rankings (beyond the top 10s of each) will be posted Dec. 9 alongside the complete menu of Billboard‘s 2025 year-end charts.


	Billboard's year-end music charts represent aggregated metrics for each artist, title, label and music contributor on the weekly charts from Oct. 26, 2024, through Oct. 18, 2025. Rankings for Luminate-based recaps reflect equivalent album units, airplay, sales or streaming during the weeks that the entries appeared on a respective chart during the tracking year. Any activity registered before or after a title's chart run isn't considered in these rankings. That methodology detail, and the October-October time period, account for some of the difference between these lists and the calendar-year recaps that are independently compiled by Luminate.

EXCLUSIVE: In a star pairing of two top English actors of their generation, Nicholas Hoult (Superman) and Daisy Edgar-Jones (Twisters) are set as the leads of Mosquito, a Hulu original series from Oscar-nominated writer Tony McNamara (Poor Things), which has received a six-episode straight-to-series order. Part of Disney+‘s UK original slate, the dark, wry comedy will stream on Disney+ internationally and Hulu in the U.S.


	Described as a sardonic look at a young couple's relationship, Mosquito brings Hoult, Edgar-Jones and McNamara back to Hulu where they were part of two signature 2020 series. McNamara created and Hoult starred in the comedy-drama The Great, which ran for three seasons, while Edgar-Jones starred in the limited series Normal People. Both shows were hits with viewers and critics, landing Golden Globe acting nominations for Hoult and Edgar-Jones and Best TV Series – Musical or Comedy for McNamara. (Hoult and McNamara, along with female lead Elle Fanning, also earned Emmy nominations for their work on The Great.)

Mosquito channels the dark, absurdist humor of The Great — as well as McNamara's film work — while exploring the next stage in a young couple's relationship which Normal People fans wished to see Marianne (Edgar-Jones) and Connell (Paul Mescal) embark on. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The series centers on Kate (Edgar-Jones) and Ed (Hoult), a recently married couple whose secrets begin to reveal as daily life chips away at the personas they present… all started by an intrusive mosquito.

	











	“I'm thrilled and excited to work with and team up two of the best actors around,” said Mosquito writer and executive producer McNamara. “I can't wait to go make absurd comedy with them.”


	The series is produced by 20th Television, Piggy Ate Roast Beef Productions and Hustle & Punch. McNamara executive produces with Hoult, Edgar-Jones, Marian Macgowan, former ABC Signature president-turned-producer Tracy Underwood under her 20th TV overall deal, and Daniel Pipski. The series was commissioned for Disney+ by Lee Mason, Disney EMEA executive director. Filming begins in 2026.


	This marks the first major UK series greenlight since Eric Schrier, President, Disney Television Studios and Global Original Television Strategy, The Walt Disney Co., appointed Angela Jain as Head of Content, Disney+ EMEA in June.


	“Tony is one of the most talented writers working in film and television today, with a legacy of incredible success at Disney,” Schrier and Jain said in a joint statement. 


	All of McNamara's projects released over the past seven years have been for Disney entities: The Great for Hulu on the TV side and movies The Favourite, Poor Things and The Roses for Searchlight and Cruella for Walt Disney Pictures. His collaborations with Yorgos Lanthimos on The Favourite and Poor Things earned McNamara two writing Oscar nominations and a BAFTA award.  


	“He has an unmatched ability to bring fascinating and complex stories to life weaving sharply written, intricate dialogue with signature dark-humor and complexity,” Schrier and Jain continued. “Partnering with him on Mosquito is an incredible step forward for our local original content and reinforces our ambitions in the UK.”


	Disney+'s UK originals slate delivered a breakout hit in Rivals, which last week won the International Emmy for drama series. It is expected to return for Season 2 in 2026. 


	Edgar-Jones has three high-profile movies coming up, Sense and Sensibility, A Place In Hell with Michelle Williams and Here Comes the Flood with Denzel Washington and Robert Pattinson. She is repped by UTA, B-Side Management and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern.


	Coming off Superman and Nosferatu, Hoult will next be seen in How To Rob a Bank opposite Anna Sawai, Pete Davidson and Zoë Kravitz and also has Tom Ford's next film Cry to Heaven and a return as Lex Luther in Superman sequel Man of Tomorrow lined up. He is repped by UTA, 42 and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern.


	Australian-born McNamara is repped by UTA, Sugar23, HLA Management and Frankfurt, Kurnit, Klein & Selz.

	Former Full House star Dave Coulier is undergoing treatment for tongue cancer just under a year after beating non-Hodgkin lymphoma.


	Coulier revealed that he's now battling HPV-related oropharyngeal tongue cancer in a new interview with Today. “To go through chemotherapy and feel that relief of whoa, it's gone, and then to get a test that says, well, now you've got another kind of cancer … it is a shock to the system,” Coulier said.


	Oropharyngeal tongue cancer forms in the middle section of the throat, known as the oropharynx, per the American Cancer Society. The oropharynx includes parts of the tongue, the back part of the roof of the mouth, and the tonsils, all of which help with breathing, eating, swallowing, and talking. Saliva is produced in the oropharynx, too.


	Coulier said his doctors first noticed the new cancer during a routine PET scan check-up after he'd completed chemotherapy for his non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The comedian said something “flared on the scan” at the base of his tongue, so a biopsy was performed. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“It was very painful. It's like if you bit your tongue, but the pain just lasted every single day,” Coulier said.


	While the initial biopsy didn't show signs of cancer, the same spot had grown when Coulier returned for his next PET scan. Coulier went to an ear, nose, and throat oncologist for more testing, and after a CT scan, an MRI, and a second biopsy to remove an even larger part of his tongue, the results came back positive for cancer cells. 

	











	“[The doctors] said it's totally unrelated to my non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This is a new cancer,” Coulier recalled. “I said, ‘Are you kidding me?'”


	Coulier's doctors told him the cancer could've stemmed from a long-dormant HPV virus that “activated and turned into a carcinoma.” But luckily, the comedian added, his doctors found the cancer early enough that was considered “very treatable.”


	“It's got a 90 percent curability rate,” Coulier said. “The doctor said the prognosis is good, but we're going to start radiation immediately.”

	Coulier said his radiation treatments are less “aggressive” than chemo, there are still “side effects” like nausea and brain fog; he's also still contending with some residual pain from the biopsies. But Coulier and his doctors expect the cancer to be gone by the time he finishes radiation at the end of the year. 


	“My joke usually is … I'm doing really well for a guy with cancer,” Coulier quipped.

More than two years after David Lowery's new feature, “Mother Mary,” was announced, even the people involved in the film don't quite seem to know how to talk about it. But one thing that's resoundingly clear is that the hotly anticipated A24 title — which has been described as a “weird, weird film” by the “Peter Pan and Wendy” director and “transformative” by its cast — is going to be a wild ride. 

“Mother Mary” stars Anne Hathaway as a seething pop singer who becomes embroiled in a psychosexual affair with an old friend and fashion designer, played by “I May Destroy You” multi-hyphenate Michaela Coel. The trailer, which dropped Tuesday, gives audiences their first real taste of the twisted relationship between Mary (Hathaway) and Sam (Coel), who are brought back into each other's orbit by the pop singer's need for a dress that will breathe life into her comeback tour.

After being reunited, the estranged friends spend most of the film shacked up in a 13th-century barn that acts as Sam's atelier — trading violent looks over chiseled cheekbones and conjuring up old demons. As the dress comes together with the help of Sam's stone-faced assistant (Hunter Schafer), and seances are performed, a soundtrack featuring original songs by Charli XCX, Jack Antonoff, and FKA Twigs plays in the background, making for an “epic pop melodrama” with an occult flair.

 










Leading up to the trailer's release, most of what's been known about “Mother Mary” has come from its stars, who've primarily spoken about the challenging and intense experience of making it — which Lowery, for his part, has compared to shooting “Apocalypse Now.” Speaking with Vogue, Hathaway described how the film was an exercise in relinquishing control, both because she had to ad-lib the onscreen singing scenes and because she had to abandon her polished approach to performing and surrender herself to the material. 

“I had to submit to being a beginner,” she said. “The humility of that — showing up every day knowing you're going to suck. And it has to be OK. You're not ‘bad.' You're just a beginner. Getting to that mindset — I had to shed some things that were hard to shed. It was welcome. But it was hard, the way transformational experiences can be hard.” 

During a red carpet interview with IndieWire, Schafer, who makes for a haunting fashion girlie, emphasized the pleasurable aspect of the experience while still echoing her co-star's sentiments. “It was a lot of fun, and I think people are going to be mind-blown,” the “Euphoria” actor, who recently celebrated the release of “The Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,” said. “I was mind-blown.” 

 










Although as writer, director, and editor, Lowery — whose other film credits include “The Green Knight” and “The Old Man and the Gun” — was fully in control of the film, he also seems to have been disoriented by the experience. During a conversation at last year's Melbourne International Film Festival, where he spoke about taking a break from adapting stories to focus on original material, the director sounded as if he was compelled to make “Mother Mary” almost against his will. 

“I wrote the first 20 pages when I was shooting ‘Peter Pan and Wendy' and it's been percolating ever since,” Lowery said. “That movie was huge, it was one of the greatest shoots of my life and one of the hardest edits of my life and it inspired a lot of soul-searching. After that, I decided I'm just going to do something simple. I need to do a movie with just two actors in a room having a long heart-to-heart … a really gentle filmmaking experience.

“But then I thought, ‘What if one of those characters is a pop star? And what if we started at a stadium?' Then, it got bigger,” he continued. “And again, it wound up being the hardest thing I've ever done.” 

“Mother Mary” will release in April 2026 from A24. Watch the trailer below.

Adolescence director Philip Barantini has said “there is no sequel” to the Netflix global smash hit series.


	There has been much speculation about Season 2 of the one-shot drama, with the likes of PDede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner from Plan B Entertainment telling Deadline that they had spoken to Barantini about the “next iteration” of the show.


	In a talk about the British show's secret sauce at Content London today, Barantini, who co-created the show with star Stephen Graham, made his first comments about its future. As he described the making of the show and his positive experience on set, he poured cold water on a direct second season.

	“For me, it's about ultimately working with good people, nice people,” he said. “There is no sequel to this, but we as a collective want to continue to work together on multiple things,” he said. “We captured lightning in a bottle in terms of how we shot it, I but also the reach we had. That doesn't mean every project going forwards can't have the same ethos.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Barantini, Thorne and Warp producer Emily Feller appeared on stage to talk about the show. Graham was also billed to attend, but a filming clash meant he didn't appear.


	Barantini's It's All Made Up Productions co-produced the Emmy-winning Adolescence with Brad Pitt's Plan B and UK producer Warp Films, with prolific UK writer Jack Thorne also attached. 


	Thorne has previously said Season 2 would not happen as the story of troubled teenager Jamie, played by Emmy winner Owen Cooper, was complete, while Graham has made similar noises. However, speculation has remained as to whether it could still return.


	Following Adolescence‘s success, Boiling Point director Barantini is increasingly in demand. Last week, we revealed he and Netflix are working together to develop Jade Franks' one-woman play Eat the Rich (But Maybe Not Me Mates X) into a TV series. The streamer and the director are also pairing up for Hell Jumper, a feature film based on the 2024 documentary of the same name. We were also first with that news.

	











Adolescence, which made headlines for filming one continuous shot in each of its four episodes, follows the tragic story of a family whose teenage son, played by a debuting Cooper, is arrested and eventually jailed for the murder of a teenage girl. While the creators had assumed it would cut through with the British public, which was in the midst of a debate around incel culture and teen violence, it broke through globally and became one of Netflix's biggest original shows, surpassing Baby Reindeer as its most viewed UK title.


	Thorne, who has written the likes of This is England and Toxic Town, pointed the unexpected global success and posited the question as to whether Adolescence would have sold as territory-by-territory given it is set on a northern town and was addressing a particular debate in the UK.


	“If we were on Channel 4, we would have done well [in the UK], but I'd be interested whether we'd have sold abroad,” he said. “Would other countries have wanted to buy this show? My experience is the shows that don't sell are the one with regional accents, where it's about something particuarly British. I don't know if we would have got those international sales.”


	Thorne pointed to Mr Bates vs the Post Office, the ITV drama about the post office workers whose lives were destroyed by a faulty computer system, as an example of a critical British hit that did not shop globally. “ITV did very well and it did very in their slate through advertising. ITV Studios couldn't sell it across enough countries to turn a profit,” he said.


	Thorne also questioned the bravery of commissioners, claiming that many writers were failing to get shows made due to an over-reliance on crime programs.”Writers are being trapped in cul-de-sacs,” he said. “One thing Adolescence hasn't changed at all is that if you want to get a show away, you need a body in it and someone who is a bit sad investigating. 


	“When I was growing up, there were such a wide variety of shows on TV. I do think crime has taken hold… Writers with amazing leaps of imagination are being boxed into these places.”

Z
iz Lasota and Gwen Danielson had reached a stalemate. It was nighttime on the Caleb, the ancient steel-hulled tugboat where they had spent the last five months of 2017, anchored in the outer harbor of Pillar Point, 25 miles south of San Francisco. With their high cheekbones, dimpled chins, and penetrating gazes, the pair looked enough like siblings that strangers sometimes commented on their resemblance, but each could barely see the other in the pitch black that night, sitting on the floor of the boat's cramped control room.


	By her own account, Lasota was angry. Speaking into the dark, she remembers warning Danielson that “I would not at any point back down, and if [that] meant we were consigned to a runaway positive feedback loop of revenge, so be it … we might as well try to kill each other right then and there.” Then Lasota — who, at six foot two, stood five inches taller than Danielson — rose to her feet, silent, waiting for Danielson's reply.


	The rift in their relationship had started over money: It had cost more than expected to buy, fix up, and maintain the fleet of boats on which they hoped to eventually house a gang of brilliant programmers devoted to saving the world from an AI-engineered apocalypse.

	On top of the upfront costs, they were paying berthing fees for three boats, not including the Caleb. Anchoring their tugboat in the outer harbor, where there was no fee, was meant to give them breathing room, but instead it teed up expensive clashes with the United States Coast Guard (who believed their boat, loaded with thousands of gallons of diesel fuel, posed a threat to the environment), and a nearby fuel dock operator (who accused them of illegally accessing his equipment in the middle of the night to pump contaminated bilge water off the boat). After they were discovered doing that, they were ordered to hire a tanker truck to remove any remaining “hazardous fluids” from the tug. (Lasota did not respond to interview requests, and lawyers representing her in pending criminal cases declined to comment for this story. Accounts of these events are drawn from Lasota's and Danielson's blogs, relevant court documents, and interviews.)

	The pair eventually became so desperate for money that they even, against their convictions as devout vegans, registered the Caleb for the purposes of ferrying crabbers out to sea to drop their traps for cash — a period Lasota referred to on her blog as “our attempt to be brutal consequentialists.”


	When Danielson first pitched Lasota on the idea of bringing other similarly brainy, ambitious, cash-poor members of the Bay Area's Rationalist community together to live on boats, it felt like a revelation. Both had moved to the notoriously expensive enclave to be part of an elite intellectual community that considered itself the last best hope to save humanity from total annihilation by superhuman artificial intelligence. By living on the water, they figured they could stay close to that community, without slaving away at a soul-sucking corporate tech job just to afford rent. 


	Danielson, who is bigender, was already living on a 30-foot Bermuda Sloop called the Islander when they met Lasota. Both navigating the early stages of their respective gender transitions, the pair bonded instantly, and Lasota was captivated with Danielson's vision for a “Rationalist Fleet.” “Maybe following Gwen's crazy idea would be an answer to the problem where whatever I expect to try, I just expected it will be too slow for me to save the world,” Lasota wrote on her blog.


	Together, with a third Rationalist, they toured a series of boats of varying levels of seaworthiness: a moldy motorboat for $1,000, a liveaboard “with no working motor but a pretty decent interior” hawked by a guy with a swastika tattoo, a Coast Guard Cutter turned fishing vessel named Pacific Hunter, and a sailboat with cabins for six called The Rapture. (“I joked if we bought it we could refresh that paint, then cross it out, and write, ‘The Singularity,'” Lasota later wrote, referring to the hypothetical point at which artificial intelligence will outstrip human intelligence, and become self-improving — an event, some believe, which will quickly lead to human extinction.)

	In the end, they opted for a decommissioned Navy tugboat called the Caleb. With the help of a motley crew recruited via a Rationalist mailing list, in July 2017, they piloted the Caleb down the West Coast. Pillar Point wasn't supposed to be their final destination — Lasota and Danielson planned to head toward Benicia or somewhere along the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to start their housing project in earnest. But, under increasing financial pressure, and after a dispute with the boat's co-owner, they stopped at Pillar Point to think through their next steps. 

	











	Living without the burden of rent (on land, at least) was supposed to give Lasota and Danielson more time to devote to AI safety, but instead, in the months that followed, any time not consumed by boat crises, they spent talking — refining each other's speculative theories about the brain and the laws of the universe — and beginning to question whether the community they'd poured so much effort into was made up of the kind of people they once believed it to be.


	Later, Lasota and Danielson's disappointment would extend beyond the Rationalist community to two of its most hallowed institutions — the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) and the Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR). They would become increasingly disillusioned with both before stumbling upon information that torched any remaining faith they'd placed in either organization.


	But none of that had happened yet, the night on the Caleb, as Lasota towered over Danielson, challenging her closest friend to a fight to the death. In Lasota's mind, their disagreement was about more than just money. At one time, Danielson had been unanimously declared “dictator” of the Rationalist Fleet, but Lasota was starting to feel like she was spending all of her time talking Danielson through “mental upgrades,” and all of her resources fixing problems Danielson got them into.


	The challenge she issued that night was grounded in a theory she had begun refining on the boat. Lasota called it a “Timeless Gambit,” and she explained it as a way to shape shared “expectations in potential outcomes” — computations that “exist in multiple people's heads, and multiple places in time.” The underlying idea is that each decision you make does not just affect your immediate, physical future, it determines how others will treat you in all predictions, simulations, and parallel versions of that situation. If, for example, Danielson knew their actions would lead to Lasota escalating dramatically — challenging them to a fight to the death — another version of Danielson might have treated Lasota differently in the lead-up to their fight. In the years that followed, observers would come to recognize the contours of her theory in the baffling logic that accompanied a series of violent encounters around the country.


	On the Caleb, Lasota's gambit worked: Danielson stayed on the floor, assuring Lasota that they were not a threat and telling her that they would “rather be my number two than fight.” There was no altercation — no violence at all — only, according to Lasota, a quiet reshuffling of the dynamics of their relationship. 

	











	But their quarrel that night would have another downstream effect: Lasota's account of the dispute, memorialized on her blog, Sinceriously, was offered years later as evidence she was dangerous and should be cast out of the Rationalist community. “Ziz has taken more than one action that had a reasonable probability of causing fear of physical violence in those around her,” CFAR's president, Anna Salamon, wrote on Facebook, using the boat story as an example. Danielson argued that the scene was misused and misinterpreted, by Salamon and others, in an effort to portray Danielson as a victim of Ziz's abuse — a characterization Danielson strongly rejected.


	By that point, two years after the fight, some members of the community were becoming disconcerted by Lasota. Her presence, her writing, the way she dressed — in all black, often in long robes — made them uneasy. The final straw came in late 2019, after Lasota, Danielson, and two others were arrested while staging a protest at a reunion for alumni of CFAR's self-help workshops.


	Of those four protesters, today, one is dead, another is awaiting trial for her murder, a third disappeared, and the fourth — Lasota — is languishing in a county jail in Maryland, awaiting trial on unrelated charges. 


	At least five others who entered Lasota's orbit in the years that followed the protest are also dead or in jail: Two are accused of separate murders on opposite sides of the country, and two are persons of interest in a double homicide in Pennsylvania. Earlier this year, a fifth died in a shootout with the U.S. Border Patrol. As for the Caleb, it is rotting, half-sunk in the outer harbor at Pillar Point, abandoned, along with the dream of a Rationalist Fleet, years ago.


	TODAY, MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE FAMILIAR with the Rationalist community probably associate it with a handful of online spaces, the most prominent of which is LessWrong, a forum for people curious about cognitive bias and Bayesian reasoning, the practice of assigning mathematical probabilities to possible outcomes. It's the kind of place where one can find other people interested in the Paperclip Problem — the idea that a superhuman AI could be given a simple task like “maximize paper clip production” and end up destroying the world — or argue with effective altruists about “shrimp welfare,” the idea that shrimp are “moral patients” whose pain and suffering everyone should care about much more.

	











	But the online forum began with a much more specific mission: In 2003, a young Eliezer Yudkowsky was dreaming up an ambitious plan to recruit an army of individuals who would devote themselves to stopping superhuman AI from destroying its human creators.


	“I think I may have to split my attention one more time, hopefully the last, and write something to attract the people we need. My current thought is a book on the underlying theory and specific human practice of rationality… I don't think we'll find the people we need by posting a job opening. Movements often start around books; we don't have our book yet,” he wrote in an email to a Silicon Valley listserv.


	Yudkowsky, an autodidact who dropped out of school in the eighth grade, had been captivated by the idea of the Singularity since he first ran across the concept as a teen reading sci-fi author Vernor Vinge's short story collection True Names and Other Dangers. By age 21, he had co-founded the nonprofit Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence, or SIAI. Yudkowsky, the institute's sole employee, was determined to build machine superintelligence himself — before eventually recognizing all the ways that could go wrong and devoting himself to AI alignment (working to ensure that artificial intelligence shares humans' values and priorities) instead.


	“It was obviously the most important thing going on,” Yudkowsky explained to Rolling Stone in 2023, “and the things that would, like, determine the fate of the galaxy and all that.”


	In order to succeed, Yudkowsky knew he would need a lot more people — a lot more of a certain kind of person — to join his cause. After sending that 2003 email, he set to work on a series of lengthy essays about overcoming one's own inherent cognitive biases. (The logic was simple, as one ex-Rationalist put it, “Yud tried to talk to people about AI, and they disagreed with him, and he concluded they were insane and needed to learn how to think better.”) 


	The collection was called The Sequences and it, in turn, drew people to LessWrong, the forum Yudkowsky started and would later identify as “a key venue for SIAI recruitment.” He followed The Sequences up with a second opus: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, a 660,000-word J.K. Rowling-inspired fan fiction about a young wizard whose real superpower is his cool, rational mind. Both works revolve around the same core idea: that brains are systematically irrational, but there are ways to train yours to think better.

	











	His plan worked. Droves of readers — young, brainy high achievers who wanted to make a difference in the world — read The Sequences or the Potter fan fic, and many came to Berkeley to work or volunteer at two organizations, both spun out of Yudkowsky's original think tank: The Machine Intelligence Research Institute, or MIRI, devoted to the technical research needed to develop friendly AI, and the Center for Applied Rationality, or CFAR, devoted to the broader goal of helping people become more rational so they would take the threat of artificial intelligence more seriously.


	“He spun this grand tale of adventure and great danger … Here's this great mathematical evil, and we have to beat it by being better at math — and to me, that was very seductive,” says Qiaochu Yuan, a young math prodigy and MIT graduate who moved to the Bay Area and got involved with CFAR after reading Yudkowsky. “I was like, ‘Wow, that sounds really nice. I would love to be a big-shot hero and save the world with the power of math.'”


	Lasota and Danielson were among them, too. Both dropped out of school — Danielson abandoning an academic scholarship at Rice University, Lasota leaving graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign — and moved to the Bay Area convinced by Yudkowsky's argument the Singularity was coming, that it would almost certainly spell doom for life on Earth, and that the only way to stop it was if enough intellectually-gifted individuals banded together to find a solution in time.


	LASOTA GREW UP THE ELDEST OF THREE children in a house in the woods outside Fairbanks, Alaska. Her father, Dan, had been a physics and astronomy major at the University of Rochester where he worked at the university's Mees Observatory. Her mother, Kate, graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the same college with a degree in integrated sciences.


	In 1988, the fall after Kate graduated, the couple, already married, moved to Alaska, where Dan, an early computer wiz, taught Introduction to Macintosh Computers to community college students at a University of Alaska, Fairbanks campus. He went on to work in several computer systems roles for government research organizations, before starting his own database company in 1998.


	Today, Dan is an instructional designer at the University of Fairbanks, where he was described in a staff spotlight as “our go-to person for all things related to research on AI in education,” and a devotee of games like Dungeons and Dragons and Civilization 6. 

	











	All three of his children studied at the university — including Ziz, a University Honors Scholar who graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in computer science in 2013. (Dan and Kate did not respond to interview requests.)


	Ziz struggled as a child with behavioral issues that her parents, one family member tells me, seemed to attribute to boredom from not being intellectually challenged by her coursework: “They would say that the teachers in the system didn't know how to educate [her].”


	But she shared her father's interest in astronomy and video games. As a college student, she interned at NASA, where she helped design a tool to measure ejections of plasma from the sun's atmosphere, and later developed a video game of her own.


	In college, she also spent a lot of time watching videos on the internet, which she later described on her blog as “hour for hour, one of the most valuable things I've ever done.” At first it was videos of evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins or the author Christopher Hitchens in debates about atheism. She went on to mainline philosophy vlogs, becoming obsessed with the study of ethics.


	“I wanted to know what everyone would do in the trolley problem,” Lasota wrote, referring to the famous quandary that ponders whether it is more ethical to allow the tram to remain on a collision course where it would kill five people, or to intervene, diverting the trolley to kill just one person. “This led to me becoming a vegetarian, then a vegan.” One day, she was on an online philosophy forum when she stumbled on Yudkowsky's Sequences and, in turn, “the most important problem in the world”: the Singularity. Still a college student, she began donating to MIRI, convinced that “our survival, the survival of sentient life, depends on it.” 


	By 2016, the year Lasota and Danielson arrived in the Bay Area, a vibrant community had taken root in the East Bay, where Rationalists lived in group houses and interrogated each other's patterns of thinking at CFAR workshops and weekly LessWrong meetups. There were parties and cuddle puddles — yes, piles of cuddling humans — and a wealth of people who had been conditioned to apply Bayesian principles to every decision they made. 


	The community also had a surprisingly high proportion of members who identify as trans or gender fluid. There is no consensus on why that is. According to a recent LessWrong community survey, the number of respondents who considered themselves trans, nonbinary, or otherwise gender nonconforming more than doubled the number of cis-women. (Cis-men vastly outnumber both, making up roughly 80 percent of respondents.) Some speculate that Rationalists, obsessed with correcting their own cognitive biases, might be more open-minded about gender identity than the general population; others suggested a shared interest in transhumanism — harnessing technology to extend life and enhance the corporeal experience — could be a factor.

	











	In many ways, the scene that greeted them when they arrived in the Bay Area didn't match their expectations. Danielson wrote on their blog about being disappointed in meeting so many people who had also read Yudkowsky's writing, but who had not come away with the same sense of purpose they had. 


	After a board game night hosted by the South Bay LessWrong chapter, they wrote: “There wasn't anybody besides me who didn't want to play board games but wanted to discuss strategy for saving the world, or rationality tech development, or AI alignment research … Where are the people working on saving the world? How/why are these people orienting towards these bizarre topics, even after reading The Sequences? Why is everyone committing slow-motion mass suicide after being told that's what's going on and info about the path out?”


	Lasota struggled, too. She had originally moved to the Bay Area determined to fulfill what she had come to believe was her destiny: scoring a lucrative tech job, then “earning to give” — donating the lion's share of her salary — to support MIRI's work. Doing so, she wrote, was “one of my main guesses about how I could best contribute to saving the world.” 


	That dream quickly ran up against the fact that she did not function well in the punishing conditions startups demanded. She writes that she was fired twice for refusing to work more than eight hours a day. Without a steady income, she borrowed from her parents and bounced between Airbnbs in increasingly far-flung corners of the Bay Area, spending her money on rideshares to rationalist meetups. It was at one of these, in Berkeley, where she met Danielson.


	They connected instantly: That night, Lasota later remembered on her blog, Danielson brought her back to their sailboat, where they showed Lasota a dragon-shaped necklace and confided that they were an otherkin — someone who identifies as nonhuman, in their case, specifically, a dragon.


	The pair became close. Lasota moved onto Danielson's boat, where they talked, Lasota wrote, “for several hours a day. About transness, about neuroscience, about their old crazy plans to save the world (breed superintelligent dogs) … About my mental tech I wrote about on my blog. About my (much cruder back then) theories of human morality.”


	For both of them, connecting with another trans person in the community felt good. Lasota had some ugly experiences after relocating to the Bay Area. At Liminal, a Rationalist group house where she briefly crashed, she wrote that after she was introduced as a non-transitioning trans woman — she took hormones, but had decided against pursuing a transition surgically or legally — one roommate “looked at me with something like disgust and asked when I'd be leaving.” At a CFAR workshop, she remembered a conversation where her interlocutor “poked at my transness, in ways that suggested they thought I was a delusional man.” At a LessWrong meetup, a man tried to convince her that she was an “autogynephile” — a straight man with a sexual fetish imaging himself as a woman.

	











	Lasota was also forced to reckon with the belief — advanced by some figures in the Rationalist movement — that transitioning was a bad idea because it would make her a less “effective” agent in the AI safety movement. She seemed to have internalized the idea that transitioning “would interfere with my ability to make money due to discrimination, and destroy too great a chunk of my tiny probability of saving the world.” She even, as Rationalists do, assigned a figure to the reduction in expected impact she would have if she did transition, pegging it at somewhere between 10 and 40 percent.


	On the boat, Lasota hashed out these frustrations and more with Danielson. By this time, she'd adopted the name Ziz (a beautiful and terrifying world destroyer from Worm, a webcomic popular with Rationalists), began wearing dark robes (a symbol of “nonsubmission”), and identifying, religiously, as a “Sith” —  rivals to the Jedi order in Star Wars. “The Sith do what they want deep down. They remove all obstructions to that and express their true values,” she wrote on her blog. (Siths, Star Wars fans may recall, also destroy their masters.)


	Danielson was struggling, too. They had, by this time, become convinced that CFAR discriminated against them on the basis of their gender identity. According to Danielson's account, they had volunteered at the first of a series of CFAR workshops in early 2017, before beginning their transition. They write that they asked to volunteer for the remaining sessions after they began presenting as female, but they were told the volunteer slots had been filled. “I was excluded from what I had been led to understand was the hiring pipeline for CFAR,” Danielson wrote. (CFAR's Anna Salamon did not respond to a request for comment.)


	In January 2019, Michael Vassar, the former president of MIRI, met with Lasota and Danielson in hopes, according to one person present, of dissuading them from suing CFAR for gender discrimination. Neither mention a potential lawsuit in any of their writings, and no suit was ever filed, but over the course of their conversation with Vassar, they learned a critical piece of information: that MIRI had reached a settlement with a former employee who had waged a protracted campaign to smear the organization as a “cult” and a ”pedophile ring.”


	The revelation shocked Lasota and Danielson to their cores. (“THEY PAID THAT FUCKER?!” Lasota remembered shouting when she heard.) She was stunned that the organization she'd placed so much faith in would use money she'd donated — the little money she and her friends had — not for time-sensitive, potentially world-saving research, but to pay off a disgruntled employee.

	











	Beyond the feeling of betrayal, there was something else that irked Lasota: the idea that an organization that staked so much of its credibility on sound decision-making would make the fundamentally unsound decision of paying what Lasota viewed as blackmail. 


	Lasota and Danielson decided to air their grievances against both CFAR and MIRI at one of the largest annual gatherings of Rationalists: the CFAR alumni reunion, scheduled to take place in November 2019 in Northern California. 


	The reunion gave attendees the chance to give presentations on any subject of their choosing. Two years earlier, in 2017, Danielson, Lasota, and Dan Powell, the other part-owner of the Caleb, had attended the reunion and given a talk about their plans for the Rationalist Fleet. This time around, Danielson explained on her blog, “I spent several weeks preparing a series of talks and discussion groups that I thought had the best chance of communicating the base information, our models, how to perceive deep aspects of their own and others' psychologies and ethics, and how to escape traps like the Bay area housing market.”


	Lasota and two other acquaintances, both transwomen in the Rationalist scene — Somni Leatham and Emma Borhanian — planned to give their own talks that were similarly critical of MIRI, CFAR, and the Rationalist community. 


	But, according to Danielson's blog, CFAR leadership interceded, telling Lasota and Danielson they were not welcome at the event after seeing a series of Discord posts by Lasota that they deemed threatening. 


	So, instead, they decided to stage a protest.


	LASOTA, DANIELSON, BORHANIAN, AND LEATHAM ARRIVED at Westminster Woods, the redwood-shaded Sonoma County retreat center where CFAR planned to hold its alumni reunion, on the afternoon of Nov. 15, 2019, shortly before the event was scheduled to begin. They wore long dark robes, according to a police report that would be filed later that day, along with black latex gloves, black silicone shoe covers, white Guy Fawkes masks, body cameras, and two-way radios.


	When deputies from the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office arrived, three protesters stood at the entrance to the retreat center, proffering leaflets. The flyers, which quoted Yudkowsky's Sequences, also declared it was time “to process what happened to MIRI, CFAR, and the rationality community. It is not what it once seemed like it would become. New things can be built.”


	The papers also criticized MIRI's decision to settle with the disgruntled employee — a decision which, in their view, made the organization “super exploitable.” Because of it, virtually anyone could “use MIRI & CFAR as their personal bank and tell them what to do instead of anticipating that they wouldn't pay out.”


	“It's easy to see this is incorrect if you are thinking with tdt” — Timeless Decision Theory — the flyer read.


	Timeless Decision Theory is a framework Yudkowsky came up with in 2010. The easiest way to explain it is through a famous thought experiment called Newcomb's Problem: an all-knowing predictor presents you with two boxes. The first box, which is transparent, has $1,000 inside, the other, which is opaque, has either $1 million or nothing. You have to decide whether to take both boxes, or only the second. The catch is: If the predictor predicts you will choose both boxes, the second box will be empty, but if it predicts you'll only choose box two, box two will contain $1 million. One school of thought — Causal Decision Theory —  says to choose both boxes because the boxes are already filled, and your decision can't change the past. With his own theory, Yudkowsky posited the opposite: If you choose box two, box two will have a $1 million, because the all-knowing predictor — armed with perfect knowledge of your decision-making — has already guessed that you are the type of person who would take box two.

	











	The idea is that your decisions don't just determine your immediate future — they also determine what copies or simulations of you would do under the same conditions across time and space. 


	MIRI, in the protesters' view, had failed this type of test: The organization would never have been “blackmailed” if it wasn't already the type of organization that could be “blackmailed” in the first place. But because it was, every assumption anyone ever made about MIRI — and its potential to save the world — needed to be reconsidered.


	The four strangely dressed figures had parked vehicles — a white Ford Econoline box truck and mini school bus — across the camp's entrances and exits. They refused to speak with retreat center staff, who called the sheriff's office, speculating that one of the protesters might have a gun. None did, but a SWAT team swarmed the camp, a bomb squad was called in, and at least one police helicopter was dispatched to the scene. The protesters were quickly and forcibly arrested; as they were being wrestled to the ground, both Lasota and Danielson screamed that they were being sexually assaulted.


	Aella, a popular Substack author and cam girl, was among those planning to attend the reunion that weekend. When she arrived and saw police lights, at first she thought there'd been a car accident, but soon news of the protest and the police response spread on group chats and email listservs, and everyone who was supposed to be arriving for the retreat ended up at a café 10 minutes down the road. 


	Aella figured it was par for the course. “This just happens,” she remembers thinking. “You just get insane people sometimes. If you're a big enough community, it's inevitable that you get a few people. And there have been a few people, besides the Zizians, who have sort of gone insane.” 


	But there was at least one person present that day to whom the protesters did not seem insane: a young Berkeley graduate named Daniel Blank, who carpooled to the retreat with other CFAR alums, and watched through the trees as deputies approached Lasota and her friends. (Neither Blank nor his lawyer responded to a request for comment.) 

	











	“He was very upset by the whole thing,” a friend who was present recalls. The protesters' allegations against MIRI and CFAR — and more so the way that everyone seemed to be shrugging them off — unnerved Blank. “He seemed confused, like, ‘How do we know they're not right?'”


	The night before, roughly 500 people — mostly alumni of past CFAR workshops, including Blank — received an email accusing CFAR and its sister organization, MIRI, of a litany of offenses, but above all abandoning their founding mission.

MIRI paid out to blackmail over statutory rape. Theft of donor funds to deceive donors.

MIRI and CFAR started out as SIAI, an organization once functional enough to halt and pivot to AI alignment from accelerationism. They rotted…


If you do not want to die with this plague consuming our world, then turn your hopes back to the hard-to-define things that generated these institutions that no longer deserve them.


	Blank's friends recall trying to break the incident down the way they'd learned to at CFAR workshops, demonstrating how the protesters had failed to act rationally. But Blank, described by one friend as “both brilliant and also incredibly naive,” did not seem entirely convinced.


	BEFORE THE PROTEST, LASOTA WROTE a second email, this one addressed specifically to Yudkowsky. (Danielson was cc'd.) In it, she invoked allegations spread by a disgruntled ex-MIRI employee that Yudkowsky had committed statuatory rape, and she further accused him of starting an AI arms race that would exterminate life on Earth.


	The first set of allegations have been investigated and deemed baseless. They stem from a report filed by a onetime MIRI employee named Louie Helm who claimed a teenager was “being exploited” by a group of men, including Yudkowsky, who ran a local youth camp — referring to the Summer Program for Applied Rationality and Cognition, hosted by CFAR.


	According to the sealed police report obtained by Rolling Stone, Helm accused Yudkowsky of having a sexual relationship with a then-18-year-old that began at least two and half years prior. 

	











	Officers were dispatched to Yudkowsky's home, which, at the time, he shared with the 18-year-old in question. The “alleged victim,” officers wrote in the report, stressed that they “lived in a happy and safe environment.” That person later transitioned; today, he lives with his wife, whom he met in Berkeley's Rationalist scene, and their two young children. When I spoke to him earlier this year, he told me he rejects the notion that he was exploited by anyone other than Helm, the disgruntled employee, whom he felt used him as ammunition against Yudkowsky and MIRI. “I was expedient,” he says. 


	After Rolling Stone reached out to Yudkowsky for comment, he posted a lengthy response on X denying Helm's allegation, and writing, “To the best of my knowledge, I have never in my life had sex with anyone under the age of 18. I have not had sex, at all, with the particular person the Ziz cult thinks I had sex with, whom I am not naming here for reasons of their own privacy.” Helm did not respond to a request for comment. 


	Lasota was said to be sensitive to abuse concerns — one friend of Borhanian's tells me that “one of the reasons that she was so close to Ziz was that she was incredibly grateful to Ziz for helping her get out of an abusive relationship. It made her feel seen and accepted.” (Both Borhanian and Leatham lived in a group house called Guilt with a roommate who, they alleged, would regularly beat Borhanian with a bamboo stick. The roommate could not be reached for comment.)


	On her own blog, Lasota claimed she was “molested” by her grandfather, whom she called a “pedophile.” Robert Lasota, Dan's father and Ziz's grandfather, was convicted in late 1980s of molesting his daughter, but that conviction was later thrown out, and the case was retried, unsuccessfully, twice. (Reached by Rolling Stone, Lasota's grandparents strenuously denied Ziz's allegation.)


	Lasota's second accusation — that Yudkowsky started an AI arms race — referred to an uncomfortable truth: that Yudkowsky, despite his ceaseless warnings about the threat posed by AI, has arguably done more than any other person alive to hasten the acceleration of artificial intelligence technology.


	In 2005, shortly after he began working on The Sequences, Yudkowsky was introduced to Peter Thiel — the co-founder of PayPal and Palantir — at a dinner party in San Francisco. Thiel took an interest in his work and began funding Yudkowsky's Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and together, with famed computer scientist Ray Kurzweil, they created an annual conference, the Singularity Summit, at Stanford University. (Jeffrey Epstein was another early supporter of SIAI; he gave $50,000 through his own foundation in 2009.)


	The founders of the AI lab DeepMind persuaded Thiel to fund their startup, later purchased by Google, at the Singularity Summit. DeepMind's early success, in turn, impressed a young Thiel acolyte, Sam Altman, who went on to co-found Open AI with Elon Musk, a MIRI backer (and, apparently, a LessWrong reader — he connected with the singer Grimes after they made the same joke about a popular LessWrong thought experiment called “Roko's Basilisk”). Altman has credited Yudkowsky with sparking his pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence — artificial intelligence that is as smart as, or smarter, than humans.

	











	Many of the young readers who flocked to the Bay Area after reading Yudkowsky's work eventually went into the field of AI, too: Today, a notable share of the people Lasota emailed the night before the CFAR reunion are employed by the biggest firms developing artificial intelligence technology, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and DeepMind.


	In her message to Yudkowsky, Lasota invoked an epic battle of the kind that he had once promised his young readers: 


Our civilization is doing an unending holocaust, birth to death to 


many billions of sentient beings per year. That's what kind of 


morality you import when you import code from the system… 


We will not just sit on our hands and let you or your masters, or 


their god-Cancer conquer the world… We will exercise self defense, 


and we will defend each other, and we will defend sentient life...


And I stake my soul, and much more importantly the multiverse on justice 


without compromise or concession… If you want to make it out of this universe 


alive, I suggest you do the same.


Come clean, and we may talk of what can be done to pick up the pieces.












	The missive was signed:


Sinceriously,


Darth Ziz


(Interim de facto leader of the vegan Sith.)


	Lasota and Danielson remained convinced by Yudkowsky's warning of the dire threat posed by artificial intelligence. But where Yudkowsky's fear had revolved around the existential threat AI posed to mankind, the vegan Sith — which at that point, consisted only of Lasota and Danielson — recommitted with a fierce moral urgency to the cause of protecting all sentient life.  


	INSTEAD OF RALLYING THRONGS OF RATIONALISTS against MIRI and CFAR, the protest only seemed to drive Lasota and Danielson further to the fringes of the community. By December 2019, both had been banned from LessWrong after attempting to post their grievances about CFAR and MIRI there. A Facebook group called Bay Area Rationalist Community Safety Discussion sprung up, where the protest, and Lasota's role in it specifically, was dissected; Lasota was not allowed in the group, and Danielson complained that her own posts defending her friend were censored by moderators. They were booted from the MIRIx Discord server, banned from meetups for Slate Star Codex (another Rationalist forum) and unwelcome at REACH — the Rationalist and Effective Altruist Community Hub — a community space in Oakland.


	Most consequentially, a website, Zizians.info, appeared online, declaring Lasota the leader of a “peculiar online cult” that the site's author christened the “Zizians.” Earlier this year, as reporters puzzled over a string of murders allegedly committed by individuals in Lasota's orbit, the site was treated as an authority on the subject, the claims repeated uncritically in several stories. (Lasota, for her part, blasted the site's contents as “not just distortions but several jailbroken, outright lies” when it materialized in early 2020. She rejected most fiercely the author's assertion that she played any role in encouraging the suicides of two close friends.)


	The police response to the protest, and perhaps more so the reaction from the Rationalist community, had a profound impact on Lasota who, according to those who knew her, grew more pessimistic about humanity and the idea of redemption afterward. 


	Still facing a pile of fines and bills over the failures to maintain the Caleb, Lasota and Danielson were now being forced to pay, along with Leatham and Borhanian, for their legal defense in separate cases spawned by the protest. First there was the criminal case — all four were charged with conspiracy, trespassing, wearing a mask for an unlawful purpose, resisting arrest, false imprisonment, and child endangerment, the last charge added to account for the “emotional and mental suffering” of a class of school children at the retreat center that day — then a countersuit, filed by the protesters, alleging mistreatment at the hands of the sheriff's office during their arrest and detention.


	To remain close to their lawyers and the courthouse, the four of them stayed together in a series of Airbnbs near Santa Rosa. Daniel Blank, the young Rationalist who watched their protest from the highway, volunteered to serve as the foursome's process server, delivering paperwork to witnesses and a judge they sought to disqualify from the case. But soon they were banned from Airbnb, too. A host apparently recognized them from a newspaper article about the protest and contacted the platform, which revoked Borhanian's account for violating its terms of service.


	Not long after that, Lasota, Danielson, Leatham, and Borhanian moved onto a dusty lot at the end of a cul-de-sac in Vallejo, California, crowded with RVs and shipping containers, and owned by a man named Curtis Lind.


	LASOTA AND DANIELSON FIRST MET LIND when they pulled the Caleb up to the Pillar Point dock one day to refuel. Lind walked over and introduced himself as the owner of the Robert Gray, a 1932 Army Corps survey vessel. “I got to be pretty friendly with some of them — friendly enough so that I took one of them to a Walmart to buy [their] first bra,” Lind later told a documentary crew with NuReality Productions, who interviewed the octogenarian for an unrelated film project.

	











	When Lind sold his boat and moved onto the property he owned in Vallejo, Lasota and Danielson asked to join him. They had a new concept: Instead of boats, they would buy and outfit small, U-Haul-style box trucks. They called them “Slackmobiles” in reference to the idea of acquiring “slack” — sufficient surplus resources — to do things beyond simply struggling to survive. The ideological heir to the Rationalist Fleet, Slackmobiles were a way to recapture “mental and logistical autonomy,” Danielson wrote. 


	Owning a Slackmobile, Danielson wrote in 2020, had the added advantage of insulating them from the kind of “civilizational decay and collapse” Danielson estimated had 75 percent probability of occurring by 2025.


	Borhanian was especially passionate about Danielson's idea, one person who knew her tells me. The former Google software engineer believed if she could figure out a straightforward and scalable way to build Slackmobiles or teach others how to do it, the information could effectively prevent the best and brightest from being funneled into corporate jobs where they would ultimately burn out. If a person had slack, Borhanian believed, the time they might spend working to afford rent could be used for something more productive like AI safety, or advocating for the welfare of all sentient beings. 


	As they began to outfit their box trucks and RVs on Lind's lot in early 2020, their rent and expenses were mostly covered by Bitcoin, in which Borhanian and Leatham were both heavily invested, as well as savings Lasota had squirreled away during her time working at Google in 2018. Just as Bitcoin crashed in March 2020, and the group lost its ability to pay rent, they were offered some cosmic slack of their own: Because of the pandemic, the state of California placed a temporary moratorium on evictions. Soon after protections went into effect, Lind said, Lasota and the others stopped paying him.  


	In April of that year, Danielson's then-lawyer told the court that his client had disappeared; he heard they may have died by suicide. His repeated calls to Danielson went unanswered, he wrote, before the number was disconnected. Then, in August — the month after the moratorium on evictions ended — Lasota was reported missing, too, also presumed dead. 


	According to documents later filed in San Mateo District Court, on the afternoon of Aug. 19, 2022, Lasota had taken Borhanian and her youngest sister, Naomi Lasota, out “for an afternoon on the water” aboard the Black Cygnet, the small sailboat she purchased before the Caleb. Around 11 p.m., as the three headed back toward the marina, Lasota fell off the back of the boat and into the bay, according to Borhanian.

	











	“I lost sight of [Lasota] while looking for a life preserver,” Borhanian wrote in a petition intended to officially establish Lasota's death. The pair called the Coast Guard, which mounted an exhaustive search effort — involving a helicopter, a drone, and several boats — before it was called off, unsuccessful. 


	Lasota's parents placed an obituary in their hometown newspaper, remembering her love for “adventure, friends, and family, music, blueberries, biking, computer games, and animals.” 


	Dan Kapelovitz, the lawyer representing Lasota in the ongoing criminal case over the CFAR reunion protest, was still fighting for footage of her arrest when he received the news. He notified the court of Lasota's apparent death and formally requested to be let off the case, which he believes would eventually have been dropped. (“The government had an extremely weak case,” he tells me.) 


	Just a few months after Kapelovitz lodged his request, he received an email from the district attorney in Vallejo, informing him that his client was, in fact, alive.


	IN THE FALL OF 2022, APPARENTLY UNAWARE of the legal efforts to declare Lasota legally dead, Lind had sought a court order to formally evict her, Danielson, Borhanian, plus 18 other named residents and “all unknown occupants” whom, Lind alleged, owed him more than $60,000 back rent, damages, and other costs. Lind was granted a judgment against his tenants on Oct. 27 of that year.  Among those unknown occupants was an individual later named in court documents as Suri Dao, a former National Merit Scholar who identified as bigender and was estranged from their parents.


	Two and half weeks later — two days before the Solano County Sheriff was reportedly set to evict them — Dao approached Lind asking for help, he later said. There was a leak in Dao's trailer, and they didn't know how to turn the water off. According to Lind's account of the events, he was bending over outside Dao's trailer when he was hit on the back of the head.


	“The right hand side of my skull was shattered. My nose was shoved over flat,” Lind said in the unpublished video footage. He managed to get to his feet and pull out the gun he said he began wearing after Borhanian flashed a knife at him a few weeks earlier. Standing around him were Dao, Borhanian, and Leatham. Lind shot Borhanian fatally, then fired several rounds at Leatham before running out of ammunition.

	











	“I was bleeding from numerous puncture wounds — I think around 50. I couldn't see out of my right eye — had been punctured three times. The back of my neck had some severe cuts, like somebody was trying to cut my head off … Oh, and I had a sword, a long sword, all the way through my chest, right next to my heart, sticking out the other end,” Lind later said. The samurai sword was still sticking through his chest when he banged on the door of another tenant's nearby RV, telling him, “I'm dying.”


	Leatham and Dao were arrested that day and charged with aggravated mayhem, the attempted murder of Lind, as well as Borhanian's murder, under a California law that allows for a person to be charged if they provoke another person to kill. 


	At least one person blamed the Rationalist community's treatment of Lasota and her friends for the tragedy: In April 2023, an acquaintance, Octavia Nouzen — who claims to have helped author Zizians.info — wrote, “Emma is dead because we all called her and her friends a cult so much that they couldn't find anywhere to live” other than Lind's lot.


	A few days after Lind's stabbing, Lasota's former lawyer Dan Kapelovitz received an email from a deputy district attorney in Sonoma County.


	“I just wanted to reach out and let you know Lasota was contacted by police in Vallejo this weekend (Leatham was involved in an attack and was charged with attempted murder). Lasota was on scene, alive and well,” the deputy DA wrote.


	Lasota, according to reporting by the San Francisco Chronicle, had been handcuffed at gunpoint at the scene and taken to Vallejo police headquarters, “where a homicide investigator said she faked a medical emergency and was taken by ambulance to a hospital,” from which she later disappeared.

	











	THE NEXT TIME LASOTA APPEARED on law enforcement radar was two months later, on Jan. 12, 2023, at an airport hotel on the outskirts of Philadelphia. State police had come to Candlewood Suites to serve a warrant in connection with an investigation into the murders of Rita and Richard Zajko, the parents of a young Rationalist known to friends as Jamie. The couple was shot in their home two weeks earlier, on New Year's Eve — their child's 30th birthday.


	Police arrived at the hotel hoping to retrieve a 9 mm Smith & Wesson MP and a DNA sample belonging to Jamie Zajko. As Zajko, who is nonbinary, was being escorted by police out of the motel, they shouted to hotel staff to notify Zajiko's travel companion, Daniel Blank, that they had been detained. Blank, the young vegan Rationalist who watched the CFAR protest and later assisted the four during their legal troubles, had cut off contact with his own family a month earlier.


	Zajko, who had a masters degree in bioinformatics, was originally drawn into LessWrong after reading Yudkowsky's Harry Potter fan fiction. After college, they moved to the Bay Area where they interned at NASA and lived in the same group house, Guilt, with Borhanian, Leatham, and the roommate they accused of abuse. According to Danielson, they mounted an effort with Borhanian in 2019 to “get Jamie out” of their abusive living situation — even offering help to build a Slackmobile where they could live. 


	Their efforts failed, but they left a lasting impression on Zajko. “One of the last times I heard from Jamie, [they] told us a bit about [their] living in an RV by [themself] on that piece of land [they] bought,” a friend who knew Zajko from a LessWrong study group, tells me. Three years later, in August 2021, Zajko wrote on Tumblr about their decision to build a Slackmobile, an effort they say began in earnest “after I noticed the extent of my complicity with the animal murder industry.” That post was liked by Daniel Blank.


	A few weeks before he stopped speaking to his family, Blank, a Berkeley graduate and a beloved member of the Bay Area Rationalist community, known for his brilliance and generosity, posted on his own Tumblr: “I don't know if this is the sort of thing posted here, or if it'll get any response, but: I have been told that (and it seems accurate that) I am bad at coming up with strategies from scratch, and tend to follow whatever opportunities to do good come my way instead. Since I would like to devote my life to the truth, life, and agency of all sentient beings, and am largely lost on how to do so, has anyone any advice?”


	Before he dropped off radar, a friend from the Rationalist community tells me Blank “seemed to be successively joining various vegan groups and then being disappointed in the lack of efficacy.” The friend, an effective altruist, recalls that in her final conversation with Blank, “I tried to walk him into incrementalism, but I still worry that I was counterproductive. I said, ‘What are you going to do? Wage war on the non-vegan singlehandedly? You need to have a clear path to impact.' But I think that what he heard is, ‘You should wage war on the non-vegans singlehandedly.'”


	The last message Blank's parents received from him was a graphic video of animals being slaughtered. “Look what you've done,” he wrote, according to reporting from the news site VT Digger.

	











	The state troopers who detained Zajko in Pennsylvania knew Blank as Zajko's roommate — they had interviewed both of them about the Zajko murders a week earlier at the house where the pair were living in Vermont.


	When they learned — after Zajko called out to the hotel staff — that Blank was also in the hotel, they got a second search warrant — for the same gun and Blank's DNA — and forced their way into his room. They were surprised to find two people inside: Blank and another person, this one laying on the bathroom floor, unresponsive: Ziz Lasota.


	The trooper, using male pronouns for Lasota, later described the scene in court: “He had his eyes closed. He would not speak. He was just laying almost unconscious or as if he was dead on the ground.” It would eventually take “four or five” officers to carry Lasota out of the hotel room. “Just the weight of carrying a limp body is not easy,” the trooper said. Lasota, who police eventually managed with some difficulty to fingerprint, was charged with disorderly conduct and obstructing or hindering police. She was held on those charges in Pennsylvania for months, her bail set at $500,000.


	Lasota finally posted a reduced bail in June 2023. When she failed to show up at court that December, a judge issued a bench warrant for her arrest. By then, Zajko and Blank had returned to Vermont. Lasota and two others — Teresa Youngblut, a young HPMoR fan from Washington who adopted the name “Milo,” and a German quant trader called Ophelia Bauckholt, both vegans who were active in online Rationalist communities — were reportedly living together in an Airbnb in North Carolina. A little more than a year would pass, before violence would explode again — on opposite ends of the country, just a few days apart.


	On Jan. 20, 2025, Youngblut and Bauckholt were in Vermont, looking to purchase property, when they were pulled over by Border Patrol for an immigration check. (Bauckholt was in the U.S. on an H1-B visa, reserved for highly skilled workers.) According to a federal indictment, both the driver and passenger exited the vehicle and opened fire on the federal agents. One Border Patrol officer, David Maland, was killed in the firefight, as was Bauckholt. Youngblut was hospitalized and later charged with Maland's murder. Their guns, investigators would later learn, were purchased by Zajko.


	Three days earlier, on the other side of the country, just as the cases against Leatham and Suri Dao were preparing to go to trial, Curtis Lind — the key witness in those trials — was attacked again, this time fatally. Lind was approached and stabbed in the chest by a figure in a beanie and mask. A 22-year-old former Oxford student named Maximillian Snyder was arrested and charged with Lind's murder. Snyder, a Yudkowsky reader, had once been awarded an $11,000 AI Alignment research prize in a contest judged by MIRI's president and, records show, he had applied for a marriage license with Youngblut one month earlier. 

	











	Contacted in jail by a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle two weeks after his arrest, Snyder agreed to dictate an open letter over the phone: It was addressed to Yudkowsky, imploring him to go vegan. 


	Four weeks after that, Maryland State Police approached a pair of box trucks parked on an unpaved road near Frostburg, Maryland. In the cab of one of the trucks, State Trooper Brandon Jeffries would later recall in court records obtained by Rolling Stone, he found a young man dressed all in black: Daniel Blank. The windows of the second truck were fogged over, but when Jeffries unlatched the back door, he discovered two others, similarly clad in black and wearing holsters stocked with guns and ammunition: Lasota and Zajko. The trucks were registered to Youngblut. 


	TO PEOPLE WHO KNEW LASOTA AND the others, the seemingly inexplicable series of attacks that took place after they were pushed out of the Rationalist community fit within a common understanding.


	“The core thing motivating a lot of what they were doing was looking at the horrors of factory farming and being unwilling to accept it,” a friend explains. They were convinced “anybody who could tolerate this is a monster.” But there was another aspect, too: They believed “making it stop isn't enough. We need to make it not have happened in the first place.”


	According to Lasota's interpretation of Timeless Decision Theory, it is possible to “collapse the timeline” — making it so that certain events “never happened” at all. As one person puts it, the logic boils down to: “If you punish the people who do a bad thing hard enough, then there won't have been any incentive for them to do it in the first place, and therefore they won't have done it at all, in any alternate timeline.”

	











	This, people who knew Lasota suspect, is the ideology underpinning the series of violent encounters that Lasota's friends and acquaintances were involved with in the years that followed their protest of the CFAR reunion.


	According to Yudkowsky, it's also a bastardization of his original theory, now known as “Logical Decision Theory” or LDT. “I don't expect the Zizian concept of ‘Timeless Decision Theory' much resembles the actuality, though I have not tried to learn about the details of what they say they believe,” Yudkowsky tells me via email. “But at any rate, LDT does not say to assault your landlord or a passing police officer, because nothing particularly good will happen on this Earth if LDT-reasoners do that, and like most decision theories, LDT advises people to do things that have good consequences rather than bad consequences.”


	The reason that LDT — the former Timeless Decision Theory — is discussed in Rationalist circles at all is, as a former colleague of Lasota's tells me, because “it is a pretty realistic situation for AIs to find themselves in.” In that world — a world where countless, nearly identical simulations are run over and over again — there is simply a source code and a series of weights that can be changed to determine an output.


	The logic doesn't work in the real world because, in the real world, people don't function like perfectly predictable machines. Or, as a different friend, puts it: “ZDT” — Zizian decision theory — “is an excellent decision theory for getting your fucking friends killed.”


	LASOTA AND HER FRIENDS WERE DRAWN to the Bay Area by the promise that they could be heroes. Instead of reorienting toward the real world after they became disillusioned with the figures who perpetuated that fantasy, they dropped deeper into a shared delusion that they alone could change the course of history. And they lashed out violently at any point that reality — the reality that rent will eventually come due, the reality that we live in a society with laws, and courts, and fines, and police officers — intruded on their fantasy.   


	“Deeply immersed in Yudkowsky's ideas, the Zizians took his framework to an extreme, embracing anarchist ideology and actions. Their radicalization process highlights a key issue: The Rationality movement offers methods for deconstructing thinking and beliefs, but offers no safeguards to prevent vulnerable individuals from spiraling into self-destruction and such harmful extremes,” Dr. Nirit Weiss-Blatt, author of the book Techlash, tells me.


	Suri Dao and Somni Leatham, charged in the 2022 murder of Emma Borhanian, and the attempted murder of the landlord Curtis Lind, are scheduled to go to trial in Solano County in March 2026. Maximillian Snyder, who is charged in Lind's January 2025 murder, pleaded not guilty in March 2025; he is scheduled to return to Solano County Superior Court in January. His onetime partner, Teresa Youngblut, faces four federal charges in Vermont related to the murder of Border Patrol agent David Maland, a case in which prosecutors intend to pursue the death penalty. She has pleaded not guilty; a trial is pending.

	











	This summer, Gwen Danielson appeared in court in Sonoma County to answer the criminal charges related to the CFAR protest, which have been reduced to misdemeanors. “Due to the case still being open, Ms. Danielson has no comment at this time. She looks forward to concluding this matter and moving forward with her life,” attorney Scott Emrick, who is representing Danielson, tells Rolling Stone.


	Lasota, Zajko, and Blank remain in custody in Maryland on weapons, drugs, and trespassing charges; their trial is set to start in February. After that case is adjudicated, Lasota faces a separate set of federal charges filed against her in June. (When she was arrested in Maryland, the federal government alleges, Lasota was in possession of several guns which, as a fugitive of justice after skipping bail in Pennsylvania, she was prohibited from having. She faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison if convicted. Lasota pleaded not guilty to those charges in November; asked to state her age for the record in court, she replied: “Timeless.”) The cases against her in Pennsylvania and Sonoma County remain open, as well.

	From jail this spring, Zajko — who, along with Blank, remains a person of interest in Zajko's parents' murders in Pennsylvania — wrote an open letter, in which they reiterated Lasota's accusations against Yudkowsky, including the claim that Yudkowsky has accelerated progress toward an artificial general intelligence, declaring “Yudkowsky may yet kill the world!”


	In the letter, Zajko writes, “I have been unable to read the news while in jail. The little news I've gotten was enough to determine that my friends and I are being described as Satan's lapdogs, the devil, and the Manson family all rolled into one … For instance, there were no truck-fulls of guns, no machine gun, and I didn't murder my parents. I assume that if the papers are lying about that, then they're lying about a lot of other things, too. You still have the option to read what Ziz actually wrote from the source, instead of relying on misrepresentative summaries. Sinceriously.fyi is on the Wayback Machine.

Priscilla Presley fended off a challenge Monday that sought to disqualify her longtime lawyer, Marty Singer, as her attorney in her financial elder abuse lawsuit against memorabilia auctioneer Brigitte Kruse.


	At a morning hearing in Santa Monica, Calif., a judge said Kruse failed to convince him that Singer gave her legal advice in 2022 and 2023 related to her business dealings with Presley, thereby creating a conflict. The judge called Kruse's evidence “very thin” when it came to her claims Singer counseled her over the phone twice. In her motion, Kruse claimed she consulted with Singer when Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE) sent her a letter in August 2022 threatening litigation over an auction of Elvis-related memorabilia that Priscilla authenticated. She claimed they spoke again in February 2023, when EPE sent a cease-and-desist letter claiming Presley's deal to market a beauty serum violated the name, image and likeness rights she previously sold to EPE.


	“I have doubts,” Judge Mark Epstein told Kruse's lawyer about the alleged phone calls. “You've given me no evidence other than a statement by Ms. Kruse. I've got no retention agreement, no email, no phone record, no notes of a conversation, no reference to a conversation in a text to Ms. Presley. I got nothing.”

	The judge noted that Singer claimed in a sworn declaration that he had “no recollection” of any calls with Kruse. And even if the conversations occurred, the judge said, they were not “substantially related” to the financial elder abuse case. In his ruling denying Kruse's effort to disqualify Singer, the judge said he takes such motions seriously, but he also respects people's right to choose their own lawyer. He said Presley had a long history with Singer that predated her dealings with Kruse, so this wasn't a case where Presley hired Singer to gain an advantage.

	











	“While Ms. Kruse and the other defendants continue to throw the kitchen sink at this case to distract from the real issues and delay facing the music, Ms. Presley is anxious to move this case forward and hold defendants accountable for their actions,” Singer said in a statement sent to Rolling Stone Monday afternoon.

	Kruse's lead lawyer, Jordan Matthews, called the decision “irrelevant” late Monday. “The court's ruling does not mean Elvis Presley's ex-wife or Mr. Singer have been absolved, and we intend to hold them accountable for their actions, as we will not tolerate any sort of misconduct in this case,” Matthews tells Rolling Stone. “Priscilla Beaulieu continues to make claims without a shred of proof, seemingly relying on her celebrity status rather than evidence, even if it means bending the rules. Today's hearing changes nothing. We are moving forward aggressively, and we are prepared to bring forward major evidence that will reveal the truth, which cannot be ignored.”


	Presley, 80, and Kruse, 42, are locked in a bitter battle over the companies Presley formed with Kruse and investor Kevin Fialko to monetize Presley's name, image, and likeness. In her July 2024 financial elder abuse complaint, Presley claimed Kruse and Fialko “manipulated” her into signing the contracts after they allegedly isolated her from her longtime business and legal advisors. She said the pair placed a “stranglehold” on her finances with contracts that gave Kruse a controlling 51 percent interest in Priscilla's intellectual property in perpetuity. She said another related venture gave her only a 20 percent share and that altogether, she was duped out of more than $1 million. She and her lawyers called the contracts so “egregious” and “unconscionable,” they're unenforceable.


	For their part, Kruse and Fialko claim they were always truthful and invested heavily in the joint ventures to pull Presley back from the brink of insolvency. (Video obtained by Rolling Stone shows Presley appearing fully cognizant and signing many of the documents at issue at Kruse's Florida home in January 2023.) According to Kruse and Fialko, Presley allegedly made an about-face and shunned them, in violation of their contracts, once her fortunes changed after the 2023 death of Lisa Marie Presley, her only child with Elvis.

	As Rolling Stone previously reported, a few weeks after Lisa Marie's death, Priscilla challenged a 2016 amendment to her daughter's Promenade Trust that removed Priscilla as a trustee and replaced her with Lisa Marie's eldest daughter, Riley Keough. The disputed change meant Priscilla would have lost influence over her daughter's assets, including Graceland mansion, its archives, and Lisa Marie's 15 percent interest in EPE, which owns and manages Elvis' name, image, and likeness. Priscilla wanted the court to declare the amendment “invalid.”

	











	With a potential legal war looming, Keough reached a generous settlement with her grandmother in a matter of months. Under the deal, Priscilla received a $1 million lump-sum payment off the top of Lisa Marie's $25 million life insurance policy. Keough also agreed to pay Priscilla $50,000 to resign as co-trustee of the irrevocable trust whose sole asset was the life insurance policy. Priscilla was also awarded an annual salary of $100,000 for 10 years for her new role as a “special adviser” to the Promenade Trust.

	After she settled with Keough, Presley sent a cease-and-desist to Kruse and Fialko in August 2023. Two months later, she was hit with the first breach-of-contract lawsuit over the partnership. Nine months after that, she filed her bombshell claims of financial elder abuse.


	Last summer, a judge put Kruse's Florida-based lawsuit on hold, saying Presley's elder abuse lawsuit should proceed first. The Orlando-based judge said it didn't make sense to “enforce rights under agreements” when the “validity” of the agreements remained “squarely in dispute in the California case.” That ruling set the stage for Kruse and Fialko to file their breach-of-contract claims as a standalone, $50 million lawsuit filed in Beverly Hills in August, then as a cross-complaint in the Santa Monica elder abuse case in October.

If it's the first Monday in December (and the first day back after the Thanksgiving holiday, ouch), most of the NYC film world can be found at the Gotham Film Awards, back in its traditional venue at Cipriani Wall Street. The ceremony is typically viewed as the first big live awards show of the season, and offers a glitzy entry into the weeks (and months!) to come. As ever, IndieWire was in the room for this year's event, and watched a pretty thrilling evening unfold.

This year's nominees were led by Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another,” which picked up six nominations, but only walked away with one: the night's crown jewel, Best Feature.

Despite an influx of tributes for other films from the studio and streaming world, including “After the Hunt,” “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,” “Song Sung Blue,” “Frankenstein,” “Sinners,” “Hedda,” and “Jay Kelly,” it was comparatively smaller films that made off with some of the night's biggest wins. That included three wins for Jafar Panahi and his “It Was Just an Accident,” plus trophies for “My Father's Shadow,” “Pillion,” and more.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






For the first time in its history, this year's batch of Gotham nominees included 10 Best Feature picks. In previous years, the category only included five nominees, but the category was expanded for the 2025 season to include up to 10 nominees. While Anderson's film was nominated in that category (and much was made of its studio bonafides), the other nine picks represented a strong array of indie offerings, including titles like “East of Wall,” “Lurker,” and “Familiar Touch,” alongside heavy-hitters like “Hamnet” and “Train Dreams.”

Nominees are chosen by committees of film critics, journalists, festival programmers, and film curators. Separate juries of writers, directors, actors, producers, editors, and other film industry professionals will determine the final Gothams recipients. (This year's nominating committees included myself and Chief Film Critic David Ehrlich.)

Jada Pinkett Smith is being accused of threatening harm to her husband Will Smith's former close friend for revealing details about her personal life in a bombshell new lawsuit.

In the lawsuit filed on Nov. 7, Bilaal Salaam — who refers to himself as Will's “best friend for nearly 40 years” — claims Jada confronted him at Will's birthday party on Sept. 25, 2021, held at the Regency Calabasas Common.

“While in the lobby, Jada Pinkett Smith approached Plaintiff with approximately seven members of her entourage, became verbally aggressive, and threatened Plaintiff by stating that if he continued ‘telling her personal business,' he would ‘end up missing or catch a bullet,' and demanded he sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) ‘or else,'” the lawsuit obtained by Page Six claims

Salaam alleges that an associate of Jada's then followed him to his car and continued making verbal threats against him.

In the lawsuit, he claims “a retaliatory campaign” was later launched against him after he refused to help with crisis management following Will slapping Chris Rock at the 2022 Oscars. 

Salaam claims he refused to perform tasks he “believed were illegal, unethical, or morally compromising,” per the docs.

Salaam is also suing Jada for “intentional infliction of emotional distress” because she denied to TMZ that she had ever seen Will engage in any sexual or intimate behavior with men.

“This was a false denial, as Plaintiff had already released a viral video showing Will Smith groping Alfonso Ribeiro (including his penis, nipple, and buttocks) in front of Defendant and her children, who were visibly present,” according to the lawsuit. (Ribeiro has never commented on the claims). 

Salaam claims in the lawsuit that Jada's “false denial” was a deliberate effort to discredit him and imply that his prior statements about Will were “inaccurate, delusional, or fabricated, causing severe public ridicule and loss of credibility.”

More allegations include that he was threatened by a manager on behalf of Jada to “work something out” and to “end this feud before you get physically hurt” in regards to a memoir he was planning to release.

Salaam claims his reputation was destroyed, his health deteriorated, and that he suffered financial loss and emotional trauma as a result of Jada's alleged “malicious, intentional, and reckless conduct,” per the lawsuit.

He's seeking $3 million in damages.

Reps for Jada and Will didn't immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment.

This isn't the first time Salaam has made accusations against Will. In November 2023, Will's rep denied Salaam's claims that he caught Will having sex with actor Duane Martin.

“This story is completely fabricated and the claim is unequivocally false,” his rep told TMZ at the time.

With family dinners now firmly out of fashion thanks to TikTok, there's only one thing left that can bring families together: Sequels to box office smash hits about misunderstood villains. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, Zootopia 2 had a massive Thanksgiving weekend for Disney, which has been clinging to its emotional support Lilo & Stitch remake all year as Snow White, Elio, and Tron: Ares crashed out over a cruel 2025. But now that Disney has released its final Jared Leto-led film of the year, it can relish Zooptopia 2‘s $98 million opening weekend and its collective domestic five-day take of $158 million, per The Numbers. Worldwide, the movie has grossed $559 million, making Zooptopia 2 the largest global opening for an animated film ever and the second-largest global opening behind Avengers: Endgame.

Movie theaters cleaned up this weekend, and it's essentially thanks to having two movies in wide release that appeal to families. Despite a noticeable drop-off in enthusiasm from the first movie, Wicked: For Good continued to do good. In its second weekend, the film earned $61 million, sending Jon M. Chu's sequel over the $200 million mark. In total, Wicked: For Good has grossed $390 million worldwide, an incredible figure made modest by Zootopia 2. No wonder studios put all their money in tentpoles. If one hits, you make a lot of money very, very quickly.

Sequels ruled the rest of the top five. Now You Three Me and Predator: Badlands took in $6.9 million and $4.8 million, respectively. Neither has made $100 million domestic, but overseas, both are doing quite well—unless, of course, the studios expected Zootopia money, in which case they're bombs. Speaking of which, Edgar Wright's Running Man is limping at this point, adding another $3.7 million to a $60 million global take. We imagine the movie will find its audience on planes and Paramount+.

While much of the top 10 remains stagnant, there were some interesting additions. Netflix rarely reports its box office grosses, but it claims the latest Knives Out mystery, Wake Up Dead Man, took in $1.5 million in 600 theaters. That's a considerable drop-off from the $9.2 million that Glass Onion made in its opening weekend in November 2022 during the film's brief theatrical release. While it might be easy to say people are waiting to watch this one on Netflix, there was stiffer competition in 2025 than three years ago. Glass Onion opened in 696 theaters against the third weekend of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and the Disney misfire Strange World.

A24's afterlife rom-com, Eternity, and Chloé Zhao's “emotional wrecking ball,” Hamnet, served as counterprogramming for the childless. Without the additional child-priced ticket sales, Eternity returned $3.1 million in its opening weekend. Meanwhile, Hamnet, still in limited release, made just shy of $1 million. People need to find out how Shakespeare came up with the idea for Hamlet, and the answer is a one-way ticket to a depressing holiday classic.

Here's the full top 10:

The Bennu Sample!

Planetary scientists have found a wide range of molecules that are crucial for life among a lot of other organic substances present in asteroids, meteors, and even interstellar space. Now, scientists report new insights into asteroid Bennu, which was sampled by the NASA mission OSIRIS-REx. The latest research suggests tentative evidence for a substance we have not encountered before in extraterrestrial material.

When it comes to molecules fundamental to life, we usually focus on the nucleotide bases: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil, which are the fundamental units of DNA and RNA. There are also amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. Although over 500 are known, only 22 are used by known life. Of those 22, only 14 have been found in stuff from outer space – until now, possibly.

The new work confirms the presence in the sample of all five nucleobases and of the 14 amino acids that were already found by others. They also report tentative detections of tryptophan, a pretty important amino acid. This molecule is the precursor of the neurotransmitter and “happiness molecule” serotonin, of the hormone melatonin, which regulates the sleep cycle, and the vitamin B3. A form of vitamin B3 has previously been detected in the Bennu sample, which gives credence to this new detection.

Still, the team is looking into other ways to check the Bennu material to confirm the presence of tryptophan without doubt. Tryptophan is pretty fragile, so it is not a big surprise that it has not been found before in meteorites. The delicate collection of 121.6 grams (4.3 ounces) of material by OSIRIS-REx might have kept this and other dainty molecules safe.

“Our findings expand the evidence that prebiotic organic molecules can form within primitive accreting planetary bodies and could have been delivered via impacts to the early Earth and other Solar System bodies, potentially contributing to the origins of life,” the authors wrote in the paper.

OSIRIS-REx dropped a capsule with the sample in the Utah desert after over two years orbiting the 500-meter (1,630-foot) wide Bennu, which is currently the number one most dangerous asteroid, as it has a 1-in-1,750 chance of hitting our planet between 2178 and 2290. The date of greater risk is September 24, 2182. Coincidentally, the sample came back to Earth on September 24, 2023.

The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

An effort aimed at conspiracy theorists follows the marketer enacting its first brand platform relaunch in a decade with Adam&eveDDB.

Columbia is taking a shot across the bow at conspiracy theorists with “Expedition Impossible,” a tongue-in-cheek take on social media challenges that asks flat-earthers to find the world's edge and snap a picture as proof. Press details emphasize that the “Edge of the Earth” within the contest parameters needs to be a literal drop off point into the infinite void, not just an impressive cliff face on a local hike.  

The company is putting assets valued at $100,000 on the line, inclusive of outdoor gear, office plants, mannequins and more. Boyle explains the stakes in humorous social videos where a lawyer intervenes to correct him about what the process for handing off the winnings would entail and employees act befuddled as he tries to showcase all that's at stake. 

“This is a message to Flat Earthers. I've seen your manifestos, admired your diagrams, watched you stand proudly on your, well, flat ground. So here's the deal: it's time to put your map where your mouth is,” writes Boyle in an open letter running in the Times. “Our gear is built to handle anything. So I'm inviting you to do what no one in history has ever done: find the edge of the Earth.”  

Boyle's message joins a tradition of outdoors brand executives making public statements on topical issues, albeit with a humorous twist. Taking flat-earthers to task could inspire online chatter about Columbia around the key holiday shopping period, and the brand will directly inject itself into online communities where farfetched ideas are heatedly discussed. That said, poking the conspiracy theorist bear also risks the potential for backlash from outspoken fringe types.

Conspiracy theories have increasingly bled into the cultural mainstream in an era of social media misinformation and distrust in legacy media. Flat Eartherism, in turn, has seen a 21st century resurgence, including among some celebrities, despite a surfeit of longstanding scientific and photographic evidence that the Earth is, in fact, spherical in shape. 

“Expedition Impossible” is part of Columbia's efforts to put forward bolder, conversation-starting marketing following its first brand platform relaunch in a decade. The marketer in August debuted “Engineered for Whatever,” a multiseason ad campaign that uses edgy, over-the-top humor to illustrate the toughness of its products under extreme conditions.

“Engineered for Whatever” is meant to serve as a counter to what Columbia views as overly pristine, idyllic outdoors marketing from rivals. Adam&eveDDB is the Portland, Oregon-based brand's global agency of record and helped develop “Expedition Impossible.”

Physicists at the University of Albany, New York, have announced a new research initiative—dubbed UAlbany Project X—that marks the beginning of a long-term scientific study of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP).

The new project, officially launched last month, was made possible by an endowment gift that will provide ongoing funding for the team's scientific investigation of aerial mysteries, which are currently also being investigated in a separate effort by the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).

Kevin Knuth, Ph.D., a professor of physics at the University of Albany and one of the new project's lead scientists, told The Debrief that UAlbany Project X (UAPx) is an outgrowth of many years of ongoing research that he and his colleagues behind the new effort have already undertaken.

“We've been working on studying UAP scientifically for about seven years now,” Knuth explained, adding that his entry into the study of aerial mysteries began with an examination of the many decades of information that have been collected on the topic.

“I started by just doing what a physicist ought to do, which is getting your head around the problem,” Knuth told The Debrief. This ultimately led to his collaboration with scientists from the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies to author a 2019 paper that estimated the minimum speeds and accelerations of UAP observed in several notable cases. Among these was a 2004 incident involving an object observed by U.S. Navy personnel aboard the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) during training exercises off the southern California coast.

Footage of the object, popularly known today as the “Tic Tac,” was obtained by an FA/18 Super Hornet pilot named Chad Underwood and subsequently leaked online. In 2020, the Pentagon confirmed the footage was authentic in an official release accompanied by two other historic videos purportedly depicting UAP, while noting that the object in the 2004 video remained “unidentified.”

That incident, Knuth says, had been part of what led him and fellow University of Albany physicist and associate professor Matthew Szydagis, along with several colleagues, to conduct a field expedition in 2021 off the coast of Santa Catalina Island with a non-profit scientific research organization called UAPx.

“We worked to have an updated collection mission over the Catalina Channel where the Nimitz Encounter occurred,” Knuth told The Debrief, during which the University of Albany researchers collected observable-light and infrared imagery, and other data that helped them develop a framework for the scientific documentation of UAP.

That work culminated in a paper by Szydagis and co-authored by Knuth and their colleague, University of Albany associate professor Cecilia Levy—the core of the new UAlbany Project X initiative—published in Progress in Aerospace Sciences earlier this year.

“This was a really seminal paper,” Szydagis told The Debrief, describing it as “a summary of UAPx's first results from the Catalina-Laguna mission.”

“I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of scientists who have gotten their work on the UAP topic published in such a high-caliber journal,” Szydagis said. A second co-authored paper on the history of the UAP subject, with Knuth as the lead author, had appeared in the same edition of the journal, along with a separate study by Luc Dini, Geoffrey Mestchersky, and Jacques Vallée that provided estimates of energy values associated with a historic UAP incident.

“It's a highly reputable journal that is cited by a lot of other scientists,” Szydagis said. “And yet, nobody talked about either that paper or Kevin's history paper.”

“In the UAPx paper, we did something that we thought would be considered very important,” Szydagis said. “We concluded the paper with suggestions on how to quantify the meaning of extraordinary evidence, and very few people seem to be paying attention to that.”

Today, while UAP—or UFOs, as they are traditionally known—often succeed in dominating prime time television news segments, podcasts, and occasionally even mainstream publications like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and other peer-reviewed journals like Nature: Scientific Reports, the majority of the attention the subject receives goes toward the question of government secrecy, and how much more the U.S. intelligence community may know about UAP than it has disclosed to the public.

Such questions had been the focus of a recent documentary, The Age of Disclosure, by filmmaker Dan Farah, in which a trove of current and past U.S. government officials that included Marco Rubio, currently serving as U.S. Secretary of State, and James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence, spoke on the record about the issue of transparency regarding information collected about UAP.

Yet, while the question over government secrecy involving UAP commands much of the attention in the media cycle, that isn't to say that the work of scientists—particularly those with the University of Albany team—had been overlooked by everyone.

Enter Tony Gorman, a well-known Albany-area businessman with many years of experience who was previously a co-owner of The Gorman Group, a family-owned highway construction company that has operated in the area for many decades.

Gorman had seen a short local news story about the UAP research Knuth, Szydagis, and Levy were conducting at the University of Albany, which prompted him to reach out to the team to help ensure an ongoing source of funding for their work.

“I have always been curious about UAPs and what could possibly be out there,” Gorman said in a statement. “When I saw the UAP research the UAlbany team is doing, I wanted to learn more.”

Gorman reached out and, after a series of discussions with the UAlbany researchers, decided to put his money behind their scientific efforts.

“I gained so much respect for their work,” Gorman said. “Right there, I knew I wanted to get involved.”

“We received this donation from Tony Gorman,” Knuth told The Debrief. “A generous donation, which basically funds us for five years, and in addition to that, sets up an endowment that funds us in perpetuity.”

“So we're here to stay.”

“We have money to help sustain us for the long term,” Szydagis told The Debrief. “With Tony's very generous gift, we have the potential ability to be working on UAP for the rest of our lives.”

As for what the team specifically plans to work on, Szydagis explained that part of its plan is to leverage knowledge from past research while carefully plotting a course forward through strategic investigations that will help the physicists expand the data they are collecting on UAP.

“We're planning a long-term, cautious, sustainable plan to keep working on UAPs for decades to come,” Szydagis said, though noting that the team is also working to ensure that it does not add to “the clutter of more projects and more silos.”

“So the old UAPx is closing down, and it's being reborn,” Szydagis told The Debrief. “We are preserving UAPx's original mission.”

“Through an incredibly generous gift from Tony Gorman, Professors Knuth, Matthey Szydagis, and Cecilia Levy have secured a major endowment to launch UAlbany Project X (UAPx)—the direct academic continuation of everything we've built from scratch,” wrote Gary Voorhis, a U.S. Navy veteran and former CEO and co-founder of the original nonprofit UAPx.

“They did it. They took our little rag-tag expedition team and turned it into a funded, university-backed research program with the potential to run for decades,” Voorhis wrote.

Knuth says the new UAlbany Project X will seek not only to collect more data on UAP but also to clarify the subject, how science can be applied to it, and to help dispel misconceptions about UAP.

In addition to the core University of Albany team, the researchers have announced they will receive input from experts, including physicist Eric W. Davis, who Szydagis said will work with the team on a volunteer basis as an adjunct researcher in an advisory position for the project.

“We are deeply honored to have him,” Dr. Szydagis told The Debrief.

“There has been a lot of excellent work done,” Knuth added, although noting that he hopes UAlbany Project X will be able to take scientific approaches to UAP research into new and exciting areas.

“I think the best thing to do is to learn from the mistakes of others, and to build on their successes,” Knuth said. “We've gotten diffraction gratings for high-quality cameras, and we plan to collect spectra. And magnetic and electric fields are often omitted from study, and so we plan to accommodate that as well, along with an excellent network of multiple cameras.”

“We have plans to build arrays of cameras to watch the sky and have this portable,” Knuth told The Debrief. “Basically, take your equipment and plant it somewhere for a couple of weeks, and collect data. That's the way to do it.”

Thanks to Gorman's endowment, the team also plans to ramp up publication of scientific papers on UAP.

“You should expect more papers from us, not just field expeditions,” Szydagis told The Debrief. “We've got all kinds of ideas on papers we want to publish on this topic broadly. And now we can start working on more of these things.”

“We no longer have to just work on this for free in our volunteer time,” Szydagis added, “which is not sustainable long-term.”

Fundamentally, Szydagis says that he, Levy, and Knuth will continue the mission that began during the original UAPx field expedition in 2021 and advance those efforts by collecting new data in the years ahead.

“UAPx is a phoenix being reborn,” Szydagis said. “It's not dying, it's not disappearing.”

“The mission will continue as a university effort.”

A Downton Abbey star looks totally unrecognisable sporting a very different look in the 'absorbing' supernatural Netflix thriller Talamasca: The Secret Order. 

The supernatural horror spy thriller, which is based on Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles and Lives of the Mayfair Witches, premiered on AMC in October this year.

On December 1, the show landed on Netflix in the UK and many have already binged the full six-part series. 

'A young lawyer with an unusual gift joins an ancient, secretive agency to unravel a supernatural mystery - and confront his family's dark past,' the streaming service's synopsis reads.  

The show stars Nicholas Denton as Guy Anatole, Celine Buckens as Doris, Maisie Richardson-Sellers as Olive and William Fichtner as Jasper.

Another actress in the programme is Elizabeth McGovern - who has taken on the role of Helen.

Many will know Elizabeth for a number of other roles including Ordinary People, The Handmaid's Tale and The Wife. 

She also played Cora, Countess of Grantham, in Downton Abbey between 2010 and 2015. 

Helen new character looks totally different to her alter-ego on the ITV drama. 

In Downton Abbey, the star rocked brunette hair, while in the new series, she's got a much lighter platinum bob and vampy makeup. 

And many fans have raved over the 'superb' acting in the show on IMDB.

'The series itself is a great concept. Well acted. Well done.' 

'Absolutely love it.' 

'Looking forward to seeing where this goes and if it keeps going after recently revealing their main plot. 

'Its a breath of fresh air compared to other fantasy adventure shows out there. My only common is it needs to showcase mo powers, less talk.'

'Loving it so far.' 

'Excellent so far, brilliant casting, so happy - finally someone's building a good story, creating a mood, clever writing and good performances.

'I'm excited to see if they'll maintain the quality, but based on what I've seen so far, it's very well done. And - what's with the negative reviews? Looks like very high quality to me, and is elevated above the usual pedestrian tedium and predictable scripts.' 

'Damn it, it's good.'

'The cliffhangers on the final episode make me excited and hopeful for a second season.' 

'Talamasca is one of those rare supernatural shows that feels fresh, intelligent, and genuinely atmospheric. 

'Instead of relying on cheap scares or flashy effects, it leans into world-building, character depth, and a slow-burning sense of mystery - and it absolutely works.'

'Very impressive!'

'I really enjoyed the show. Not what I thought it was going to be when I started watching it, but it is very well done in my opinion. 

'I have to have so many characters in this review so I keep talking and talking and talking and talking. Damn I still don't have enough. I'm almost there. Finally, I finished.' 

'There's a great plot and interesting characters. It keeps me guessing and I'm always on the edge of my seat watching. I'm praying for a 2nd season!'

Many are desperate to know if there will be a second series.

And although nothing has been confirmed, protagonist Nicholas Denton has hinted that he wants the programme to make a return. 

He told TV Insider: 'The first season's really interesting because you've got to start.

'You're setting up a new world, new lore, new characters, you're building them up, and you want to set them free, let 'em go nuts on the world. 

'And that's what I'm hoping for.'

He added that 'there's the rest of the world to cover' and 'there's a lot to unpack' with Guy and Doris (Celine Buckens).  

Talamasca: The Secret Order was created by John Lee Hancock and the showrunners include John and Mark Lafferty. 

The likes of Tomi May, Will Brown, Bryony Hannah, Eric Bogosian and Jason Schwartzman also appear on the programme.

Aston Martin F1 star Fernando Alonso has described his car as having 'disconnections' that are a 'bit paranormal' following a good result at the Qatar Grand Prix.


44-year-old Alonso finished up in seventh in the main race at the Lusail International Circuit, and claimed a valuable six points for his team in their fight for sixth in the constructors' championship. 


However, he was lucky to get away with a spin on lap 42, which spun him around 360 degrees, and he carried on in the race without too much bother. The incident did cost him two places, however, with the Spaniard running up in fifth until that spin.


After the race, Alonso tried to explain what happened to cause him to spin around despite not having contact with any other car, and suggested that there could be paranormal forces at play.


"No, I was taking it easy," Alonso told media after the race. 


"The truth is that I wasn't pushing 100%, but this car has disconnections, I don't know what to call them, a bit paranormal, there's a spirit inside the car."


"Then yesterday, I suddenly lost the front end for three or four corners. In one of them, I suddenly went off onto the gravel, turning the steering wheel all the way. It was as if I had no front wheels. 


"And today it was the rear wheels, suddenly a lash, so we're hypersensitive to the wind, hypersensitive to one or two degrees of temperature, we're always on a knife edge and today I made that mistake, but fortunately I was very lucky that there was no gravel, that there was nothing and that I didn't have a train of cars behind me."


Nevertheless, seventh in the main race was a handy result for Alonso, and he remains in with a chance of claiming a top-10 spot in the drivers' championship with one event remaining in the season.


His recent flurry of points since the Spanish GP in June has come despite him having to drive such an inconsistent Aston Martin car, and he is sincerely hoping that the team can improve for the final year of his current contract.


Alonso has admitted that he may retire at the end of 2026, but only if he gets a season where he can challenge nearer to the front again next year.


Aston Martin are a very ambitious team, and are hoping to be challenging for race wins in the near future, taking on the likes of design legend Adrian Newey and Ferrari stalwart Enrico Cardile in their attempts to do so.


Having not won a race since the 2013 Spanish GP, Alonso is very much hoping to benefit from the predicted upward trend of the Silverstone-based outfit.

A former soldier who participated in leaflet-dropping operations against North Korea has testified that the Defense Psychological Operation Group, a unit directly under the Ministry of National Defense, secretly sent leaflets to North Korea from October 2023 until just before the emergency martial law declaration on Dec. 3, 2024. 

While some media reports previously indicated that propaganda leaflets were sent by military authorities as well as civilian groups during the Yoon Suk-yeol administration, this is the first time a soldier involved in the operation has provided testimony. 

The Defense Psychological Operation Group, or DPOG, is a unit tasked with conducting psychological warfare operations, such as distributing leaflets and broadcasting via loudspeakers, in times of emergency.

“In mid-October 2023, I sent about 10 large balloons carrying leaflets toward the North for the first time with fellow unit members at the front line,” the former soldier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the Hankyoreh on Sunday. The young man served in the psyops unit from 2023 to 2024. 

The whistleblower's unit reportedly conducted operations about once or twice every two months from then until November 2024. From then on, according to the former soldier, the unit released about 100 balloons per operation, each carrying approximately 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of leaflets.

The DPOG's leaflet dispersal operations intensified after the Constitutional Court struck down a legal provision banning the sending of leaflets to North Korea on Sept. 26, 2023, finding it unconstitutional. 

“Before the Constitutional Court's decision, we conducted leaflet distribution training in rear bases. Starting that September, we began training at the bases near the Military Demarcation Line, and more frequently as well,” the former soldier said. He added that he and others conducted realistic training for about a month and then, the following month in October, actually sent balloons carrying leaflets to North Korea.

According to the whistleblower, the psyops unit at the time marked North Korean military bases, airports and cities with a certain population size on military maps. They then calculated wind direction and speed in real-time to determine the most suitable targets for leaflet balloons. The former soldier said troops sent leaflets “as far as Wonsan” on the eastern coast. 

The psychological warfare unit conducted operations on days when civilian groups were known to send leaflets to North Korea, to avoid exposure of their activities. “Around 9 to 11 pm, unit members would change out of their military uniforms, which had their names and unit affiliations, into black clothing worn by special operations personnel before being deployed for the operation,” the former soldier said. The leaflet balloons were not only launched by the whistleblower's unit but also from multiple locations along the central and western fronts.

Rep. Boo Seung-chan of the Democratic Party, who has been tracking the DPOG's leaflet activities, said that the operations were part of Yoon's plan to concoct an excuse for invoking martial law.

“The Yoon administration sought to provoke North Korea not only with drones infiltrating Pyongyang but also with propaganda leaflets in order to create justification for declaring martial law,” Boo said.
