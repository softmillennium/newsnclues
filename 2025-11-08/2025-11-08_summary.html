The administration has gutted enforcement of a corporate tax enacted as part of the  Biden-era Inflation Reducation Act.

The Trump administration is quietly waging an all-out regulatory war on a Biden-era corporate tax that aimed to prevent large companies from dodging their tax liabilities while reporting huge profits.

The corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) was enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, Democratic legislation that former President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022. The CAMT requires highly profitable US corporations to pay a tax of at least 15% on their so-called book profits, the figures reported to shareholders.

As the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy has explained: “Many of the special breaks that corporations use to avoid taxes work by allowing companies to report profits to the IRS that are much smaller than their book profits. Corporate leaders prefer to report low profits to the IRS (to reduce taxes) and high profits to the public (to attract investors).”

But since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has issued guidance and regulatory proposals designed to gut the CAMT. The effort is a boon to corporate giants and rich private equity investors at a time when the Trump administration is relentlessly attacking programs for low-income Americans, including Medicaid and nutrition assistance.

The New York Times reported Saturday that “with its various tax relief provisions, the administration is now effectively adding hundreds of billions of dollars in new breaks for big businesses and investors” on top of the trillions of dollars in tax cuts included in the Trump-GOP budget law enacted over the summer.

“The Treasury is empowered to write rules to help the IRS carry out tax laws passed by Congress,” the newspaper added. “But the aggressive actions of the Trump administration raise questions about whether it is exceeding its legal authority.”

Why would corporations spend millions on Trump's ballroom or bitcoin?Because they're getting billions in unlegislated tax breaks.We've gone from a system where the rich must pay taxes for public services, to one where they must pay the president for private favors.

The administration's assault on the CAMT has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress.

In a September 8 letter to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a group of Democratic lawmakers and Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) warned that the administration's guidance notices “create new loopholes in the corporate alternative minimum tax for the largest and wealthiest corporations.”

“Most troubling, Notice 2025-27, issued this June, allows companies to avoid CAMT if their income — under a simplified accounting method — is below $800 million,” the lawmakers wrote. “The Biden administration previously set the safe harbor threshold precisely at $500 million in its proposed CAMT rule after calculating that a higher safe harbor threshold would risk exempting corporations that should be subject to CAMT under statute.”

“Now, less than nine months later and with zero justification, this new guidance summarily asserts that an $800 million safe harbor will not run that risk,” they continued. “We are seriously concerned that this cursory loosening of CAMT enforcement will simply allow more wealthy corporations to avoid paying their legally owed share.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

The suit seeks details on the extent of ICE's use of invasive surveillance tech to track immigrants and activists.

Civil rights attorneys are suing the Trump administration to force the release of records detailing whether federal immigration agencies are using sophisticated Israeli spyware to track, monitor, and target immigrants and activists across the country.

The lawsuit, filed on Oct. 30 in federal court by Just Futures Law and the Center for Constitutional Rights, demands that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) comply with Freedom of Information Act requests related to their contracts with tech companies Cellebrite and Paragon Solutions. Both companies have been linked to government surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders, and protesters around the world. 

Attorneys say immigrant rights are at urgent risk as the administration escalates arrests, detentions, and protest-related charges under President Donald Trump's second term.

“The public has the right to know whether and to what extent the U.S. government deploys powerful spyware to infect people's phones, extract data, and surveil people's daily communications,” Julie Mao, an attorney at Just Futures Law, said in a press release. 

“Like other law enforcement agencies, ICE employs various forms of technology to investigate violations of the law, while appropriately respecting civil liberties and privacy interests,” an ICE spokesperson said in response to a request for comment.

CBP did not respond to Prism's request for comment.

ICE has worked with Israeli spyware company Cellebrite for more than a decade. The agency currently holds two active contracts totaling $11 million with the company, which markets phone-cracking tools that allow law enforcement to extract data from locked devices, according to the attorneys' press release. CBP, which also holds at least 20 Cellebrite software licenses, has partnered with the firm since 2008, the press release states.

Spyware from the Israel-based Paragon Solutions, known as Graphite, is considered even more invasive. According to technical researchers, the tool can hack into smartphones, including encrypted messaging apps, without the user's knowledge. ICE entered into a contract with Paragon in September 2024, but the Biden administration paused the agreement due to national security concerns after issuing an executive order limiting the use of spyware by federal agencies. Trump reversed that decision in August, clearing ICE to resume the contract.

Members of Congress sent a letter last month demanding answers from ICE about its use of Graphite, calling the secrecy surrounding the program “deeply alarming.”

Immigrant communities fear these tools could supercharge longstanding surveillance and criminalization. Advocates say the technologies fit into a broader landscape in which immigrants and their supporters have been increasingly treated as threats to public order. Organizers from Dallas to Los Angeles report that social media posts about protests have drawn ICE attention. Family members have had their devices searched during home raids. Community defense networks believe the government is monitoring WhatsApp chats used to coordinate court support and legal aid.

The level of intrusion remains unclear, which is precisely what the lawsuit seeks to change.

“We should not have to go to federal court to force the government to hand over these records,” Ian Head, manager of the Open Records Project at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in the press release. “This administration wants to hide its abusive, Orwellian behavior, but we are fighting back.” 

Earlier this year, the Canadian digital watchdog group Citizen Lab published a report tracing Paragon spyware deployments targeting political activists and journalists in Italy, Australia, Canada, and Denmark. Rights advocates fear the same tactics are now being adopted within U.S. borders and directed at already-vulnerable groups.

Surveillance researchers say the expansion reflects a deepening trend: Domestic policing agencies are increasingly using military-grade technology developed for foreign intelligence operations.

“In the wake of 9/11, federal agencies provided considerable funding to state and local law enforcement agencies to collect, analyze, share, and deploy a wide range of new data,” researcher Sarah Brayne told the research organization Data & Society. “Increasingly, local law enforcement agencies recognized these data could be useful for their own quotidian surveillance.”

Food banks are in “disaster response mode” after SCOTUS blocked a lower court order that the funds be distributed.

The U.S. Supreme Court late Friday temporarily blocked a lower court order that required the Trump administration to fully fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits as the government shutdown drags on with no end in sight.

One wrinkle in the case is that the Supreme Court order, which came after the Trump administration appealed the lower court directive, was handed down by liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Her brief order came after the Massachusetts-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit opted not to swiftly intervene in the case.

Jackson, who is tasked with handling emergency issues from the 1st Circuit, wrote that her administrative stay in the case will end 48 hours after the appeals court issues a ruling in the case.

The justice's order came after states across the U.S. had already begun distributing SNAP benefits after a district court judge directed the Trump administration to release billions of dollars in funds by Friday.

“Some people woke up Friday with the money already on the debit-like EBT cards they use to buy groceries,” NPR reported.

Steve Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University, wrote Friday that “it may surprise folks that Justice Jackson, who has been one of the most vocal critics of the court's behavior on emergency applications from the Trump administration, acquiesced in even a temporary pause of the district court's ruling in this case.”

He continued:

But as I read the order, which says a lot more than a typical “administrative stay” from the Court, Jackson was stuck between a rock and a hard place—given the incredibly compressed timing that was created by the circumstances of the case.

In a world in which Justice Jackson either knew or suspected that at least five of the justices would grant temporary relief to the Trump administration if she didn't, the way she structured the stay means that she was able to try to control the timing of the Supreme Court's (forthcoming) review—and to create pressure for it to happen faster than it otherwise might have. In other words, it's a compromise—one with which not everyone will agree, but which strikes me as eminently defensible under these unique (and, let's be clear, maddening and entirely f-ing avoidable) circumstances.

The Trump administration has fought tooth and nail to flout its legal obligation to distribute SNAP funds during the shutdown as low-income Americans grow increasingly desperate and food bank demand skyrockets.

“This is insane,” U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) wrote after the administration appealed to the Supreme Court. “Trump is jumping through hoops to block SNAP. Follow the law, fund SNAP, and feed American families.”

Maura Healey, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts — one of the states that quickly moved to process SNAP benefits following the district court order — said in a statement that “Trump should never have put the American people in this position.”

“Families shouldn't have had to go hungry because their president chose to put politics over their lives,” said Healey.

Feeding America, a nonprofit network of hundreds of food banks across the US, said Friday that food banks bought nearly 325% more food through the organization's grocery purchase program during the week of October 27 than they did at the same time last year.

Donations to food banks, which were underresourced even prior to the shutdown, have also skyrocketed. The head of a Houston food bank said the organization is in “disaster response mode.”

“Across the country, communities are feeling the real, human impact the shutdown is having on their neighbors and communities,” said Linda Nageotte, president and chief operating officer at Feeding America. “Families, seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities are showing strength through the hardship, and their communities are standing beside them—giving their time and money, and advocating so no one faces hunger alone.”

Women from 17 different countries are working together to coordinate the global struggle against mass incarceration.

Susan Kigula spent 10 years on death row in Uganda, where a murder conviction carried a mandatory death penalty. Undeterred by the threat of execution, Kigula buried her misery in legal books and mobilized a team of lawyers that eventually included current British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Kigula went on to file an appeal on behalf of 417 people incarcerated on death row in Uganda, and her effort saved her own life and the lives of 416 others. 

Today Kigula is free and a member of the leadership of the International Network of Formerly Incarcerated Women (INFIW). The network is the product of years of grassroots organizing across the globe — efforts that culminated in a 2023 convening in Bogota, Colombia, where 60 women from 17 countries met to share strategies on halting the massive population increase in women's prisons and jails around the world.

The 2023 convening sought to implement an international declaration created in 2021, which proclaimed that “now is the time to invest in initiatives led by incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women and girls and their families, addressing stigma and discrimination, and reducing the damage of centuries of purely punitive penal policies that have negatively impacted millions of people, including those deprived of liberty, their families and communities.” In the years after the declaration was issued, members of the INFIW had built local, national and regional organizations to magnify their political power and consolidate under the banner of abolition.

The renowned activist and former political prisoner Angela Davis addressed the Bogotá gathering via video, reminding those in attendance they were “the vanguard of social justice movement precisely because … [they recognized] that given the interconnected economic, political, and social structures that characterize our times, it is incumbent on us to develop strategies of social justice that are also global in scope.”

The advent of the INFIW emerged from a simple realization: The voices and presence of formerly incarcerated women were missing from major international policy spaces like the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS). In 2015, Andrea James of the U.S.-based National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women and Girls (The National Council) stepped into that void, taking part in forums at the OAS and the UN and successfully putting women's incarceration on regional and international agendas.

From there, momentum grew. Working with the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), The National Council began building cross-border connections, traveling first to México in 2017 to join a workshop with an emerging network of formerly incarcerated women. They followed with visits to Brazil, Argentina, and a return to México to lay the groundwork for the first regional workshop in Bogotá, Colombia, in 2019, titled “Women Resisting: Bringing Down the Bars.” 

That historic gathering, organized by Corporación Humanas, Mujeres Libres, the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), and The National Council brought together directly impacted women from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, México, and the United States. The attendees, speaking three languages, crafted a powerful final statement. Among the participants was the late Kathy Boudin, the co-founder of Columbia's Center for Justice and an advisory committee member of the INFIW, who underscored the need for restorative justice approaches that move beyond punishment.

INFIW quickly looked beyond the Americas to build relationships in Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. 

At the 2023 Bogota gathering, the network also finalized their structure, constituting a democratic decision-making body that is currently a 15-member advisory committee of people from five continents. A unified force emerged that focused on movement building, advocacy and campaigns, changing narratives, economic empowerment, education and training, and self-care, with a mission to transform pain into collective power. 

Amid the global rise in women's incarceration, which has outpaced that of men, INFIW members opted to consolidate their power to challenge and resist the carceral juggernaut. Their determination to take this action was fortified by the absence of the political will to implement the Bangkok Rules, a potentially transformative set of guidelines officially known as the “Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders,” which was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 2010. 

The historical roots of the organizations in the network extended deep into the 20th century, as far back as the 1992 founding of Sisters Inside in Australia. Like many of the INFIW member organizations, Sisters Inside arose from the experience of one person who had been through the system and realized that change would only come when those directly impacted stepped to the front. 

In Australia that person was Debbie Kilroy, who had been through a cycle of domestic violence, poverty, and incarceration until her close friend was murdered in the Boggo Road Gaol in Queensland. That killing prompted Kilroy to reflect on the conditions that led to this tragedy. When she looked around the prison, she saw women repeatedly traumatized by poverty, racism, domestic violence, and police abuse. In response, Kilroy and several Aboriginal women in the prison began Sisters Inside. 

Over the past three decades Sisters Inside has grown a presence across Australia, visiting women in all prisons including remote rural prisons, initiating mounting critiques of abuse by prison guards and carving pathways to success for women when they do get out. 

 “We share our knowledge, especially regarding the intersectionality of colonialism, racial capitalism, and the oppression that Indigenous women and girls are confronted with daily.”

Kilroy herself is a prime example of such personal transformation. After the murder of her close friend, she changed course, completing a degree in social work, then going on to defy the odds and become one of the first formerly incarcerated women to attend and finish law school. She has now been a practicing attorney for nearly two decades. Her clients are primarily women inside prisons and those who have been released. In the course of that work, she connected with Angela Davis, and built a partnership that became an important influence on the International Network. 

“We share our knowledge, especially regarding the intersectionality of colonialism, racial capitalism, and the oppression that Indigenous women and girls are confronted with daily,” Kilroy told Truthout. “Our liberation is inherently bound together as we fight for a collective future free from the prison industrial complex.” For Kilroy and her organization, asserting the leading role of Aboriginal women in Sisters Inside has been paramount. “We've been able to connect with Aboriginal communities across the globe, learning from their struggles and aspirations.” 

After nine years in prison, Claudia Cardona landed a job at Corporación Humanas to work on the topic of women, drugs, and prison. “I was charged with using my freedom to fight for that of others. Having been on the inside, I knew this would have to be a collective struggle, so I started by calling other formerly incarcerated women who were struggling to put their lives back together,” she said. This meant teaching women “that this is about having strength and to be able to fight against the system because the system is wrong.” 

Cardona focused on making people understand that when we are imprisoning a woman, it is not only the woman who loses her freedom — it also impacts her family. “By affecting the family you affect and impact the community in general.” She led the formation of an organization in her community called Mujeres Libres (Free Women) which leads major policy campaigns. 

In 2022, Mujeres Libres pressured the Colombian government to pass the Menstrual Health in Prison Act, which guaranteed free menstrual materials to incarcerated people. The following year the government issued Decree 2292, which allowed some convicted women to receive a public service sentence in place of prison. Cardona catapulted from Mujeres Libres to the National Commission for Monitoring the Unconstitutional State of Affairs in Penitentiary and Prison Matters, a coalition of civil society organizations that researches human rights violations in the prison system and brings its findings before Colombia's Constitutional Court.

Like Kilroy, Cardona's work brought international connections, largely with other women from Latin America such as México's Betty Maldonado. After completing her prison term, Maldonado became a leader of Mujeres Unidas por la Libertad (Women United for Freedom), also a member of INFIW. 

“What we don't want is for a criminal record to become a life sentence,” she told Truthout. The work of Mujeres Unidas por la Libertad extends deep into the personal lives of their members. “We get women who are pregnant and we take them to the hospital so they can give birth. We have women that have been sexually abused … we also see some homeless women, women that don't have anywhere to go. They live on the street. So we're researchers to see where women who used to be in prison were and we are able to take them to a shelter, find help for them.” 

A major problem for people in women's prisons in México is pre-trial delays. According to Maldonado, people can wait years in jail before their case even gets to court. They essentially disappear inside the system. In one renowned instance, Daniel García and Reyes Alpízar spent 17 years awaiting trial. That is why Maldonado stresses the effort her members put into their work. “We work Monday to Sunday,” she told Truthout. Like Cardona, Maldonado believes the progress of formerly incarcerated women is tied to a fight for “human rights of women, lesbians, nonbinary, Indigenous, migrants.” 

Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe, Susan Kigula had been busy fighting her case and building connections with women across the continent. Kigula fought her way out from under her legalized death threat, getting her sentence reduced to 20 years.

By the time of her release Kigula had finished a law degree and was ready to take on the death penalty again. While she built an international profile in her death penalty work she started the Sunny African Children's Center, which provides housing and education for children of women incarcerated in Uganda. 

She shared her vision of the International Network with Truthout: “My hope [is] to engage in global partnerships. The network might aim to forge partnerships with governments, with NGOs, with corporate entities, with other civil societies to tackle global challenges and inspire more systematic changes.” 

Kigula also views the network as a future reservoir of resources to “help formerly incarcerated women rebuild their lives and integrate back into society…once the network moves to a global recognition status and drives change,” then she believes “it'll promote more social justice, human rights, and community empowerment.” 

While all network members share a deep commitment to women inside and those released from prison, the strength of the INFIW lies in the diversity of political perspectives and experiences that each member brings. These varying visions are not a source of division but of richness, allowing the network to weave together different ideas into a collective vision and a shared pathway forward. 

For example, INFIW leaders from Brazil bring an additional political component to the organization. Coming from a very politicized society with a developed working-class movement, Ana Tonini, who was incarcerated for 13 years, calls for the Network to develop a critique of capitalism and to consider Marxism as a political framework. She and fellow Brazilian Patricia Mendes told Truthout that they both query the use of “women” in the title of the network, since they know that many of the members identify as trans and nonbinary. 

On the other hand, Haitian representatives to the INFIW, Cassandra Altinor and Lynette Peregrina, prioritize a different approach. Largely because a nexus of crises, natural disasters and centuries of underdevelopment have ravaged their neighborhoods. They lean more toward fundraising to provide assistance to women who have come out of prison and are struggling with necessities. 

A common thread through the network is addressing the narrative about women who have been incarcerated and often further criminalized by family and community members. Altinor said that she was “obliged to move to another area because the people in my former community … considered us formerly incarcerated women as criminals. They do not talk to us,” said Altinor. “People were always saying that we're bad people, we're criminals. That's the most difficult part for me,” Altinor recounted. “The state, the government doesn't help us at all.” 

Akosua Akuffo of Zambia echoes Altinor's views. Akuffo spent years battling substances. But on her last prison bid, she transformed and began to analyze her position in society and the community. “I think this is high time that people understand that we're women, we are mothers, we are children, we are sisters, we are aunts, and we deserve a second chance to build our lives. We deserve to go back into society and earn money to feed our children. Otherwise, what are you encouraging us to do? You're encouraging us to go back. So we need to speak up to end the stigma and ensure that future generations do not have to go through what we have gone through.”

Not surprisingly, changing the narrative about incarcerated women is one of the five major goals of the INFIW. As Akuffo sees it, “I feel like right now we have at least been included to the table, but more can be done to change policy reform … more can be done to amplify our voices and really change the narrative of formerly incarcerated people,” Akuffo said. “And this is where we see the network going, talking about it and saying that people who go to prison are human beings.”   

Dawn Harrington, a formerly incarcerated woman from the U.S., came to a similar conclusion. She realized when she met people who had been incarcerated in women's prisons in other countries that “there were significant similarities between us no matter where we were … the more we connected the more [we realized] we can actually build solidarity together.” Ireland's Paula Kearney agreed. She saw the network as a guard against that isolation because … “a lot of us are living in our own little bubbles and tend to stay quite local … our research has really shown that there are a lot of similarities across all of our paths,” she said. “A lot of times we don't realize that that's not just in our little circles because we tend to look at what's going on in our own countries.”

“We deserve a second chance to build our lives. We deserve to go back into society and earn money to feed our children.”

Being from the United States, Harrington found the work of the network made her deeply aware of the imperialist policies and practices “from the U.S. that were being exported.” Harrington comes from Nashville, Tennessee, which was the birthplace of the first private prison company, known originally as Corrections Corporation of America. (In 2016 they changed their name to CoreCivic.) 

As private prisons came under fire in the U.S. and began to reduce their profile, Harrington discovered through the network that internationally these corporations are expanding. And today, they are experiencing a boomerang-like resurgence, with stocks rising in response to the growth of immigration crackdown and detention. This reality underscores the urgent need for global solidarity across movements and intersections: Our struggles are interconnected, and an injury to one is an injury to all.

For Harrington, the 2023 gathering in Bogotá was “like pouring fuel on the fire that was about to happen.” While developing the declaration and its structure was essential, Harrington recognized a beautiful challenge in internal debates, ultimately guiding the adoption as a principle, to “unapologetically commit to end the incarceration of women and girls, period.” In the words of Toni Tulloch, a Jamaican woman who spent 16.5 years in U.S. prisons and was subsequently deported, and now serves as the international organizer for the INFIW, “we're gonna have to change the whole structure of how incarceration for women is dealt with and just basically find the keys that it takes to unlock the door to stop this madness.”

While women's prisons make up a small percentage of the world's incarcerated population, the people coming out of these prisons have moved front and center in politicizing issues of incarceration. According to Debbie Kilroy, “it's about bringing everybody on a journey to end the incarceration of women and girls, whether it's intellectually within our hearts or in our practice with our hands.” Kilroy said she talks a lot about how “head, heart, and hands have to be connected … Because if we can't feed ourselves, we can't have an intellectual analysis of what's happening with the prison industrial complex or racial capitalism. But if our bellies are full and our hearts are warm because we're somewhere safe, we can actually start to strategically think about what we can do.… But it's about having those three parts of us as human beings connected to be able to do the work to move forward.” 

For the members of INFIW that pathway forward includes international solidarity. With its global reach and leadership of directly impacted people, the INFIW has created a model that can reshape our notions of liberation and undermine any and all efforts to extend the boundaries of empire and the carceral state everywhere that it exists around the world. Toni Tulloch projected this vision into the network's future: “We're going to continue to demolish the system. We're going little by little. We're going to … tear down this structure because it's necessary.” 

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

TikTok video shows woman speaking into camera and reacting to a loud thud before she says ‘I just hit somebody'

Authorities are investigating a newly surfaced video that suggests a woman who hit and killed a man while driving in the Chicago suburb of Zion, Illinois, on Monday night was livestreaming on TikTok at the time of the crash.

The video in question was reportedly taken by a user in Zion, and it shows a woman behind the wheel of a car reacting to a loud thud by saying, “Fuck, fuck, fuck … I just hit somebody.”

According to the Lake and McHenry County Scanner, which first reported on the video, the Zion police department investigations commander, Lt Paul Kehrli, said drugs and alcohol were not suspected of being factors in Monday's crash, and the driver involved – a 43-year-old woman – remained at the scene to speak with authorities.

The Lake county state's attorney's office told the Scanner on Friday afternoon that the agency had been made aware of the video but could not comment further because of a pending investigation. The office stopped short of indicating exactly who made the agency aware of the video.

Studies through the years have attributed cellphone use while driving to an increase in the potential for serious crashes – or worse.

A screen recording of a TikTok live video streamed on Monday was then published on the social media app on Friday morning, and it showed user “Tea_Tyme_3” speaking at her phone before a loud thud. The live stream was quickly disconnected after the thud prompted her to curse, a child to ask what happened and someone else to ask the driver if she was OK.

The user, it has been reported, has since changed her name and made her account private, deleting the biography section in which she had previously described being in Zion, Illinois.

A thread on the Reddit platform separately was started by a user who described seeing the video when it was livestreamed and wondering whether something deadly had happened. News stories later confirmed that user's worst fears, as the user put it.

“It feels like I accidentally witnessed the moment someone's life was taken and now I can't stop thinking about the victim, and how avoidable it was,” the user said. “I just keep replaying that sound in my head.”

The user also said the person driving while on TikTok “wasn't paying attention to the road because she was reading comments and grinning at her phone”.

“A man died because she wanted attention from a livestream,” the Reddit user also wrote.

Monday's crash occurred at about 5.30pm, police said. Darren Lucas, 59, of nearby Beach Park, was unresponsive after being hit, and he was later pronounced dead at a hospital emergency room from blunt force injuries inflicted on him by the crash, the local coroner's office said in a statement.

Lucas's son-in-law, Chris King, told the Lake and McHenry County Scanner that news of the video made his family “hold our loss tighter to our hearts”.

“We … will continue to pray for what the driver must be going through,” King reportedly said. “We are trying to find our ways to live, without someone we cherished so much.”

All thermal power plants (TPP) operated by Ukraine's state-owned energy company Centrenergo are down following "the largest Russian attack" which targeted all of them, the company announced on Nov. 8.

According to the company, the same thermal power plants that had been restored after attacks in 2024 were struck again, with multiple Russian drones targeting them "each minute" overnight on Nov. 8.

Ukrainian forces downed 406 out of the 458 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Russia also launched 45 cruise and ballistic missiles, nine of which were downed, the statement said.

Centrenergo operates three thermal power plants, which were essentially all the company's assets: Trypillia in Kyiv Oblast, Zmiivska in Kharkiv Oblast, and Vuhlehirska in Donetsk Oblast.

Last spring, Centrenergo announced that the Zmiivska thermal power plant had beed completely destroyed. On July 25, 2022, Russian troops occupied the Vuhlehirska thermal power plant.

The recent attack destroyed all restored capacity, leaving the plants generating no power, the company said.

"For safety reasons, we remained silent, but we did everything possible to ensure that Ukrainians got through the last winter with electricity and heat, overcoming hellish challenges to successfully start the current heating season," Centrenergo said.

"Less than a month has passed since the previous strike, and last night the enemy again hit all of our power generation facilities simultaneously."

Throughout the fall, Russia has intensified attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure as it attempts to plunge the country into yet another harsh winter. One of the worst strikes on Oct. 3 and 5 wiped out around 60% of Ukraine's gas production sites.

During the Nov. 8 attack Russia primarily targeted the cities of Kremenchuk in Poltava Oblast, Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv, causing emergency power cuts in several regions.

As tens of thousands of military personnel work without pay and others are furloughed, a local pantry sees its numbers increasing as restaurants are losing customers

When Jane Doorley and her husband Bill arrived at the Fairborn Fish Food Pantry they help run on 28 October, they couldn't get into the parking lot, such was the number of cars belonging to people seeking food.

“Our numbers are way up. Last Friday was really bad too,” says Jane. “Around 250 families, including 300 children, come to the pantry every day it's open.”

The pantry is situated a half mile from Wright-Patterson air force base – the largest single-site employer in Ohio with 38,000 workers – outside Dayton, Ohio, which has been rocked by the federal government shutdown.

With tens of thousands of military personnel working without pay, and local contractors and civilian workers furloughed, the wider regional economy is in trouble.

About 8,100 civilian workers at the Air Force Material Command, headquartered at the Wright-Patterson air force base, have received furlough notices, according to local media.

The effects of this are being starkly seen at food resource centers.

“In September, we were probably averaging 250 families a week. This week, I anticipate we'll probably help 500 families,” says Doorley.

“We're seeing this heightened anxiety. You can just feel it when people come. Everybody wants to come at the beginning [of the day], for fear that the food is going to run out.”

For decades, the military has been regarded as a stable source of employment, even through recessions and other economic crises. For a part of the industrial midwest that's never fully recovered from the collapse of manufacturing activity in the late 20th century, the air force base has been a lifeline, fueling an additional 40,000 off-base, indirect jobs.

Every year, the base generates nearly $16bn for the local economy. Dotted along streets outside the facility, which spans 8,000 acres, are dozens of military-adjacent and defense companies such as Lockheed Martin, GE Aviation and Northrop Grumman, which have provided decades of stable employment, largely through contracts from the federal government that are paid for by taxpayers. Startups such as Joby Aviation have recently flocked to the area to take advantage of access to air force facilities and intellectual property.

But now, local businesses are feeling the full effect of the shutdown.

“We've really lost most of our customers because of the government shutdown. It used to be really busy but now it's empty,” says Tik Taew, who works at Tik's Thai Express, a restaurant located a short distance from the base that's been in business for more than 15 years.

“Weekday mornings are usually our busiest time, but right now, it's really quiet; we're only getting five to six [customers].”

Across the country, around three-fourths of a million civilians work with the US military. Around half are thought to have been currently furloughed. Reports from the Trump administration made public on 4 November suggested many of those furloughed may not be legible for back-pay, or that it could be used as a negotiating tactic with Democratic party leaders working to end the shutdown.

Democrats have refused to sign a funding deal to end the shutdown unless subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, which provides medical care at a reduced cost for millions of Americans, is renewed into 2026, a measure the White House opposes.

While a last-minute measure late last month saw the Trump administration pull together $5.3bn to ensure military service members were paid on 1 November, avoiding an historic first, experts say service members are unlikely to be paid at the next payroll date if a deal isn't reached.

“[B]y November 15 our troops and service members who are willing to risk their lives aren't going to be able to get paid,” the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told Face the Nation on 26 October.

Polls show that more Americans blame Trump and the Republican party than Democrats for the shutdown, which is now the longest in US history. And yet, a plurality of voters in Ohio, Greene county, where the base is situated, members of the air force and military veterans as a whole, broadly vote for Republican political candidates.

The air force base isn't the only large military entity in the Dayton area to be closed by the shutdown.

The National Museum of the US Air Force, the world's largest military aviation museum that's adjacent to the air force base has also been closed since 1 October. More than 66,000 people from around the country visit the museum every month, adding millions of dollars to the local economy by staying at local hotels and dining at restaurants.

Local county authorities are having to add millions of additional dollars to support food banks. The Dayton Foodbank, which includes a network of 122 local pantries, has delivered 500 emergency food boxes to the base since the start of the shutdown.

“While base civilians, who are still unpaid during the shutdown, might be living above poverty levels while receiving a paycheck, they may not have the funds needed easily available via savings or a credit card in the case of an emergency like now,” says Lee Lauren Truesdale of the Dayton Foodbank.

One local restaurant is offering a $5 menu to military members to help them offset the financial strain. Others are giving away free cooked meals.

“While going unpaid, these civilian employees still must pay day to day expenses such as rent, daycare (to hold spots in anticipation of returning to work), buy food, pay medical bills, car bills [and] utilities.”

All the while, the Trump White House has worked to undermine these groups.

Thousands of pantries across the country, including the Fairborn Fish Food Pantry, used to receive financial support worth a total of $117m through the federal government's Emergency Food and Shelter Program, but that was taken away in January.

“That's on a pause, probably forever,” says Doorley. “We [now] rely entirely on donations.”

At the Fairborn Fish Food Pantry, which has initiated dedicated days for military families, Doorley says meat is the number one sought after commodity.

“The donations have increased a little bit, but we go and buy meat for 500 families a week. That is not sustainable for us,” she says, adding that it's time for politicians in Washington DC to find a solution.

“It's time for the two sides to recognize that we are all Americans and we have people who are hungry and need help. [They need to] get together and somehow find a middle ground to move things forward and help those in our community.”

Editor's note: The story was updated to include an additional statement from law enforcement. 

The commander of a Ukrainian unmanned systems battalion was charged with negligence after holding an award ceremony for soldiers in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast earlier this month, despite a ban.

The military gathering was hit by Russia, the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) said on Nov. 7.

The strike killed 12 servicemen and seven civilians, while 36 others were injured, according to the Prosecutor General's Office. 

According to the investigators, the officer organized on Nov. 1 a formal assembly and award ceremony for over 100 servicemen in front-line areas of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, including locations where civilians were present.

Although the General Staff had prohibited such gatherings, the commander neither halted the event nor dispersed the soldiers during an air raid alert, the SBI said.

At that time, Russia reportedly struck the assembly points with three Geran drones and two Iskander missiles.

Earlier, the 30th Marine Corps, which includes the 35th Marine Brigade, confirmed that its service members had been targeted in the recent Russian attack.

Kostiantyn Huzenko, Ukrainian photographer and serviceman with the 35th Separate Marine Brigade, was also killed in the strike, Huzenko's friends told the Kyiv Independent.

A court in Dnipro took the commander into custody, the SBI said later on Nov. 8.

If found guilty, he could face up to eight years in prison. 

Similar incidents have happened before, where Russia killed elite Ukrainian soldiers during award ceremonies in front-line areas. This Soviet-era practice has been criticized by both President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian military.

Following a series of Russian attacks on training grounds and military centers, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi announced in July that gathering troops and equipment or stationing soldiers in tent camps is banned.

Draft template seen by the Guardian has no reference to countries receiving benefits for sharing information, such as guaranteed access to medicines developed as a result





The US wants countries to agree to hand over information on bugs that could cause large-scale disease outbreaks in return for restoring aid to tackle health problems such as HIV and malaria, according to government documents.

The Trump administration is seeking new bilateral aid agreements with dozens of countries, after an abrupt withdrawal from existing arrangements at the start of this year. The agreements form part of a new America First Global Health Strategy announced in September.

A draft template seen by the Guardian, to be used for memorandums of understanding with partner countries, offers funding to tackle diseases such as malaria, TB, HIV and polio, as well as for activities such as surveillance, and laboratory systems and electronic health records.

It suggests that countries will be expected to gradually take over funding these areas themselves over the course of the five-year agreements.

In return, it includes conditions requiring countries to share biological specimens and genetic sequences of “pathogens with epidemic potential” with the US, within days of their identification.

The move risks undermining global efforts to bring a new pandemic agreement into force and ensure countries get fair access to vaccines, treatments and diagnostics, advocates said.

A full specimen-sharing agreement – envisaged as a 25-year commitment – is still being drafted, the memorandum says, but there is no reference in the current document to countries receiving any specific benefits for sharing, such as guaranteed access to medicines developed as a result.

Access to those benefits proved a key sticking point in negotiations for the pandemic agreement, reached earlier this year, governing how the world will respond to future outbreaks. Developing countries fear a repeat of the Covid-19 pandemic when they struggled to access the vaccines and medicines that became available.

A decision on that element of pandemic response – a “pathogen access and benefit sharing” (Pabs) system – was pushed back for further negotiations. The system will form an annex to the main agreement, but must be in place before the agreement opens for signatures.

The draft memorandum and accompanying technical guidance also suggests that countries will be expected to recognise approval of drugs by US regulators as meeting domestic regulatory requirements, particularly where there are “large domestic markets [or] other strategic reasons”.

News of the draft US memorandum broke as country and civil society representatives gathered in Geneva for talks on the proposed Pabs system.

Michel Kazatchkine, on behalf of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, said: “In our view, these bilateral agreements will undermine the multilateral system. They will bypass the World Health Organization and the foundations of solidarity and equity we have been trying to build here.

“The template offers no guarantees of access to countermeasures and gives commercial dominance to one country. It threatens health security, data security and, ultimately, national sovereignty.”

In a statement, the Pandemic Action Network said: “We would like to underline the importance of this multilateral process and of investing in a system that can last, of countries pulling together.

“The origin story of these negotiations got us here: every country fighting for themselves became a race to the bottom – and those that suffered were the most vulnerable.”

Shadow Fleet tanker MT Virgo returns after delivering a cargo of Iranian oil on Aug. 24, 2025. The busy shipping lanes in the South China Sea offer a logistical advantage because they are close to buyers in China and India.Remy Osman/Supplied

British expat Remy Osman has a front-row seat from which to watch the growing “shadow fleet” of vessels off Singapore filled with Russian, Iranian or Venezuelan oil in the process of evading Western sanctions.

Mr. Osman, a salesman in the Asian city-state's food and beverage industry, has built an internet following in his spare time by documenting the passage of tanker ships that in many cases are part of the illicit trade in oil.

From his apartment, armed with a camera and telephoto lens, he identifies and captures photos and videos of these vessels en route to international waters. Once out of local jurisdictions, they sidle up to another ship and transfer their hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil. 

Explainer: How a shadow fleet of tankers keeps Russian oil money flowing despite Western sanctions

One day, he documents the Russian oil tanker Krasnoyarsk passing by. It's under sanctions from the United States, Canada and other countries for helping transport petroleum for Moscow, which is waging a war against Ukraine.

Another day it's the Virgo, a tanker that's part of Iran's shadow fleet and also under U.S. sanctions.

Mr. Osman is helping put video and photo evidence to a phenomenon that shipping analysts have been documenting for some time.

The busy shipping lanes in the South China Sea offshore of Singapore and neighbouring Malaysia are a growing site for ship-to-ship transfers of oil from countries under Western sanctions, offering logistical advantages for shadow fleet vessels.

“It's kind of a Wild West zone that's geographically close to where the buyers are likely to be,” Mr. Osman said.

Growth of shadow tanker fleet slows as tightened Western sanctions target Russian oil

“It tends to be sanctioned oil from Iran, Russia and Venezuela. And then it typically tends to be transferred to buyers and shipped out to China or India.” 

It's hard for the ships, which can run as big as 330 metres in length, to evade Mr. Osman's camera lens as they transit the ocean about 10 to 15 kilometres from his apartment.

But the tremendous number of commercial vessels using these waterways means it's easier for tankers with illicit oil to blend in among all the traffic. 

Transferring the oil from countries under sanctions to another tanker helps obscure the origin, destination and ownership of the cargo. Traders also disperse oil among multiple vessels to reduce the risk of interdiction or seizure by authorities. Sometimes it is mixed with product from countries that are not under sanctions to disguise it.

Mr. Osman, who is now a permanent resident of Singapore, said he first became interested in ship spotting during the pandemic, when he was confined to a hotel for a quarantine period about five years ago. “I had nothing to do but spend hours in my hotel room looking at the sea and taking pictures of the ships.”

He looks for telltale signs of shadow fleet vessels before taking photos. First, if the AIS (automatic identification system) data being broadcast from the ship is odd – for instance, the ship is supposed to be coming from China but is pointed toward China; and second, if the vessel is flying an unusual flag. 

“If it's got a flag from an unregulated and undeveloped maritime country – if it's some random African country which doesn't really have a merchant fleet – that's usually a good clue,” Mr. Osman said.

The third criteria is whether it's an older vessel – 15 to 25 years old.

He then runs the ship registration information against Western lists of vessels under sanctions.

In an August brief, shipping intelligence provider Windward described the waters near the Riau archipelago off Singapore and eastern Malaysia as the “epicentre of maritime lawlessness on Asia's doorstep.” It said that for the past five years the area has been used by dark fleet – another term for shadow fleet – tankers as both a hub for floating storage and for ship-to-ship transfers of oil on sanctions lists. 

Windward's brief said the area is convenient because it serves as a midway point between Iran, Russia or Venezuela and “China, the biggest buyer of crude, with nearby maritime services from Singapore, Malaysia or Indonesia within a day's sailing.”

In a note to clients that same month, BRS Shipbrokers said Western sanctions by the U.S., the European Union and others may be fuelling the expansion of the “grey fleet,” or vessels engaging in illicit trading. In 2025, it said, some 30 ships per month have shifted from mainstream shipping to the Russian or Iranian market, adding that the fleet now represents 18.2 per cent of global oil tanker tonnage.

John Boscariol, head of McCarthy Tétrault's international trade and investment law group, said the illicit ship-to-ship transfers demonstrate the limitation of sanctions.

“Everyone can say, ‘Oh, we've imposed sanctions on Russia. We've listed this shadow fleet,'” he said. “But ultimately, when the shadow fleet doesn't call at Canadian or other Western ports, or companies that buy from or otherwise support the shadow fleet don't touch the jurisdiction of the United States, Canada, the EU or Britain, there's not much that can be done about it.”

Ukraine is facing widespread power outages after Russia launched a massive overnight aerial assault across the country, killing at least two people, Ukrainian authorities say.
    


            Nine Ukrainian regions came under attack, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky, with the latest assault coming as many were asleep.
    


            State energy company Centrenergo described the barrage as “the most massive strike on our thermal power plants since the beginning of the full-scale invasion.”
    


            The Russian attacks came as temperatures dropped into the single-figures celsius across Ukraine.
    


            “The enemy is once again launching massive attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure,” said energy minister Svitlana Grynchuk.
    


            Emergency power cuts had been introduced in a number of regions, she added, and would be cancelled when the power system stabilizes. Residents of Kyiv face extensive power cuts through the weekend, according to schedules published by energy companies.
    


            Two people were killed and 11 injured by a drone attack that struck a nine-story apartment building in the city of Dnipro in central Ukraine. Video captured the moment the drone struck in the darkness.
    


            “There's nothing here, just ordinary buildings,” said a woman who gave her name as Maia.
    


            “I don't know how I survived, because all the shrapnel flew onto the bed where I was sleeping,” said Larysa, another resident of the building.
    


            “We gathered quickly and started to go downstairs. People were screaming. You could already hear screams from the street,” she added.
    


            Altogether, ten people have been killed by Russian strikes in the last 24 hours, according to the Ukrainian State Emergency Service, and nearly 50 injured.
    


            Of the 45 missiles fired by Russia, some of which were ballistic weapons, the Ukrainian air force said only nine had been intercepted. Some 450 drones were also launched.
    


            “26 missiles and 52 strike UAVs [drones] have been recorded hitting 25 locations,” it said, with many of the attacks occurring in the central regions of Poltava and Dnipropetrovsk as well as Kyiv.
    


            “It is extremely difficult to counter ballistic and aero-ballistic missiles,” Zelensky said in his daily address later Saturday. “Only a few systems in the world are capable of intercepting such missiles effectively – and to protect our entire territory, we need far more of these systems and far more of the missiles for them.”
    


            The Ukrainian president said Kyiv was working with the US to purchase additional Patriots, an air defense system that has proved capable in intercepting Russian missiles.
    


            Ukraine has requested more help from allies to replenish its air defenses, as well as longer-range missiles to attack Russian energy and military facilities. Its request for US Tomahawk missiles was turned down by President Donald Trump last month.
    


            Russia's defense ministry said the strikes had come in response to Ukrainian attacks, and had included Kinzhal ballistic missiles and other weapons in strikes against “enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex and gas and energy facilities of Ukraine that supported their operations.”
    


Russian forces are poised to finally capture Pokrovsk, a symbolically important victory with a heavy cost



            The frequent attacks on energy have seriously damaged Ukrainian gas production and caused extensive power cuts across the country. Ukrainian officials have said they'll have to turn to expensive imports of European gas to make up the shortfall.
    


            “Despite the enemy's plans, Ukraine will have light and heat this winter,” said energy minister Grynchuk.
    


            The Ukrainian military and security services have also stepped up drone and missile attacks against Russian refineries and other infrastructure such as pipelines and pumping stations in recent months.
    


            On Saturday, Ukrainian drones carried out what one Russian official described as a “massive attack” on energy facilities in the Volgograd region, a frequent target of Ukraine.
    


            A substation was hit, according to Andrey Bocharov, the regional governor, who said power was restored several hours after the strike.

The U.S. granted Hungary an exemption from sanctions imposed on Russian oil and gas use following a meeting between Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Nov. 7.

"We have received a full sanctions exemption for the Turk Stream and Druzhba pipelines," Orban said. Reuters reported that the exemption was granted for one year.

Orban, a close ideological ally of Trump, has defied pressure to halt purchases of Russian oil and gas. After the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russian energy giants Lukoil and Rosneft in late October, Orban said Hungary looked for ways to "circumvent" the restrictions.

Orban, a close Trump ally and widely seen as Putin's closest partner in the EU, has maintained ties with Moscow despite the war and has repeatedly portrayed Ukraine as a threat to Hungary's security and economy.

Trump told the media he was "looking at" granting Hungary an exception from Russian oil sanctions in response to Budapest's plea. He added that he was "very disturbed" that there are other European countries that have not fully cut off Russian oil imports.

"Sure, we're looking at it, because it's very difficult for (Orban) to get the oil and gas from other areas," Trump said alongside the Hungarian leader. "As you know, they don't have the advantage of having sea. It's a great country, it's a big country, but they don't have sea. They don't have the ports. And so they have a difficult problem."

The two countries also reached a nuclear fuel deal with Westinghouse to supply nuclear fuel for Hungary's Paks I power plant, and Budapest would buy U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) to diversify its energy supplies.

Orban and Trump also discussed Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, as the two seek to portray themselves as mediators in peace efforts. According to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, Budapest is ready to host possible peace talks "once the preparations are complete."

When asked by reporters if the two leaders agree on methods to push Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, Trump said that "I think we agree that the war is (going to) end in the not too distant future," with Orban adding that he has "some ideas" to present to Trump.

The planned Trump–Putin summit in Budapest was canceled in October shortly after being announced.

"If there is a meeting — wherever it may take place — that can genuinely lead to a ceasefire and an end to the war, Ukraine will support any such format," President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier on Nov. 7. "But if these meetings are only meant as an 'electoral fireworks show' for Orban and produce no real results, then we can't support them."

The Kizlyar Electromechanical Plant produces equipment for Russian Sukhoi and MiG aircraft and has been sanctioned for its role in the war against Ukraine. 

Russia launched yet another wide-ranging attack on Ukrainian cities overnight on Nov. 8, using a combination of drone and missiles to strike targets across the country.

The recent Russian attack destroyed all restored capacity, leaving the plants generating no power, the state-owned energy company Centrenergo said on Nov. 8.





 As winter approaches and Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy system intensify, a small unit from the 3rd Army Corps spends sleepless nights hunting long-range Shahed drones on the front line in Kharkiv Oblast — before they reach Ukrainian cities.

The Russian strike killed 12 servicemen and seven civilians, while 36 others were injured, according to the Prosecutor General's Office. 

Russia carried out a drone attack on the city of Dnipro overnight on Nov. 8, killing at least three people and injuring 12 others, including two children, officials reported.

Ukrainian forces downed 406 out of the 458 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Russia also launched 45 cruise and ballistic missiles, nine of which were downed, the statement said. 

The number includes 1,190 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

"We have received a full sanctions exemption for the Turk Stream and Druzhba pipelines," Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said. Reuters reported that the exemption was granted for one year.



"He was the head of a large system, and this system was supposed to ensure the security of our energy sector. He was obliged to do this — and he did not," the president told journalists on Nov. 7.

MOSCOW, November 5. /TASS/. Russia and China agree to deepen cooperation in trade and energy; Washington struggles for influence over Kiev and its allies as it tries to steer conflict with Russia to an end; and the United States proposes creating an international security force in Gaza to facilitate demilitarization. These stories topped Wednesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Russia and China will modernize border checkpoints and expand the list of goods permitted for cross-border transport, according to the communique issued following the 30th regular meeting of the heads of government of the two countries, Mikhail Mishustin and Li Qiang. The agenda also includes shifting the structure of bilateral trade toward agricultural products and primary processed goods, Izvestia writes. In Beijing, Mishustin was also received by Chinese President Xi Jinping. During their meeting, the sides agreed to create conditions to attract investment, provide each other with firm mutual support, and deepen cooperation in high-tech sectors.

On the economic front, Moscow and Beijing agreed to improve the structure of bilateral trade, making use of the growth potential in areas such as e-commerce, agriculture, and primary processed products. In addition, the governments of Russia and China supported expanding air travel between the two countries.

"Such meetings make it possible to touch base, synchronize positions and discuss the most pressing issues, serving as an additional communication channel between national leaders," Junior Research Fellow at the Sector of Economy and Politics of China of the Center for Asia Pacific Studies at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Andrey Fedotov told Izvestia.

Notably, the Russian prime minister's visit took place after negotiations between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. Moscow and Beijing share a similar position on many global and regional issues. In particular, the two are opposed to the United States wielding unfettered power globally, Fedotov noted.

Talks with the Chinese leader also provided an opportunity to discuss the main areas of Russia-China cooperation. The central pillar remains energy trade. In 2024, China imported approximately 213 mln metric tons of oil and 246 bln cubic meters of natural gas from Russia - 1.8% and 6.2% higher, respectively, than the previous year.

During Vladimir Putin's visit to China on September 2, 2025, Russia's Gazprom and China's CNPC signed a legally binding memorandum on the construction of the Power of Siberia-2 gas pipeline through Mongolia. The implementation of this large-scale project will in the coming years allow Russia to increase gas exports to China to up to 50 bln cubic meters annually.

Igor Yushkov, Leading Analyst at the National Energy Security Fund and Expert at the Financial University under the Russian Government, told Izvestia that Russia has enough resources to build five such pipelines. At existing fields alone, Gazprom can produce around 100 bln cubic meters, and additional volumes have become available due to reduced supplies to the EU.

"I believe that, in the end, the project will be built, the question is when and under what conditions. Certain parameters of the commercial contract are still being finalized, as is the issue of financing," the expert emphasized.

 

On the day when the European "coalition of the willing" convened in Madrid, where discussion was expected to include a 12-point peace plan prepared jointly with Ukraine, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker arrived in Kiev. During his meeting with Vladimir Zelensky, he posited that the only viable scenario for resolving the military conflict with Russia would be one led by US President Donald Trump. Zelensky himself stated the day before that he had not seen a finalized plan from Europe, even though he and European leaders had just recently outlined its key points. Experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta argue that Washington may be seeking to ease escalation after Russia's recent strategic weapons tests, but acknowledge that it lacks leverage over both Kiev and its European allies.

According to the newspaper, since his inauguration on January 20, Donald Trump has periodically signaled a willingness to take into account the considerations of Russian negotiators regarding the outlines of a peace deal. Russia's position is and always has been that an immediate ceasefire would merely allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to regroup and maneuver, creating the risk of renewed hostilities. However, the US president has subsequently once again declared an immediate ceasefire to be a necessary move.

At the same time, on October 22, the US Treasury announced new sanctions against two Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Meanwhile, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker stated in an interview in recent days that he had discussed additional options for exerting pressure on Russia during a meeting with CIA Director John Ratcliffe.

Commenting on these divergent statements for Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Evgeny Semibratov, Deputy Director of the Institute for Strategic Studies and Forecasts of the Peoples' Friendship University, suggested that Russian President Putin's recent announcement about successful tests of the unlimited-range Burevestnik cruise missile and the Poseidon nuclear-powered underwater vehicle likely had an impact on Washington's thinking. Given their characteristics, both developments could pose a direct threat to the United States. Under these circumstances, it would be reasonable for Washington to try to reduce the level of escalation. Yet, any step toward Moscow would be depicted in Western media as a concession and a sign of personal weakness on Trump's part - an outcome that doesn't mesh with his political agenda.

In addition, Semibratov continued, the current US administration may lack sufficient leverage to influence either Western globalist circles as a whole, including the United Kingdom, or Zelensky himself. Given this, the UK, aware that Washington is weak on the details of the settlement, are deliberately seeking to complicate the negotiation process in order to push the United States to align with their position and turn up the heat on Moscow. If Russia rejects such a proposal, it could then be accused of derailing yet another round of negotiations. However, attempts to advance new initiatives that disregard Russia's security conditions will only further accelerate escalation.

 

The administration of US President Donald Trump has submitted to the UN Security Council a draft resolution to establish the International Stabilization Force (ISF) for a two-year mandate, with the possibility of extension, Axios reported citing a document obtained by the outlet. These armed contingents would not perform a peacekeeping function; instead, they would focus on securing Gaza's borders with Israel and Egypt, protecting civilians and humanitarian corridors, and training new Palestinian police forces. Discussions on the document are expected to begin in the near future. Experts interviewed by Vedomosti argue that while Washington seeks a multinational force to disarm Hamas, Israel currently has no incentive to accept such a plan, and disarmament remains impossible without progress toward Palestinian statehood, which remains unlikely.

The duties of the international forces would include the disarmament of the Palestinian radical group Hamas. According to the draft resolution, foreign contingents would work to stabilize the situation in the Gaza Strip and ensure the region's demilitarization.

It remains unclear which nations will contribute troops to the ISF, Vedomosti writes. Potential participants may include military personnel from Azerbaijan, Indonesia, and Turkey under the overall command of Egypt, The Guardian reported. The Israeli news portal Ynet suggested that military personnel from Indonesia, Azerbaijan, and Pakistan may be involved.

Conditions for the deployment of an international military contingent in Gaza are not yet in place, Doctor of Political Science at the University of Salzburg Kamran Hasanov told Vedomosti. First, despite the ceasefire, clashes between Israeli forces and Islamist fighters still periodically erupt in the enclave. Second, Israel is currently unwilling to allow the entry of international forces into Gaza as it categorically rejects the presence of Turkish troops there, the political scientist pointed out.

"Trump is counting on Ankara's assistance to implement his strategy. But Israel has already secured the release of hostages and therefore has no incentive to comply with the American plan. Otherwise, it risks a political crisis for Netanyahu's cabinet. For their part, the Americans have no incentive to pressure their Israeli allies so long as the region remains relatively stable," he said.

According to Hasanov, Hamas is interested in the deployment of peacekeepers only insofar as it hampers Israeli occupation of territory. However, the issue of disarmament remains inseparable from the question of establishing a Palestinian state - and such an outcome, the expert concluded, still appears unlikely.

 

Arab countries are seeking to play a more integral role in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Head of the Mission of the League of Arab States (LAS) in Russia Valid Hamid Shiltag told Izvestia. He noted that Arab nations view their interaction with the SCO positively and are already participating in its meetings. Closer engagement would strengthen the organization's potential as one of the key centers of global development and would provide Russia with new avenues for growth.

Arab states could play a more visible role in the SCO, Shiltag said. According to him, expanding cooperation with the organization creates new opportunities for the region in international diplomacy and economic development.

"The League of Arab States and Arab countries as a whole take a positive view of cooperation with the SCO, as well as with BRICS. Some countries are already participating in meetings, and there are states that would also like to become part of these associations," the diplomat emphasized.

"Many countries express a desire to take part in order to expand their economic ties, and in this sphere, there are no rigid boundaries between countries. What matters here are shared interests. Arab states can take on a more active role in the SCO," the ambassador noted.

The region's intention to expand its involvement in the SCO is primarily linked to economic integration, the newspaper writes. Arab states believe they will fit naturally into the organization's economic mechanisms and complement its existing cooperation formats. Today, the SCO covers about 60% of Eurasian territory, and more than 3.4 bln people live in its member nations - nearly half of the world's population. The combined GDP of its participants exceeds $23 trillion. This scale makes the organization quite attractive for Middle East countries, Izvestia writes.

Strengthening ties between the SCO and the Arab world goes beyond symbolic gestures and is developing into a strategic path reflecting a broader trend toward a multipolar world order, Saudi political analyst Mubarak Al-Aati told the newspaper.

"An organization that includes a quarter of the global economy and more than half of the world's population provides Middle Eastern states with opportunities to enhance national security, expand economic ties, and make room for foreign-policy maneuver. At the same time, the success of their participation in this format will largely depend on the ability of Arab countries to articulate their own vision of engagement," the expert said.

 

The new US sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil did not have a substantial impact on the volume of Russian oil exports in October. Month-on-month, seaborne shipments declined by 1.2%, but longer delivery chains and widening discounts were observed. The sanctions could potentially have a greater impact after November 21, when the waivers for transactions with Rosneft and Lukoil expire, Kommersant writes.

Seaborne exports of Russian oil in October decreased month-on-month by 1.2% to 470,000 metric tons per day, according to a review by the Center for Price Indices. China accounted for 34% of shipments, India for 29%, Turkey for 14%, and Egypt and Syria together for 17%. The share of destinations listed as "unknown" amounted to 5%.

Maritime shipments of Russian oil to China declined by 7.5% in October, to 159,000 metric tons per day, with ESPO making up about 98% of volumes and Urals comprising the remainder, the Center for Price Indices noted.

Analysts do not view this decline in deliveries as critical, pointing out that in September there were two weeks of record shipments to China - 171,000 metric tons per day. Seaborne exports of Russian oil to India increased by 6.9% to 138,000 metric tons per day, and to Turkey - by 8% to 67,000 metric tons per day.

However, according to market participants cited by the Center for Price Indices, Turkish buyers have already begun searching for alternative suppliers due to the expanded list of Russian oil companies subject to US restrictions after Rosneft and Lukoil were added to the SDN List.

Kirill Bakhtin, Head of the Russian Equities Center at BCS World of Investments, told Kommersant that companies had sufficient time to prepare and develop alternative supply schemes. He said that purchases of Russian oil continue, but increasingly through intermediaries. The full effect of the sanctions will be clearer after November 21, when the transition period ends, the analyst added.

The Center for Price Indices expects average Brent crude prices to decline from $69 per barrel in 2025 to $64 per barrel the following year, due to rising production by OPEC+ countries outpacing the growth in global demand.

            Russian forces appear to be on the brink of finally seizing the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, a symbolic victory that President Vladimir Putin has been pursuing for 21 months at an increasingly heavy cost.
    


            Fighting inside the city has intensified in the past few days, after Russian troops successfully infiltrated it. The fall of Pokrovsk – the strategic value of which has already been greatly diminished but would nevertheless represent the biggest win for Moscow since 2023 – now seems almost inevitable, according to those on the ground.
    


            While Kyiv denied Russian claims that Ukrainian forces in Pokrovsk have already been surrounded, saying on Wednesday that active operations stopping the Russian advance were still ongoing, Ukrainian soldiers on the ground have described an increasingly grim reality.
    


            “The situation is difficult, with all types of fighting going on, firefights in urban areas, and shelling with all types of weapons,” one battalion commander told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity for security reasons.
    


            “We are almost surrounded, but we are used to it,” he said. Another soldier, who also asked for his name to be withheld for safety reasons, told CNN the Russian military continues to press forward with large numbers of men.
    


            “The intensity of their movements is so great that (Ukrainian) drone operators simply cannot keep up with the pace. The Russians often move in groups of three, counting on the fact that two will be destroyed, but one will still reach the city and gain a foothold there. About a hundred such groups can pass through in a day,” a soldier from the Ukrainian Peaky Blinders drone unit told CNN.
    


            The claim that Russia is willing to sacrifice two soldiers in order to get one through might seem perplexing – but it tallies up with observations made by international researchers who have noted a very high number of Russian casualties around Pokrovsk, even though taking over the city won't make much difference on the ground.
    


            That's because the battle for Pokrovsk is no longer a fight for a strategically important logistics hub. Instead, it has now morphed into a symbolic battle.
    


            “From (a) battlefield perspective, it doesn't make sense,” said George Barros, who leads the Russia and Geospatial Intelligence teams at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank.
    


            Pokrovsk was long seen as a key city for the Ukrainians, because of its road and rail connections. It sits on a junction of several major roads, leading to Donetsk and Kostyantynivka in the east and Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia to the west.
    


            “It was operationally significant because it was a supply line that supported the Ukrainian logistics, which then fanned out and supported the other Ukrainian tactical positions in smaller villages and in the field around Pokrovsk,” he said.
    


            However, that changed once Russia began encircling Pokrovsk over the summer.
    


            Frequent drone and artillery attacks on the key highway and rail line have forced Kyiv to find alternative supply routes, shifting the hub function away from Pokrovsk – a major success for the Russians. The city also hosted Ukraine's last operating coking coal mine, but it was forced to shut down early this year.
    


            “From this point further, it doesn't actually operationally do anything for the Russians, because they already achieved the main effect that they needed to a while ago,” Barros told CNN.
    


            Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier this week that Russia had amassed some 170,000 troops in the region to bolster the Pokrovsk offensive.
    


            It is clear that, while Pokrovsk has been mostly ruined and its strategic value has all but disappeared, it has become a symbol. And in a war that has largely stalled, symbols like this matter.
    


            Pokrovsk would be the largest city Russia has seized since Bakhmut in May 2023. While some 60,000 lived in Pokrovsk before the war, the majority have left since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to Ukrainian authorities, some 1,200 civilians remain in the city.
    


            Some of those left have missed the window of opportunity to flee – Ukrainian authorities have said evacuations are currently impossible – but others might be waiting for the Russian troops to arrive. The Russian Ministry of Defense has already shared a video it said showed evacuations of Pokrovsk residents to the Russian side.
    


            “Strategically, from the political and informational perspective, Pokrovsk is very important, because Vladimir Putin has gone out of his way numerous times to make public national and international statements about the seizure,” Barros said.
    


            “He is conducting a strategic information campaign which seeks to present Russia's military victory on the battlefield as inevitable,” he added.
    


            Putin has made it clear his goal is to take over of the whole of Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as well as Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south.
    


            Taking over Pokrovsk would allow Russia to shift its focus elsewhere – namely towards the string of industrial cities to its northeast that form the backbone of Ukrainian defenses in the region.
    


            One soldier from Ukraine's 129th Brigade who is currently deployed near Kostyantynivka told CNN the expectation on the ground is that “as soon as the Russians deal with Pokrovsk and (the neighboring town of) Myrnohrad, the pressure on Kostyantynivka will increase and they will move towards Druzhkivka.”
    


            He said his battalion doesn't have the number of soldiers it should have and is running low on armored vehicles.
    


            The soldier said that the main concern of troops in the area is that the Ukrainian leadership will try to hold onto what remains of Pokrovsk for as long as possible because abandoning the city would be seen as a major failure.
    


            “There has been no order to withdraw although everyone already understands that the fall of Pokrovsk is inevitable. Pokrovsk was held for a very long time, a very long time. But the forces were exhausted, and reinforcements were not sent in time,” he said.
    


            He said withdrawal will become much more dangerous the longer the Ukrainians hesitate, repeating previous painful experiences for Kyiv's forces.  The battles of Bakhmut in 2023 and Avdiivka in 2024 were both marked by delayed withdrawals, which led to high casualty rates among Ukrainian personnel.
    


            “We will have to squeeze through the bottleneck, and you surely understand the high level of losses that such an exit from the encirclement will entail,” he said.

LONDON, November 8. /TASS/. The European Union plans to create a specialized center "for democratic resilience" in order to "counter disinformation" allegedly coming from Russia, China, and other countries, the Guardian said, citing a leaked EU document.

The newspaper specified that the document, initiated by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, is slated to be published on November 12.

According to the Guardian, the "European Commission intends for the center to bring together expertise across the EU and from countries seeking to join the bloc to fight foreign information manipulation and interference."

The newspaper insists that the European Commission sees the biggest threat in purported Russia's "hybrid attacks, waging a battle of influence against Europe," naming China as another source of a "disinformation threat."

"The center would be a hub for EU institutions and member states to share information and early warnings, as well as raising public awareness about foreign governments seeking to manipulate information," the Guardian noted.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Read the latest news on Russia's overnight Nov. 8 attacks, including its drone strike on a residential building in Dnipro.

Kyiv and Kyiv Oblast faced emergency power outages after a new large-scale Russian attack overnight on Nov. 8, which targeted Ukraine's energy and gas infrastructure.

Ukrainian forces downed 406 out of the 458 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Russia also launched 45 cruise and ballistic missiles, nine of which were downed, the statement said.

The cities of Kremenchuk in Poltava Oblast, Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv served as the primary target of Russian attacks. Explosions were also heard in the city of Sumy, as well as in Odesa Oblast.

"Very brazen, in many ways the strike is demonstrative," President Volodymyr Zelensky said, adding that Ukraine is working with the U.S. to buy additional Patriot air defense systems. 

Emergency power cuts were introduced in several Ukrainian regions due to the attack, according to Ukraine's state grid operator Ukrenergo.

Ukraine's largest private energy company, DTEK, reported on Nov. 8 that one of its thermal power plants had been "seriously damaged" by a Russian attack. According to the company, Russia has attacked DTEK power plants over 210 times since the start of the full-scale invasion.

In Kyiv, outages varied by location, with some areas expected to remain without electricity for up to eight hours.

Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk said that the consequences of the attacks are being determined and normal outages (up to four hours a day) will be restored "once the situation in the energy system stabilizes."

In Kyiv, explosions were heard just before 4:30 a.m. local time, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground. Officials reported that air defense were at work in the city amid a wider Russian drone attack on the capital.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko later reported that a fire has been reported in the Pechersky district amid falling drone debris stemming from the attack. The fire was later extinguished, the mayor added.

No casualties in the capital were reported. 

The attack on Kyiv comes amid a wider attack on cities closer to Ukraine's front line regions. Air raid alerts throughout the night warned of Russian ballistic missile attacks, targeting Ukraine's central, southern, and eastern regions.

Ukraine's State Emergency Service reported energy infrastructure was struck in Odesa Oblast amid the ballistic missile attack.

Throughout the fall, Russia has intensified attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure as it attempts to plunge the country into yet another harsh winter. The worst strikes on Oct. 3 and 5 wiped out around 60% of Ukraine's gas production sites.

Earlier in the night, Russia also carried out a drone attack on a residential building in the city of Dnipro, injuring at least seven people, including two children, officials reported.

The Kizlyar Electromechanical Plant produces equipment for Russian Sukhoi and MiG aircraft and has been sanctioned for its role in the war against Ukraine. 

Russia launched yet another wide-ranging attack on Ukrainian cities overnight on Nov. 8, using a combination of drone and missiles to strike targets across the country.

The recent Russian attack destroyed all restored capacity, leaving the plants generating no power, the state-owned energy company Centrenergo said on Nov. 8.





 As winter approaches and Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy system intensify, a small unit from the 3rd Army Corps spends sleepless nights hunting long-range Shahed drones on the front line in Kharkiv Oblast — before they reach Ukrainian cities.

The Russian strike killed 12 servicemen and seven civilians, while 36 others were injured, according to the Prosecutor General's Office. 

Russia carried out a drone attack on the city of Dnipro overnight on Nov. 8, killing at least three people and injuring 12 others, including two children, officials reported.

Ukrainian forces downed 406 out of the 458 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Russia also launched 45 cruise and ballistic missiles, nine of which were downed, the statement said. 

The number includes 1,190 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

"We have received a full sanctions exemption for the Turk Stream and Druzhba pipelines," Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said. Reuters reported that the exemption was granted for one year.



"He was the head of a large system, and this system was supposed to ensure the security of our energy sector. He was obliged to do this — and he did not," the president told journalists on Nov. 7.

WASHINGTON, November 8. /TASS/. Control over the ceasefire regime in the Gaza Strip has shifted from the Israeli leadership to the US-established coordination center, the Washington Post (WP) reported, citing sources.

"The US military-led ‘coordination center' charged with implementing President Donald Trump's peace plan in the Gaza Strip is replacing Israel as the overseer of humanitarian aid to the enclave, even as multiple people familiar with the center's first weeks of operations have described it as chaotic and indecisive," the newspaper said.

"In a transition that was completed Friday, the Israelis are still ‘part of the conversation,' but decisions will be taken by the wider body," a US official told the newspaper.

More than 40 countries and organizations are represented in the US-led center, and "one of the benefits […] of bringing them all together is that enables you to really sort through fact from fiction and get a clearer understanding of what is happening on the ground, where the needs lie," Tim Hawkins, US Central Command spokesman, told the Washington Post.

Israel and the Gaza-based Hamas Palestinian movement resumed Egypt-, Qatar-, United States-, and Turkey-mediated indirect talks on settling the situation in the Gaza Strip on October 6. On October 9, the parties to the conflict signed an agreement on the implementation of phase one of US President Donald Trump's Gaza ceasefire plan. The ceasefire came into effect on October 10.

On October 28, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered to deliver powerful strikes on the Gaza Strip after armed militants from the Hamas movement violated the ceasefire by delivering strikes on the Israeli military in the Rafah area in the southern Gaza Strip. Hamas denies its involvement in the Rafah incident.

According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, 104 people were killed in Israeli strikes while 253 sustained wounds.

             Employing the casual hyperbole of his presidential idol, the “Chinese Trump” gave our interview a 67 out of 10.
    


            He said it calmly. Cheerfully. With absolute confidence. Like people do when they're standing in a megacity with fans seemingly on every street corner.
    


            Here in Chongqing, southwestern China, population 32 million, business manager Ryan Chen has mastered an impression so uncanny that strangers stop eating lunch to look up, mid-bite, when they hear his voice.
    


            As we moved through the crowded, fog-rimmed October streets, the same day as Trump's long-anticipated summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, Chen's fame became apparent.
    


            Fans mobbed him like a Hollywood star. Another phone was thrust into his orbit. Another group photo. Another, “Can you do the voice?”
    


            And then comes his Trump schtick.
    

CNN's Mike Valerio travels to the Chinese metropolis of Chongqing where Ryan Chen, a 42-year-old business manager turned viral Trump impersonator, takes him on a tour of the city and talks about how he hopes to use his newfound internet stardom to bridge cultural divides.


            Chen pairs his pitch-perfect Trump impression with a Trump-style salesmanship of the best of China.
    


            Delectable hotpot in Chongqing? “The best, the finest.” Glittering skylines that make his hometown look like Hong Kong on steroids? “Totally incredible.”
    


            “Ask me how do I feel today? I'll tell you. I feel fantastic,” Chen declared, with that mix of bombast and deadpan that's both satire and sincerity.
    


            Chen mimics Trump's voice with eerie precision, but it's a talent that's only been in the public sphere since January – and all because Chen lost a bet.
    


            “I went into a truth and dare with my friend, and I lost,” he told me. “And (my friend) dared me to do Trump, and put it on my account, see how it goes.”
    


            The video went viral.
    


            For millions across China, especially those who watch the US from a fascinated digital distance, Chen became a one-man portal into the American presidency, without the clunky geopolitical baggage.
    


            Chen is now one of China's most popular English-language creators, with more than two million followers combined on Instagram and Douyin, China's version of TikTok.
    


            He understands the American media feed better than many who grew up inside it – a startling achievement for a man who's never been to the United States.
    


            And he uses his Trump impression to promote his hometown of Chongqing – and China – as a tourist destination. But on China's closely monitored social-media platforms, his videos walk a tightrope.
    


            “I try to keep everything non-political,” he said. “I'm promoting my culture, my food, showing basically what's real about China.”
    


            Which is how I found myself joining Chen for a day, experiencing a meticulously curated Trumpian sales pitch of Chongqing.
    


            We ate lunch inside a packed restaurant with red-checkered tablecloths and a dozen tables. Steam blasted out of the kitchen like the cooks were trying to season the air. Chen ordered all the courses.
    


            Tofu pudding with piping-hot dipping sauce. Pork with Sichuan seasoning. And the chef's signature: braised pork belly with fermented cabbage at the bottom.
    


            “This one's my regular go-to… When you put it in your mouth it just melts,” Chen said.
    


            “So incredible, only in Chongqing,” he added, hands moving like he's playing an invisible accordion.
    


            Then came the thousand-year egg. “It tastes like MSG,” Chen offered. And when diners nearby half-turned their heads to check if the foreigner liked it, Chen saw my expression of delight. In his Trump voice, he declared, “I love this guy! He likes everything! He likes every controversial food!”
    


            Outside, skyscrapers broke through the fog like theatrical scenery. More fans. More phones. And then, a visit to Chen's barber, Mr. Tom.
    


            This is the man who tends to Chen's all-important hair. “He's very professional, this guy,” roared the Trump voice.
    


            Chen sat. The shears hummed. He coached the cut like a director choreographing his own silhouette.
    


            “I'm gonna look 30 pounds lighter after this. We had a promise, right? A deal is a deal, right?”
    


            Cut. Dust. Brush. Reveal.
    


            “Tremendous,” Chen said, as he examined his reflection.
    


            Mr. Tom echoed, on command: “Tremendous!”
    


            Chen says he enjoys what he does because laughter bridges barriers, even between superpowers. His fans say the same thing – that he shows them a China that feels confident, funny, and cosmopolitan.
    


            And as someone who arrived in China only weeks ago, I found myself unexpectedly enlightened by a Trump impersonator in a part of the country that's not typically high on tourist itineraries.
    


            Chen's broad appeal with audiences in the US and China shows that language is no barrier when it comes to sharing a laugh.
    


            As for what's next? He's slowly winding down his day job in an architecture firm and would like to pursue acting full-time.
    


            There's also his dream – audacious, perhaps cinematic – of visiting America for the first time.
    


            More to the point, he'd like to dive into New York, the city that gave us Trump.
    


            “I'd like to experience, embrace the chaos a little bit to see how it really feels,” Chen said.
    


            Yes, Chen's voice is astonishing. Yes, the viral fame is ascendant.
    


            But by dusk in Chongqing, it hit me that the loudest thing Chen wants from his imitation is perhaps also the simplest: joy.

Former President Joe Biden told a Nebraska audience that the Democratic Party is "back" after sweeping election wins and accused President Donald Trump of trampling on the Constitution and cutting healthcare funding.

Former President Joe Biden told Nebraska Democrats on Friday that their party "is back" after a series of sweeping election wins last week and also accused President Donald Trump of destroying the Constitution and cutting health care and food assistance for millions of Americans.

Biden, 82, speaking at the Nebraska Democratic Party's "Ben Nelson Gala" in Omaha, also urged Republicans to end the ongoing government shutdown and said his late son, Beau Biden, should have been president, not himself.

"The Democratic Party is back. That's not hyperbole," Biden said. "Did you see the election results?"

Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J. and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., won gubernatorial races in their respective states, while Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani scored a stunning victory to become New York City's next mayor. The wins came a year after former Vice President Kamala Harris suffered a stinging defeat to Trump. 

Harris was propelled to the top of the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket after Biden backed out of the race following a blistering debate performance against Trump. 

"Well, the American people are sending a message, a message to Trump and to his crowd," Biden said, accusing the president of trampling on democracy and working for the rich.

"I just want you to know you work for us, Mr. President. We don't work for you," Biden said. "You work for us, not just billionaires and millionaires. You know, this is democracy. And the fact of the matter is that there are no kings in democracies. None. None. But you act in a way that embarrasses the nation."

Biden said Trump and the GOP were cutting health care programs and driving up costs, adding that more than 300 rural hospitals in America, including two in Nebraska, are expected to shut down.

BIDEN PRAISES LATE-NIGHT HOSTS SPEAKING OUT AGAINST TRUMP 'KNOWING THEIR CAREERS ARE ON THE LINE'

"Folks, I've never said this my whole career. I think it's immoral. It's un-American. It's flat-out wrong," Biden said.

Biden, who had a bandage on his head, referred to his own battle with cancer and praised the health care workers who have been treating him. He was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer earlier this year.

"I know what cancer research means. Cancer. It's every family. It hit my family hard, just as so many of yours," Biden said. "When the love of my life, my oldest son, the attorney general of the state of Delaware, who should have been the president, not me, volunteered to go to Iraq for a year, didn't have to, came back with stage four glioblastoma because he lived in a burn pit just like those guys did on 9/11, and he died."

Biden also took aim at Trump's plans to build a new ballroom at the White House after bulldozing the East Wing, calling it "the perfect symbol of his presidency."

"When I left the presidency, President Trump was going to take a wrecking ball to the country, but I had no idea it would be an actual wrecking ball," Biden said. "Anyone see what he's done to the East Wing of the people's house? Trump has taken a wrecking ball not only to the people's house, but to the Constitution, to the rule of law, to our very democracy."

He also accused Trump of "deliberately making hunger worse" and claimed "one in five children go to bed hungry every night."

He mocked Trump for holding a "Great Gatsby" themed Halloween party at Mar-a-Lago while cutting food aid for millions, saying it showed "who he is."

"On Friday, everyone dressed up like the rich folks they are from the Roaring Twenties and on Saturday he cut assistance to 40 million Americans," Biden said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.

Minneapolis Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey spoke in Somali during his election victory speech. (Credit: Yusuf Shire/Raad Media via Storyful)

Newly re-elected Minneapolis Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey is facing backlash from conservatives for giving a victory speech in Somali and saying that Minneapolis welcomes Somalians.

In a video of the speech posted online, Frey can be seen leading chants in Somali as the crowd responds and applauds.

Popular conservative influencer Paul Szypula ripped into the progressive mayor, writing, "The pandering here is insane."

"Mayor Jacob Frey, as he won reelection, spoke almost a minute in Somalia then said Minneapolis belongs to Somalia," said Szypula.

In a second round of nonpartisan ranked-choice voting, Frey narrowly defeated a challenge from socialist Minneapolis state Sen. Omar Fateh. Fateh is the first Somali American and first Muslim to serve in the state senate.

Fateh had the backing of the Twin Cities' chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America and "Squad" member Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who represents Minneapolis in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Meanwhile, Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., who was former Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate last year and is up for re-election next year, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., endorsed Frey's campaign this year.

While speaking with a crowd of Somali residents after his victory, Frey repeatedly thanked the crowd in Somali.

"To the great people of Minneapolis, and I say that very intentionally, because no matter where you are from, Minneapolis should be a place where you are proud to call home," he said.

He then proceeded to list off a number of Somalian regions, saying, "Whether you are from Bosaso or Mogadishu, whether you are from Hargeisa or Garowe, whether you are from Beledweyne or southwest, Minneapolis is a place where you come to seek prosperity, where you come to raise your family."

"Here is what this election means, this election means this is a moment for unity, where the entire Somali community can come together and say, ‘This is our people, this is our city, we are united behind each other," he said.

Conservative pundit Gerry Callahan slammed Frey's speech, saying, "This is an American politician, raised in America, educated in America, ostensibly representing Americans, prostrating himself in front of bunch of foreigners. Could be the most humiliating thing I've ever seen." 

Podcaster Matt Walsh also chimed in, writing, "As I have said many times now, politicians in this country should be required by law to speak English when addressing the public in an official capacity. There should never be a time when Americans can't understand what their elected leaders are saying."

Nick Sortor wrote, "I don't know how large ICE's presence in Minneapolis is, but it needs to be much, MUCH larger." 

Fox News Digital reached out to Frey's team for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.

This is not the first time Frey has garnered criticism over Somali-language political messaging. He was also widely criticized in September for releasing a campaign ad in Somali. 

Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, commented on the ad, saying, "This must be stopped." 

Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., also reacted to the ad, posting a disapproving gif. 

Kari Lake simply wrote, "WTAF?" which is an acronym for "what the actual f---."

Having entered office in 2018, Frey was elected to his third term as Minneapolis mayor on Tuesday. He is best known for marching with protesters during the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots, which were particularly destructive in Minneapolis, the city in which George Floyd died. Frey was also seen kneeling and weeping by Floyd's casket at a memorial service.

Country star John Rich of the music duo "Big & Rich" spoke with Fox News Digital about his endorsement of Jody Barrett in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District.

FIRST ON FOX: A Tennessee Democratic state representative running for Congress, who has been likened to Zohran Mamdani, claims she is running to make life better for the working class, but her voting record tells a different story. 

Tennessee state Rep. Aftyn Behn, D-District 51, who is running to replace outgoing Congressman from Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, Mark Green, voted no last year on a bill that would have resulted in a $400 million tax cut for certain Tennessee small businesses, including potential refunds of up to $1.5 billion. Behn also rallied against Republican's H.R. 1, the so-called "one, big beautiful bill," which extended Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts that, without, could've meant a nearly $4,000 increase for taxpayers in her district. 

Meanwhile, earlier this year, Behn voted against a statewide budget bill that would have added tens-of-millions to the state's rainy day fund, which would have effectively padded the state's coffers so that in times of low-revenue taxes won't need to be increased so much. That same budget bill would have also allocated millions for volunteer fire departments, senior centers, emergency medical services, teacher bonuses and other public safety funding.

"A pissed-off social worker, Aftyn has seen firsthand how broken systems fail the very people they're meant to protect," Behn's campaign website reads. "She's now running for Congress after the so-called ‘Big, Beautiful Bill' passed — a giveaway to the wealthy that codified the largest transfer of wealth from working people to the rich in American history."

However, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation, if Trump's 2017 tax cuts had expired, residents in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, whom Behn wants to represent, would have seen an increase in their taxes of approximately $3,717 per taxpayer.

"To win, Democrats need to focus on what really matters: making life more affordable for working people," Behn said after the bill's passage. "Washington Republicans did the opposite by passing this #BigBullsh--Bill. Gutting healthcare and giving handouts to billionaires."

TENNESSEE SUED OVER LIMITED ACCESS TO EXECUTIONS AS MEDIA DEMAND TRANSPARENCY 

Even the New York Times has admitted that independent analyses showed Trump's 2017 tax cuts "have consistently found that a large majority of Americans would owe less because of the law."

Last year, Behn also voted against a bill that the Tennessee General Assembly Fiscal Review Committee estimated would provide over $1.5 billion in tax refunds for small business owners in the state. It also would have reduced a combined yearly tax burden for Tennessee business owners of about $400 million. 

Simultaneously, Behn voted against Tennessee's 2025-2026 fiscal year budget that included a big increase to the state's rainy day fund, which is used by state governments during periods of low revenue. The same budget bill also included community funding for services like volunteer fire departments, emergency medical services and rescue squads, senior centers, teacher bonuses, school security and more. 

During Behn's time in the state legislature, she also worked to repeal the grocery tax in Tennessee, claiming it would put money back into the pockets of hard-working Tennesseans year-around. However, according to Republicans, the move would create a business enterprise tax, raising taxes on small businesses by about $800 million.

Fox News Digital reached out repeatedly to Behn's campaign for comment but did not hear back. 

"Aftyn Behn's policies would skyrocket the cost of living even more for hardworking Tennesseans," Behn's Republican opponent, Trump-backed Matt Van Epps, said. "Aftyn has repeatedly voted against tax cuts and proposed new taxes, taking more money from your pocket. I'll always fight to lower taxes and bring down costs so that working families can get ahead."  

In local media reports, Behn has been compared to New York City mayor-elect and self-proclaimed socialist Zohran Mamdani and the Dickson County Democratic Party described Behn as "our very own AOC of TN," in a reference to U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

"His message is one of helping working families across New York, my message is one of helping working families across Tennessee," Behn said about Mamdani during the appearance on CNN. "We need to go back to pocketbook issues, especially in states like Tennessee where people are living unaffordable lives and suffering as a result of Republican policies."

            Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision not to seek reelection next year could open the floodgates on the race to replace her.
    


            Pelosi, who has served in Congress since 1987, already had two primary challengers ahead of her Thursday announcement: Saikat Chakrabarti, a former chief of staff to US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic California state Sen. Scott Wiener.
    


            Chakrabarti launched his bid to unseat Pelosi earlier this year as part of a wave of younger Democratic challengers who argued the party needed candidates with new ideas to reshape it in the wake of Republicans' 2024 electoral wins.
    


            Wiener, who has represented much of the city in the state Senate since 2016, previously said he wouldn't challenge the former House Speaker. But he argued that it was necessary to get in against Chakrabarti, a self-funder who made his millions in the tech industry.
    


            “I never wanted to run against Nancy Pelosi. I have enormous respect for her – I think she walks on water,” Wiener said in an interview. “But there are limits to how long you can wait. At some point, you need to get into the race and start making the case to the voters.”
    


            Other candidates are expected to announce their own bids. San Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan has been floated as a potential candidate and former San Francisco Mayor London Breed told Politico Friday she is considering running.
    


            Already, the field of prospective and declared candidates has sparked discussions about what kind of leader the district should elect to represent a rare, solidly blue open seat. Pelosi won re-election to the San Francisco seat in 2024 with 81% of the vote.
    


            “We're really seeking authentic and courageous leadership for working families across the country, and San Francisco deserves no less,” Jane Kim, the California director for the Working Families Party, told CNN. “It is a generational chance for a bold new voice in Congress for the city by the bay, and we look forward to a robust endorsement process.”
    


            Here's how the field is shaping up so far:
    


            Chakrabarti launched his campaign to unseat Pelosi in February, arguing that while he respected what she had accomplished during her career, the Democratic Party needed new leaders who could meet the current moment. He helped kick off a wave of young challengers who argued the party needs to be completely overhauled.
    


            He praised Pelosi for deciding not to seek reelection.
    


            “I think it's a continuation of her leadership, to actually step down from power,” he said in an interview. “It's a very rare act of leadership in Washington, DC.”
    


            A software engineer by trade, Chakrabarti made his fortune as a founding engineer at the payment platform Stripe. He went on to work on independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, helped found Justice Democrats, a progressive group that backs primary challenges against centrist Democratic incumbents, and managed Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 congressional campaign. As her chief of staff, he helped author the Green New Deal, the left's sweeping climate policy legislation.
    


            Chakrabarti has pointed to that resume as proof of his progressive bona fides after facing criticism from some San Francisco progressives, particularly over his endorsement of a more centrist Board of Supervisors candidate who ousted a Democratic Socialists of America-backed incumbent last year. He said he's been attacked from both the left and the right over the course of the campaign.
    


            “In San Francisco, I guess I'm in the center somewhere, and I hope that means the majority of the city is with me,” he said.
    


            Wiener has focused on housing policy and LGBTQ rights during his nearly 10 years in the state Senate. He's also set up a robust fundraising operation – his campaign announced that it had raised more than $730,000 on the day he launched his bid last month, before Pelosi announced her plans to retire.
    


            Wiener said the presence of a self-funder like Chakrabarti in the race, and a looming filing deadline, spurred him to jump in.
    


            Dan Newman, a San Francisco-based Democratic strategist, said that his decision to jump in early was “risky” but proved to be smart.
    


            “People understood that he couldn't wait forever,” he said.
    


            California's congressional filing period doesn't begin until early next year, at which point several Democrats and few Republicans could enter the race.
    


            Chan, who was first elected as a supervisor in 2020 and views Pelosi as a mentor, could garner support from progressives and labor leaders. Pelosi has not endorsed in the race, but political observers have noted the former Speaker and Chan worked together to pass Democrats' redistricting push, Proposition 50.
    


            “This moment is about thanking Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi for her legendary public service, and honoring her and her family for their extraordinary commitment to San Francisco and to bettering our entire country,” Chan said in a statement.
    


            The latest congressional hopeful to signal interest was Breed. The former mayor led the city from 2018 until 2025, after losing her re-election bid to incumbent Mayor Daniel Lurie.
    


            “It's important that San Franciscans have options,” Breed told Politico. “I want to explore whether I could potentially be one of those options.”
    


            Another open question is whether Pelosi's daughter, lawyer Christine Pelosi, will enter the race. Newman said that, for years, conventional wisdom held that the younger Pelosi would pursue the seat when her mother retired. That certainty has faded, he said.
    


            Whoever Pelosi eventually backs would become a frontrunner.
    


            “If Nancy picked somebody off the street, then that gives them a little bit of instant credibility,” Newman said.

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., joins Fox & Friends Weekend to discuss the impact of the ongoing government shutdown. 

President Donald Trump has urged Senate Republicans to abolish Obamacare and reroute federal health care spending directly to individual Americans.

In a Truth Social post Saturday morning, Trump wrote: "I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over."

"In other words, take from the BIG, BAD Insurance Companies, give it to the people, and terminate, per Dollar spent, the worst Healthcare anywhere in the World, ObamaCare."

The post marks Trump's latest push to revive his long-running campaign against the Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, a centerpiece of former President Barack Obama's domestic legacy. 

PEOPLE TALK ABOUT LOWERING HEALTHCARE COSTS, BUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS DOING IT

Trump and Republicans have renewed their criticism of the program amid the government shutdown, arguing it drives up costs and enriches insurance companies at taxpayers' expense. Trump spent much of his first term trying to repeal the law.

Obama and Democrats argue it made health care more available and affordable for millions of Americans.

Congress remains deadlocked over government funding, with health-care programs and insurer subsidies among the major budget sticking points fueling the shutdown.

House Speaker Mike Johnson on Thursday told reporters Thursday that he would not commit to holding a vote on extending COVID-19 pandemic-era enhanced Obamacare subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of this year without congressional action.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., had been floating a vote on such an extension in exchange for Democrats voting to end the shutdown.

The issue of enhanced Obamacare subsidies has been a matter of debate within the GOP, with some Republicans in more moderate districts calling for at least a year-long extension to give lawmakers time to create a new healthcare deal in its place.

Trump also once again called on Republicans to end the filibuster, the procedural rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation.

"Unrelated, we must still terminate the Filibuster!" Trump wrote.

One week after national outlets reported that the Justice Department had opened a fraud investigation into the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, the organization announced Friday that it had severed ties with longtime strategist and board member Shalomyah Bowers, citing a “leadership transition.”

The move sharpened scrutiny of the organization's finances and governance just as federal authorities examine whether tens of millions of dollars raised in 2020 were misused, according to legal experts and nonprofit researchers who have tracked the organization's scandals.

In a Nov. 7 letter to supporters, BLMGNF said Bowers's “time on the board has come to an end” and that his consulting firm's work with the group had ceased. The message framed the shake-up as part of a renewed commitment to “transparency, integrity, and faithful stewardship.”

The announcement followed reports from the Associated Press and CBS News that the Justice Department is investigating whether donations to the national BLM entity were diverted by its leadership after the 2020 racial-justice protests. The investigation, reportedly led out of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, focuses on possible donor fraud. No charges have been filed, and the foundation says it is not a target of the investigation.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California declined to comment.

Federal scrutiny comes amid years of controversy surrounding the foundation's finances. In 2022, Sean Campbell reported in New York Magazine that BLMGNF used nearly $6 million of donated funds to purchase a 6,500-square-foot Los Angeles property through an LLC connected to the law firm Perkins Coie.

The house was initially described as a creative hub, but records showed it had also been used for private events and personal filming projects. Nonprofit group experts said the arrangement blurred boundaries between charitable and private benefit, raising questions about oversight and disclosure.

That same year, the foundation's first public Form 990 showed it had received roughly $77 million in donations during the height of the 2020 protests and ended the fiscal year with $42 million in assets. The filing also disclosed payments of more than $2.1 million to a consulting firm run by Bowers, nearly $970,000 to a company founded by the father of co-founder Patrisse Cullors's child, and more than $840,000 to a security firm operated by her brother. Experts said the transactions, while not necessarily illegal, illustrated weak internal controls and potential conflicts of interest for an organization of such size and prominence.

BLMGNF's governance structure also drew criticism. During the 2020–2021 fiscal year, Cullors served as the foundation's sole voting board member, and its filings listed only two employees. Nonprofit attorneys called that lack of independent oversight a major red flag for the IRS. Cullors stepped down as executive director in 2021, later admitting she had stayed at the Los Angeles property for several days and hosted two private parties there. She reimbursed the foundation $390 for one event and later conceded that using the house for personal gatherings “probably wasn't the best idea.”

The separation with Bowers marks another turning point. 

His firm's multimillion-dollar contracts were among the most scrutinized in the foundation's 990 filings. In 2022, a separate entity known as Black Lives Matter Grassroots sued Bowers and the foundation in Los Angeles County Superior Court, accusing him of diverting about $10 million in donations for personal use and turning the nonprofit into a “personal piggy bank.” Bowers denied any wrongdoing, and in June 2023, a judge dismissed the case under California's anti-SLAPP statute, finding the plaintiffs lacked standing and failed to substantiate their claims. 

Parker Thayer, an investigative researcher at the Capital Research Center, told the Washington Examiner that Bowers's ouster should be viewed as a warning sign.

“It's a massive red flag,” he said. “It's something we haven't seen at any nonprofit in America in recent history. That's like a five-alarm fire.”

Thayer added that the Justice Department has been increasingly aggressive in policing nonprofit abuses and said BLMGNF's issues are so extensive that “there aren't too many things that a nonprofit could do wrong that BLM hasn't already done.” He said the group's repeated controversies around financial disclosures and leadership self-dealing create “a strong likelihood that an investigation will find something that actually goes the distance.”

Thayer also pointed to BLMGNF founder Cullors's previous admission that she found preparing IRS filings “triggering,” and argued that her reaction betrayed an awareness of deeper problems. “You don't get scared by paperwork unless it reflects reality,” he said. “I think there is a good chance that something more than clerical errors is found.”

Legal analysts say that any criminal investigation would likely hinge on patterns of wire fraud, tax violations, or false filings with the charity. 

John Shu, a constitutional lawyer who served in both Bush administrations, told the Washington Examiner the Justice Department would almost certainly begin by examining “whether they filled out the correct tax forms and whether they lied on them.” 

He added that prosecutors would also look at possible conspiracy and fundraising-fraud angles. “Was there a conspiracy among two or more of the leaders to misappropriate funds and to lie on their tax forms?” Shu said. “And did they mislead donors about how their money would be used?”

Shu said the inquiry could also test how far the department is willing to stretch its resources to pursue a case. 

“It's not clear to me that it would stay just in California,” he said. “Because of the scale of the foundation and the national network of donations, this could easily be run out of Main Justice rather than a local U.S. attorney's office.”

He also suggested the statute-of-limitations clock could still allow prosecutors to act. “People were still donating into 2021, so those transactions are well within the window,” Shu said, noting that a standard five-year federal limit would likely govern probable wire-fraud or tax-related charges. “The first thing they have to do is get a grand jury together, because only the grand jury can issue subpoenas — not only for testimony, but for documents, hard drives, and emails.”

BLMGNF has insisted it is not a target of the investigation. The group plans to expand its board, tighten conflict-of-interest policies, and conduct an external audit as part of broader transparency reforms. Cullors and other former leaders have described the controversy as exaggerated and politically motivated.

DOJ INVESTIGATING ALLEGATIONS BLACK LIVES MATTER DEFRAUDED DONORS

BLMGNF did not respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner.

While it remains unclear whether the Justice Department will ultimately pursue a civil lawsuit or consider criminal charges, the reported investigation into one of the country's most visible civil-rights organizations has reopened questions about accountability, transparency, and public trust in the movement's finances, and whether the government will ultimately test those questions in court.

Students at NYU, Baruch College, Columbia and Barnard College sat down with Fox News Digital and revealed the truth about how professors promote biased beliefs on campus.

EXCLUSIVE: A number of students revealed the "extremist" viewpoints held by some university professors that "play a role" in fostering an antisemitic environment on campus, condoning anti-Israel protests and maintaining a bias message that is "not exactly something that should be promoted" at their respective schools.

Jewish students from NYU, Columbia, Barnard College and Baruch College sat down with Fox News Digital during an exclusive interview and exposed the "disturbing things" that have been said by professors at some of the top schools in New York City and in the U.S.

"I've had many peers share very disturbing things that professors have said in class, whether it's in courses specifically related to Middle Eastern politics or in classes that should be completely absolved of anything happening in the Middle East," TJ Katz of Columbia explained.

"We've had professors yell at students, not support students," Mera Skoblo of NYU told Fox.

"Just the presence of these professors on campus, you know, a lot of them on their offices have signs saying things like, hands off our students, and they have free Palestine signs on their doorways," Eliana Birman of Barnard explained.

"I had professors that were antisemitic," Aidan Herlinger of Baruch told Fox. "I know students that have had professors that are antisemitic, we are put in positions where we can't do anything about it, because it could cost us our grade."

"We need to extricate extremists from the classroom, do departmental audits," Shoshana Aufzien of Barnard added.

PROMINENT UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR SAYS ANTI-ISRAEL CAMPUS PROTESTS ‘WERE ENCOURAGED FROM IRAN'

Columbia University has been one of the most notorious campuses that has faced anti-Israel riots and demonstrations. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, hundreds of students and non-students have been arrested as a result of riots.

NYU faced similar, though less intense, protests on its NYC campus, including a Dec. 12, 2024, demonstration outside the university's library where protesters called for an "intifada revolution" saying that "Tel Aviv is stolen land."

Skoblo outlined her fears as a Jewish student on campus, saying that "a lot of us are scared."

"The past two years on college campuses across New York City have been difficult for Jewish students," Skoblo told Fox. "Some of us hide our identities. We've been screamed at. We've been blocked out of our own library during finals week."

"How are we supposed to study when we hear chanting that shouts towards our destruction, makes us feel unsafe and unheard," Skoblo added.

When asked if faculty influenced or pressured students to adopt a specific stance in the Middle Eastern conflict, Aiden Herlinger from Baruch College said, "I think the professors definitely play a role."

While the students explained that antisemitism has existed on college campuses for some time, students noted that the recent rise in tensions and anti-Israel rhetoric that came after Oct. 7, 2023, could be attributable to professors indoctrinating or influencing students to participate in demonstrations, some of which turned violent and led to expulsions, suspensions and arrests.

As for the consequences these professors may face for being accused by their own students of indoctrinating, Herlinger said there will likely be none.

"[Professors are] not going to face any consequences, especially in a school like Baruch that's a public school, and it's funded by the New York State government, and New York City government," Herlinger added.

"These are just professors that are not going to face consequences."

If you have upcoming travel plans anytime soon, you might notice fewer options on the airport's departure board. 

Airlines are scaling back flights at dozens of major U.S. airports to ease the pressure on air traffic controllers, who have been working unpaid and under intense strain during the ongoing government shutdown.

The Federal Aviation Administration says the decision is necessary to keep travelers safe. Many controllers have been putting in long hours and mandatory overtime while lawmakers are at a standstill over how to reopen the government.

Major hubs like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago are among those affected, and the ripple effects could mean more cancellations, longer delays and fuller flights for travelers across the country. The cutbacks will impact hundreds if not thousands of flights daily.

Here's what to know about the FAA's order — and what you can do if your plans are disrupted:

There's a good chance it is. The list spans more than two dozen states.

It includes the country's busiest airport — Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia — and the main airports in Boston, Denver, Honolulu, Las Vegas, Miami, San Francisco and Salt Lake City.

Multiple airports will be impacted in some metropolitan hubs, including New York, Houston, Chicago and Washington.




It's hard to say. Even if the shutdown ends soon, the FAA has said it would not lift the flight restrictions until staffing at airport towers and regional air traffic centers makes it safe to do so. 

“It's going to take time to work through this,” said Michael Johnson, president of Ensemble Travel, an association of travel agencies in the U.S. and Canada.

That's why, he said, it's important to plan ahead — whether you've already booked flights or you're just starting to make holiday travel plans.

Airlines say they will let their customers know if their flight is called off.

Still, it doesn't hurt to check your airline's app or a flight-tracking site for updates before you leave for the airport. It's better to be stuck at home or in a hotel than stranded in a terminal.

“Take a deep breath. Don't panic,” Johnson said. “There are options available. They may not be ideal, and they may be inconvenient, but you have options.”

If you're already at the airport, it's time to get in line to speak to a customer service representative. While you're waiting, you can call or go online to connect to the airline's reservations staff. It can also help to reach out on the social platform X because airlines might respond quickly there.

Now might also be the time to consider if it makes sense to travel by train, car or bus instead.

Kyle Potter, executive editor of Thrifty Traveler, said the shutdown is different from when a single airline is having problems and travelers can just pick another carrier.

“The longer the shutdown drags on, it's unlikely that there will be one airline running on time if the rest of the them are failing,” Potter said.

The airlines will be required to issue full refunds, according to the FAA. However, they aren't required to cover extra costs like meals or hotel stays — unless the delay or cancellation was within their control, according to the Department of Transportation.

You can also check the DOT website to see what your airline promises for refunds or other costs if your flight is disrupted.

Not necessarily. You might just need a little more planning and flexibility than usual. 

A travel adviser can help take some stress off your plate, and travel insurance may give you an extra safety net.

Johnson also warned that flights could sell out fast once the shutdown ends.

“There will be a flurry of booking activity,” he said. “So try to get ahead of it and make sure that you're protected.”

Booking an early flight can also help, says Tyler Hosford, security director at risk mitigation company International SOS. If it gets canceled, you still “have the whole day” to sort things out.

Travel light. Limiting baggage to a carry-on means one less airport line to deal with, and if your plans change unexpectedly, you'll already have everything with you.

Give yourself extra time at the airport, especially if you're an anxious flyer or traveling with young children or anyone who needs extra help getting around.

And be nice. Airline agents are likely helping other frustrated travelers, too, and yelling won't make them more willing to help. Remember, the cancellations aren't their fault.

“An extra ounce of kindness to yourself and to others at this time of year, with all of the disruptions, will go a long way,” Johnson said.

Rep. Thomas Massie — a Republican fiscal hawk facing a President Donald Trump-backed primary challenger in Kentucky — has previously described himself as "America First," but now he says he thinks that he's "America only." 

"I am tired of sending money overseas," he told Fox News Digital during an interview on Thursday. 

"I am tired of favoring foreign beef over U.S.A.-grown beef," he continued. "I'm ready to be America only. And I think all congressmen should be that way."

Massie gave Trump a mixed review, saying that the president is America First on "some" fronts.

"But when it comes to the beef, he is not America first. When it comes to sending money overseas to Ukraine and Israel," Massie said, "I think he needs to get back to his campaign promises and put America first. Because we're not gonna make America great again by sending our money overseas."

Massie noted that his "biggest disagreement" with both the Trump administration and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is the increase in spending.

"I mean, I thought we were conservatives. Why are we spending more this year than Joe Biden spent in his last year? Actually, we're spending about $200 billion dollars more," he said, adding that the consequence "is inflation and higher interest rates."

"And people are feeling that. You can't gaslight them," Massie added. "You can't tell them that things are getting cheaper when they're not getting cheaper."

In a statement to Fox News Digital, White House spokesman Kush Desai accused Massie of "Fake Math."

"Here are the facts: President Trump's Working Families Tax Cut Act cut mandatory spending by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, and the budget deficit from April to September of this year is down a staggering 40% compared to last year, when Joe Biden was president," Desai declared in the statement.

"Instead of Fake Math, Thomas Massie should reflect on how he betrayed his voters and hardworking Americans when he voted with every Democrat against the biggest tax cut for working families in American history, including no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime pay, increased child tax credits, and permanence for the 2017 Trump Tax Cuts," he added.

Massie said his other disagreements with what has been happening in D.C. are "secondary" to the spending issue.

"I would say, we need to follow through on some of our campaign promises. For instance, release the Epstein files," he said.

Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have been spearheading a bid to force a House vote on a proposal that would compel the release of materials pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein. 

Their discharge petition has amassed 217 of the 218 signatures needed to force the vote, but Democratic Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, who has said she will sign on, has still not yet been sworn in to office more than six weeks after winning a special election in Arizona.

Johnson "has tried every which way he can to avoid this vote," Massie claimed, asserting that the speaker has not sworn in the Democrat because she "represents the 218th signature I need to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files."

Fox News Digital reached out to Johnson's office for comment.

RAND PAUL PLEDGES SUPPORT FOR MASSIE AGAINST TRUMP-BACKED CHALLENGER: ‘I'M GOING TO HELP HIM'

Massie, who owns cattle himself, said the president has "sort of gut punched the cattle ranchers and… livestock farmers" in the U.S.

During remarks aboard Air Force One last month, Trump indicated the U.S. was considering buying beef from Argentina to drive down prices. 

Days later Reuters reported that a White House official indicated that the administration was quadrupling the nation's low-tariff imports of beef from the South American nation. Increasing the tariff rate quota to 80,000 metric tons will allow Argentina to send greater quantities of the product to America at a lower rate of duty, according to the outlet.

The president has Massie in his political crosshairs — he has repeatedly reviled the congressman on Truth Social.

In a post on Monday, Trump referred to Massie as "a Weak and Pathetic RINO" — a pejorative acronymn that stands for "Republican in name only." He also called the congressman "a totally ineffective LOSER," while expressing his support for primary challenger Ed Gallrein, who Trump is backing in the race.

Even as the president tries to convince voters in Kentucky's 4th Congressional District to reject Massie, the lawmaker said that he does not regret endorsing Trump ahead of the 2024 election, noting that former Vice President Kamala Harris would have been a total "disaster."

Massie initially backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential primary, but DeSantis dropped out and backed Trump, and Massie later endorsed the Republican juggernaut as well.

"And I'm glad that President Trump won," he said. 

Trump has "done a lot of good things," he said, adding that many of them have been carried out via executive order, and he thinks Congress should vote on more of the issues so that the president's moves are not simply "temporary actions."

Asked whether he'd have any interest in potentially running for president himself, Massie said that he is not interested.

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — More than 69,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war so far, Gaza health officials said Saturday, as both sides completed the latest exchange of bodies under the terms of the tenuous ceasefire.

The latest jump in deaths occurred as more bodies are recovered from the rubble in the devastated Gaza Strip since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10, and as previously unidentified bodies are identified. The toll also includes Palestinians killed by strikes since the truce took hold, which Israel says target remaining militants.

Israel on Saturday returned the remains of another 15 Palestinians to Gaza, according to hospital officials in the territory, a day after militants returned the remains of a hostage to Israel. He was identified as Lior Rudaeff, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's office. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said that Rudaeff was born in Argentina.

The exchanges are the central part of the ceasefire's initial phase, which requires that Hamas return all hostage remains as quickly as possible. For each Israeli hostage returned, Israel has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians.

The truce is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the Palestinian militant group. It began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage.

Also Saturday, Israeli settlers staged two attacks on Palestinian farmers, paramedics, activists and journalists in the occupied West Bank as settler violence reaches new highs in the territory.




Palestinians on Saturday checked the newly returned remains. Ahmed Dheir, director of forensic medicine at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, said that the remains of 300 people have now been returned, with 89 identified.

“We do not have sufficient resources or the DNA to match them with the martyrs' families,” Dheir said. Unidentified ones will be buried in batches.

Hopeful families looked into the body bags of decomposed remains. “Close it, it's not him,” one family said.

“I always come here. I have not lost hope. I am still waiting for him,” said the mother of a missing boy, who did not give her name.

Gaza's Health Ministry said the number of people killed there since the war began has risen to 69,169. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.

The ministry said 284 people were added to the total after their identities were verified between Oct. 31 and Nov. 7.

And over the past three days, 10 bodies were brought to Gaza hospitals — nine retrieved from under the rubble and one newly killed, the ministry said. Since the ceasefire began, 241 people have been killed in Gaza, it said.

It added that a large number of Palestinians remain missing.

Israel's military on Saturday said that soldiers killed two militants who had approached troops, one in northern Gaza and the other in the south.

Palestinian health officials said 11 people were injured in an attack by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, including journalists, medics, international activists and farmers, as settler violence reaches new highs during this year's olive harvest.

The U.N. humanitarian office has reported more Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians and their property in the West Bank in October than in any other month since the office began keeping track in 2006. There were more than 260 attacks, or an average of eight incidents per day, the office said.

Activists and medics have flocked to this year's olive harvest to help Palestinian farmers safely reach their fields.

A video circulating in Palestinian media showed the inside of a West Bank hospital where the injured — bandaged and bloody — were brought from Saturday's attack on the town of Beita.

Jonathan Pollak, a longtime activist, told The Associated Press that he was picking olives when dozens of masked Israeli settlers, armed with clubs, descended, chasing them and lobbing rocks.

Pollak said he saw five settlers converge on a journalist and her security guard. He watched the settlers beat and bludgeon her, denting her helmet. Pollak was hit in the head with a rock and taken to the hospital.

“It's a pattern we see every day,” Pollak said. “This is just one finger in the iron fist of Israeli policy aiming to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from their land.”

There was no immediate Israeli comment.

Rights groups say that arrests for settler violence are rare, and prosecutions even rarer. Israel's left-leaning Haaretz newspaper reported in 2022 that based on statistics from the Israeli police, charges were pressed in only 3.8% of cases of settler violence, with most cases opened and closed without action being taken.

Also Saturday, Palestinian paramedics reported another settler attack in a nearby village, Burin. The Palestinian Red Crescent said settlers injured four international activists and one 57-year-old man.

Israel's military said soldiers responded to a report of rock-throwing at an Israeli vehicle and that Israeli civilians then hurled rocks at harvesters. It said Israeli and Palestinian civilians were injured.

Acting I.C.E. Director Todd Lyons discusses President Donald Trump's deportation efforts on 'America Reports.'

Three illegal immigrants in Louisiana allegedly ran a sex trafficking ring and offered a "menu" of women to potential clients as young as 18 using WhatsApp, federal prosecutors allege.

Officials said Zaira Lopez-Oliva, Kirsis Castellanos-Kirington and Jesus Lopez, known as "El Perro," were arrested in October after running a sex trafficking ring in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

A source initially tipped off the FBI with screenshots from WhatsApp from El Perro, who sent pictures of scantily clad women who were available for sex acts, according to court documents. Prosecutors allege that the women were forced to have sex with men, who paid anywhere from $40 to $60.

Both Castellanos-Kirington and Lopez-Oliva allegedly helped Lopez with several aspects of the sex trafficking operation.

Prosecutors said Lopez-Oliva helped Lopez transport victims to and from the New Orleans Airport. In one surveillance video screenshot shared by the Department of Justice, prosecutors said Lopez-Oliva was seen inside a pickup truck with Lopez near the New Orleans Airport.

Castellanos-Kirington and Lopez-Oliva both helped Lopez "maintain the operation" at the two locations in Baton Rouge when he was unable to, the documents state.

The complaint detailed that clients of the sex trafficking ring were anywhere from 18 to 60 years old.

When federal agents raided the house where the operation was based, one of the victims said she was in financial trouble and got Lopez's contact information from a friend, prosecutors said. She was allegedly informed when she arrived in Louisiana that she'd be performing sex acts for male clients. Two of the victims interviewed were also illegal immigrants.

The female victim allegedly told prosecutors that she wouldn't be paid at all on Mondays and Tuesdays, and would only get to keep $20 if a client paid $40, with the rest going to Lopez.

One of the victims also told investigators that she "was not allowed to leave or tell anyone what she was doing," and if she told anyone, Lopez would "kill her."

All three suspects are charged with sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion as well as aiding and abetting.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Watch CNN Original Series “Tony Shalhoub Breaking Bread” for a mouthwatering journey around the world, with bread serving as the conduit into a variety of cuisines and cultures. The series airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on CNN.



            When the baguette received official UNESCO heritage status in Paris in 2022, the French delegation waved slender loaves of crusty bread triumphantly in the air, in a photo op that went viral around the world.
    


            French president Emmanuel Macron hailed the baguette as “250 grams of magic and perfection in our daily lives” on social media, accompanied by an iconic vintage black-and-white Willy Ronis photo of a jubilant little French boy captured mid-run with a long baguette tucked under his tiny arm.
    


            But the UNESCO victory, which saw the artisanal know-how of French breadmaking and the culture of the baguette inscribed in its intangible cultural heritage list, appears to have done little to reverse the ongoing decline of bread consumption in France, generating headlines like, “Will bread disappear from French tables?” in French food media.
    


            Historically, the French ate an average of 25 ounces of bread per person, per day in the years following World War II. According to the Federation of Bakery Entrepreneurs, by 2015 that number plummeted to 4 ounces. Today, that figure has dropped again to 3.5 ounces, equal to a little less than half a baguette a day.
    


            In a 2023 consumer survey released by the National Confederation of French Bakeries and Pastry Shops (CNBPF), more than a third (36%) of the 1,000 respondents also said they had reduced their bread consumption over the last five years.
    


            Industry experts say it's a trend driven by changing eating habits, along with a new generation of “neobakers,” some of whom are opting to take baguettes off their shelves entirely, and the growing popularity of the baguette's American rival, processed sliced white bread.
    


            “One of the threats is the fact that young people are losing the habit of buying a baguette every day,” says Dominique Anract, president of the CNBPF.
    


            Daily baguette runs to the local bakery – an errand that Anract says used to be as automatic and ritualistic as brushing teeth – have become less frequent.
    


            But this is especially true of younger generations, who are cooking less and eating out more.
    


            “In the past, even students cooked for themselves. There was no snacking, no ‘world food,' no burgers, kebabs or sushi. But more and more young people are turning towards fast food,” he says.
    


50 of the world's best breads



            Traditionally, baguettes are eaten as open-faced tartines at breakfast, slathered with butter and jam, or chocolate hazelnut spread. At lunch, they're stuffed with ham, tuna, chicken or cheese for a take-out baguette sandwich. And at dinner, they're the indispensable accompaniment to a traditional saucy French meal like a blanquette de veau (veal stew) or beef bourguignon, in which hunks of bread are used to mop up any remaining sauce on the plate – a gesture that has its own verb, called “saucer.”
    


            “We see that these young people are very happy to have the traditional baguette on weekends when they visit their parents, so it is appreciated. But life has become more modern and there are different options for eating out without bread,” Anract says.
    


            In recent years, there's been another noteworthy shift that is changing France's relationship to bread: the rise of “neoboulangeries” or neo-bakeries. This new generation is baking with ancient grains and organic flour, selling aromatic, long-fermented sourdough loaves and making fewer baguettes – if any at all.
    


Seize Heures Trente Pâtisserie-Boulangerie in Rennes is one of several bakeries across France that have made headlines this year for having the audacity not to sell baguettes.
    


            When pastry chef and owner Marion Juhel expanded her pastry shop into a bakery two years ago, she made the deliberate decision not to offer baguettes. For Juhel, it's an energy-intensive product with little nutritional value, and has a short shelf life which leads to one of her biggest pet peeves: excessive food waste.
    


            Instead, large sourdough breads and whole grain loaves made with local, organic flour are sold by weight. Along with staying fresher for longer, the breads, which weigh up to 7 pounds, feed more households, are better for digestion thanks to longer fermentation times that break down gluten, and just taste better, she added.
    


            But for some, the idea of a baguette-free French bakery was hard to swallow. Juhel recalls one man who flew into a rage when he was told they didn't make any. She had to ask him to leave.
    


            “There was a real need to educate customers so that they understood our approach,” Juhel told CNN. “It's true that French people expect a bakery to have baguettes. And the fact that we proclaimed to be a bakery and didn't have them was inconceivable to them.”
    


            Another entrepreneur who shares Juhel's ethos is artisan pâtissier and boulanger Benoît Castel, who has been described as one of the pioneers of the modern bread movement when he made rustic sourdough loaves his signature product in 2012.
    


            Instead of baguettes, it's his caramelized, aromatic pain du coin – a play on words that means both local bread and quince bread, after the fruit-based sourdough starter the bread is made from – that is the big seller at his three Paris bakeries.
    


            “Right from the start I wanted to make these large loaves, which are more traditional, like they used to be made in the past,” Castel says.
    


            Because as Castel notes, baguettes only emerged in the 20th century as an alternative to traditional loaves that were made once a week. Unlike the time and labor-intensive pains de garde (which translates as “bread that keeps”), baguettes with their shorter baking times became popular among the Parisian bourgeoisie, who quickly developed a taste for fresh-baked white bread every day.
    


            But while pains de garde can be eaten all week long, baguettes go stale quickly, leading to significant waste in French households.
    


            To redress this at his own bakery, Castel created his pain d'hier et de demain (the bread of yesterday and tomorrow), made from stale, unsold inventory. Apart from a deeper, toastier-colored crumb, the zero-waste bread tastes virtually indistinguishable from freshly-baked loaves.
    


            For Castel, the popularity of gut-friendly, organic sourdoughs and zero-waste bakeries is a reflection of an exciting time: while the French may be eating less bread, they're eating better, he says.
    


            “I think we've never eaten such good bread as we are right now. We eat very good bread today in Paris.”
    


            But baker Éric Kayser, who built a mini empire of 370 bakeries around the world on the strength of his signature tradition baguette made with liquid sourdough starter, makes an interesting point about specialty breads that are taking the capital by storm.
    


            “The problem is that that bread is much more expensive. It's not affordable for everyone,” he says.
    


            For context, a simple baguette, which can be made with additives and baked from frozen, is around a euro. The upper-tier artisan tradition baguette — which by law can only be made fresh with flour, water, salt and leavening, be it yeast, sourdough starter, or a combination of both — is about €1.30. By contrast, a 500-gram chunk of specialty bread, which is often sold by weight, can sell for up to €7.
    


            “The purpose of a baguette is to feed a lot of people. Those are more elitist bakeries. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's just that it corresponds to a certain type of middle-class customer,” Kayser says.
    


            Despite declining bread consumption, Kayser says he has no worries about its demise. Even when the results of another consumer poll by the Federation of Bakery Entrepreneurs found that 86% of French people admit to eating industrial, sliced white supermarket bread.
    


            “Some older people like it because it's easier on the teeth, and then there are young people who buy a loaf of bread, put it in the fridge where it will keep for a whole week and live a bit like Americans. It's practical,” Anract acknowledges.
    


            Still, Kayser scoffs at the idea that the baguette is in any real danger.
    


            “Never in a million years. People love it.”
    


            Kayser points out that the baguette sandwich, which is a relatively recent product that only started taking off in late '90s and early aughts, has picked up where single baguette sales have dropped off.
    


            In fact, Kayser is so confident in his star product that last year he opened a concept store and “baguette bar” simply called baguett. in Paris with co-founder Deborah Magnan. Along with three-foot-long sandwiches, loaves of fuschia-pink baguettes dyed with beets and studded with cranberries, or surprisingly green pistachio and white chocolate loaves are displayed in shop windows.
    


            “It's a simple idea, but our French customers say, ‘Why has no one ever done this before?'” Magnan says.
    


            For Anract, neobakeries and creative bakers like Muhel, Castel and Kayser are what have always propelled France's breadmaking culture forward.
    


            “We have to adapt. Bakeries have always gone through crises but we've always reinvented ourselves.”

            This week in travel: a secret garden is a secret no longer in Beijing, one of France's classic pastries is the subject of a surprising debate, and why some couples are ditching each other at the airport.
    


            He likes arriving four hours early for a domestic flight and then chilling in the lounge. She prefers to have a pre-flight cocktail and browse the duty free options. What's a couple to do? Welcome to “the airport divorce.”
    


            British travel journalist Huw Oliver coined the phrase to explain how he and his fiancee go through airport security together, split up for different airport activities (having a beer, trying out perfumes, obsessively watching the departures screen), and then reunite on board the plane.
    


            Some people might just call this “compromising,” but Oliver says the airport divorce has done wonders for his relationship — and it sets the tone for a happy vacation.
    


            Many travelers love being able to say they're among the first to go somewhere. Now, visitors to Beijing's Forbidden City complex can access Qianlong, a secret garden that has been closed for a century.
    


            Timed for the 100th anniversary of the Palace Museum's opening, the Chinese attraction features rockeries, symbolic figurines believed to ward off fire and destruction, and a discreet entrance that gives you a sense of what it felt like to be the Emperor sneaking into his personal green space.
    


            2025 has been a surprisingly big year for opening up formerly secret places, both above and under ground.
    


            The Comodus Tunnel, a secret passageway used by Roman emperors to access the Colosseum, just opened to the public this fall.
    


            And in London, a mile-long tunnel complex used during World War II is being converted into an underground attraction, which will house a museum, an arts center, and — best of all — the world's lowest licensed bar. CNN got an exclusive look inside.
    


            A Japanese hotel group has launched a program to accommodate guests' plus-ones. No, they don't mean babies. Or pets. They're talking about stuffed toys of your favorite characters.
    


            The Toyoko Inn chain has launched a “Sleepover With Your Plushie” program in 56 hotels across Japan, saying it wants to capitalize on the social media fad of taking plush toys and dolls (that means you, Labubu) and posting photos of them on vacation.
    


            “We noticed that some guests were using the bedside area like a stage, arranging their plushies and other “oshi” (fan) items to take creative photos,” a rep for Toyoko said in a statement.
    


            Under this program, plushies will get beds, PJs, pillows and comforters, all made of the same materials as the human versions — and it only costs an extra $2 per night. This really gives “plush hotel” a whole new meaning.
    


            Yes, it looks like a pain au chocolat, but don't call it that in Bordeaux or you may find yourself in a shouting match.
    


            Most of France calls the beloved pastry pain au chocolat, but in the Bordeaux region they call it a chocolatine. Meanwhile, you'll need to order a “couque au chocolat” in the Ardennes, a “petit pain au chocolat” in Hauts-de-France, and – possible sacrilege? – a “croissant au chocolat” in Grand Est.

Air traffic controllers say the Federal Aviation Administration's plan to trim flight schedules by up to 10% during the government shutdown doesn't go nearly far enough to ease the crushing workload inside the nation's control centers, and may do little to address what they describe as a growing safety risk.

The Washington Examiner spoke with three current air traffic controllers and one who recently left the agency. None were authorized to speak publicly, and all requested anonymity out of concern for retaliation. They described a system buckling under chronic staffing shortages, six-day workweeks, and mandatory overtime, now pushed to the brink as controllers report for duty without pay.

The FAA has ordered airlines to scale back flights by up to 10% at 40 of the nation's busiest airports over the next week, a phased reduction that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said was meant to “alleviate building risk” as controllers continue working without pay.

A controller at a major center in the Midwest said that the shutdown has only magnified problems that were already eroding morale and compromising focus.

“Ten percent of flights being canceled throughout the day isn't going to impact us whatsoever,” he said. “The problem isn't the number of flights on paper, it's the number of qualified people in the room.”

He said the FAA's decision to scale back flights is “performative,” arguing that it does little to relieve workload or fatigue inside the facilities where controllers are already stretched to their limits. “We're still working the same amount of traffic with fewer people,” he said. 

Asked whether it remains safe to fly, he paused. 

“Yes, it's still safe,” he said. “Is it as safe as it was a month ago? Unequivocally, no.”

He explained, “Our baseline leading into the shutdown was not healthy.” The system, he said, was already stretched thin after months of mandatory overtime, uneven hiring, and years of pay stagnation that had left morale at an all-time low. Controllers, he added, were still dealing with the fallout from January's midair collision near Reagan National Airport, when staffing shortages and outdated technology were thrust into the spotlight. 

‘WE JUST MAKE IT WORK': STRAINED AIR TRAFFIC CULTURE AT REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT EXPOSED BY NTSB CRASH INQUIRY

After 10 years in the job, he described a schedule that leaves little room to rest. Six-day workweeks are routine from March through November, with most controllers rotating through a “rattler” schedule: two evening shifts, two early morning shifts, and an overnight. When staffing is low, the sixth day is often added on top, forcing them to come in on what should be a rest day, sometimes for any shift the facility needs covered.“It's just not sustainable,” he said. “You finish one shift, go home, maybe see your kids for an hour, try to sleep, and then turn around for a midnight shift.”

When staffing dips, the pressure mounts. “Instead of working an hour and getting a 30-minute break, we're working two or three hours and getting maybe 20 minutes off,” he said. “You can't stay 100% working 20 to 25 aircraft at a time for hours straight and expect to maintain safety.”

That exhaustion, he said, is driving absences as controllers run out of patience and money. “Some people are calling in sick because they're literally going out to drive Uber or pick up side work,” he said. “Others are just burned out. You can only lean on patriotism for so long before reality hits; people have bills to pay.”

Each callout forces others to take on extra shifts. He has logged about 400 hours of overtime this year, which is now typical across many facilities. He said he's fortunate to have savings and a zero-percent credit-union loan while paychecks are frozen. “Even if you're OK financially, it's demoralizing to get a pay stub that shows zeros when you're working overtime,” he said. “For the newer folks, it's not just frustrating, it's survival.”

According to the controller, many newer hires earn between $50,000 and $60,000 per year and have been required to relocate for training or assignments, often to high-cost areas far from home. He said missing even one paycheck can mean missing rent or car payments.

“They absolutely can't afford it,” he said. “This is all anybody talks about. It's taking focus away from the mission.”

FAA data show the number of fully certified controllers has declined over the past decade, even as air traffic volumes have climbed. “It feels like an entire generation is going to spend their careers working short-staffed,” he said. 

Controllers in other regions echoed that frustration, saying the flight reductions may sound significant  but make little difference in practice.

A controller in the Dallas-Fort Worth area called the cuts “a media stunt to make it look like the problem is being fixed, when it's not.” He said even with a 10% reduction, the change barely touches the daily workload for controllers managing some of the nation's busiest airspace.

“A 10% reduction in arrival rates won't make any real difference,” he said. “At most major airports, we already operate below maximum capacity. Taking Dallas-Fort Worth from 130 arrivals an hour to 117, or Charlotte from 87 to 78, doesn't change much.”

He explained that major hubs operate on banked schedules that already run at their maximum limits, meaning the reductions won't ease staffing pressures or prevent delays. “Every day we're dealing with flow programs and reroutes to cover for low-staffed areas, while working with skeleton crews,” he said.

In Minnesota, a controller who recently quit said the shutdown was “the final push” after months of burnout and frustration over pay and staffing. He had spent nearly six years in air traffic control, first in the military, then in the federal system, before walking away just two weeks ago.

“I quit and served my last day of notice,” he said. “It wasn't just because of the shutdown, but that was the tipping point.”

He said the agency was already struggling to keep new hires even before paychecks stopped. “Trainees show up under enormous stress,” he said. “They've moved across the country, they're learning one of the hardest jobs in the world, and now they don't know how they'll pay their bills.”

The shutdown, he said, pushed many over the edge. “We started seeing more people calling out, taking sick leave, or just giving up,” he said. “A lot of controllers are talking about quitting; some like me already have.”

He said his own decision to leave came from exhaustion and disillusionment. “This job is already stressful,” he said. “Add low staffing, no pay, and leadership that doesn't seem to care, and it becomes unbearable.”

He warned that the longer the shutdown lasts, the harder it will be for the FAA to recover. “If this keeps up, new hires won't stick around,” he said. “They're already behind on staffing, and this just makes it worse.”

Federal officials say the flight reductions are a necessary and proactive measure to protect the integrity of the airspace while thousands of controllers continue working without pay.

Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford outlined the order this week, describing it as a “temporary, data-driven step” to “maintain the highest standards of safety in the national airspace system.” 

The plan will reduce flight operations by 4% starting Friday, gradually increasing to 10% by Nov. 14 across 40 of the nation's busiest airports, including Atlanta, Chicago O'Hare, Los Angeles, New York LaGuardia, and Reagan National Airport in Washington. At least 1,000 flights were canceled nationwide on Friday, according to FlightAware. Duffy warned Friday that the percentage could jump to 20% unless the government shutdown ended.

A U.S. Department of Transportation spokesperson told the Washington Examiner the decision was guided entirely by safety metrics, not politics.

“This was a data-driven decision made by non-political safety experts at the FAA who based their decision on the strain our system is currently seeing,” the spokesperson said. “Unprecedented times call for unprecedented actions. We'll continue to assess the data and adapt as needed.”

Rep. Rick Larsen (D-WA), the top Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said the FAA's plan to reduce flights by 10% at 40 airports beginning Nov. 7 is “a dramatic and unprecedented step that demands more transparency.” He added, “The FAA must immediately share any safety risk assessment and related data that this decision is predicated on with Congress.”

The agency said the reductions were informed by safety data and confidential reports from both pilots and air traffic controllers, which showed growing fatigue and strain within the system. “We are seeing signs of stress in the system, so we are proactively reducing the number of flights to make sure the American people continue to fly safely,” Bedford said.

During a visit to Reagan National Airport on Friday, Duffy said recent data revealed “a troubling trend,” pointing to an increase in runway incursions, pilot complaints, and instances where aircraft came too close together in flight.

“That data is going in the wrong direction, not in the right direction, which made us make the decision to take additional measures to reduce the pressure in our system,” Duffy said.

The shutdown comes just months after Duffy unveiled his signature plan to “supercharge” the air traffic control workforce and overhaul the FAA's aging infrastructure. In February, he announced a streamlined hiring process and a 30% increase in starting salaries for academy graduates at the FAA's training center in Oklahoma City, a move he said would begin reversing more than a decade of workforce decline.

Since then, the agency has reported record recruitment figures, surpassing its fiscal 2025 goal by hiring just over 2,000 new controllers. Still, training those recruits can take years, and the total number of fully certified controllers remains lower than it was a decade ago. “We're 3,000 controllers short, and we've been 3,000 short for over a decade,” Duffy said earlier this year.

The push followed months of scrutiny over safety lapses and near-misses, including the January midair collision near Reagan National Airport that killed 67 people. That disaster prompted the FAA to accelerate modernization projects, including replacing hundreds of radar systems, upgrading software across control centers, and building six new towers, a multibillion-dollar plan Duffy says could be completed in as little as four years if Congress provides funding.

Many controllers fear that even when the shutdown ends, the damage will linger. While federal officials insist the system remains safe, the controllers responsible for keeping it that way say the strain is showing.

 “I mean, this absolutely introduces more risk into the system, without a doubt,” said a controller based in Philadelphia.

The controller described an industry held together by human endurance more than institutional support, one that depends on overtime, unpaid labor, and the quiet resolve of those who still show up.

“We're expected to keep the skies moving no matter what,” the controller said. “But you can only patch so many holes before something slips through.”

Senate Democrats voted against a House of Representatives-passed continuing resolution that would fund the federal government through Nov. 21 for the 15th time on Friday, stretching the shutdown to a record 39 days.

Without congressional authorization to spend money, the Trump administration has been forced to cut spending on many programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as food stamps.

Last week, a federal judge ordered the Agriculture Department to at least make partial SNAP payments to recipients, equal to the size of available funds left in an emergency fund designed to cover SNAP payments. But now the judge is back, demanding that the administration make full November SNAP payments, even though there is no lawful appropriation or dedicated fund to do so.

“It's an absurd ruling because you have a federal judge effectively telling us what we have to do in the midst of a Democrat government shutdown,” Vice President JD Vance said in response to a question about the ruling. “We can't have a federal court telling the president how he has to triage the situation. We're trying to keep as much turned on. We're trying to keep as much going as possible. The president and the entire administration are working on that, but we're not going to do it under the orders of a federal judge.”

There are about 42 million people receiving $8 billion a month in food stamp benefits. The Agriculture Department maintains a contingency fund to help keep food stamp payments stable, but there is only $4.65 billion in that fund, not enough to pay everyone's full benefits.

After a federal district judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to pay out at least partial benefits until the fund was exhausted, the Agriculture Department complied, releasing to each state its share of the SNAP funds. But SNAP is a federally funded program administered by the states, and the states are having administrative trouble getting those partial payments out the door. Implementing major modifications to a safety net spending program in the middle of a government shutdown is not as easy as some federal judges think it is.

Faced with delays caused by partial payment, the same judge is now ordering the Agriculture Department to tap a totally different fund to issue full payments for November. But that fund, the Section 32 Child Nutrition Programs Fund, was designed primarily to be a backup fund for the school lunch program, not food stamps. The Section 32 fund has also been used to bail out farmers with direct payments, including by President Bill Clinton to compensate hog farmers in 1998 and by President Donald Trump in 2018 to compensate soy bean farmers caught up in his first-term trade war.

It is one thing for a federal judge to order the executive branch to pay benefits by emptying an emergency fund created specifically to fund that program, but it is an entirely different matter to start siphoning dollars from a federal fund designed to support one program to bail out a completely different federal program. That is not how the Constitution works.

The chaos caused by the Democratic Party is going to grow as the shutdown drags on. Already, hundreds of flights have been canceled across the country because there are too few air traffic controllers to operate them safely. Section 8 housing rents are not being paid to landlords, and hospitals are not receiving Medicaid payments.

DEMOCRATS' OFF-YEAR WINS REMIND US WHY THE FILIBUSTER IS NEEDED

None of this pain was necessary, and all of it can be ended immediately if Senate Democrats simply vote with Republicans to pass the continuing resolution and open the government.

Democrats say they care about protecting poor people, but they are the ones keeping the government closed. The Constitution gives Congress, not courts, the power to appropriate money. If Democrats want to ensure that 42 million people receive their full food stamp benefits, they can do so today by voting to reopen the government. Every day they refuse to act, they deepen the suffering of low-income families, jeopardize essential programs, and invite judicial overreach. It's time for Democrats to stop the gamesmanship, restore lawful governance, and let the people who depend on these programs get the help Washington promised them.

            The impacts of the longest federal government shutdown in United States history are reverberating around the country — leaving millions of Americans in limbo and igniting concerns about an economic downturn.
    


            Frustrated travelers were scrambling as more than a thousand flights were canceled Friday and thousands more were delayed. Those who count on food stamps were in limbo as President Donald Trump's administration continued fighting in federal court to resist paying full benefits for November. Federal workers who haven't been paid in weeks said their bills were due and they were running out of options.
    


            With Congress in a stalemate — majority Republicans still short of the 60 votes they need to pass a government funding measure in the Senate, and minority Democrats sticking to their health insurance funding demands — no end to the shutdown is in sight.
    


Is the federal government shutdown affecting you? Tell us about it



            Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Friday that the “wheels came off” in compromise talks with Democrats. He told senators to remain in Washington and available for votes this weekend. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would agree to end the shutdown in exchange for one more year of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies — an attempt to further pressure the GOP to make a deal.
    


            The uncertainty over when the shutdown might end has led to deepening concerns about damage it could do to the overall economy — with one of Trump's top economic officials sounding the alarm on Friday. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Fox Business that the economic impact of the shutdown is “far worse” than initially expected “because it's gone on for so long.”
    


            “If we go another month or so, then who knows how bad the economy could be this quarter,” he said.
    


            A 4% reduction in domestic flights ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration took effect Friday, leading to more than a thousand canceled flights across 40 major airports — with further cuts slated for the weekend due to air traffic controller staffing issues.
    


            In addition to the cancellations, major airports — including those in Washington, Atlanta, San Francisco and Newark — were experiencing major delays due to short-staffed control towers.
    


            Travelers across the country told CNN they feared their plans being upended.
    


            Alicia Leva was set to get married Saturday in South Florida. But with more than half of her guests attending from across the country, Leva said she saw travel plans unraveling fast.
    


            “When I found out about the flight delays, I was just incredibly anxious,” she said. Leva didn't want to compare her wedding woes to others who have been deeply affected by the government shutdown, but was still mourning her original vision of the couple's special day.
    


            Traveler Jay Curley had hoped to fly to Wilmington, North Carolina, from Newark International Airport on Thursday night, but was instead going to rent a car, he told CNN in frustration Friday morning.
    


            “People are really hurting out here,” he said. Addressing federal lawmakers, he added: “It's not just the traveling public, but it's affecting the whole economy, and you people are to blame.”
    


            When Luana Griffin's mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer this past week, she booked a flight to go spend a few days with her. Griffin's trip, from San Diego to Sacramento, is planned for next week, she told CNN. Griffin said she has limited windows of time to be able to see her mom because she is working a contract job. Any delay or cancellation of her return flight could cause her to miss work the next day, she said.
    


            “I have very limited time left with my mom and so many other decisions, this is the last thing I need,” she told CNN in an email.
    


            A federal judge on Thursday ruled that the Trump administration needed to fully pay Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for more than 40 million Americans this month, rather than the partial payments the administration had proposed.
    


            “The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened and needless suffering will occur. That's what irreparable harm here means. Last weekend, SNAP benefits lapsed for the first time in our nation's history. This is a problem that could have and should have been avoided,” US District Judge John McConnell said during Thursday's hearing in Rhode Island.
    


            The US Department of Agriculture then announced Friday it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal court order, and that the process should be completed later in the day. Several states quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in the coming days.
    


            But later Friday, the Supreme Court temporarily paused the lower court order requiring full payment of benefits, injecting more uncertainty into whether food stamp recipients would see their full allotments anytime soon.
    


            Zacherie Martin, 35, of Bremerton, Washington, said he and his girlfriend are out of work and rely on food stamps in part because they can never predict whether local food banks will have food available.
    


            He said he's been following news about the government shutdown “very closely,” and is struggling to plan, given the uncertainty around whether and what amount of SNAP benefits he'll receive.
    


            “I'm worried if I'm going to even be able to eat at all before Thanksgiving — or at all tomorrow night, or tonight, even,” Martin said.
    

Onita Norris is trying to figure out a problem that has no good answer. She keeps running the numbers to see how much money she has to feed her two children, both under five, and how much she'll have to go without. CNN's Rene Marsh reports.


            Laura Bowles, a pregnant mother of five children, ages 4 to 13, in West Virginia, is trying to make her husband's paycheck from Walmart stretch to feed their family and pay the bills this month. She told CNN earlier this week that her growing family has already made some tough choices this month after their SNAP benefits didn't replenish on the first.
    


            “My kids eat a lot. And groceries are already so expensive these days. It was already hard,” Bowles said. “It's a struggle out here. I am pregnant again, and that wasn't part of the plan — but it was God's plan. I guess people struggle everywhere, but it's hard here in West Virginia. It just feels extra hard here. And this just made things go from bad to worse. Way worse.”
    


            Cuts or delays in SNAP benefits could also hurt the stores that sell to its recipients — particularly smaller grocers.
    


            SNAP accounted for $124 billion in sales at 262,000 retailers in 2023 — half of which were at superstores such as Walmart. A quarter of sales went to supermarkets.
    


            Large chains such as Walmart, Kroger, and Dollar General can absorb cuts to SNAP. It's the small, independent grocers that depend on SNAP for up to half of their sales to sustain razor-thin profit margins that are most vulnerable to cuts, economists and grocers say.
    


            Progressive think tank Center for American Progress in May identified 27,000 retailers — mostly in rural areas with large shares of SNAP recipients — likeliest to shoulder the brunt of cuts to SNAP. In dozens of small counties and tribal areas, more than 30% or 40% of the population receives SNAP benefits.
    


            Though many of them have remained on the job, most federal workers haven't been paid during the shutdown. Some of them told CNN that bills are now piling up.
    


            Lisa Morales, a nurse who works at a military base in El Paso, Texas, said she was able to make rent for October and November, but can't go any further without pay. She said she's not sure how she's going to afford her car and insurance payments, gas, groceries, dog food and utilities this month without a paycheck. She said her landlord won't work with her, and she doesn't know where she'll live if the shutdown doesn't end soon.
    


            “We are not eligible for unemployment, because we are still reporting to work, so that disqualifies us for benefits,” she said. “I will have to look for another job this month if the government continues to be shutdown.”
    


            At a recent job fair in McLean, Virginia, hosted by RockITGov, furloughed federal workers offered sobering accounts of what they face. They asked not to be named in order to speak candidly.
    


            “I haven't gotten a paycheck. I'm trying to find a way to support my family. I have a young family,” one federal worker said. “We're trying to figure out next steps, what our finances look like.”
    


            A nine-year Pentagon employee who took the deferred resignation offer in May said she was supposed to be paid through December, but hasn't received a paycheck since early October because of the shutdown. She said she's planning to skip holiday travel and gift-giving.
    


            “I'm concerned about my car payments. I'll probably call the bank and see if I can skip a car payment,” she said. “I may have to take money from my retirement if my savings run out.”

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — UPS and FedEx said they are grounding their fleets of McDonnell Douglas MD-11 planes “out of an abundance of caution” following a deadly crash at the UPS global aviation hub in Kentucky.

The crash Tuesday at UPS Worldport in Louisville killed 14 people, including the three pilots on the MD-11 that was headed for Honolulu.

MD-11 aircrafts make up about 9% of of the UPS airline fleet and 4% of the FedEx fleet, the companies said.

“We made this decision proactively at the recommendation of the aircraft manufacturer,” a UPS statement said late Friday. “Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.”

FedEx said in an email that it will be grounding the aircrafts while it conducts “a thorough safety review based on the recommendation of the manufacturer.”

Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, said in a statement on its website that it “recommended to the three operators of the MD-11 Freighter that they suspend flight operations while additional engineering analysis is performed.”

Western Global Airlines is the only other U.S. cargo airline that flies MD-11s, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. The airline has 16 MD-11s in its fleet but 12 of them have already been put in storage. The company did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment outside of business hours early Saturday.

Boeing announced in 1998 that it would be phasing out its MD-11 jetliner production, with final deliveries due in 2000.

The UPS cargo plane, built in 1991, was nearly airborne Tuesday when a bell sounded in the cockpit, National Transportation Safety Board member Todd Inman said earlier Friday. For the next 25 seconds, the bell rang and the pilots tried to control the aircraft as it barely lifted off the runway, its left wing ablaze and missing an engine, and then plowed into the ground in a spectacular fireball.




The cockpit voice recorder captured the bell, which sounded about 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust, Inman said. There are different types of alarms with varying meanings, he said, and investigators haven't determined why the bell rang, though they know the left wing was burning and the engine on that side had detached.

Inman said it would be months before a transcript of the cockpit recording is made public as part of that investigation process.

Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, said the bell likely was signaling the engine fire.

“It occurred at a point in the takeoff where they were likely past their decision speed to abort the takeoff,” Guzzetti told The Associated Press after Inman's news conference. “They were likely past their critical decision speed to remain on the runway and stop safely. … They'll need to thoroughly investigate the options the crew may or may not have had.”

Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball. Footage from phones, cars and security cameras has given investigators evidence of what happened from many different angles.

Flight records suggest the UPS MD-11 that crashed underwent maintenance while it was on the ground in San Antonio for more than a month until mid-October. It is not clear what work was done.

The UPS package handling facility in Louisville is the company's largest. The hub employs more than 20,000 people in the region, handles 300 flights daily and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour.

UPS Worldport operations resumed Wednesday night with its Next Day Air, or night sort, operation, spokesperson Jim Mayer said.

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Joe Biden slowly but steadily walked onto the stage in Omaha on Friday. As he did, 800 people in the downtown Hilton ballroom rose to their feet cheering. 

“Did you see the results Tuesday?” he asked, igniting another round of cheers as he listed Democratic victories from governorships in New Jersey and Virginia to the mayoral seat in New York to a redistricting decision in California. 

It was a joyful return to the political stage for the former president, whose party's effort to remain in the White House was rejected just over a year ago. Biden called for a political comeback, though not for himself, but to an audience hungry for a fight. 

“You know what it feels like to be outnumbered,” he told Democrats in Nebraska, where Republicans have carried the state in every presidential election since 1968. “But every election, you put up the yard signs and you make your voices heard. The country needs you badly.”

It was the kind of pep talk that sells in a place where Democrats lose statewide but have staged winning races for the Omaha area's 2nd District electoral vote, elected a Democratic mayor for the first time since 2009 and feel energized about capturing the 2nd District seat in 2026. 

Biden heaped on the encouragement, but returned repeatedly to his view of his lone term's high points, curbing COVID-19 and beginning the economic recovery from the epidemic. 




He didn't touch the difficulties he had last year, nor the year of debate Democrats have engaged in over how they lost the presidency to Republican Donald Trump. 

In the summer of 2024, Biden waited more than three weeks from his disastrous debate performance in June with Trump, prompting panic among Democrats, before announcing in July he would not seek another term, and then endorsing then-Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor on the ticket. 

Harris had written in a book published in September that she and others in Biden's orbit should have been more aggressive in encouraging him to consider stepping aside sooner. 

The closest Biden came to acknowledging the difficult decision was an oblique joke. 

“I have the dubious distinction. I'm the youngest ever man elected to the U.S. Senate and I'm the oldest damn president,” he playfully rued. 

Although Biden's delivery was quiet but upbeat, he at times garbled his words and was sometimes so quiet he was inaudible from the amplified podium. Yet he would come charging back with fiery attacks on the Trump administration and calls for action. 

“What we have to do is repair our faults, and that's what we began to do on Tuesday,” he shouted. 

Tuesday's victories, a boon to Democrats across the country, were a timely lift for Biden. 

But he also benefited from an atmosphere of respect. 

Earlier in the program, he remained seated but beamed when the audience stood after Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, also a guest at the fundraiser, hailed him “for a lifetime of service to our country.”

“He was a president who governed not for red states, not for blue states but for the entire United States,” said Beshear. 

Throughout Biden's 30-minute remarks, the audience rose cheering. He returned to well-worn campaign themes promoting the middle class, equality and the nation's responsibility as an example to other nations. 

He called them principles “we've never walked away from.” Straining to punctuate by raising his voice, he said, “We're not going to walk away from them now.” 

It was Biden's second public appearance in the past week, and second since completing a round of radiation therapy treatment in October for the aggressive form of prostate cancer he was diagnosed with after leaving office. He said nothing of his health, and when he mentioned cancer it was not about his own. It was about his late son Beau, who died in 2015. 

It was the first purely political appearance for Biden since Labor Day 2024, when he appeared with Harris for a labor event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a full two months before the Nov. 5, 2024, election. 

If his decision making about the 2024 race were in question in the audience Friday, it seemed a distant memory as he wrapped his speech. 

“Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!” they chatted as he left the stage.

A federal judge permanently blocked President Donald Trump on Friday from deploying the National Guard to Portland, where the administration has cited clashes between anti-ICE protesters and federal officers as justifying the military presence.

United States District Judge Karin Immergut found that the federal government violated the 10th Amendment and Title 10, Section 12406 of the U.S. Code by sending National Guard troops to the city of Oregon in late September to guard an ICE office building.

“The evidence demonstrates that these deployments, which were objected to by Oregon's governor and not requested by the federal officials in charge of protection of the ICE building, exceeded the President's authority,” the Trump-appointed judge wrote in the 106-page order.

The final ruling follows a preliminary injunction that prevented troops from being deployed until 5 p.m. local time on Friday.

Immergut held a three-day trial last week featuring testimony from federal, state, and local law enforcement officials regarding Trump's claims that protests over federal immigration operations prompted him to activate the National Guard to protect federal assets and officials. Based on the compiled evidence, the judge said the administration's claims of unruly violence before the deployment were largely unfounded.

“While violent protests did occur in June, they quickly abated due to the efforts of civil law enforcement officers. And since that brief span of a few days in June, the protests outside the Portland ICE facility have been predominantly peaceful, with only isolated and sporadic instances of relatively low-level violence, largely between protesters and counterprotesters,” she wrote.

Though the ruling is a setback for the federal government, Immergut noted it does not preclude Trump from deploying the National Guard to Oregon in the future if there is justification for doing so. She said that the conditions in Portland did not meet the bar.

“When considering these conditions that persisted for months before the President's federalization of the National Guard, this Court concludes that even giving great deference to the President's determination, the President did not have a lawful basis to federalize the National Guard,” Immergut said.

The ruling allows the Oregon National Guard to remain under federal control for at least 14 days. However, the National Guard units from Texas and California that were deployed to Oregon are immediately barred under the preliminary injunction.

An appeal is likely to be filed by the Trump administration, considering federal lawyers indicated as much during last week's trial.

JUDGE EXTENDS BLOCK ON PORTLAND NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT THROUGH FRIDAY

“President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters,” Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in response to the ruling. “The President's lawful actions will make Portland safer.”

Meanwhile, Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Chicago has faced similar court orders from a federal judge and an appeals court. The Supreme Court is currently considering a petition on its emergency docket to lift the block on the Chicago deployment.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) slammed his Republican colleagues on Friday for failing to denounce Tucker Carlson amid the fallout from the conservative pundit's interview with Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist who has contributed to the recent rise in antisemitism online.

“My colleagues, almost to a person, think what is happening is horrible, but a great many of them are frightened because he has one hell of a big megaphone,” Cruz said of Carlson at the Federalist Society's National Lawyers Convention in Washington, D.C.

The senator has ramped up his criticism of the former Fox News host ever since Fuentes appeared on The Tucker Carlson Show last week. The two-hour-plus interview was characterized by Carlson's failure to directly challenge Fuentes's points. Carlson's treatment of Fuentes on the show was in direct contrast to the pundit's heated interview with Cruz in June.

The fallout from the Carlson-Fuentes interview has been notable, as it has led to several resignations at the Heritage Foundation. The conservative think tank was caught in the right-wing backlash when its president, Kevin Roberts, defended Carlson while decrying the “venomous coalition” attacking his “close friend.” Roberts later apologized for the “venomous coalition” comment.

“Their attempt to cancel [Carlson] will fail,” he said in a video on Oct. 30. “I disagree with, and even abhor, things that Nick Fuentes says, but canceling him is not the answer either. When we disagree with a person's thoughts and opinions, we challenge those ideas and debate.”

Cruz argued Carlson didn't challenge Fuentes enough on his antisemitic claims.

“The last I checked, Tucker actually knows how to cross-examine,” he said, referring to his conversation with Carlson.

The Texas Republican previously spoke about this very issue at last weekend's Republican Jewish Coalition annual summit in Las Vegas, where he described antisemitism as a “poison” and an “existential crisis in our party and in our country.” He also charged his fellow Republicans to speak out, saying each one is a “coward” if “you say nothing.”

“Too many people are scared to confront it,” Cruz said of the surge in antisemitism on the right side of the aisle. “How many elected Republicans do you see standing up and calling this out?”

“I am committed to calling out this garbage. I am committed to fighting this garbage,” he added. “And I am committed to going to young people and saying, ‘These are poisonous lies.'”

TED CRUZ HEAPS CRITICISM ON TUCKER CARLSON OVER NICK FUENTES INTERVIEW

The senator noted that while he doesn't have a problem with Carlson and Fuentes exercising their First Amendment rights, others have an “obligation to stand up and say it is wrong.”

“It's easy right now to denounce Fuentes,” he said to the audience. “Are you willing to say Tucker's name?”

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A federal judge in Oregon ruled Friday that President Donald Trump's administration failed to meet the legal requirements for deploying the National Guard to Portland after the city and state sued in September to block the deployment.

The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial last week in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law. 

The administration said the troops were needed to protect federal personnel and property in a city that Trump described as “war ravaged” with “fires all over the place.”

In a 106-page opinion, Immergut found that even though the president is entitled to “great deference” in his decision on whether to call up the Guard, he did not have a legal basis for doing so because he did not establish that there was a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or that he was unable to enforce the law with regular forces.

“The trial record showed that although protests outside the Portland ICE building occurred nightly between June and October 2025, ever since a few particularly disruptive days in mid-June, protests have remained peaceful with only isolated and sporadic instances of violence,” Immergut wrote. “The occasional interference to federal officers has been minimal, and there is no evidence that these small-scale protests have significantly impeded the execution of any immigration laws.” 

The Trump administration criticized the judge's ruling.

“The facts haven't changed. Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman.




“The courts are holding this administration accountable to the truth and the rule of law,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in an e-mailed statement. “From the beginning, this case has been about making sure that facts, not political whims, guide how the law is applied. Today's decision protects that principle.”

Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue — have been pushing back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states' sovereignty.

Immergut issued two orders in early October that had blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. The first order blocked Trump from deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard; the second, issued a day later, blocked him from deploying members of any state's National Guard to Oregon, after he tried to evade the first order by sending California troops instead.

Immergut has called Trump's apocalyptic descriptions of Portland “simply untethered to the facts.”

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has already ordered that the troops not be deployed pending further action by the appeals court. The trial Immergut held further developed the factual record in the case, which could serve as the basis for further appellate rulings.

Witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city's ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Trump's National Guard announcement.

The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a “rebellion” or “danger of rebellion.” 

Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., because of safety concerns.

R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland's ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem or Trump. He also said he was “surprised” to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down.

Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified.

The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer because of property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Former colleagues are mourning three pilots killed in a UPS cargo plane crash in Louisville, Kentucky, as relatives of a man who was pulled from the wreckage confirm he's among those who died.

Capt. Richard Wartenberg, First Officer Lee Truitt and International Relief Officer Capt. Dana Diamond were on board when the crash happened during takeoff Tuesday at UPS Worldport, the company's global aviation hub located at Muhammad Ali International Airport.

At least 11 others died, including Matt Sweets, who suffered widespread burn wounds. Many of the victims still have not been identified.

Todd Inman of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the ongoing investigation, has said the plane had been cleared for takeoff when a large fire developed in the left wing and an engine fell off. A recording indicates a repeating bell sounded in the cockpit for 25 seconds as pilots tried to control the aircraft, Inman said Friday.

Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball. Footage from phones, cars and security cameras has helped investigators piece together what happened from many different angles. 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




From 1994 until 2016, Wartenberg served with the 445th Airlift Wing at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, according to a statement from the wing.

The retired lieutenant colonel and former reservist received his commission through Air Force Officer Training School and throughout his career had qualifications in the C-141 Starlifter, C-5 Galaxy and the C-17 Globemaster III. He had logged more than 5,000 military flight hours when he retired as a command pilot, the release said.




In 2010, he received the Meritorious Service Medal.

Wartenberg lived in Independence, Kentucky, south of Cincinnati, according to public records.

He also spent more than two decades as a member of the Ohio Valley Region Porsche Club of America, a group of enthusiasts of Porsche vehicles. The club holds events such as autocrosses and high-performance driving education at regional sports car tracks.

Truitt had been a pilot for UPS since 2021, flying the MD-11 airliner, and lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before that, he was a captain for SkyWest Airlines and a flight instructor at Bode Aviation. He studied Spanish language and literature at the University of New Mexico and graduated in 2006.

John H. Bode, the president and CEO of Bode Aviation, called Truitt “a cherished friend, a trusted colleague, and a model of what it means to be a true professional aviator.” 

Truitt “demonstrated an unwavering commitment to excellence, earning the respect and admiration of everyone he worked alongside,” Bode wrote in a statement. “Through diligence, humility, and an unrelenting pursuit of mastery, Lee rose to serve as a Senior Flight Instructor and Charter Pilot, where his discipline, composure, and integrity became the standard by which others measured themselves. His dedication to his craft was matched only by his generosity of spirit — he continually returned to mentor our students and instructors, guiding the next generation of aviators with patience, wisdom, and care.”

Diamond previously served as commissioner and chief of Bastrop County Emergency Services District No. 1 in Texas. The emergency services agency said in a social media tribute that it was “deeply saddened” by his death.

“He ran towards danger so the rest of us can step back from it and that kind of devotion to his community leaves a mark on everyone it touches,” the agency said. “He leaves behind not only a legacy of service but also the memories with fellow firefighters and the community he served. His contribution to the citizens of Bastrop County Texas are immeasurable.

“May his family find comfort in knowing he served our community to make it a better place and may we honor his memory.”

Diamond lived in Caldwell, Texas, according to public records.

Matt Sweets, who was badly burned in the blaze and hospitalized, died Thursday afternoon, according to a social media post by his sister, Michelle Sweets.

“For now, please keep his girlfriend Brooke and his two young children in your prayers as well as the rest of us,” she wrote.

Carrie Ryan, another sister of Matt Sweets, thanked the “brave man who pulled him from the wreckage and got him to help.” But she said there was nothing anyone could have done to save her brother. She said his children didn't deserve this.

“But we will make sure they grow up knowing their dad was the most loyal, kind, and caring man — and how lucky they are to have you watching over them,” she wrote.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday accused foreign-owned meat packers of driving up the price of beef in the U.S. and asked the Department of Justice to open an investigation.

The Republican president announced the move on social media days after his party suffered losses in key elections in which the winning Democratic candidates focused relentlessly on the public's concerns about the cost of living. But experts said it's unlikely that an investigation would result in lower prices at grocery stores, and a trade group representing meat packers said they're not to blame.

Trump did not present evidence for his claims, writing on social media that “I have asked the DOJ to immediately begin an investigation into the Meat Packing Companies who are driving up the price of Beef through Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation.”

He said he was taking the action to help ranchers, who were recently angered by his suggestion that the U.S. would buy Argentine beef to bring down stubbornly high prices for American consumers.

“We will always protect our American Ranchers, and they are being blamed for what is being done by Majority Foreign Owned Meat Packers, who artificially inflate prices, and jeopardize the security of our Nation's food supply,” Trump said.




Beef prices have soared to record levels in part after drought and years of low prices led to the smallest U.S. herd size in decades. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, a major beef exporter, have also curbed imports.

Meanwhile, demand for beef remains strong. Prices are high because consumers want to eat it, and they're willing and able to pay for it, said Glynn Tonsor, who leads the Meat Demand Monitor at Kansas State University.

Tonsor said the ownership mix in the meat packing industry has not changed significantly in the past four years.

Concentration in the meat packing business has been a longtime concern for farmers and politicians on both sides of the aisle. Four major meatpacking companies dominate the beef market in the United States.

There's no evidence to back up claims that the big packers have undue market power and use it to drive up beef prices, said Derrell Peel, an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University.

“The packing industry in this country has been investigated and researched for 50 years, and it's been an issue for over a hundred years, at least, for some producers,” Peel said, expressing skepticism that consumers or producers will benefit from the investigation Trump announced.

“If the outcome is to break up the big packers, the outcome will be higher beef prices for consumers, and lower cattle prices for producers,” Peel said.

Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin said Friday that he and fellow Republican senators Cindy-Hyde-Smith of Mississippi and Tim Sheehy of Montana visited the White House earlier in the day to speak with Trump about recent volatility in the beef market. Mullin said Trump agreed to have the Justice Department look at the issue.

Mullin blamed meat processors, saying that “we're seeing the same exact game play again out” as a 2019 lawsuit against large meatpackers for violating antitrust laws.

JBS, which is based in Brazil, is the largest U.S. beef producer and its second-largest producer of poultry and pork. Half of its annual revenue comes from the U.S., where it has more than 72,000 employees.

The company has faced price-fixing charges before. In 2022, JBS agreed to a $52.5 million settlement with grocery stores and wholesalers who accused JBS, Arkansas-based Tyson Foods and other companies of working together to suppress the number of cattle being slaughtered in order to drive up beef prices. 

JBS did not admit wrongdoing as part of that settlement. Messages seeking comment were left Friday with JBS USA.

Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., last week called on the administration to renew an investigation into meat packers that was opened in Trump's first term. Cramer's office said he has pushed for such a probe since March 2020. 

The Meat Institute, a trade group that represents JBS and other meat producers, said its industry is being pinched by the price of cattle, despite record prices for U.S. beef.

“For more than a year, beef packers have been operating at a loss due to a tight cattle supply and strong demand,” Meat Institute President and CEO Julie Anna Potts said in a statement. “The beef industry is heavily regulated, and market transactions are transparent. The government's own data from USDA confirms that the beef packing sector is experiencing catastrophic losses and experts predict this will continue into 2026.”

Trump's accusations have renewed a bipartisan presidential fight against rising food prices.

Then-President Joe Biden talked with independent farmers and ranchers about initiatives to reduce food prices by increasing competition within the meat industry. And then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who Trump defeated in winning reelection last year, used her campaign to vow to crack down on food producers and major supermarkets' “ price gouging.”

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson granted the Trump administration's request Friday night to halt a lower court's order to issue full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits using funds intended for child nutrition.

Jackson granted the request to halt the order pending a ruling on a stay pending appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, writing in her order that the administrative stay will expire 48 hours after the First Circuit issues its ruling.

The petition to the Supreme Court's emergency docket came less than an hour after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit declined to grant an administrative stay of U.S. District Judge John McConnell's Thursday order that Section 32 Child Nutrition Funds be used to issue full SNAP benefits by Friday. In its order denying the administrative stay earlier this evening, the First Circuit stated that it would still consider the request for a stay pending appeal, promising a decision on it “as quickly as possible.”

Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the high court to issue an administrative stay of the lower court's orders by 9:30 p.m. Friday. Jackson's order was posted roughly 13 minutes before that time.

Sauer asserted SNAP may only be funded using the SNAP contingency reserve, which would cover roughly half of the benefits for November, and that McConnell's order to use Section 32 funds to issue full SNAP benefits is unlawful.

“That unprecedented injunction makes a mockery of the separation of powers. The core power of Congress is that of the purse, while the Executive is tasked with allocating limited resources across competing priorities,” Sauer wrote in the petition.

“But here, the court below took the current shutdown as an effective license to declare a federal bankruptcy and appoint itself the trustee, charged with picking winners and losers among those seeking some part of the limited pool of remaining federal funds,” Sauer added. “The district court's ruling is untenable at every turn.”

Sauer warned that if the high court allowed McConnell's order to stand, it would “sow further shutdown chaos” with groups attempting to force funding to their favored programs via court orders.

“Courts would issue unworkable and potentially conflicting injunctions, as different judges order different allocations of limited pools of money,” Sauer wrote. “District courts' seizure of the power to allocate federal agency funds as they see fit would also invite a run on the bank by way of judicial fiat during this shutdown, as litigants race to courthouse to obtain their guarantee of federal funds before it is too late.”

Sauer urged the high court to issue its ruling quickly, noting that it is currently required to use Section 32 funding to send full SNAP benefits by tonight due to McConnell's order.

JUDGE ORDERS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO USE CHILD NUTRITION FUNDS TO ISSUE FULL SNAP BENEFITS

“Once those billions are out the door, there is no ready mechanism for the government to recover those funds—to the significant detriment of those other critical social programs whose budgets the district court ordered the government to raid,” Sauer wrote.

With the government shutdown now the longest in history and with no clear end in sight, the administration had warned that SNAP benefits would not be paid out for November. The announcement prompted multiple lawsuits and orders requiring the administration to use other funds to pay for SNAP. The administration has maintained that only congressionally appropriated SNAP funds may lawfully be used for the program.

President Donald Trump proposed a compromise on health insurance payments, calling on Republicans to send federal payments that would go to insurers under the Affordable Care Act directly to Americans to bring an end to the government shutdown.

"I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over," he wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday, without providing any details.

The post comes one day after Senate Republicans rejected Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's deal that would have allowed the U.S. government to reopen after a shutdown that began Oct. 1. The shutdown is now the longest in U.S. history.

The plan Democrats put forward on Friday proposed protecting federal ACA subsidies for at least one year, in exchange for dropping their demand that a longer-term extension of Obamacare tax credits be included in a stopgap government funding bill.

Those subsidies, which more than 20 million Americans use, will expire at the end of December if Congress does not extend them.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday called the Democrats' proposal a "non-starter."

The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment or specifics on how Trump's proposed direct payment plan would work.

Representatives for Sens. Schumer and Thune did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The D.C. offices for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Congressional lawmakers have been in a stalemate, unable to find a compromise to end the shutdown. Democrats want a funding bill to include health-care subsidies that are due to expire for 24 million Americans at year's end. Republicans, meanwhile, say Congress must first pass a funding bill without strings attached and allow the government to reopen before tackling other issues.

In the same post, Trump reiterated his call for terminating the filibuster, the Senate rule requiring 60 of its 100 members to pass most legislation. The GOP holds 53 seats in the Senate. There are 45 Democratic senators, and two independents who caucus with them.

Senate Republicans have pushed back on changing the rule, saying they would not support a change this week as Trump called for his party to exercise what he called "the Nuclear Option" on the rule.

Many restaurants may need to rethink their mandatory gratuity policies if they want this income to count as qualified tips for their workers under the new tax laws.

The "no tax on tips" provision in President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in "qualified tips" per year from 2025 through 2028. The rub is that mandatory gratuities, the 15% to 20% that restaurants often impose on parties of six people or more, aren't eligible for the deduction, a disappointment to the restaurant and foodservice industry, which held out hope for a different outcome.

The industry is the country's second-largest private-sector employer, providing 15.7 million jobs, or 10% of the total U.S. workforce, according to a data brief from the National Restaurant Association based on the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey.

The service fee issue is sure to resonate with many restaurateurs. Research from the National Restaurant Association shows that 54% of full-service operators — including 67% of fine-dining operators — say their restaurants sometimes add a service charge or automatic gratuity to customer checks. Among this group, 12% add the service charge or automatic gratuity to all checks, while 88% only add it to parties that exceed a specific number of people (typically six or more) or to banquets, private events or catering events. 

Notably, the Internal Revenue Service has never considered these service fees as tips. However, the restaurant industry hasn't necessarily followed the letter of the law, according to Jean Hagan, a partner at Eisner Advisory Group who focuses on the restaurant industry. 

Hagan said during a recent webinar for a large state restaurant association, many proprietors were surprised to learn they weren't supposed to be counting service fees as tips. "They've just always been doing it a certain way — passing on the service fees to employees as a tip," Hagan said. 

Now, however, restaurants will have to put all tips through payroll, even if they weren't doing it before, or were incorrectly including service fees, so that the employee can benefit from the deduction. There will be more pressure on restaurants to do it properly. "They've got to clean their systems up and follow the law as it's always been," Hagan said. "If they don't, the employee won't get the full benefit of the new tax law." 

Some advocates for the restaurant industry have been lobbying to change the way service fees are treated. They'd like to see automatic gratuities included as tips. The Culinary Union in Nevada, for example, submitted formal recommendations to the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS that automatic gratuities and suggested tips both be treated as eligible tip income. Separately, several members of Congress from Nevada had asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to ensure that automatic gratuities are deemed eligible for the tips deduction. 

"Functionally, for employees, there is no distinction between auto-gratuity and a tip, and inclusion of this income as eligible will prevent arbitrary distinctions between tip practices that would disadvantage workers based solely on the business model of their employer," lawmakers wrote in an Aug. 12 letter.

However, upending the long-standing distinction between service fees and tips doesn't appear likely. In September, the IRS issued proposed rules on the new "no tax on tips" deduction. The rules aren't final yet, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of wiggle room, since the language within the OBBBA is unambiguous — the tip has to be voluntary. "Congressional intent is pretty clear," said Andrew Lautz, director of tax policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center. "What's unclear is how restaurants respond to that," he added. 

Some restaurants are taking a wait-and-see approach.

"Restaurant operators are watching closely for the final 'No Tax on Tips' rules from the IRS and will evaluate any shift in their restaurant's current policies on tipping so that it best suits their tipped employees' desires," Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs for the National Restaurant Association, wrote in an email.

"These employees have chosen a restaurant job because of the income potential they get from tipping, so operators want to make sure that they can take full advantage of the tax credit while it is available to them," he wrote.

Some restaurants are "consulting with their accountants, point-of-sale providers, and teams to determine what approach works best for their business and employees," said a spokesperson for the Texas Restaurant Association.

Some business owners may decide to make changes for competitive reasons. "For restaurants who use the commission-based model or utilize service charges, those servers would likely consider it a disadvantage to forego $25,000 of tax-free income when they could potentially move to a restaurant that does not utilize service charges and are therefore eligible for tax-free tips up to $25,000," said a spokesperson for The Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association.

Even though the regulations regarding these rules are not yet final, industry participants aren't expecting much to change with respect to service fees and tip eligibility. At a hearing in October, the IRS reiterated that it is maintaining the stance that service fees aren't eligible for the deduction, said Scott Klein, senior manager of tax policy and advocacy for the American Institute of CPAs, who attended the hearing. That's not likely to change in the final regulations, he said.

In its September guidance, the IRS offered several examples of how restaurants can respond so their employees can eke out the most benefit from the deduction under the rules. "If a customer is expressly provided an option to disregard or modify amounts added to a bill, such amounts are not mandatory amounts," the guidance states. 

Say, for example, that a restaurant's menu states that an automatic 18% charge will be added to all bills for parties of six or more customers. Even if the restaurant distributes this amount to waitstaff, it is not a qualified tip for purposes of the deduction, the IRS said. However, if the restaurant adds a line labeled "additional tip amount" and the customer adds in an amount equal to 2% of the price for food and beverages, the 2% can be considered a qualified tip.

Another option would be for the restaurant to include a "recommended tip" equal to 18% of the price for food and beverages, and include a line for the customer to subtract (including to zero) or add to the recommended tip amount before paying the bill. Say the customer subtracts 3% from the recommended tip amount, resulting in a tip of 15%. The 15% amount that the customer voluntarily paid is a qualified tip in this scenario, according to the IRS.

In another example provided by the IRS, a server presents a customer's bill on an electronic handheld point-of-sale device, which offers the option to pay 15%, 18%, 20%, other, or no tip. Because the customer has a right to determine the additional amount and was expressly provided the option to leave no tip, the amount chosen is a qualified tip. If, however, the customer was not given an option to modify the amount or leave zero tip, the amount selected would not be a qualified tip for purposes of the deduction.

As restaurant owners and employees weigh their options, the clock is ticking. Because President Trump's OBBBA is so new, and the IRS is still crafting the applicable regulations, the situation is complicated for restaurants and other businesses whose employees want to claim a deduction for 2025. The AICPA had asked the Treasury Department and the IRS to include a safe harbor for businesses for this tax year, which the IRS issued in early November. This means employers will not face penalties for "failing to provide a separate accounting of any amounts reasonably designated as cash tips or the occupation of the person receiving such tips."

This safe harbor only applies to tax year 2025.

For millions of Americans, it is an uncertain time.

Amazon, General Motors and Paramount have all been making layoffs, and U.S.-based employers announced 153,074 job cuts in October altogether, according to research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

The government shutdown has also left hundreds of thousands of workers without pay, millions of SNAP recipients without funds to feed themselves and their families, and now thousands of travelers with reduced flight options.

There are ways to cope that don't exacerbate the financial anxiety you might be feeling. For example, financial therapist Aja Evans recommends leaning into self-care activities that cost little to no money, like going outside and spending time with family and friends.

But there's a mindset shift people can make as well.

Instead of experiencing uncertainty as an anomaly, remember that "uncertainty is fundamental reality," says best-selling author and wellness guru Deepak Chopra. "Every moment we breathe, live and move in uncertainty, pretending that it's certainty."

The 79-year-old recently launched a wellness platform offering various meditations, live digital sessions with him and a Deepak Chopra AI chatbot drawing from his decades of writing and talks that users can interact with directly.

Instead of thinking of uncertainty as an inhibitor in your life, think of it as a chance to try something new. "In every uncertain event," says Chopra, "there is the seed for a greater opportunity and creativity."

That creativity can lead to fresh problem solving in whatever difficult circumstance you're facing and solutions you haven't considered before.

Creativity is "a new story, a new paradigm, a new way of dealing with relationships, new context and new meaning," he says.

When you feel that anxiety creeping in about an unclear future, "start with the presumption that life is uncertain," says Chopra. "When you start with that, you welcome the unknown."

Neurodiverse professionals may see unique benefits from artificial intelligence tools and agents, research suggests. With AI agent creation booming in 2025, people with conditions like ADHD, autism, dyslexia and more report a more level playing field in the workplace thanks to generative AI.

A recent study from the UK's Department for Business and Trade found that neurodiverse workers were 25% more satisfied with AI assistants and were more likely to recommend the tool than neurotypical respondents.

"Standing up and walking around during a meeting means that I'm not taking notes, but now AI can come in and synthesize the entire meeting into a transcript and pick out the top-level themes," said Tara DeZao, senior director of product marketing at enterprise low-code platform provider Pega. DeZao, who was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, has combination-type ADHD, which includes both inattentive symptoms (time management and executive function issues) and hyperactive symptoms (increased movement).

"I've white-knuckled my way through the business world," DeZao said. "But these tools help so much."

AI tools in the workplace run the gamut and can have hyper-specific use cases, but solutions like note takers, schedule assistants and in-house communication support are common. Generative AI happens to be particularly adept at skills like communication, time management and executive functioning, creating a built-in benefit for neurodiverse workers who've previously had to find ways to fit in among a work culture not built with them in mind.

Because of the skills that neurodiverse individuals can bring to the workplace — hyperfocus, creativity, empathy and niche expertise, just to name a few — some research suggests that organizations prioritizing inclusivity in this space generate nearly one-fifth higher revenue.

"Investing in ethical guardrails, like those that protect and aid neurodivergent workers, is not just the right thing to do," said Kristi Boyd, an AI specialist with the SAS data ethics practice. "It's a smart way to make good on your organization's AI investments."

Boyd referred to an SAS study which found that companies investing the most in AI governance and guardrails were 1.6 times more likely to see at least double ROI on their AI investments. But Boyd highlighted three risks that companies should be aware of when implementing AI tools with neurodiverse and other individuals in mind: competing needs, unconscious bias and inappropriate disclosure.

"Different neurodiverse conditions may have conflicting needs," Boyd said. For example, while people with dyslexia may benefit from document readers, people with bipolar disorder or other mental health neurodivergences may benefit from AI-supported scheduling to make the most of productive periods. "By acknowledging these tensions upfront, organizations can create layered accommodations or offer choice-based frameworks that balance competing needs while promoting equity and inclusion," she explained.

Regarding AI's unconscious biases, algorithms can (and have been) unintentionally taught to associate neurodivergence with danger, disease or negativity, as outlined in Duke University research. And even today, neurodiversity can still be met with workplace discrimination, making it important for companies to provide safe ways to use these tools without having to unwillingly publicize any individual worker diagnosis.

As businesses take accountability for the impact of AI tools in the workplace, Boyd says it's important to remember to include diverse voices at all stages, implement regular audits and establish safe ways for employees to anonymously report issues.

The work to make AI deployment more equitable, including for neurodivergent people, is just getting started. The nonprofit Humane Intelligence, which focuses on deploying AI for social good, released in early October its Bias Bounty Challenge, where participants can identify biases with the goal of building "more inclusive communication platforms — especially for users with cognitive differences, sensory sensitivities or alternative communication styles."

For example, emotion AI (when AI identifies human emotions) can help people with difficulty identifying emotions make sense of their meeting partners on video conferencing platforms like Zoom. Still, this technology requires careful attention to bias by ensuring AI agents recognize diverse communication patterns fairly and accurately, rather than embedding harmful assumptions.

DeZao said her ADHD diagnosis felt like "somebody turned on the light in a very, very dark room."

"One of the most difficult pieces of our hyper-connected, fast world is that we're all expected to multitask. With my form of ADHD, it's almost impossible to multitask," she said.

DeZao says one of AI's most helpful features is its ability to receive instructions and do its work while the human employee can remain focused on the task at hand. "If I'm working on something and then a new request comes in over Slack or Teams, it just completely knocks me off my thought process," she said. "Being able to take that request and then outsource it real quick and have it worked on while I continue to work [on my original task] has been a godsend."

U.S. Bank and Bank of America cards are currently not available on CNBC Select and links have been redirected to our credit card marketplace where you can review offers from other issuers like American Express or Chase. You can also check out our list of best credit cards for alternative options.

The American Express Platinum Card® is packed with a seemingly endless list of perks in exchange for an $895 annual fee (see rates and fees) — but not everyone wants to pay such a princely sum for the entire slate of benefits — and you don't have to. 

Other cards offer similar benefits at a much lower price — in some cases without an annual fee at all. We looked at a few of the best perks of the Amex Platinum Card and figured out how to closely replicate them cheaply. We prioritized cards in this order: those without an annual fee, those with an annual fee under $100 and a couple that have an annual fee that's waived the first year. 

Of course, the Amex Platinum has a few benefits that can't be duplicated, like Centurion Lounge access, but you can get a card or two that offer similar benefits with a much lower price tag.

Did you know Amex Platinum's rental car coverage* is actually secondary? Shocking but true. In fact, Amex requires you to enroll in premium rental car protection and pay either $19.95 or $24.95 every time you rent if you want primary coverage. 

A big benefit of the premium rental car protection is that you're covered for up to 42 consecutive days (up to 30 days for Washington State residents), whereas other plans typically end after 31 consecutive days. That won't matter if your trips are usually less than a month, but it's worth pointing out. 

To get primary rental car insurance without an $895 annual fee or additional fee for every rental, get the Bilt Mastercard®.

You might've heard of the Bilt Mastercard® if you're a renter because it allows you to earn points on rent without any transaction fees and has no annual fee. Its primary rental car insurance covers up to $50,000 in damage or theft (except for New York residents renting within the United States, then it's secondary).

That's an excellent benefit for a no-annual-fee credit card that earns points that transfer to a long list of partners like Air Canada Aeroplan, Alaska Atmos Rewards and United MileagePlus. 

*Car Rental Loss and Damage Insurance can provide coverage up to $75,000 for theft of or damage to most rental vehicles when you use your eligible Card to reserve and pay for the entire eligible vehicle rental and decline the collision damage waiver or similar option offered by the Commercial Car Rental Company. This product provides secondary coverage and does not include liability coverage. Not all vehicle types or rentals are covered. Geographic restrictions apply. Eligibility and Benefit level varies by Card. Terms, Conditions and Limitations Apply. Please visit americanexpress.com/benefitsguide for more details. Underwritten by AMEX Assurance Company.

Activist Commentary: Carl Icahn is the grandfather of shareholder activism and a true pioneer of the strategy. He is very passionate about shareholder rights and good corporate governance and will go to extreme lengths to fight incompetent boards and over compensated managers. Icahn has invested across all sectors over his more than six-decade long career and has a long history in the automotive parts and services industry. He has been involved in several mergers and acquisitions in this space, acquiring some of his portfolio companies through Icahn Automotive, the automotive-segment business of his conglomerate, Icahn Enterprises. This includes his acquisition of Pep Boys-Manny Moe and Jack in 2016 and Federal Mogul in 2017.

On Nov. 5, Carl Icahn filed a 13D with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosing a 14.79% position in Monro.

Monro is engaged in the provision of automotive undercar repair and tire services in the United States, operating more than 1,100 repair shops and tire dealers in 32 states under multiple regional brands. The company has faced several challenges in recent years. Macro factors like lower consumer demand, higher material and labor costs, and a trend in consumer trade-down to lower margin tire products have applied significant margin and growth pressure. As a result, following a 4.9% decrease in sales for fiscal year 2025 — the second year in a row with a meaningful decline in revenue — the company announced that they are closing approximately 145 underperforming locations. 

Most recently, the company's third-quarter earnings report left a lot of investors disappointed about its strategic transition, with weaker-than-expected revenue and no specific financial guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. Shares fell 16.7% the next day. Lastly, many investors have questioned the company's dividend payout ratio, which has remained relatively large despite these ongoing struggles. 

Putting all this together, it comes as little surprise that shares have underperformed, down 44.73%, 66.73% and 63.25% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively, prior to Icahn's announcement.

Perhaps this depressed valuation is what caught the eye of Carl Icahn. He disclosed a 14.79% position in the company (67% of which was acquired since the stock's Oct. 29 downturn), immediately sending the stock up over 15%. 

While there are plenty of cheap stocks, this isn't Icahn taking a flyer on the automotive industry. Icahn has a rich history in the automotive parts and services industry, most notably Icahn Automotive, the automotive segment of his conglomerate, Icahn Enterprises. Icahn knows this industry well and likely sees Monro as a great business that is significantly undervalued. 

The timing of this public engagement is also very notable. It is not just the stock's recent fall that makes this a good entry point for an investor like Icahn. Monro recently agreed to collapse its dual class share structure, which had previously granted its sole Class C shareholder, Peter Solomon, veto power over any matter brought to a shareholder vote, effectively making this a controlled company. Pursuant to its approval in 2023, this collapse will occur prior to the 2026 annual meeting, which is expected to take place next August. 

So, what does this mean for the company's shareholders? It effectively sets the stage for the company being converted from a privately run company to a publicly run company for the benefit of its shareholders. With one person having veto power over all material board decisions, the rest of the board becomes somewhat irrelevant. With this conversion, the company has an opportunity to have a real, collaborative, and productive board. This would require its reconstitution, and we know of nobody better or more experienced than Icahn for that endeavor.

Solomon is an 87-year-old renowned investment banker and Icahn is, well, Icahn and a contemporary of Solomon. However, there is no evidence that the two have ever crossed paths. 

Despite this, we would imagine that they have many relationships in common and mutual respect for each other. While there are many different ways this campaign can go down, what we would like to see is the two elder statesmen meeting in a room with an air of civility and cordiality uncommon in the average activist engagement and together coming up with a board that will oversee management, hold them accountable on behalf of shareholders and usher the company through its first real phase as a truly public company. With Solomon already agreeing to give up control, and neither Solomon nor Icahn likely to be on the continuing board, there is no reason why this should get contentious.

However, we also must address the elephant in the room. Icahn has built his automotive industry on acquisitions, and Monro appears to fit in very nicely in IEP's automotive business. 

Icahn has launched activist campaigns at some of the auto companies that he later went on to acquire, including Pep Boys-Manny Moe and Jack in 2016 and Federal Mogul in 2017. When Icahn acquired Pep Boys he also stated: "We believe that with our abundant resources and knowledge of the industry we will be able to grow this business and take advantage of consolidation opportunities, thereby benefiting customers, manufacturing partners and employees, as well as our shareholders." 

While we sincerely believe that Icahn's main motivation for this investment is to invest in a good company that he believes is at an inflection point and is significantly undervalued, there is always the chance that he might want to own the entire company one day. This is a very small position for him and a good return would not move the needle as much as a synergistic integration into his automative business, but we see no reason why both things cannot be true.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.

In this article

(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)

Berkshire Hathaway's B shares and A shares moved 4.5% higher this week after a strong earnings report last weekend, even as the broader market moved lower amid fears AI stocks are overvalued and worries about weakness for the U.S. economy.

The Nasdaq's 3% drop was its worst weekly decline since April.

The upturn for Berkshire shares has cut its underperformance versus the benchmark S&P 500 to 4.3 percentage points from 12.2 percentage points on October 29.

Operating profits for Berkshire's wholly owned companies were up 34% to almost $13.5 billion in the third quarter, with a 200% increase for insurance underwriting income.

There were again no stock buybacks, a sign Buffett does not think Berkshire shares are significantly undervalued despite their weakness since May.

With no money spent on buying back Berkshire shares and equity sales outpacing purchases, the company's September 30 cash hit $381.7 billion, up 10.9% since the end of June.

If you subtract BNSF's cash and account for the timing of some Treasury bill purchases, the total is $354.3 billion, up 4.3% from June.

Warren Buffett may be delivering his final message as Berkshire's CEO next Monday.

This week the company confirmed in a news release what it told the Wall Street Journal last week.

"On Monday, November 10th, Berkshire will be issuing a press release which will contain a message from Mr. Buffett regarding philanthropy, Berkshire and other matters that Berkshire shareholders and others may find to be of interest."

The philanthropy part will probably be connected to his annual Thanksgiving contributions to family foundations.

The "Berkshire and other matters" portion could be something of a farewell message as he prepares to step down as CEO at the end of the year.

While he will remain chairman of the board, he will not be on stage at next May's meeting and new CEO Greg Abel will be writing the annual letter to shareholders.

Since he appears to be intentionally limiting his future opportunities to speak to shareholders and the rest of the world, Buffett may be ready to have his final say now.

We won't know for sure until next Friday's release of Berkshire's Q3 equity portfolio snapshot, but it looks like there were more sales of Apple shares during the three months ending September 30.

CNBC.com's Yun Li notes Berkshire's 10-Q last Saturday reported a $1.2 billion decline in its cost basis for consumer product stocks, which would include Apple.

She also points out that Apple's 24% gain during the quarter would have provided an opportunity for Buffett to lock in more profits.

Apple remains Berkshire's largest equity holding, currently valued at $75.2 billion, but it has cut the position by 69% over the past two years.

Barron's divides that $1.2 billion cost basis drop by $35, Apple's per-share basis, to estimate Berkshire may have sold 35 million shares for around $8 billion, based on Apple's average price of $230 per share during the quarter.

With Apple reporting in its 10-Q that it had $12.4 billion in Q3 equity sales, Barron's suggests a lot of the remaining $4.4 billion may be Bank of America sales, another big position that Berkshire has been sharply reducing.

That stake has been cut by around 40% since the beginning of last year.

At $32.2 billion, it is Berkshire's third largest equity holding.

Berkshire Hathaway has hired banks to prepare for another yen bond sale, according to Bloomberg and Nikkei.

The company has also filed a preliminary prospectus with the SEC.

It would be the second time this year it has borrowed Japanese yen, a strong indication it plans to keep building its stakes in the "trading house" stocks it has been buying since 2019.

That helped lift four of the five stocks this week, with Itochu's 6.5% gain leading the way.

All five of the stocks are at or near all-time highs.

The combined value of Berkshire's reported holdings is approaching $33 billion, up from $31 billion just one month ago.

The figure could be even higher assuming some of Berkshire's continued buying has not yet been publicly revealed.

Berkshire Hathaway has a new warning about YouTube videos with "images or AI created images impersonating" Warren Buffett.

A news release Thursday said, "Generally, such video images of Mr. Buffett may appear to look like him but the sound of the impersonator speaking in a very flat monotone voice is clearly not the voice of Mr. Buffett."

It added, "Mr. Buffett is concerned that these types of fraudulent videos are becoming a spreading virus. Individuals who are less familiar with Mr. Buffett may believe these videos are real and be misled by the contents of these videos."

In April, a Berkshire release cited unspecified "reports currently circulating on social media" about "comments allegedly made" by Buffett and said, "All such reports are false."

Buffett also warned shareholders at the 2024 Berkshire annual meeting that AI's ability to create fake audio and video could make scamming "the growth industry of all time."

Warren Buffett explains why investors should look at their stocks the same way they would look at owning a farm or an apartment.

WARREN BUFFETT: If you have a temperament that when others are fearful, you're going to get scared yourself, you know, you are not going to make a lot of money in securities over time, in all probability.

You know, people really -- if they didn't look at quotations -- but of course, the whole world is urging them to look at quotations, and more than that, do something based on small changes in quotations.

But think how much more rational -- we've talked about it before -- but think how much more rational investing in a farm is than the way many people buy stocks.

If you buy a farm, do you get a quote next week, do you get a quote next month? If you buy an apartment house, do you get a quote next week or month?

No, you look at the apartment house or the farm, and you say, "I expect it to produce so many bushels of soybeans and corn, and if it does that, it meets my expectations."

If they buy a stock and they think if it goes up it's wonderful, and if it goes down it's bad.

We think just the opposite. When it goes down, we love it, because we'll buy more. And if it goes up, it kills us to buy more.

And I -- you know -- all kinds -- you know, Ben Graham wrote about it. It's been explained. But if you can't get yourself in that mental attitude, you're going to be scared whenever everybody else is scared.

And to expect somebody else to tell you when to buy and therefore get your courage back up or something, you know --

I could get this fellow's courage up substantially by saying this is a wonderful time to buy, and then a week from now he'd run into somebody else that tells him the world is coming to an end and he'd sell.

I mean, he's a broker's friend, but he's not going to make a lot of money.

Beaches, balmy weather, bustling nightlife, and, of course, attractive savings on capital gains taxes.

The day traders of San Juan seem to have it all.

That, at least, is the story that has circulated among young investors, as the number of traders who have relocated to Puerto Rico has surged in recent years. They're drawn by the tax advantages, and the fact that, if you squint, it really just looks like you're on permanent vacation.

But, for traders who have joined the exodus, being happy in Puerto Rico is tougher than it seems at first glance. Many who make the move often say that life isn't quite what they expected, even though they are, after all, saving a lot of money.

Anand Sanghvi, a trader who moved to Puerto Rico around 2018 and now "onboards" others relocating to the island with the help of a sprawling network of lawyers and realtors, says the move has never been more popular.

The number of traders who moved to the island this year under the mentorship of Sanghvi's firm, TradeSpace, has already surpassed 2024's total. Numbers have nearly tripled over the last two years since Sanghvi first came to the island himself, he told Business Insider.

Andrew Gordon, the managing attorney at Gordon Law Group, says he counsels "hundreds" of traders each year about whether they should move to Puerto Rico. The number of traders who made the move about doubled in 2024 compared to the prior year, he estimated.

Sanghvi and Gordon say the allure of moving to the island has only grown in recent years as the stock and crypto markets have soared. Traders who seek their help — many of whom are young men, Gordon says — are often sitting on a mountain of capital gains, which they know will eventually draw a hefty tax bill.

Many also express disdain for US politics and are looking for a change from cities like Miami, Sanghvi said. For those, Puerto Rico is the simplest option, he said, referring to how US citizens don't need to a visa to move there.

The sun and party scene in San Juan, Puerto Rico's capital, are cherries on top.

"They want the nightlife, they want the partying, they want the bars, they want the nice restaurants, they want all that kind of stuff," Sanghvi said. "You got two choices. You got Dubai and you got Puerto Rico. So what are you going to choose? You know what I mean?"

Luke Lintz, a 26-year-old crypto trader who moved to Puerto Rico during the pandemic, said he was sold on the idea when he was preparing taxes for his business in 2020. Lintz jumped on a call with his accounting team to figure out how they could best mitigate the tax hit, and then packed his bags to Puerto Rico a week later.

Lintz, who moved to Puerto Rico with his brothers, says he loves the island. His town, Palmas Del Mar, is "mellow" and allows him to put his head down and focus on business.

"It's being on a permanent vacation," he said. "We're doing a ton of things and a lot of activity, and then being able to come back to a place where really all I want to do is just take good care of my body, get a lot of sunlight, and then work — it's great because there's very little distractions."

Steven Dux, a 31-year-old trader, moved from California to Puerto Rico this spring. His wife had been making the case to move there to reap the tax benefits for years. After a trip to the island, the couple finally relocated to Dorado, a luxury area where a high-end rental can go as high as $100,000 a month. It feels like a movie, Dux says, though he's aware that the town is different from most of the island.

"I think we're happy overall. Of course, there's benefits and there's some sacrifice," he said, adding that the biggest pro was the ability to save tons of money.

There seems to be one big catch to life in Puerto Rico: assimilating is harder for some than others. Sanghvi and Gordon estimate that around half of the traders they know who move to Puerto Rico and find themselves unhappy — or, at least, surprised by what it's like once they arrive.

"There are people unfortunately who come down here and who expect everything to be on the level that it was in the States, and you don't realize this is a whole different world," Sanghvi said. "They continue to kind of bang themselves on their head about this. They get frustrated."

Many traders find it hard to adjust their expectations when it comes to the conveniences they take for granted in the US. There's no such thing as one-day delivery in Puerto Rico, for instance. Lintz said.

Power outages are a common occurrence. For traders, this means having a backup generator is critical, Gordon said.

The majority of the island's food is also imported, which makes finding clean eating options "frustrating," Lintz added.

Puerto Rico's social scene, though, seems to be the biggest issue. It can be hard for a newcomer to meet people, Sanghvi says, depending on whether they already have contacts and how much they're willing to put themselves out there.

Dux said life in his neighborhood could be "very boring" at times, due to the community being small and having little to do.

Lintz said he felt Puerto Rico was cliquish. There are a handful of prominent social networks across the island, he said, with some being more insular than others.

"It's just hard to get to know people because I just don't think there's that many events and opportunities to meet people in person," he said, adding that he and his brothers planned to be more focused on work for the next several years.

Tension between locals and newcomers adds another challenge. The streets of San Juan are filled with graffiti telling recent transplants to go home, Lintz said.

Much of the tension revolves around traders who don't understand the history between Puerto Rico and the United States, Sanghvi said.

"They don't feel comfortable. They don't feel welcome," he said of those traders. "They don't feel like they're fitting in, but they're not doing the things they need to in order to fit in."

Family and relationship issues are also common. Many traders who move with their families find that their wives are bored, Sanghvi said, adding that it was common for married couples to move back to the States.

To Sangvhi, who says he runs into connections everywhere he goes in Puerto Rico, the key to being happy on the island isn't so much a secret as it is a personality and a willingness to step outside one's comfort zone. His advice is straightforward: Learn Spanish, network, and explore the island beyond San Juan.

"Most people who come here, they just sit inside their bubble, and that's it," Sanghvi said. "If you're not a person who is willing to step out of said comfort zone, it's going to be hard for you."

Sanghvi said some traders treat their time on the island like they're in prison. He believes those are traders who haven't properly assimilated into the island's culture and only stay there for the bare minimum — 183 days of the year — to claim the tax benefits and work in peace.

"You talk to them, they're like, 'Yeah, I got to do my days.' I'm like, 'Bro, you're in jail.' I'm on the beach at six in the morning, having a great time," he said. "So this is my world. I don't go anywhere."

If you're a young person trying to land a job in the age of AI, one expert says you should focus on mastering tasks, not skills. 

Wharton professor Ethan Mollick, a prominent figure in the AI revolution and author of "Co-Intelligence," said that a lot of the skills people learn related to AI aren't all that useful, because the technology evolves and quickly makes the skill somewhat irrelevant.

"It would be helpful for young people to think more about what tasks they're actually really good at, because that's where they stay ahead of machines," Mollick told Business Insider. "And then you can find a job where the machine helps you with the other pieces of your task."

Every job, he said, requires many tasks, and it's unlikely that a single applicant will excel at all of them. AI can help with "task distribution" and help in the areas where applicants struggle. Knowing how to provide clear instructions is crucial for maximizing the benefits of AI as it completes tasks.

"Being able to be an expert enough in something to know whether it's good or bad turns out to be really important," Mollick said about judging AI's output.

He also advised that young people should focus on gaining broad knowledge and developing expertise in specific topics. Since AI machines are trained on such a wide array of information, having a strong base in the humanities is useful, he said.

AI is threatening entry-level jobs across industries, making it especially hard for Gen Zers to find work. Mollick — who has consulted with JPMorgan, Google, and the White House on AI usage — told Business Insider that he's most concerned about whether we're tackling the question of how to restructure jobs with enough urgency.

As AI automates some technical abilities, soft skills are newly crucial for job applicants. Communication, leadership, and organizational prowess were among the top skills identified by Indeed's Hiring Lab. Some leaders who celebrate the promise of AI worry that employees could lose the ability to complete certain tasks.

For some diehard Starbucks fans, a $7 latte isn't enough of a splurge — they're ready to spend hundreds of dollars on the collectible holiday cup it comes in.

Starbucks' Glass Bearista Cold Cup, which launched and quickly sold out on Thursday at an original price point of $29.95, has evolved from festive holiday merch into an investment item, fueling a resale market usually reserved for designer sneakers and rare toys.

Shortly after launch, eBay was flooded with listings for the beanie-wearing Bearista, with some cups listed with "Buy It Now" prices of up to $50,000. While it doesn't appear that any have sold for such an exorbitant price, auction listings reviewed by Business Insider have racked up bids upward of $285 (plus shipping).

A representative for Starbucks told Business Insider the response to the Bearista cup "exceeded even our biggest expectations."

"Despite shipping more Bearista cups to coffeehouses than almost any other merchandise item this holiday season, the Bearista cup and some other items sold out fast," the spokesperson said. "We know it's disappointing to fans, and we're sorry if they missed out. We appreciate our customers' understanding. We have more exciting merchandise coming this holiday season."

The holiday spirit at Starbucks came with an extra side of scarcity this year, as some baristas who worked on launch day said their stores received just one or two Bearista cups to sell — and customers were lined up before opening, ready to claim one for themselves.

The Starbucks spokesperson declined to comment on the number of Bearista units shipped out this year or stock levels at specific stores.

A shift supervisor who has been with the company for over a year told Business Insider that customers lined up outside for more than half an hour before the store opened, and since they only received two Bearista cups to sell, they "sold out immediately."

"I got to my store somewhere between 3:45 and 3:50 a.m. and there were already several people literally wrapped in blankets, camped out in front of the store," a Minnesota-based barista who has worked with Starbucks for seven years told Business Insider. "When we tried to enter, after reminding them that the store does not open until 4:30 a.m., they tried to push their way in with us."

She added that, when her manager arrived at the store after 4 a.m. and told the waiting customers there would be a limit of one bear-themed cup per party, the customers got angry and "cussed her out."

The 2025 Bearista cup isn't Starbucks' first foray into collectible merch. The company first debuted its Bearista in 1997 in plush form and has since expanded into a wide variety of seasonal and themed merchandise, which customers regularly clamor for.

A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider that the policy for merchandise sales requires the items to be sold on a first-come, first-served basis, with no purchase limit or holds — meaning customers could buy more than one, and a staff member could not set aside an item with the intent to purchase it themselves, or save it for a customer.

John Kauchick, a 70-year-old Starbucks fan in Mississippi who says he has spent "several thousand" dollars on collectible merchandise from the coffee giant over the last 25 years, told Business Insider he camped outside his local Starbucks starting at 3 a.m. to get a chance at purchasing the bear, as well as some limited-edition Hello Kitty-themed merchandise also released on Thursday.

Although he was first in line, Kauchick said a barista at the location he visited had purchased the store's lone Bearista cup for herself before he had the opportunity to do so, which has irritated him enough to consider stopping his spending at Starbucks entirely.

"I felt cheated out of the opportunity to get one," Kauchick said. Although he has turned to resellers before, including spending $150 on a Taylor Swift-themed Starbucks tumbler he had been eyeing, he doesn't want to keep feeding the secondary market, given the inflated prices.

"I may get one," he said, "But I have this bad taste in my mouth still, and I think I may decide I just can't do this anymore."

In the days since the launch, social media has been filled with celebratory posts from Starbucks fans showcasing their festive Bearista cups.

The fervor is reminiscent of the craze surrounding cult items like Labubu dolls, which Business Insider reported in August were on track to hit a billion dollars in sales this year, and created a secondary market of people creating custom versions, including tattooed Labubus that sell for over $200 each, for the most committed fans of the brand.

For every post bragging about scoring one of the coveted cups, there's another from an exhausted barista, publicly begging customers to understand that they have no personal control over the available inventory.

Once the Bearista cups were sold out at her store, the Minnesota-based barista said some customers became aggressive, calling her and other staff "flat out disgusting" names. The vitriol continued well into Friday, she said.

Another barista, who has worked at the company for 11 years, told Business Insider that "the phone wouldn't stop ringing" all day Thursday, with customers calling to see if their store happened to have an extra Bearista on hand.

"If customers were polite, I would apologize and direct them to the Target store where they might have a slim chance to get one," they said, referencing licensed in-store cafés, which were rumored to have received more Bearista inventory than corporate-owned stores. "If they were rude and asked me if we had any at 5 p.m., I told them they already knew the answer."

Although some social media reports suggested that a handful of Starbucks fans became violent over the Bearista launch, Business Insider could not verify any such incidents. Still, it wouldn't be the first time collectors threw punches over a popular item. In 2021, Target stopped stocking Pokémon, NFL, MLB, and NBA trading cards after their increasing resale value sparked fist fights in their stores.

"I'm a bug for rarity, and one thing that Starbucks does is they build up the expectation or the perception of scarcity — and they do that on purpose," Kauchick said. "I feel sorry for some of the people who got caught up in the hostility or whatever. But, you know, Starbucks knows what they're doing."

In this article

U.S. drugmaker Pfizer has clinched a $10 billion deal for obesity drug developer Metsera, capping a fierce biotech bidding war between the New York-based pharma giant and Danish rival Novo Nordisk Novo Nordisk.

Metsera accepted a sweetened offer from Pfizer late on Friday, citing U.S. antitrust risks in Novo's bid that it had previously called superior. The Danish obesity drug behemoth said on Saturday it would exit the race.

The bidding war win hands Pfizer a way into the lucrative obesity drug market, even if Metsera's treatments remain years from hitting the market. It marks a blow for Novo as it tries to claw back lost ground against U.S. rival Eli Lilly.

Pfizer appeared to have locked up the deal in September before Novo jumped in last week with an unsolicited offer, sparking a fight for a coveted asset in the growing weight-loss market. Pfizer is trying to gain a toehold in obesity to overcome past in-house stumbles in developing weight-loss drugs.

Pfizer has agreed to pay $86.25 per share in cash, a premium of 3.69% to Metsera's Friday close, Metsera said in a statement. The offer includes $65.60 per share in cash and a contingent value right entitling holders to additional payments of up to $20.65 per share in cash.

Novo Nordisk on Saturday said it would not be making an increased offer.

"Following a competitive process and after careful consideration, Novo Nordisk will not increase its offer to acquire Metsera," the Danish drugmaker said in a statement.

Novo added that it is advancing its own pipeline of treatment options for obesity, and that it would "continue to assess opportunities for business development and acquisitions ... that further its strategic objectives."

A source close to Novo said that its last unsuccessful bid had been the "maximum value" of Metsera and that the firm remained confident in its own obesity drug pipeline. The deal was never "do or die" for Novo.

"This was always a bolt-on acquisition for Novo," the person said.

The escalating M&A game sent Metsera's shares surging over the last week. From just before Novo stepped in with its bid through Friday's close, Metsera shares gained nearly 60%, sending its market value to $8.75 billion.

For a time, it appeared Novo had the inside track. Novo has been trying to recover its once-commanding position in obesity drugs that it lost to Eli Lilly.

Metsera, in its Friday statement, said Novo's proposal presented "unacceptably high legal and regulatory risks" compared to the proposed merger with Pfizer, citing a call from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to discuss the risks of a transaction with Novo. The regulator sent a letter earlier this week to Novo and Metsera, saying their proposed deal ran the risk of violating U.S. antitrust laws.

Novo said in its statement that it believed that the structure of its offer was "compliant with antitrust laws".

In a statement, Pfizer said it was pleased to have reached a revised agreement with Metsera, and expects to close the merger soon after Metsera's November 13 shareholder meeting.

Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen said the $10 billion price rested on optimistic assumptions about the future performance of Metsera, saying Pfizer would need to assume $11 billion in revenue by 2040, nearly double Metsera's current projections. She pointed to growing skepticism around long-term GLP-1 pricing, which could compress margins.

Metsera's board recommended that its shareholders approve the amended Pfizer offer. The biotech company currently loses money and analysts expect additional losses while its drugs are still in development.

The bidding war between Pfizer and Novo lifted the price from Pfizer's $7.3 billion offer in September. Former Pfizer research and development chief John LaMattina told Reuters that the battle was reminiscent of Pfizer's 2000 hostile takeover of Warner-Lambert for $90 billion, an effort to gain control of Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering drug.

"While this is a smaller deal, Pfizer must believe that Metsera's pipeline is key for its future," he said.

Analysts and investors have pointed to the unusually fierce fight to gain control of Metsera, whose early-stage obesity treatments remain unproven but could be key in a market that some analysts estimate will reach $150 billion by early next decade.

"This is a Game of Thrones-level of play," Peter Kolchinsky, managing partner at RA Capital, a top-20 Metsera shareholder, said before the final bid was accepted.

Metsera's experimental obesity drugs, MET-097i, a GLP-1 injectable, and MET-233i, which mimics the pancreatic hormone amylin, are projected to reach $5 billion in combined peak sales, according to Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger.

A Manhattan federal judge on Friday declared a mistrial in the case of two MIT-trained brothers accused of fraud for a 12-second transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that netted them $25 million.

The judge ended the trial of James and Anton Peraire-Bueno at 7 p.m. after the jury's five men and seven women pleaded in a lengthy note for deliberations to end, saying the case had become an emotional strain and they could not reach a unanimous verdict.

Half of the jurors "spontaneously broke down in tears" on Thursday, and some jurors had suffered "multiple nights of sleeplessness" during the three days they deliberated, they told the judge in the note.

"We are unanimously of the belief that we are not making any progress," the note concluded.

"There's nothing in the note to indicate that if I hold them over until Monday, that anybody will change the result here," US District Court Judge Jessica G. L. Clarke told the parties before bringing the jury out to send them home, ending the four-week trial.

The verdict is the third failure this year for federal efforts to convict defendants in multimillion-dollar digital asset fraud and money laundering cases. Prosecutors did not immediately say if they will seek to retry the two brothers.

The reprieve — temporary though it may be — left the brothers, their lawyers, and their parents smiling and exchanging embraces in the courtroom.

The final deadlock note was the second time the jury sent a message to the judge on Friday saying they were unable to reach a verdict.

"We all did our best," a male juror told Business Insider, declining to comment further before leaving the courthouse.

Another male juror told a prosecutor that the jury could not agree on how to apply the law.

"There was markedly little debate about the facts," this juror could be heard telling the prosecutor in a post-mistrial conversation outside the courtroom.

"It was understanding the law," the juror said. "Finding the appropriate standard was a struggle for us."

James Peraire-Bueno, 29, and Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, faced three charges — wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and money laundering, each carrying a maximum of 20 years in prison.

To find them guilty of wire fraud, jurors needed to agree that the brothers intentionally made at least one fraudulent misrepresentation to deceive others for the purpose of obtaining money.

Throughout deliberations, jurors repeatedly asked for clarifications and definitions around such key words as "wrongful," "willful," "misrepresentation," and "false pretense."

The brothers were accused of tricking a trio of cryptocurrency traders out of $25 million in a dizzyingly complicated and blindingly fast transaction.

Federal prosecutors described the brothers' 12-second, April 2023 maneuver as a "first of its kind" blockchain heist, but emphasized to the jury that the high-tech money grab was no different from any simpler or less modern fraud.

"There is no separate law about fraud on the blockchain," Assistant US Attorney Danielle Marie Kudla told jurors Tuesday, during closing arguments.

Whether on the phone, online, or on Ethereum, "You can't tell a lie and deceive people to get their money," she added.

Prosecutors said the brothers' fraudulent misrepresentations included their typing a series of invalid zeros, which voided or "poisoned" a block of transactions they were supposed to blindly add to the blockchain.

Poisoning the proposed block let the brothers see and tamper with their victims' trades, prosecutors said.

The defense had countered that the brothers pocketed their small fortune after a fair and square battle: their preprogrammed software, or "bots," simply outsmarted the targets' bots.

In closing arguments, defense lawyer Daniel Nathan Marx told the jury that any rule-bending on the brothers' part was par for the course in the "brutally competitive," bot-eat-bot world of Ethereum.

"They took on risk and enjoyed tremendous success," Marx told jurors. "They should be celebrated, not villainized by the prosecution."

The outcome may help define the Justice Department's evolving role in policing cryptocurrency.

Both sides agreed the Peraire-Bueno's was a first-of-its kind prosecution. The defense went further, saying that the verdict will have an unprecedented impact on the Ethereum blockchain.

Until now, the blockchain has been self-regulating, defense lawyers argued last year, calling the Peraire-Bueno prosecution unwelcome and unneeded.

"The indictment is an audacious attempt by the United States government to regulate, for the first time and through criminal prosecution, the duties and interactions of the Ethereum Network — a decentralized, trustless system that uses economic incentives to drive behavior and relies on consensus to effect changes," they wrote as part of an unsuccessful effort to dismiss the charges.

Prior to this latest outcome, the DOJ suffered two other major losses in federal courts in Manhattan this year.

In May, a federal judge overturned the jury's wire fraud conviction against Avraham "Avi" Eisenberg, who was accused of draining $110 million through a pump-and-dump scheme.

In August, another Manhattan jury could not agree if Tornado Cash CEO Roman Storm laundered $1 billion in dirty crypto.

One notable pre-trial victory came last month, when federal prosecutors in Brooklyn announced the largest forfeiture in department history, seizing $15 billion in bitcoin from the accused mastermind behind an international cryptocurrency investment fraud ring.

Oops, something went wrong

While Bitcoin and Ethereum funds shed assets, Bitwise's fledgling Solana ETF racked up more than $126 million in net inflows in its first full week of trading, an auspicious sign for the SOL-tracking product and potentially for other altcoin funds.

The Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) has generated more than $545 million in net inflows since its October 28 debut on the New York Stock Exchange, including $223 million in seed investments, according to UK asset manager Farside Investments. BSOL's share price closed up 5% in Friday trading.

"Inflows every day for the last 8 days since its launch," crypto asset manager Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsely wrote in an X post early Friday. "Over $500,000,000 in total. It's clear investors want Solana exposure."

Over that period, the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs have lost more than $2.1 billion in assets, while net outflows for the nine Ethereum funds have totaled $579 million. The Bitwise Solana fund's promising start comes even as SOL's price has been dropping, part of a market-wide downturn tied to a government shutdown and other macroeconomic uncertainties.

Solana was recently trading at $156, off more than 16% for the past week and nearly 29% over the last month, according to crypto markets data provider CoinGecko. Bitcoin has declined about 16% since early October when it rose to a record high above $126,000.

A Myriad prediction market found that only 13% of respondents expect Solana to surpass its record high of $293 by year's end. Myriad is a unit of Dastan, the parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt. 

In a text to Decrypt, etf.com Senior Analyst Sumit Roy wrote "the (Solana) inflows make sense," noting the token's massive $90 billion market value: "Solana has a devoted following, arguably the most devoted following after Bitcoin and Ethereum."

He added: "It wouldn't be surprising to see Solana ETFs collectively account for 5% of that market cap at the very least. So in that context, $500M is still small. The fact that BSOL launched with 100% staking certainly made it more attractive as well."

The listing of the Bitwise fund and a Grayscale Solana ETF last week surprised some hopeful observers, who had feared the current government shutdown would delay a regulatory process that had already taken months.

But the NYSE certified 8-A filings that offered the fund managers an alternative route to the recent ETF approval process. Issuers file these forms with the SEC to register certain securities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The funds met the generic listing standards adopted by the SEC in September for commodity-based trusts. The Grayscale Solana Trust ETF (GSOL) has received about $114 million in net inflows, most of them in seed investments.

Bitcoin Dips Below $100K in 'Mid-Cycle Shakeout' Amid Bond Market Volatility

Last week, spot Litecoin and Hedera funds from Canary began trading after the Nasdaq certified their 8-A submissions. Other altcoin-focused funds benefiting from the same SEC rule change may soon also be available to investors.

In a Thursday filing to the agency, Bitwise removed a "delaying amendment" from its S-1 prospectus for the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF. The fund could begin trading in a few as 20 days from the submission if the SEC doesn't object.

"Looks like Bitwise is doing the 8(a) move for their spot Dogecoin ETF, which basically means they plan on going effective in 20 days barring an intervention," Eric Balchunas wrote in an X post on Thursday.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Donald Trump was elected president again one year ago this week, though some of the crypto industry's lobbyists quietly say they feel like they've aged many years in this tumultuous 12 months, which saw a range of lofty highs and deep frustrations in the young sector's hunt for U.S. policies.



President Trump surged back into the White House with wide support from crypto voters and optimism from many of the most prominent U.S. leaders of the industry that he'd secure their place in the U.S. financial system. In many ways, that faith in the politician has paid off.



He quickly issued executive orders demanding progress on friendly crypto policies and the establishment of a bitcoin BTC$102,126.31 reserve to stash the government's holdings as a long-term investment.



"Since day one he has issued executive orders and moved for agencies to pay attention to digital assets and how blockchain can increase transparency across the government," said Cody Carbone, CEO of the Digital Chamber, in a statement to CoinDesk.



In Congress, the industry shifted from pariah of 2022 (during its struggles with failing firms and fraud prosecutions) to a top priority of 2025, with significant support from a president who made continual demands of allied lawmakers. In a stunning example of rapid, bipartisan legislating, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) Act became law, the first major U.S. crypto policy effort to do so.



The Trump administration's Treasury Department and banking agencies have already begun trying to sort out its implementation — a lengthy process as it winds its way through public-comment periods and eventually through multiple rule proposals.



The GENIUS Act was meant as a companion to advance alongside the more important legislation that would set up rules of the road for U.S. crypto markets beyond the stablecoin issuers. While that effort again passed in the House of Representatives this year, the Senate hasn't yet acted.



As he continues goading Congress, Trump has made some consequential appointments to run the U.S. financial regulators. At the top of that list for crypto advocates is Paul Atkins, who was confirmed to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins is a crypto supporter who made friendly new policies his top priority at the agency. He's lately promised concrete rule proposals in the coming months.



Trump also installed Jonathan Gould, a former crypto lawyer, atop the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.



"The past year has delivered what many thought impossible: a complete reversal of federal crypto policy, transforming America from a jurisdiction defined by regulation-by-enforcement to one that's racing to lead the global digital economy," said Kristin Smith, president of the Solana Policy Institute.



On the flip side of his administration's crypto progress, Trump's volatile leadership has potentially threatened other parts of the agenda. The current, prolonged shutdown of the federal government — the longest-ever, beating the record set during Trump's first term — has contributed to a derailing of the Senate's legislative work, including the single most important U.S. policy aim for crypto: the market structure bill.



Polling has consistently shown voters blame Trump and Republican lawmakers more for the shutdown than Democrats. The budget impasse not only redirects lawmakers' energies toward settling that dispute, but it also has furloughed federal workers who are meant to focus on helping write the legislation.



Even without closing down government operations, the legislative negotiations were at a precarious point, with some Republicans balking at the idea the Senate's version of the House's Digital Asset Market Clarity Act was ready to advance. Some crypto lobbyists have privately shifted their expectations as far as 2027 before Congress will finish that job, because next year's midterm elections would be expected to turn Capitol Hill into a political battlefield in which bipartisan action could become difficult.



The shuttered doors of government have also stalled the industry's pursuit of product approvals and public-offering pursuits that need sign-off from the SEC.



And despite Trump's orders to set up crypto reserves at the federal level, that project hasn't gone anywhere past the planning stage. Those working on it have suggested congressional action may be needed to clear the final hurdle to establish the funds. Like other legislative efforts beyond the market-structure push — such as overhauling the tax code for crypto activity — this one could be waiting in line for a while.



Meanwhile, though the crypto industry has lined up a long list of allies among Democratic lawmakers, Trump has drawn sharp criticism from members of the opposition party for his personal stake in digital assets businesses. There are few corners of the sector his and his family's interest don't touch, and the potential conflicts of interest for the president came to a head when the biggest holders of his memecoin were invited to a private evening event with him.



Many of the top investors in Trump's coin were foreign nationals, and the administration declined to identify those attending the dinner and rubbing elbows with the president.



Also, Trump's successes in appointing regulators, such as at the SEC, OCC and in slowly remaking the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, have been countered somewhat by challenges, such as his having to withdraw his first choice as chairman for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.



Most of the prominent leaders of the industry have become cozy with Trump, and White House crypto events have seen CEOs and founders — such as the chiefs of Coinbase, Ripple, Tether and Gemini — eagerly participating in the president's celebrations. But while that relationship has strengthened, the president's public popularity has fallen. In this opening year of his second administration, Trump's approval ratings have declined rapidly to plumb depths not touched by other recent presidents, with 58% disapproving of the job he's doing — especially the younger voters who had been relatively enthusiastic about giving him a return to the White House.



As this week saw a number of state-level elections considered potential bellwethers for the congressional midterms a year from now, the voting public's feelings about Trump's presidency were on potential display. One year after reelecting Trump, they rebounded dramatically toward supporting Democratic candidates. If that holds for the 2026 midterms, Democrats could make gains in Congress and possibly retake the House majority, ending the lock Republicans hold across the executive and legislative branches of government.



If that takes place on Trump's watch, his crypto agenda may have to adjust to a more overtly bipartisan cooperation during his final two years in office. But Trump's opening year has already provided more policy progress than the industry had ever achieved before, and advocates say it's having significant results on U.S. businesses.

"We've seen digital asset companies reshore operations, expand their presence and grow headcounts as a result of President Trump and a pro-crypto Congress," said Summer Mersinger, the CEO of the Blockchain Association who was a recent U.S. commodities regulator in this administration.

 Weak demand from spot Ethereum ETFs, soft derivatives data, and macro fears have left Ether struggling to sustain $3,400 despite signs of steady onchain activity. 

Key takeaways:

Ethereum ETF outflows and cautious traders show limited confidence in ETH price going higher for now. 

Low derivatives premiums suggest a muted outlook for Ether's price.

Ether (ETH) fell 11% over the past week, even after reaching the $3,400 mark on Saturday. The drop came alongside a 4% correction in the Nasdaq index, which erased gains from the previous two weeks. Traders are now debating whether ETH still has chances to reclaim the $3,900 level.

Concerns about global economic growth surfaced after weak quarterly results from consumer-focused companies and renewed worries over high valuations in the artificial intelligence sector. Meanwhile, the longest-ever US government shutdown continues to hurt the economy.

Ether futures are trading at a 4% premium to spot markets, unchanged from the previous week. The data shows a limited appetite for bullish positions, although it has not yet approached panic levels below 0%. 

Under normal market conditions, this premium typically sits between 5% and 10% to account for the longer settlement period.

Market anxiety grew after US consumer sentiment expectations plunged to their lowest levels ever, according to a University of Michigan survey. 

November's reading, released Friday, was the second weakest since at least 1978 and was largely blamed on the ongoing US government spending shutdown, AP reported.

Part of Ether investors' frustration stems from ETH 4% weekly underperformance compared to the broader crypto market. This suggests that, beyond rising macroeconomic risks, other factors have likely made traders more cautious toward Ethereum.

The total value locked on the Ethereum network fell to $74 billion—the lowest since July—marking a 24% drop over the past 30 days. Investors were caught off guard after one of Ethereum's leading decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, Balancer v2, was hit by a $120 million exploit on Monday.

Ethereum decentralized applications (DApps) generated $80.7 million in revenue in October, an 18% decline from September. The decrease is particularly concerning for ETH holders, as lower onchain activity puts downward pressure on the native staking yield. 

Ethereum's design includes a mechanism that burns ETH during periods of high demand for blockchain data processing, helping balance network activity and supply.

However, the first week of November shows early signs of strength for Ethereum compared with rival blockchains. Active addresses climbed 5% over the past seven days, while transactions rose 2%. By contrast, both Tron and BNB Chain saw declines in onchain activity.

ETH trader sentiment has been weighed down by the lack of demand for Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). US-listed products recorded $507 million in net outflows during November, and there were no notable ETH corporate reserve purchases, according to Strategic ETH Reserve data.

Currently, ETH's only clear catalyst is the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, slated for early December. The update is designed to deliver several scalability and security enhancements to the network. 

However, with derivatives markets signaling weakness and investors wary of a slowing global economy, the chances of a breakout toward $3,900 in the short term appear limited.

The Director of the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, Xu Zhengyu, believes that AI, blockchain and tokenization are the future of Hong Kong's fintech industry, as the Chinese special administrative region (SAR) celebrates a decade of steady growth in its FinTech ecosystem. 

The Director of the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, Xu Zhengyu, said that Hong Kong's FinTech ecosystem has grown considerably in both size and quality in the ten years since the establishment of Hong Kong's Financial Technology Week. 

Speaking to the media after attending a morning radio program on November 8, Xu said the number of startups in Hong Kong has tripled over the past decade, rising from about 1,600 ten years ago to nearly 5,000 today.

Xu also pointed out that the number of FinTech firms has reached around 1,200, representing a consistent year-on-year growth. 

“These are quantitative changes,” he said, “but we can also see qualitative changes as the ecosystem becomes richer and more mature.”

Xu gave credit to the Hong Kong government's initiatives, saying that they supported this FinTech growth. The authorities issued two major declarations on electronic and digital assets, and one declaration on artificial intelligence, encouraging rapid responses and strong participation from the private sector.

According to Xu, the current phase of FinTech development in Hong Kong is being shaped by artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and tokenization. 

He explained that many companies and financial institutions are now looking for ways to use these technologies in traditional financial products. For example, tokenization brings in steady income streams from things like electric charging stations or property leases that can be turned into investment products. 

“There are also pilot projects that look at how to turn long-term rental income into secure and authentic investment opportunities using blockchain,” Xu said. “These are very concrete examples showing how FinTech is being implemented in real-world scenarios.”

Xu stated that the future will likely be filled with more companies that are finding innovative ways to apply emerging technologies to financial services. He believes the adoption of AI, blockchain, and tokenized assets will not only make markets more efficient but also create new opportunities for both investors and businesses.

During his conversation with the media, the 2023 JPEX cryptocurrency case, in which the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) accused JPEX of operating without a license and misleading investors, came up. 

The platform allegedly promised unusually high returns on digital asset products, which attracted thousands of local investors. Then, withdrawals were suddenly restricted, and many users found they could not access their funds. This incident led to losses exceeding HK$1.5 billion (about US$190 million).

It has been described as Hong Kong's largest financial fraud involving virtual assets. Following the scandal, police made multiple arrests connected to the platform, including the influencers who had promoted JPEX. 

Xu was asked about the case's implications for investors. He started by acknowledging that the rapid growth of FinTech also brings challenges. He noted that there is often a gap in public understanding of new technologies and financial products, which can lead to confusion or misuse.

“Whether it is daily investor education or the rollout of new financial products, there will always be differences in understanding across the market,” he said. “That is why we must continue to strengthen education and awareness among investors.”

 Long-term whales have cashed out millions of dollars from Bitcoin throughout 2025, potentially putting BTC price recovery at risk. 

Key takeaways:

Older Bitcoin whales are selling heavily, spending over 1,000 BTC/hour in 2025.

Bitcoin's bear pennant pattern projects a potential drop to $89,600. 

Bitcoin (BTC) was at risk of further losses as the oldest whales continued to spend their BTC stash. 

Capriole Investments co-founder Charles Edwards said that “super whales are cashing out of Bitcoin,” in a post on X, raising concerns about the potential impact on BTC's price.

The BTC/USD pair trades 18.7% below its all-time high of $126,000 reached on Oct. 6, a drawdown that has been partly attributed to large outflows from old whale wallets. 

While some view this as a normal dip for bull cycles, others argue that the correction has been fueled by selling from long-term holders.

Edwards shared a chart illustrating the extent of onchain spending from “OG” Bitcoin holders—those who have held their assets for seven years or more.

The chart features two color-coded categories: orange for $100 million dumps and red for $500 million dumps, clearly demonstrating the scale of selling by these long-term investors. This selling began in November 2024 and intensified in 2025.

“The chart is VERY colorful in 2025,” Edwards said, adding:

Additional data from Glassnode shows that events where these whales have been spending more than 1,000 BTC per hour have been persistent since January. 

One such example is “Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden,” highlighted by onchain analytics platform Lookonchain. This whale has moved 3,600 BTC, worth about $372 million, on Saturday, with “500 $BTC($51.68) already deposited to Kraken.”

Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden keeps dumping $BTC!Today, he moved 3,600.55 $BTC($372M) — with 500 $BTC($51.68M) already deposited to #Kraken, and the remaining 3,100.55 $BTC ($320.46M) likely heading there in the coming days.https://t.co/sGMrheaZl9https://t.co/lGpGzZiXmE pic.twitter.com/dsZzCKyvc5

Despite this selling pressure, the market has exhibited unusual resilience, according to Willy Woo, who argues that “what constitutes an ‘OG dump' is simply BTC moving out of an address that has been untouched for 7 years.”

Willy Woo suggested that BTC transfers by long-term holders may be intended for moving to taproot addresses for quantum-safe transactions. He notes that these could also involve custody rotations or seeding BTC treasury companies, rather than actual sales.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows BTC trading inside a bear pennant, suggesting that a significant downward move may be next.

A bear pennant is a downward continuation pattern that occurs after a significant drop, followed by a consolidation period at the lower end of the price range.

A break below the pennant's support line at $100,650 could potentially lead to the next leg down for Bitcoin, measured at $89,600 or a 12% decline from its current price level.

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin must close the week above the 50-week EMA, currently at $100,900, to avoid a deeper correction toward $92,000 or lower.

Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade will activate on the blockchain's mainnet on December 3, according to the Ethereum Foundation.

The goal? To enable Ethereum to handle the large transaction traffic from its layer 2 chains, blockchains with a $47 billion on-chain economy built on top of Ethereum. Those chains inherit the base layer's security architecture while offering faster and cheaper transactions.

“Fusaka's biggest impact comes from improvements to data availability through PeerDAS, which should make rollups cheaper and more scalable,” Nick Johnson, founder and lead developer of Ethereum Naming Service, ENS, told DL News.

Fusaka is the latest checkpoint in Ethereum's development plan. Developers are attempting to scale the $410 billion blockchain so that it can handle 100,000 transactions per second, a massive increase from its current maximum of 30 transactions per second. It follows the Pectra upgrade that the developers released in May.

PeerDAS is one of 12 changes to the blockchain included in the Fusaka upgrade package. It targets the data load needed for verifying transactions from layer 2 blockchains.

Layer 2 chains bundle thousands of transactions and submit summaries, called blobs, to the Ethereum base layer. Nodes running on the base layer currently have to download the entire blob data to check for validity.

That process becomes more expensive for nodes as layer 2 transactions soar. It also creates a data traffic jam on the base layer.

PeerDAS solves the problem by reducing the data load for nodes when verifying layer 2 transactions. Instead of downloading the whole blob, nodes only need to check random samples within the blob data to verify transactions.

Leo Fan, co-founder of Cysic, a zero-knowledge-based blockchain, describes Fusaka as a “deep infrastructural shift” for Ethereum, which could increase the chain's throughput eightfold.

The reduced data load could result in a significant reduction in bandwidth costs for nodes. Experts like Shiv Shankar, CEO of Boundless, a zero-knowledge scalability protocol, said that this could help improve Ethereum's efficiency.

“It lets Ethereum handle more activity, which is good for developers building apps,” Shankar told DL News.

However, Fusaka doesn't aim to supercharge Ethereum's layer 2 chains alone. It also includes improvements that directly impact the base layer.

The 12 EIPs include two upgrades that directly aim to stretch the base layer's block and data limits. EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals, are blueprints vetted by Ethereum developers that codify changes to the blockchain.

These upgrades allow for more transaction processing capacity and increase the number of blobs that layer 2 chains can submit to the main chain.

All transactions would “eventually” run on blockchain rails, according to Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters.

“Our belief, which I think is shared by the leadership of Hong Kong, is that pretty much all transactions will settle on blockchains eventually, and that all money will be digital,” Winters said Monday at Hong Kong FinTech Week. “Think about what that means: a complete rewiring of the financial system.”

Winters added that it was not yet clear how this rewiring would be done, which made experimentation supported in Hong Kong all the more critical.

Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen

Hong Kong has worked to become a blockchain and cryptocurrency hub since at least 2022. In 2024, the region launched a tokenization sandbox, which has seen participation from Standard Chartered. This year, the region has also passed a stablecoin bill, offering guidance and clarity to prospective issuers.

Standard Chartered in February announced a partnership with cryptocurrency-focused venture capital firm Animoca Brands to launch a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin.

Winters on Monday said HKD-backed stablecoins could play an “interesting” role in international trade, as they are linked to the Chinese government but are still “tightly managed against the U.S. dollar.”

Meanwhile, Hong Kong is not the only region opening its doors to tokenization and stablecoins. In April, the U.S. enacted stablecoin rules. Meanwhile, the country's Securities and Exchange Commission has unveiled “Project Crypto,” an initiative to enable financial markets to move on-chain.

Amid the global regulatory tilt, several leaders in finance have shown rising optimism about the blockchain sectors.

Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) CEO Vlad Tenev last month likened tokenization to a “freight train,” adding that “it can't be stopped and eventually it's going to eat the entire financial system.”

Cardsmiths' New Currency Cards Include Over $500K in Real Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum

collectibles

After multiple collectors pulled Bitcoin redemption cards from previous sets, trading card manufacturer Cardsmiths released its latest Currency Series set with five cards that are redeemable for 1 full Bitcoin apiece—more than $100,000 each as of this writing.

Currency Series 5 went up for sale on the firm's website and via select retailers on Wednesday, offering its largest-ever selection of crypto redemption cards, which allow collectors to redeem real amounts of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. 

“Demand for Currency Series 5 has exceeded all prior releases. Interest has been both broader and deeper than with any previous Currency set,” Cardsmiths CEO Steven Loney told Decrypt.

The latest series of cards can be purchased for as little as $37 for a box containing two packs, with each pack containing 5 trading cards. Cards redeemable for crypto can be found in approximately 1 of every 96 packs according to data shared on the product page.

Beyond enhancing its redeemables, Cardsmiths also added a non-redeemable 1/1 Bitcoin trading card to Currency Series 5 to stand as a premier collectible from the set. 

The manufacturer also worked with artists like Gunship Revolution Studios, Jon McTavish, and noted street artist Mr. Brainwash to add a distinctive visual presence to the cards. 

“From the beginning, our goal was to create truly unique 'One of One' cards for each Currency release. Bitcoin remains the most recognized and valuable cryptocurrency, so it was a natural choice for this concept,” Loney said.

Collectors have been cashing in on Cardsmiths' currency redemption offerings over the last year, turning packs worth around $30 into over $100,000 thanks to Bitcoin's rise. 

In February, a user found a full Bitcoin redemption card from a $50 pack of the Holiday Currency set, netting them more than six figures in profits if they opted to sell after redemption. 

In August, a GameStop patron found a Bitcoin redemption card that was valued around $115,000 at the time from a pack that cost around $13. Other GameStop customers have shared similar stories thanks to the video game retailer turned collectible firm offering Cardsmiths' products.

Supplies of Currency Series 5 are still available on the manufacturer's website as of Friday afternoon. The firm has partnered with BitPay to allow users to pay with coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Circle's dollar-backed stablecoin, USDC. 

As for Cardsmiths' future crypto ambitions, collectors can expect more Currency sets ahead.

“Currency is our tentpole IP, and development on future sets, including Currency Series 6, is already underway,” said Loney. “We have a good handful of exciting launches on the horizon.”

Cardsmiths' New Currency Cards Include Over $500K in Real Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum

collectibles

After multiple collectors pulled Bitcoin redemption cards from previous sets, trading card manufacturer Cardsmiths released its latest Currency Series set with five cards that are redeemable for 1 full Bitcoin apiece—more than $100,000 each as of this writing.

Currency Series 5 went up for sale on the firm's website and via select retailers on Wednesday, offering its largest-ever selection of crypto redemption cards, which allow collectors to redeem real amounts of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. 

“Demand for Currency Series 5 has exceeded all prior releases. Interest has been both broader and deeper than with any previous Currency set,” Cardsmiths CEO Steven Loney told Decrypt.

The latest series of cards can be purchased for as little as $37 for a box containing two packs, with each pack containing 5 trading cards. Cards redeemable for crypto can be found in approximately 1 of every 96 packs according to data shared on the product page.

Beyond enhancing its redeemables, Cardsmiths also added a non-redeemable 1/1 Bitcoin trading card to Currency Series 5 to stand as a premier collectible from the set. 

The manufacturer also worked with artists like Gunship Revolution Studios, Jon McTavish, and noted street artist Mr. Brainwash to add a distinctive visual presence to the cards. 

“From the beginning, our goal was to create truly unique 'One of One' cards for each Currency release. Bitcoin remains the most recognized and valuable cryptocurrency, so it was a natural choice for this concept,” Loney said.

Collectors have been cashing in on Cardsmiths' currency redemption offerings over the last year, turning packs worth around $30 into over $100,000 thanks to Bitcoin's rise. 

In February, a user found a full Bitcoin redemption card from a $50 pack of the Holiday Currency set, netting them more than six figures in profits if they opted to sell after redemption. 

In August, a GameStop patron found a Bitcoin redemption card that was valued around $115,000 at the time from a pack that cost around $13. Other GameStop customers have shared similar stories thanks to the video game retailer turned collectible firm offering Cardsmiths' products.

Supplies of Currency Series 5 are still available on the manufacturer's website as of Friday afternoon. The firm has partnered with BitPay to allow users to pay with coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Circle's dollar-backed stablecoin, USDC. 

As for Cardsmiths' future crypto ambitions, collectors can expect more Currency sets ahead.

“Currency is our tentpole IP, and development on future sets, including Currency Series 6, is already underway,” said Loney. “We have a good handful of exciting launches on the horizon.”

Chainalysis research has found that stablecoins are replacing Bitcoin as the preferred digital currency to run money laundering schemes. The crypto analytics firm claimed that these fiat-pegged tokens were used in nearly 63% of money laundering transactions in 2024.

The Chainalysis report asserted that stablecoins are mostly preferred because they are easy to send overseas. They can also be traded informally without identity verifications. The report says stablecoins are the new “back accounts” for criminal organizations. 

A “back account” is the final drop account from which the funds transferred across several accounts are withdrawn. The first account where deceived victims deposit their money is referred to as the “front account.”

The report claims that, until 2021, Bitcoin was used almost exclusively for various money laundering crimes; however, stablecoins have recently become more untraceable, especially across borders. The growth of stablecoins has also led to a corresponding increase in their illegal use.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) reported in June that the use of stablecoin by criminals has increased significantly since last year. The FATF also claimed that the majority of illicit activities on blockchains involve stablecoins.  

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) also published a report in January claiming Tether (USDT) was the most popular currency for criminal gangs in Southeast Asia. The main reason stablecoins were used for laundering proceeds from criminal activities is their versatility. The UNODC noted the difficulty in smuggling fiat currencies overseas; converting them in Korea is even more challenging. 

The Chainalysis report also found that converting criminal proceeds into stablecoins allows for easy cross-border remittance. Money launderers can bypass exchanges by using overseas crypto exchanges that don't require KYC (know your customer) verification. They can also use OTC (over-the-counter) transactions.

The report noted that while stablecoins are fundamentally traceable, their decentralized nature allows them to avoid government control.  It further noted that although the transactions may leave a trail, crypto wallets make tracking difficult because they use randomized alphanumeric characters. Tumbled or mixed stablecoins become even more challenging to track.  

The report also found that Korean criminals are increasingly turning to stablecoins for the so-called “Oda Jangip fraud”. The scam begins with false advertising on online shopping stores or second-hand marketplaces, and then money is scammed from unsuspecting buyers. 

Stablecoins are used to launder proceeds from small-scale frauds (hundreds of thousands of dollars) and large-scale scams (hundreds of millions of dollars and more).

However, the report suggests that criminals involved in stablecoin-related crimes often receive lenient sentences. Chainalysis gave an example of one criminal who laundered over $188 million while working for a voice phishing ring in January. The criminal, whom the analytics firm chose to call Person A, bought Ethereum and transferred it to an overseas crypto exchange. 

The ETH was then swapped for USDT and transferred to a crypto wallet controlled by the ring. The money laundering process began with domestic bank accounts, ETH, overseas crypto exchanges, stablecoins, and then a crypto wallet. However, the criminal received only one year and six months in prison, suspended for three years in August. 

Another criminal was reportedly sentenced to eight months in prison and two years' probation for deceiving a victim who bought perfume through a second-hand marketplace. The criminal received the customer's 220,000 won deposit through a fake bank account, and then exchanged it for USDT to cash out.  

The report noted that financial fraud organizations that use stablecoins primarily use tactics such as voice phishing, stock/coin “leading room” scams, and second-hand market fraud. They then seek ways to launder the proceeds cleanly and withdraw them as cash.

XRP reclaims $2.30 amid Nasdaq CEO's claim that blockchain could unlock trillions in trapped capital.

XRP is showing signs of renewed strength after reclaiming $2.30, with major support levels in place, signaling potential for an imminent upward breakout, according to on-chain analytics from VOGs.

XRP has spent the past few weeks consolidating in a tight range, building trader confidence and signaling stability. With rising institutional interest, this steady accumulation sets the stage for a potential breakout, echoing patterns that have historically preceded major crypto rallies.

VOGs identifies $3.50 as a key target for XRP, suggesting that a breakout above this level could signal a new upward trend. 

Notably, XRP is trading around $2.31, drawing keen attention from both retail and institutional investors. With momentum building, a push toward $3.50 may be just around the corner.

At the recent Ripple Swell conference, Nasdaq CEO Diana delivered a compelling message about the transformative power of blockchain in modern finance. 

“Trillions in capital are trapped, blockchain can set it free,” she stated, drawing attention to inefficiencies in the current financial system.





Diana emphasized that the existing financial plumbing, the behind-the-scenes infrastructure that moves money globally, is slow, fragmented, and laden with intermediaries. 

From cross-border transactions to corporate treasury operations, the process is often bogged down by delays, fees, and a lack of transparency. According to her, this results in enormous amounts of capital effectively “locked up,” unable to flow freely to areas where it could generate economic value.

“The challenge isn't a lack of capital,” Diana explained, “it's how that capital moves through the system. There's just so much trapped, waiting to be utilized more efficiently.” She argued that by leveraging blockchain technology, financial institutions could streamline these processes, reduce intermediaries, and increase liquidity.

Blockchain's inherent features, decentralization, transparency, and real-time settlement, allow for more direct movement of assets across borders and institutions. This could potentially unlock trillions of dollars currently tied up in slow or opaque processes. 

For businesses and investors, the implications are significant: faster payments, lower costs, and more efficient capital allocation could drive growth and innovation across industries.

Diana also highlighted Ripple's role in pioneering blockchain solutions for financial institutions, noting that scalable blockchain networks could provide the infrastructure necessary for global capital mobility. 

By implementing digital assets and blockchain-based settlement systems, banks and corporations could access liquidity in ways previously thought impossible, bringing a new level of efficiency to global finance.

The Nasdaq CEO's comments underscore a growing consensus in the financial world: blockchain is not just a speculative tool but a foundational technology capable of reshaping capital flows. If implemented thoughtfully, it could release trapped capital, empower businesses, and redefine how value moves around the world.

As Diana concluded, “If we do it right, we can actually deliver more capital to the system.” 

Her remarks signal a pivotal moment for both traditional finance and the blockchain ecosystem, pointing to a future where money moves faster, smarter, and more transparently than ever before.

Trading near $2.30 with solid support and rising ETF speculation, XRP is poised for a potential breakout toward $3.50. Strong technicals, growing institutional interest, and market accumulation signal that its next move could set the tone for the months ahead, making it a focal point for bullish investors.

At Ripple Swell, Fredman emphasizes a pivotal moment for global finance. Blockchain can unlock trillions in trapped capital, boost liquidity, and drive faster economic growth by addressing the inefficiencies of traditional systems. 

Beyond speed and transparency, it has the power to reshape how money moves, creating a more efficient, inclusive, and dynamic financial ecosystem. Thoughtful implementation could transform not just transactions, but the very flow of global capital.

After weeks of steady decline, Ethereum is finally showing some strength, bouncing back near the $3,460 level. But not everyone is convinced the worst is over. Prominent crypto analyst Ted warns that this sudden recovery might be a “false signal,” suggesting that Ethereum could face one more big drop before a real rebound begins.

Here's how low the ETH price can go.

Short Squeeze or Real Reversal?

While Ethereum's recent 5% daily jump has given traders a brief sense of relief, crypto analyst Ted suggests that this move is likely driven by short liquidations rather than real buying interest. 

He noted that many traders who bet against Ethereum have been forced to close their positions, creating a quick price push that looks like a rally but lacks strong market support.

And the numbers back it up, over $133.83 million worth of ETH positions were liquidated, wiping out both over-leveraged longs and shorts, temporarily boosting prices. But Ted warns that this is a common trap, a short-term bounce before another drop.

Ethereum Price To Drop To $2800 Level

Despite the temporary bounce, the trader insists that Ethereum's market structure still looks heavy. In his view, the earlier drop wasn't the final one, just a pause before the “real move” down. 

His chart highlights strong resistance zones between $3,700 and $3,800, where Ethereum has repeatedly failed to break higher. Until these levels flip into support, the market remains under bearish pressure.

But for now, Ted expects another potential drop toward the $2,900–$3,200 zone, which has acted as a key support area before. 

If that level breaks, Ethereum could slide even further, possibly to around $2,800, before finding solid ground.

Key Level to Watch: $3200

For now, Ted is watching the $3,200 mark closely. Holding above it could give Ethereum's bulls a chance to rebuild momentum. But if it slips below, another wave of selling could follow.

As of now, ETH is trading around $3446, reflecting a 5.2% jump seen in the last 24 hours

Solana price predictions gain traction as DeFi and NFT growth fuel optimism for a $250 breakout. Analysts see SOL's strong momentum continuing, while Remittix (RTX) emerges as a promising payments token challenger.

The Solana price narrative is heating up as DeFi and NFT data indicate the network may be poised for a breakout, while many Layer-1 rivals fall behind. Analysts believe SOL could push towards $250, particularly if usage metrics continue to climb and technical levels are cleared. 

Meanwhile, payments infrastructure token Remittix (RTX) is quietly carving out a high-utility niche that could drive a bigger breakout than Solana.



Usage metrics for Solana are eye-catching. The network processed over 70 million daily transactions and recorded roughly $143 billion in DEX volume for October 2025. This surpasses many rivals. 

At the same time, Solana's architecture gives it the raw speed to capitalize on DeFi demands. It offers a single-layer throughput of 1,100 TPS and a robust validator structure. This means the Solana price story is not just speculative.

Solana is backed by real network activity. If the growing on-chain engagement sustains, the odds that the Solana price could push toward $250 improve significantly.

On the technical front, SOL is at a make-or-break point. The 200-day simple moving average (SMA) around $179–$190 recently failed to hold its position. This signals a temporary structural challenge.  However, underpinned by usage strength, the Solana price remains within an ascending bias in mid-term charts.

Analysts caution that slipping below $138 or $120 could lead to further losses. However, Ted Pillows notes that SOL has cleared almost all downside liquidity. Yet, a strong upward move depends on BTC's recovery.

If buying volume returns and Bitcoin recovers, the Solana price could target $220 in the short term and $250 in the medium term. Solana price is currently $157.



While Solana shows DeFi and NFT growth, Remittix (RTX) is tackling real-world payments, a narrative that could create 2025's biggest breakout. It's offering quick, transparent, and private cross-border payments. Remittix supports over 30 countries and 40 digital assets. It has CertiK-verified smart contracts and is running an active $250,000 Gleam giveaway. Early adopters are already testing key features as the Beta wallet is now live in testing.

The project has already raised $28 million in private funding and confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, drawing attention from both institutional and retail investors. Analysts say its strong fundamentals and expanding PayFi ecosystem could make RTX one of the best-performing digital assets in 2025.

                              November 08, 2025                            

ISLAMABAD: Pakistanis are estimated to have invested $20-30 billion in asset-backed crypto instruments, experts told the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) Conference on Friday, The News reported. 

They projected that crypto trading by Pakistanis could reach $300 billion — a figure approaching the country's approximately $400 billion in GDP.

The experts stressed these figures are indicative only, given the absence of a legal framework to regulate or document crypto activity, which leaves the true scale unverified. 

They warned Pakistan risks forfeiting $25 billion in economic opportunities if it delays regulating cryptocurrencies and virtual assets, urging a swift but cautious approach to avoid falling behind in global adoption.

They cautioned that weak regulations and cybersecurity risks could hinder progress. Both local and international experts at the conference urged the government to adopt a cautious, phased approach toward legalising cryptocurrency. Experts also recommended that Pakistan introduce a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as a first step, saying it could significantly reduce the costs associated with remittances from overseas.

Pakistan Banks Association (PBA) President Zafar Masud noted that the country had the potential to tap $20-25 billion in crypto-related opportunities but stressed the need for proper alignment and regulatory safeguards. He emphasised prioritising consumer protection and suggested that Pakistan introduce stablecoins in the initial phase.

Zafar Masud said the event marked “the first kind of public discussion in Pakistan” on the subject, emphasising the urgency of adopting digital financial systems. “There are a lot of misunderstandings about digital currency and different thoughts, but we cannot ignore its future and the coming revolution,” he said. 

Masud added that “there is around $27.6 trillion worth of stablecoins globally and increasing,” calling the development both “a threat to the US dollar's sovereignty” and “a smart step by Washington.” He urged Islamabad to act decisively, saying: “Shape the rules before they shape you.” He also revealed that Pakistan is “seriously considering a rupee stablecoin”. 

He described the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as a transition “away from printed currency to digitalised currency,” calling it “a clear-cut case of financial inclusion.” However, Masud warned that “cybersecurity remains a major challenge” and that “regulatory ambiguity and negative public perception” persist in Pakistan.

Singapore-based expert Yara Wu, who has visited Pakistan four times since November 2024, said that adopting a CBDC could substantially lower remittance transfer costs for Pakistan, offering a secure and efficient alternative to existing channels.

Sajid Amin of SDPI said the country needs a clear, consistent approach to digital assets. “Challenges are also there,” he said. “Cyber protection is an issue — how safe it is and how to safeguard from scams.”

Faisal Mazhar, Deputy Director of Payments at the SBP, confirmed that “we have been working on digital currency since 2022,” with support from the World Bank and IMF. He described the CBDC as “an evolutionary process,” adding that a prototype is under development before launching a pilot phase.

Experts at the conference agreed that digital finance could significantly cut remittance costs, expand financial inclusion, and align Pakistan with global fintech trends — but warned that delay could mean missing a transformative economic opportunity.

Crypto markets began the weekend on a steady note, with the Bitcoin price hovering near $102,000 and traders closely watching altcoins for momentum. After a week of mixed ETF inflows and muted macroeconomic triggers, the market appears to be entering a consolidation phase—characterized by stability in major indices and bursts of activity in select gainers. 

As volatility compresses across large caps, smaller tokens like Filecoin FILUSDT, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance FETUSDT, and Internet Computer ICPUSDT have emerged as standout performers, signaling renewed speculative interest among retail traders.

Bitcoin BTCUSDT traded in a narrow range between $101,500 and $102,300, while Ether ETHUSDT held slightly above $3,450, showing early signs of stabilization after midweek pressure. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization stood at $3.45 trillion, down about 0.4% in the past 24 hours. 

Market Sentiment & Technical Snapshot

Market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index steady at 25 (Fear)—suggesting confidence despite subdued price action. On the technical front, BTC's consolidation above $100,000 support indicates accumulation, while resistance at $112,000 continues to cap short-term upside. Analysts point to this range as a potential “coil phase” that could precede a decisive move next week.

ETH mirrors Bitcoin's pattern, with resistance near $3,700 likely to dictate near-term momentum. Meanwhile, top gainers such as FIL (+45%), FET (+37%), and ICP (+23%) have outperformed the broader market, underscoring a shift in trader attention toward high-beta assets. The sudden rotation into these smaller tokens reflects increased appetite for risk as large-cap volatility declines.

Broader Context & Outlook

Recent ETF data shows net inflows turning positive after midweek outflows, suggesting institutional confidence remains intact. Macroeconomic cues have also been mildly supportive, with softer U.S. Treasury yields and a weaker dollar helping crypto assets stabilize after last week's pullback.

Analysts say the market is entering a two-speed phase—Bitcoin and Ether consolidating, while altcoins and niche sectors experience sharper short-term moves. If BTC manages to clear the $110,500 level, momentum could quickly broaden across the market, setting the tone for mid-November.

For now, traders expect range-bound movement over the weekend with bursts of volatility driven by emerging gainers—a familiar setup in crypto's pre-rally consolidation phases.

FAQs

Sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with the Fear & Greed Index at 25, reflecting steady confidence despite quieter price action.

Filecoin, FET, and ICP are leading gains, boosted by renewed risk appetite as large-cap volatility cools and traders shift toward high-beta tokens.

Recent ETF inflows turned positive, hinting at steady institutional interest and helping Bitcoin and Ethereum hold their consolidation zones.

A breakout is possible if Bitcoin clears $110,500, which could spark broader momentum across altcoins and set the tone for mid-November trading.

Trump Media and Technology Group, a media company pursuing a crypto treasury strategy, held $1.3 billion in Bitcoin as of September 2025, according to Arkham Intelligence.

The company has positioned Bitcoin as a core component of its liquid assets to support long-term treasury goals. A portion of Trump Media's Bitcoin holdings serves as collateral for convertible notes, reflecting integrated financial planning.

Trump Media recently acquired additional Bitcoin as part of its ongoing accumulation efforts, joining a growing number of corporations adopting the digital asset for treasury reserves.

A retired teacher says a Bitcoin scam took her life savings — and now she might lose her home. The warning she wants everyone to hear. 7's Heather Walker has this exclusive investigation.

Karla Kelley thought she had set herself up for a nice, comfortable retirement after 30 years of teaching.

Karla Kelley, Bitcoin ATM scam victim: “I had worked all my life to get to a point where I had no debt.”

But one phone call changed that.

Karla Kelley: “They put a fear into me, it's like, ‘Oh, my gosh.'”

Karla says she got an email about her PayPal account and was given a phone number to call. That's when she got the bad news.

Karla Kelley: “Your account is in jeopardy; somebody has got your identity.”

The man on the phone said her account was hacked and criminals now had access to her bank accounts. So, she needed to take steps to protect her money.

Karla Kelley: “The guy asked me how much I have in my savings account, and I said, ‘$5,000.' He said ‘OK, take the $5,000 and put it into it,'” and he gave me a bitcoin machine.”

The man told her to take her money out of the bank and put it in bitcoin, but the man wasn't done. Over the coming weeks, he claimed to be working with the police and said all of her bank and investment accounts were in danger of being stolen.

Heather Walker: “I know people are going to be watching and say, ‘How did she fall for this?'”

Karla Kelley: “I know it, I know it. If I was watching me, I would be saying the same thing. It's the fear.”

Scammers use fear to steal billions of dollars from people all across the country.

Karla Kelley: “In the very beginning, they told me you cannot tell anybody because it could jeopardize the investigation. So I'm like, ‘Well, all right, the FBI knows what they are doing. I certainly don't want to jeopardize their investigation.' So I didn't say anything to my daughter, my friends, and I lived with 14 months with this fear and anxiety.”

Experts say the crooks know exactly how to manipulate their victims.

Karen Murillo, AARP Florida: “This is not something to be ashamed or embarrassed about. This is a game of numbers for the scammers; they are targeting us at a crazy rate these days.”

The actual number of victims is unknown because many people never report the crime.

A police body camera was rolling as this Texas woman inserted her life savings into a bitcoin atm. Not stopping, even when the police arrived.

These Bitcoin ATMs are a huge problem. Florida has more than 3,000 of them in stores across the state, and none of them are regulated.

Karen Murillo: “These scammers are exploiting the lack of consumer protections.”

There is no daily transaction limit, and most of the time when the money is sent, it's gone instantly — because only the scammers have access to the cryptocurrency.

Karen Murillo: “It's devastating, and Florida needs more protections.”

AARP Florida is pushing lawmakers to regulate Bitcoin ATMs and require the owners to pay back people whose money is stolen.

It's too late for Karla. Her money is gone, and now she could lose her home.

Karla Kelley: “I've raised my daughter here, we've had Christmas, Thanksgiving, people all out on the patio, you know, we have a lot of memories here.”

Her daughter is trying to help – using social media to raise funds and warn others. She started a GoFundMe.

Now, with help from her family and friends, Karla is trying to rebuild her life.

Karla Kelley: “I can't blame myself because I'm a trusting person. I thought I was doing the right thing.”

Her lesson to others – if anyone asks you to put money in a bitcoin ATM – stop and call police.

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - November 7, 2025) - Nexcel Metals Corp. NEXX (OTCQB: NXXCF) (FSE: 2OH) ("Nexcel" or the "Company") is pleased to announce a non-brokered private placement (the "Private Placement") for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $3,500,000 that will consist of the issuance of a combination of:

Each FT Unit shall consist of one flow-through common share of the Company (a "FT Unit Share") and one common share purchase warrant (a "FT Unit Warrant"). Each FT Unit Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one non-flow-through common share of the Company at an exercise price of $0.50 for a period of 24 months from the date of issuance.

Each NFT Unit shall consist of one non-flow-through common share of the Company and one common share purchase warrant (a "NFT Unit Warrant"). Each NFT Unit Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one non-flow-through common share of the Company at an exercise price of $0.45 for a period of 24 months from the date of issuance.

Each FT Unit Share will qualify as a "flow-through share" within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the "Tax Act"). The gross proceeds from the sale of the FT Units will be used to incur "Canadian exploration expenses" on any of the Lac Ducharme Property located in Quebec and the Burnt Hill Property located in New Brunswick which will qualify as "flow-through mining expenditures" as those terms are defined in the Tax Act, and which the Company intends to renounce to the subscribers of the FT Units.

The sale of the maximum number of FT Units and the HD Units under the Private Placement, and the common shares of the Company ("Common Shares") to be issued thereunder and issuable upon exercise of the FT Unit Warrants and the NFT Unit Warrants thereunder, will result in the issuance of more than 100% of the current number of issued and outstanding Common Shares, which will require approval by shareholders of the Company ("Shareholders") under Policy 4 of the Canadian Securities Exchange (the "CSE"). In accordance with Section 4.6(1)(b) of Policy 4 of the CSE, the Company will be seeking approval of Shareholders holding more than 50% of the outstanding Common Shares at at November 7, 2025 by written consent.

The net proceeds from the sale of the NFT Units will be used for additional exploration work on the Company's properties and for general and administrative expenses and working capital purposes.

The Company may issue cash and/or securities as finder's fees in connection with the Private Placement in accordance with applicable securities laws and the policies of the CSE.

Closing of the Private Placement is anticipated to occur on or about December 5, 2025 (the "Closing Date") and is subject to customary conditions. All securities issued pursuant to and in connection with the Private Placement will be subject to a statutory hold period of four months and one day from the Closing Date.

The securities described herein have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any U.S. state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or available exemptions from such registration requirements. This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in the United States, or in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

Watson shared in the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his role in elucidating the structure of DNA. Credit: AP

James Dewey Watson — who won the Nobel Prize for his role in divining the structure of DNA; was instrumental in initiating and propelling the Human Genome Project; and who became notorious for his history of racist and sexist comments — has died at 97.

The discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA paved the way for scientists to unravel the mechanisms behind genetic inheritance and how cells synthesize proteins. Gene therapies, the sequencing of the human genome and the development of monoclonal antibodies as treatments for cancer are just a few of the developments that would not have been possible without an understanding of DNA's structure.

“The elucidation of the structure of the double helix goes down, along with Mendel and Darwin, as the three greatest discoveries in biology,” says Bruce Stillman, president of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, where Watson had various positions.

Watson and Francis Crick, who worked together at the University of Cambridge, UK, solved the structure of DNA within a few years of their first meeting. In 1953, they published a seminal paper1 in Nature titled A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. Watson had just turned 25.

“For him, nothing was impossible,” says Robert Martienssen, a geneticist at Cold Spring Harbor. “Nothing was out of reach.”

But the discovery of the DNA helix also became enmeshed in controversy. Watson and Crick elucidated the complex structure with the help of data and ideas from Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, who were working at King's College London at the time. Some of these data were shared without Franklin's permission. Wilkins was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 with Watson and Crick. Franklin had died of ovarian cancer 4 years earlier at the age of 37, and so was ineligible for the award.

Watson and Crick, “could have — and should have — requested permission to use the data and made clear exactly what they had done, first to Franklin and Wilkins, and then to the rest of the world”, wrote Matthew Cobb, and Nathaniel Comfort, historians of science at the University of Manchester, UK, and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, respectively, in a 2023 essay2 on Franklin.

In the aftermath of the discovery, Watson was particularly unkind about Franklin and dismissive of the role of women in science generally. In a best-selling book about the discovery of the double helix, he criticized Franklin's appearance and wrote, “The thought could not be avoided that the best home for a feminist was in another person's lab.”

Colleagues who were close to Watson have long had to wrestle with his mixed legacy. Nancy Hopkins, a molecular biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, says that Watson convinced her to pursue her PhD, at a time when few women pursued careers in science. When she launched her own lab and feared she might not get tenure, Watson convinced her to push on. “Just keep working and when you come up for tenure, if the letters are good enough, you'll get tenure. Or I'll sue them,” Hopkins says Watson told her.

Hopkins later became a vocal advocate for women in science and says that she is just one of many women Watson trained and supported. She also says she is bewildered by Watson's rhetoric on race.

End racism in science

A 2001 lecture at the University of California, Berkeley, left many in the audience stunned when Watson made remarks linking skin colour to sexual libido, and thinness to ambition.

“That was the beginning of the end,” Hopkins says of the lecture. “What happened later on, I just don't know the answer.”

In 2007, Watson abandoned a book tour after asserting that he thought Black people are less intelligent than white people. At the time, he was still active at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he had once been the director and had helped to make the lab a pre-eminent scientific institution. But he was removed from his leadership roles at the lab for his statements about race and intelligence. The institution severed ties with him completely after he made similar remarks in 2020. He also had a history of anti-Semitic comments, such as a 2007 remark that “Some anti-Semitism is justified.”

“There is a limit to human charity," said Lady Outram, trembling all over."There is," said Father Brown dryly, "and that is the real difference between human charity and Christian charity. You must forgive me if I was not altogether crushed by your contempt for my uncharitableness today; or by the lectures you read me about pardon for every sinner. For it seems to me that you only pardon the sins that you don't really think sinful. You only forgive criminals when they commit what you don't regard as crimes, but rather as conventions. So you tolerate a conventional duel, just as you tolerate a conventional divorce. You forgive because there isn't anything to be forgiven.”― G.K. Chesterton, The Complete Father Brown

That's what the hands free laws in most states addressed- using a cellphone while driving became a primary offense, something you could be pulled over for or ticketed for even if you hadn't done anything else wrong.The ultimate goal is to stop people from distracted driving before they cause an accident, but it's not always easy to see who should be stopped and who shouldn't, so a lot of people get away with it anyway.

That is false.  People get pulled over all the time for obvious distractions.  Someone addicted to watching the hundreds of bodycam video channels.Perhaps the cops in your area were told to focus on other things.  The Sheriff in my area are somewhat like that whereas the state troopers will happily pull someone over that looks suspicious or has out of state plates distractions aside.  Enforcement and abuse vary by location.

Sounds like something that could be easily abused for cracking down on filming police or similar. Filming ICE agents arresting someone and posting on tiktok? "obstruction of justice", plus they're obviously doing it "for social media". Same for whistleblowers or security researchers.

Your last two sentences point in the correct direction: we can't micro-target every behavior that might possibly become a dangerous distraction, because that's just about everything. Driving safely depends on self-regulation, and people incapable of self-regulating (to a minimum standard) shouldn't be granted the privilege of a license.

Mostly the ones I drove were able to tell if I was distracted by checking my instruments or mirrors, or over my shoulder before changing lanes.I came very close to just abandoning the fucking thing in a car park, and getting a train instead.

Someone just needs to put that in a car. We've also got lidar based cruise control systems to maintain distance as well as panic brake systems that can react to something in front of the vehicle faster than a human, which is partially there to account for people texting and driving while flying up on a red light with stopped traffic.We have all the tech needed to make it damn near impossible for a 2 ton mass of steal to just unflinchingly mow someone down, yet we live in a world where it's cheaper to not make those things standard, even knowing without it, more people will die than with it.

A recent letter from OpenAI reveals more details about how the company is hoping the federal government can support the company's ambitious plans for data center construction.

The letter — from OpenAI's chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane and addressed to the White House's director of science and technology policy Michael Kratsios — argued that the government should consider expanding the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC) beyond semiconductor fabrication to cover electrical grid components, AI servers, and AI data centers.

The AMIC is a 35% tax credit that was included in the Biden administration's Chips Act.

“Broadening coverage of the AMIC will lower the effective cost of capital, de-risk early investment, and unlock private capital to help alleviate bottlenecks and accelerate the AI build in the US,” Lehane wrote.

OpenAI's letter also called for the government to accelerate the permitting and environmental review process for these projects, and to create a strategic reserve of raw materials — such as copper, alumimum, and processed rare earth minerals — needed to build AI infrastructure.

The company first published its letter on October 27, but it didn't get much press attention until this week, when comments by OpenAI executives prompted broader discussion about what the company wants from the Trump administration.

At a Wall Street Journal event on Wednesday, CFO Sarah Friar said the government should “backstop” OpenAI's infrastructure loans, though she later posted on LinkedIn that she misspoke:  “OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for our infrastructure commitments. I used the word ‘backstop' and it muddied the point.”

CEO Sam Altman also weighed in, writing that OpenAI does not “have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.”

“We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market,” he wrote, though he said the company had discussed loan guarantees “as part of supporting the buildout of semiconductor fabs in the US.”

In the same post, Altman wrote that the company expects to end 2025 “above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate and grow to hundreds of billion by 2030,” and he said OpenAI has made $1.4 trillion in capital commitments for the next eight years.

What's it like to pitch your dream on Shark Tank, get rejected on national TV in front of 8 million people — and then turn that failure into a company Amazon later buys for more than $1 billion? Ring founder Jamie Siminoff did just that. 

A serial inventor and entrepreneur, Siminoff joins us on this episode of the GeekWire Podcast to talk about his new book, Ding Dong: How Ring Went from Shark Tank Reject to Everyone's Front Door (out Nov. 10), sharing the messy, high-stakes, and ultimately inspiring story behind the company.

Now back at Amazon as a vice president leading Ring and the company's home-security businesses, Siminoff reflects on failure, reinvention, and what comes next in the age of AI.

Listen below, subscribe on Apple or Spotify, and keep reading for highlights. 

What he learned writing the book: The book was almost therapeutic — just going back and looking at this stuff. … My best traits, my most powerful traits, the things that make me successful, are also the worst ones.

The importance of having a bigger mission: At Ring, if we had failed, I could still sit here today and say “We tried to make neighborhoods safer.” At least we were successful at trying something. And so that's where I think mission is just so powerful.

Establishing a company culture with a strong point of view: A real culture is something that not everyone feels matches them … Two things can coexist at the same time: You can have a ton of empathy and care about people and also be a hard-charger.

The inventor's mindset: Invention is not just product. Invention's everything. It's the process. And I think you can invent everywhere. … If you boil down what an inventor is, anything I see that's broken, I'm fixing it. I can't help myself.

Returning to Amazon: The thing that you get from leaving and coming back is the clarity of everything. I got to really see clearly everything we did, what we did wrong, what we did right. And so coming back, I feel like I have a newfound clarity for the business.

The impact of AI: What's crazy now is with AI, all those timelines are collapsing on themselves. In the next 12 months, I can't even imagine what we're going to be able to accomplish. … AI understands more like a human, [which] allows you to do things that are just completely different and more efficient.

1. the title was unneccessarily editorialized,
2. the word gamified is used wrong here, and
3. There was never any good reason to add the word gamified to the title, other than adding a buzzword.The feedback people give is probably a bit harsh, but I find it understandable. If you don't know what a term means, don't use it - especially not if it's completely unnecessary as in this case.

I don't know if this will replace htop for me. The main feature seems to be 24 bit color and some aggressive styling. I'm too old fashioned for that.

reply

I kind of avoided it too, htop, bmon, iotop and nvidia-smi worked fine as it was. But eventually came across it for the Nth time and finally tried it out, it's basically all of them in one, with some nicer graphs and customization. Do I require it to do my job? No, but with it I need 3-4 tmux panes less to see the same info. Also does most of the stuff I used htop for, sorting by different things, filtering by letters and easy to kill the currently selected process.

It was the submitter's opinion that "gamified" was an accurate description for this page instead of using the actual title of the page.So while "editorialized" is a little formal, it is correct.Reporting on controversial issues is often editorialized, which may be where your feeling that it relates to deceit is coming from.

Editorialized here simply means applying editor-level changes to the title of the website to express an opinion. No deceit is implied.  It is against HN guidelines unless the title is unclear or does not fit.

There is also Below. Which has a much more htop/btop like interface than dstat. Below records system info over time, and allows time travel! However, it's not as convenient as dstat, not at a glance, as one has to to scrub through time. But it is pretty impressive system monitoring, great for what it is! It's per-process pressure metrics are also utterly unbeatable. The way it rolls up cgroups is also stellar.

At first glance one might think a tech startup and a feature film are worlds apart. Yet, as it happens, bootstrapping and building a tech company and producing an independent feature film are surprisingly similar. This was something that surprised me as I pivoted from startup CEO to movie producer. 

What can you learn from this? Your skills may be more transferrable than you thought, grit matters a lot, as do equal doses preparedness and luck.

Years after co-founding Wellpepper, a digital health startup, I produced This Bloody Country, an independent feature film, and I had expected the two experiences would be completely different. 

At their core, both start with a unique idea and a small team, naïve and determined enough to believe they can pull it off. The risks are high and many never make it. However, it turns out a surprising number of the fundamentals are the same. 

It all starts with an idea. Every startup and every film begins with a spark. For a startup, it's a problem worth solving. For a film, it's a story that needs to be told.

At Wellpepper, the spark was helping patients manage care outside the clinic. For This Bloody Country, it was creating a Western from a perspective that hadn't been seen before: a religious family of mostly women and children defending themselves in 1860s Utah Territory.

You build a founding team. The best early teams have some relevant skills and just enough hubris to believe they can figure out the rest.

For Wellpepper, the founding team was CTO Mike Van Snellenberg and me. Neither of us came from healthcare. We were technologists who believed we could apply product and design thinking to improve patient experiences. That outsider perspective became an advantage when we asked naïve questions, challenged assumptions, and moved faster than people who “knew” how things were supposed to work. 

For This Bloody Country, the founding team was writer/director Craig Packard and me. We didn't have studio backing, but we had a shared creative vision and the stubborn optimism to figure it out as we went. We had an award-winning script, written by Craig. We sought out diverse opinions on the characters, setting, and historical period, and pressure tested how the page would translate to screen by putting ourselves in the eyes of the audience. 

In both cases, we started by ideating on how to make the idea real — sketching, testing, and adjusting until we found something that resonated. Then we needed to figure out how to get it done with a business plan that was encapsulated in a pitch deck. Next step was to find people who believed in our shared vision and were willing to invest. While Wellpepper was a C-corp, and the movie an LLC, both were designed as investment vehicles with cap tables. 

In startups, you're promising a future that doesn't exist yet. In film, you're selling a story that hasn't been made. The ability to convey “why this, why now, and why us” determines whether you find your first investors.

You need to be ready to take advantage of luck. Luck is when preparation meets opportunity, and we had early lucky encounters with both projects. 

For Wellpepper, we met Dr. Terry Ellis from Boston University when all we had was a prototype. Dr. Ellis, an expert in Parkinson's disease, was studying how care outside the clinic could help slow the progression of the disease and became one of our first research partners. That collaboration resulted in two randomized controlled trial studies (one also in collaboration with Dr. Jonathan Bean from Harvard), and publications in peer-reviewed journals — powerful validation that our product actually improved outcomes. 

For This Bloody Country, our lawyer's extended family happened to serve on the board of Deer Springs Ranch in Kanab, Utah — which became our primary filming location. The incredible vistas offered million-dollar backdrops to our movie. We also could not have made the film without the help of his extended family: our lawyer's sister-in-law, an expert in period costumes, was our costume designer, and his brother-in-law served as armorer, art department, and even played a bandit.

Sometimes good timing and luck show up disguised as coincidence. What matters is being ready to recognize opportunity when it knocks.

Beginner's mind helps you recognize patterns. Many people in both industries told me it couldn't be done. In healthcare, experts warned that startups couldn't navigate the complexity of clinical systems. In film, veterans said making an independent feature wasn't anything like running a startup. 

They were right — and wrong. The details are different, but the patterns are the same. Both require solving complex, human problems with limited resources and incomplete information.

Approaching each challenge with a beginner's mind — curious, open, and unconstrained by “how it's always been done” — was essential. The key is not assuming you know the answer but recognizing familiar shapes in new contexts: building a vision, assembling a team, creating a project plan, and delivering a product to a customer or audience. 

In both startups and films, you must hire quickly, fire carefully, and align people around the mission. You look for collaborators who can thrive in ambiguity, bring specialized expertise, and check their ego at the door. Whether it's an engineer or a cinematographer, success depends on people who believe in the vision and are willing to do what it takes to get the job done.

The ability to translate experience across domains — without assuming they're identical — is what made both ventures work. You can't import the playbook, but you can import the mindset.

Bootstrap before you scale. It's often said that a CEO needs to wear all hats before they hire them, they won't be the best at the role, but will lead better when the role is filled by an expert. In a startup or indie film, founder or producer; you're the marketer, accountant, and sometimes the one hauling gear or answering the tech support hotline.

You learn to do more with less, to make trade-offs, and to keep momentum alive even when there's no money left in the budget. You've got to be okay asking for favors and negotiating. In general, people want to help, and you'd be amazed at what you might get if you ask. 

Iteration, testing, and refining. There's a saying in startups that if you're not embarrassed by your first product release, you waited too long to ship. The same can be said for getting a rough cut of a film in front of trusted viewers. 

For both though, you have to be strong in your vision to explore any feedback that indicates that there may be a problem. In both the startup and the movie if something was confusing to the end-consumer, that was an indication that we needed to iterate and provided the north star for making changes.

Headwinds vs tailwinds. As Mike Tyson said, “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.” Both paths are defined by risk, and can benefit from, or be challenged by factors outside of your control. Competitors get press or funded, a very similar film or genre succeeds or flops. Regulatory changes offer benefits or drawbacks. Wellpepper was helped by value-based care initiatives which provided tailwinds. The film faced some additional costs due to COVID-related regulations while we were screening. You wake up every morning knowing the plan may not survive the day. Being able to pivot and having resilience are key to getting it done. 

It's harder to do it in Seattle. When we started Wellpepper, we were turned down by a lot of VCs because we weren't in Silicon Valley. There were essentially only two VC firms in town. We were told to move. We didn't, and that probably made it harder, but it also paved the way for many more digital health startups in town. Similarly, it probably would have been easier to get a movie made in L.A. where the primary industry is showbiz, but we found a small, committed group here (shout out to our executive producers and camera department) and quietly made something outside of the system. 

What founders and filmmakers can learn from each other

Don't index on the outliers. We've all heard the overnight success stories: the film that had a bidding war at a big festival, the startup that came out of nowhere and was aquired by a big tech company. The reality is that most people toil for a long time before you hear of them. That film script might have been on the shelf for years. The startup might have pivoted from something you hadn't heard of. Build what you believe in for the customer you want to serve, and try not to pay attention to the seemingly quick wins others are getting. 

Think about distribution from the beginning. How is your product going to get to the customer? How will they hear about it? Where will they get it? Putting an app in the app store or a video on a streaming platform is really only the first step of distribution. While most film is now digital, there are still distributors that facilitate getting the content to all the places it can be streamed (which often have different format requirements or submission guidelines). While there are outlets such as FilmHub that enable self-distribution, rising above the noise often requires help from a third party, just like software. 

Build a team for the long run. The team will make or break your project, and while we all like to think success will be quick, you may be working with these folks over a long period. You're going to be having long nights, and need to pull off miracles with this team. Hire people that you would hire again and again whether that's for your next creative project, your next startup, or building a team within a big company if you decide to go that route. 

Learn how to tell stories. Storytelling coupled with passion convinces people. Whether pitching investors or distributors, clarity and emotional resonance are your most powerful tools. When this comes through in your product or your film, it connects with your users and audiences. Start measuring early — whether that's clicks, social media mentions, Kickstarter supporters. Showing that there is a market for your product or for your film requires data. Data is a key part of the storytelling that convinces people.

Be ready for luck. Be prepared (or know when to drop everything to prepare) to take advantages of opportunities when they present themselves. Getting more traction than you expected is a solvable problem. Don't be afraid to scale. 

Creating something out of nothing is an act of optimism. Sticking with it is an act of grit. The data back this up: roughly 90% of startups fail, and about 97% of independent films don't recoup their investment. Wellpepper was among that small group of startups that achieved a successful exit when it was acquired in 2020, which gave me the confidence to take on the film challenge. This Bloody Country has not finished its journey yet, but it has been picked up by Quiver Distribution, is receiving audience praise, and is available to buy and rent on most streaming platforms. 

At the end of the day, both journeys are about creating impact, whether for a patient empowered to manage their own health, or an audience thrilled and moved by a story. And in both worlds, the real victory isn't just the exit or the box office — it's gathering an incredible group of people to build an idea into something tangible to share with the world.

GEO Group, ICE's largest contractor, held an earnings call on Thursday where it discussed the future of its business as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up immigration enforcement in the U.S.

The company foresees a rise in the number of people held in detention, as well as more people being monitored through phone apps and ankle bracelets. But the numbers aren't quite as high as they envisioned before Trump came back into office for a second time in January.

GEO said it expects to “scale up immigration detention to approximately 100,000 beds or more from the approximately 60,000 beds ICE is currently utilizing,” according to a transcript of the earnings call from Seeking Alpha. The company expects even more people to be monitored in what's called “alternative to detention,” (ATD) schemes, which can include everything from check-in via a smartphone app to ankle monitors that are required to be worn at all times.

SmartLINK, the smartphone app, is currently used by about 147,000 people, while about 30,000 have ankle monitors, according to Bloomberg. The tracking program is run by BI Inc., which started in 1978 making a tracking device for cattle, according to the Washington Post. GEO said it expects to see more reliance on ankle monitors in the future.

The Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) is a subprogram within ATD that applies to people who are considered high risk for flight but are still allowed to live in the community rather than being locked up in a detention center. BI secured a contract worth as much as $1 billion for ISAP. GEO said Thursday a new contract allows for 465,000 participants in the ISAP program within the next two years, up from 183,000 in the old contract.

One of the bottlenecks for GEO has been the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who has instituted a policy that any contracts above $100,000 be reviewed and approved by Noem personally. That new policy was blamed for a slow response by FEMA to a deadly flood in Texas back in July. Noem denied it, but the New York Times reported in August that other spending requests weren't getting through as quickly as they should.

GEO cited that bottleneck as the first of three reasons that the “pace of new detention contracts has been slower than anticipated.” The second reason was the government shutdown, which has meant that people awarding new contracts are being more cautious. The third reason cited by GEO is the lack of staff to ramp up deportation efforts. ICE wants to double its employee count from approximately 10,000 to 20,000 people but GEO notes that is “time and staff intensive.”

“There's millions of people that are on the non-detained docket,” GEO founder and executive chairman George Zoley said on the earnings call. “And there's going to be a desire to provide more clarity as to where they are, what stage they are in with respect to their hearing process, and making sure they get to their hearing and if they're not qualified to be in the country to deport them.”

GEO Group donated $1 million to Trump's re-election campaign according to OpenSecrets. The company contributed $500,000 more to Trump's inaugural committee, according to CREW.

As Bloomberg notes, GEO has cuts its earnings forecast, which sent the company's stock down 10%. GEO Group saw its share price soar after Election Day, going from $14.18 on Nov. 4, the day before the election, to $26.48 a couple of days after the election. The stock price closed at $15.13 on Friday.

“While the exact timing of government actions, including new contract awards is difficult to estimate, as a management team, we are focused on maintaining a level of readiness to successfully pursue and capture future growth and continuing to allocate capital to enhance value for our shareholders,” said Zoley.

Consumers are in for a shock.

A few Japanese computer stores in Akihabara have started limiting the sales of storage and memory modules due to limited inventory. According to Akiba PC Hotline [machine translated], several shops have imposed limits to prevent hoarding, with one limiting customers to just eight items per group. Another one has even more stringent restrictions, only releasing two storage drives or SO-DIMMs and up to four pieces of memory per buyer, although customers buying a completely new PC can negotiate for a higher limit.

These shops imposed these caps because they haven't been receiving the expected number of deliveries for these items, and their inventories are running low. Distributors are reportedly suspending deliveries of some products, with no clear outlook for when supply will return to normal. This crunch means that prices for these components are expected to skyrocket, with PC builders and enthusiasts looking for performance parts to be hit the hardest by the shortage and price hikes.

The shortage of these memory and storage chips is caused by the massive demand for AI GPUs, with manufacturers pivoting their production lines to accommodate the insatiable demand for SSDs, DRAM, and HDDs for the AI infrastructure build-out. It's gotten to the point that memory pricing has already climbed by 100%, meaning you'll have to pay a lot more for the best RAM for gaming.

You also won't save money if you opt for older DDR4 tech, as supply for these chips has also started dwindling, as memory makers transition to the newer and more lucrative DDR5 modules. This meant that companies still using this for cheaper product lines are now stockpiling supplies, further increasing your costs if you're looking to replace or upgrade the memory on your older system. While some companies are extending or restarting DDR4 production, their volumes are not sufficient to reduce market pressure.

This perfect storm of increased demand and reduced supply has pushed the memory and storage industry to the brink, with consumers getting shocked by the pricing changes. Even if manufacturers want to increase production capacity, it takes years to build new factories capable of churning out more memory and storage chips. Aside from that, there's the specter of the AI bubble, with many experts saying we are already in one, and that the pop is just a matter of time. Because of this, companies might avoid aggressive expansion, as demand could vanish at any time.

Startups have never been able to offer the same sizable salaries as big tech companies. Now with companies like Meta and OpenAI willing to pay million-dollar salaries amid the AI race — the compensation divide has grown even larger.

Early-stage startups are not doomed though. If they develop a compensation strategy that is generous, fair, and flexible, they can offer competitive compensation packages and give themselves room to adjust their approach as they grow, according to founders and experts who were onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.

Startups shouldn't try to compete with big tech companies anyway, Yin Wu, the co-founder and CEO of equity management software Pulley, said on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt in October. She added that a stable tech company and a startup don't generally attract the same potential candidates to begin with.

Startups should instead be as charitable as they can in their compensation packages, Wu said, regardless of their inability to match a big tech company's paycheck.

“My pretty strong opinion when it comes to equity for a startup is that you should be more generous than what you think you should be,” Wu said. “I think it is unlikely, if the company is really successful, you're going to look back and say, ‘man, I gave away too much equity of everyone that was at my company trying to make this company really successful.'”

Randi Jakubowitz, the head of talent at 645 Ventures, agreed. Jakubowitz added that when a startup is looking to make a competitive offer, they should set clear goals for the person they are hiring to ensure that hire lives up to the compensation they are getting.

“Make sure you're holding them accountable and make sure that you understand what the implications are from a vesting cliff standpoint,” Jakubowitz said, regarding when employees gain control over their equity stakes. “That's where, if you don't move quickly if someone's underperforming, that's equity that you'll never get back if they are fully vested. Make sure that there's very clear accountability. “

The panelists also stressed that companies don't need to get their compensation and equity strategies set in stone from the start. Startups should instead ensure their approach is fair from the beginning, so even if they do want to change, they have the proper foundation to do so without setting themselves up for legal trouble or soured office politics.

For Wu, and her company Pulley, that meant setting standards around compensation packages. Wu said the company pays a set range for each role — regardless of where a potential employee is based — and consistently builds compensation packages with equity offerings in the 90th percentile.

“Having this framework allowed us to be able to grow and say ‘great, as the company continues to do well, the actual number of shares you receive is going to differ because the value the companies differ, but that framework is still applied.”

Rebecca Lee Whiting, founder of Epigram Legal and fractional general counsel, added that having these standards will help companies avoid potential legal pitfalls down the line. For instance, it helps companies avoid offering unequal pay across candidates of different genders — which is something all companies should try to avoid ethically — but is also illegal in states like California, Whiting noted.

Whiting, Wu and, Jakubowitz all agreed that as long as founders approach building their compensation packages with fair intentions, everything else can be adjusted or changed down the line.

“I think it's really important to think about not just that process. Think about who are the people you're trying to hire and what is going to incentivize them to take that offer,” Whiting said. “It's not something that you have to get right out of the gate. You will likely have to do clean up post the Series B and acknowledging that is okay. But don't try and get it perfect out of the out of the gate when you're hiring your first few people.”

These are some robust storage devices.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has successfully recovered the black boxes — including the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) — of the ill-fated UPS Airlines Flight 2976, with the agency saying that it has fully pulled the cockpit audio from their charred remains. According to the NTSB's YouTube briefing, it secured over 2 hours of digitally recorded audio, including the last 25 seconds of the flight during which the accident sequence occurred. Below are also images of the black boxes throughout the data forensics process.

“The cockpit voice recorder contained two hours and four minutes of what we consider good quality digital recorded audio. In reviewing that audio, the crew completed their standard checklists and briefings in preparation for the flight,” said NTSB Member Todd Inman, one of the five officials leading the investigative agency. He also added, “About 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust, a repeating bell was heard on the CVR, which persisted until the end of the recording 25 seconds later. During this time, the crew engaged in efforts to attempt to control the aircraft before the crash.”

The CVR and FDR are data recording devices mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for installation on all commercial aircraft. These are more popularly known as black boxes, although they are actually painted bright orange to make them easier to find in the debris field of any crash. Unfortunately, the recovered black boxes were severely charred black due to the intensity of the post-crash fire.

(Click 'See More' on the above tweet to see the embedded images of the black box.) These devices used magnetic tape when they were first introduced in the 1960s, but were eventually replaced by solid-state memory (SSDs) starting in the 1990s. This made them far more robust, allowing these units to safeguard the recorded data even in the most violent of events.

Once recovered, they assist the investigating body in determining the cause of the crash. The FDR records up to 25 hours of critical aircraft systems, and could include altitude, airspeed, heading, and over a thousand other parameters. In the meantime, CVRs record more than just the voices of the flight crew — instead, they capture everything audible in the cockpit, including aural warnings and other environmental sounds. These two devices have helped authorities solve mysteries time and again, allowing them to improve the entire aviation industry across the globe.

Even though the NTSB has already extracted UPS 2976's CVR, it's not releasing it to the public until the entire investigation is complete. Inman said that a team of experts on the MD-11, the model of the accident aircraft, will review the recording and output a transcript.

“Our role is not to speculate on the cause of why we're here. We want to know what happened and why it happened — and the most important thing is to make sure that it doesn't happen again,” says Inman. He then later said, “Now, this CVR transcript will be made public only when a majority of the other factual reports are placed in the NTSB public docket for this accident, and that will be several months from now.”

These black boxes are a marvel of engineering, especially considering how we often think of electronics as sensitive electronics. The FDR and CVR are designed to withstand 3,400Gs of impact force for 6.5 milliseconds, withstand 1,100 degrees Celsius for half an hour, and withstand 20,000 feet of underwater pressure. Nevertheless, we're sometimes surprised by the survivability of memory drives, like the 512GB SanDisk SD card found undamaged in the Titan submersible's wreckage.

It is undoubtedly the age of OLED these days, with a new display appearing about as fast as I can review them. Since they are so close in terms of contrast and color quality, the only way to differentiate the best OLED gaming monitors from the pack is with high refresh rates. We were satisfied with 240 Hz for quite some time, but now 500 Hz is the new normal.

Gigabyte's Aorus line has always contained high-performance displays, and the FO27Q5P is the latest addition. It's a 27-inch QHD 2560x1440 Quantum Dot OLED panel with 500 Hz, Adaptive-Sync, DisplayHDR 500 and wide gamut color. Let's take a look.

The FO27Q5P is absolutely packed with features and performance. Nothing has been left out, and, in a few areas, it outclasses all the competition. Starting with its 500 Hz refresh rate, that is a native figure, no overclocking required. I didn't even have to set the resolution when running Windows on it for the first time. It went right to 500 Hz without a hiccup. Of course, it's certified FreeSync Premium Pro, and it is G-Sync Compatible. It also features a black frame insertion option for reducing motion blur, and includes OLED anti-flicker technology to prevent artifacts during rapid changes in refresh rate. Every possible video processing option is included here.

The picture is stunning thanks to a Quantum Dot layer, which expands the color gamut to over 108% of DCI-P3. And accuracy comes out of the box with no need for calibration. Brightness is high, over 500 nits for HDR content, and you get variable brightness, meaning small highlights will exceed 1,000 nits. Black levels, it goes without saying, are OLED deep, meaning they are unmatched by any LCD technology.

Panel health is enhanced by passive cooling, which maximizes airflow through a graphene layer and component heatsinks, eliminating the need for fans. You also have extensive options for features like pixel shift, logo detection, and panel refresh. Gigabyte backs the FO27Q5P with a three-year warranty that includes burn-in.

Connectivity is also top-notch, with DisplayPort 2.1 support through two inputs, one of which is the mini version, and an output for daisy-chaining multiple screens with a single cable to your PC. You also get DP functions through the USB-C port, and there are two HDMI 2.1 inputs as well. KVM is supported by USB 3.2, one upstream and two downstream ports. There are two 3.5mm analog jacks, one for headphones and another for a microphone. The FO27Q5P is a complete gaming hub that lets you connect all your peripherals. A pair of internal speakers operates with 5 watts of power, and there's a backlit Aorus logo that can display different colors and effects.

My FO27Q5P arrived in a plain white box, suggesting that it was an early production sample. It's packed in cleverly engineered cardboard rather than crumbly foam, and the entire carton is recyclable. After assembling the three parts —base, upright, and panel —I found a small external power supply, plus HDMI, USB-C, and USB-A/B cables. There's a 100mm VESA mount for monitor arms, but no fasteners are included.

The FO27Q5P sticks to the two-piece version of OLED style, with the screen surrounded by a metal backing and a large component bulge attached to its backside. The bulge isn't too thick and is nicely accented up top by a backlit Aorus logo whose colors and effects can be controlled from the OSD. This separate panel approach makes cooling easier since air can flow through freely. There's a graphene layer behind the OLED, and no fans are required.

The stand is solid and substantial with a slender but wide base made from cast aluminum and finished in a fine crinkle powder coat. Adjustments include 5/20 degrees tilt, 20 degrees swivel and a 5.1-inch height adjustment. You also get a 90-degree portrait mode. Movements are firm with no wobble or play, which befits this premium display.

In the back, you can see a fine grill pattern offset by the LED lighting. There's an Aorus logo and two small accents underneath the stand attachment point. It doesn't draw too much attention to itself, but still adds a nice touch of visual flair. The stand has a cutout running its full length, and there's a cable clip to keep your wiring tidy.

The potential for lots of wiring is here thanks to the FO27Q5P's extensive connectivity. There are two DisplayPort 2.1 inputs, one standard and one mini, and the USB-C input supports DisplayPort. You also get two HDMI 2.1 inputs, and there's a DisplayPort output, something I rarely see. This means you can daisy chain multiple monitors with a single cable connection to the PC. USB is version 3.2 and has one upstream and two downstream ports. Full KVM functionality with a setup wizard is included in the OSD. Finally, there is a 3.5mm headphone jack and a 3.5mm microphone input. I'm surprised there isn't DVI and VGA back there too!

The FO27Q5P's OSD is packed with features for video processing and image adjustment. There are gaming aids, KVM switching, and even quick-change resolution options. Literally nothing has been left out here.

Gaming is first with VRR (Adaptive-Sync), which includes an anti-flicker function with two levels of correction. It is intended to prevent flicker during rapid changes in refresh rate. I ran several tests and never saw flickering, whether it was on or off. You also get Ultra Clear, which is a black frame insertion feature. It works at speeds below 250 Hz with VRR turned off. It cuts brightness by about 50% but it will eliminate blur at low frame rates. The magic number in my observation is 200fps. Anything above that doesn't need help, but below that, Ultra Clear is effective at keeping motion resolution high.

Each of the 10 picture modes has either all the image controls or a subset of them. Standard lets you change the important things like color temp and gamma. You also get gamut selection though to use sRGB, you must select the sRGB picture mode, which only allows brightness changes. The Native color space option covers just over 108% of the DCI-P3 color space.

The KVM wizard allows you to bind peripherals to video inputs via either USB-C or USB-B, enabling you to control multiple systems with a single keyboard, mouse, and display. It can be two PCs or a PC and a console, for example. The FO27Q5P has both PIP and PBP capabilities, allowing you to view two video sources simultaneously. The remaining settings are located in the System menu, where you can find the LED controls under RGB LED.

It took me a while to find the variable brightness options because Gigabyte hides them confoundingly in the OLED Care menu. It should be with the other image controls, not in a menu accessed outside the main OSD tree. It's called APL Stabilize and it has three settings. The closest one to constant brightness is Low. And it can only be adjusted for SDR content. In HDR mode, it's locked to its most aggressive level for the brightest possible highlights. Other options here include pixel shift, pixel clean and logo/corner dimming.

Gigabyte includes its full suite of Game Assist options with timers, a stopwatch, refresh rate indicator, and the ability to move the information around the screen. There are four different aiming points, and you get a sniper mode and night vision. Tactical Switch is a resolution toggle for changing screen aspect ratio and sizing on the fly.

Calibrating the FO27Q5P is purely optional if you pick the Standard picture mode. The default is Eco, and it limits brightness, so I recommend avoiding that one. With a few changes to the RGB sliders, I took grayscale tracking from good to great and tightened up the gamut chart in the process. Gamma tracks closely to the reference, so all detail is crisply rendered at all brightness levels. My SDR settings are below, with APL Stabilize set to Low. If you use Middle or High, you'll likely need a lower brightness value to keep the picture from being too harsh.

When an HDR signal is present, the FO27Q5P offers five specific modes, all but one of which are adjustable for brightness and contrast. The best choice there is HDR Peak 1000 because it has the most accurate luminance and color tracking. The FO27Q5P delivers some superb HDR with bright highlights and richly saturated color.

The FO27Q5P has several video processing options, so I'll take them one by one. Playing Doom Eternal and other similar titles at max detail on a GeForce RTX 4090-equipped PC, I saw framerates between 350 and 450 frames per second (fps). Though there was constant and wide fluctuation, I never needed to employ the anti-flicker setting. That's just as well because it doesn't work in HDR mode.

To use Ultra Clear, I had to disable Adaptive-Sync and reduce the refresh rate to 250 Hz. The only difference I noticed was the 50% reduction in brightness. It wasn't any smoother because motion was already perfect without help. It was obvious, though that this would be an effective tool to maintain high motion resolution at speeds below 200fps. There are no visible artifacts to spoil gameplay.

To explore the variable brightness feature, I had to play in SDR mode. With HDR content, the setting is grayed out and it's locked to the most aggressive level. That provides excellent HDR with brightly detailed highlights and deeply detailed shadow areas. Speaking of, the best HDR mode was Peak 1000. It delivers the best detail rendering and the most accurate color. Game and Cinema are very good too, but with a little less impact. Vivid should be avoided as it made the image look garish and cartoonlike.

Though a GeForce RTX 4090 provides very high frame rates, a 5090 would be the way to the FO27Q5P's full potential of 500fps. Black frame insertion (Ultra Clear) is something few OLEDs have, so if you have a slower card, it can adapt better than other displays.

Color and contrast were superb regardless of other settings as long as I stuck with HDR Peak 1000 or Standard for SDR content. I'm used to the larger DCI-P3 gamut for SDR even though it isn't strictly correct. The FO27Q5P has an sRGB mode which is accurate enough for critical work, but I noted slightly light gamma that could not be corrected. In Standard, there are gamut options but sRGB isn't among them.

For other tasks and media, the FO27Q5P is a great desktop tool. The pixel density of a 27-inch QHD screen provides a sharp image with no pixel structure visible at normal viewing distances. It certainly gave nothing away to Ultra HD screens when gaming. Smooth motion and high frame rates are always preferred over sheer pixel density.

I noted the FO27Q5P's large list of extras like USB ports, KVM, clear speakers with four audio modes, and its premium build quality and user experience. The speakers play clearly at decent volumes and the modes sound different from one another, with my favorite being Game for its broad and deep sound stage. Online players will appreciate the inclusion of both headphone and microphone jacks. That's something almost no monitors offer.

Takeaway: The FO27Q5P is a premium display in every way. It includes absolutely every feature under the sun for gaming, entertainment and productivity. The picture is gorgeous with rich color and contrast only an OLED can deliver. It exudes excellent build quality and solid feel. In the 27-inch QHD OLED category, it's hard to imagine better.

This move underscores a rapidly tightening memory market, affecting both flash and DRAM.

SanDisk has reportedly raised its NAND flash contract prices by a staggering 50% for November, according to DigiTimes Asia. This move underscores a rapidly tightening memory market, driven by both unrelenting demand from AI data centers as well as tightly constrained wafer supply.

The report cites market sources who say SanDisk's pricing update sent a shockwave through the storage supply chain, prompting module makers such as Transcend, Innodisk, and Apacer Technology to pause shipments and re-evaluate quotes. Transcend, in particular, suspended quoting and deliveries starting November 7, anticipating "continued favorable market conditions." Translation: "prices are likely going higher before they settle down."

If you want a snapshot of just how hot the memory business has gotten, look at the numbers:

 




All three credited their performance to the supply concentration at wafer fabs, which are prioritizing the production of high-margin DRAM, such as DDR5 and HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), for AI servers and high-performance computing gear. The catch: older DDR4 products — still essential for industrial and enterprise systems — are now in shorter supply, further inflating prices downstream.

It's the same story we've seen across the chip industry all year: AI workloads are sucking the air out of the room. Fabs are dedicating more lines to cutting-edge memory for GPUs and accelerators, leaving commodity segments like consumer SSDs, embedded modules, and mainstream DDR4 short. The result? A structural shortage that's boosting profits for memory vendors while leaving OEMs and end-users scrambling. DigiTimes notes that Transcend expects "upward momentum" in the market to persist as companies balance price hikes with limited production capacity.

If you were thinking about upgrading your rig or expanding your data center capacity, it might be time to pull the trigger sooner rather than later. Between SanDisk's NAND flash hikes and ongoing DRAM shortages, prices across SSDs and memory modules are trending only one way, and it's not down. History suggests that when memory makers smell profit, they don't rush to expand supply overnight. With AI still chewing through every spare chip the industry can make, this shortage could stretch well into 2026 — unless the AI bubble abruptly pops, but then our economy will have bigger things to worry about.

Two exciting drives to spearhead Samsung's SSD army into CES 2026

As the year draws to a close, anticipation for CES 2026 grows. Samsung has provided a preliminary preview of its forthcoming Detachable AutoSSD (AM9C1 E1.A) and PM9E1 M.2 22x42, a 2242 variant of the OEM drive designed to rival the best SSDs in the market. The radical new modular SSD design has a swappable NAND and SSD controller that can be detached independently. The company also showed off its new tiny 4TB PCIe 5.0 SSD.

Samsung introduced the original AM9C1 automotive SSD last year, a BGA drive that incorporates the company's proprietary 5nm PCIe 4.0 controller and 8th-generation V-NAND flash. The latest E1.A version of the AM9C1 maintains these components but now features a modular design. Consequently, Samsung markets the AM9C1 E1.A under the new Detachable AutoSSD series. The modular configuration separates the SSD controller from the NAND into two distinct modules, thereby facilitating upgrades and replacements. Samsung asserts that the new E1.A form factor also extends the product's operational lifespan by enhancing heat dissipation.

The original AM9C1 was available with capacities ranging from 128GB to 2TB, with sequential read speeds up to 4,700 MB/s and sequential write speeds up to 1,400 MB/s. It's modular AM9C1 E1.A form factor provides extensive versatility, allowing automotive manufacturers or owners to replace the PCIe 4.0 controller with a faster PCIe 5.0 alternative in the future or to increase storage capacity with higher-capacity NAND components.

The AM9C1 E1.A caters to autonomous vehicles. However, it is reasonable to envisage a similar implementation within the consumer SSD market. Samsung can easily port this design to the mainstream market; however, the associated costs are likely to be substantial, as is typical for cutting-edge technology.

The PM9E1 M.2 22x42 is essentially an iteration of the original PM9E1, rendered in a more compact form factor. The initial model is a M.2 2280, whereas this new variant, as indicated by its designation, is presented in an M.2 2242 package. Although not a prevalent form factor, it is commonly utilized in ultra-thin laptops, tablets, or mini-PCs. The PM9E1 M.2 22x42 is marginally too long for the Steam Deck, as the device employs M.2 2230 drives. Nonetheless, modifications exist to accommodate larger drives within Valve's gaming handheld; however, such alterations are not generally advisable.

The PM9E1 is a PCIe 5.0 drive featuring Samsung's 5nm Presto SSD controller and V8 TLC V-NAND. It essentially serves as the OEM variant of the Samsung 9100 Pro, tailored for the consumer market. The M.2 2242 segment is not very crowded; however, the PM9E1 M.2 22x42 will compete against Corsair's recently announced MP700 Micro. Similar to its competitor, the PM9E1 M.2 22x42 supports capacities of up to 4TB. This makes these M.2 2242 drives particularly appealing to Steam Deck users, as the increased surface area permits higher capacities, whereas M.2 2230 SSDs are limited to a maximum of 2TB.

The PM9E1 M.2 22x42 provides sequential read and write speeds of up to 14.8 GB/s and 13.4 GB/s, respectively. Consequently, it offers significantly higher performance compared to the MP700 Micro. The PM9E1 M.2 22x42 demonstrates a 48% increase in sequential read speeds and a 58% increase in sequential write speeds. Although the PM9E1 M.2 22x42 is classified as an OEM drive, Samsung's OEM products occasionally enter the grey market and are available at more competitive prices; however, this often entails the absence of the standard warranty typically associated with consumer products.

Samsung will likely disclose additional details regarding the AM9C1 E1.A and PM9E1 M.2 22x42 at the CES 2026, which is scheduled to take place from January 6 to 9 at the usual venue in Las Vegas.

The only smartphone manufacturer with a 10/10 iFixit repairability score is finally bringing its products to the US, but it isn't starting with its phones. Netherlands-based Fairphone announced this week that it will mark its expansion into the US with the Fairbuds XL, its repairable over-ear headphones. It'll be available on Amazon later this month.

Fairphone says it achieved 61 percent revenue growth in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, though this is likely attributed to the launch of The Fairphone (Gen 6)—the company doesn't release a new phone every year. It sold more than 100,000 units in 2024, including phones and audio products.

Right-to-repair laws have been cropping up all over the US, and Fairphone smartphones are the easiest to repair. The company provides a screwdriver, sells spare parts for years, and offers long-term software support. Its devices may not be the flashiest or the most powerful, but they are a more sustainable solution, also ensuring fair mining practices and wages for workers in its supply chain.

Bringing its smartphone over to the US is a little more complicated than headphones, as it requires carrier certifications, but Fairphone tells WIRED it's in “advanced discussions” with select retailers and carriers.

Meta seems to be on a quest to finally bring its apps to other platforms. A few months ago, it launched an Instagram app for the iPad; now we're getting WhatsApp on the Apple Watch. Rather than just mirroring your notifications and sending basic replies, now you can read full messages on the Apple Watch, record and send voice messages, see who's calling, send emoji reactions to messages, and see more of the chat history on the screen.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

It syncs with your iPhone, so you don't need to set it up as a companion device. You can't take calls on the watch itself or even answer them; you can see who is calling and decline. It also doesn't seem as though you can add the WhatsApp app as a complication.

It's a little earlier than usual, but Motorola's latest budget phones are here: the Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026. They share a similar look and aren't too different from the design language Motorola has employed on its 2025 Moto G devices. What's most notable is that the Moto G Play will have 5G support, making it one of the cheapest handsets with 5G at $170.

Both phones have 6.7-inch 120-Hz LCD screens, big 5,200-mAh batteries, and IP52 water resistance. They're powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 6300 processor with 4 GB of RAM, but they differ in storage size, with the Moto G offering 128 GB of internal storage and the Play with 64 GB (both are expandable with a microSD). Cameras are the other place where the two phones diverge, with a 50-MP main sensor on the Moto G and a 32-MP sensor on the Play. Yes, they still have headphone jacks.

Motorola says the Moto G Play will arrive first on November 13 at Motorola, Best Buy, and Amazon for $170, and the $200 Moto G launches on December 11 at Motorola's website first, then at Best Buy and Amazon on January 15.

Canon has announced its much-anticipated new EOS R6 Mark III full-frame mirrorless camera. The R6 III features a new 32.5-megapixel sensor (the same sensor in the EOS C50 cinema camera), as well as the company's latest Digic X processor.

The new technology means the R6 now shares more than a few features with Canon's more expensive R5 and R1 professional-level cameras, most notably perhaps the autofocus system of the R5, a significant step up from what was available in the R6 II.

The body of the R6 III is not hugely different than its predecessor. The 3.69-million-dot EVF and 3-inch articulating touchscreen are unchanged, though the R6 III uses Canon's newer, larger battery and adds a CFexpress Type B card slot. The CFexpress Type B helps with some of the impressive photo and video specs, including the ability to capture full-resolution RAW images—with autofocus—at up to 40 frames per second (12 fps if you use a purely mechanical shutter).

The video specs rival Canon's dedicated cinema cameras. The R6 III can shoot oversampled 4Kp60, 7K RAW, 7K Open Gate, and Canon Log 2 video. There's also support for features like waveform monitoring, and focus acceleration and deceleration (similar to the EOS Cinema C80).

The Canon EOS R6 Mark III will be available later in November for $2,799 (body only). There are a couple of kit options as well, including one with the RF 24-105mm f/4L for $4,049. You can preorder it today at B&H Photo. —Scott Gilbertson

Fans of dancehall and reggae music (or Jamaican beats in general) will adore Teenage Engineer's latest sample and mic, designed to help you make some extremely island-y jams. The European audio brand is famous for making gorgeous-sounding and beautifully designed musical instruments and recording equipment for the jet-setting class.

The Riddim n' Ting are meant to be “a complete rhythm and bass system” loaded with 200 instruments and loops over drums, bass, keys, and an FX loop. There are even preloaded samples from folks like King Jammy and Mad Professor, which should get you off to a quick start.

The EP-40 Riddim is based on the familiar EP-133 K.O. II sampler, so folks who know and like that tool will find an easy transition to this one. The EP-2350 Ting microphone comes with built-in effects, like echo, reverb, and pitch shifting. They are available together for $329 but will be sold separately later. —Parker Hall

The K565RU3 is a 16KB DRAM IC that was cloned from Western chips found in classic machines like the Apple II, Commodore PET, and original IBM PC.

A fascinating Soviet-era retro electronics artifact was dissected and micrographed by CPU collector CPU Duke this weekend. Under the enthusiast's selection of microscopes this time was the ‘K565PY3.' The IC under scrutiny was a Dynamic RAM chip with a 16KB capacity, and this particular sample was believed to have come from the Mezon factory in what is now Moldova. For context, we think the K565PY3 is a reverse-engineered clone of the 1970s/80s era Intel-designed 4116 DRAM chip.

#WeekendDieShots!Thanks to @RetroNora7734 for sending over some Russian ICs. Today, I started with the 16K × 1-bit Dynamic RAM made in Moldova probably at “Mezon” factory.A 🧵…The lid was really solid… had to open it like a fish can… pic.twitter.com/gmhUx1CHmFNovember 2, 2025

The first thing CPU Duke noticed about the K565PY3 was its sturdy “fish can” construction. However, it didn't take long to pop that off and begin the in-depth silicon survey, starting with a stereo microscope in light reflection mode. Immediately clear are the chip's structures and multitude of memory cells (of course).

CPU Duke dove deeper, with their ring light making it possible to peer into structures below the surface layer. Did they count them all? Our intrepid silicon sleuth commented that the IC storage consisted of “a 128 x 128 matrix of storage cells.”

Next up, CPU Duke switched to their metallurgical microscope to reveal a different level of detail. It was noted that some Cyrillic etching could be translated as the English word “Tempo,” indicating this was fast DRAM. Further visual analysis highlighted the “CAS (Column Address Strobe), RAS (Row Address Strobe), and the row decode section of the DRAM.” Techy folks who've spent any time tuning their modern PC memory will be familiar with terms like CAS and RAS values, and their relevance to memory and system performance.

CPU Duke provided a little background detail about the provenance of this ‘fish can' memory chip. Our investigations make it pretty clear this is a clone or reverse-engineered version of the Intel 4116 DRAM chip, which roamed the Earth from the late 70s to early 80s.

In the West, versions of the Intel 4116 were used in legendary computers, such as the Apple II, ZX Spectrum, Commodore PET, and IBM PC – as well as in classic arcade machines like Defender and Missile Command. CPU Duke's sample from the Cold War-era USSR could have been plucked from a Soviet home computer – again, likely a clone of a Western machine. Contemporary Soviet embedded systems and industrial electronics would also use 4116 DRAM IC clones.

The Intel 4116 DRAM wasn't just available from Intel in the West. Electronics makers also often sourced these ICs from makers like Texas Instruments and Mostek. It is thought that the Soviet K565PY3 was reverse-engineered from a Mostek sample. Whichever model you might find, in used and salvaged hoards, these truly old ICs should be functionally identical.

You'd think cold plunging would be a straightforward task. Strip down to your swim suit, take a controlled breath, and calmly get into the freezing water to see how long you can last. But as with any wellness trend that purports to offer myriad physical benefits, there are important caveats to consider.

The experts suggest that launching yourself into a cold plunge pool at the right time can make all the difference to how you feel and how effectively you work out. It can also change, depending on what type of exercise you have planned. If you've invested in one of the best cold plunge pools, or simply want to make use of the ice bath in your local gym, here's what the experts suggest to gain the best results from your cold-plunge practice.

Immersing your body in ice-cold water may sound like a fun thing to do when you're too hot and on vacation in the Bahamas. But on a rainy workday in midwinter, it fast loses its appeal. When carried out responsibly, the practice of getting into water between 10 to 15 degrees Celsius (50–60 Fahrenheit) for one to five minutes after a workout can be very beneficial for some, however.

“Cold plunging can be done in a dedicated plunge pool, an ice bath, or even a cold, natural body of water,” says Mohammed Enayat, a general practitioner and founder of longevity clinic HUM2N. “While some people try it purely for the invigorating feeling, there is now solid scientific evidence that cold-plunging offers a number of health benefits. Studies have shown that cold immersion can reduce muscle soreness, support recovery post-exercise, stimulate circulation, and boost your mood by triggering the release of endorphins and norepinephrine."

Enayat also notes that cold plunging may also turn white fat into beige or brown fat, which is the “good fat” that burns calories and generates heat.

While these mind and body health benefits sound enticing, when you cold plunge matters, and it can have an effect on how successfully you train. It's also important to note that cold plunging isn't right for everyone. If you have heart or circulation issues, it can put sudden stress on your heart and nervous system. If you have any health concerns or are unsure whether you can cold-plunge, you should always consult your doctor before dipping into the ice.

The beauty of ice bathing is that you don't need to broadcast your plunge on socials to enjoy the process. You don't need an expensive gym membership either. For most, it can be easy to cold plunge from the comfort and privacy of your own home in a number of ways. Online, you can find plenty of dedicated cold plunge pools for use in or around your home and yard. CalmMax, Hydragun and Sun Home Saunas are just a few of the brands that sell easy-to-inflate pop-up cold-plunge pools with prices starting at $50.

You will have to pay a premium for designs with a dedicated filter that can also chill the water to a precise temperature, however. Otherwise, you'll have to make use of a cold tap and a few buckets of ice.

Another option is to fill your existing indoor bath up with icy cold water. If you're still wincing at the thought, turning the dial to cold at the end of your shower may be another route into experiencing some of the benefits of cold-water therapy. Shower company Mira launched a guided cold water digital shower, called the Mira Activate with ColdBoost. It comes with a selection of timed cold-water shower modes that incrementally lower the temperature of your shower to get you used to the process. It's surely only a matter of time before more bathroom companies follow suit and make it a standard offering in shower design.

If you've come across the term “contrast therapy”—the practice of alternating between hot and cold for the physical and mental benefits—you'll know it's fast becoming a popular practice in fitness circles at the moment. You move between the sauna, the hot tub, and either an ice bath or cryotherapy chamber.

While it has long been used in sports and physical therapy, there are now dedicated wellness centers that offer “contrast therapy routines,” with breath work, mindfulness, and red light therapy sessions thrown in for good measure.

But how do you do it on your own? Should you end on hot or cold? Do you still get the benefits if you immediately go into a hot tub after cold-plunging?

“The rapid change in hot and cold in contrast therapy stresses the cardiovascular system in a positive way and can improve circulation, recovery, and mental resilience,” says Gary Brecka, founder of The Ultimate Human. “But I always recommend ending on cold, as cold keeps your core temperature lower and prolongs the metabolic and hormonal effects. Going back to hot right after cancels some of that benefit.”

So should you cold plunge before or after a workout? It all depends on what type of exercise you've done and what your end goal is. The general consensus among fitness circles is that cold plunging is best done after cardio-specific workouts or at the start of the day, but not before a workout.

“Cold-plunging is best done after cardio or first thing in the morning, but not right after weight training,” explains Brecka. “Cold exposure before a workout can also reduce muscle temperature and blunt the body's natural signals for strength and growth. While post-cardio plunging can help reduce soreness and support recovery, doing it after lifting or before a workout may actually hinder muscle growth. That's because cold exposure can blunt the beneficial inflammation that triggers muscle adaptation and growth.”

If you do a strength training workout, Harrison Stevens, a performance specialist at the gym Third Space, suggests waiting six hours before cold-plunging. “If the main goal is muscle growth or tendon rehab post-workout, leaving some time before cold-plunging will allow the exercise-induced inflammation to settle,” he says. “If the workout was endurance-based, then there's no reason not to cold-plunge immediately, as it will improve recovery and your ability to go again tomorrow. After a cardio session, cold-plunging is the number one thing I want to do, as cold exposure also can spike dopamine, and it always feels great after a workout.”

There's something invisible that can put us in an early grave. And I'm not talking about sentient AI, but something much more ubiquitous and real. While AI doomers predict the existential risk that artificial intelligence poses to humanity, air pollution—specifically, ultrafine particulate matter, PM 2.5—has been an efficient killer for decades. Many people don't realize there are volumes of scientific evidence that link cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and brain damage to the growing list of bleak health consequences of bad air.

According to the World Health Organization, air pollution caused 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2019. As Trump's EPA continues to roll back standards and deregulate industries that cause air pollution, the burden of maintaining a safe breathing environment is increasingly falling on individuals. Luckily, there are some steps you can take.

PM 2.5, produced by wildfires, automobile exhaust, power plants, and industries like mining, enters the body through the nose and mouth through the simple act of breathing. Once inside the body, PM 2.5 can enter the bloodstream and the brain. Air pollution's impact on public health and life expectancy isn't novel. In 1970, 22 years after the deadly Donora Smog Event that killed 20 people and sickened over 6,000 in Western Pennsylvania, the Clean Air Act became federal law.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration repealed the Biden administration's new standards for air pollutants from taconite iron ore processing, exempting private sectors from complying, saying, “Preserving and enhancing domestic taconite processing capabilities … ensuring [the] resilience of American industrial supply chains.”

Taconite iron ore processing creates a major amount of PM 2.5. Trump's White House also repealed recent emissions standards for coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam, along with several other industries. As America's commitment to limiting air pollution declines, there are appliances and actions you can take to keep the air you breathe healthier, both indoors and outside.

When people think of high blood pressure, air pollution might not be what they envision. More often, stress, smoking, poor diet, or genetics might come to mind, but air pollution, PM 2.5, can cause and/or contribute to hypertension. NYU cardiologist Jonathan Newman, an expert on the link between the environment and cardiovascular disease, says that “in broad strokes, air pollution can affect cardiovascular risk factors, blood sugar/diabetes, blood pressure/hypertension.”

Invisible PM 2.5 reaches the deepest part of the lungs, entering the lung's tiny air sacs, where it passes through the barrier to enter the bloodstream. There, it can build up into plaque on the arterial walls, known as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. According to Newman, “Generally this occurs through direct effects of inflammation, neurohormonal effects, direct particle effects.” The interaction of PM 2.5 causes an imbalance with free radicals and antioxidants that puts stress on the body, causing inflammation and oxidative stress that leads to cell damage.

In other words, PM 2.5 can wreak havoc on the molecular level. The World Health Organization recommends that average annual concentrations not exceed 10 micrograms per cubic meter, with daily levels under 20 micrograms per cubic meter. Those guidelines are difficult to live by. A study found that “over 90 percent of the world population lives at PM 2.5 levels above World Health Organization standards.” The cheapest and easiest protection is to use a well-made N95 face mask. I carry an N95 mask with me at all times, as I cannot predict if a good-air day will turn into a bad-air night. The practice of carrying a just-in-case mask is one way to have agency over the air you breathe.

Newman was one of the coauthors of last year's study that found that “air pollution exposure has been implicated in the onset and progression of diabetes. Increased exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution (PM 2.5) is associated with increases in blood glucose and all forms of diabetes.” The findings are not new; in studies going as far back as 1967, researchers have found a link between high levels of PM 2.5 in ambient air (outdoor air) and an increase in diabetes deaths. And while there are other contributors to diabetes such as obesity and genetics, there is a link between the inflammation caused by PM 2.5 and diabetes.

While respiratory disease has long been studied as a negative outcome of air pollution, recent studies show that it also impacts the nervous system and brain development, linking PM 2.5 with stroke, changes in cognitive function, dementia, and psychiatric disorders. In particular, that fine and ultrafine particulate matter has an outsized impact, as it can be absorbed into the bloodstream to reach the central nervous system.

And how does this happen? One possible and terrifying way is through the olfactory nerve, the shortest nerve in your body, which enables us to smell. It goes from your brain to the upper inside part of your nose. To understand how something tiny like PM 2.5 can cause inflammation, a 2022 study reiterated, “PM 2.5 can pass through the lung-gas-blood barrier and the ‘gut-microbial-brain' axis to cause systemic oxidative stress and inflammation, or directly enter brain tissue via the olfactory nerve.” That PM 2.5 accumulates and results in oxidative stress (the free radicals and antioxidants have an imbalance), where it can “cause systemic inflammation and brain tissue damage.”

It isn't just the young that can be harmed by exposure to air pollution; a 2025 study found “long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of neurological disorders such as dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis, and cognitive impairment.”

There is, and will continue to be, a divide between those who can reduce the harmful health effects of poor air quality and those who cannot. Air quality monitors give real-time air quality index levels and guide decisions about opening windows, running purifiers, and masking. And the more people who use and share their data from outdoor air quality monitors, the more informed the general public will be. The use of indoor air purifiers that capture PM 2.5 is essential to well-rounded good health, and knowing how to use an air purifier properly is equally important. Understanding PM 2.5 and how to manage risk with masks, air purifiers, and air quality monitors is as much a part of staying healthy as eating well, taking prescription medicine like statins, and exercising.

I mean I'd probably say this for any cat story in politics; but this really does seem like a moment where the British media should be making serious attempts at facilitating a national discourse. The stats suggest something is going wrong in the political system that needs to be talked out. Just eyeballing the politics headlines I'm not convinced the Guardian has their finger on that pulse.[0] https://www.theguardian.com/politics[1] https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/keir-starmer-p...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_next_U...

That's news to me. And without advertising, sales and subscriptions have never covered the cost, and advertising has a strong effect on what is published, or more often, what is not. Belloc describes this in his book “The Free Press” [0].[0] https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18018

Lenovo just kicked off what may be the single most aggressive Black Friday laptop deal of the season, and the best part is that you won't even find it on Lenovo's own website. The company rarely slashes prices this steeply through its own direct channels to protect brand perception, but Amazon has the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 with a 13th Gen Intel Core i5-13420H, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and 512GB PCIe SSD for just $599: That's a massive 76% off the $2,499 list price, which makes this the all-time low price ever seen for this configuration.

See at Amazon

Meanwhile, Lenovo's site is showing zero Black Friday discounts on comparable models while Amazon is practically giving away this business-class machine at a price that undercuts most budget laptops with far weaker specs.

The Intel Core i5-13420H processor powering this laptop brings serious capability to the table: This chip rips through multitasking scenarios that would choke lesser processors, thanks to 8 cores divided between 4 performance cores (up to 4.6GHz) and 4 efficiency cores (up to 3.4GHz). Complementing the processor is 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and it is faster and more efficient than the DDR4 memory found in most laptops at this price. This means smoother performance when you are flipping from one application to another, faster data processing, and better responsiveness in general.

The 15.3-inch WUXGA display (1920×1200) offers more vertical screen space than standard Full HD panels which translates to less scrolling when you're working on documents, browsing websites, or reviewing spreadsheets. The IPS panel ensures consistent colors and wide viewing angles so that you are not stuck trying to find the perfect screen tilt to avoid color shifting. At 300 nits brightness with anti-glare coating, this display remains readable in bright environments like coffee shops with huge windows or outdoor places.

As for port selection, it's actually useful: you get two USB-A (5Gbps) ports, one USB-C that supports both USB Power Delivery 3.0 for charging and DisplayPort 1.2 for hooking up another monitor, HDMI 1.4 for presenting or adding more display real estate, a headphone jack, an SD card reader for transferring camera photos, and a separate power connector.

For $599, this Lenovo Windows 11 Pro laptop costs less than many inferior laptops that sport older processors, slower DDR4 RAM, smaller storage capacities, and dimmer displays. The 76% discount brings this business-class laptop down to a price point where it actually undercuts generic brands that can't match Lenovo's build quality or performance capabilities.

Dell just dropped one of its most capable laptops down to an absolutely absurd low price for early Black Friday, and honestly, it's hard to believe this deal is real. The Dell Inspiron 15.6″ laptop packs some serious firepower with a 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor (10 cores), 32GB DDR4 RAM and a spacious 1TB PCIe SSD. Normally listed at $2,549, it's now down to just $749 at Amazon for a 71% discount and an all-time low price for this configuration. The kicker? Dell's own website isn't offering any discount on this model, so Amazon is the only shot at snagging this deal.

See at Amazon

The 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U isn't your average mid-range processor: It boasts 10 cores split between 2 performance cores-each boosting up to 4.6GHz-and 8 efficiency cores going up to 3.4GHz which means it can handle heavy multitasking without breaking a sweat. That 32GB of DDR4 RAM backs up the processor beautifully and gives you enough headroom for demanding tasks. Mated to the 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD, you get boot times in mere seconds and plenty of room for all your work files.

The anti-glare coating and narrow borders of the 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen (1920 x 1080) make this laptop a real pleasure to work on for extended periods. Intel Iris Xe graphics handle everyday visual tasks, from smoothly streaming 4K content to light creative work and casual gaming. The display's narrow border design maximizes screen real estate without bloating the laptop's footprint so you get a spacious viewing area in a package that still fits comfortably in most laptop bags.

Port selection is generous: one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C, one USB 2.0, HDMI 1.4 for external displays, a headset jack and an SD card reader built right into the laptop. But Dell sweetens the deal further by bundling an 8-in-1 Type-C hub that adds even more connectivity: an RJ-45 Ethernet port, two additional USB 3.0 ports, SD and Micro SD card slots, another headphone jack, and a 4K HDMI port.

Windows 11 Professional comes pre-installed – in S Mode, though you can switch out of it free – giving you access to business features like BitLocker encryption, remote desktop capabilities, and enhanced security tools unavailable on the Home edition.

For $749, this Dell Inspiron laptop is less expensive than many budget laptops that carry far inferior specs, slower processors, half the RAM, and smaller storage capacities. The generic brands might tempt you with lower prices, but they rarely match the build quality, support network, and reliability that Dell brings to the table.

An analysis of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) indicates that nearly all adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) would have benefits that outweigh the harm from a systolic blood pressure target of <120 mm Hg compared with a target of <140 mm Hg. Thefindings will be presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025 November 5– 9.

In a benefit-harm trade-off analysis of 2,012 participants with CKD, investigators found that when predicting individualized treatment effects for multiple outcomesand simulating preferences for participants who view the benefits of intensive blood pressure lowering (reductions in death, cardiovascular events, and cognitive impairment) as much more important than treatment-related harms (such as emergency room visits or hospitalizations for acute kidney injury and fainting), 100% had a positive net benefit favoring intensive blood pressure lowering. When simulating benefits and harms to have similar, intermediate importance, 9 out of 10 still had a positive net benefit.

Compared with people with earlier-stage CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate(45–59 ml/min/1.73m2), people with more advanced CKD (20–44 ml/min/1.73m2) experienced more treatment-related harms from a lower systolic blood pressure goal; however, they also had larger benefits, which resulted in the more advanced CKD group having greater net benefits. The findings, which are consistent with KDIGO Guidelines that recommend a systolic blood pressure target of <120 mm Hg for adults with hypertension and CKD, could help patients and care partnersovercome therapeutic inertia that commonly occurs with intensifying blood pressure control in adults with CKD.

This study demonstrates that evidence about blood pressure targets from SPRINT can be personalized to adults with hypertension and CKD by using each individual's estimated risks and preferences for multiple outcomes related to bloodpressure lowering, which could help facilitate shared decision-making conversations."

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, initially developed to treat type 2 diabetes, have significant heart- and kidney- protective effects. In the kidney, SGLT2 reabsorbs approximately 97% offiltered glucose in the S1 and S2 segments of the proximal tubule, while SGLT1reabsorbs the remainder in the S3 segment.

In research conducted in rats, investigators found that dual inhibition of SGLT1 and SGLT2 more effectively reduces salt-sensitive hypertension and kidney injury than SGLT2 inhibition alone. The findings will be presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025 November 5–9.

Salt-sensitive hypertension-elevated blood pressure due to excess salt consumption- affects nearly half of individuals with high blood pressure and substantially contributes to kidney disease, cardiovascular complications, and progression to kidney failure. When researchers compared selective SGLT2 inhibition (through treatment with dapagliflozin) with dual SGLT1/2 inhibition(through treatment with sotagliflozin) in a well-established rat model of salt-induced hypertension and chronic kidney disease, they found that both drugs had profound effects on slowing the progression of salt-induced hypertension.

Compared with selective SGLT2 inhibition, dual SGLT1/2 inhibition produceda greater reduction in mean arterial pressure and more effectively attenuated kidney injury, although it had no impact on blood pressure under normal-saltconditions. Sotagliflozin also reduced body weight, enhanced urinary sodiumand chloride excretion, and nearly doubled fractional glucose excretion compared with dapagliflozin. Neither treatment altered kidney function. SGLT2 inhibition modulated several metabolic pathways in a region-specific manner in the kidney, with pronounced effects on lipid metabolism and inflammatory signaling.

Our study provides preclinical evidence supporting the expanded use of dualSGLT1/2 inhibitors beyond heart failure and diabetes, extending their potential into hypertension management, particularly in salt-sensitive patients."

Olha Kravtsova, University of South Florida

"These findings also establish a foundation for further investigation into regional kidney metabolism. Moreover, they highlight lipid and inflammatory pathways as promising therapeutic targets in the treatment of hypertension."

New studies from Arizona State University reveal surprising ways bacteria can move without their flagella - the slender, whip-like propellers that usually drive them forward. 

Movement lets bacteria form communities, spread to new places or escape from danger. Understanding how they do it can help us develop new tools to fight against infections. 

In the first study, Navish Wadhwa and colleagues show that salmonella and E. coli can move across moist surfaces even when their flagella are disabled. As part of their metabolism, the bacteria ferment sugars and set up tiny outward currents on the moist surface. These currents carry the colony forward, like leaves drifting on a thin stream of water.

The researchers call this new form of movement "swashing." It may help explain how harmful microbes successfully colonize medical devices, wounds or food-processing surfaces. Understanding how metabolism drives bacterial movement could help researchers develop new techniques to limit infections, for example by changing local pH or sugar availability.

"We were amazed by the ability of these bacteria to migrate across surfaces without functional flagella. In fact, our collaborators originally designed this experiment as a 'negative control,' meaning that we expected (once rendered) flagella-less, the cells to not move," Wadhwa says. "But the bacteria migrated with abandon, as if nothing were amiss, setting us off on a multiyear quest to understand how they were doing it.

It just goes to show that even when we think we've got something figured out, there are often surprises waiting just under the surface, or in this case, above it."

Navish Wadhwa, Arizona State University

Wadhwa is a researcher with the Biodesign Center for Mechanisms of Evolution and assistant professor with the Department of Physics at ASU.

The study appears in the Journal of Bacteriology. The paper has been selected by the journal as an Editor's Pick, highlighting the importance of the research.

When bacteria feed on sugars like glucose, maltose or xylose, they sometimes give off acidic by-products such as acetate and formate. These by-products draw water from the surface, creating currents that push the bacteria outward. Fermentable sugars are essential for this process - without them, the microbes can't move in this way. Sugar-rich environments in the body, such as mucus, may actually help harmful bacteria spread and cause infection.

When researchers added detergent-like molecules known as surfactants to the colonies, the bacteria stopped swashing. In contrast, surfactants did not affect swarming, a coordinated, flagella-powered form of movement that lets bacteria spread rapidly across moist surfaces. This suggests the two forms of movement use distinct physical mechanisms, and that surfactants that can be used to selectively suppress (or enhance) the movement of bacteria depending on whether they are swashing or swarming.

The fact that bacteria can colonize surfaces even when their normal swimming machinery is impaired has important implications for human health. Some microbes may spread by swashing across medical catheters, implants and hospital equipment. Blocking flagella alone may not be enough to stop them. Instead, we may need to interfere with the chemical processes they use to power this movement.

Both E. coli and salmonella can cause foodborne illness. Knowing they can spread on surfaces through passive fluid flows may help improve how food processing plants design cleaning protocols. And because swashing depends on fermentation and acidic by-products, strategies that alter surface pH or sugar availability could reduce bacterial colonization. The study showed that simple changes in acidity were enough to alter how the bacteria moved.

Something similar may also occur inside the body, where moist surfaces like gut mucus, wound fluids or the urinary tract create favorable conditions for bacteria. In these places, bacteria could use swashing to spread even when their flagella don't work well.

In a second study, corresponding author Abhishek Shrivastava and his colleagues looked at a type of bacteria known as flavobacteria. Unlike E. coli, these bacteria don't swim; rather, they navigate environmental and host-associated surfaces using a machine called the type 9 secretion system, or T9SS, which propels a molecular conveyor belt.

Normally, the T9SS helps these bacteria glide across surfaces. It does this by moving an adhesive-coated belt around the cell body, pulling the bacterium forward like a microscopic snowmobile. The researchers discovered that a conveyor-belt protein called GldJ acts like a gear-shifter, controlling the direction of this rotary motor.

If a small part of GldJ is deleted, the motor flips its spin from counterclockwise to clockwise, changing how the bacteria move. The study describes this molecular gearset in detail and shows how it allows bacteria to fine-tune their direction of movement, giving them an evolutionary edge in navigating complex environments.

Beyond enabling bacterial movement, the T9SS also has major implications for human health - serving both harmful and beneficial roles depending on the microbial community. In the human oral microbiome, T9SS-containing bacteria are linked to gum disease, where their secreted proteins promote inflammation in the mouth and brain, contributing to disorders such as heart disease and Alzheimer's. Conversely, in the gut microbiome, T9SS-secreted proteins can protect antibodies from degradation, thereby strengthening immunity and improving the efficacy of oral vaccines. 

Understanding how this gearbox works could help scientists design ways to block bacteria from forming slimy bacterial communities known as biofilms, causing infections and contaminating medical devices, but also harness its beneficial properties to promote health and develop targeted microbiome therapies.

"We are very excited to have discovered an extraordinary dual-role nanogear system that integrates a feedback mechanism, revealing a controllable biological snowmobile and showing how bacteria precisely tune motility and secretion in dynamic environments," Shrivastava says. "Building on this breakthrough, we now aim to determine high-resolution structures of this remarkable molecular conveyor to visualize, at atomic precision, how its moving parts interlock, transmit force and respond to mechanical feedback. Unraveling this intricate design will not only deepen our understanding of microbial evolution but also inspire the development of next-generation bioengineered nanomachines and therapeutic technologies."

Shrivastava is a researcher with the Biodesign Center for Fundamental and Applied Microbiomics, the Biodesign Center for Mechanisms of Evolution, and assistant professor with ASU's School of Life Sciences. The research appears in the journal mBio.

At first glance, the two discoveries - fluid surfing and molecular gear-shifting, seem worlds apart. But they share a common theme: bacteria have evolved multiple, surprising ways to spread. The more strategies bacteria have, the harder they are to contain.

The new findings also underscore the need for fresh thinking in combating bacterial disease. Many traditional approaches have often focused on targeting flagella. But as these studies show, bacteria can get around that limitation.

The research suggests that controlling the bacterial environment, including factors like sugar levels, pH and surface chemistry, may be just as important as targeting bacterial genes. And disrupting key molecular machines like the T9SS gearbox could prevent bacteria not only from moving but also from secreting the proteins that make them dangerous.

The number of adults living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has more than doubled since 1990, reaching nearly 800 million worldwide, according to new research published in The Lancet. The findings come from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2023 study, which tracked CKD trends among adults age 20 years and older across 204 countries and territories from 1990 through 2023. 

The study was led by researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, the New York University Grossman School of Medicine, and the University of Glasgow. Drawing on 2,230 data sources, the analysis offers the most comprehensive assessment to date of the fatal and non-fatal burden of CKD worldwide. 

CKD was the ninth-leading cause of death globally in 2023, claiming nearly 1.5 million lives, and the 12th-leading cause of disability. Unlike most other leading causes of death, the global age-standardized mortality rate from CKD increased, from 24.9 per 100,000 in 1990 to 26.5 per 100,000 in 2023. 

China and India, with some of the world's largest populations, have the highest numbers of people affected by CKD, at 152 million and 138 million. But the disease is widespread, with the United States, Indonesia, Japan, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, and Turkey each reporting more than 10 million adults living with CKD. 

"Chronic kidney disease is a growing global health crisis, yet much of its impact is preventable. Reducing deaths is essential to meeting the WHO target of cutting premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one-third before 2030," said Lauryn Stafford, co-author author and researcher at IHME. 

The study also highlights CKD as a major contributor to cardiovascular disease and points to the risk factors driving its rise. In 2023, kidney dysfunction accounted for almost 12% of global cardiovascular deaths, ranking seventh among risk factors for cardiovascular mortality, ahead of diabetes and obesity. 

The study identified 14 detailed risk factors for CKD, with diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity driving the greatest loss of healthy years of life. Dietary factors, such as low fruit and vegetable intake and high sodium consumption, also made substantial contributions. 

Chronic kidney disease is both a major risk factor for other leading causes of health loss and a significant disease burden in its own right. Yet, it continues to receive far less policy attention than other non-communicable diseases, even as its impact grows fastest in regions already facing the greatest health inequities."

Dr. Theo Vos, Study Senior Author and Professor Emeritus, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation

The rising prevalence of obesity and diabetes, together with global population aging, is driving a growing burden of the disease. In 2023, the global age-standardized prevalence of CKD was around 14% among adults aged 20 years and older. The highest prevalence was found in North Africa and the Middle East (18.0%), South Asia (15.8%), sub-Saharan Africa (15.6%), and Latin America and the Caribbean (15.4%). Countries with the highest prevalence included Iran, Haiti, Panama, Nigeria, Mauritius, Seychelles, Grenada, Mexico, Libya, and Costa Rica. 

In 2023, most people with CKD were in the early stages of the disease (stages 1-3). This highlights the importance of screening programs and risk-reducing strategies, including more accessible treatments to control blood sugar and blood pressure. These approaches can reduce excess cardiovascular mortality and delay the need for costly kidney replacement therapies in advanced stages of the disease. 

Because access to kidney replacement therapies including dialysis and transplantation remains limited and uneven worldwide, greater emphasis is needed on preventing disease progression and ensuring equitable care. Expanding access to diagnosis and affordable care, tackling key risk factors, and investing in strategies that slow disease progression will be essential to lessen the growing toll of CKD on patients, families, and health systems worldwide.

Scientists at Oregon State University have filed a patent on a design for a new magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent with the potential to outperform current agents while being less toxic to patients and more environmentally friendly.

The new material is based on a structure known as a metal-organic framework or MOF, whose development in the 1990s earned this year's Nobel Prize for chemistry as MOFs' many possible uses become increasingly apparent.

MOFs are made up of positively charged metal ions surrounded by organic "linker" molecules. They have nanosized pores and can be designed with a variety of components that determine the MOF's properties.

Researchers led by Kyriakos Stylianou of the OSU College of Science say their novel manganese-based MOF, which they named BVR-19, is a promising alternative to currently used contrast agents based on gadolinium. BVR is an abbreviation for beaver, OSU's mascot.

A contrast agent, also called a contrast medium, is a substance that enhances the visibility of tissues during medical imaging. Globally, the MRI contrast agent industry has an estimated value of more than $1.5 billion and is expected to grow by $750 million over the next five years amid rising demand for non-invasive diagnostic procedures.

Gadolinium is a rare earth element that comes with concerns regarding toxicity to patients, potential harm to the environment, and supply chain issues given that China accounts for many of the rare earth reserves and much of the processing and production capacity.

Manganese, however, is plentiful in the earth's crust. In addition to being used in making batteries, steel and ceramics, manganese is vital for human health in trace amounts, playing roles in antioxidation, bone formation and the metabolism of cholesterols, carbohydrates and amino acids.

"BVR-19 represents a paradigm shift in MRI contrast agent design," said Stylianou, who directs the OSU's Materials Discovery Laboratory, or MaD Lab.

We're replacing toxic metals with abundant, biocompatible ones, without compromising performance."

 Kyriakos Stylianou, College of Science, Oregon State University

Gadolinium has been used in contrast agents for nearly 40 years, he said. The body doesn't metabolize the contrast agents, so they pass nearly unchanged into wastewater systems and are resistant to degradation in treatment plants. Their long-term ecotoxicological effects not well understood.

There is also risk, Stylianou said, from gadolinium retention in the body. Most agents are designed to be excreted within 24 hours of administration, but even in patients with normal kidney function, gadolinium can stay in tissues for months or years. Retention hasn't been conclusively linked to disease, but the Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings and requires patient education because of uncertainty regarding long-term consequences.

BVR-19 is the first manganese-based MOF to incorporate L-cystine, a naturally occurring, biocompatible amino acid, Stylianou said. Its synthesis takes place in water at room temperature, no toxic solvents or other harsh conditions are required, and tests show that it allows for brighter, clearer images at lower doses than required of current commercially available agents.

"This work underscores OSU's leadership in designing functional MOFs for medical and environmental applications and demonstrates how green chemistry and materials design can converge to create safer technologies," he said. "It bridges chemistry, toxicology and medicine, showing how collaboration across disciplines can transform fundamental discoveries into technologies that directly improve human health."

Doctoral student Jacob Lessard and undergraduate Dylan Pyle were first authors of the study, which was published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry B. Other contributing members of the MaD Lab were postdoctoral fellow Andrzej Gladysiak, doctoral student Emmanuel Musa and undergraduate Jeff Bowen.

The collaboration also included Robyn Tanguay, Lisa Truong and Siva Kolluri of the OSU College of Agricultural Sciences and Cory Wyatt of Oregon Health & Science University.

Researchers from University of Jyväskylä have found that personalized interactive music systems – smart technologies that adapt rhythm and tempo to users' movements – can make exercise more enjoyable and help people stay active longer.

These systems, known as PIMSs, use real-time data from wearables and smartphones to adjust musical features such as beat, tempo, and style to match the user's pace – whether walking, cycling or lifting weights.

For example, when the systems detects you speeding up, it raises the music's tempo to match your energy – helping you stay motivated and in rhythm.

This new systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to examine how interactive, adaptive music can influence both exercise performance and emotional experience. Participants who exercised with adaptive music reported more positive feelings and greater motivation during their workouts - in other words, they enjoyed exercising more.

The findings also show that faster music tempos were linked with greater benefits, supporting the idea that matching music to movement can help sustain effort and improve performance.

Music has always been a motivator for movement. By personalizing it in real time, we might better support people in sustaining exercise routines."

Dr. Andrew Danso, Study Lead Author, Centre of Excellence in Music, Mind, Body and Brain, University of Jyväskylä

The review analysed results from 18 studies across Europe, Asia, and North America, highlighting the growing potential of adaptive music systems in making physical activity more engaging and sustainable.

The study suggests these technologies could play a key role in encouraging people to stay active - an important step in addressing global health challenges linked to physical inactivity.

New research reveals that contrary toconventional belief, primary glomerular diseases are not necessarily benign for children and young adults. In fact, some subsets of children and young adults may experience faster kidney function decline than older patients. The findings will be presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025 November 5–9.

Direct comparisons of outcomes between adult and pediatric patients with primary glomerular diseases are rare-including minimal change disease (MCD), focalsegmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy (MN), and IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Researchers analyzed data from CureGN, one of the largest longitudinal cohort studies of glomerular diseases. When they examined the rate of kidney function decline and the risk of progression to the composite outcome of kidney failure, ≥40% drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), or death, children and young adults had similar or even higher risks of meeting these adverse outcomes as older adults.

Pediatric patients with a biopsy-diagnosis of MCD had steeper eGFR declines compared with adult patients with MCD. MN patients aged 13–17 years and FSGS and IgA nephropathy patients aged 18–44 years at the time of biopsy had thesteepest declines in eGFR among their diagnosis cohorts. For patients with MCD, FSGS, and MN, no differences were detected among various age groups in the risk of progression to the composite outcome of death, kidney failure, or ≥40% eGFR decline, while IgA nephropathy patients aged 6–12 years, 13–17 years, and 45–64 years had lower risks of progression compared with those aged 18–44 years.

These findings suggest that young patients who obtained a kidney biopsy diagnosis of primary glomerular disease face significant risk of reaching kidney failure and requiring dialysis and / or a transplant in their lifetimes. We believe that future studies are needed to shed light on the lifetime burden and morbidity of primary glomerular diseases on patients diagnosed at a young age."

"Our research also highlights the importance of including children in clinical trials for disease treatment to mitigate against the adverse outcomes they face," added co-author Chia-shi Wang, MD, MSc, of the Emory University School of Medicine.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and OpenEvidence are entering a strategic partnership to accelerate the translation of cardiovascular clinical guidance and research into clinical implementation at the point of care. By combining ACC's leadership in cardiovascular science and education with OpenEvidence's advanced generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, clinicians will have access to the latest relevant and actionable medical evidence to support shared decision-making with their patients.

At the American College of Cardiology, our mission is to transform cardiovascular care and improve heart care for all because patients deserve care that's not only informed by the latest scientific evidence, but also delivered with confidence and compassion. Our collaboration with OpenEvidence will allow us to responsibly integrate AI into clinical workflows, ensuring that patients benefit from timely, evidence-based care without compromising safety, transparency or the trusted judgment of their clinicians."

Cathleen C. Gates, ACC Chief Executive Officer 

Through this partnership, OpenEvidence users will benefit from seamless access to trusted, evidence-based medical content curated by the ACC. By integrating generative AI-powered search capabilities, the platform enhances the clinical decision-making experience at point-of-care with both speed and accuracy.

"When we look at what clinicians are searching on OpenEvidence, the heart is everywhere: central to pathophysiology, and central to clinical decision-making," said Daniel Nadler, PhD, CEO of OpenEvidence. "From family physicians and emergency doctors to intensivists and trauma surgeons, clinicians across every specialty rely on the work of the ACC to guide evidence-based care. We're thrilled to partner with the organization that defines the foundation for cardiovascular practice, bringing their trusted expertise to the point of care through responsible, generative AI."

The creation of supplemental materials to support evidence-based treatment and care delivery is a major aspect of the collaboration. The ACC and OpenEvidence will convene an expert work group of cardiovascular clinicians to identify high-impact areas, frequently asked questions and assess knowledge gaps based on what clinicians are asking at the point of care. The work group will also explore opportunities to enhance the development of clinical guidance and the creation of new educational materials to optimize generative AI in practice.

An ACC/OpenEvidence AI Resource Center and podcast series are also in the works, exploring how AI technologies are shaping cardiovascular medicine. Additionally, the College will partner with OpenEvidence on the ACC Future Hub at the ACC Annual Scientific Session, providing attendees with frontline access to practice-changing technologies that can be used to optimize patient care and outcomes.

A new radioimmunotherapy approach has the potential to cure human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, according to new research published in the November issue of The Journal of Nuclear Medicine. The regimen, which pre-treats the tumor before delivering targeted alpha-radioimmunotherapy, resulted in durable major responses--including histologic cures--with minimal toxicities, paving the way for a safer and more effective treatment option for breast cancer patients.

Advanced metastatic breast cancer has a poor prognosis, especially for highly aggressive HER2-positive subtypes. HER2 is an oncogene that is overexpressed in 15-20 percent of breast cancers and is a clinically established therapeutic target. Although current HER2-targeted therapies offer improved outcomes, challenges remain because of treatment-related adverse events and tumor resistance to treatment.

Previous studies have shown that HER2-targeted radioimmunotherapy with the α-particle-emitting radionuclide 225Ac has been effective, but not safe, as alpha-particles were retained in the body, resulting in high toxicities. In our study, we used a pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) approach to directly treat the tumor and prevent potent alpha-particles from being absorbed in healthy tissues."

Sarah Cheal, PhD, assistant professor at Weill Cornell Medicine, New York

The radioimmunotherapy treatment approach consisted of a three-step intravenous regimen: first a bispecific anti-HER2/anti-DOTA antibody, next a clearing agent, and finally 225Ac-Pr radioimmunotherapy. Researchers began by testing the effects of 225Ac-Pr dosing during PRIT on tumor-targeting efficiency and tissue biodistribution in a BT-474 breast cancer xenograft model. The regimen was then evaluated in mice bearing the BT-474 xenograft or a patient-derived xenograft. The mice were treated with either one or two cycles of 225Ac-PRIT separated by one week. A dose escalation study was also performed on the BT-474 model to establish the nephrotoxic absorbed radiation dose.

In the BT-474 model, 100 percent of mice achieved complete responses and 85 percent achieved histologic cure. One-cycle and two-cycle treatments were equally effective. Treatments were well tolerated, with no chronic radiation toxicity documented. In the patient-derived xenograft model, a single 225Ac-PRIT treatment led to 60 percent complete response and prolonged survival versus no treatment. Lastly, researchers identified the dose in the 225Ac-PRIT regimen at which severe chronic nephrotoxicity was induced.

"This study illustrates the curative potential of 225Ac-PRIT as a treatment for highly aggressive subtypes of HER2-positive breast cancer," said Nai Kong Cheung, MD, PhD, member and attending physician in Pediatric Oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. "If successfully translated to the clinic, HER2-directed 225Ac therapy could offer new treatment options in breast cancer and other HER2-expressing solid tumors."

Iain Cheeseman and colleagues reveal the underappreciated role of single genes producing multiple proteins in atypical presentations of rare disease, and present case studies of affected patients through a collaboration with Boston Children's Hospital. The findings help to identify genetic mutations that may contribute to rare diseases.

Around 25 million Americans have a rare genetic disease, and many of them struggle with not only a lack of effective treatments, but also a lack of good information about their disease. Clinicians may not know what causes a patients' symptoms, know how their disease will progress, or even have a clear diagnosis. Researchers have looked to the human genome for answers, and many disease-causing genetic mutations have been identified, but as many as 70% of patients still lack a clear genetic explanation.

In a paper published in Molecular Cell on November 7, Whitehead Institute Member Iain Cheeseman, graduate student Jimmy Ly, and colleagues propose that researchers and clinicians may be able to get more information from patients' genomes by looking at them in a different way.

The common wisdom is that each gene codes for one protein. Someone studying whether a patient has a mutation or version of a gene that contributes to their disease will therefore look for mutations that affect the "known" protein product of that gene. However, Cheeseman and others are finding that the majority of genes code for more than one protein. That means that a mutation that may seem insignificant because it does not appear to affect the known protein could nonetheless alter a different protein made by the same gene. Now, Cheeseman and Ly have shown that mutations affecting one or multiple proteins from the same gene can contribute differently to disease.

In their paper, the researchers first share what they have learned about how cells make use of the ability to generate different versions of proteins from the same gene. Then, they examine how mutations that affect these proteins contribute to disease. Through a collaboration with co-author Mark Fleming, the pathologist-in-chief at Boston Children's Hospital, they provide two case studies of patients with atypical presentations of a rare anemia linked to mutations that selectively affect only one of two proteins produced by the gene implicated in the disease.

"We hope this work demonstrates the importance of considering whether a gene of interest makes multiple versions of a protein, and what the role of each version is in health and disease," Ly says. "This information could lead to better understanding of the biology of disease, better diagnostics, and perhaps one day to tailored therapies to treat these diseases."

Cells have several ways to make different versions of a protein, but the variation that Cheeseman and Ly study happens during protein production from genetic code. Cellular machines build each protein according to the instructions within a genetic sequence that begins at a "start codon" and ends at a "stop codon." However, some genetic sequences contain more than one start codon, many that are hiding in plain sight. If the cellular machinery skips the first start codon and detects a second one, it may build a shorter version of the protein. In other cases, the machinery may detect a section that closely resembles a start codon at a point earlier in the sequence than its typical starting place, and build a longer version of the protein.

These events may sound like mistakes: the cell's machinery accidentally creating the wrong version of the correct protein. To the contrary, protein production from these alternate starting places is an important feature of cell biology that exists across species. When Ly traced when certain genes evolved to produce multiple proteins, he found that this is a common, robust process that has been preserved throughout evolutionary history for millions of years.

Ly shows that one function this serves is to send versions of a protein to different parts of the cell. Many proteins contain zip code-like sequences that tell the cell's machinery where to deliver them so the proteins can do their jobs. Ly found many examples in which longer and shorter versions of the same protein contained different zip codes and ended up in different places within the cell.

In particular, Ly found many cases in which one version of a protein ended up in mitochondria, structures that provide energy to cells, while another version ended up elsewhere. Because of the mitochondria's role in the essential process of energy production, mutations to mitochondrial genes are often implicated in disease.

Ly wondered what would happen when a disease-causing mutation eliminates one version of a protein but leaves the other intact, causing the protein to only reach one of its two intended destinations. He looked through a database containing genetic information from people with rare diseases to see if such cases existed, and found that they did. In fact, there may be tens of thousands of such cases. However, without access to the people, Ly had no way of knowing what the consequences of this were in terms of symptoms and severity of disease.

Meanwhile, Cheeseman had begun working with Boston Children's Hospital to foster collaborations between Whitehead Institute and the hospital's researchers and clinicians to accelerate the pathway from research discovery to clinical application. Through these efforts, Cheeseman and Ly met Fleming.

One group of Fleming's patients have a type of anemia called SIFD-Sideroblastic Anemia with B-Cell Immunodeficiency, Periodic Fevers, and Developmental Delay-that is caused by mutations to the TRNT1 gene. TRNT1 is one of the genes Ly had identified as producing a mitochondrial version of its protein and another version that ends up elsewhere: in the nucleus.

Fleming shared anonymized patient data with Ly, and Ly found two cases of interest in the genetic data. Most of the patients had mutations that impaired both versions of the protein, but one patient had a mutation that eliminated only the mitochondrial version of the protein, while another patient had a mutation that eliminated only the nuclear version.

When Ly shared his results, Fleming revealed that both of those patients had very atypical presentations of SIFD, supporting Ly's hypothesis that mutations affecting different versions of a protein would have different consequences. The patient who only had the mitochondrial version was anemic but developmentally normal. The patient missing the mitochondrial version of the protein did not have developmental delays or chronic anemia but did have other immune symptoms, and was not correctly diagnosed until his fifties. There are likely other factors contributing to each patient's exact presentation of the disease, but Ly's work begins to unravel the mystery of their atypical symptoms.

Cheeseman and Ly want to make more clinicians aware of the prevalence of genes coding for more than one protein, so they know to check for mutations affecting any of the protein versions that could contribute to disease. For example, several TRNT1 mutations that only eliminate the shorter version of the protein are not flagged as disease-causing by current assessment tools. Cheeseman lab researchers including Ly and graduate student Matteo Di Bernardo are now developing a new assessment tool for clinicians, called SwissIsoform, that will identify relevant mutations that affect specific protein versions, including mutations that would otherwise be missed.

"Jimmy and Iain's work will globally support genetic disease variant interpretation and help with connecting genetic differences to variation in disease symptoms," Fleming says. "In fact, we have recently identified two other patients with mutations affecting only the mitochondrial versions of two other proteins, who similarly have milder symptoms than patients with mutations that affect both versions."

Long term, the researchers hope that their discoveries could aid in understanding the molecular basis of disease and in developing new gene therapies: once researchers understand what has gone wrong within a cell to cause disease, they are better equipped to devise a solution. More immediately, the researchers hope that their work will make a difference by providing better information to clinicians and people with rare diseases.

As a basic researcher who doesn't typically interact with patients, there's something very satisfying about knowing that the work you are doing is helping specific people. As my lab transitions to this new focus, I've heard many stories from people trying to navigate a rare disease and just get answers, and that has been really motivating to us, as we work to provide new insights into the disease biology."

Researchers have unveiled the intricate molecular mechanisms governing TCF/LEF-mediated transcription in the canonical Wnt pathway, identifying these proteins as promising therapeutic targets for cancer and fibrotic diseases. The review, published in Current Molecular Pharmacology, systematically dissects how four mammalian TCF/LEF paralogs-TCF7, LEF1, TCF7L1, and TCF7L2-achieve functional specificity through modular domain architecture and extensive alternative splicing.

TCF/LEF proteins function as the final integrators of Wnt signals, converting β-catenin activation into precise transcriptional outputs. Their regulation involves a complex interplay of co-repressors, chromatin remodelers, and post-translational modifications that we've only recently begun to understand in detail."

Yusuke Higuchi, co-author from Beckman Research Institute

The study reveals that Wnt enhanceosome components remain pre-assembled in a poised configuration even in the absence of signaling, enabling rapid response upon β-catenin nuclear translocation. Key regulatory mechanisms include TLE co-repressor clearance via UBR5-mediated ubiquitination, context-dependent TCF isoform switching, and phosphorylation by kinases such as TNIK and HIPK2.

Most significantly, the review documents the clinical translation of these findings. The TNIK inhibitor INS018_055, identified through artificial intelligence-driven drug discovery, successfully completed Phase II trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), demonstrating reduced lung function decline over 52 weeks. "This represents the first robust clinical validation that targeting TCF/LEF regulatory kinases can safely modulate Wnt signaling in humans," Higuchi noted.

While challenges remain in developing direct TCF/LEF binders due to their intrinsically disordered β-catenin binding domains, emerging PROTAC and AI-designed protein technologies offer new avenues. The study underscores the potential for selective TCF/LEF modulation to treat diverse diseases while avoiding toxicity associated with upstream Wnt inhibition.

DOHA - Canada played France to a scoreless draw Saturday to remain unbeaten at the FIFA U-17 World Cup.

The young Canadians are authoring a new story at the tournament after recording a dismal 0-20-4 record in eight previous trips. Canada ended that winless run in its opening game Wednesday, rallying for a 2-1 victory over Uganda thanks to an 88th-minute goal by Elijah Roche and 98th-minute penalty by Marius Aiyenero.

Uganda (0-1-1) mounted a rally of its own earlier Saturday, drawing Chile 1-1 on a 93rd-minute goal by Derick Ssozi.

Canada (1-0-1) stands second in Group K, trailing France (1-0-1) on goal difference, and is in good position to move into the knockout round for the first time at the tournament.

A win or draw against Chile (0-1-1) on Tuesday will assure the Canadians a berth in the round of 32. Canada could still advance with a loss, depending on the score, with the top two teams in each group plus with the eight best third-placed sides qualifying for the round of 32.

“I'm proud of the boys,” said Canada coach Mike Vitulano. “We went toe-to-toe with one of the top teams in the world and showed we belong at this level. We were ready, believed in ourselves, and played on the front foot.

“It is a solid performance to build on as our mindset shifts to preparing for an important match versus Chile.”

Canada's Tim Fortier was named player of the match.

France, which blanked Chile 2-0 in its opening game, won the U-17 title in 2001, was runner-up last time out in 2023 and finished third in 2019. The French, coached by Lionel Rouxel, qualified this time by virtue of finishing runner-up to Portugal at the UEFA Under-17 European Championship in June.

The expanded 48-team, 104-game FIFA competition runs through Nov. 27 across eight pitches at the Aspire Zone complex. The final will be staged at Khalifa International Stadium, which is also on the Aspire Zone site.

France outshot Canada 9-5 (5-1 in shots on target).

Vitulano made three changes to his starting lineup with Aiyenero, Shola Jimoh and Johnny Selemani, who all came in off the bench against Uganda, slotting into the starting 11.

The first half was essentially a stalemate with the only attempt on goal coming in the 36th minute. A Canadian turnover resulted in a chance for Jah-Mason Telusson but his shot was deflected to safety by Roche.

Aiyenero was booked late in the half which, coupled with a yellow card against Uganda, means he will miss the Chile contest.

The first shot on target, by French captain Abdoulaye Camara in the 48th minute, was easily handled by Canadian ‘keeper Jonathan Ransom. Camara, a 17-year-old midfielder, joined Italy's Udinese in July on a four-year contract from Montpellier. 

Canada sent on Aidan Evans and Van Parker in the 58th minute.

The subs had an immediate impact. Canada's first chance came in the 62nd minute when Evans' through ball found Parker streaking in towards goal. The ball ended up at the feet of Jimoh whose shot was blocked by sliding French goalkeeper Ilan Jourdren.

Ransom made a fine reflex save off a corner in the 72nd minute to preserve the tie. At the other end, Parker had a chance in the 80th but sent his shot over the crossbar.

Pierre Moungengue came close in the 83rd minute, dribbling around a Canadian defender only to see his shot bounce off the post. An unmarked Isaiah Bohui had a free header in stoppage time but sent it straight at Ransom.

That sent Venezuelan referee Yender Herrera to the pitchside monitor to check for a possible infraction in front of goal on the play. But it didn't lead to anything, much to France's ire.

The tournament's video support system allows coaches two requests per game for a video review. If the review by the referee results in the original decision being changed, the team retains its request.

Ahead of the tournament, Aiyenero, Antone Bossenberry, and Sasha Cernic were added to the roster with André Ali-Gayapersad, Owen Graham-Roache and Stefan Kapor withdrawing through injury.

The young Canadians booked their ticket to the World Cup in February, topping their five-team qualifying group — featuring host Bermuda, Anguilla, Curaçao and Turks and Caicos — with a perfect 4-0-0 record. They outscored their opposition 28-2 with both goals conceded coming from the penalty spot.

Spain's Pedri, Brazil's Neymar and Alisson Becker, England's Phil Foden and South Korea's Son Heung-min are among the world stars who have taken part in the U-17 World Cup.

DOHA, Qatar (November 8, 2025) – The U.S. Under-17 Men's National Team utilized goals from Nimfasha Berchimas and Cavan Sullivan on both sides of halftime to earn a 2-1 comeback win against Tajikistan in the team's second match of the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup. With six points from two matches, the result ensures the USA has clinched a place in the Round of 32 and can claim top spot in Group I with a win or draw in Tuesday's group stage finale against Czechia (9:45 a.m. ET; FS2, Universo, Peacock).

Heading into the affair, U.S. head coach Gonzalo Segares made four changes to the lineup that defeated Burkina Faso 1-0 in a tight matchup on Wednesday, inserting Luca Moisa, Cavan Sullivan and Mateo Tsakiris in midfield and Chase Adams up front.

It was Tajikistan that got off to a hot start, scoring in just the third minute. Intercepting a pass in the U.S. half and darting forward towards goal, Muhammad Nazriev ran onto a lobbed ball over the top from Mehrubon Odilzoda and finished with a powerful strike past ‘keeper Aidan Stokes to give the side a 1-0 lead.

For the first 25 minutes, the USA found it difficult breaking through the final third, as the opposing team employed a disciplined and compact defensive game plan after taking the lead. As a result, the U.S. concentrated much of its attack on the left side of the pitch, with the team looking to Mathis Albert and Cavan Sullivan to create chances.

After some promising looks, the U.S. finally found the equalizer on a corner kick in the 30th minute. Sullivan curled a precise in-swinging cross to the back post where Nimfasha Berchimas elevated himself and confidently nodded home past Tajikistan ‘keeper Rahim Rahmonov. Berchimas not only brought the USA level, but he also earned a place in history as the only U.S. player to score in two editions of the FIFA U-17 World Cup, having tallied three during the 2023 edition in Indonesia.

Momentum began to shift in favor of the Americans and a few moments later, Sullivan received the ball in the 18-yard-box and was able to fire off a shot on goal, but the attempt was saved by Rahmonov.

At the 43rd minute, Ramiz Hamouda played Sullivan on the left touchline who took a touch and struck a low cross into the box, allowing Chase Adams to slot the ball home. The go-ahead goalwas called back following a VAR challenge, as Adams was ruled offside when Sullivan struck the ball.

Play resumed and moments later the U.S. quickly moved forward again, with Adams finding himself on the receiving end of a floating cross, heading the ball towards goal only to have Rahmonov make a fantastic diving stop to deny the chance.

During first half stoppage time, the U.S. was inches away from taking the lead on two separate occasions having both attempts denied on the goal line. First, Adams had his shot blocked on the line and then Luca Moisa's attempt met the same fate, sending the teams into the locker room tied 1-1.

In a match where the USA outshot Tajikistan 19-2, Segares' side continued to dominant throughout the second half. Adams continued his strong performance early on, forcing himself into the box with the ball, creating enough space to get off a shot, but the ball was deflected and went out for a corner kick. After a quick look, Segares called for a VAR review for a potential handball in the box, but referee Tanguy Bemiame deemed that it did not occur, moving forward with the set piece.

In the 56th minute, Berchimas made a crucial run into the box and was fouled hard by Ramazon Bakhtaliev prompting the ref to blow his whistle and signal to the penalty spot. After a failed VAR request from Tajikistan head coach Marco Ragini upheld the penalty, Sullivan took the ball and showed no signs of pressure, coolly chipped his take straight up the middle to give the USA a 2-1 advantage in the 61st minute.

With the lead in hand, the U.S. was comfortable building up play from the back. In the 70th minute, the team bore the fruits of its labor, stringing passes together to put Mateo Tsakiris in position to strike from the top of the box where he curled his effort just wide.

In the 74th minute, substitute Jamir Johnson took on his defender coming from the left side and put the ball onto his right foot to fire a shot that careened off the cross bar and out for a goal kick. Six minutes later in the 80th, Moisa sent the ball to the back post for Sullivan, who nodded home a header, but the goal was called back for offside.The USA saw out the remaining minutes to ensure a well-earned 2-1 victory and a place in the Round of 32.

Cristiano Ronaldo and Joao Felix were on target as Al-Nassr comfortably thrashed Neom 3-1 to extend their lead over Al-Taawoun to three points at the top of the Saudi Pro League table. After a quiet second half, the floodgates opened with Gabriel's powerful shot before the Portuguese icon doubled the lead. Felix then scored the final goal to seal a memorable win for the Saudi giants. 

Al-Nassr and Neom played out an exciting first half, albeit goalless, as both teams had numerous chances to break the deadlock. Al-Nassr, of course, dominated proceedings with each of Ronaldo, Joao Felix and Sadio Mane coming close to opening their account in the game but they failed to keep the ball inside the goal.

Ronaldo possibly squandered the easiest chance of the half as he failed to keep his header on target from close range. Mane too missed a simple opportunity after miskicking the ball when inside the box.

The Saudi giants, though, did not take much time in the second half to open their scoring as in-form midfielder and ex-Chelsea star Angelo Gabriel broke the deadlock with a picture-perfect finish. In the 48th minute, Ronaldo took a free-kick from just outside the box, which was blocked by the Neom defenders but from the rebound, Gabriel scored with a brilliant grounded shot. 

Just seven minutes later, Neom were dealt another blow as striker Luciano Rodríguez was given his marching orders for a reckless challenge. The Uruguayan attacker was taking his position on the edge of the box to meet a cross from the left side when he intentionally elbowed an Al-Nassr player in the neck. The referee consulted the VAR before brandishing a red card. It was indeed a massive blow for Neom as they had already lost ex-Arsenal star Alexandre Lacazette in the first half due to injury.

Ronaldo soon completed his 953rd career goal after finding the back of the net from the penalty spot. In the earlier move, Ronaldo had seen his attempt saved from close range by compatriot Luis Maximiano but Joao Felix chased the second ball. The Portuguese forward tried to regain possession, but he was shoved from behind, which led to the spot-kick.

Ahmed Abdo pulled one back for the hosts in the 84th minute as Mohamed Simakan was caught napping. Abdo received the ball behind Simakan and comfortably placed it into the goal. Neom's celebrations were, however, short-lived as Joao Felix scored the third and final goal of the game to secure crucial three points. 

Ronaldo was once again on target as Al-Nassr extended their winning streak in the Saudi Pro League to eight games. The 40-year-old veteran star displayed a lively performance throughout the 90 minutes and also scored the team's crucial second goal from a spot-kick. 

Uruguayan striker Rodríguez was the main villain for Neom tonight as his reckless behaviour on the pitch led to his team being reduced to 10 men. Up until the sending off, Neom were fighting tooth and nail against the giants of the league, but his red card completely changed the complexion of the game. Rodriguez should have kept in mind that he was the team's last attacker for the night, especially after Lacazette's injury.

Matthijs de Ligt scored a 96th-minute equaliser as Manchester United managed to snag a 2-2 draw from their trip to Tottenham, snapping a run of four successive losses to Spurs. Thomas Frank's side trailed for much of the game but a late turnaround saw them close in on three points, only for Ruben Amorim's men to claw back at the very last and enact at least some sort of revenge after losing last season's Europa League final.

United went in front just after the half-hour mark. Spurs failed to clear their lines when playing inside their own box, and when the ball came back in courtesy of an Amad Diallo cross, Bryan Mbeumo slipped behind Pedro Porro to head in at the far post.

Tottenham nearly pulled level on the other side of half-time when Cristian Romero flicked on a Wilson Odobert cross, only for Senne Lammens made a fine save with his feet. Moments later, the Belgian threw up a strong hand to bat away a half-volley from Joao Palhinha.

Spurs had the ball in the net through Brennan Johnson but the flag was quickly raised for an obvious offside as the hosts continued to push for an equaliser. With only six minutes to go, United finally caved in. Odobert skipped past Manuel Ugarte with ease before teeing up Destiny Udogie to put in a low cross, which was received by Mathys Tel and finished on the swivel by the Frenchman.

What became a manic end to the game opened up for Benjamin Sesko to find a winner when slipped through by Mason Mount, but the Slovenian dawdled on the ball too long and was tackled at the last by Micky van de Ven. Sesko walked away from this challenge injured and had to hobble off, but as United had used all their substitutes, they had to finish the match with 10 players.

Entering six minutes of added time, Tottenham turned the game around completely. United couldn't clear from a Spurs corner, with the ball falling to Odobert on the edge of the box. The Frenchman curled an effort back in, which was flicked on by Richarlison and past a helpless Lammens.

Yet there was still time for one final twist. United won a corner, which sailed to the back post for De Ligt to nod over the line by a matter of inches and save a point. The result means both sides missed the chance to climb to second in the Premier League table before Manchester City's meeting with Liverpool on Sunday.

GOAL rates United's players from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium...

Senne Lammens (7/10):

Started off nervily by letting a pass from De Ligt roll under his foot and out for a corner but recovered well with a series of saves.

Matthijs de Ligt (7/10):

Had some early trouble watching Richarlison's marauding runs from the left, though the Dutchman quickly figured the Brazilian out in that regard. Saved the day with one of the most important headers of his United career.

Harry Maguire (7/10):

A rock at the back. Stifled Randal Kolo Muani before his half-time substitution and did the same to Richarlison afterwards. Withdrawn with a minor injury for Yoro. No surprise it all went to pot after his substitution.

Luke Shaw (6/10):

Protected by Dorgu so well that there was little on Shaw's plate to clean up, even despite Spurs seeing more of the ball.

Noussair Mazraoui (6/10):

Didn't need to worry too much about Spurs' threats on his flanks given how inverted they were on that side. Substituted for Sesko.

Casemiro (7/10):

Didn't offer a lot in possession but swept up well when needed. Replaced by the fresh legs of Ugarte, whose introduction effectively cost United two points.

Bruno Fernandes (7/10):

One of few players on the entire pitch who enjoyed getting the ball on the floor and spreading play. Grabbed the assist for De Ligt's leveller, with his menacing playmaking rewarded at the very end.

Patrick Dorgu (7/10): 

One of his better outings since joining United in January. Nullified Spurs' threats coming down his side and stretched play when in possession. Subbed for Dalot with United protecting the lead.

Amad Diallo (7/10):

Bumped up into the frontline from the off after rescuing a point in last week's draw at Nottingham Forest. Came up with the cross for Mbeumo's goal before moving to wing-back after Sesko's introduction.

Bryan Mbeumo (7/10):

Began on the left to accommodate Amad on the right. Was the subject of interest from Tottenham and former boss Frank over the summer, but only wanted United and it's a decision that is already paying dividends. Peeled away from Porro to break the deadlock and extend his fine run of form.

Matheus Cunha (6/10):

Started as the false nine, dropping into midfield to try and link midfield and attack. Showed flashes of his brilliance though that was about it. Taken off for Mount.

Benjamin Sesko (3/10):

Still adjusting to the pace of the Premier League, which became almost too obvious when he was both thwarted and injured by Van de Ven when in on goal. Walked back down the tunnel as United ended with 10 men.

Leny Yoro (5/10):

Didn't provide nearly as much authority and confidence as Maguire.

Manuel Ugarte (2/10):

Walked past by Odobert for the equaliser, played Richarlison on for Spurs' second. A cameo to forget.

Mason Mount (6/10):

Played in Sesko for United's chance to win the game.

Diogo Dalot (N/A):

The usual United scapegoat but the collapse was hardly his fault.

Ruben Amorim (6/10):

A real mixed bag. The starting XI did their job, but Amorim's substitutions nearly cost United any sort of result.

Invest Atlanta's Board of Directors have approved $925,000 in Tax Allocation District (TAD) funding to support local small businesses, the City of Atlanta announced.

The funding is part of the city's ongoing efforts to invest in Atlanta's small business community to ensure that “they can fully capitalize on major events coming to Atlanta, including the 2026 FIFA World Cup,” said a press release.

Included in the funding is $250,000 in Small Business Improvement Grants, which provides companies with up to $50,000 for various interior and exterior improvements, such as signage, lighting, storefront upgrades and code compliance repairs, to name a few.

Recipients of the grants include Bottle Rocket Fine Food & Beverage, Big Daddy's Kitchen, Crates record shop, Strikeout Wingz, and Subs & Salads Junction. 

“Small businesses are the backbone of Atlanta's economy, and these grants are one way we can help them grow and remain sustainable,” said Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, who also serves as the board chair of Invest Atlanta.

Another $500,000 will go into the “Small Business World Cup Opportunity Fund,” an initiative that will distribute microgrants to assist in the accelerated activation of vacant or underutilized small commercial spaces in downtown Atlanta, as well as create opportunities for small businesses in advance to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

In charge of administering the microgrants is Invest Atlanta's downtown community development partner, Central Atlanta Progress, a nonprofit whose goal is to bolster the economic vitality of downtown Atlanta, according to its website.

“Atlanta's small businesses are the heartbeat of our city,” said A.J. Robinson, president of Central Atlanta Progress. “By investing in them, we are investing in the character of our neighborhood — something that will be on full display during major events like the World Cup.”

In the spirit of the upcoming FIFA tournament, the remaining $175,000 funds will be used to construct a StationSoccer facility at the HE Holmes MARTA subway station. 

Once built, the development will offer free soccer programming and is slated to serve 200 players between the ages of 6-12, said a release.

Bryan Mbeumo has revealed his stance on a potential Cameroon national team call-up for the African Cup of Nations in December as the winger is determined to avoid the club vs country row. The AFCON 2025 kicks off in the last week of December, while the players are expected to link up with their respective national teams two weeks before the competition commences.

Mbeumo enjoyed a stellar campaign with Brentford in the 2024-25 season as he scored 20 league goals and provided eight assists in 38 matches and emerged as the Premier League's fourth-highest goalscorer. His impressive form for the Bees caught United boss Ruben Amorim's eye as the Portuguese coach splashed a whopping £65 million ($87m) to secure the winger's signing. Amorim identified the Cameroonian as a key part of his squad overhaul after overseeing a nightmare debut campaign at Old Trafford. 

The 26-year-old has so far had an impressive outing in his maiden season with the Red Devils as he has scored four goals and contributed with an assist in 10 league matches. Last month, Mbeumo recorded three goals and one assist, playing a pivotal role in United's turnaround after a sluggish start to the season. His all-action displays reflected both his maturity and tactical intelligence under Amorim, who has given the 26-year-old the freedom to attack from the right-hand side while drifting into central positions. It also helped him bag the Premier League Player of the Month for October. 

Mbeumo is expected to receive a national team call-up next month as Cameroon are all set to take part in the AFCON 2025. The tournament starts on December 21 and according to FIFA's international competition regulations, clubs must release players two weeks before the start of major tournaments to allow for preparation. United are scheduled to face Wolves on December 8, the day Cameroon are expected to begin their preparations. 

The Sun reports that the Red Devils will urge the Cameroon Football Association, led by legendary striker Samuel Eto'o, to allow Mbeumo to stay in England for the club's crucial fixtures against Bournemouth and Aston Villa on December 13 and 21 respectively. 

The report adds that Mbeumo is very clear about his stance on this potential conflict, as he is determined not to upset either his employers or his country and wants a clear agreement between all parties in the coming weeks.

Other than Mbeumo, United will also miss key first team figures like Noussair Mazraoui and Amad, who are expected to represent Morocco and Ivory Coast respectively, at the continental competition. Speaking about missing three of their star players in December, United boss Amorim said: "We will have time to suffer. We are going to struggle a little bit, but we already knew it's going to be an opportunity. When I watch the training, there are players that should be playing, but it's hard with one game to take some players from the team, because they are doing well also during the training in games. So other players are going to have the opportunity to help us. They are understanding the way we want to play, so if we are improving on that, the change of characteristics is not going to change the idea or the momentum of the team. But let's use Amad and Bryan in these games and we will see in general."

After a brilliant run of form in October, where they won three games in a row, something United had failed to achieve earlier in the Amorim era, their form somewhat took a dip as they were held to a 2-2 draw by Forest last weekend. Despite the draw, United have moved up to the eighth position in the Premier League table, courtesy of collecting 10 points in their last four games. They will now aim to get back to winning ways on Saturday as they travel to north London to face Tottenham.

With just under 20 minutes to go in the first Clasico of the current campaign at the Santiago Bernabeu, Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso made a double substitution with his side 2-1 up on Barcelona. Federico Valverde accepted his withdrawal with good grace. Vinicius Junior did not. Five times he incredulously asked "Me?!", to the understandable bewilderment of his manager. "Come on, Vini, damn it!," Alonso pleaded. But there was no calming the winger down.

"Always me! I'm leaving the team! I'm leaving!" Vinicius said as he walked off the field and straight down the tunnel. "It's better if I leave, I'm leaving." At this stage, that might well be for the best for everyone concerned, because Vinicius' shameful show of insubordination wasn't the least bit shocking. 

On the contrary, it was entirely in keeping with his combustible character, just another temper tantrum from a player that is now very much running the risk of becoming more trouble than he's worth to Real Madrid...

Not so long ago Madrid were willing to tolerate Vinicius' egotistical behaviour - and sometimes even support it.

The winger was utterly convinced he was going to win last year's Ballon d'Or and even brought up his seemingly imminent triumph during a heated exchange with Gavi towards the tail end of Madrid's 4-0 loss to Barcelona just two days before the ceremony in Paris. 

It was a rather revealing insight into his mindset. Vinicius clearly felt that boasting about his Ballon d'Or bid while his team were being humiliated on home soil by their most hated rivals was some kind of zinger; that individual glory was somehow more significant than collective failure in a team game like football. But the joke was on the Brazilian - because Vinicius didn't win the Ballon d'Or, and he took it very, very badly.

Even though Rodri made for a most deserving winner of the 2024 Ballon d'Or, Vinicius refused to attend the Manchester City midfielder's coronation.

Of course, not a single representative from Real Madrid turned up either. "It is obvious that the Ballon d'Or and UEFA do not respect Real Madrid," an unnamed source told AS. "And Real Madrid is not where it is not respected."

As hissy fits go, it was pretty hysterical, the unintentional irony almost overwhelming. Madrid and Vinicius felt disrespected - and yet it was they who had disrespected Rodri.

Still, at least a Ballon d'Or boycott was something that los Blancos could easily get behind. Vinicius' very obvious personality clash with Alonso is far more problematic for Florentino Perez & Co.

Alonso is a likeable leader - as Bayer Leverkusen double-winners would attest - but the Spaniard does not have anything like the same laissez-faire approach to man-management or team tactics as his predecessor as Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, whose father-like relationship with Vinicius and the other Brazilians in the Bernabeu dressing room undoubtedly played a part in the Italian's appointment as Selecao coach.

Consequently, the arrival of Alonso was always likely to ruffle some feathers at Real - at least initially - but that wasn't considered a bad thing. The feeling was that after a disastrous final season under Ancelotti, Madrid's superstars would benefit from less freedom and more structure.

Kylian Mbappe is certainly thriving under the new boss. The Frenchman won the European Golden Shoe last year, with 31 goals in 34 Liga games, but his strike-rate has actually improved this season, while there's also a greater dynamism about his all-round play.

Mbappe is now, without a shadow of a doubt, the leader of Madrid's attack, as well the club's poster-boy - which was Perez's plan all along. It's why he invested so much time, money and effort in convincing Mbappe to leave Paris Saint-Germain for Madrid.

The knock-on effect, though, is that Vinicius no longer feels as appreciated as he once did at the Bernabeu.

Vinicius' current contract expires in two years' time and it could yet be renewed. However, whereas an extension was considered a given as recently as last season, the forward's future is now shrouded in uncertainty - and Vinicius' strained relationship with Alonso is the reason why.

The first signs of tension between the two appeared during the Club World Cup, when Alonso informed Vinicius that he would not be starting the semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain, which did not go over well at all with the forward.

In the end, Vinicius started the game in East Rutherford - but only due to an injury to Trent Alexander-Arnold, and even then the 25-year-old was less than impressed at being deployed 'out of position' on the right wing. Vinicius nonetheless played his part in Madrid's strong start to the 2025-26 season. 

However, it quickly became clear that he was not happy with being occasionally rotated and regularly subbed by Alonso. With 13 minutes to go in the 2-0 win over Espanyol on September 20, Vinicius was replaced by Rodrygo. He responded by waving his arms around in disbelief before throwing a water bottle to the floor in frustration.

Vinicius and his entourage would likely disagree vehemently but he's actually very lucky that he has a coach as composed as Alonso, who has handled his childish conduct with the same kind of class he exuded during his playing days.

After the Espanyol outburst, Alonso pointed out that Franco Mastantuono, who had come off at the same time as Vinicius, was disappointed by his withdrawal too.

"Franco said to me, ‘Are you taking me off?' And I said, ‘Yes.' Something similar happened with Vini, but it happens to everyone," Alonso rather reasonably explained. "But I'm very happy with Vinicius' performance. The only thing he was missing today was a goal.

"It's true that he came off the pitch when he was feeling best, so I could have waited a bit to replace him, but I understood that we needed fresh players to maintain control. The schedule is demanding and we have to keep going like this."

When Alonso was pressed on the matter again just a couple of days later, he struck an even more empathetic tone.

"I've been a player too," he pointed out on the eve of his team's game against Levante. "When I was substituted, it wasn't always the nicest moment. So, [frustration], it's normal, it's natural.

"We talked about things after the game, as I like to be close to the players, and I won't make a big deal out of something small."

Vinicius, though, is evidently incapable of such restraint.

Vinicius' Clasico conniption was always going to cause a colossal amount of controversy. This wasn't Espanyol. It was Barcelona. In the biggest fixture in football. The whole world was watching, meaning everyone had an opinion.

Ex-Brazil international Luis Fabiano accused his compatriot of showing his replacement, Rodrygo, "a lack of respect", while former France international Christophe Dugarry spoke for a lot of people when he proclaimed himself tired of Vinicius' antics.

"He's always whining, he's always crying at the referee and at the opponents - he's unbearable now," Dugarry told RMC Sport. "You can be disappointed after being taken off, with your head down, grumbling, but insulting your coach, this is going too far.

"Have you ever asked yourself the question that if the coach doesn't play you, it's because your performances aren't at the right level? Get out, man, get out. Your performances are not up to scratch. He's still a long way from his level of recent seasons. He needs to reassess himself.

"He's a future Ballon d'Or winner, a leader of Brazil, one of Real Madrid's best. But he needs to show something else if he wants to be at the same level. Florentino Perez will get rid of him."

As for Steve McManaman, he was annoyed at Vinicius for overshadowing what was a hugely significant win for his old club. "We shouldn't be talking about someone getting substituted after 75 minutes. It drives me mad," the European Cup winner said on ESPN. 

"Because it's not about [Vinicius], it's about the team. It's about the collective. It's about winning. It is about going five points clear. It's about beating Barcelona after they beat you four times last year. It's about winning Xabi Alonso's first Clasico as coach." 

Vinicius wasn't without his defenders, though. Toni Kroos, for example, argued on his own podcast that "nobody can judge or imagine the emotion" that a player experiences during a Clasico played in front of 80,000 people. "In the cold light of day and with a bit of distance, he'll probably think: 'Well, I could have held back the anger a little longer.' As you can see in the images, it's not been conveyed in the ideal way," the former Madrid midfielder acknowledged. "Even so, I want to point out that it's an emotionally exceptional situation to be down there in a match like that."

Crucially, Vinicius' team-mate Dean Huijsen also leapt to his defence, with the Spain centre-back accusing the media of making "a huge fuss" out of a small matter. "He apologised, which I thought was fair, but he's an incredible team-mate, a really good guy, and it's no big deal. These things happen in football."

However, the issue with Huijsen's argument is that the apology was arguably even worse than the act itself. In his 98-word statement on his meltdown, there was no mention of his coach.

Vinicius basically said sorry to everyone bar the man he disrespected - and that was no oversight. The omission of even a reference to Alonso was very deliberate - as was the fact that the public apology was posted online on the very same day that The Athletic published a piece in which an anonymous source said that Alonso "thinks he's Pep Guardiola, but so far he's just Xabi."

Alonso, to his enormous credit, continued to rise above such underhanded attempts to turn this into a struggle for public approval between a player and his coach, preferring instead to praise Vinicius for his "valuable" and "positive" apology and draw a line under the matter. 

This affair is far from over, though, as underlined by ongoing leaks to the press, with AS reporting that Vinicius is now 'seriously considering' leaving Madrid, while BILD have gone as far as to claim that the decision has already been taken to sell the attacker at the end of the season.

It certainly wouldn't be a shock to see Vinicius make a long-mooted move to Saudi Arabia. His prime years may still be ahead of him but it's hard to see any elite European club meeting Real's rumoured €150 million (£132m/$174m) asking price.

Obviously, an awful lot could change between now and next summer - particularly at the Bernabeu, where a coach is never more than a couple of defeats away from a crisis. Still, Alonso is presently in a position of real strength, with Madrid top of La Liga, while Vinicius' hand has been weakened by his petulance and patchy performances (no goals or assists in his last five matches in all competitions).

He may still believe he's the best player in the world but he's not even the best player at the Bernabeu. As former France international Emmanuel Petit recently told JeffBet, Mbappe is the new "king" of Madrid and "Vinicius Jr is upset he's not being paid the same amount of money and the fact the team has been built around Mbappe. It felt like even Jude Bellingham was annoyed by Mbappe's arrival because he wasn't scoring as much, but that has changed recently. Everything has changed, in the media, in the changing room, the tactics on the pitch. Bellingham has been acting professionally and more intelligently in his communication than Vinicius."

Perhaps even more worryingly for Vinicius, there are a number of promising teenage talents in the Madrid squad capable of taking his place in Alonso's starting line-up, including Mastantuono and Endrick. Furthermore, if he were to be sold, the massive amount of money raised could then be easily invested in a star centre-forward (Erling Haaland, anyone?!) if Alonso wanted to move Mbappe onto the left wing.

The Blancos boss would never say such a thing in the current climate, of course. He's just trying to keep the peace for now, as he knows how valuable Vinicius could be to Madrid's hopes of winning major silverware this season.

However, Alonso has also acknowledged that for Vinicius to reproduce his very best form, "He has to feel important and comfortable." Right now, he clearly feels neither, meaning the next time he threatens to leave, Madrid might well usher him out the door.

FIFA has officially announced the nominees for The Best 2025, recognizing the standout footballers from the 2024/25 campaign. For the first time, performances at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, held in the United States, were included as part of the evaluation criteria. 

A move that boosted the visibility of Brazilian clubs and helped the South American nation top the list with 11 players nominated for the Team of the Season. Portugal follows with 10, while France and Spain has eight representatives each one.

Brazil features players in almost every position, led by Raphinha, who's also in contention for the Best Men's Player award, and a remarkable showing among goalkeepers: four nominees in total. 

+ Premier League becomes Ancelotti's main source for Brazil squad

Raphinha (Barcelona) – Best Player & Team of the Season

Raphinha enjoyed his most complete campaign since joining Barcelona. With pace, flair, and sharp decision-making, he played a key role in their LaLiga and Copa del Rey triumphs, while also shining in the Champions League.

Alisson (Liverpool) – Best Goalkeeper & Team of the Season

Liverpool's ever-reliable shot-stopper was once again outstanding in 2024/25. A cornerstone of the Premier League title-winning side, Alisson pulled off match-winning saves against Arsenal and Chelsea, while maintaining top form in Europe.

Fábio (Fluminense) – Team of the Season

At 44 years old, Fábio continues to defy time. The veteran was crucial in Fluminense's 2023 Copa Libertadores triumph, which secured their spot at the 2025 Club World Cup. In the tournament, his calm under pressure and decisive saves — including a man-of-the-match performance — proved why experience still matters.

Weverton (Palmeiras) – Team of the Season

A model of consistency, Weverton was pivotal in Palmeiras' strong Libertadores and Brasileirão campaigns. His reflexes, command of the box, and leadership helped keep the side competitive on all fronts — earning him yet another nod among the continent's best.

John (Botafogo / Nottingham Forest) – Team of the Season

John's year was one of breakthroughs. He starred for Botafogo, anchoring the defense during their Brazilian League and Libertadores title runs, before earning a midseason move to Nottingham Forest. His rise reflects the new generation of Brazilian goalkeepers making their mark abroad.

Thiago Silva (Fluminense) – Team of the Season

Back home at Fluminense, Thiago Silva proved that class truly is timeless. At 40, the veteran center-back was the defensive pillar that led the team to a Club World Cup semifinal.

His composure, positioning, and leadership against elite opposition reaffirm his status as one of the great defenders of the modern era.

+ Sons of Cristiano Ronaldo, Thiago Silva and other football stars begin to shine

Marquinhos (Paris Saint-Germain) – Team of the Season

The PSG captain delivered yet another season of excellence — winning Ligue 1 and finally lifting the long-awaited Champions League trophy. Solid, composed, and ever-reliable, Marquinhos defensive awareness and leadership continue to set the standard at the highest level.

Gabriel Magalhães (Arsenal) – Team of the Season

Dominant in both league and European matches, his performances against top-six rivals cemented his reputation as one of the Premier League's finest defenders.

Vinicius Junior (Real Madrid) – Team of the Season

Although not as dazzling as in the 2023/24 campaign, the Brazilian star remained one of Real Madrid's top performers, showcasing trademark dribbles and flashes of brilliance. 

Luiz Henrique (Botafogo/Zenit) – Team of the Season

With flair and fearless dribbling, Luiz Henrique was the creative spark behind Botafogo's 2024 Libertadores triumph, earning him the “Rei da América” (King of America) award. 

João Pedro (Brighton / Chelsea) – Team of the Season

The breakout Brazilian of the Premier League season, João Pedro dazzled for Brighton before maintaining form after a big move to Chelsea. Sharp in front of goal and decisive in key clashes, he played a major role in his club's Club World Cup title in the U.S., showcasing Brazil's new attacking generation.

The FIFA The Best 2025 Awards ceremony will take place in Zurich this December, and anticipation is sky-high for Brazilian fans.

In last year's edition, Vinícius Júnior stole the show, winning The Best 2024 Men's Player Award after a spectacular season with Real Madrid.

Instrumental in both the Champions League and Club World Cup triumphs, Vini's goals and flair. Especially in the final against Borussia Dortmund.

+ Brazil and the Ballon d'Or: All the Winners and the Ongoing Drought

The selection process for The Best 2025 unfolds in two stages. First, panels of experts — one for men's football and another for women's — draw up the shortlist. Then, a public vote on FIFA's official website (open until November 28) determines the three finalists in each category.

In the final phase, national team coaches and captains from FIFA's 211 member associations, selected journalists, and fans worldwide cast their votes. The weighted average of these four groups decides the winners across all categories.

The final pathways to the game-changing FIFA World Cup 2026™ will be mapped out when the draw for the FIFA World Cup 2026™ Play-Off Tournament and the European Play-Off draw take place at the Home of FIFA in Zurich, Switzerland, on Thursday, 20 November 2025.

New Caledonia will represent the OFC at the six-nation FIFA World Cup 26™ Play-Off Tournament and will soon learn who they will face in pursuit of their first-ever FIFA World Cup™ appearance. Their place in the tournament was secured after reaching the final of the FIFA World Cup 26™ Oceania Qualifiers against New Zealand.

The draws will define the routes the 22 competing nations – six via the Play-Off Tournament and 16 through European Play-Off matches – will need to successfully navigate to seal a spot at the first-ever 48-team FIFA World Cup™, which will be staged in Canada, Mexico and the United States from Thursday, 11 June to Sunday, 19 July 2026.

The draws will be staged back-to-back, with the draw for the FIFA World Cup 2026 Play-Off Tournament commencing at 13:00 CET, followed by the European Play-Off equivalent.

The draws will take place just two days after the completion of the November 2025 international match window, which promises to be another action-packed period as the list of qualified nations for the 23rd edition of the FIFA World Cup continues to take shape.

Twenty-eight teams have already booked their places at next year's historic tournament, with a further 14 nations – three from Concacaf and 11 from UEFA – set to punch their tickets to the finals via confederation qualifying this month.

The November international window will also define which teams from the AFC, CAF and Concacaf will join Bolivia (CONMEBOL) and New Caledonia (the OFC) at the six-nation FIFA Play-Off Tournament, as well as the 16 countries that will compete in the European Play-Offs, during the international match window from 23 to 31 March 2026.

The FIFA Play-Off Tournament will feature two finals where the winners of the two semi-finals between the unseeded teams will face the two seeded teams, with the eventual winners securing two spots at the FIFA World Cup 2026.

The European Play-Offs will be made up of 12 group runners-up and the four best-ranked UEFA Nations League section winners. The 16 teams who enter will be drawn into four play-off paths, with four teams in each. Play-off matches will be played in single-leg semi-finals followed by single-leg finals to decide Europe's final four FIFA World Cup 2026 participants.

To ensure both draws can be conducted in accordance with the relevant draw procedures, the next edition of the FIFA/Coca-Cola Men's World Ranking will be published on Wednesday, 19 November 2025.

Fans around the world will be able to follow the draws live on FIFA.com, FIFA+ and via FIFA media partners. Further details, including additional broadcast information, will be published on FIFA.com in due course.

Christian Pulisic could be good to go for AC Milan this weekend.

The U.S. men's national team star wasn't named to coach Mauricio Pochettino's squad for two upcoming friendlies, but he could be on the pitch for Massimiliano Alegri's side for Saturday's Serie A game against Parma. 

Pulisic has been hampered by a right hamstring injury since exiting the first half of the U.S. men's national team's 2-1 win over Australia on Oct. 17. But Allegri said the 27-year-old winger could be ready for action.

"We've got Pulisic back, who is doing well and available to play," Allegri said.

Pulisic was not named on Pochettino's roster for the USMNT's friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay on Nov. 15 and Nov. 18. Pochettino said he wanted Pulisic to remain in Italy with his club and "to provide him the possibility to recover 100%."

Pulisic has been in incredible form for Milan, scoring six goals in eight appearances in all competitions. The Rossoneri are in third place in the Serie A standings, just one point behind defending champions Napoli.

As well as providing an update on Pulisic, Allegri also said that Mexico striker Santiago Gimenez and French midfielder Adrien Rabiot would be fit to return from their injuries following the November international break.

The Herons might miss the Uruguayan when they take on Nashville Saturday night, yet his absence could offer some answers as to how they function going forward

Luis Suarez just had to do it again. In fairness, this is what Luis Suarez does: mayhem, chaos, rule-breaking - and often in rather nasty ways.

His latest act? Kicking Nashville's Andy Najar in the groin during the second half of Inter Miami's playoff clash. It was the kind of thing Suarez has probably gotten away with countless times - a ball about to enter the box, Najar holding him, Suarez pushing off and flicking his leg with a quick, snapping motion.

Whether he intended to plant his studs in the defender's groin isn't clear - that would require a frightening degree of accuracy, a no-look shot for the ages. But the broader point holds: Suarez made a deliberate act to injure an opponent. Few caught it in real time, and there was no punishment on the pitch, but MLS reviewed the play afterward and handed him a one-match suspension. He'll now miss Saturday's elimination game against Nashville - if Miami lose, their season ends, and Suarez won't be on the pitch to help them.

Perhaps more importantly, though, this is a test for the Herons. They have survived without Suarez in the past. They have, arguably, looked better without him at times. And so, it becomes a strange balancing act. Suarez is a key player, to be sure. But they have shown previously that his absence isn't necessarily damning. And this game - win or lose - might just offer an idea of how a post-Suarez Inter Miami could function, not just in the next few weeks, but also for years to come. 

Of course, this was bound to happen. Every few months, Suarez reminds the footballing world why he's one of the game's great villains - an immense talent, but a truly unlikeable one. This is the Suarez brand: brilliance wrapped in chaos. The contradiction is that what makes him great - the tenacity and relentlessness - also fuels the misdemeanors. In a twisted way, good and evil Suarez must coexist for elite Suarez to thrive.

At his best, Suarez remains an unrelenting pest of a forward, even in his twilight years. He keeps running, shouting, and scrapping long after his body tells him not to. Everything about his 38-year-old frame - the worn knees, the heavy legs - suggests his career should be over. Yet somehow, he's still fighting on. That persistence doesn't justify the occasional kick or outburst; it's simply part of who he is (and still shouldn't be condoned).

These incidents are forgivable when Suarez is fit and firing. But when he's off color? Then they start to seem a real issue. He has already been suspended once this season, that time for spitting at a Seattle Sounders staff member after losing the Leagues Cup final. He was banned for three games and should have been out for longer. And now, Suarez is out again.

The immediate issue here - beyond that, of course, of having an aging superstar with serious anger issues - is how Miami approach Game 3. Suarez is having a poor season by his standards, with 10 goals and 10 assists in MLS. He is not the goalscoring threat he once was, but remains an influential part of the Miami attack. It's a footballing cliche of sorts, but Suarez makes all of the intelligent runs and occupies all of the right spaces. Strikers of his age are supposed to conserve energy and only move when they absolutely have to. Suarez is hardly ever static. Even when he is less effective in front of goal or slower getting to his spots on the pitch, he remains a nightmare for defenders. 

Miami don't have the personnel to replace him or his impact. What they will have to do, then, is some tactical tweaking. The silver lining to having a player who gets suspended a lot is that you tend to learn how to operate without him when needed. And Miami have done so on a couple of occasions this season. The most obvious solution is a tried and tested formula that has worked for 15 years: play Lionel Messi as a false nine. It worked wonders for Barcelona, and Argentina have done a similar thing for years.

That might, in fact, be the only option for the Herons. Young striker Allen Obando has hardly played all season. Tadeo Allende is a peripheral option. Messi, who is the team's best attacking player and playmaker, appears to be the most logical choice. 

But there will undoubtedly be a bit of a knock-on effect - at both ends of the pitch. Although they started the season in a 4-3-3, recently, Miami have played in a more recognizable 4-4-2. Suarez operates as a central striker of sorts, with Messi able to roam around in a free role just behind him. That makes perfect sense from an attacking point of view. It allows the outside players to get forward and scamper into good crossing positions, which then opens some space for Messi in the middle. This isn't tactically revolutionary as much as basic soccer.

When you don't have a central striker, though, things change. The concept of the false nine is inherently reliant on having two attacking outside players who pour forward and sacrifice a little bit defensively. It's almost counterintuitive, but playing without a natural forward tends to be far more offensive of a setup - mostly because it can leave teams frighteningly exposed when they don't have the ball.

Anyone who has watched Miami at any point this season would tell you that is not a very good idea. They're a pretty simple team to cut through, offering far too much space in the middle of the pitch, and limited pressure on the ball when they don't have it. The appeal of a 4-4-2, rather than a 4-3-3, is that it offers a more reliable defensive structure that is harder to play against. Effectively, then, in losing Suarez, Miami will be forced to leave themselves a little more open going the other way. 

Suarez is a real pain, but his presence alone makes Miami better - at least in theory. Without him in August, they were mixed: narrow wins over Seattle and D.C. United, but a 3-0 thrashing by Charlotte that exposed their flaws.

That game was perhaps more indicative of how Miami can be attacked than the two wins. Charlotte had far less of the ball, and were comfortable in their defensive shape. They kept Messi quiet, and were incredibly direct and opportunistic when they had the ball. They managed four shots on target, and three ended up in the back of the net. That is, perhaps, a bit of a statistical anomaly. But it is indicative of how Miami can be hit when they're without Suarez. That could easily happen against Nashville Saturday night. 

More broadly, it could offer some indications about Miami's future. Messi's under contract for multiple years, but Suarez's deal ends after this season. Despite Jorge Mas' hints that the Uruguayan could stay, there's been no public indication of renewal. There is every chance that he has played his last game for Miami. Now, the Herons have to figure out how to move forward without him.

 With the Green Art Wall Project, the Nitto ATP Finals has become inextricably linked to the city of Turin. A mural that promotes sustainability and respect for the environment, it is an artistic creation that, in addition to contributing to urban regeneration, helps to improve air quality. 

 The project, born from the collaboration between the Nitto ATP Finals, the tournament's title partner Nitto, and with the support of the city of Turin, places particular emphasis on the theme of CO₂ reduction, both in the subject matter and in the construction of the work itself. The mural has been created using special Airlite paints capable of purifying the air and concretely contributing to the improvement of the surrounding environment. 

 This work forms part of a broader initiative, the Nitto ATP Finals Torino Green Project, launched in 2023 to promote sustainability and innovation in the city of Turin.

 The Green Art Wall is an expression of gratitude from the Nitto ATP Finals towards the citizens of Turin: a legacy that the event leaves to the city, marking the culmination of its first five-year presence in Turin. 

 The mural, created by the Turin-based artist MrFijodor and hosted on the wall of the Istituto Comprensivo Leone Senigaglia, tells the story of the connection between sustainability and tennis, a bond founded on shared values such as commitment, growth, and respect. The choice of a school, a symbolic place of learning and the future, represents an additional source of pride for all partners involved. 

 The creation of the mural will accompany the entire duration of the Nitto ATP Finals and will be completed on 16 November, when the artist will sign the work, making it officially part of the cultural heritage of the city of Turin.

It all comes down to Saturday in Riyadh. Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina square off in the singles final, while Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens take on Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani for the doubles crown. From paths to the final to prize money and start times, here's what to know on championship day.

It all comes down to this. The championships of the WTA Finals Riyadh are here to put a bow on the Hologic WTA Tour's crown-jewel event and the 2025 season.

Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina, both unbeaten and seeking their first WTA Finals title, take center stage as they vie for the Billie Jean King Trophy. In doubles, Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens square off against Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani with the Martina Navratilova Trophy on the line. 

The doubles final begins the slate at 4 p.m. local time, and the singles final will begin at 7 p.m. The respective trophy presentations will be held immediately after each match. 

Below is a breakdown of the two finals scheduled for Saturday: 

Note: All matches are local time.

Prize money: Because the singles finalists are coming into this match undefeated, the champion will take home $5.23 million, the largest payout in women's sports history.

The doubles finalists each lost in the round-robin stage, so the champions will make $1.06 million. (An undefeated team would have won $1.13 million.)

The Case for Kudermetova-Mertens: After knocking out top seeded Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini in their final round robin match, Kudermetova and Mertens took down No. 2 Siniakova and Townsend -- and last year's runner-up -- to reach the final. Since falling in their group stage opener, they've won three straight matches. 

Their one meeting against Babos-Stefani came in the first round of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia. Kudermetova-Mertens cruised to a 6-4, 6-2 win, kickstarting their run to the final.

Like Babos, Kudermetova and Mertens are also previous champions of the crown-jewel event. Three years ago, the duo lifted the trophy in Fort Worth, Texas in an undefeated run to the title. 

Road to the Final:• 1. Loss to Hsieh-Ostapenko 6-1, 5-7, [5-10]• 2. Win over Muhammad-Schuurs 6-4, 6-7 (6), [10-6]• 3. Win over Errani-Paolini 6-3, 6-3• SF: Win over Siniakova-Townsend 4-6, 7-6 (6), [10-6]• Accrued prize money: $543,000

The Case for Babos-Stefani: Since falling in their group stage opener, Babos-Stefani have been on a tear, winning three straight matches. In the semifinals they took down the previously undefeated Hsieh Su-Wei and Jelena Ostapenko, coming back from a break down in each set and needing three match points to secure the victory. 

Babos-Stefani seek to avenge that defeat in Rome in May, but the loss propelled a title run in Strasbourg the following tournament. They defeated Mertens in Stuttgart, though the Belgian was competing with Chan Hao-ching. 

For Babos, this would mark the Hungarian's fourth WTA Finals doubles title and first since capturing three straight from 2017-2019. Stefani, in her maiden WTA Finals appearance, is the first Brazilian to reach the final in the tournament's history. A win on Saturday would secure their fifth title of the season. 

Road to the Final:• 1. Loss to Siniakova-Townsend 6-2, 3-6, [10-6]• 2. Win over Andreeva-Shnaider 7-5, 2-6, [10-7]• 3. Win over Dabrowski-Routliffe 2-6, 7-5, [10-5]• SF: Win over Hsieh-Ostapenko 6-4, 7-6 (5)• Accrued prize money: $543,000

Head to Head: Sabalenka leads 8-5

The Case for Sabalenka: The World No. 1 is just one win away from her first WTA Finals title in her fifth appearance at the event. 

A perfect 4-0 thus far in Riyadh, she's earned her spot in Saturday's final after a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 semifinal thriller against Anisimova, and returns to the final for the first time since 2022. She also ended Anisimova's 13-match win streak in three-set matches.

Standing between Sabalenka and that coveted title is Rybakina, who Sabalenka defeated twice in 2025. She most recently knocked out Rybakina in the quarterfinals in Wuhan, winning 6-3, 6-3 win. She also won in the quarterfinals in Berlin back in June. 

Sabalenka, who won the US Open and reached the Australian Open and Roland Garros finals, is the first player to reach the WTA Finals championship and three Grand Slam singles finals in the same season since Angelique Kerber in 2016. She also defeated each of this year's Grand Slam champions at least once in 2025.

Road to the Final:• 1. Win over Paolini 6-3, 6-1• 2. Win over Pegula 6-4, 2-6, 6-3• 3. Win over Gauff 7-6 (5), 6-2• SF: Win over Anisimova 6-3, 3-6, 6-3• Accrued prize money: $2.695 million

The Case for Rybakina: The 26-year-old is one win away from a perfect 5-0 campaign in Riyadh and closing 2025 on an 11-match winning streak. This would also be her first WTA Finals title. 

Pegula certainly tested Rybakina in the semifinals, taking the first set in a two-hour, five-minute thriller. But Rybakina bounced back, and her 15 total aces, five break points and 36 winners helped her overcome 67 unforced errors. Rybakina's game has been the most complete in Riyadh from the serve to the return to the ability to cover the court, and that will need to be on full display in the final. 

Rybakina's final test is the world's best in Sabalenka. Though she trails the head to head, she did defeat Sabalenka in Cincinnati in August. She also beat Sabalenka 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 in the group stage in Riyadh last year. 

The former Wimbledon champion is seeking her 45th hard-court win of 2025, the most of any player on tour. 

Road to the Final:• 1. Win over Anisimova 6-3, 6-1• 2. Win over Swiatek 3-6, 6-1, 6-0• 3. Win over Alexandrova (playing as an alternate after Keys withdrew) 6-4, 6-4• SF: Win over Pegula 4-6, 6-4, 6-3• Accrued prize money: $2.695 million

It all comes down to Saturday in Riyadh. Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina square off in the singles final, while Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens take on Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani for the doubles crown. From paths to the final to prize money and start times, here's what to know on championship day.

Either Sabalenka or Elena Rybakina will take home $5.235 million for winning the WTA Finals with an undefeated record, even if the world No. 1 says "I never focus on the money."ByTENNIS.comPublished Nov 08, 2025 copy_link

A first WTA Finals trophy isn't the only thing at stake for Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina on Saturday. After both went unbeaten in the round-robin phase of the tournament, the winner of the last match of the season will take home $5.235 million when she takes the title in Riyadh with a combined 5-0 record.It's a hefty sum, the biggest payout in WTA history, in fact—and makes for a cool secondary motivation behind taking home the Billie Jean King Trophy for two players who have already earend some of the game's other big prizes.But the world No. 1, who bagged more than $12 million in year-to-date on-court earnings coming into the year-end championships and figures to improve on her already-lofty place amongst the highest-paid female athetes in the world after her successes this season, says "I never focus on the money."Read more: WTA Finals Final: Sabalenka vs. Rybakina | Where to WatchQ: Aryna, well done.

But one thing Sabalenka is focused on is racking up achievements that will one day add her name to the list of the game's greats. Last year, she became the eighth player to reach the semifinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments and the WTA Finals in the same year, and the other seven are members of the International Tennis Hall of Fame.By doing it again this year, she joined a more exclusive club that consists of Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Justine Henin and Steffi Graf.Read more: Aryna Sabalenka has reached the semifinals at the five biggest tournaments of the year... again"That's crazy to hear my name next to these legends.

I'm trying to make sure that people are coming, people enjoying me, watching kids are getting inspired by me, and then hopefully, by the end of my career, I'll put my name next to these legends, and then I'll be in the in the history of tennis."

By doing it again this year, she joined a more exclusive club that consists of Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Justine Henin and Steffi Graf.Read more: Aryna Sabalenka has reached the semifinals at the five biggest tournaments of the year... again"That's crazy to hear my name next to these legends.

After breaking into the Top 200, the small-town German turns his focus to giving back to the next generation.ByFlorian HeerPublished Nov 08, 2025 copy_link

Germany's Tim Ruehl continued his breakthrough season by capping off another impressive week on the ATP Challenger Tour when he captured the doubles title at the Hamburg Ladies & Gents Cup in late October, partnering Belgium's Michael Geerts. For Ruehl, it marked his second Challenger doubles crown of the season, following their triumph earlier this year at the Dutch Tennis Open in Bunschoten.Reflecting on his latest success at the ATP Challenger 50 hard-court event in Hamburg, Ruehl said: “It was overall a very positive week. We had a tough draw but started strong and handled our matches well. The final was very close again, but in the end, we maybe got one or two more returns in the court, and that made the difference.”Read More: How stepping away from tennis helped George Loffhagen find his game againThe 27-year-old from the small town of Waldshut-Tiengen, nestled in in the southwest of Germany, has enjoyed a steady climb up the doubles rankings this season, currently sitting at a career-high world No. 161. His long-standing partnership with Geerts continues to thrive—both on and off the court.“We've known each other for a long time and played together at Arizona State University,” Ruehl explained. “He's strong from the baseline, and I feel more comfortable at the net, so we complement each other well. We've also spent a lot of time together off the court, which makes it special.”

Before turning professional, Ruehl spent five years in the United States, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Arizona State University and later completed a Master's in Supply Chain Management at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth.“I wasn't a bad junior, but there were definitely better players,” Ruehl admitted. “My coach Peter Pfannkoch advised me to take the college route. At first, I was skeptical, but it turned out to be the right decision. I learned a lot about independence and how to deal with pressure, especially in a team setting.”After returning to Germany, Ruehl based his training back home in Waldshut-Tiengen, near the Swiss border. Without a permanent coach, he works mostly on his own, with support from his father—a former competitive player himself.Off the court, Ruehl is known for his passion for cooking and sports. A certified nutritionist, he enjoys preparing simple, healthy meals. “I have to eat gluten-free, so my go-to dish is a chicken pan with potatoes and vegetables—simple but good,” said the devoted FC Bayern Munich football fan, who also keeps an eye on MSV Duisburg, his father's hometown club.

Looking ahead, Ruehl remains focused on finishing the year strong after achieving one of his main goals for the season—breaking into the Top 200.“At the start of the year, that was the target, and I've managed to achieve it and solidify it with this title. Now Patrick Zahraj and I are heading to the U.S. for three weeks. Let's see what more we can do. Overall, I'm very satisfied and want to end the season on a high note.”Beyond competing, Ruehl is also working on giving back to the sport. Later this year, he and Zahraj will host a new national doubles event in his hometown: The Schlatter Open. Running from December 19–21, it will feature €15,000 (approx. $17,300 USD) in prize money plus hospitality.“We want to create a platform for doubles players, who really deserve more recognition,” Ruehl said. “It's exciting—players like Jakob Schnaitter, Constantin Frantzen, and even 2010 Wimbledon doubles champion Philipp Petzschner will compete. It's going to be a great event.”

Timea Babos reached her fourth WTA Finals title match and Luisa Stefani her first as the duo defeated Hsieh Su-Wei and Jelena Ostapenko in the Riyadh semifinals, coming from a break down to win both sets. Not to be outdone, Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens saved a match point against Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend to reach the final for the first time in three years.

In their debut as a team at the WTA Finals, No. 7 seeds Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani will play for the title after coming from a break down in both sets to defeat No. 6 seeds Hsieh Su-Wei and Jelena Ostapenko 6-4, 7-6(5) in the semifinals.

It's new ground for Babos and Stefani as a team -- Stefani, who is playing the first WTA Finals of her career, becomes the first Brazilian to reach the final of the tournament in its history -- but familiar territory for Babos. The Hungarian is a three-time WTA Finals champion and has now reached her fourth final with a third different partner.

She previously won with Andrea Sestini Hlavackova in 2017, and Kristina Mladenovic in 2018 and 2019 -- memories that helped her as she helped deliver another victory here.

"I never lost in a semifinal of the WTA Finals before, so I'm just keeping that," Babos said in her on-court interview. "I'm very proud of us."

The in-form Babos and Stefani have also advanced to their fifth final of 2025 -- and first above WTA 500 level -- and third in a row following Ningbo (runners-up to Nicole Melichar-Martinez and Liudmila Samsonova) and Tokyo (champions).

In a first-time encounter, Babos and Stefani were the most consistent team throughout. Hsieh and Ostapenko led 3-1 in the first set and 4-2 in the second but were too up-and-down to press home their advantage either time. The Hungarian-Brazilian duo delivered spectacular defense on several key points, holding firm at net to repel both Ostapenko's biggest blows and Hsieh's most creative angles, leaving little space for their opponents to get past.

Hsieh and Ostapenko showed flickers of the magic they can produce -- the Latvian found some accuracy to go with her power to break Stefani for 4-2 in the second set, and Hsieh's touch came to the fore as they saved the first two match points against them trailing 5-4. In the ensuing tiebreak, they were also handed a lifeline from 5-2 down by a pair of nervy volley errors by Babos and Stefani.

But at 5-5, Ostapenko once again was unable to find a way through, netting a forehand for her team's 43rd unforced error of the day, and Babos sealed her third match point with a service winner.

"Really tight in the score, and such a different game style than we've been playing in the past few days," Stefani said afterward. "Two different faces, two different styles. We stayed together -- Timi helped a lot in the first set, I felt I pushed us through the second, and we both helped each other this whole tournament."

Three years ago, Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens defeated Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova in a match tiebreak to capture the Martina Navratilova Trophy in Fort Worth. 

Early Saturday morning, the duo returned to the WTA Finals championship match for the first time since, defeating Siniakova and Taylor Townsend in another match tiebreak, 4-6, 7-6 (6), [10-6] in 1 hour and 52 minutes in Riyadh after saving a match point in the second-set tiebreak.

The match ended just before 1:30 a.m. local time.

"It's pretty late," Mertens said after the match. "Thanks everyone for staying. It really makes a difference. We had to dig really deep against two incredible players. I'm very happy with the super tiebreak that we played. My partner was on fire there. Thanks to our team for cheering."

Kudermetova indeed stepped up on several big points, saving match point with a volley in the second-set tiebreak and sealing the comeback with a smash winner.

Her turnaround followed a rocky start.

"When I started the match, I could not feel the rhythm," she said. "The girls (Siniakova and Townsend) did an amazing job. They tried some things that were not really comfortable for me. But I was fighting a little bit with my husband and then I was angry. And then I woke up and I go, 'OK, we go for it.'"

Siniakova and Townsend broke to open the match and again for a 5-2 lead in the first set. Kudermetova and Mertens broke back when the Australian Open champions served for the set but couldn't complete the rally. The second set opened with another exchange of breaks, as the teams traded service games through the first four games before eventually reaching a tiebreak.

Siniakova and Townsend held match point at 6-5, but Kudermetova's volley kept the title hopes alive. Moments later, a Kudermetova winner clinched the set to force a match tiebreak. From there, Kudermetova and Mertens raced to a 7-3 lead and closed out victory a few points later to advance to the final against Babos and Stefani.

The pairs met once earlier this season, with Kudermetova and Mertens winning in straight sets in Rome en route to the final. 

On the line Saturday is a second WTA Finals crown for Kudermetova and Mertens. Meanwhile, Babos is chasing her fourth, while Stefani, making her debut, seeks her first.

Timea Babos reached her fourth WTA Finals title match and Luisa Stefani her first as the duo defeated Hsieh Su-Wei and Jelena Ostapenko in the Riyadh semifinals, coming from a break down to win both sets.

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Bearman and Ocon meet the fans at Interlagos

Oscar Piastri's championship ambitions were thrown off course in Brazil as he found the barrier during the Sprint.

Oscar Piastri dramatically spun into the barrier during the Sprint in Sao Paulo, putting a dent in his hopes of picking up maximum points in a remarkably tight championship battle.

Conditions around Interlagos were treacherous from the formation lap onwards, with parts of the track appearing damp and slippery, making it tricky to find a racing line that was both dry and effective.

This came to a head on Lap 7, when Piastri drifted onto the kerb at Turn 3. The slick surface sent up a spray of water, forcing him into a spin that ended with his McLaren crashing into the wall and out of the Sprint.

There were eerily similar incidents for Nico Hulkenberg and Franco Colapinto, both of whom dropped a wheel onto the kerb before finding the barrier. The amount of debris resulted in the red flag being waved, temporarily halting the session.

Click go on the video player above to watch the moment that cost Piastri a handful of points.

	The world premiere of Stranger Things‘ fifth and final season Thursday night was a largely joyous affair for everyone involved (save for the time close to 1,000 invited guests had to spend cooped up in the Chinese Theatre with their phones locked as the screening started an hour late.)


	The cast and creators smiled and posed for photos on the red carpet as they appeared to be enjoying each other's company. That included stars Millie Bobby Brown and David Harbour who hugged and shared a laugh in front of photographers.


	The two were closely watched at the premiere, their every movement and word scrutinized, as their reunion came days after a Nov. 1 Daily Mail report that claimed that the British actress, who plays girl with supernatural abilities Eleven on the show, had filed a harassment and bullying complaint against Harbour, who portrays her adoptive father Jim. 

	











	The controversy, fueled by the silence from all parties involved and Harbour's ex-wife Lily Allen's recently released “revenge album,” threatened to overshadow the premiere. It didn't happen, with the cast and creators presenting united front, Brown and Harbour arriving together, Netflix releasing video of them and Brown posting a joint photo on social.

	Nobody addressed the accusations directly, with Brown and Harbour praising each other in separate interviews and co-creator Ross Duffer telling THR that “nothing matters more than just having a set where everyone feels safe and happy.”

	











	According to sources, there was a tiff between Brown and Harbour, and she did complain about his behavior, however it may not have been as recent as the report suggested, but earlier in the series' run. It was dealt with, and there hadn't been issues since, sources said.


	After posing on the red carpet, Brown, Harbour and the rest of the cast took the stage inside the Chinese Theatre, where they were introduced by the series' creators, Matt and Ross Duffer.


	The Duffer brothers, the series director/executive producer Shawn Levy and Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos and Chief Creative Officer Bela Bajaria spoke before the screening of the Season 5 premiere episode, all becoming emotional as they did. 

Shawn Levy teases how emotional he was watching the final episode (Episode 8) of #StrangerThings Season 5 – which will have a theatrical release on December 31 pic.twitter.com/9qI4ODq8h8


	“I was in a magical place 10 years ago when Stranger Things was pitched to Netflix,” Sarandos said, noting that while House of Cards put the streamer on the original series map, “our real moment was when we put on Stranger Things,” a show that “moved the culture.” 


Stranger Things was the first hit produced and fully owned by Netflix (earlier standouts like House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black came from outside studios), and its massive popularity turned it into a lucrative brand and merchandising bonanza for the tech company.


	The Duffer brothers thanked the people they considered to have played a crucial role in Stranger Things‘ success, including Dan Cohen, the former executive at Shawn Levy's company who was the first to champion their script after many rejections, Levy who embraced it, Sarandos, who got it on the platform, and the fans who helped to make it into a world phenomenon. They also acknowledged Bajaria for her support of the show over its last two seasons.


	The speeches made it seem like Sarandos was the one who took the Stranger Things pitch and greenlighted the series. As Chief Creative Officer at the time, Sarandos did have ultimate greenlight authority, and his role in Stranger Things‘ success is undeniable. There were others, too.


	Several years ago, the Duffers presented a different version in an essay for Time magazine about Cindy Holland, Netflix's former head of English-language scripted originals under Sarandos.


	“When we pitched Stranger Things to Netflix, we were told Cindy Holland was the key,” they wrote in 2018. “As it turns out, she's also extremely difficult to read in a room. We left the pitch certain of only one thing: Cindy hated it. One day later, she greenlighted our show, and our lives changed.”


	There was no mention of Holland in any of the on-stage remarks at the premiere. That is not unusual — it is standard Hollywood practice for executives to be erased once replaced. Still, an occasion such as the end of an extraordinary successful show could call for an exception.


	Another detail from the on-stage remarks was not lost on the attendees. The Netflix executives made a point to introduce the Duffer brothers — who are set to leave the streamer in April for a film and TV deal at Paramount that will allow them to make theatrical features and reunite with Holland and another former Netflix exec involved in Stranger Things‘ ascend, Matt Thunell — as being “a big part of the Netflix family.”


	Season 5 of Stranger Things premieres Nov. 26 with Part 1, followed by Part 2 on Dec. 25 and the finale on Dec. 31.

	A lawyer for Jeremy Renner denied the accusations against the actor brought forth by filmmaker Yi Zhou, who Renner allegedly had a “brief consensual encounter” with. Both Renner and Zhou also revealed Saturday that they have sent each other cease-and-desist letters over the ordeal. 


	Over the last week, in a series of Instagram posts and a Daily Mail interview, Zhou accused the Hawkeye star of sending her unsolicited “intimate” photos and video and then threatening to “call ICE” on her after she “called him out privately” on alleged misconduct.


	Zhou, director of the documentary Chronicles of Disney featuring Renner, claimed that she had a personal and professional relationship with Renner that left her fearing for her safety.


	“Mr. Renner first contacted me directly in June, sending personal and intimate photographs of himself, behavior that, according to public reports, he has exhibited before,” Zhou wrote on Instagram. She claims Renner wooed her over calls and text discussions, saying he wanted a relationship. Zhou alleges they started dating and working together on two projects, including Chronicles of Disney, and that Renner “appears in 80% of the film.”

	However, when the documentary was released last month, Renner “refused to make any public promotion,” despite allegedly having entered into written agreements with her production company. Zhou says she appealed to Renner to help her combat fan accounts falsely claiming the documentary was generated by AI without his consent, but he refused.

	











	“When I called him out privately about his past misconduct and asked him to behave properly, to respect me as a woman and as a filmmaker, he threatened to call immigration/ICE on me, an act that deeply shocked and frightened me,” she wrote. “Such behavior is unacceptable and emblematic of the imbalance of power that continues to harm women in our industry.” A rep for the actor previously told Rolling Stone that the allegations were “totally inaccurate and untrue.”

	In a statement to People on Saturday, Renner's lawyer Marty Singer said Zhou's claims were “false, outrageous and highly defamatory,” adding that Zhou was retaliating against Renner after he “rejected her romantic advances” and did not promote their shared projects on social media.


	Singer admitted that Renner and Zhou had a “brief consensual encounter” that occurred in July 2025. However, Singer claims Renner cut off communication with Zhou after she continually sent him “sexually explicit messages expressing her love,” with the most recent one she allegedly sent on Oct. 24.


	As for Zhou's claim that Renner threatened to call ICE, Singer said the filmmaker “had been relentlessly harassing and threatening my client with hundreds of unsolicited and unwanted messages.” 


	“The true facts are that Ms. Zhou has relentlessly and aggressively harassed and pursued my client for months with no reciprocation on my client's part, other than a single brief encounter on July 12, 2025,” Singer told People. (Zhou did not immediately return Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.)

	TMZ reported Saturday that Renner had sent a cease-and-desist letter to Zhou over the situation; hours later, Zhou responded on social media revealing that she sent Renner a cease-and-desist letter of her own on November 5.


	“I am sharing my official cease and desist letters sent to Jeremy Renner and his representatives,” Zhou wrote Saturday. “These letters were sent after I received unsolicited sexual content in the beginning and throughout the months, misinformation about my professional work, and threats involving ICE. These letters show the struggle are about continued sexual images, fans smear campaign and threats involving ICE, they are not because he did not reciprocate in a [relationship] we have been since June.”

When the 13th season of Hallmark Channel's hit series “When Calls The Heart”  premieres in 2026, at least two past guest stars will return to Hope Valley — Melissa Gilbert, who first joined the cast in 2024, and Brooke Shields, whose character hasn't appeared in a decade. 

That begs the question: could Lori Loughlin be close behind? On November 7, 2025, series lead Erin Krakow gave Us Weekly an intriguing four-word answer: “I sure hope so.” 

Loughlin, who first rose to fame as Aunt Becky on “Full House,” played beloved “When Calls The Heart” character Abigail Stanton from 2013 to 2019. Hallmark cut ties with her during season six and removed her from the cast following her arrest and eventual jail sentence for her involvement in the largest college admissions scandal in U.S. history. 

But in recent years, many fans and former castmates have expressed hope, like Krakow, that Loughlin will be forgiven and allowed to return to Hope Valley. 

Krakow, whose new movie “Christmas Above the Clouds” premieres on November 8, told Us Weekly, “I love Lori Loughlin, and I love the character she created, Abigail Stanton.” 

Noting that Loughlin's return is “something I've been hoping for for years and years,” Krakow told the outlet, “I'm very much a fan of hers and a friend of hers, so I really hope that it's happening.” 

This is not the first time Krakow has publicly advocated for Loughlin's return. In 2024, she and her “When Calls The Heart” co-star Kevin McGarry both said they'd welcome her back with open arms.

“She's an incredible person, a very dear friend,” Krakow said at the time. “She's got a real good heart. People don't even know how special a person she is, and it would be wonderful to have her back in Hope Valley.” 

McGarry weighed in, “I think there's been lots of people that (have) said we'd love to have her back. It's not our decision of course.” 

Even show co-creator Brian Bird said in 2023 that he was open to bringing Loughlin back on the series, stating on the “When Calls The Heart Aftershow” podcast that there had been “good conversations” about her potential return. 

He said in that interview, “Our attitude always has been, you know as the producing team and the writing team around ‘When Calls the Heart,' that what better place for second chances than Hope Valley. And so in theory, it should work, right? But again, can't fully promise it but we're working on it.”

Following their 2019 arrests, Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, pleaded guilty in 2020 to charges of mail and wire fraud, per Us Weekly, after they and dozens of other parents were charged with paying to help ensure their teenage children were admitted to the colleges they wanted to attend. Loughlin and Giannulli's daughters — Bella and Olivia Jade — were accepted by the University of Southern California.

In 2020, Loughlin served two months and Giannuli served five months in jail, per Us Weekly, and tried to move past the scandal together, with Loughlin slowly returning to acting, including two movies on Great American Family. 

But in early October, after nearly three decades of marriage, TMZ reported that Loughlin and Giannuli had separated and were no longer living together.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SATURDAY AM: 20th Century Studios' Predator Badlands is looking good, knock on wood, coursing to a very near record opening for the franchise, around $37M, after a $15.6M Friday/previews and the best CinemaScore a Predator movie has ever seen of A-. As we told you, the previous highs for a Predator movie were the original 1987 installment and 1990 sequel which earned B+s. That audience score is further boosted by the Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak definite recommend of 78% and five stars — which is platinum for any movie. 


	It's clear audiences are enjoying this version of Predator from director/producer/writer Dan Trachtenberg and producers Ben Rosenblatt and John Davis, hence the higher-than-expected ticket sales which were expected to be around the $25M range. The movie's momentum is in a better position than Disney's early October attempted tentpole, Tron: Ares thanks to word of mouth. At the end of the day, no matter how much stunting a studio does in a highly competitive social media-streaming landscape, the movie ultimately sells itself; meaning audiences discover it upon viewing and spread the gospel from there. Both Tron: Ares and Predator: Badlands dazzled Hall H at San Diego Comic-Con with equally memorable stunts; the lead character of the latter, Dek, stepping on stage to scan the audience with his eye vision. 

	











	Switching ratings, i.e. from R to PG-13, hasn't dented the appeal for the alien killer movie, this particular installment casting the series villain as the protag. That's the hook as far as distinguishing itself from previous Predator movies. Rather than just one sheet the fleshy toothy faced guy in a profile shot, Badlands one-sheets really went hardcore sci-fi with epic shots of him battling creatures, etc. The problem with the static opening between 2018's The Predator and 2010's Predators opening to around the same number of $25M, stemmed from the campaigns being quite similar and not selling anything fresh. There was no one-up. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	What's interesting though is that by going to PG-13, that may not have necessarily brought in a younger audience: Badlands only pulled in 5% for the 13-17 demo. Badlands compared to 2018's The Predator shows that older males still come out for the IP (57% to 45%), as well as older females (about the same between both installments at 22%). However, men under 25 shrunk between The Predator and Badlands (went from 21% to 16% share) in addition to women under 25 (11% to 5%). Diversity demos are 44% Caucasian, 26% Latino and Hispanic (bigger than The Predator‘s 23%), 15% Black and 8% Asian American. 


Predator: Badlands has nearly all the Imax and premium large format screens which are driving 53% of the weekend. Pic is playing best in the South Central and West with the latter seeing 43% of the gross coming from there vs a norm of 38% for all other titles in the marketplace. The AMC Burbank is Badlands' best theater in the country with over $59K to date. 


	With a social media universe of 244M across TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and X, Badlands reach is very similar to the reach of Alien: Romulus before opening, that being 246M. Elle Fanning is promoting to her 6.7M fans. Social media data corp RelishMix remarks, “Convo runs positive for Predator: Badlands as fans are lit up at the idea of expanding the Yautja universe beyond Earth, praising its young-blood narrative and connections to Prey and Predators (2010). Enthusiasts loved the lore depth and ‘proving hunt' concept, calling it ‘refreshing' and ‘bad ass.' Comments like ‘Looks fantastic — reminds me when people clowned on Prey and it was awesome,' and ‘Teenage Yautja with something to prove? Sign me up,' highlight genuine anticipation. Others noted the Monsterverse-style shift toward creature-led storytelling, celebrating it as ‘finally giving us the Predator story we've been waiting for.'


	As far as the new upscale adult films, oy, nothing is mind-blowing gross wise. See below. 


	2. Regretting You (Par) 3,196 (-229) theaters, Fri $2.2M (+80%), 3-day $7.3M (-7%), Total $38.7M/Wk 3The Constantin $30M production brought into Paramount by former Global Marketing and Distribution Boss Marc Weinstock is bound for $100M worldwide. Phenomenal hold here. 


	3. Black Phone 2 (Uni) 2,943 (-362) theaters, Fri $1.5M (-38%), 3-day $5.2M (-38%), Total $70M/Wk 4


	4. Sarah's Oil (AMZ) 2,410, Fri $1.7M 3-day $4.4M/Wk 1The best of the adult bunch. Who knew? No surprise when you realize that it's a Kingdom Story production (their fanbase knows about these faith-based films). A+ CinemaScore which is where faith-based audience scores live. Nothing shocking here: over 55 is 48% of the audience, 66% women. The Zachary Levi movie is playing where these pics play best in the South, South Central and Midwest with 63% of the gross coming from there compared to a norm of 44% for all other titles in the marketplace. The Southlake Pavilion in Atlanta is the movie's top grossing location with just over $5K. 


	5. Nuremberg (SPC) 1,802 theaters, Fri $1.4M 3 day $3.8M/Wk 1No CinemaScore, but great PostTrak exits of 5 stars, 76% definite recommend, and 93% positive to overshadow those middling reviews of 69% fresh. The over 55 crowd was prominent at 51% (they gave it an amazing 88% definite recommend), over 45 at 67%, and male leaning at 57% for the WWII drama. Pic is playing on the coasts with 48% of the gross coming from there versus 43% of all films in the marketplace. AMC Grove in LA is the top grossing multiplex with just over $13K. Caucasian 75%, Latino and Hispanic at 10%, 6% Black and 5% Asian American. 


	6. Bugonia (Foc) 2,043 theaters, Fri $1M (-43%), 3-day $3.7M (-26%), Total $12.5M/Wk 3


	7. Chainsaw Man (Sony) 2,285 (-718) theaters, Fri $900K (-31%), 3-day $3.6M (-42%), total $38M/Wk 3

	











	8. Die My Love (Mubi) 1,983 theaters, Fri $1M, 3-day $2.7M/Wk 1A huge chasm between critics at 78% on Rotten Tomatoes and audiences who dismissed this Jennifer Lawrence-Robert Pattinson melodrama about a woman's depression from Lynne Ramsay with a D+. Remember Lawrence's other big swing from Darren Aronofsky, Mother! got an F back in 2017. Despite the great acting in Die My Love, this is a tough movie about a very sad situation; that's hard if you want to lasso people off their couches.  Can't write this enough: Mubi paid $24M for domestic and multiple foreign rights on the movie (versus $12.5M they shelled out for The Substance; that hipster horror pic opened to $3.2M and did a 5.5x multiple with a final domestic of $17.5M).  A 29% definite recommend on PostTrak is the kiss of death. Male leaning at 51%., 25-34 being the biggest show at 44% with 18-34 at 78%. Diversity demos are 60% Caucasian, 22% Latino and Hispanic, 9% Black, and 6% Asian American. Coastal play, which is what these upscale adult movies do, with 50% coming from the East and West. AMC Lincoln Square in NYC is the top grossing location with $12k.

	11. Christy (Black) 2,184 theaters, Fri $600K, 3-day $1.25M/Wk 1The biopic about female boxer Christy Martin, Black Bear finance's foray into domestic theatrical distribution, gets a B+ CinemaScore better than A24's MMA movie Smashing Machine which landed an B-. PostTraks are better with a solid 84% positive and a 59% definite recommend. Maybe this builds more momentum today off that and breaks into the top 10. Sydney Sweeney championed the movie all the way through including appearances last night at the AMC Century City with director David Michod. Black Bear put this theatrical release together quite quickly, taking their own movie off the table from domestic buyers and positioning it for an asap theatrical release post its TIFF world premiere. The town says we need more theatrical distributors in an environment where major studios like Paramount and Warner Bros could potentially collapse into each other. Let's see where Black Bear winds up in the long run. It took a while for A24 to build-up its brand; Bling Ring with Emma Watson was one of its early releases and only grossed $5.8M before we got to the Hereditary, Uncut Gems, Everything Everywhere All at Once, etc. 


FRIDAY AFTERNOON UPDATE: 20th Century Studios' Predator: Badlands is creeping toward the second-best Friday start ever for the franchise at $14M, which would get the Dan Trachtenberg-directed movie to the second-best opening ever for a Predator movie at $33M. The John Davis-produced feature is booked at 3,725 theaters.


	The best Friday and opening for a Predator movie belongs to 2004's Alien v. Predator with $16.4M and $38.2M, respectively. Friday ticket sales of $14M includes the combined previews from Wednesday and Thursday of $4.8M.


	Some might say, “Oh, well, this looks like Tron: Ares,” given how that movie a month ago posted a $14.4M Friday and a $33.2M start. But Predator: Badlands has some of the best reviews and audience scores for its franchise, plus it cost 52% less than the $220M pricetag of the Jared Leto movie.


RELATED: ‘Regretting You' Review: True Love Inevitably Prevails In A Ridiculous Romantic Drama


	Second place goes to Paramount's Colleen Hoover adaptation Regretting You with a third Friday of $1.9M and third weekend of $6.5M, -17%, at 3,196 theaters for a running total by Sunday of $37.9M.

	











	At 2,943 theaters, it's the fourth frame of Universal/Blumhouse's The Black Phone 2 with $4.2M, -50%, after a $1.2M Friday and running cume through Sunday of $69M.


	Fourth is Amazon MGM Studios/Kingdom Story/Wonder Project's Sarah's Oil is the best of the original adult bunch with $1.6M today, and $4.1M for the weekend at 2,410 theaters. 


	Focus Features' third weekend (second wide) of Yorgos Lanthimos' Bugonia is looking at $1.1M today at 2,043 theaters, $3.7M for the frame, -26%, for a total by EOD Sunday of $12.5M.

	Sony Pictures Classics' Nuremberg starring Russell Crowe, Rami Malek, Michael Shannon, John Slattery and more is seeing $1.4M today for a $3.5M opening at 1,802 theaters. 


FRIDAY AM: The Dan Trachtenberg-directed Predator: Badlands speared $4.8 million in previews, which includes both Wednesday fan and Thursday night shows.


	The preview number is less than that of another sci-fi genre title, Alien: Romulus‘ $6.5M, which also was a franchise reboot for the revived 20th Century Studios under new owner Disney. That Fede Alvarez-directed revival went on to open to $42M stateside. But keep in mind that movie was R-rated and had a mid-August release in 2024. Also, Predator: Badlands, with its female action hero sensibility, also is getting comperd by Disney sources to Ballerina, which did $3.8M in previews before a $24.5M opening in June. Badlands previews are also ahead of 2017's Blade Runner 2049 which did $3.5M before a $12.5M Friday, and 3-day of $32.7M.


	Also good news for Badlands at this point in time: Total previews here are ahead of The Predator, which did $2.5M in Thursday previews back in September 2018. That pic posted a $10.3M Friday on its way to a $24.6M start.


	2004 crossover title Alien vs. Predator owns the franchise opening record at the domestic B.O. with $38.2M. 2010's Predators from director Nimród Antal and produced by Robert Rodriguez follows as the second-best U.S./Canada opening for the series at $24.7M. The forecast going into the weekend for Badlands was $25M+, hopefully the second-best start in the Predator franchise.


	1987's Predator and 1990's Predator 2 own the best CinemaScores for the series conceived by Jim and John Thomas with a B+.


Predator: Badlands cost $105M net before marketing, shot in New Zealand with tax credits. Trachtenberg breathed new life into the Predator movies in August 2022 with the direct-to-Hulu Prey, which was the streamer's most-watched premiere ever at the time. Critics believed the movie should have been booked in theaters, hence, here we are with Badlands. 


	On the Rotten Tomatoes audience scale, Badlands is the fan favorite of the franchise with 96%, ahead of the original 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger movie at 87%. Prey remains the most critically acclaimed in the alien series at 94%.


	Amazon MGM Studios release of Kingdom Story's Sarah's Oil posted $460K in previews. The Cyrus Nowrasteh-directed faith-based movie starring Zachary Levi, Sonequa Martin-Green and Garrett Dillahunt follows the true story of 11-year old Sarah Rector, an African American girl born in Oklahoma Indian Territory in the early 1900s who believes there is oil beneath the barren land she's allotted and whose faith is proven right.

Predator only has ONE bad movie in seven movies: The Predator from 2018. Badlands is a middle of the pack movie but damn, I had fun seeing this in a laser projection theater. If you're a fan of Predator, see this movie and don't let the PG13 rating deter you. It's mainly because of a loophole in the violence area and limited profanity. Oh and for those trying to say this is a woke movie but haven't seen it, you couldn't be further wrong, it's NOT a woke movie so please, stop it already.

Reviews are irrelevant.

It's odd how a lot of the coverage of the potential hits of this month is leaving out THE RUNNING MAN. PREDATOR: BADLANDS is great, but I feel like RUNNING MAN will steal quite a bit of its business in its second weekend.

Who asked for this movie? I hope they didn't spend more than 50 mil.

Since you inquired, I specifically asked for it.

I asked for an excellent pizza

thank you.

lol

Fan of the series, but not all movies have been worth seeing to be honest. This one definitely IS! By the same guy who did PREY and KILLER OF KILLERS. Very smart move to not have any red blood but the same amount of action. Gets more people in the theaters, and more money. Anyone not seeing because it is PG13 will see it anyway once they hear how good it is. IF they don't, that's their loss. Can't make everyone happy. BUT, definitely Happy I Saw It!

	After making its debut to the world, the teaser trailer for Michael, soared to 116.2 million views worldwide in its first 24 hours. That's the largest 24-hour trailer launch ever in Lionsgate‘s history and the most viewed trailer for any music biopic or concert movie in motion picture history. 


	The data comes this AM from WaveMetrix. 


	The highly anticipated biopic of the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, outstripped the first 24 hour global trailer traffic of Taylor Swift: Eras Tour, which counted 96.1 million views after an Aug. 31, 2023 drop, as well as Bob Marley: One Love (60.1M views with a trailer debut of July 6, 2023), Bohemain Rhapsody (57.6M, May 15, 2018) and Searchlight's Bob Dylan movie A Complete Unknown (47.2M, July 24, 2024).

	How best to explain Patriot? The cult-favorite spy series, which premiered 10 years ago this week on Amazon and ran for two seasons, follows CIA operative John Tavner (Michael Dorman, years before his turn as a lovelorn astronaut on For All Mankind) as he goes undercover at a mundane piping manufacturer in Milwaukee. As the pilot lays out, his mission is, in theory, simple: Get hired at the piping company, join the team on a regularly scheduled work trip to Luxembourg, and make a covert cash handoff there with an Iranian agent who will help secure a more U.S.-friendly regime.


	Tonally, though, beneath the coat of tradecraft and international intrigue, the show is about as far from The Americans as you can get. John's mission goes rapidly awry with a veritable Rube Goldberg machine of oft-absurd speed bumps, including a CIA goof that gives his false Wisconsin identity one too many Social Security Number digits; John's PTSD dating from a previous job gone bad (and the marijuana dependency he developed while recuperating); and a no-nonsense taskmaster boss (played with malicious aplomb by Kurtwood Smith). Patriot is less interested in dead drops than it is in charting John's plodding march into morally gray situations and mounting depression. It's also very, very funny: One way that John copes is by turning up at open mic nights to perform gloomy folk songs with little concern for OPSEC. In what is likely the former Iranian president's only appearance in a singer-songwriter ballad, one lyric has John crooning about the day the United States learned that “Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was fucking around with new centrifuges.” Later in the song, he sings, “I'm showing several signs of increasing mental instability.”

	











	Created by Steven Conrad, best known for writing dreary yet whimsical films like The Pursuit of Happyness and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Patriot never managed to capture an audience during its all-too-short run. But through the power of rewatches it has won a passionate fandom in the years since. Hilarious, bleak, and bizarre, it represents the spirit of Peak TV: the distillation of an auteur's singular vision in a brief moment of if-you-build-it-they-will-come studio optimism.

	“I pitched it to Amazon, and at the time they had an appetite for a show like that,” says Conrad, who admits the concept was a bit of a bait-and-switch from the start. “I think they were banking that the spy genre was going to do a little more legwork than the show that we all privately had in mind.”


	In the decade since its debut, that sneakily idiosyncratic show with oddball plots and winning performances by beloved characters has slowly but surely made its mark. It sports a bustling subreddit and ongoing word-of-mouth recruits to the fandom. And lately, Prime's recommendations algorithm seems to have taken a shine to it — perhaps mistaking it for a sharp spy game as its human predecessors did, or perhaps not. (Prime declined to comment.) For viewers and those who had a hand in making the show, the only regret is that there isn't more Patriot to devour.


	“It was all just a real delight,” says Smith, whose cantankerous piping executive had, what else, a dark past. Of Patriot's 2019 cancellation, he says, “I have not forgiven Amazon for this.”


PATRIOT ARRIVED COURTESY of Prime's short-lived Pilot Season program, then the cornerstone of the streamer's eager investment in original programming. Pilot Season, which launched in 2013, was an attempt to add a viewer-forward sheen to Hollywood's traditional buffet of inaugural episodes. Instead of studio execs making the call on whether to send a given program to series, it was up to viewers, who were offered a full slate of freshman episodes from new shows and asked to share their feedback on what they hoped to see more of. Though the program launched some notable hits — among them The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Transparent, and The Man in the High Castle — it would last just five years.

	But in the lead-up to 2015, the studio was still taking big swings. “Ten years ago, the nature of this business was a little different,” Conrad says. “You could feel that the feature [film] landscape had changed and become primarily IP and superhero movies. TV had a depth then, and an ambition, on the heels of very successful long-term shows like Sopranos and Mad Men. You could just feel that becoming kind of a new art form.”Espionage thrillers were good business, then and now, but some of Patriot's layered complexity is a reflection of the TV of the time. When I asked Terry O'Quinn, who played Tom Tavner — John's father and the senior CIA officer who keeps sending his increasingly battered son into the field — about its initial billing as a spy drama, he told me he'd never thought of the show that way. “It's kind of a family drama,” he says. Indeed, both Tom and John's brother (Michael Chernus) are called in to assist with problems ranging from the meddling of an overqualified Luxembourgish detective to an ill-timed run-in with a puppeteer.


Patriot resists easy characterization chiefly because of Conrad's writing, which gives his characters strange rhythms and, sometimes, even stranger verbiage. (Conrad, who regularly performs in a band around the L.A. area, also wrote the show's soundtrack, including John's brooding folk songs.) “Every week or week and a half when we would get a new script, it was like Christmastime,” Smith says. He remembers getting the script for one early episode from Conrad, who cautioned that Smith's character, Leslie Claret, would be delivering a speech that Conrad wanted to film as a “oner” — a single, long shot, with his character on camera nearly the entire time. No problem, thought Smith. Then he read the script.

	











	As part of a pep talk ahead of an important pitch in Luxembourg, Leslie — who in the Patriot universe wrote a seminal piping textbook called The Integral Principles of the Structural Dynamics of Flow — gathers his team around him. “Keep it simple,” he starts, before diving into a monologue that includes the promise that “using a field of half-seized sprats and brass-fitted nickel slits, our bracketed caps and splay-flexed brace columns vent dampers to dampening hatch depths of one-half meter from the damper crown to the spurv plinth.”


	“I said, ‘Steve, does this mean anything? Where did you get all this?'” Smith says. “And he said, ‘No, it doesn't mean anything. They're all words and expressions that I found in various places having to do with piping. But no, put together it means nothing.'”


	To memorize it, Smith invented meanings for all those nickel slits and spurv plinths to give the speech at least some false cohesion. He then spent a month devoting an hour or two every morning to rehearsing it, with another session later in the day with an assistant. In the end, the scene was filmed in just two attempts — with the second necessary only because of a camera error. When the episode premiered at the Berlin Film Festival, the speech got a standing ovation.


	Still, the overall response to the show was muted. Despite getting picked up for a full season after a favorable response during Pilot Season, reviews were scarce and middling. “Amazon's Patriot is a good example of how ‘peak TV' inspires over-confidence in old ideas,” The Verge declared, before lamenting that “prestige television has gotten sort of out of control.” Comparisons to the work of the Coen brothers were rampant and not always positive.


	The show chugged along nonetheless, gradually attracting fans who adored its stark cinematography and weirdo colloquialisms. (If you watch it, you are unlikely ever to think about the word “cool” the same way again.) “I've had people come up [to me] and they seem to either really love it or they didn't know anything at all about it,” says O'Quinn. The actor is most often recognized for his role as John Locke on Lost, but the fans who know him as Tom Tavner are especially fervent. “The people who were turned on to it seemed to be crazy about it.”

	











PATRIOT WAS RENEWED for a second season, which debuted in 2018. Filming took the cast and crew to Paris for a whopping five months. One day of shooting left Smith and O'Quinn, who had become fast friends, riding the Metro for hours on end. O'Quinn remembers confiding to Smith that if it were up to him, he'd just keep on doing Patriot and then retire. “We're both of a certain age,” O'Quinn recalls saying at the time. “If I could just do this for five or six more years and call it a day, I'd be pretty happy.”


	But Patriot was not to have a long life. Conrad says that he knew the show's days were numbered midway through the Paris shoot, and that John's story should be wrapped up as cleanly as possible: “I could read the writing on the wall. I had every sense that we weren't going to have a Season Three.”


	By the time the show was officially canceled in 2019, Peak TV was already contracting and Prime in particular was going through a period of executive tumult. “There were three different presidents of the studio while we were making that show,” Conrad says. “Even in this business, that's a lot of turnover.” (O'Quinn likens the rotating executives and resulting fallout to “a pride of lions — when a new lion comes in, they kill all the babies.”)


	The changes at Prime meant that Patriot had no champion at the studio level; it got to feeling, Conrad says, like “the show doesn't belong to anybody.” But he believes that the series benefitted from that dynamic in some ways, too, skating through production receiving fewer studio notes than you might expect for a show that often pairs wanton violence with deadpan slapstick. “It was a little more ‘ours' than is ordinary because of all that,” he says.


	Though it hasn't been so long since its cancellation, it's hard to imagine a show with such an eccentric approach getting the green light today, never mind that kind of creative freedom in production. “When we first started, it was, ‘This is the way television should be,'” says Smith. “We're not worrying about ratings and this and that. We're doing something that's good, and hoping that, eventually, people will watch a lot of it. But the idea creatively is to build a good product. And then that changed, just in the time that we were doing this show.”


	“That's the sad commentary on American television, or maybe television in general, because it has to hit the middle of the target,” O'Quinn says. “It can't be on the perimeter. And Steven writes — he lives on the perimeter.”The Patriot creative trust, for its part, is still going strong. Conrad has penned a real-life version of the Structural Dynamics of Flow and written episodes of a surreal podcast voiced by Smith's character, which Smith says he recorded in a closet at home filled with hats for sound dampening. Conrad is a creator who tends to draw from a recurring stable of actors in all his works, and many Patriot cast members have popped up in his more recent projects, like 2019's spiritually similar thriller series Perpetual Grace, LTD and 2021's stop-motion animated series Ultra City Smiths. The upcoming HBO limited series, DTF St. Louis, which Conrad created and directed, will feature his brother, Chris, a memorable piping colleague from Patriot.

	











	I spoke with Conrad, O'Quinn, and Smith at a difficult time for the Patriot team: Last month, Chicago artist Tony Fitzpatrick, who played a delightfully dreadful security guard named Jack Birdbath in Patriot, died. As the news broke, Patriot alumni found themselves calling and texting one another from around the world, sharing memories of Fitzpatrick and their time working with him. “We lost Jack,” Conrad says. “But somehow, knowing that 10 years later, everybody still cares about each other that way, enough so that we all stopped what we were doing and we all found each other — we're all going to find each other again someday on something else.”

	On his birthday last year, Smith sat back and wondered what he should do to celebrate. Then he landed on an idea: He would rewatch Patriot with his wife. He'd seen it before, of course, back when it was newly out, but that was different. “You know exactly what's coming, and you're hoping that this scene works, or that works,” he says. “You've got all those things going on in your head, and you're not just sitting there watching.”


	This time, though? He laughed and laughed. “We watched several episodes, and I was so knocked out by the way things were put together,” he says. “I just thought it was great.”

“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” was unexpectedly pulled from its Thursday lineup as Jimmy Kimmel tended to a “personal matter,” sparking concern among fans. 

Ticket holders for the Thursday, November 6, show were reportedly informed that their taping had been abruptly canceled, according to New York Post.

“Tonight's episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live has been postponed. Apologies for any inconvenience. We will contact you to reschedule for a future taping,” one fan shared via Reddit in an apparent screenshot of an email received from the ticket company. ”

Madison Beer — who was scheduled to be the musical guest on the November 6 show — took to social media to address the change. 

“Due to unforeseen circumstances, @jimmykimmellive needed to reschedule my performance that was originally scheduled to air tonight to a later date,” Beer wrote in a post shared via her Instagram Story. “I'll share more details on timing when I can. I can't wait for you all to see it.”

Actor David Duchovny and “Stranger Things” star Joe Keery were both set to sit down with Jimmy Kimmel. 

ABC ultimately aired a rerun of the October 28 episode, which LateNighter explained was due to a “personal matter” for Kimmel. 

“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” is scheduled to return with new episodes on Monday, November 10, the outlet revealed.

While no further details were shared regarding the postponement, late-night fans showed their support for the host via social media.

“I hope it's not due to a family emergency and everything is okay,” one fan wrote via Reddit. 

“Given what just happened in Sept. any missed tapings makes me anxious. I am hoping it's nothing bad,” another wrote. 

Kimmel's absence raises concern as just two months prior ABC briefly suspended the hit show after receiving pressure from the FCC and station owners. 

The network ultimately reinstated “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” just one week after announcing the suspension.

“Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” ABC said in a statement on September 22. “It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.”

Kimmel, 57, later admitted he believed his late-night career was over throughout his suspension. 

“‘Well, that's it,'” Kimmel said on Bloomberg Screentime on October 8. “Because there seemed to be a list of demands presented to me, and I was not going to go along with any of them. So it's was like, ‘Well, I guess we're done.' I said to my wife, ‘That's it. It's over.'”

Neither Kimmel nor ABC has publicly addressed the postponement.

			By Jake Kanter, Max Goldbart 


	Uncertainty over ITV‘s future has been one of the dominant themes of 2025. Famed for launching Downton Abbey, the network has been courting sale interest for well over a year, but for all the industry chatter and press speculation, ITV's silence has been stony. That all changed on Friday, when the UK broadcaster dropped a bombshell worthy of Love Island: a buyer has entered the villa.


	In a 70-word statement, ITV told shareholders that Comcast-owned Sky has made a £1.6B ($2.1B) bid for its media and entertainment division, which houses its TV networks and streaming service. If a deal is completed — and it remains an if — then ITV will be split in two, with shareholders retaining control of ITV Studios, the production and distribution unit behind shows including Fool Me Once and The Voice.

					ITV Confirms Talks With Sky Owner Comcast Over $2.1B Sale Of Networks Arm		
			








	Deadline hears that Sky has been laying the groundwork for this moment for some time. Sky, which is very much leading on the deal with its parent Comcast in the background, has been quietly talking to ITV leaders about the shape of the takeover and why it makes sense for both parties. Work has also been undertaken to examine whether regulatory hurdles can be cleared. A formal deal remains weeks, if not months away, but a source familiar with the talks said there is “goodwill and momentum.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	ITV's much-discussed and notoriously sticky share price (chair Andrew Coslett was heckled over it at ITV's latest AGM) jumped more than 10% after the bid was announced, but Sky's move has left some in the industry scratching their heads. 


	The pay-TV operator is one of the British media's great success stories, forged when Rupert Murdoch was at his swashbuckling best. But in recent years, the company has been managing decline and has at times felt like an unloved child in the Comcast empire. On a recent earnings call, Comcast chiefs, including Brian L. Roberts, did not mention Sky once — usually because it raises awkward questions about the hefty $39B Comcast paid for Sky in 2018. On the Sky side, there is a view among some at its West London HQ that Comcast has mismanaged its asset. Sky, which has made mass layoffs over the past year but did return to profit, has had its value written down by £1.2B, (nearly a quarter) since it was acquired.

	











	So why is Comcast backing Sky's pursuit of another contracting business? Or, as one observer dryly put it: “Why would you want to take the bad part of ITV away from the really good part?”


A Scale Play


	Those close to the deal will tell you that Sky sees ITV as complementary, bringing together the UK's biggest free-to-air commercial broadcaster with the top pay-TV platform. There is a belief that this will present a compelling offer for advertisers and help unlock new subscribers for Sky. For both parties, bigger is seen as better in a world in which they are competing for viewers, and therefore revenue, with global giants like YouTube and TikTok. This, of course, mirrors what is happening in the U.S., with buyers circling Warner Bros. Discovery as the ink dries on the Paramount-Skydance merger. “The way the market is looking, a deal like this does make sense,” said a Sky insider.


	Industry execs noted that Sky has been mulling a free-to-air acquisition in the UK for some time, given that the pay-TV network took a serious look at Channel 4. Ultimately, the British government abandoned plans to sell Channel 4 in January 2023.


	A former Sky executive said the company is constantly exploring ways to bolster its declining and aging customer base, meaning it could view ITV, and its streaming service ITVX, as another shop window for its content, not least sport. Sky remains the biggest home for Premier League football in the UK. “Not everyone who watches ITV watches Sky, but everyone who watches Sky watches ITV,” said an industry observer.


	The former Sky executive pointed to its heavily marketed Essential TV deal — which bundles Sky Atlantic (home to House of the Dragon) with an ad-tier Netflix plan for £15 — as evidence of the company's efforts to reach new subscribers. They said this sort of offer would have been unthinkable, even five years ago. “Sky is like a massive cruise liner with a small hole. It will sink eventually, but maybe ITV plugs this gap a little longer,” the source said. 


	While there is crossover between the ITV audience and Sky subscribers, Tom Harrington, Head of Television at Enders Analysis, said the broader audience will be a much better sell to advertisers. “You'd be enormous in a shrinking market,” he added. “If you have a declining business in many ways and combine it with another [declining] business then suddenly you look a lot bigger. That is better, even if putting them together won't really arrest what they are facing.”


	Another well-placed former Sky insider agreed the deal makes sense if Comcast wants to run Sky and ITV for cash, essentially juicing what remains of declining but still lucrative ad businesses. This person, along with numerous other sources, said there would be significant cost-cutting that could be achieved in slamming the businesses together (broadcasting union Bectu quickly voiced alarm that the deal would have “huge implications” for ITV staff). But ultimately, the former Sky insider came back to an analogy often whispered among bankers who are merging weakening businesses: “Two drunks propping each other up at the bar.”


An Ad Monopoly?


	Other questions linger. There is no guarantee a Sky takeover of ITV would be cleared by regulators. The deal would need to be approved by Ofcom and the Competition Markets Authority. There is confidence this can be achieved, and the UK government has signaled in recent months that it wants to make it easier for broadcasters to come together. 

	











	Nevertheless, Sky and ITV are estimated to cover around 70% of the advertising market, meaning that any deal would certainly raise eyebrows from commercial competitors, not least Paramount-owned 5. “That would be the biggest hurdle,” noted a Sky insider, who said the deal would be the first big test of whether the government will greenlight consolidation.


	Ex-ITV chair Peter Bazalgette, an industry doyen, told BBC Radio 4's Today show that regulators should be flexible, given that ITV is now taking on the likes of Google and Meta in the video advertising space, not just its more immediate rivals like Channel 4. Bazalgette's argument mirrors the one that ITV has begun making to UK lawmakers and regulators.


	There is also the question of the duo's overlapping news businesses. Both are widely respected, but Sky News has been loss-making for years and its current funding guarantee from Comcast — one of the stipulations of the 2018 deal — expires in 2028. A person close to Sky News suggested that the service could end up producing ITV News, which would get Comcast out of a “really difficult decision in 2028,” but would be bad news for current supplier ITN.


	Breaking ITV apart would also lead to questions over the deep ties between its network business and studios arm. “They are so inextricably linked,” said the market observer. “But the terms with which they relate to each other would, of course, become less advantageous and beneficial. So you're buying something that wouldn't be as good as it is now.”


	The assumption from some of our sources is that ITV CEO Carolyn McCall will seek a buyer for the studios business soon after the sale of networks. Banijay and RedBird IMI have held talks, but interest has cooled in recent months. ITV insiders value it at £3.5B, and there is little doubt that it is an attractive asset in a consolidating market.


	ITV, a grand old institution of British broadcasting, recently celebrated its 70th birthday. The company knows better than most that it must adapt to survive. Executives will hope that their courtship with Sky can turn into an enduring union, even if the takeover bid has left some perplexed.


	Sky, ITV, and Comcast declined to comment.

The main thing ITV and Sky have in common is that neither brand has any audience affection. Audiences go to them for specific content but neither commands audience loyalty.

	Jelly Roll has been forced to cancel the final date of his debut Australia and New Zealand tour, citing illness, just hours before the headline show was set to kick off.

	The Grammy-nominated, multi-platinum artist announced via Instagram on Friday (Nov. 8) that he would not be performing at The Outer Fields at Western Springs in Auckland, New Zealand, as originally scheduled for tonight.

	“Dear Auckland, I've done everything I can,” he wrote on Instagram. “I just can't shake it. It breaks my heart, I've probably missed three shows in the last decade. I pride myself on showing up no matter what. Just couldn't do it this time. Please forgive me.”


	Fans reported that they didn't discover news of the cancellation until arriving at the venue. The late notice left many frustrated and disappointed, particularly as some had travelled long distances to attend Jelly Roll's first-ever New Zealand performance.


	The cancelled concert was set to wrap Jelly Roll's tour across Australia and New Zealand, which marked the country-rock star's first-ever visit to the region. The run included back-to-back shows at Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena (Oct. 28–29), a sold-out night at Sydney's Qudos Bank Arena (Nov. 4), and an Adelaide show at AEC Theatre (Oct. 26). He also headlined the inaugural Strummingbird Festival on the Sunshine Coast (Oct. 25), followed by dates in Newcastle (Nov. 1) and Perth (Nov. 2).

	











	In 2023, his album Whitsitt Chapel peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, and in 2024, his follow-up Beautifully Broken debuted at No. 1 — marking his first chart-topping release on the all-genre tally. He has also earned eight consecutive No. 1 singles on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, including fan favourites like “Heart of Stone,” “I Am Not Okay,” and “Liar,” the latter of which held the top spot for six weeks.


	Live Nation have issued a statement on the show's cancellation, saying: “We regret to announce the Jelly Roll Down Under 2025 Tour tonight at The Outer Fields at Western Springs in Auckland will no longer go ahead due to illness.  


	“All ticket holders will receive an automatic full refund. For any further refund enquiries please contact your point of purchase. We thank the fans for their understanding, and we look forward to welcoming Jelly Roll in future.”

	Mod Sun is looking back on his high-profile engagement to Avril Lavigne — and how the fallout helped him grow.


	Appearing on the Nov. 6 episode of Bunnie Xo's Dumb Blonde podcast, the multi-genre artist opened up about the relationship's end with surprising clarity, saying: “We're two different people, but I think I had a great influence on her.” He added that the “Sk8er Boi” singer helped him “grow up,” and that he's now more secure in his identity than ever before.


	The former couple met in early 2021 while collaborating on music, and their joint single “Flames” dropped just weeks later. A whirlwind romance followed, with Mod proposing in Paris in April 2022. Less than a year later, the pair called off the engagement in February 2023.

	Though Lavigne has remained publicly silent on the split, Mod has continued to speak openly. In July 2023, he released the breakup track “Strangers,” with lyrics detailing the rise and fall of their relationship. The Paris-shot music video — filmed in the same city where he proposed — added further emotional weight.


	On the podcast, Mod said that his perspective on the breakup has shifted over time: “We're two different people, but I think I had a great influence on her.” 




	He continued, “Like now, I'm very secure of who I am, because I've been lost in the last three years of wondering, ‘Where do I fit in?'”


	He added later, “If we had done this talk three months ago, I might've been like, ‘F— that person,' but now… If I run into you? It's all love.”


	He also spoke about developing greater empathy in the aftermath, saying, “When someone does you wrong, stop thinking, ‘You did me dirty, and I'm out for revenge.' Step in their position.”


	Lavigne was briefly linked to rapper Tyga following the split, but the pair separated in mid-2023. Mod, meanwhile, focused on his tour and healing. “Being surrounded by love every night on tour has been an absolute blessing,” he wrote on Instagram days after the breakup. “I just know there's a plan for it all.”

In 1956, Robert Zimmerman was a 15-year-old kid, a misfit in his small Midwestern town, and leader of a ragtag rock'n'roll combo who compensated for their lack of technique with boundless enthusiasm. In 1963, Bob Dylan was arguably the most celebrated pop artist in America, whose songs were hailed as standards before he could even record them and whose fans considered him to be a living, breathing manifestation of the American folk impulse. That kid wailing on his band's cover of Shirley & Lee's “Let the Good Times Roll” back in St. Paul, Minnesota, could never have predicted where he'd end up in seven years (he'd not even heard of Odetta or Woody Guthrie yet), and the conquering hero closing out his first sold-out Carnegie Hall performance with a spirited and weirdly prophetic “When the Ship Comes In” had already tried to erase his old self from his biography. He claimed to friends and interviewers and colleagues and onlookers that he was born and raised in New Mexico, ran off with the circus, toured with Conway Twitty, and any other fabulation that crossed his mind, so perhaps he thought those two versions of himself were incompatible. But there was always something of the rocker in the folkie and a bit of the folkie in the rocker.

Through the Open Window, the 18th installment of Dylan's never-ending reissue series, connects these two figures intimately, tracing the artist's seven-year rise across 8 CDs, 165 tracks, and nearly nine hours. It's not the largest Bootleg entry; the collector's edition of The Cutting Edge beats all comers with 18 CDs, while Trouble No More sprawls to as many as 10 CDs. (You want that much mid-'60s electric Dylan, but who besides the most committed Bobophile needs that much born-again Dylan?) Regardless, nothing in the series has the same scope of this new set. Most Bootleg installments drop you into a pivotal moment in Dylan's life, a meaningful year or two, but Through the Open Window covers almost a decade during which he made great strides. It plays less like a box set and more like the audiobook of a Great American Novel: a travelogue from the Midwest to Greenwich Village and a coming-of-age story of an artist hitting young adulthood amid the dreamers and schemers of New York City. It follows Dylan as he hangs out in shabby Manhattan apartments, as he lingers over coffee at Café Wha?, and as he tries out new songs and routines and personae onstage. It follows him into tiny Cue Recording Studio and historic Columbia Studio A, to a poorly attended show at the tiny Carnegie Chapter Hall, and finally to his climactic sold-out show at Carnegie Hall.

Here's a box set where the length is not only justified but an essential part of the experience. It's made for total immersion; whether you're a committed obsessive or merely curious, it's meant to be lived with for a few weeks, part of your daily routine for a while, exactly like a good book. You won't get that experience with the 2xCD highlights edition or even the 4xLP set, which are really just the CliffsNotes versions. So start with the first track and listen for a while. Mark your place and start again later. Ignore other people to keep listening. Imagine those apartments with their thin curtains and bare mattresses on the floor, those clubs with their cigarette smoke and lines of hopefuls waiting for their few minutes on a small stage, those studios with their pristine acoustic tiles and engineers in suits and ties. Listen as Bobby Zimmerman becomes Bob Dylan.

You couldn't write an opening chapter better than pimply Bobby leading his fellow teenagers through “Let the Good Times Roll.” The lo-est of fi, it is barely legible, and there is honestly nothing noteworthy in the performance beyond who is performing. It's exactly the kind of track, however, that works well in the context of a sprawling box set, partly because it's very short (37 seconds) and mostly because it so perfectly sets Zimmerman up as a nobody who becomes somebody. How many teenagers were obsessed with rock'n'roll in 1956? This kid was only one of a couple million. Later, you can hear the moment he learns about folk music and when he begins his defining obsession with Woody Guthrie: The guitars switch from electric to acoustic, there is more strain and gravity in his performances, the sound of someone trying to live up to the songs he's singing. This is when he breaks free of those millions of kids and becomes one of thousands besotted by folk. Where they might have seen the music's history as something that would automatically justify their presence on any stage, Dylan saw that and much more.

These are not lost years in Dylan's life; in fact, they are among the most documented in his biography, thanks to Bootleg Series Vol. 9: The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964, Martin Scorsese's No Direction Home, James Mangold's A Complete Unknown, and even Dylan's own Chronicles Volume One. It's not the most glamorous era, lacking the prickly rebellion of going electric and the gleeful rowdiness of The Basement Tapes, nor is Dylan the most sympathetic of protagonists. His penchant for self-fictionalization during this period is notorious and at times obnoxious—he insisted on the three Ns in his early stage name, Elston Gunnn—but less well known is his wide-eyed wonder, his gawky attention-seeking. This is the guy who carried around The New York Times with Robert Shelton's article about him, which Dylan would read aloud to anyone within earshot. There's a bit of boastful self-regard there, but also a kind of dumbfounded amazement that he actually exists to other people.

Inside of a song, he's an even wilier character, and Through the Open Window reveals an artist trying to find his voice and then convincing others to listen to it. At first he sounds most purposeful when he's playing with other people, such as Danny Kalb, a slightly more experienced musician who adds sharp guitar runs to “East Virginia Blues” and “K.C. Moan.” Even as a session player, he sounds like a perfectionist, always absorbing new tricks and techniques. More telling than his harmonica playing on Harry Belafonte's 1962 cover of Lead Belly's “The Midnight Special” is the tense exchange with producer Hugo Montenegro over a riff Dylan was asked to play on the intro. Belafonte, chill as ever, tells the kid to take his time. He tried so many different things during this era, even working with a jazz combo for a flop single (although their cover of “That's All Right Mama” sounds like a test run for his thin-wild-mercury sound just a few years later). While very few of them stuck, you can hear him learning as he goes.

As he hones his picking and strumming, Dylan gains confidence as a vocalist who knows when to howl or bleat or holler or croon or hang back and be quiet. The sheer force of his voice is no real revelation, but this compilation explores his developing technique in greater depth than any other Dylan set even attempts. Listen to his stark versions of Guthrie's “Pastures of Plenty” and the country song “Remember Me,” both recorded at a friend's home, and marvel at how he seems to be editing his vocals and guitar playing, removing every note but the most essential. Or cue up the various versions of “Blowin' in the Wind,” regarded as his first masterpiece and a hit for Peter, Paul & Mary before he'd even released his own version, and hear how he lets the song be a little slippery, how he revels in what Sean Wilentz in his lengthy liner notes calls its “ambiguous indeterminacy.” Dylan always pushed against his reputation as a protest singer, despite writing some of the greatest protest songs of the rock era, and he sings this song like he's trying to figure it out himself, finally realizing that it means something completely different depending on who's singing it and in what context. Through the Open Window includes that and other songs from his first appearance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1963, back when he wouldn't dare plug in. If he had divided feelings about the venue and his role there, it doesn't come across in his performance, especially when he leads a choir of contemporaries—Joan Baez, Peter, Paul & Mary, the Freedom Singers, and others—in a rousing sing-along. They all sing “Blowin' in the Wind” with a sense of destiny, as though they are making a new world just by singing this song together.

In one of the finest moments of sequencing on this set, the next song up is “Boots of Spanish Leather,” an outtake from the Freewheelin' sessions with Tom Wilson (Dylan would eventually re-record it for The Times They Are A-Changin' in 1964). The contrast between the rousing chorus of “Blowin' in the Wind” and the stillness of “Boots” is jarring enough to bring out new aspects of each song, with “Boots” sounding even lonelier, even more despairing. Written during a trip to Italy as his relationship with Suze Rotolo appeared to be crumbling, it sounds intimate and unguarded, intensely private rather than public; he needs a quiet moment to himself in order to rouse an audience with his friends.

Though known in folk circles, Dylan was still struggling to find a larger audience and break through to the pop market. He signed with Columbia in late 1961, which is roughly where Act II begins. He recorded his self-titled debut with John Hammond producing, but it was not the breakout anyone expected. Here's where you might want to place your bookmark and give that album another listen, just to get a feel for how this young man presented himself to the world; unexpectedly, Bob Dylan might work better as an addendum to this bulky novel than as a standalone release. Even Dylan considered it a failure, both commercially and creatively, and he was moving so fast that these traditional tunes and talking blues were old news by the time it was released.

His follow-up, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, did not come easy. He worked through a series of aimless sessions over several months, finally piecemealing an album that wasn't too dissimilar from his debut. At the last minute Columbia decided that “Talkin' John Birch Society Paranoid Blues” was potentially libelous and removed it from the album. Dylan was irate, but it worked out in his favor, as it gave him a chance to quickly record several new songs and redo about half the album, including “Girl from the North Country” and “Masters of War”—two of his best compositions from the era. The new tracklist sharpened his Cold War fears while also introducing more intimate struggles, in particular his insecurities about Rotolo. The album toggles gracefully between the public and the private, each lending weight to the other, which contributes to its status as Dylan's breakthrough as well as just one of the best folk albums ever made.

Through the Open Window could end there, with Freewheelin' hailed as a masterpiece that sealed his reputation with the folkies while bringing folk music to a larger audience. But that album is merely the set-up for the set's cinematic climax at Carnegie Hall, which takes up the last two discs. The crowd sounds rowdier than expected, bringing their basket-house manners to this grander venue and seemingly cutting short his introduction to “A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall” with their applause. He brings so many different Dylans to the stage: the outraged protest singer (“The Times They Are A-Changin'”), the lovelorn poet (“Boots of Spanish Leather”), the talkin' bluesman (“Talkin' World War III Blues”), the guy scared of nuclear annihilation (“Masters of War”), and the artist who's over it all (a rambling story about the film Hootenanny Hoot and the commercialization of the folk movement).

This Bootleg installment ends with Dylan triumphant, hailed as a hero and a new kind of pop star: not merely an entertainer but an artist. Of course, it wouldn't be long before many of his applauding fans were jeering at him, calling him a traitor for plugging in and writing such inscrutable lyrics. Through the Open Window gestures toward the rest of the story, toward everything that has happened in the past 62 years. Dylan has always had a strained relationship with this early material, especially those topical songs, and sometimes he kicks against them and sometimes he embraces their possibilities. During these seven years Robert Zimmerman discovered he could be Bob Dylan and Bob Dylan discovered he could be just about anybody. Anything was possible and nothing was certain, and this might be the only time in his life when that was true.

A representative for actor Jeremy Renner has issued a denial of claims made against the Hawkeye star by filmmaker Yi Zhou, who has alleged that Renner sent her unsolicited nude photographs of himself, and later threatened to call ICE on her when the pair's relationship soured.

This is per Rolling Stone, reporting on a long series of Instagram posts from Zhou, who also gave an interview to The Daily Mail about her alleged relationship with Renner. Which, per the artist, model, and filmmaker, began when he solicited her with nude pictures via social media earlier this year, and eventually saw the two collaborate, at least in part, on Zhou's documentary Chronicles Of Disney. (As far as we can tell, the film was released last month, and is built off of interviews conducted with a fairly small collection of people affiliated with the company—including a very noted inclusion of Renner himself in its marketing materials.) Zhou says things soured with Renner after he refused to promote the film, including a request from her that he publicly disavow that the film had been generated with AI. (Zhou is also currently producing an AI-animated film, titled Stardust Future, that Renner was reportedly involved in.) “When I called him out privately about his past misconduct and asked him to behave properly,” Zhou wrote in one of several posts that she's made public since Monday, “To respect me as a woman and as a filmmaker, he threatened to call immigration/ICE on me, an act that deeply shocked and frightened me.”

Per Rolling Stone, a representative for Renner has called the allegations against the actor “totally inaccurate and untrue.” Zhou's account currently includes a number of pictures posted as “receipts,” including candid photographs that appear to show Renner, and screenshots of a text conversation allegedly showing him making a threat to call immigration on Zhou.

	As artificial intelligence becomes less discernible and more prevalent, Vince Gilligan is setting an example about transparency in Hollywood.


	The Pluribus creator, whose new show premiered the first two episodes Friday on Apple TV+, made sure to note in the credits of the post-apocalyptic sci-fi series that the production did not rely on AI.


	“This show was made by humans,” reads the credits, following a list of acknowledgments from the producers.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In Pluribus, Rhea Seehorn plays Albuquerque author Carol Sturka, one of 12 people on Earth who is immune to an extraterrestrial virus that transforms everyone in the world into a relentlessly optimistic hive mind.

	











	Gilligan previously slammed AI as he discussed the series. “I have not used ChatGPT, because as of yet, no one has held a shotgun to my head and made me do it,” he told Polygon.


	“I will never use it. No offense to anyone who does,” added Gilligan. “I really wasn't thinking about AI [when I wrote Pluribus], because this was about eight or 10 years ago.”


	Meanwhile, Coca-Cola has faced backlash this week for another AI-generated holiday campaign, and the entertainment industry has expressed concern over AI creations like Tilly Norwood replacing human actors and other crew members.

It's time for the WGA and all writers to stop viewing AI as the bogeyman.  It has it's uses – and they are allmost all non-creative uses – that are no different than a word processor or grammar check only more sophisticated.  This conversation has been totally hypocritical.  Is AI potentially problematic? Yep.  But writers should be the test pilots and not the scared sheep – like in the space program.  Saying something was made by humans is facile: AI was made by humans.  Embracing technology is necessary and a little scary.  If we switch the power dynamic we may find the tech useful.  Not to replace, but to aid.  It seems strangely dystopian to use all technologies in your art-form except one because fools started a narrative based on fear. Does Vince Gilligan write with Final Draft, or is he sitting in a log cabin by candlelight with a feather and ink?  Enough with the fear – own the tech, use it, exploit it.  Ideas are the key, hard work is the engine. AI is a tool. The power is ours IF we make the choice to control it.

Yes! This made me like it more!

The fact that you have to specify in the credits that a show wasn't made using AI means it's indistinguishable and you know it, otherwise there wouldn't have been any need. Good luck with that.

Completely disagree. It feels like virtue signaling to include because guess what, AI still sucks and they couldn't have made this with AI even if they wanted to. We give too much power to the narrative by making it seem like AI even could replace artists yet. It can't. It can create incredibly short, bad, uncanny valley clips, and it can clean up your incoherent work emails. The stuff AI can actually be meaningfully used for on a film right now would not infringe on real human work, and is mostly digital clean up and effects stuff. Who cares?

Ted Lasso and Shrinking star Brett Goldstein has landed his latest streaming project (on both the acting and the creative sides) as Deadline reports that Goldstein has just secured a Prime Video landing spot for his new series Escorted. As the title implies, the series centers on Goldstein, playing what we're going to go ahead and assume will be some variant of a Brett Goldstein type—i.e., a divorced dad who (we're guessing) has a gruff exterior covering massive amounts of silliness—who “accidentally becomes a male escort.”

And while it's not clear, at present, how many other plotlines the show will pull from the rich oeuvre of Rob Schneider's Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo duology—will a very large fishtank, perhaps, feature heavily?—the show does have a pretty good creative pedigree. That most especially includes Goldstein, who will write, produce, and star in the series, alongside Shrinking collaborator Brian Gallivan. The series, which has been given a direct-to-series order at Prime Video, is being produced at Warner Bros. Studios, with Amazon's Amazon MGM studios as a co-producer.

Among other things, the series represents Goldstein's first big solo push since Ted Lasso introduced his stoic, thoughtful take on comedy to the masses on both sides of the pond—including the fact that that he's clearly just as enthusiastic about working as a writer as as an actor. (He previously co-created, but never appeared in, a science-fiction anthology show, Soulmates, which debuted on AMC back in 2020, just as Lasso was first taking off. The series ran for a single season.) Escorted has been ordered for an eight-episode first season, and will reportedly be a “romantic comedy about second chances, the mayhem of co-parenting, and whether real intimacy can ever be bought”—none of which, if memory serves, were ever addressed directly by the Deuce Bigalow films, so there's clearly some creative room left here to explore.

Olivia Rodrigo is making it clear that she is not happy with the Trump administration (and his Department of Homeland Security) using her music to promote their policies. On Friday, the pop singer slammed the White House and DHS for posting a video about self-deportation using one of her songs.


	A video posted to Instagram on Tuesday opened with the chaotic, rock part of her Guts favorite “All-American Bitch” showing clips of ICE agents detaining undocumented immigrants with the caption “If ICE finds you,” and then undocumented immigrants seemingly choosing to self-deport with the softer, more peaceful part of the song that follows.


	“LEAVE NOW and self-deport using the CBP Home app,” read the DHS post's caption. “If you don't, you will face the consequences.”


	In a comment that has since been deleted (although it's unclear if by Rodrigo or DHS), Rodrigo wrote, “Don't ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda.” Since its deletion, fans of Rodrigo have been copy/pasting her original message to remind viewers of Rodrigo's take.

	











	In response to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment on the matter, a DHS spokesperson said, “America is grateful all the time for our federal law enforcement officers who keep us safe. We suggest Ms. Rodrigo thank them for their service, not belittle their sacrifice.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Rodrigo has been a loud voice against Trump's policies and racist approach to immigration enforcement. When ICE started targeting Angelenos in mass raids back in June, Rodrigo shared an Instagram story condemning deportations.

	











	“I've lived in L.A. my whole life and I'm deeply upset about these violent deportations of my neighbors under the current administration,” Rodrigo wrote. “L.A. simply wouldn't exist without immigrants. Treating hardworking community members with such little respect, empathy, and due process is awful.”

	Marvel star Jeremy Renner is facing accusations that he sent unsolicited “intimate” photos and video to a Chinese filmmaker and threatened to “call ICE” on her after she “called him out privately” on alleged misconduct.


	Filmmaker and artist Yi Zhou, director of the documentary Chronicles of Disney featuring Renner, made the allegations in a series of Instagram posts and in an in-depth interview with the Daily Mail. Zhou, 38, alleges she had a personal and professional relationship with Renner, 54, that left her fearing for her safety.


	“Mr. Renner first contacted me directly in June, sending personal and intimate photographs of himself, behavior that, according to public reports, he has exhibited before,” she wrote on Instagram. She claims Renner wooed her over calls and text discussions, saying he wanted a relationship. Zhou alleges they started dating and working together on two projects, including Chronicles of Disney, and that Renner “appears in 80% of the film.” She claims that when the documentary was released last month, Renner “refused to make any public promotion,” despite allegedly having entered into written agreements with her Italian production company, Into the Sun Films. Zhou says she appealed to Renner to help her combat fan accounts falsely claiming the documentary was generated by AI without his consent, but he purportedly refused.

	











	“When I called him out privately about his past misconduct and asked him to behave properly, to respect me as a woman and as a filmmaker, he threatened to call immigration/ICE on me, an act that deeply shocked and frightened me,” she wrote. “Such behavior is unacceptable and emblematic of the imbalance of power that continues to harm women in our industry.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	A rep for the actor called the allegations “totally inaccurate and untrue.” The Marvel actor has not commented publicly.


	In her interview with the Daily Mail, Zhou claimed it was Renner who pursued her. “I did not reach out to him,” she said. “I didn't even know his name, never watched a movie of his. He used me and denied me and denied our work.” She shared a screenshot of a pornographic image that Renner allegedly sent to her via WhatsApp in June.


	She went on to claim that one night in August, Renner drank a bottle of wine and yelled at her for two hours during a work meeting at his house. Zhou claimed she had to “lock” herself in a room, “scared for [her] life.”

	Renner nearly died in a snow plow accident on New Year's Day 2023. He recounted the accident — which left him in critical condition — in a Diane Sawyer interview a few months later. “I chose to survive. That's not gonna kill me, no way,” Renner said.


	The actor previously was married to Canadian model and actress Sonni Pacheco. During a bitter child custody battle, Pacheco accused him of substance abuse and threatening to kill her.

	With Stranger Things embarking on its final season, Millie Bobby Brown is leaving behind-the-scenes rumors in the Upside Down.


	While reuniting with co-star David Harbour at Thursday's Season 5 premiere, the 2x Emmy nominee raved that she's “so lucky” to have her onscreen dad in her life for nearly a decade since the Netflix show premiered.


	“It's been amazing. We're so lucky to have each other,” Brown told Extra. “The show means so much to the both of us, and to everyone here. This has been the last 10 years of our lives.”

	Despite reports to the contrary, the pair seemed to get along great as they shared a hug and a laugh while posing together on the red carpet Thursday at TCL Chinese Theatre, ahead of the Part One premiere Nov. 26 on Netflix.

	











	Netflix shared a video to Instagram of the pair celebrating “one last Stranger Things premiere” after the Duffer Brothers' show premiered in 2016.

	Brown stars in Stranger Things as the psychic-powered Eleven, who escapes Hawkins National Laboratory in Season 1, where she was subject to experiments with the Upside Down. After escaping the facility, Harbour's Jim Hopper ends up adopting her.


	Season 5 continues in the fall of 1987. Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, with the characters united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished — his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will's disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming — and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they've faced before. To end this nightmare, they'll need everyone — the full party — standing together, one last time.

	











	The highly anticipated fifth and final season will release on Netflix across three premiere dates with Volume 1 on November 26 (four episodes), Volume 2 on Christmas (three episodes), and The Finale on New Year's Eve. Each volume releases at 5 PM PT.

No broke boys? No new friends?


													By
												

	Katie Bain



	The nominations for the 68th annual Grammy Awards were announced Friday morning (Nov. 7), with the Recording Academy once again recognizing the dance/electronic genre across four categories: best dance electronic recording, best dance/electronic album, best dance pop recording and best remixed recording.


	These categories welcome back a list of familiar faces, specifically in Fred again.., Kaytranada, Disclosure and Skrillex. These artists have tallied a combined 49 nominations and 13 wins, with Skrillex arguably being the Academy's most loved dance artist, with his nine wins going back to 2012. (Meanwhile Fred again.. has two awards, as does Kaytranda, while Disclosure has been iced out of any wins thus far during their storied career.)


	This repeat pool of nominations suggests that the Grammys have found a cadre of dance/electronic artists that are not only worthy, but with whom the Academy feels comfortable returning to again and again. Fred, Skrillex, Kaytranada and Disclosure make up nearly the entire dance/electronic recording category, which is rounded out by Tame Impala's “End of Summer,” a worthy track that carves out space for recognition of the artist's new electronic-focused album Deadbeat, which was released after the 2026 eligibility window closed.


	Elsewhere, the categories bring in less frequently nominated artists, including FKA twigs and PinkPantheress, both welcome sights to see nominated for dance/electronic album, a category that also includes fellow Grammy favs Rüfüs du Sol, a group that's aggregated six nominations and one win over its career.


	While none of these nominations comes as a true shock, being that there are only five slots in each category, as always, there were also a few surprises sprinkled across the categories. Here are some of the biggest snubs and surprises in the dance/electronic nominations for the 68th annual Grammy Awards.


	The culture-permeating earworm that unseated Marshmello and Kane Brown's “Miles on It” from its long reign at No. 1 on Hot Dance/Electronic songs seemed like an obvious choice for a best dance pop recording nominee. “No Broke Boys,” the dance world's unofficial song of the summer, started as an edit heard during Disco Lines' set at EDC Las Vegas in May, getting an official release as a new single with fresh vocals from Tinashe that meshed her 2024 original with Disco Lines' bouncy beat. But just as the song's lyrics go, in terms of 2026 Grammy recognition, there were indeed “no new friends.”


	The Chicago-born producer and bona fide global phenom was shut out of the 2025 Grammys during his breakout year — a year during which he also released his Grammys-eligible debut album Comfort in Chaos. The academy might have made up for the snub with a 2026 nod, particularly given that Summit's eligible January track “Focus” featuring Cloves marked some of his best and most mature work to date. But even as Summit headlines actual football stadiums, he's apparently and surprisingly still not a focus for the academy.


	The dance world rejoiced when Jamie xx released In Waves, his long-awaited follow-up to his 2015 classic In Colour, in September 2024. While this latter album was nominated for best dance/electronic album in 2016, In Waves didn't get that acknowledgement, a snub considering how well the project was received and how great it is. With In Waves singles also being submitted for best dance/electronic recording, it's surprising that voters didn't manage to carve out any space for the project or the beloved producer, especially as the academy makes Grammy darlings out of fellow left-of-center indie dance producers like Fred again.. and Kaytranada.


	We're not surprised that the Canadian-Haitian producer is nominated in best dance/electronic recording this year, as anything Kaytra does has the Midas touch. The surprise is that the producer is only nominated for best dance/electronic recording for “Space Invader,” given that the album that the track comes from, Ain't No Damn Way! is excellent start to finish. One wonders the factors weighed by voters as they sent a single from the album through to the nominations pool, but not the album it came from.


	The Australian producer specializes in, and in fact helped form, the kind of slinky, acid-ey new wave of tech house that's been one of the dance world's dominant genres for the past several years. One would think that voters might acknowledge Dolla for that contribution, particularly as his hypnotic February single with Daya, “Dreamin',” was rinsed by DJs around the world this year. This accomplishment happened in tandem with the producer rising to festival headliner status while also pushing his name and dance music at large further into mainstream consciousness via his A+ contribution to the F1 The Album film soundtrack, “No Room for a Saint.” But at the 2026 Grammys there was apparently indeed no room.


	Amid her breakout year, the dance world favorite released some of her finest work to date on her 2024 album Dotr. Exploring the experience of grief in a way few artists are able or willing to do, a nomination for the album would have further established the Oregon-born, Texas-based and fully globe-trotting artist as a dance world force, although she'll no doubt continue being so without the nod.


	Pop divas are no stranger to the dance categories, with Britney Spears, Madonna, Beyoncé, Cher, Rihanna, Lady Gaga and more making appearances in the dance/electronic album and dance/electronic recording categories since they were introduced in 2005 and 1998, respectively. But never has queen diva Mariah Carey shown up in these categories, until now. Kaytanada's slinky, sexy remix of Carey's 2005 anthem “Don't Forget About Us” brings Carey (who has five Grammy wins to her name) to the dance field, also marking the first remix from UMG's catalog division UMe to ever be nominated.


	Longtime dance world fav Chris Lake did get a 2026 nomination for his boss remix of The Chemical Brothers' “Galvanize,” but one thought he might also get the nod for best dance/electronic album for his July LP Chemistry, his first ever studio album after a more than 20-year career. Apparently the project, excellent start to finish, didn't quite alchemize with voters.


	Perhaps it's not actually that much of a surprise, but three years into its existence the best dance pop recording category is basically entirely dominated by pop stars, with Zara Larsson, Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco, Tate McRae, PinkPantheress and Lady Gaga getting 2026 nominations. Given that the dance/electronic fields have historically under-recognized female producers, seeing female artists dominate this category is a welcome development, although this category more and more feels like a space for bona fide pop stars who don't totally inhabit the dance world to just submit their most dance-centric output.


	The Australian producer is in the midst of her breakout moment, an achievement she's been working towards for years and which she has finally and deservedly realized with her August album I Love My Computer, easily one of the year's best dance/electronic albums. Awards in her home country have met this moment, with Ninajirachi being nominated for a host of Australian awards including the ARIA Awards,  the NSW Music Prize and the Australian Music Prize, the latter of which she won this week. A Grammy nomination would've brought her breakout buzz to a new level while delivering some fresh energy to the nomination fields, but alas, no love.

What began as an already unforgettable moment at this year's Wacken Open Air turned legendary when Michael Schenker stunned tens of thousands of fans with a major announcement. Following a blistering My Years With UFO set on Thursday night, the hard rock icon revealed that his new Michael Schenker Group studio album, ‘Don't Sell Your Soul,' is out now via earMUSIC. To top it off, Schenker and his band premiered the album's title track live for the first time, closing their set with a powerful encore that electrified the festival grounds.

Earlier in the night, the Wacken faithful were treated to another surprise as Slash joined Schenker onstage for a searing rendition of the UFO classic “Mother Mary.” Two generations of guitar gods sharing the same stage — it was the kind of moment destined to live forever in metal lore.

‘Don't Sell Your Soul' marks the latest studio album from the Michael Schenker Group and the second part of a trilogy that began with 2024's My Years With UFO. Produced by Schenker and Michael Voss, the album features longtime collaborators Bodo Schopf (drums), Barend Courbois (bass), and Steve Mann (guitar, keys), with Erik Gronwall on lead vocals and guest appearances by Robin McAuley, Dimitri “Lia” Liapakis, and Voss. Available now on CD, LP, and limited transparent red vinyl, the record is a fiery testament to Schenker's unrelenting creative spirit and guitar mastery.

METHUEN — City Council chair Ron Marsan agreed this week to go on a scavenger hunt of sorts at the historic Searles Estate along with other city officials.

The goal is to track down the dozens of artifacts at the estate and clear up a rumor referenced publicly by Councilor Neily Soto that items may have been taken from the premises after the city bought it.

A new analysis of surface temperature readings from NASA's Cassini Mission has determined that Saturn's moon Enceladus is losing heat from both poles.

The study, conducted by researchers from Oxford University, the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), and the Planetary Science Institute (PSI), overturns previous assumptions that Enceladus was only losing heat from its active South Pole, thereby increasing the odds that the icy moon could support biological activity.

“This stability means Enceladus' ocean could have existed for a long-term, potentially giving life a chance to have evolved,” explained the study's lead author, Dr Georgina Miles from SwRI and Visiting Scientist at the Department of Physics, University of Oxford, and study co-author, Oxford Prof. Carly Howett, also from the PRI, in an email to The Debrief.

The research team behind the new analysis also described Enceladus as “a top contender for extra-terrestrial life,” because it has heat, liquid water, and the right chemicals, such as complex hydrocarbons and phosphorus, needed for life on Earth. The researchers also told The Debrief that future missions to Enceladus could reveal critical data about the moon's age and the age of its subsurface ocean, which is necessary to confirm its potential habitability.

Although researchers have suspected for some time that Enceladus' ocean might support life, its long-term stability, which is required for life to evolve, has remained in question. This stability can only exist if its energy losses and gains remain in balance.

For example, if the moon's squeezing and stretching caused by Saturn's gravity creates too little energy, the surface activity would slow or even stop, resulting in the sub-surface ocean freezing. Conversely, if this gravity-induced tidal activity generates too much heat, the ocean's activity would increase, which the researchers note would also dramatically alter its environment.

To determine if the ocean could stay stable over the geological timescales needed for life to develop, the researchers examined surface temperature data captured by Cassini between 2005 and 2017.

“We used north polar late winter observations (when the north pole was in winter darkness) and summer observations permanent daylight) for this study,” Dr. Miles and Prof. Howett told The Debrief.

The researchers said using data captured by Cassini during the moon's deep winter (2005) and deep summer (2015) was important because heat conducted through the surface ice shell during the winter might be mistaken for the pole still cooling down from the summer. However, they note, this “wouldn't be the case” for observations collected in summer.

“Observations from both seasons were required to rule that out,” they explained, adding that warmer regions were “easier to spot” when the moon's surface is at its coldest.

According to a statement detailing the research, the team used this data to create expected surface temperature models during the polar night and compare them against infrared observations captured by Cassini's Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS). These models revealed that the surface of the North Pole, which had previously been considered inactive, was approximately seven times warmer than previous models had predicted.  The team said this discrepancy could only be explained if the sub-surface ocean was leaking heat through the icy shell.

Dr. Miles and Prof. Howett told The Debrief that the moon's maximum total outgoing heat “is comparable to the best current estimates” of Enceladus' tidal heating rate. In short, the heat generated and lost are a close match. The team said this finding indicates it might be possible for the sub-surface ocean to be maintained in liquid form “so long as its orbit around Saturn remains stable.”

“With current theories about ‘tidal locking,' this is entirely possible,” they added.

In the study's conclusion, the researchers suggest that a better understanding of Enceladus' age would help constrain the duration of its subsurface ocean's likely existence in liquid form. Dr. Miles and Prof. Howett told The Debrief that the age of all of Saturn's moons is “highly uncertain,” and noted that Enceladus “is particularly difficult to age” because it has been continually resurfaced by alternating heating and cooling episodes throughout its icy shell.

“The fate of the moon is tied to the evolution of Saturn and its interior structure,” they said, adding that “Enceladus could be up to 1 billion years old, or as young as 150 million years, with current best estimates of 200-450 million years old.” For comparison, the Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old.

When asked about any potential experiments that could help confirm the habitability of Enceladus' ocean, the researchers said one viable method would involve in situ measurements of the size and composition of the nanoparticles previously observed by Cassini in the plumes ejected into space from the moon's south pole. These readings could be used to “provide limits” on how long they've been at the rock-ocean interface, they explained, while also noting that “a lot of laboratory work is needed to verify this too.”

When discussing what tools or missions are necessary to confirm the moon's potential habitability, the team said their work directly highlighted the need for long-term missions to ocean worlds like Enceladus that may harbor life, “and the fact [that] the data might not reveal all its secrets until decades after it has been obtained.”

“Our estimates of the energy balance will be significantly improved by future missions to Enceladus,” Dr. Miles and Prof. Howett told The Debrief.

Only one mission is currently selected to return to Enceladus, the European Space Agency's next Large Class L4 mission. However, they said several more missions “are in the proposal stage.”

“The best information comes from Enceladus' polar regions, which are hard to view from Earth-based observing systems,” the researchers told The Debrief. “You really need to return there to observe Enceladus with a modern instruments suite to understand its habitability potential.”

The study “Endogenic heat at Enceladus' north pole” was published in Science Advances.

Comic Book Questions Answered is a feature where I answer whatever questions you folks might have about comic books (feel free to e-mail questions to me at brianc@cbr.com). Today, I will try to figure out where the new Supernatural comic book series is set.

There is an old joke that goes:

A Scout Master was teaching his boy scouts about survival in the desert. "What are the three most important things you should bring with you in case you get lost in the desert?" he asked. Several hands went up, and many important things were suggested such as food, matches, etc.

Then one little boy in the back eagerly raised his hand. "Yes Timmy, what are the three most important things you would bring with you?" asked the Scout Master. Timmy replied: "A compass, a canteen of water, and a deck of cards." "Why's that Timmy?" "Well," answered Timmy, "the compass is to find the right direction, the water is to prevent dehydration..." "And what about the deck of cards?" asked the Scout Master impatiently. "Well, Sir, as soon as you start playing Solitaire, someone is bound to come up behind you and say, "Put that red nine on top of that black ten!"

I thought of that joke when I noted just HOW many people repeated the same thing about the new Supernatural comic book series, specifically this part about the description of the series in the solicitation:

THE BROTHERS WINCHESTER RETURN!

Get ready to hit the road again with Dean and Sam as they prowl the highways and byways of small-town America in search of demonic wrongdoing to put right!

Set between the foundational first and second seasons of the landmark television series, this brand-new title from acclaimed author GREG PAK (Darth Vader, Lilo & Stitch) and preternaturally gifted artist EDER MESSIAS (Sam Wilson: Captain America) brings readers back to where the dark magic first began - and reveals a disturbing new threat that the bickering brothers will have to face before they can return to hunting down the demon who killed their mother.

As COUNTLESS people pointed out, the comic book COULDN'T be set between the first and second seasons. Okay, so when IS the comic book set?

 Simply put, the reason why the comic book series can't be set between the first and second season is that there ISN'T a gap between the first and second seasons. The final episode of Season 1 ends on a cliffhanger. Sam and Dean Winchester's father, John, is captured, and the brothers have to go save their dad.

However, after they save him, it is revealed that the demon Azazel has possessed John. John tells Sam to kill Azazel (and thus, in the process, kill him, as well), but Sam can't bring himself to do it, and instead shoots his possessed father in the leg, which forces Azazel to leave John's body. The brothers then drive their wounded father to the hospital, but their iconic Impala is then blindsided by a semi-truck being driven by a demonically possessed truck driver.

The second season picks up right after the accident, with the Winchesters being taken to a hospital. John ultimately sacrifices himself to save Dean's life (John and Sam had gotten through the accident with minor injuries, but Dean was stuck in a coma). So clearly, the stories in this series CAN'T take place between Seasons 1 and 2.

Notably, though, writer Greg Pak gave at least one interview with the Cryptid Creator Corner in the lead-up to the release of the series where he noted that the comic book was actually set towards the end of the first season (specifically, he said, "We're setting our stories basically near the end of the first season, when it was really a monster of the week show with these guys on the road and every episode is a self-contained story with new locations, new characters, and a new monster"), and that, of course, is where the series really HAS to be set.

The key scene in the first issue (by writer Greg Pak, artist Eder Messias, colorist Thyago Brandao, and letterer Jeff Eckleberry) is when Sam and Dean talk about not knowing where their dad is. Clearly, since Sam and Dean ARE hunting together, the stories have to take place IN the first season (as opposed to being a prequel), so it is just a matter of figuring out which episode it would have to be for them not to know where their father was.

Okay, so it can't be set in the Season 1 finale, "Devil's Trap," and it can't be in the episode BEFORE that, "Salvation," since that one leads directly into the finale. John is a major character in the 20th episode, "Dead Man's Blood," so it can't be set after that one.

John sends his sons a message in Episode 18, "Something Wicked," and could at least ARGUE that him getting a message to them doesn't preclude them from not knowing where he is, but I think it is likely safer to just go before that episode. The 17th episode doesn't have any John in it, but Episode 16 DOES, so we have to rule that one out, as well.

So I think the safest bet is to say that the series is set after the 15th episode of Season 1, "The Benders." Not only does it fit the timeline where they don't know where their father is (but AFTER their father let them know that their mother was killed by a demon in Episode 11's "Scarecrow"), but it is also set in Minnesota, while the comic book is set in Wisconsin, so that seems to line up pretty well, as well.

So there ya go, folks, I'm going with the comic book series being set between Episodes 15 and 16 in Season 1 (but anywhere after Episode 11 and before Episode 16 is at least a POSSIBILE answer).

Alien buffs are scratching their heads after footage emerged of what seems to be a UFO hovering over an active volcano.

The video, captured by a webcam, shows the eerie glowing object floating above the crater before it suddenly zooms off at high speeds. The suspected extraterrestrial craft seemed to be observing the smoking crater as smoke and flames shot into the sky.

This strange event was recorded by surveillance cameras at the Popocatepetl volcano in the states of Puebla and Morelos in Mexico on Thursday, October 30, reports the Daily Star. 

Popocatepetl, standing at an altitude of 17,802 feet (5,426 meters), is one of Mexico's most active volcanoes.

As of now, officials have not commented on the origin of the mysterious airborne object.

The National Center for Disaster Prevention reported 19 low-intensity eruptions accompanied by vapor, gases, and small amounts of ash on the day in question.

They urged the public to keep their distance from the crater and respect the 12-kilometer exclusion zone.

Last year, UFO expert Jaime Maussan, 72, suggested that Popocatepetl is functioning as an "inter-dimensional portal," a gateway in space-time that allows intergalactic travelers to enter one place from another.

He pointed out that no man-made object could enter the crater as temperatures reach around 1,000 degrees Celsius, as reported by What's the Jam.

Maussan elaborated: "The University of Bergen in Norway discovered that under the volcano there are magnetic storms necessary to be able to generate X-points " or regions of electron diffusion " and be used to create a Dimensional Portal."

X-points are unique locations where Earth's magnetic field connects with the Sun's, creating a direct path from our planet to the Sun's atmosphere, a staggering 93 million miles away.

These points are dubbed as X-points due to the intertwining of the Sun's magnetic force with that of the Earth, forming an 'X' shape.

Manav Kaul as Ridwaan Sayyid, Bhasha Sumbli as Gulnaar Sayyid 

Warning: This post contains spoilers for Baramulla.Set in December 2016, against the snow-covered landscapes of Kashmir, Baramulla begins as a police mystery but unfolds into a haunting reflection on faith, trauma, and redemption. The story follows DSP Ridwaan Sayyed (Manav Kaul), a police officer transferred to the quiet town of Baramulla to investigate a string of child disappearances. Along with his wife Gulnaar (Bhasha Sumbli) and their children Noorie (Arista Mehta) and Ayaan (Rohaan Singh), he moves into an old, abandoned house—unaware that it holds memories of bloodshed and spirits that have yet to find peace.As the investigation deepens, Baramulla reveals that the real mystery lies not only in the streets but within the walls of the house—and in the conscience of those who try to bury the past.Let's break down all the major plotlines in Netflix's film Baramulla, premiering on Nov. 7.

The house that Ridwaan and his family move into once belonged, decades earlier, to a Kashmiri Pandit family, the Saprus: Kamalanand, his wife Mansi, and their children Eela and Sharad. The Pandits, a Hindu minority who lived for centuries in the predominantly Muslim region of Kashmir, were targets of persecution and a broader campaign of mass displacement in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when militant separatist groups began demanding both the region's independence and its conversion into an Islamic state.During that period, thousands of Pandit families were forced to flee their homes in the valley, while others were killed by extremists. Baramulla revisits this painful chapter by situating the Sapru family massacre within this context: the house was invaded by militants, who murdered Kamalanand first, followed by Mansi and Eela, after Eela's best friend, Zainab—who was in the house at the time—revealed their location to the armed men. Only Sharad, who was away during the attack, survived, but even he disappeared shortly afterward.The tragedy turned the house into a place of eternal mourning. The souls of the Saprus—especially those of Eela and Mansi—remain trapped there, reliving the trauma of their deaths. The film shows how these spirits manifest through white flowers that appear before each child's disappearance in the present day.

At first, Ridwaan believes that local extremists have abducted the missing children to recruit them as soldiers. But as the investigation unfolds, he discovers that the truth is far more complicated.The first case involves Shoaib Ansari, the son of an influential former politician, Ismail Ansari. Shoaib vanishes during a magic show, moments after stepping inside the magician's box on stage. Soon after, another boy, Faizal, disappears while fishing at a lake. The tension escalates when Ridwaan's own daughter, Noorie, mysteriously vanishes at home—and before his eyes, another boy, Yassir, is swallowed by a tree that morphs into a dark portal.These children are being targeted by extremists Khalid and Juneid—the latter being Yassir's uncle—who plan to recruit and indoctrinate them into their militant movement, manipulating vulnerable youth with promises of faith and belonging under the orders of a mysterious leader known as Bhaijaan. Yet before the recruitment can take place, the children vanish after touching white tulips seen near the crime scenes.Those flowers are the mark of the Sapru spirits, who rescue the children before they can be captured. Taken to a spiritual realm, the children remain asleep and safe from the extremists' influence. The film, in a striking inversion of horror tropes, reveals that the ghosts aren't the kidnappers—they're the saviors.

In the final act, Baramulla ties all its threads together. Juneid and his men storm Ridwaan's house in retaliation, believing the police officer is hiding the missing children. Chaos erupts as the house—already marked by a massacre decades earlier—once again becomes the stage for violence, and the past literally repeats itself.During the assault, the Sapru spirits intervene to protect the Sayyed family, killing most of the extremists. Juneid, however, manages to escape, taking Zainab—revealed to be the same Zainab who betrayed the Saprus in the 1990s and now a teacher at Blooming Petals Public School, where all the missing children studied—as a hostage. She had gone to the Sayyed home earlier that day to say she'd been receiving threats from militants.Surrounded by police, Juneid demands a clear path to flee. In that moment, Gulnaar, now possessed by the spirit of Mansi, shoots Zainab from the second floor, while Ridwaan kills Juneid. Only after the gunfire subsides does the truth come out: Ridwaan uses Juneid's phone to call Bhaijaan, but it's Zainab's phone that starts ringing. She herself is Bhaijaan, the extremist leader who used her position as a teacher to identify and recruit vulnerable children.After Juneid and Zainab's deaths, the children who had mysteriously vanished begin to reappear in the very same places where they were last seen—unharmed, as if awakening from a long dream.

In the final minutes, Ridwaan is celebrated for solving the case. He and his family leave Baramulla and move elsewhere. Six months later, in Mumbai, the film shows Ayaan handing a small box of seashells to an older man—the same keepsake that once belonged to young Eela Sapru. The man is Sharad Sapru, the sole survivor of the massacre. In tears, he holds the box and stares into the distance, in one of the most emotional moments of the film.

The ending closes on a note of spiritual reconciliation: the Sapru spirits finally seem at peace after decades of unrest. Baramulla ultimately transcends its supernatural thriller form to become a parable about guilt, faith, and collective memory. By merging horror and political trauma, the film transforms its ghosts into metaphors for Kashmir itself—a land where the past is never buried, only silenced, and where true liberation depends on acknowledging the pain of all sides.
