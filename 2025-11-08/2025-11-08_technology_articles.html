I think targeting texting + social media is the right approach. Jon Caramanica records pop music reviews for the New York Times while driving. That's what the hands free laws in most states addressed- using a cellphone while driving became a primary offense, something you could be pulled over for or ticketed for even if you hadn't done anything else wrong.The ultimate goal is to stop people from distracted driving before they cause an accident, but it's not always easy to see who should be stopped and who shouldn't, so a lot of people get away with it anyway.

People get pulled over all the time for obvious distractions. The Sheriff in my area are somewhat like that whereas the state troopers will happily pull someone over that looks suspicious or has out of state plates distractions aside. Perhaps the cops in your area were told to focus on other things. The Sheriff in my area are somewhat like that whereas the state troopers will happily pull someone over that looks suspicious or has out of state plates distractions aside. A few hours ago I saw (on Twitch) some guy live stream his helicopter piloting over a rural picturesque village in Sweden while shouting loud cheers to "chat". Sounds like something that could be easily abused for cracking down on filming police or similar. "obstruction of justice", plus they're obviously doing it "for social media". You don't need to convince them that the penalty is high, you need to convince them that the risk is high. We simply need to take away the driving licence of such people. Your last two sentences point in the correct direction: we can't micro-target every behavior that might possibly become a dangerous distraction, because that's just about everything. Driving safely depends on self-regulation, and people incapable of self-regulating (to a minimum standard) shouldn't be granted the privilege of a license. Mostly the ones I drove were able to tell if I was distracted by checking my instruments or mirrors, or over my shoulder before changing lanes.I came very close to just abandoning the fucking thing in a car park, and getting a train instead. Someone just needs to put that in a car. We've also got lidar based cruise control systems to maintain distance as well as panic brake systems that can react to something in front of the vehicle faster than a human, which is partially there to account for people texting and driving while flying up on a red light with stopped traffic.We have all the tech needed to make it damn near impossible for a 2 ton mass of steal to just unflinchingly mow someone down, yet we live in a world where it's cheaper to not make those things standard, even knowing without it, more people will die than with it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The letter — from OpenAI's chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane and addressed to the White House's director of science and technology policy Michael Kratsios — argued that the government should consider expanding the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC) beyond semiconductor fabrication to cover electrical grid components, AI servers, and AI data centers. OpenAI's letter also called for the government to accelerate the permitting and environmental review process for these projects, and to create a strategic reserve of raw materials — such as copper, alumimum, and processed rare earth minerals — needed to build AI infrastructure. At a Wall Street Journal event on Wednesday, CFO Sarah Friar said the government should “backstop” OpenAI's infrastructure loans, though she later posted on LinkedIn that she misspoke:  “OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for our infrastructure commitments. “We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market,” he wrote, though he said the company had discussed loan guarantees “as part of supporting the buildout of semiconductor fabs in the US.” In the same post, Altman wrote that the company expects to end 2025 “above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate and grow to hundreds of billion by 2030,” and he said OpenAI has made $1.4 trillion in capital commitments for the next eight years.

A serial inventor and entrepreneur, Siminoff joins us on this episode of the GeekWire Podcast to talk about his new book, Ding Dong: How Ring Went from Shark Tank Reject to Everyone's Front Door (out Nov. 10), sharing the messy, high-stakes, and ultimately inspiring story behind the company. Now back at Amazon as a vice president leading Ring and the company's home-security businesses, Siminoff reflects on failure, reinvention, and what comes next in the age of AI. Listen below, subscribe on Apple or Spotify, and keep reading for highlights. What he learned writing the book: The book was almost therapeutic — just going back and looking at this stuff. … My best traits, my most powerful traits, the things that make me successful, are also the worst ones. The importance of having a bigger mission: At Ring, if we had failed, I could still sit here today and say “We tried to make neighborhoods safer.” At least we were successful at trying something. The inventor's mindset: Invention is not just product. … AI understands more like a human, [which] allows you to do things that are just completely different and more efficient.

Sign up for our weekly startup newsletter, and check out the GeekWire funding tracker and VC directory. Yet, as it happens, bootstrapping and building a tech company and producing an independent feature film are surprisingly similar. This was something that surprised me as I pivoted from startup CEO to movie producer. Your skills may be more transferrable than you thought, grit matters a lot, as do equal doses preparedness and luck. Years after co-founding Wellpepper, a digital health startup, I produced This Bloody Country, an independent feature film, and I had expected the two experiences would be completely different. At their core, both start with a unique idea and a small team, naïve and determined enough to believe they can pull it off. The risks are high and many never make it. For This Bloody Country, it was creating a Western from a perspective that hadn't been seen before: a religious family of mostly women and children defending themselves in 1860s Utah Territory. The best early teams have some relevant skills and just enough hubris to believe they can figure out the rest. For Wellpepper, the founding team was CTO Mike Van Snellenberg and me. That outsider perspective became an advantage when we asked naïve questions, challenged assumptions, and moved faster than people who “knew” how things were supposed to work. For This Bloody Country, the founding team was writer/director Craig Packard and me. We had an award-winning script, written by Craig. In both cases, we started by ideating on how to make the idea real — sketching, testing, and adjusting until we found something that resonated. Then we needed to figure out how to get it done with a business plan that was encapsulated in a pitch deck. Next step was to find people who believed in our shared vision and were willing to invest. While Wellpepper was a C-corp, and the movie an LLC, both were designed as investment vehicles with cap tables. In startups, you're promising a future that doesn't exist yet. In film, you're selling a story that hasn't been made. Luck is when preparation meets opportunity, and we had early lucky encounters with both projects. Dr. Ellis, an expert in Parkinson's disease, was studying how care outside the clinic could help slow the progression of the disease and became one of our first research partners. That collaboration resulted in two randomized controlled trial studies (one also in collaboration with Dr. Jonathan Bean from Harvard), and publications in peer-reviewed journals — powerful validation that our product actually improved outcomes. For This Bloody Country, our lawyer's extended family happened to serve on the board of Deer Springs Ranch in Kanab, Utah — which became our primary filming location. The incredible vistas offered million-dollar backdrops to our movie. We also could not have made the film without the help of his extended family: our lawyer's sister-in-law, an expert in period costumes, was our costume designer, and his brother-in-law served as armorer, art department, and even played a bandit. Sometimes good timing and luck show up disguised as coincidence. What matters is being ready to recognize opportunity when it knocks. Many people in both industries told me it couldn't be done. In healthcare, experts warned that startups couldn't navigate the complexity of clinical systems. In film, veterans said making an independent feature wasn't anything like running a startup. Both require solving complex, human problems with limited resources and incomplete information. Approaching each challenge with a beginner's mind — curious, open, and unconstrained by “how it's always been done” — was essential. In both startups and films, you must hire quickly, fire carefully, and align people around the mission. You look for collaborators who can thrive in ambiguity, bring specialized expertise, and check their ego at the door. Whether it's an engineer or a cinematographer, success depends on people who believe in the vision and are willing to do what it takes to get the job done. The ability to translate experience across domains — without assuming they're identical — is what made both ventures work. It's often said that a CEO needs to wear all hats before they hire them, they won't be the best at the role, but will lead better when the role is filled by an expert. You've got to be okay asking for favors and negotiating. There's a saying in startups that if you're not embarrassed by your first product release, you waited too long to ship. The same can be said for getting a rough cut of a film in front of trusted viewers. For both though, you have to be strong in your vision to explore any feedback that indicates that there may be a problem. As Mike Tyson said, “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.” Both paths are defined by risk, and can benefit from, or be challenged by factors outside of your control. Wellpepper was helped by value-based care initiatives which provided tailwinds. The film faced some additional costs due to COVID-related regulations while we were screening. There were essentially only two VC firms in town. We didn't, and that probably made it harder, but it also paved the way for many more digital health startups in town. Similarly, it probably would have been easier to get a movie made in L.A. where the primary industry is showbiz, but we found a small, committed group here (shout out to our executive producers and camera department) and quietly made something outside of the system. What founders and filmmakers can learn from each other We've all heard the overnight success stories: the film that had a bidding war at a big festival, the startup that came out of nowhere and was aquired by a big tech company. The reality is that most people toil for a long time before you hear of them. That film script might have been on the shelf for years. The startup might have pivoted from something you hadn't heard of. Putting an app in the app store or a video on a streaming platform is really only the first step of distribution. While most film is now digital, there are still distributors that facilitate getting the content to all the places it can be streamed (which often have different format requirements or submission guidelines). While there are outlets such as FilmHub that enable self-distribution, rising above the noise often requires help from a third party, just like software. Build a team for the long run. The team will make or break your project, and while we all like to think success will be quick, you may be working with these folks over a long period. Hire people that you would hire again and again whether that's for your next creative project, your next startup, or building a team within a big company if you decide to go that route. Whether pitching investors or distributors, clarity and emotional resonance are your most powerful tools. Start measuring early — whether that's clicks, social media mentions, Kickstarter supporters. Data is a key part of the storytelling that convinces people. Getting more traction than you expected is a solvable problem. Sticking with it is an act of grit. The data back this up: roughly 90% of startups fail, and about 97% of independent films don't recoup their investment. Wellpepper was among that small group of startups that achieved a successful exit when it was acquired in 2020, which gave me the confidence to take on the film challenge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GEO Group, ICE's largest contractor, held an earnings call on Thursday where it discussed the future of its business as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up immigration enforcement in the U.S. The company foresees a rise in the number of people held in detention, as well as more people being monitored through phone apps and ankle bracelets. But the numbers aren't quite as high as they envisioned before Trump came back into office for a second time in January. GEO said it expects to “scale up immigration detention to approximately 100,000 beds or more from the approximately 60,000 beds ICE is currently utilizing,” according to a transcript of the earnings call from Seeking Alpha. SmartLINK, the smartphone app, is currently used by about 147,000 people, while about 30,000 have ankle monitors, according to Bloomberg. The tracking program is run by BI Inc., which started in 1978 making a tracking device for cattle, according to the Washington Post. GEO said it expects to see more reliance on ankle monitors in the future. The Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) is a subprogram within ATD that applies to people who are considered high risk for flight but are still allowed to live in the community rather than being locked up in a detention center. One of the bottlenecks for GEO has been the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who has instituted a policy that any contracts above $100,000 be reviewed and approved by Noem personally. That new policy was blamed for a slow response by FEMA to a deadly flood in Texas back in July. Noem denied it, but the New York Times reported in August that other spending requests weren't getting through as quickly as they should. GEO cited that bottleneck as the first of three reasons that the “pace of new detention contracts has been slower than anticipated.” The second reason was the government shutdown, which has meant that people awarding new contracts are being more cautious. ICE wants to double its employee count from approximately 10,000 to 20,000 people but GEO notes that is “time and staff intensive.” “There's millions of people that are on the non-detained docket,” GEO founder and executive chairman George Zoley said on the earnings call. As Bloomberg notes, GEO has cuts its earnings forecast, which sent the company's stock down 10%. “While the exact timing of government actions, including new contract awards is difficult to estimate, as a management team, we are focused on maintaining a level of readiness to successfully pursue and capture future growth and continuing to allocate capital to enhance value for our shareholders,” said Zoley.

A few Japanese computer stores in Akihabara have started limiting the sales of storage and memory modules due to limited inventory. Another one has even more stringent restrictions, only releasing two storage drives or SO-DIMMs and up to four pieces of memory per buyer, although customers buying a completely new PC can negotiate for a higher limit. Distributors are reportedly suspending deliveries of some products, with no clear outlook for when supply will return to normal. This crunch means that prices for these components are expected to skyrocket, with PC builders and enthusiasts looking for performance parts to be hit the hardest by the shortage and price hikes. It's gotten to the point that memory pricing has already climbed by 100%, meaning you'll have to pay a lot more for the best RAM for gaming. You also won't save money if you opt for older DDR4 tech, as supply for these chips has also started dwindling, as memory makers transition to the newer and more lucrative DDR5 modules. This meant that companies still using this for cheaper product lines are now stockpiling supplies, further increasing your costs if you're looking to replace or upgrade the memory on your older system. Even if manufacturers want to increase production capacity, it takes years to build new factories capable of churning out more memory and storage chips. Because of this, companies might avoid aggressive expansion, as demand could vanish at any time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Startups have never been able to offer the same sizable salaries as big tech companies. If they develop a compensation strategy that is generous, fair, and flexible, they can offer competitive compensation packages and give themselves room to adjust their approach as they grow, according to founders and experts who were onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025. Startups shouldn't try to compete with big tech companies anyway, Yin Wu, the co-founder and CEO of equity management software Pulley, said on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt in October. Startups should instead be as charitable as they can in their compensation packages, Wu said, regardless of their inability to match a big tech company's paycheck. “I think it is unlikely, if the company is really successful, you're going to look back and say, ‘man, I gave away too much equity of everyone that was at my company trying to make this company really successful. “Make sure you're holding them accountable and make sure that you understand what the implications are from a vesting cliff standpoint,” Jakubowitz said, regarding when employees gain control over their equity stakes. Startups should instead ensure their approach is fair from the beginning, so even if they do want to change, they have the proper foundation to do so without setting themselves up for legal trouble or soured office politics. For Wu, and her company Pulley, that meant setting standards around compensation packages. Wu said the company pays a set range for each role — regardless of where a potential employee is based — and consistently builds compensation packages with equity offerings in the 90th percentile. Rebecca Lee Whiting, founder of Epigram Legal and fractional general counsel, added that having these standards will help companies avoid potential legal pitfalls down the line. For instance, it helps companies avoid offering unequal pay across candidates of different genders — which is something all companies should try to avoid ethically — but is also illegal in states like California, Whiting noted. Whiting, Wu and, Jakubowitz all agreed that as long as founders approach building their compensation packages with fair intentions, everything else can be adjusted or changed down the line. “It's not something that you have to get right out of the gate. You will likely have to do clean up post the Series B and acknowledging that is okay. Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

The CVR and FDR are data recording devices mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for installation on all commercial aircraft. These are more popularly known as black boxes, although they are actually painted bright orange to make them easier to find in the debris field of any crash. NTSB investigators open the crash survivable memory unit of the cockpit voice recorder recovered from the UPS MD-11 freighter that crashed Tuesday in Louisville, Kentucky. These devices used magnetic tape when they were first introduced in the 1960s, but were eventually replaced by solid-state memory (SSDs) starting in the 1990s. This made them far more robust, allowing these units to safeguard the recorded data even in the most violent of events. The FDR records up to 25 hours of critical aircraft systems, and could include altitude, airspeed, heading, and over a thousand other parameters. These two devices have helped authorities solve mysteries time and again, allowing them to improve the entire aviation industry across the globe.

Aside from slight errors in sRGB gamma, the Gigabyte Aorus FO27Q5P has no real flaws. Stunning image with deep contrast and saturated color USB ports with KVM and a mic input It is undoubtedly the age of OLED these days, with a new display appearing about as fast as I can review them. It's a 27-inch QHD 2560x1440 Quantum Dot OLED panel with 500 Hz, Adaptive-Sync, DisplayHDR 500 and wide gamut color. The FO27Q5P is absolutely packed with features and performance. Nothing has been left out, and, in a few areas, it outclasses all the competition. Starting with its 500 Hz refresh rate, that is a native figure, no overclocking required. It went right to 500 Hz without a hiccup. It also features a black frame insertion option for reducing motion blur, and includes OLED anti-flicker technology to prevent artifacts during rapid changes in refresh rate. Every possible video processing option is included here. And accuracy comes out of the box with no need for calibration. Panel health is enhanced by passive cooling, which maximizes airflow through a graphene layer and component heatsinks, eliminating the need for fans. You also have extensive options for features like pixel shift, logo detection, and panel refresh. Gigabyte backs the FO27Q5P with a three-year warranty that includes burn-in. Connectivity is also top-notch, with DisplayPort 2.1 support through two inputs, one of which is the mini version, and an output for daisy-chaining multiple screens with a single cable to your PC. You also get DP functions through the USB-C port, and there are two HDMI 2.1 inputs as well. KVM is supported by USB 3.2, one upstream and two downstream ports. The FO27Q5P is a complete gaming hub that lets you connect all your peripherals. A pair of internal speakers operates with 5 watts of power, and there's a backlit Aorus logo that can display different colors and effects. My FO27Q5P arrived in a plain white box, suggesting that it was an early production sample. It's packed in cleverly engineered cardboard rather than crumbly foam, and the entire carton is recyclable. There's a 100mm VESA mount for monitor arms, but no fasteners are included. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The bulge isn't too thick and is nicely accented up top by a backlit Aorus logo whose colors and effects can be controlled from the OSD. This separate panel approach makes cooling easier since air can flow through freely. There's a graphene layer behind the OLED, and no fans are required. The stand is solid and substantial with a slender but wide base made from cast aluminum and finished in a fine crinkle powder coat. Movements are firm with no wobble or play, which befits this premium display. There's an Aorus logo and two small accents underneath the stand attachment point. It doesn't draw too much attention to itself, but still adds a nice touch of visual flair. You also get two HDMI 2.1 inputs, and there's a DisplayPort output, something I rarely see. This means you can daisy chain multiple monitors with a single cable connection to the PC. Full KVM functionality with a setup wizard is included in the OSD. The FO27Q5P's OSD is packed with features for video processing and image adjustment. There are gaming aids, KVM switching, and even quick-change resolution options. It is intended to prevent flicker during rapid changes in refresh rate. I ran several tests and never saw flickering, whether it was on or off. You also get Ultra Clear, which is a black frame insertion feature. It works at speeds below 250 Hz with VRR turned off. Standard lets you change the important things like color temp and gamma. You also get gamut selection though to use sRGB, you must select the sRGB picture mode, which only allows brightness changes. The FO27Q5P has both PIP and PBP capabilities, allowing you to view two video sources simultaneously. It took me a while to find the variable brightness options because Gigabyte hides them confoundingly in the OLED Care menu. And it can only be adjusted for SDR content. In HDR mode, it's locked to its most aggressive level for the brightest possible highlights. Tactical Switch is a resolution toggle for changing screen aspect ratio and sizing on the fly. The default is Eco, and it limits brightness, so I recommend avoiding that one. My SDR settings are below, with APL Stabilize set to Low. If you use Middle or High, you'll likely need a lower brightness value to keep the picture from being too harsh. When an HDR signal is present, the FO27Q5P offers five specific modes, all but one of which are adjustable for brightness and contrast. The FO27Q5P delivers some superb HDR with bright highlights and richly saturated color. Playing Doom Eternal and other similar titles at max detail on a GeForce RTX 4090-equipped PC, I saw framerates between 350 and 450 frames per second (fps). Though there was constant and wide fluctuation, I never needed to employ the anti-flicker setting. That's just as well because it doesn't work in HDR mode. It was obvious, though that this would be an effective tool to maintain high motion resolution at speeds below 200fps. There are no visible artifacts to spoil gameplay. Speaking of, the best HDR mode was Peak 1000. Game and Cinema are very good too, but with a little less impact. Vivid should be avoided as it made the image look garish and cartoonlike. Black frame insertion (Ultra Clear) is something few OLEDs have, so if you have a slower card, it can adapt better than other displays. Color and contrast were superb regardless of other settings as long as I stuck with HDR Peak 1000 or Standard for SDR content. I'm used to the larger DCI-P3 gamut for SDR even though it isn't strictly correct. The FO27Q5P has an sRGB mode which is accurate enough for critical work, but I noted slightly light gamma that could not be corrected. In Standard, there are gamut options but sRGB isn't among them. For other tasks and media, the FO27Q5P is a great desktop tool. The pixel density of a 27-inch QHD screen provides a sharp image with no pixel structure visible at normal viewing distances. It certainly gave nothing away to Ultra HD screens when gaming. Smooth motion and high frame rates are always preferred over sheer pixel density. I noted the FO27Q5P's large list of extras like USB ports, KVM, clear speakers with four audio modes, and its premium build quality and user experience. The speakers play clearly at decent volumes and the modes sound different from one another, with my favorite being Game for its broad and deep sound stage. Online players will appreciate the inclusion of both headphone and microphone jacks. Takeaway: The FO27Q5P is a premium display in every way. It includes absolutely every feature under the sun for gaming, entertainment and productivity. The picture is gorgeous with rich color and contrast only an OLED can deliver. It exudes excellent build quality and solid feel. In the 27-inch QHD OLED category, it's hard to imagine better. Christian Eberle is a Contributing Editor for Tom's Hardware US.

The only smartphone manufacturer with a 10/10 iFixit repairability score is finally bringing its products to the US, but it isn't starting with its phones. Netherlands-based Fairphone announced this week that it will mark its expansion into the US with the Fairbuds XL, its repairable over-ear headphones. It sold more than 100,000 units in 2024, including phones and audio products. The company provides a screwdriver, sells spare parts for years, and offers long-term software support. Its devices may not be the flashiest or the most powerful, but they are a more sustainable solution, also ensuring fair mining practices and wages for workers in its supply chain. Bringing its smartphone over to the US is a little more complicated than headphones, as it requires carrier certifications, but Fairphone tells WIRED it's in “advanced discussions” with select retailers and carriers. Rather than just mirroring your notifications and sending basic replies, now you can read full messages on the Apple Watch, record and send voice messages, see who's calling, send emoji reactions to messages, and see more of the chat history on the screen. You can't take calls on the watch itself or even answer them; you can see who is calling and decline. They share a similar look and aren't too different from the design language Motorola has employed on its 2025 Moto G devices. What's most notable is that the Moto G Play will have 5G support, making it one of the cheapest handsets with 5G at $170. Both phones have 6.7-inch 120-Hz LCD screens, big 5,200-mAh batteries, and IP52 water resistance. Motorola says the Moto G Play will arrive first on November 13 at Motorola, Best Buy, and Amazon for $170, and the $200 Moto G launches on December 11 at Motorola's website first, then at Best Buy and Amazon on January 15. Canon has announced its much-anticipated new EOS R6 Mark III full-frame mirrorless camera. The 3.69-million-dot EVF and 3-inch articulating touchscreen are unchanged, though the R6 III uses Canon's newer, larger battery and adds a CFexpress Type B card slot. The CFexpress Type B helps with some of the impressive photo and video specs, including the ability to capture full-resolution RAW images—with autofocus—at up to 40 frames per second (12 fps if you use a purely mechanical shutter). The R6 III can shoot oversampled 4Kp60, 7K RAW, 7K Open Gate, and Canon Log 2 video. The Canon EOS R6 Mark III will be available later in November for $2,799 (body only). There are a couple of kit options as well, including one with the RF 24-105mm f/4L for $4,049. You can preorder it today at B&H Photo. Fans of dancehall and reggae music (or Jamaican beats in general) will adore Teenage Engineer's latest sample and mic, designed to help you make some extremely island-y jams. The European audio brand is famous for making gorgeous-sounding and beautifully designed musical instruments and recording equipment for the jet-setting class. There are even preloaded samples from folks like King Jammy and Mad Professor, which should get you off to a quick start. II sampler, so folks who know and like that tool will find an easy transition to this one. The EP-2350 Ting microphone comes with built-in effects, like echo, reverb, and pitch shifting.

Strip down to your swim suit, take a controlled breath, and calmly get into the freezing water to see how long you can last. It can also change, depending on what type of exercise you have planned. Immersing your body in ice-cold water may sound like a fun thing to do when you're too hot and on vacation in the Bahamas. But on a rainy workday in midwinter, it fast loses its appeal. When carried out responsibly, the practice of getting into water between 10 to 15 degrees Celsius (50–60 Fahrenheit) for one to five minutes after a workout can be very beneficial for some, however. “While some people try it purely for the invigorating feeling, there is now solid scientific evidence that cold-plunging offers a number of health benefits. Studies have shown that cold immersion can reduce muscle soreness, support recovery post-exercise, stimulate circulation, and boost your mood by triggering the release of endorphins and norepinephrine." While these mind and body health benefits sound enticing, when you cold plunge matters, and it can have an effect on how successfully you train. It's also important to note that cold plunging isn't right for everyone. The beauty of ice bathing is that you don't need to broadcast your plunge on socials to enjoy the process. You don't need an expensive gym membership either. For most, it can be easy to cold plunge from the comfort and privacy of your own home in a number of ways. Online, you can find plenty of dedicated cold plunge pools for use in or around your home and yard. CalmMax, Hydragun and Sun Home Saunas are just a few of the brands that sell easy-to-inflate pop-up cold-plunge pools with prices starting at $50. Another option is to fill your existing indoor bath up with icy cold water. It comes with a selection of timed cold-water shower modes that incrementally lower the temperature of your shower to get you used to the process. It's surely only a matter of time before more bathroom companies follow suit and make it a standard offering in shower design. While it has long been used in sports and physical therapy, there are now dedicated wellness centers that offer “contrast therapy routines,” with breath work, mindfulness, and red light therapy sessions thrown in for good measure. “The rapid change in hot and cold in contrast therapy stresses the cardiovascular system in a positive way and can improve circulation, recovery, and mental resilience,” says Gary Brecka, founder of The Ultimate Human. Going back to hot right after cancels some of that benefit.” So should you cold plunge before or after a workout? While post-cardio plunging can help reduce soreness and support recovery, doing it after lifting or before a workout may actually hinder muscle growth. If you do a strength training workout, Harrison Stevens, a performance specialist at the gym Third Space, suggests waiting six hours before cold-plunging. “If the main goal is muscle growth or tendon rehab post-workout, leaving some time before cold-plunging will allow the exercise-induced inflammation to settle,” he says. “If the workout was endurance-based, then there's no reason not to cold-plunge immediately, as it will improve recovery and your ability to go again tomorrow. After a cardio session, cold-plunging is the number one thing I want to do, as cold exposure also can spike dopamine, and it always feels great after a workout.” Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. There's something invisible that can put us in an early grave. While AI doomers predict the existential risk that artificial intelligence poses to humanity, air pollution—specifically, ultrafine particulate matter, PM 2.5—has been an efficient killer for decades. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution caused 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2019. As Trump's EPA continues to roll back standards and deregulate industries that cause air pollution, the burden of maintaining a safe breathing environment is increasingly falling on individuals. Air pollution's impact on public health and life expectancy isn't novel. In 1970, 22 years after the deadly Donora Smog Event that killed 20 people and sickened over 6,000 in Western Pennsylvania, the Clean Air Act became federal law. Earlier this year, the Trump administration repealed the Biden administration's new standards for air pollutants from taconite iron ore processing, exempting private sectors from complying, saying, “Preserving and enhancing domestic taconite processing capabilities … ensuring [the] resilience of American industrial supply chains.” Taconite iron ore processing creates a major amount of PM 2.5. Trump's White House also repealed recent emissions standards for coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam, along with several other industries. As America's commitment to limiting air pollution declines, there are appliances and actions you can take to keep the air you breathe healthier, both indoors and outside. When people think of high blood pressure, air pollution might not be what they envision. NYU cardiologist Jonathan Newman, an expert on the link between the environment and cardiovascular disease, says that “in broad strokes, air pollution can affect cardiovascular risk factors, blood sugar/diabetes, blood pressure/hypertension.” There, it can build up into plaque on the arterial walls, known as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. According to Newman, “Generally this occurs through direct effects of inflammation, neurohormonal effects, direct particle effects.” The interaction of PM 2.5 causes an imbalance with free radicals and antioxidants that puts stress on the body, causing inflammation and oxidative stress that leads to cell damage. In other words, PM 2.5 can wreak havoc on the molecular level. The World Health Organization recommends that average annual concentrations not exceed 10 micrograms per cubic meter, with daily levels under 20 micrograms per cubic meter. A study found that “over 90 percent of the world population lives at PM 2.5 levels above World Health Organization standards.” The cheapest and easiest protection is to use a well-made N95 face mask. I carry an N95 mask with me at all times, as I cannot predict if a good-air day will turn into a bad-air night. Increased exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution (PM 2.5) is associated with increases in blood glucose and all forms of diabetes.” The findings are not new; in studies going as far back as 1967, researchers have found a link between high levels of PM 2.5 in ambient air (outdoor air) and an increase in diabetes deaths. While respiratory disease has long been studied as a negative outcome of air pollution, recent studies show that it also impacts the nervous system and brain development, linking PM 2.5 with stroke, changes in cognitive function, dementia, and psychiatric disorders. In particular, that fine and ultrafine particulate matter has an outsized impact, as it can be absorbed into the bloodstream to reach the central nervous system. To understand how something tiny like PM 2.5 can cause inflammation, a 2022 study reiterated, “PM 2.5 can pass through the lung-gas-blood barrier and the ‘gut-microbial-brain' axis to cause systemic oxidative stress and inflammation, or directly enter brain tissue via the olfactory nerve.” That PM 2.5 accumulates and results in oxidative stress (the free radicals and antioxidants have an imbalance), where it can “cause systemic inflammation and brain tissue damage.” It isn't just the young that can be harmed by exposure to air pollution; a 2025 study found “long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of neurological disorders such as dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis, and cognitive impairment.” There is, and will continue to be, a divide between those who can reduce the harmful health effects of poor air quality and those who cannot. The use of indoor air purifiers that capture PM 2.5 is essential to well-rounded good health, and knowing how to use an air purifier properly is equally important.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I mean I'd probably say this for any cat story in politics; but this really does seem like a moment where the British media should be making serious attempts at facilitating a national discourse. The stats suggest something is going wrong in the political system that needs to be talked out. This doesn't feel like a good explanation. Don't all newspapers want to increase their readership numbers? "sensationalise their reporting to attract and hold paying readers [so you can buy political influence]" (UK)and"sensationalise their reporting to attract and hold paying readers [so you can make money off subscriptions/ads]" (US)? and"sensationalise their reporting to attract and hold paying readers [so you can make money off subscriptions/ads]" (US)? "sensationalise their reporting to attract and hold paying readers [so you can make money off subscriptions/ads]" (US)? And without advertising, sales and subscriptions have never covered the cost, and advertising has a strong effect on what is published, or more often, what is not. Belloc describes this in his book “The Free Press” [0]. Much easier to stay calm and carry on;)</p>

The company rarely slashes prices this steeply through its own direct channels to protect brand perception, but Amazon has the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 with a 13th Gen Intel Core i5-13420H, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and 512GB PCIe SSD for just $599: That's a massive 76% off the $2,499 list price, which makes this the all-time low price ever seen for this configuration. Meanwhile, Lenovo's site is showing zero Black Friday discounts on comparable models while Amazon is practically giving away this business-class machine at a price that undercuts most budget laptops with far weaker specs. Complementing the processor is 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and it is faster and more efficient than the DDR4 memory found in most laptops at this price. This means smoother performance when you are flipping from one application to another, faster data processing, and better responsiveness in general. The 15.3-inch WUXGA display (1920×1200) offers more vertical screen space than standard Full HD panels which translates to less scrolling when you're working on documents, browsing websites, or reviewing spreadsheets. The IPS panel ensures consistent colors and wide viewing angles so that you are not stuck trying to find the perfect screen tilt to avoid color shifting. For $599, this Lenovo Windows 11 Pro laptop costs less than many inferior laptops that sport older processors, slower DDR4 RAM, smaller storage capacities, and dimmer displays. The 76% discount brings this business-class laptop down to a price point where it actually undercuts generic brands that can't match Lenovo's build quality or performance capabilities.</p>

Dell just dropped one of its most capable laptops down to an absolutely absurd low price for early Black Friday, and honestly, it's hard to believe this deal is real. Dell's own website isn't offering any discount on this model, so Amazon is the only shot at snagging this deal. The 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U isn't your average mid-range processor: It boasts 10 cores split between 2 performance cores-each boosting up to 4.6GHz-and 8 efficiency cores going up to 3.4GHz which means it can handle heavy multitasking without breaking a sweat. That 32GB of DDR4 RAM backs up the processor beautifully and gives you enough headroom for demanding tasks. Mated to the 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD, you get boot times in mere seconds and plenty of room for all your work files. The anti-glare coating and narrow borders of the 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen (1920 x 1080) make this laptop a real pleasure to work on for extended periods. Intel Iris Xe graphics handle everyday visual tasks, from smoothly streaming 4K content to light creative work and casual gaming. The display's narrow border design maximizes screen real estate without bloating the laptop's footprint so you get a spacious viewing area in a package that still fits comfortably in most laptop bags. But Dell sweetens the deal further by bundling an 8-in-1 Type-C hub that adds even more connectivity: an RJ-45 Ethernet port, two additional USB 3.0 ports, SD and Micro SD card slots, another headphone jack, and a 4K HDMI port. Windows 11 Professional comes pre-installed – in S Mode, though you can switch out of it free – giving you access to business features like BitLocker encryption, remote desktop capabilities, and enhanced security tools unavailable on the Home edition. For $749, this Dell Inspiron laptop is less expensive than many budget laptops that carry far inferior specs, slower processors, half the RAM, and smaller storage capacities.</p>
