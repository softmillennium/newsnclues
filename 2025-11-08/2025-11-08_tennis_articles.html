                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the Green Art Wall Project, the Nitto ATP Finals has become inextricably linked to the city of Turin. A mural that promotes sustainability and respect for the environment, it is an artistic creation that, in addition to contributing to urban regeneration, helps to improve air quality. The mural has been created using special Airlite paints capable of purifying the air and concretely contributing to the improvement of the surrounding environment. This work forms part of a broader initiative, the Nitto ATP Finals Torino Green Project, launched in 2023 to promote sustainability and innovation in the city of Turin. The Green Art Wall is an expression of gratitude from the Nitto ATP Finals towards the citizens of Turin: a legacy that the event leaves to the city, marking the culmination of its first five-year presence in Turin. The mural, created by the Turin-based artist MrFijodor and hosted on the wall of the Istituto Comprensivo Leone Senigaglia, tells the story of the connection between sustainability and tennis, a bond founded on shared values such as commitment, growth, and respect. The choice of a school, a symbolic place of learning and the future, represents an additional source of pride for all partners involved. © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It all comes down to Saturday in Riyadh. Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina square off in the singles final, while Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens take on Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani for the doubles crown. It all comes down to this. Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina, both unbeaten and seeking their first WTA Finals title, take center stage as they vie for the Billie Jean King Trophy. In doubles, Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens square off against Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani with the Martina Navratilova Trophy on the line. The respective trophy presentations will be held immediately after each match. Below is a breakdown of the two finals scheduled for Saturday: Note: All matches are local time. Prize money: Because the singles finalists are coming into this match undefeated, the champion will take home $5.23 million, the largest payout in women's sports history. (An undefeated team would have won $1.13 million.) The Case for Kudermetova-Mertens: After knocking out top seeded Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini in their final round robin match, Kudermetova and Mertens took down No. Since falling in their group stage opener, they've won three straight matches. Their one meeting against Babos-Stefani came in the first round of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia. Like Babos, Kudermetova and Mertens are also previous champions of the crown-jewel event. The Case for Babos-Stefani: Since falling in their group stage opener, Babos-Stefani have been on a tear, winning three straight matches. In the semifinals they took down the previously undefeated Hsieh Su-Wei and Jelena Ostapenko, coming back from a break down in each set and needing three match points to secure the victory. Babos-Stefani seek to avenge that defeat in Rome in May, but the loss propelled a title run in Strasbourg the following tournament. They defeated Mertens in Stuttgart, though the Belgian was competing with Chan Hao-ching. For Babos, this would mark the Hungarian's fourth WTA Finals doubles title and first since capturing three straight from 2017-2019. A win on Saturday would secure their fifth title of the season. 1 is just one win away from her first WTA Finals title in her fifth appearance at the event. A perfect 4-0 thus far in Riyadh, she's earned her spot in Saturday's final after a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 semifinal thriller against Anisimova, and returns to the final for the first time since 2022. She also ended Anisimova's 13-match win streak in three-set matches. Standing between Sabalenka and that coveted title is Rybakina, who Sabalenka defeated twice in 2025. Sabalenka, who won the US Open and reached the Australian Open and Roland Garros finals, is the first player to reach the WTA Finals championship and three Grand Slam singles finals in the same season since Angelique Kerber in 2016. She also defeated each of this year's Grand Slam champions at least once in 2025. The Case for Rybakina: The 26-year-old is one win away from a perfect 5-0 campaign in Riyadh and closing 2025 on an 11-match winning streak. This would also be her first WTA Finals title. Pegula certainly tested Rybakina in the semifinals, taking the first set in a two-hour, five-minute thriller. But Rybakina bounced back, and her 15 total aces, five break points and 36 winners helped her overcome 67 unforced errors. Rybakina's final test is the world's best in Sabalenka. Though she trails the head to head, she did defeat Sabalenka in Cincinnati in August. The former Wimbledon champion is seeking her 45th hard-court win of 2025, the most of any player on tour. Win over Alexandrova (playing as an alternate after Keys withdrew) 6-4, 6-4• SF: Win over Pegula 4-6, 6-4, 6-3• Accrued prize money: $2.695 million It all comes down to Saturday in Riyadh. Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina square off in the singles final, while Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens take on Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani for the doubles crown.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Timea Babos reached her fourth WTA Finals title match and Luisa Stefani her first as the duo defeated Hsieh Su-Wei and Jelena Ostapenko in the Riyadh semifinals, coming from a break down to win both sets. Not to be outdone, Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens saved a match point against Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend to reach the final for the first time in three years. In their debut as a team at the WTA Finals, No. 7 seeds Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani will play for the title after coming from a break down in both sets to defeat No. 6 seeds Hsieh Su-Wei and Jelena Ostapenko 6-4, 7-6(5) in the semifinals. The Hungarian is a three-time WTA Finals champion and has now reached her fourth final with a third different partner. She previously won with Andrea Sestini Hlavackova in 2017, and Kristina Mladenovic in 2018 and 2019 -- memories that helped her as she helped deliver another victory here. "I never lost in a semifinal of the WTA Finals before, so I'm just keeping that," Babos said in her on-court interview. In a first-time encounter, Babos and Stefani were the most consistent team throughout. Hsieh and Ostapenko led 3-1 in the first set and 4-2 in the second but were too up-and-down to press home their advantage either time. The Hungarian-Brazilian duo delivered spectacular defense on several key points, holding firm at net to repel both Ostapenko's biggest blows and Hsieh's most creative angles, leaving little space for their opponents to get past. In the ensuing tiebreak, they were also handed a lifeline from 5-2 down by a pair of nervy volley errors by Babos and Stefani. But at 5-5, Ostapenko once again was unable to find a way through, netting a forehand for her team's 43rd unforced error of the day, and Babos sealed her third match point with a service winner. "Really tight in the score, and such a different game style than we've been playing in the past few days," Stefani said afterward. We stayed together -- Timi helped a lot in the first set, I felt I pushed us through the second, and we both helped each other this whole tournament." Three years ago, Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens defeated Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova in a match tiebreak to capture the Martina Navratilova Trophy in Fort Worth. Early Saturday morning, the duo returned to the WTA Finals championship match for the first time since, defeating Siniakova and Taylor Townsend in another match tiebreak, 4-6, 7-6 (6), [10-6] in 1 hour and 52 minutes in Riyadh after saving a match point in the second-set tiebreak. 💥Mertens/Kudermetova defeat Townsend/Siniakova to secure their spot in the final!#WTAFinalsRiyadh pic.twitter.com/Tw3ArYLKFk "It's pretty late," Mertens said after the match. We had to dig really deep against two incredible players. I'm very happy with the super tiebreak that we played. Kudermetova indeed stepped up on several big points, saving match point with a volley in the second-set tiebreak and sealing the comeback with a smash winner. "The girls (Siniakova and Townsend) did an amazing job. They tried some things that were not really comfortable for me. Siniakova and Townsend held match point at 6-5, but Kudermetova's volley kept the title hopes alive. The pairs met once earlier this season, with Kudermetova and Mertens winning in straight sets in Rome en route to the final. On the line Saturday is a second WTA Finals crown for Kudermetova and Mertens. Timea Babos reached her fourth WTA Finals title match and Luisa Stefani her first as the duo defeated Hsieh Su-Wei and Jelena Ostapenko in the Riyadh semifinals, coming from a break down to win both sets. Not to be outdone, Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens saved a match point against Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend to reach the final for the first time in three years.</p>
