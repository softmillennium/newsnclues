                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An analysis of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) indicates that nearly all adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) would have benefits that outweigh the harm from a systolic blood pressure target of <120 mm Hg compared with a target of <140 mm Hg. Thefindings will be presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025 November 5– 9. In a benefit-harm trade-off analysis of 2,012 participants with CKD, investigators found that when predicting individualized treatment effects for multiple outcomesand simulating preferences for participants who view the benefits of intensive blood pressure lowering (reductions in death, cardiovascular events, and cognitive impairment) as much more important than treatment-related harms (such as emergency room visits or hospitalizations for acute kidney injury and fainting), 100% had a positive net benefit favoring intensive blood pressure lowering. When simulating benefits and harms to have similar, intermediate importance, 9 out of 10 still had a positive net benefit. Compared with people with earlier-stage CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate(45–59 ml/min/1.73m2), people with more advanced CKD (20–44 ml/min/1.73m2) experienced more treatment-related harms from a lower systolic blood pressure goal; however, they also had larger benefits, which resulted in the more advanced CKD group having greater net benefits. The findings, which are consistent with KDIGO Guidelines that recommend a systolic blood pressure target of <120 mm Hg for adults with hypertension and CKD, could help patients and care partnersovercome therapeutic inertia that commonly occurs with intensifying blood pressure control in adults with CKD. This study demonstrates that evidence about blood pressure targets from SPRINT can be personalized to adults with hypertension and CKD by using each individual's estimated risks and preferences for multiple outcomes related to bloodpressure lowering, which could help facilitate shared decision-making conversations."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, initially developed to treat type 2 diabetes, have significant heart- and kidney- protective effects. In research conducted in rats, investigators found that dual inhibition of SGLT1 and SGLT2 more effectively reduces salt-sensitive hypertension and kidney injury than SGLT2 inhibition alone. The findings will be presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025 November 5–9. Salt-sensitive hypertension-elevated blood pressure due to excess salt consumption- affects nearly half of individuals with high blood pressure and substantially contributes to kidney disease, cardiovascular complications, and progression to kidney failure. When researchers compared selective SGLT2 inhibition (through treatment with dapagliflozin) with dual SGLT1/2 inhibition(through treatment with sotagliflozin) in a well-established rat model of salt-induced hypertension and chronic kidney disease, they found that both drugs had profound effects on slowing the progression of salt-induced hypertension. Compared with selective SGLT2 inhibition, dual SGLT1/2 inhibition produceda greater reduction in mean arterial pressure and more effectively attenuated kidney injury, although it had no impact on blood pressure under normal-saltconditions. Sotagliflozin also reduced body weight, enhanced urinary sodiumand chloride excretion, and nearly doubled fractional glucose excretion compared with dapagliflozin. SGLT2 inhibition modulated several metabolic pathways in a region-specific manner in the kidney, with pronounced effects on lipid metabolism and inflammatory signaling. Our study provides preclinical evidence supporting the expanded use of dualSGLT1/2 inhibitors beyond heart failure and diabetes, extending their potential into hypertension management, particularly in salt-sensitive patients." "These findings also establish a foundation for further investigation into regional kidney metabolism. Moreover, they highlight lipid and inflammatory pathways as promising therapeutic targets in the treatment of hypertension."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New studies from Arizona State University reveal surprising ways bacteria can move without their flagella - the slender, whip-like propellers that usually drive them forward. Movement lets bacteria form communities, spread to new places or escape from danger. Understanding how they do it can help us develop new tools to fight against infections. In the first study, Navish Wadhwa and colleagues show that salmonella and E. coli can move across moist surfaces even when their flagella are disabled. These currents carry the colony forward, like leaves drifting on a thin stream of water. The researchers call this new form of movement "swashing." It may help explain how harmful microbes successfully colonize medical devices, wounds or food-processing surfaces. Understanding how metabolism drives bacterial movement could help researchers develop new techniques to limit infections, for example by changing local pH or sugar availability. "We were amazed by the ability of these bacteria to migrate across surfaces without functional flagella. In fact, our collaborators originally designed this experiment as a 'negative control,' meaning that we expected (once rendered) flagella-less, the cells to not move," Wadhwa says. "But the bacteria migrated with abandon, as if nothing were amiss, setting us off on a multiyear quest to understand how they were doing it. It just goes to show that even when we think we've got something figured out, there are often surprises waiting just under the surface, or in this case, above it." Wadhwa is a researcher with the Biodesign Center for Mechanisms of Evolution and assistant professor with the Department of Physics at ASU. When bacteria feed on sugars like glucose, maltose or xylose, they sometimes give off acidic by-products such as acetate and formate. Sugar-rich environments in the body, such as mucus, may actually help harmful bacteria spread and cause infection. In contrast, surfactants did not affect swarming, a coordinated, flagella-powered form of movement that lets bacteria spread rapidly across moist surfaces. This suggests the two forms of movement use distinct physical mechanisms, and that surfactants that can be used to selectively suppress (or enhance) the movement of bacteria depending on whether they are swashing or swarming. The fact that bacteria can colonize surfaces even when their normal swimming machinery is impaired has important implications for human health. Some microbes may spread by swashing across medical catheters, implants and hospital equipment. Blocking flagella alone may not be enough to stop them. Knowing they can spread on surfaces through passive fluid flows may help improve how food processing plants design cleaning protocols. Something similar may also occur inside the body, where moist surfaces like gut mucus, wound fluids or the urinary tract create favorable conditions for bacteria. In these places, bacteria could use swashing to spread even when their flagella don't work well. Unlike E. coli, these bacteria don't swim; rather, they navigate environmental and host-associated surfaces using a machine called the type 9 secretion system, or T9SS, which propels a molecular conveyor belt. If a small part of GldJ is deleted, the motor flips its spin from counterclockwise to clockwise, changing how the bacteria move. The study describes this molecular gearset in detail and shows how it allows bacteria to fine-tune their direction of movement, giving them an evolutionary edge in navigating complex environments. Beyond enabling bacterial movement, the T9SS also has major implications for human health - serving both harmful and beneficial roles depending on the microbial community. In the human oral microbiome, T9SS-containing bacteria are linked to gum disease, where their secreted proteins promote inflammation in the mouth and brain, contributing to disorders such as heart disease and Alzheimer's. Conversely, in the gut microbiome, T9SS-secreted proteins can protect antibodies from degradation, thereby strengthening immunity and improving the efficacy of oral vaccines. Understanding how this gearbox works could help scientists design ways to block bacteria from forming slimy bacterial communities known as biofilms, causing infections and contaminating medical devices, but also harness its beneficial properties to promote health and develop targeted microbiome therapies. "We are very excited to have discovered an extraordinary dual-role nanogear system that integrates a feedback mechanism, revealing a controllable biological snowmobile and showing how bacteria precisely tune motility and secretion in dynamic environments," Shrivastava says. Unraveling this intricate design will not only deepen our understanding of microbial evolution but also inspire the development of next-generation bioengineered nanomachines and therapeutic technologies." Shrivastava is a researcher with the Biodesign Center for Fundamental and Applied Microbiomics, the Biodesign Center for Mechanisms of Evolution, and assistant professor with ASU's School of Life Sciences. At first glance, the two discoveries - fluid surfing and molecular gear-shifting, seem worlds apart. But they share a common theme: bacteria have evolved multiple, surprising ways to spread. Many traditional approaches have often focused on targeting flagella. But as these studies show, bacteria can get around that limitation. The research suggests that controlling the bacterial environment, including factors like sugar levels, pH and surface chemistry, may be just as important as targeting bacterial genes. And disrupting key molecular machines like the T9SS gearbox could prevent bacteria not only from moving but also from secreting the proteins that make them dangerous.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The number of adults living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has more than doubled since 1990, reaching nearly 800 million worldwide, according to new research published in The Lancet. The findings come from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2023 study, which tracked CKD trends among adults age 20 years and older across 204 countries and territories from 1990 through 2023. CKD was the ninth-leading cause of death globally in 2023, claiming nearly 1.5 million lives, and the 12th-leading cause of disability. Unlike most other leading causes of death, the global age-standardized mortality rate from CKD increased, from 24.9 per 100,000 in 1990 to 26.5 per 100,000 in 2023. China and India, with some of the world's largest populations, have the highest numbers of people affected by CKD, at 152 million and 138 million. But the disease is widespread, with the United States, Indonesia, Japan, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, and Turkey each reporting more than 10 million adults living with CKD. Reducing deaths is essential to meeting the WHO target of cutting premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one-third before 2030," said Lauryn Stafford, co-author author and researcher at IHME. The study also highlights CKD as a major contributor to cardiovascular disease and points to the risk factors driving its rise. In 2023, kidney dysfunction accounted for almost 12% of global cardiovascular deaths, ranking seventh among risk factors for cardiovascular mortality, ahead of diabetes and obesity. The study identified 14 detailed risk factors for CKD, with diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity driving the greatest loss of healthy years of life. Chronic kidney disease is both a major risk factor for other leading causes of health loss and a significant disease burden in its own right. Yet, it continues to receive far less policy attention than other non-communicable diseases, even as its impact grows fastest in regions already facing the greatest health inequities." The rising prevalence of obesity and diabetes, together with global population aging, is driving a growing burden of the disease. In 2023, the global age-standardized prevalence of CKD was around 14% among adults aged 20 years and older. Countries with the highest prevalence included Iran, Haiti, Panama, Nigeria, Mauritius, Seychelles, Grenada, Mexico, Libya, and Costa Rica. This highlights the importance of screening programs and risk-reducing strategies, including more accessible treatments to control blood sugar and blood pressure. These approaches can reduce excess cardiovascular mortality and delay the need for costly kidney replacement therapies in advanced stages of the disease. Expanding access to diagnosis and affordable care, tackling key risk factors, and investing in strategies that slow disease progression will be essential to lessen the growing toll of CKD on patients, families, and health systems worldwide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists at Oregon State University have filed a patent on a design for a new magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent with the potential to outperform current agents while being less toxic to patients and more environmentally friendly. The new material is based on a structure known as a metal-organic framework or MOF, whose development in the 1990s earned this year's Nobel Prize for chemistry as MOFs' many possible uses become increasingly apparent. MOFs are made up of positively charged metal ions surrounded by organic "linker" molecules. They have nanosized pores and can be designed with a variety of components that determine the MOF's properties. Researchers led by Kyriakos Stylianou of the OSU College of Science say their novel manganese-based MOF, which they named BVR-19, is a promising alternative to currently used contrast agents based on gadolinium. Globally, the MRI contrast agent industry has an estimated value of more than $1.5 billion and is expected to grow by $750 million over the next five years amid rising demand for non-invasive diagnostic procedures. Gadolinium is a rare earth element that comes with concerns regarding toxicity to patients, potential harm to the environment, and supply chain issues given that China accounts for many of the rare earth reserves and much of the processing and production capacity. "BVR-19 represents a paradigm shift in MRI contrast agent design," said Stylianou, who directs the OSU's Materials Discovery Laboratory, or MaD Lab. We're replacing toxic metals with abundant, biocompatible ones, without compromising performance." Gadolinium has been used in contrast agents for nearly 40 years, he said. The body doesn't metabolize the contrast agents, so they pass nearly unchanged into wastewater systems and are resistant to degradation in treatment plants. There is also risk, Stylianou said, from gadolinium retention in the body. Most agents are designed to be excreted within 24 hours of administration, but even in patients with normal kidney function, gadolinium can stay in tissues for months or years. Retention hasn't been conclusively linked to disease, but the Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings and requires patient education because of uncertainty regarding long-term consequences. BVR-19 is the first manganese-based MOF to incorporate L-cystine, a naturally occurring, biocompatible amino acid, Stylianou said. Its synthesis takes place in water at room temperature, no toxic solvents or other harsh conditions are required, and tests show that it allows for brighter, clearer images at lower doses than required of current commercially available agents. "It bridges chemistry, toxicology and medicine, showing how collaboration across disciplines can transform fundamental discoveries into technologies that directly improve human health." Doctoral student Jacob Lessard and undergraduate Dylan Pyle were first authors of the study, which was published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry B.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from University of Jyväskylä have found that personalized interactive music systems – smart technologies that adapt rhythm and tempo to users' movements – can make exercise more enjoyable and help people stay active longer. These systems, known as PIMSs, use real-time data from wearables and smartphones to adjust musical features such as beat, tempo, and style to match the user's pace – whether walking, cycling or lifting weights. For example, when the systems detects you speeding up, it raises the music's tempo to match your energy – helping you stay motivated and in rhythm. This new systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to examine how interactive, adaptive music can influence both exercise performance and emotional experience. Participants who exercised with adaptive music reported more positive feelings and greater motivation during their workouts - in other words, they enjoyed exercising more. The findings also show that faster music tempos were linked with greater benefits, supporting the idea that matching music to movement can help sustain effort and improve performance. Music has always been a motivator for movement. The review analysed results from 18 studies across Europe, Asia, and North America, highlighting the growing potential of adaptive music systems in making physical activity more engaging and sustainable. The study suggests these technologies could play a key role in encouraging people to stay active - an important step in addressing global health challenges linked to physical inactivity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals that contrary toconventional belief, primary glomerular diseases are not necessarily benign for children and young adults. In fact, some subsets of children and young adults may experience faster kidney function decline than older patients. The findings will be presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025 November 5–9. Direct comparisons of outcomes between adult and pediatric patients with primary glomerular diseases are rare-including minimal change disease (MCD), focalsegmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy (MN), and IgA nephropathy (IgAN). MN patients aged 13–17 years and FSGS and IgA nephropathy patients aged 18–44 years at the time of biopsy had thesteepest declines in eGFR among their diagnosis cohorts. For patients with MCD, FSGS, and MN, no differences were detected among various age groups in the risk of progression to the composite outcome of death, kidney failure, or ≥40% eGFR decline, while IgA nephropathy patients aged 6–12 years, 13–17 years, and 45–64 years had lower risks of progression compared with those aged 18–44 years. These findings suggest that young patients who obtained a kidney biopsy diagnosis of primary glomerular disease face significant risk of reaching kidney failure and requiring dialysis and / or a transplant in their lifetimes. We believe that future studies are needed to shed light on the lifetime burden and morbidity of primary glomerular diseases on patients diagnosed at a young age."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new radioimmunotherapy approach has the potential to cure human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, according to new research published in the November issue of The Journal of Nuclear Medicine. The regimen, which pre-treats the tumor before delivering targeted alpha-radioimmunotherapy, resulted in durable major responses--including histologic cures--with minimal toxicities, paving the way for a safer and more effective treatment option for breast cancer patients. Advanced metastatic breast cancer has a poor prognosis, especially for highly aggressive HER2-positive subtypes. Although current HER2-targeted therapies offer improved outcomes, challenges remain because of treatment-related adverse events and tumor resistance to treatment. Previous studies have shown that HER2-targeted radioimmunotherapy with the α-particle-emitting radionuclide 225Ac has been effective, but not safe, as alpha-particles were retained in the body, resulting in high toxicities. In our study, we used a pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) approach to directly treat the tumor and prevent potent alpha-particles from being absorbed in healthy tissues." Sarah Cheal, PhD, assistant professor at Weill Cornell Medicine, New York Researchers began by testing the effects of 225Ac-Pr dosing during PRIT on tumor-targeting efficiency and tissue biodistribution in a BT-474 breast cancer xenograft model. A dose escalation study was also performed on the BT-474 model to establish the nephrotoxic absorbed radiation dose. Treatments were well tolerated, with no chronic radiation toxicity documented. In the patient-derived xenograft model, a single 225Ac-PRIT treatment led to 60 percent complete response and prolonged survival versus no treatment. "This study illustrates the curative potential of 225Ac-PRIT as a treatment for highly aggressive subtypes of HER2-positive breast cancer," said Nai Kong Cheung, MD, PhD, member and attending physician in Pediatric Oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. "If successfully translated to the clinic, HER2-directed 225Ac therapy could offer new treatment options in breast cancer and other HER2-expressing solid tumors."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iain Cheeseman and colleagues reveal the underappreciated role of single genes producing multiple proteins in atypical presentations of rare disease, and present case studies of affected patients through a collaboration with Boston Children's Hospital. Around 25 million Americans have a rare genetic disease, and many of them struggle with not only a lack of effective treatments, but also a lack of good information about their disease. Clinicians may not know what causes a patients' symptoms, know how their disease will progress, or even have a clear diagnosis. Researchers have looked to the human genome for answers, and many disease-causing genetic mutations have been identified, but as many as 70% of patients still lack a clear genetic explanation. In a paper published in Molecular Cell on November 7, Whitehead Institute Member Iain Cheeseman, graduate student Jimmy Ly, and colleagues propose that researchers and clinicians may be able to get more information from patients' genomes by looking at them in a different way. The common wisdom is that each gene codes for one protein. Someone studying whether a patient has a mutation or version of a gene that contributes to their disease will therefore look for mutations that affect the "known" protein product of that gene. However, Cheeseman and others are finding that the majority of genes code for more than one protein. Now, Cheeseman and Ly have shown that mutations affecting one or multiple proteins from the same gene can contribute differently to disease. Then, they examine how mutations that affect these proteins contribute to disease. Through a collaboration with co-author Mark Fleming, the pathologist-in-chief at Boston Children's Hospital, they provide two case studies of patients with atypical presentations of a rare anemia linked to mutations that selectively affect only one of two proteins produced by the gene implicated in the disease. Cells have several ways to make different versions of a protein, but the variation that Cheeseman and Ly study happens during protein production from genetic code. However, some genetic sequences contain more than one start codon, many that are hiding in plain sight. To the contrary, protein production from these alternate starting places is an important feature of cell biology that exists across species. When Ly traced when certain genes evolved to produce multiple proteins, he found that this is a common, robust process that has been preserved throughout evolutionary history for millions of years. Ly shows that one function this serves is to send versions of a protein to different parts of the cell. Many proteins contain zip code-like sequences that tell the cell's machinery where to deliver them so the proteins can do their jobs. Ly found many examples in which longer and shorter versions of the same protein contained different zip codes and ended up in different places within the cell. Because of the mitochondria's role in the essential process of energy production, mutations to mitochondrial genes are often implicated in disease. Ly wondered what would happen when a disease-causing mutation eliminates one version of a protein but leaves the other intact, causing the protein to only reach one of its two intended destinations. He looked through a database containing genetic information from people with rare diseases to see if such cases existed, and found that they did. Through these efforts, Cheeseman and Ly met Fleming. One group of Fleming's patients have a type of anemia called SIFD-Sideroblastic Anemia with B-Cell Immunodeficiency, Periodic Fevers, and Developmental Delay-that is caused by mutations to the TRNT1 gene. TRNT1 is one of the genes Ly had identified as producing a mitochondrial version of its protein and another version that ends up elsewhere: in the nucleus. When Ly shared his results, Fleming revealed that both of those patients had very atypical presentations of SIFD, supporting Ly's hypothesis that mutations affecting different versions of a protein would have different consequences. There are likely other factors contributing to each patient's exact presentation of the disease, but Ly's work begins to unravel the mystery of their atypical symptoms. Cheeseman and Ly want to make more clinicians aware of the prevalence of genes coding for more than one protein, so they know to check for mutations affecting any of the protein versions that could contribute to disease. For example, several TRNT1 mutations that only eliminate the shorter version of the protein are not flagged as disease-causing by current assessment tools. Cheeseman lab researchers including Ly and graduate student Matteo Di Bernardo are now developing a new assessment tool for clinicians, called SwissIsoform, that will identify relevant mutations that affect specific protein versions, including mutations that would otherwise be missed. "Jimmy and Iain's work will globally support genetic disease variant interpretation and help with connecting genetic differences to variation in disease symptoms," Fleming says. "In fact, we have recently identified two other patients with mutations affecting only the mitochondrial versions of two other proteins, who similarly have milder symptoms than patients with mutations that affect both versions." Long term, the researchers hope that their discoveries could aid in understanding the molecular basis of disease and in developing new gene therapies: once researchers understand what has gone wrong within a cell to cause disease, they are better equipped to devise a solution. More immediately, the researchers hope that their work will make a difference by providing better information to clinicians and people with rare diseases. As a basic researcher who doesn't typically interact with patients, there's something very satisfying about knowing that the work you are doing is helping specific people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have unveiled the intricate molecular mechanisms governing TCF/LEF-mediated transcription in the canonical Wnt pathway, identifying these proteins as promising therapeutic targets for cancer and fibrotic diseases. The review, published in Current Molecular Pharmacology, systematically dissects how four mammalian TCF/LEF paralogs-TCF7, LEF1, TCF7L1, and TCF7L2-achieve functional specificity through modular domain architecture and extensive alternative splicing. TCF/LEF proteins function as the final integrators of Wnt signals, converting β-catenin activation into precise transcriptional outputs. Their regulation involves a complex interplay of co-repressors, chromatin remodelers, and post-translational modifications that we've only recently begun to understand in detail." The study reveals that Wnt enhanceosome components remain pre-assembled in a poised configuration even in the absence of signaling, enabling rapid response upon β-catenin nuclear translocation. Key regulatory mechanisms include TLE co-repressor clearance via UBR5-mediated ubiquitination, context-dependent TCF isoform switching, and phosphorylation by kinases such as TNIK and HIPK2. The TNIK inhibitor INS018_055, identified through artificial intelligence-driven drug discovery, successfully completed Phase II trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), demonstrating reduced lung function decline over 52 weeks. "This represents the first robust clinical validation that targeting TCF/LEF regulatory kinases can safely modulate Wnt signaling in humans," Higuchi noted. While challenges remain in developing direct TCF/LEF binders due to their intrinsically disordered β-catenin binding domains, emerging PROTAC and AI-designed protein technologies offer new avenues. The study underscores the potential for selective TCF/LEF modulation to treat diverse diseases while avoiding toxicity associated with upstream Wnt inhibition.
