                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over," he wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday, without providing any details. The post comes one day after Senate Republicans rejected Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's deal that would have allowed the U.S. government to reopen after a shutdown that began Oct. 1. The plan Democrats put forward on Friday proposed protecting federal ACA subsidies for at least one year, in exchange for dropping their demand that a longer-term extension of Obamacare tax credits be included in a stopgap government funding bill. Those subsidies, which more than 20 million Americans use, will expire at the end of December if Congress does not extend them. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday called the Democrats' proposal a "non-starter." The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment or specifics on how Trump's proposed direct payment plan would work. Schumer and Thune did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The D.C. offices for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Congressional lawmakers have been in a stalemate, unable to find a compromise to end the shutdown. Democrats want a funding bill to include health-care subsidies that are due to expire for 24 million Americans at year's end. Republicans, meanwhile, say Congress must first pass a funding bill without strings attached and allow the government to reopen before tackling other issues. In the same post, Trump reiterated his call for terminating the filibuster, the Senate rule requiring 60 of its 100 members to pass most legislation. There are 45 Democratic senators, and two independents who caucus with them. Senate Republicans have pushed back on changing the rule, saying they would not support a change this week as Trump called for his party to exercise what he called "the Nuclear Option" on the rule.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many restaurants may need to rethink their mandatory gratuity policies if they want this income to count as qualified tips for their workers under the new tax laws. The "no tax on tips" provision in President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in "qualified tips" per year from 2025 through 2028. The rub is that mandatory gratuities, the 15% to 20% that restaurants often impose on parties of six people or more, aren't eligible for the deduction, a disappointment to the restaurant and foodservice industry, which held out hope for a different outcome. The service fee issue is sure to resonate with many restaurateurs. Research from the National Restaurant Association shows that 54% of full-service operators — including 67% of fine-dining operators — say their restaurants sometimes add a service charge or automatic gratuity to customer checks. Among this group, 12% add the service charge or automatic gratuity to all checks, while 88% only add it to parties that exceed a specific number of people (typically six or more) or to banquets, private events or catering events. Hagan said during a recent webinar for a large state restaurant association, many proprietors were surprised to learn they weren't supposed to be counting service fees as tips. "They've just always been doing it a certain way — passing on the service fees to employees as a tip," Hagan said. Now, however, restaurants will have to put all tips through payroll, even if they weren't doing it before, or were incorrectly including service fees, so that the employee can benefit from the deduction. There will be more pressure on restaurants to do it properly. "They've got to clean their systems up and follow the law as it's always been," Hagan said. Some advocates for the restaurant industry have been lobbying to change the way service fees are treated. They'd like to see automatic gratuities included as tips. Separately, several members of Congress from Nevada had asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to ensure that automatic gratuities are deemed eligible for the tips deduction. "Functionally, for employees, there is no distinction between auto-gratuity and a tip, and inclusion of this income as eligible will prevent arbitrary distinctions between tip practices that would disadvantage workers based solely on the business model of their employer," lawmakers wrote in an Aug. 12 letter. However, upending the long-standing distinction between service fees and tips doesn't appear likely. "Congressional intent is pretty clear," said Andrew Lautz, director of tax policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center. "What's unclear is how restaurants respond to that," he added. Some restaurants are taking a wait-and-see approach. "Restaurant operators are watching closely for the final 'No Tax on Tips' rules from the IRS and will evaluate any shift in their restaurant's current policies on tipping so that it best suits their tipped employees' desires," Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs for the National Restaurant Association, wrote in an email. "These employees have chosen a restaurant job because of the income potential they get from tipping, so operators want to make sure that they can take full advantage of the tax credit while it is available to them," he wrote. Some restaurants are "consulting with their accountants, point-of-sale providers, and teams to determine what approach works best for their business and employees," said a spokesperson for the Texas Restaurant Association. Some business owners may decide to make changes for competitive reasons. "For restaurants who use the commission-based model or utilize service charges, those servers would likely consider it a disadvantage to forego $25,000 of tax-free income when they could potentially move to a restaurant that does not utilize service charges and are therefore eligible for tax-free tips up to $25,000," said a spokesperson for The Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association. Even though the regulations regarding these rules are not yet final, industry participants aren't expecting much to change with respect to service fees and tip eligibility. That's not likely to change in the final regulations, he said. "If a customer is expressly provided an option to disregard or modify amounts added to a bill, such amounts are not mandatory amounts," the guidance states. Say, for example, that a restaurant's menu states that an automatic 18% charge will be added to all bills for parties of six or more customers. Another option would be for the restaurant to include a "recommended tip" equal to 18% of the price for food and beverages, and include a line for the customer to subtract (including to zero) or add to the recommended tip amount before paying the bill. In another example provided by the IRS, a server presents a customer's bill on an electronic handheld point-of-sale device, which offers the option to pay 15%, 18%, 20%, other, or no tip. As restaurant owners and employees weigh their options, the clock is ticking. Because President Trump's OBBBA is so new, and the IRS is still crafting the applicable regulations, the situation is complicated for restaurants and other businesses whose employees want to claim a deduction for 2025. This means employers will not face penalties for "failing to provide a separate accounting of any amounts reasonably designated as cash tips or the occupation of the person receiving such tips." This safe harbor only applies to tax year 2025. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For millions of Americans, it is an uncertain time. Amazon, General Motors and Paramount have all been making layoffs, and U.S.-based employers announced 153,074 job cuts in October altogether, according to research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. There are ways to cope that don't exacerbate the financial anxiety you might be feeling. For example, financial therapist Aja Evans recommends leaning into self-care activities that cost little to no money, like going outside and spending time with family and friends. But there's a mindset shift people can make as well. Instead of experiencing uncertainty as an anomaly, remember that "uncertainty is fundamental reality," says best-selling author and wellness guru Deepak Chopra. "Every moment we breathe, live and move in uncertainty, pretending that it's certainty." The 79-year-old recently launched a wellness platform offering various meditations, live digital sessions with him and a Deepak Chopra AI chatbot drawing from his decades of writing and talks that users can interact with directly. "In every uncertain event," says Chopra, "there is the seed for a greater opportunity and creativity." That creativity can lead to fresh problem solving in whatever difficult circumstance you're facing and solutions you haven't considered before. When you feel that anxiety creeping in about an unclear future, "start with the presumption that life is uncertain," says Chopra.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neurodiverse professionals may see unique benefits from artificial intelligence tools and agents, research suggests. With AI agent creation booming in 2025, people with conditions like ADHD, autism, dyslexia and more report a more level playing field in the workplace thanks to generative AI. A recent study from the UK's Department for Business and Trade found that neurodiverse workers were 25% more satisfied with AI assistants and were more likely to recommend the tool than neurotypical respondents. "Standing up and walking around during a meeting means that I'm not taking notes, but now AI can come in and synthesize the entire meeting into a transcript and pick out the top-level themes," said Tara DeZao, senior director of product marketing at enterprise low-code platform provider Pega. DeZao, who was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, has combination-type ADHD, which includes both inattentive symptoms (time management and executive function issues) and hyperactive symptoms (increased movement). AI tools in the workplace run the gamut and can have hyper-specific use cases, but solutions like note takers, schedule assistants and in-house communication support are common. Because of the skills that neurodiverse individuals can bring to the workplace — hyperfocus, creativity, empathy and niche expertise, just to name a few — some research suggests that organizations prioritizing inclusivity in this space generate nearly one-fifth higher revenue. "Investing in ethical guardrails, like those that protect and aid neurodivergent workers, is not just the right thing to do," said Kristi Boyd, an AI specialist with the SAS data ethics practice. "It's a smart way to make good on your organization's AI investments." Boyd referred to an SAS study which found that companies investing the most in AI governance and guardrails were 1.6 times more likely to see at least double ROI on their AI investments. But Boyd highlighted three risks that companies should be aware of when implementing AI tools with neurodiverse and other individuals in mind: competing needs, unconscious bias and inappropriate disclosure. For example, while people with dyslexia may benefit from document readers, people with bipolar disorder or other mental health neurodivergences may benefit from AI-supported scheduling to make the most of productive periods. "By acknowledging these tensions upfront, organizations can create layered accommodations or offer choice-based frameworks that balance competing needs while promoting equity and inclusion," she explained. Regarding AI's unconscious biases, algorithms can (and have been) unintentionally taught to associate neurodivergence with danger, disease or negativity, as outlined in Duke University research. The work to make AI deployment more equitable, including for neurodivergent people, is just getting started. The nonprofit Humane Intelligence, which focuses on deploying AI for social good, released in early October its Bias Bounty Challenge, where participants can identify biases with the goal of building "more inclusive communication platforms — especially for users with cognitive differences, sensory sensitivities or alternative communication styles." For example, emotion AI (when AI identifies human emotions) can help people with difficulty identifying emotions make sense of their meeting partners on video conferencing platforms like Zoom. Still, this technology requires careful attention to bias by ensuring AI agents recognize diverse communication patterns fairly and accurately, rather than embedding harmful assumptions. With my form of ADHD, it's almost impossible to multitask," she said. DeZao says one of AI's most helpful features is its ability to receive instructions and do its work while the human employee can remain focused on the task at hand. "If I'm working on something and then a new request comes in over Slack or Teams, it just completely knocks me off my thought process," she said. "Being able to take that request and then outsource it real quick and have it worked on while I continue to work [on my original task] has been a godsend."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Bank and Bank of America cards are currently not available on CNBC Select and links have been redirected to our credit card marketplace where you can review offers from other issuers like American Express or Chase. You can also check out our list of best credit cards for alternative options. The American Express Platinum Card® is packed with a seemingly endless list of perks in exchange for an $895 annual fee (see rates and fees) — but not everyone wants to pay such a princely sum for the entire slate of benefits — and you don't have to. We looked at a few of the best perks of the Amex Platinum Card and figured out how to closely replicate them cheaply. We prioritized cards in this order: those without an annual fee, those with an annual fee under $100 and a couple that have an annual fee that's waived the first year. Of course, the Amex Platinum has a few benefits that can't be duplicated, like Centurion Lounge access, but you can get a card or two that offer similar benefits with a much lower price tag. If approved, you will: (1) receive your Welcome Offer details, (2) have the option to accept the Card with that offer, (3) be required to spend $8,000 on eligible purchases within the first 6 months of Card Membership, and (4) earn Membership Rewards® points. Welcome offers vary and you may not be eligible for an offer. The American Express Platinum Card® is a premium card loaded with annual statement credits, entertainment benefits, extensive airport lounge access, elite status perks and more.

Personal and small business credit cards issued by U.S. Bank are currently not available on CNBC Select but you can check out our marketplace to compare offers from other issuers including American Express and Chase. The U.S. Bank Altitude® Connect Visa Signature® Card has no annual fee and you get four Priority Pass lounge visits per year. These visits also get you access to Priority Pass partner restaurants and non-lounge experiences (like nap rooms and gaming centers) that even the Amex Platinum doesn't cover. While this is a far cry from the unlimited airport lounge access you get with the Amex Platinum, it might be enough to cover all, or most, of your airport lounge needs. Use the card five times each statement period to earn points. Up to 5% for each balance transfer, with a minimum of $5. Did you know Amex Platinum's rental car coverage* is actually secondary? A big benefit of the premium rental car protection is that you're covered for up to 42 consecutive days (up to 30 days for Washington State residents), whereas other plans typically end after 31 consecutive days. That won't matter if your trips are usually less than a month, but it's worth pointing out. To get primary rental car insurance without an $895 annual fee or additional fee for every rental, get the Bilt Mastercard®. Its primary rental car insurance covers up to $50,000 in damage or theft (except for New York residents renting within the United States, then it's secondary). *Car Rental Loss and Damage Insurance can provide coverage up to $75,000 for theft of or damage to most rental vehicles when you use your eligible Card to reserve and pay for the entire eligible vehicle rental and decline the collision damage waiver or similar option offered by the Commercial Car Rental Company. Car Rental Loss or Damage Coverage is offered through American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. The Fidelity® Rewards Visa Signature® Credit Card earns unlimited 2% cash back (when deposited into an eligible Fidelity account) and has no annual fee or foreign transaction fees. You'll also get up to $100 in rewards when you pay for your Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee with your card. While that won't cover the full $120 Global Entry fee, it's still a generous benefit for a card that costs nothing to keep long-term and will cover your entire TSA PreCheck fee. You can also deposit your rewards directly into a Fidelity account, which is an easy way to save for your future. The Wells Fargo Autograph® Card offers generous bonus spending categories and lets you transfer points to airline and hotel partners, which is rare for a credit card with no annual fee. 3% intro for 120 days from account opening, then up to 5%, min: $5 That covers a big portion of most budgets, but, admittedly, Wells Fargo's transfer partners are lacking compared to Amex Membership Rewards®. Still, if you like a couple of them, including Choice Privileges, Flying Blue and Virgin Atlantic Flying Club, you can do very well with this card.

The Amex Platinum Card allows you to choose an eligible airline and receive up to $200 back per calendar year to cover incidental charges with that airline, such as upgrade fees, in-flight snacks or checked bags (enrollment required). With the Bank of America® Premium Rewards® Credit Card, you get up to $100 back per year — which is more than the card's annual fee — for airline incidentals, would could be seat upgrades, checked bags, in-flight purchases or anything else that pops up. Best of all, it's not tied to any airline, so you can mix and match until you use the entire credit. Alas, there are a few benefits that the Amex Platinum does so well, they're veritably impossible to duplicate with a low-cost card, including: Money matters — so make the most of it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Business: Monro, formerly Monro Muffler Brake, is engaged in the provision of automotive undercar repair and tire services in the United States. It also offers tires and routine maintenance services, which include state inspections. It also offers scheduled maintenance services in its stores where services are packaged and offered to consumers based upon the year, make, model and mileage of each specific vehicle. Icahn has invested across all sectors over his more than six-decade long career and has a long history in the automotive parts and services industry. He has been involved in several mergers and acquisitions in this space, acquiring some of his portfolio companies through Icahn Automotive, the automotive-segment business of his conglomerate, Icahn Enterprises. Monro is engaged in the provision of automotive undercar repair and tire services in the United States, operating more than 1,100 repair shops and tire dealers in 32 states under multiple regional brands. The company has faced several challenges in recent years. Macro factors like lower consumer demand, higher material and labor costs, and a trend in consumer trade-down to lower margin tire products have applied significant margin and growth pressure. Most recently, the company's third-quarter earnings report left a lot of investors disappointed about its strategic transition, with weaker-than-expected revenue and no specific financial guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. Lastly, many investors have questioned the company's dividend payout ratio, which has remained relatively large despite these ongoing struggles. Putting all this together, it comes as little surprise that shares have underperformed, down 44.73%, 66.73% and 63.25% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively, prior to Icahn's announcement. Perhaps this depressed valuation is what caught the eye of Carl Icahn. While there are plenty of cheap stocks, this isn't Icahn taking a flyer on the automotive industry. Icahn knows this industry well and likely sees Monro as a great business that is significantly undervalued. The timing of this public engagement is also very notable. It is not just the stock's recent fall that makes this a good entry point for an investor like Icahn. Monro recently agreed to collapse its dual class share structure, which had previously granted its sole Class C shareholder, Peter Solomon, veto power over any matter brought to a shareholder vote, effectively making this a controlled company. So, what does this mean for the company's shareholders? With one person having veto power over all material board decisions, the rest of the board becomes somewhat irrelevant. With this conversion, the company has an opportunity to have a real, collaborative, and productive board. This would require its reconstitution, and we know of nobody better or more experienced than Icahn for that endeavor. Solomon is an 87-year-old renowned investment banker and Icahn is, well, Icahn and a contemporary of Solomon. However, there is no evidence that the two have ever crossed paths. Despite this, we would imagine that they have many relationships in common and mutual respect for each other. While there are many different ways this campaign can go down, what we would like to see is the two elder statesmen meeting in a room with an air of civility and cordiality uncommon in the average activist engagement and together coming up with a board that will oversee management, hold them accountable on behalf of shareholders and usher the company through its first real phase as a truly public company. With Solomon already agreeing to give up control, and neither Solomon nor Icahn likely to be on the continuing board, there is no reason why this should get contentious. Icahn has built his automotive industry on acquisitions, and Monro appears to fit in very nicely in IEP's automotive business. Icahn has launched activist campaigns at some of the auto companies that he later went on to acquire, including Pep Boys-Manny Moe and Jack in 2016 and Federal Mogul in 2017. When Icahn acquired Pep Boys he also stated: "We believe that with our abundant resources and knowledge of the industry we will be able to grow this business and take advantage of consolidation opportunities, thereby benefiting customers, manufacturing partners and employees, as well as our shareholders." While we sincerely believe that Icahn's main motivation for this investment is to invest in a good company that he believes is at an inflection point and is significantly undervalued, there is always the chance that he might want to own the entire company one day. This is a very small position for him and a good return would not move the needle as much as a synergistic integration into his automative business, but we see no reason why both things cannot be true.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.) Berkshire Hathaway's B shares and A shares moved 4.5% higher this week after a strong earnings report last weekend, even as the broader market moved lower amid fears AI stocks are overvalued and worries about weakness for the U.S. economy. The Nasdaq's 3% drop was its worst weekly decline since April. The upturn for Berkshire shares has cut its underperformance versus the benchmark S&P 500 to 4.3 percentage points from 12.2 percentage points on October 29. Operating profits for Berkshire's wholly owned companies were up 34% to almost $13.5 billion in the third quarter, with a 200% increase for insurance underwriting income. There were again no stock buybacks, a sign Buffett does not think Berkshire shares are significantly undervalued despite their weakness since May. With no money spent on buying back Berkshire shares and equity sales outpacing purchases, the company's September 30 cash hit $381.7 billion, up 10.9% since the end of June. If you subtract BNSF's cash and account for the timing of some Treasury bill purchases, the total is $354.3 billion, up 4.3% from June. Warren Buffett may be delivering his final message as Berkshire's CEO next Monday. This week the company confirmed in a news release what it told the Wall Street Journal last week. "On Monday, November 10th, Berkshire will be issuing a press release which will contain a message from Mr. Buffett regarding philanthropy, Berkshire and other matters that Berkshire shareholders and others may find to be of interest." While he will remain chairman of the board, he will not be on stage at next May's meeting and new CEO Greg Abel will be writing the annual letter to shareholders. We won't know for sure until next Friday's release of Berkshire's Q3 equity portfolio snapshot, but it looks like there were more sales of Apple shares during the three months ending September 30. CNBC.com's Yun Li notes Berkshire's 10-Q last Saturday reported a $1.2 billion decline in its cost basis for consumer product stocks, which would include Apple. She also points out that Apple's 24% gain during the quarter would have provided an opportunity for Buffett to lock in more profits. Apple remains Berkshire's largest equity holding, currently valued at $75.2 billion, but it has cut the position by 69% over the past two years. Barron's divides that $1.2 billion cost basis drop by $35, Apple's per-share basis, to estimate Berkshire may have sold 35 million shares for around $8 billion, based on Apple's average price of $230 per share during the quarter. With Apple reporting in its 10-Q that it had $12.4 billion in Q3 equity sales, Barron's suggests a lot of the remaining $4.4 billion may be Bank of America sales, another big position that Berkshire has been sharply reducing. That stake has been cut by around 40% since the beginning of last year. At $32.2 billion, it is Berkshire's third largest equity holding. All five of the stocks are at or near all-time highs. The figure could be even higher assuming some of Berkshire's continued buying has not yet been publicly revealed. Berkshire Hathaway has a new warning about YouTube videos with "images or AI created images impersonating" Warren Buffett. A news release Thursday said, "Generally, such video images of Mr. Buffett may appear to look like him but the sound of the impersonator speaking in a very flat monotone voice is clearly not the voice of Mr. It added, "Mr. Buffett is concerned that these types of fraudulent videos are becoming a spreading virus. Individuals who are less familiar with Mr. Buffett may believe these videos are real and be misled by the contents of these videos." In April, a Berkshire release cited unspecified "reports currently circulating on social media" about "comments allegedly made" by Buffett and said, "All such reports are false." Buffett also warned shareholders at the 2024 Berkshire annual meeting that AI's ability to create fake audio and video could make scamming "the growth industry of all time." Warren Buffett explains why investors should look at their stocks the same way they would look at owning a farm or an apartment. You know, people really -- if they didn't look at quotations -- but of course, the whole world is urging them to look at quotations, and more than that, do something based on small changes in quotations. But think how much more rational -- we've talked about it before -- but think how much more rational investing in a farm is than the way many people buy stocks. No, you look at the apartment house or the farm, and you say, "I expect it to produce so many bushels of soybeans and corn, and if it does that, it meets my expectations." But if you can't get yourself in that mental attitude, you're going to be scared whenever everybody else is scared. I could get this fellow's courage up substantially by saying this is a wonderful time to buy, and then a week from now he'd run into somebody else that tells him the world is coming to an end and he'd sell.

Beaches, balmy weather, bustling nightlife, and, of course, attractive savings on capital gains taxes. The day traders of San Juan seem to have it all. That, at least, is the story that has circulated among young investors, as the number of traders who have relocated to Puerto Rico has surged in recent years. They're drawn by the tax advantages, and the fact that, if you squint, it really just looks like you're on permanent vacation. But, for traders who have joined the exodus, being happy in Puerto Rico is tougher than it seems at first glance. Many who make the move often say that life isn't quite what they expected, even though they are, after all, saving a lot of money. Anand Sanghvi, a trader who moved to Puerto Rico around 2018 and now "onboards" others relocating to the island with the help of a sprawling network of lawyers and realtors, says the move has never been more popular. Numbers have nearly tripled over the last two years since Sanghvi first came to the island himself, he told Business Insider. Andrew Gordon, the managing attorney at Gordon Law Group, says he counsels "hundreds" of traders each year about whether they should move to Puerto Rico. Traders who seek their help — many of whom are young men, Gordon says — are often sitting on a mountain of capital gains, which they know will eventually draw a hefty tax bill. The sun and party scene in San Juan, Puerto Rico's capital, are cherries on top. Luke Lintz, a 26-year-old crypto trader who moved to Puerto Rico during the pandemic, said he was sold on the idea when he was preparing taxes for his business in 2020. Lintz jumped on a call with his accounting team to figure out how they could best mitigate the tax hit, and then packed his bags to Puerto Rico a week later. Lintz, who moved to Puerto Rico with his brothers, says he loves the island. His town, Palmas Del Mar, is "mellow" and allows him to put his head down and focus on business. "It's being on a permanent vacation," he said. "We're doing a ton of things and a lot of activity, and then being able to come back to a place where really all I want to do is just take good care of my body, get a lot of sunlight, and then work — it's great because there's very little distractions." Steven Dux, a 31-year-old trader, moved from California to Puerto Rico this spring. It feels like a movie, Dux says, though he's aware that the town is different from most of the island. Of course, there's benefits and there's some sacrifice," he said, adding that the biggest pro was the ability to save tons of money. There seems to be one big catch to life in Puerto Rico: assimilating is harder for some than others. Sanghvi and Gordon estimate that around half of the traders they know who move to Puerto Rico and find themselves unhappy — or, at least, surprised by what it's like once they arrive. "There are people unfortunately who come down here and who expect everything to be on the level that it was in the States, and you don't realize this is a whole different world," Sanghvi said. "They continue to kind of bang themselves on their head about this. Many traders find it hard to adjust their expectations when it comes to the conveniences they take for granted in the US. There's no such thing as one-day delivery in Puerto Rico, for instance. For traders, this means having a backup generator is critical, Gordon said. Puerto Rico's social scene, though, seems to be the biggest issue. It can be hard for a newcomer to meet people, Sanghvi says, depending on whether they already have contacts and how much they're willing to put themselves out there. Dux said life in his neighborhood could be "very boring" at times, due to the community being small and having little to do. Lintz said he felt Puerto Rico was cliquish. There are a handful of prominent social networks across the island, he said, with some being more insular than others. "It's just hard to get to know people because I just don't think there's that many events and opportunities to meet people in person," he said, adding that he and his brothers planned to be more focused on work for the next several years. Tension between locals and newcomers adds another challenge. The streets of San Juan are filled with graffiti telling recent transplants to go home, Lintz said. They don't feel welcome," he said of those traders. Many traders who move with their families find that their wives are bored, Sanghvi said, adding that it was common for married couples to move back to the States. To Sangvhi, who says he runs into connections everywhere he goes in Puerto Rico, the key to being happy on the island isn't so much a secret as it is a personality and a willingness to step outside one's comfort zone. His advice is straightforward: Learn Spanish, network, and explore the island beyond San Juan. "Most people who come here, they just sit inside their bubble, and that's it," Sanghvi said. "If you're not a person who is willing to step out of said comfort zone, it's going to be hard for you." Sanghvi said some traders treat their time on the island like they're in prison.</p>

"It would be helpful for young people to think more about what tasks they're actually really good at, because that's where they stay ahead of machines," Mollick told Business Insider. Every job, he said, requires many tasks, and it's unlikely that a single applicant will excel at all of them. Knowing how to provide clear instructions is crucial for maximizing the benefits of AI as it completes tasks. He also advised that young people should focus on gaining broad knowledge and developing expertise in specific topics. AI is threatening entry-level jobs across industries, making it especially hard for Gen Zers to find work. Mollick — who has consulted with JPMorgan, Google, and the White House on AI usage — told Business Insider that he's most concerned about whether we're tackling the question of how to restructure jobs with enough urgency. As AI automates some technical abilities, soft skills are newly crucial for job applicants. Communication, leadership, and organizational prowess were among the top skills identified by Indeed's Hiring Lab.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For some diehard Starbucks fans, a $7 latte isn't enough of a splurge — they're ready to spend hundreds of dollars on the collectible holiday cup it comes in. Starbucks' Glass Bearista Cold Cup, which launched and quickly sold out on Thursday at an original price point of $29.95, has evolved from festive holiday merch into an investment item, fueling a resale market usually reserved for designer sneakers and rare toys. While it doesn't appear that any have sold for such an exorbitant price, auction listings reviewed by Business Insider have racked up bids upward of $285 (plus shipping). "Despite shipping more Bearista cups to coffeehouses than almost any other merchandise item this holiday season, the Bearista cup and some other items sold out fast," the spokesperson said. The holiday spirit at Starbucks came with an extra side of scarcity this year, as some baristas who worked on launch day said their stores received just one or two Bearista cups to sell — and customers were lined up before opening, ready to claim one for themselves. A shift supervisor who has been with the company for over a year told Business Insider that customers lined up outside for more than half an hour before the store opened, and since they only received two Bearista cups to sell, they "sold out immediately." "I got to my store somewhere between 3:45 and 3:50 a.m. and there were already several people literally wrapped in blankets, camped out in front of the store," a Minnesota-based barista who has worked with Starbucks for seven years told Business Insider. "When we tried to enter, after reminding them that the store does not open until 4:30 a.m., they tried to push their way in with us." The 2025 Bearista cup isn't Starbucks' first foray into collectible merch. The company first debuted its Bearista in 1997 in plush form and has since expanded into a wide variety of seasonal and themed merchandise, which customers regularly clamor for. A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider that the policy for merchandise sales requires the items to be sold on a first-come, first-served basis, with no purchase limit or holds — meaning customers could buy more than one, and a staff member could not set aside an item with the intent to purchase it themselves, or save it for a customer. John Kauchick, a 70-year-old Starbucks fan in Mississippi who says he has spent "several thousand" dollars on collectible merchandise from the coffee giant over the last 25 years, told Business Insider he camped outside his local Starbucks starting at 3 a.m. to get a chance at purchasing the bear, as well as some limited-edition Hello Kitty-themed merchandise also released on Thursday. Although he was first in line, Kauchick said a barista at the location he visited had purchased the store's lone Bearista cup for herself before he had the opportunity to do so, which has irritated him enough to consider stopping his spending at Starbucks entirely. "I felt cheated out of the opportunity to get one," Kauchick said. The fervor is reminiscent of the craze surrounding cult items like Labubu dolls, which Business Insider reported in August were on track to hit a billion dollars in sales this year, and created a secondary market of people creating custom versions, including tattooed Labubus that sell for over $200 each, for the most committed fans of the brand. For every post bragging about scoring one of the coveted cups, there's another from an exhausted barista, publicly begging customers to understand that they have no personal control over the available inventory. Once the Bearista cups were sold out at her store, the Minnesota-based barista said some customers became aggressive, calling her and other staff "flat out disgusting" names. Another barista, who has worked at the company for 11 years, told Business Insider that "the phone wouldn't stop ringing" all day Thursday, with customers calling to see if their store happened to have an extra Bearista on hand. "If customers were polite, I would apologize and direct them to the Target store where they might have a slim chance to get one," they said, referencing licensed in-store cafés, which were rumored to have received more Bearista inventory than corporate-owned stores. Although some social media reports suggested that a handful of Starbucks fans became violent over the Bearista launch, Business Insider could not verify any such incidents. Still, it wouldn't be the first time collectors threw punches over a popular item. "I'm a bug for rarity, and one thing that Starbucks does is they build up the expectation or the perception of scarcity — and they do that on purpose," Kauchick said.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Manhattan federal judge on Friday declared a mistrial in the case of two MIT-trained brothers accused of fraud for a 12-second transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that netted them $25 million. The judge ended the trial of James and Anton Peraire-Bueno at 7 p.m. after the jury's five men and seven women pleaded in a lengthy note for deliberations to end, saying the case had become an emotional strain and they could not reach a unanimous verdict. The verdict is the third failure this year for federal efforts to convict defendants in multimillion-dollar digital asset fraud and money laundering cases. Prosecutors did not immediately say if they will seek to retry the two brothers. "We all did our best," a male juror told Business Insider, declining to comment further before leaving the courthouse. "Finding the appropriate standard was a struggle for us." James Peraire-Bueno, 29, and Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, faced three charges — wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and money laundering, each carrying a maximum of 20 years in prison. To find them guilty of wire fraud, jurors needed to agree that the brothers intentionally made at least one fraudulent misrepresentation to deceive others for the purpose of obtaining money. Throughout deliberations, jurors repeatedly asked for clarifications and definitions around such key words as "wrongful," "willful," "misrepresentation," and "false pretense." Federal prosecutors described the brothers' 12-second, April 2023 maneuver as a "first of its kind" blockchain heist, but emphasized to the jury that the high-tech money grab was no different from any simpler or less modern fraud. "There is no separate law about fraud on the blockchain," Assistant US Attorney Danielle Marie Kudla told jurors Tuesday, during closing arguments. Whether on the phone, online, or on Ethereum, "You can't tell a lie and deceive people to get their money," she added. Prosecutors said the brothers' fraudulent misrepresentations included their typing a series of invalid zeros, which voided or "poisoned" a block of transactions they were supposed to blindly add to the blockchain. "They took on risk and enjoyed tremendous success," Marx told jurors. "They should be celebrated, not villainized by the prosecution." Both sides agreed the Peraire-Bueno's was a first-of-its kind prosecution. Until now, the blockchain has been self-regulating, defense lawyers argued last year, calling the Peraire-Bueno prosecution unwelcome and unneeded. Prior to this latest outcome, the DOJ suffered two other major losses in federal courts in Manhattan this year. In May, a federal judge overturned the jury's wire fraud conviction against Avraham "Avi" Eisenberg, who was accused of draining $110 million through a pump-and-dump scheme. In August, another Manhattan jury could not agree if Tornado Cash CEO Roman Storm laundered $1 billion in dirty crypto. One notable pre-trial victory came last month, when federal prosecutors in Brooklyn announced the largest forfeiture in department history, seizing $15 billion in bitcoin from the accused mastermind behind an international cryptocurrency investment fraud ring.</p>
