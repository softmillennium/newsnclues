                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Bitcoin and Ethereum funds shed assets, Bitwise's fledgling Solana ETF racked up more than $126 million in net inflows in its first full week of trading, an auspicious sign for the SOL-tracking product and potentially for other altcoin funds. The Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) has generated more than $545 million in net inflows since its October 28 debut on the New York Stock Exchange, including $223 million in seed investments, according to UK asset manager Farside Investments. "Inflows every day for the last 8 days since its launch," crypto asset manager Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsely wrote in an X post early Friday. Over that period, the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs have lost more than $2.1 billion in assets, while net outflows for the nine Ethereum funds have totaled $579 million. The Bitwise Solana fund's promising start comes even as SOL's price has been dropping, part of a market-wide downturn tied to a government shutdown and other macroeconomic uncertainties. Solana was recently trading at $156, off more than 16% for the past week and nearly 29% over the last month, according to crypto markets data provider CoinGecko. Bitcoin has declined about 16% since early October when it rose to a record high above $126,000. In a text to Decrypt, etf.com Senior Analyst Sumit Roy wrote "the (Solana) inflows make sense," noting the token's massive $90 billion market value: "Solana has a devoted following, arguably the most devoted following after Bitcoin and Ethereum." He added: "It wouldn't be surprising to see Solana ETFs collectively account for 5% of that market cap at the very least. The fact that BSOL launched with 100% staking certainly made it more attractive as well." The listing of the Bitwise fund and a Grayscale Solana ETF last week surprised some hopeful observers, who had feared the current government shutdown would delay a regulatory process that had already taken months. Bitcoin Dips Below $100K in 'Mid-Cycle Shakeout' Amid Bond Market Volatility Last week, spot Litecoin and Hedera funds from Canary began trading after the Nasdaq certified their 8-A submissions. Other altcoin-focused funds benefiting from the same SEC rule change may soon also be available to investors. In a Thursday filing to the agency, Bitwise removed a "delaying amendment" from its S-1 prospectus for the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF. "Looks like Bitwise is doing the 8(a) move for their spot Dogecoin ETF, which basically means they plan on going effective in 20 days barring an intervention," Eric Balchunas wrote in an X post on Thursday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON, D.C. — Donald Trump was elected president again one year ago this week, though some of the crypto industry's lobbyists quietly say they feel like they've aged many years in this tumultuous 12 months, which saw a range of lofty highs and deep frustrations in the young sector's hunt for U.S. policies. He quickly issued executive orders demanding progress on friendly crypto policies and the establishment of a bitcoin BTC$102,126.31 reserve to stash the government's holdings as a long-term investment. "Since day one he has issued executive orders and moved for agencies to pay attention to digital assets and how blockchain can increase transparency across the government," said Cody Carbone, CEO of the Digital Chamber, in a statement to CoinDesk. In a stunning example of rapid, bipartisan legislating, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) Act became law, the first major U.S. crypto policy effort to do so. The Trump administration's Treasury Department and banking agencies have already begun trying to sort out its implementation — a lengthy process as it winds its way through public-comment periods and eventually through multiple rule proposals. As he continues goading Congress, Trump has made some consequential appointments to run the U.S. financial regulators. Atkins is a crypto supporter who made friendly new policies his top priority at the agency. He's lately promised concrete rule proposals in the coming months. "The past year has delivered what many thought impossible: a complete reversal of federal crypto policy, transforming America from a jurisdiction defined by regulation-by-enforcement to one that's racing to lead the global digital economy," said Kristin Smith, president of the Solana Policy Institute. Polling has consistently shown voters blame Trump and Republican lawmakers more for the shutdown than Democrats. The budget impasse not only redirects lawmakers' energies toward settling that dispute, but it also has furloughed federal workers who are meant to focus on helping write the legislation. Some crypto lobbyists have privately shifted their expectations as far as 2027 before Congress will finish that job, because next year's midterm elections would be expected to turn Capitol Hill into a political battlefield in which bipartisan action could become difficult. And despite Trump's orders to set up crypto reserves at the federal level, that project hasn't gone anywhere past the planning stage. Like other legislative efforts beyond the market-structure push — such as overhauling the tax code for crypto activity — this one could be waiting in line for a while. Meanwhile, though the crypto industry has lined up a long list of allies among Democratic lawmakers, Trump has drawn sharp criticism from members of the opposition party for his personal stake in digital assets businesses. Also, Trump's successes in appointing regulators, such as at the SEC, OCC and in slowly remaking the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, have been countered somewhat by challenges, such as his having to withdraw his first choice as chairman for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In this opening year of his second administration, Trump's approval ratings have declined rapidly to plumb depths not touched by other recent presidents, with 58% disapproving of the job he's doing — especially the younger voters who had been relatively enthusiastic about giving him a return to the White House. As this week saw a number of state-level elections considered potential bellwethers for the congressional midterms a year from now, the voting public's feelings about Trump's presidency were on potential display. One year after reelecting Trump, they rebounded dramatically toward supporting Democratic candidates. If that takes place on Trump's watch, his crypto agenda may have to adjust to a more overtly bipartisan cooperation during his final two years in office. But Trump's opening year has already provided more policy progress than the industry had ever achieved before, and advocates say it's having significant results on U.S. businesses. "We've seen digital asset companies reshore operations, expand their presence and grow headcounts as a result of President Trump and a pro-crypto Congress," said Summer Mersinger, the CEO of the Blockchain Association who was a recent U.S. commodities regulator in this administration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Weak demand from spot Ethereum ETFs, soft derivatives data, and macro fears have left Ether struggling to sustain $3,400 despite signs of steady onchain activity. Ethereum ETF outflows and cautious traders show limited confidence in ETH price going higher for now. Low derivatives premiums suggest a muted outlook for Ether's price. Traders are now debating whether ETH still has chances to reclaim the $3,900 level. Concerns about global economic growth surfaced after weak quarterly results from consumer-focused companies and renewed worries over high valuations in the artificial intelligence sector. Ether futures are trading at a 4% premium to spot markets, unchanged from the previous week. The data shows a limited appetite for bullish positions, although it has not yet approached panic levels below 0%. Under normal market conditions, this premium typically sits between 5% and 10% to account for the longer settlement period. Related: Cathie Wood's ARK Invest adds BitMine shares as it offloads $30M in Tesla stock November's reading, released Friday, was the second weakest since at least 1978 and was largely blamed on the ongoing US government spending shutdown, AP reported. Part of Ether investors' frustration stems from ETH 4% weekly underperformance compared to the broader crypto market. This suggests that, beyond rising macroeconomic risks, other factors have likely made traders more cautious toward Ethereum. Investors were caught off guard after one of Ethereum's leading decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, Balancer v2, was hit by a $120 million exploit on Monday. Ethereum's design includes a mechanism that burns ETH during periods of high demand for blockchain data processing, helping balance network activity and supply. Active addresses climbed 5% over the past seven days, while transactions rose 2%. By contrast, both Tron and BNB Chain saw declines in onchain activity. ETH trader sentiment has been weighed down by the lack of demand for Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). US-listed products recorded $507 million in net outflows during November, and there were no notable ETH corporate reserve purchases, according to Strategic ETH Reserve data. Currently, ETH's only clear catalyst is the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, slated for early December. However, with derivatives markets signaling weakness and investors wary of a slowing global economy, the chances of a breakout toward $3,900 in the short term appear limited.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Xu also pointed out that the number of FinTech firms has reached around 1,200, representing a consistent year-on-year growth. Xu gave credit to the Hong Kong government's initiatives, saying that they supported this FinTech growth. According to Xu, the current phase of FinTech development in Hong Kong is being shaped by artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and tokenization. For example, tokenization brings in steady income streams from things like electric charging stations or property leases that can be turned into investment products. “There are also pilot projects that look at how to turn long-term rental income into secure and authentic investment opportunities using blockchain,” Xu said. “These are very concrete examples showing how FinTech is being implemented in real-world scenarios.” Xu stated that the future will likely be filled with more companies that are finding innovative ways to apply emerging technologies to financial services. He believes the adoption of AI, blockchain, and tokenized assets will not only make markets more efficient but also create new opportunities for both investors and businesses. The platform allegedly promised unusually high returns on digital asset products, which attracted thousands of local investors. Then, withdrawals were suddenly restricted, and many users found they could not access their funds. This incident led to losses exceeding HK$1.5 billion (about US$190 million). It has been described as Hong Kong's largest financial fraud involving virtual assets. He started by acknowledging that the rapid growth of FinTech also brings challenges. He noted that there is often a gap in public understanding of new technologies and financial products, which can lead to confusion or misuse. “Whether it is daily investor education or the rollout of new financial products, there will always be differences in understanding across the market,” he said. “That is why we must continue to strengthen education and awareness among investors.” We strongly recommend independent research and/or consultation with a qualified professional before making any investment decisions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To enable Ethereum to handle the large transaction traffic from its layer 2 chains, blockchains with a $47 billion on-chain economy built on top of Ethereum. Those chains inherit the base layer's security architecture while offering faster and cheaper transactions. “Fusaka's biggest impact comes from improvements to data availability through PeerDAS, which should make rollups cheaper and more scalable,” Nick Johnson, founder and lead developer of Ethereum Naming Service, ENS, told DL News. Fusaka is the latest checkpoint in Ethereum's development plan. Developers are attempting to scale the $410 billion blockchain so that it can handle 100,000 transactions per second, a massive increase from its current maximum of 30 transactions per second. It targets the data load needed for verifying transactions from layer 2 blockchains. Nodes running on the base layer currently have to download the entire blob data to check for validity. That process becomes more expensive for nodes as layer 2 transactions soar. It also creates a data traffic jam on the base layer. Instead of downloading the whole blob, nodes only need to check random samples within the blob data to verify transactions. Leo Fan, co-founder of Cysic, a zero-knowledge-based blockchain, describes Fusaka as a “deep infrastructural shift” for Ethereum, which could increase the chain's throughput eightfold. Experts like Shiv Shankar, CEO of Boundless, a zero-knowledge scalability protocol, said that this could help improve Ethereum's efficiency. “It lets Ethereum handle more activity, which is good for developers building apps,” Shankar told DL News. However, Fusaka doesn't aim to supercharge Ethereum's layer 2 chains alone. It also includes improvements that directly impact the base layer. These upgrades allow for more transaction processing capacity and increase the number of blobs that layer 2 chains can submit to the main chain.

Currency Series 5 went up for sale on the firm's website and via select retailers on Wednesday, offering its largest-ever selection of crypto redemption cards, which allow collectors to redeem real amounts of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Interest has been both broader and deeper than with any previous Currency set,” Cardsmiths CEO Steven Loney told Decrypt. The latest series of cards can be purchased for as little as $37 for a box containing two packs, with each pack containing 5 trading cards. Cards redeemable for crypto can be found in approximately 1 of every 96 packs according to data shared on the product page. The manufacturer also worked with artists like Gunship Revolution Studios, Jon McTavish, and noted street artist Mr. Brainwash to add a distinctive visual presence to the cards. “From the beginning, our goal was to create truly unique 'One of One' cards for each Currency release. Bitcoin remains the most recognized and valuable cryptocurrency, so it was a natural choice for this concept,” Loney said. Other GameStop customers have shared similar stories thanks to the video game retailer turned collectible firm offering Cardsmiths' products. As for Cardsmiths' future crypto ambitions, collectors can expect more Currency sets ahead. “We have a good handful of exciting launches on the horizon.” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>XRP reclaims $2.30 amid Nasdaq CEO's claim that blockchain could unlock trillions in trapped capital. XRP is showing signs of renewed strength after reclaiming $2.30, with major support levels in place, signaling potential for an imminent upward breakout, according to on-chain analytics from VOGs. XRP has spent the past few weeks consolidating in a tight range, building trader confidence and signaling stability. With rising institutional interest, this steady accumulation sets the stage for a potential breakout, echoing patterns that have historically preceded major crypto rallies. Notably, XRP is trading around $2.31, drawing keen attention from both retail and institutional investors. With momentum building, a push toward $3.50 may be just around the corner. From cross-border transactions to corporate treasury operations, the process is often bogged down by delays, fees, and a lack of transparency. There's just so much trapped, waiting to be utilized more efficiently.” She argued that by leveraging blockchain technology, financial institutions could streamline these processes, reduce intermediaries, and increase liquidity. This could potentially unlock trillions of dollars currently tied up in slow or opaque processes. Diana also highlighted Ripple's role in pioneering blockchain solutions for financial institutions, noting that scalable blockchain networks could provide the infrastructure necessary for global capital mobility. By implementing digital assets and blockchain-based settlement systems, banks and corporations could access liquidity in ways previously thought impossible, bringing a new level of efficiency to global finance. If implemented thoughtfully, it could release trapped capital, empower businesses, and redefine how value moves around the world. Her remarks signal a pivotal moment for both traditional finance and the blockchain ecosystem, pointing to a future where money moves faster, smarter, and more transparently than ever before. Trading near $2.30 with solid support and rising ETF speculation, XRP is poised for a potential breakout toward $3.50. Strong technicals, growing institutional interest, and market accumulation signal that its next move could set the tone for the months ahead, making it a focal point for bullish investors. At Ripple Swell, Fredman emphasizes a pivotal moment for global finance. Blockchain can unlock trillions in trapped capital, boost liquidity, and drive faster economic growth by addressing the inefficiencies of traditional systems. Thoughtful implementation could transform not just transactions, but the very flow of global capital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After weeks of steady decline, Ethereum is finally showing some strength, bouncing back near the $3,460 level. Prominent crypto analyst Ted warns that this sudden recovery might be a “false signal,” suggesting that Ethereum could face one more big drop before a real rebound begins. Here's how low the ETH price can go. While Ethereum's recent 5% daily jump has given traders a brief sense of relief, crypto analyst Ted suggests that this move is likely driven by short liquidations rather than real buying interest. He noted that many traders who bet against Ethereum have been forced to close their positions, creating a quick price push that looks like a rally but lacks strong market support. And the numbers back it up, over $133.83 million worth of ETH positions were liquidated, wiping out both over-leveraged longs and shorts, temporarily boosting prices. His chart highlights strong resistance zones between $3,700 and $3,800, where Ethereum has repeatedly failed to break higher. Until these levels flip into support, the market remains under bearish pressure. But for now, Ted expects another potential drop toward the $2,900–$3,200 zone, which has acted as a key support area before. If that level breaks, Ethereum could slide even further, possibly to around $2,800, before finding solid ground. For now, Ted is watching the $3,200 mark closely. Holding above it could give Ethereum's bulls a chance to rebuild momentum. But if it slips below, another wave of selling could follow. As of now, ETH is trading around $3446, reflecting a 5.2% jump seen in the last 24 hours CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Solana price predictions gain traction as DeFi and NFT growth fuel optimism for a $250 breakout. Analysts see SOL's strong momentum continuing, while Remittix (RTX) emerges as a promising payments token challenger. The Solana price narrative is heating up as DeFi and NFT data indicate the network may be poised for a breakout, while many Layer-1 rivals fall behind. Analysts believe SOL could push towards $250, particularly if usage metrics continue to climb and technical levels are cleared. Meanwhile, payments infrastructure token Remittix (RTX) is quietly carving out a high-utility niche that could drive a bigger breakout than Solana. The network processed over 70 million daily transactions and recorded roughly $143 billion in DEX volume for October 2025. This means the Solana price story is not just speculative. On the technical front, SOL is at a make-or-break point. The 200-day simple moving average (SMA) around $179–$190 recently failed to hold its position. However, underpinned by usage strength, the Solana price remains within an ascending bias in mid-term charts. Analysts caution that slipping below $138 or $120 could lead to further losses. However, Ted Pillows notes that SOL has cleared almost all downside liquidity. Yet, a strong upward move depends on BTC's recovery. While Solana shows DeFi and NFT growth, Remittix (RTX) is tackling real-world payments, a narrative that could create 2025's biggest breakout. It's offering quick, transparent, and private cross-border payments. It has CertiK-verified smart contracts and is running an active $250,000 Gleam giveaway. Analysts say its strong fundamentals and expanding PayFi ecosystem could make RTX one of the best-performing digital assets in 2025. This represents a roughly 20x increase, positioning it as the next big breakout, outpacing Solana.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ISLAMABAD: Pakistanis are estimated to have invested $20-30 billion in asset-backed crypto instruments, experts told the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) Conference on Friday, The News reported. They warned Pakistan risks forfeiting $25 billion in economic opportunities if it delays regulating cryptocurrencies and virtual assets, urging a swift but cautious approach to avoid falling behind in global adoption. They cautioned that weak regulations and cybersecurity risks could hinder progress. Both local and international experts at the conference urged the government to adopt a cautious, phased approach toward legalising cryptocurrency. Experts also recommended that Pakistan introduce a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as a first step, saying it could significantly reduce the costs associated with remittances from overseas. He emphasised prioritising consumer protection and suggested that Pakistan introduce stablecoins in the initial phase. “There are a lot of misunderstandings about digital currency and different thoughts, but we cannot ignore its future and the coming revolution,” he said. Masud added that “there is around $27.6 trillion worth of stablecoins globally and increasing,” calling the development both “a threat to the US dollar's sovereignty” and “a smart step by Washington.” He urged Islamabad to act decisively, saying: “Shape the rules before they shape you.” He also revealed that Pakistan is “seriously considering a rupee stablecoin”. He described the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as a transition “away from printed currency to digitalised currency,” calling it “a clear-cut case of financial inclusion.” However, Masud warned that “cybersecurity remains a major challenge” and that “regulatory ambiguity and negative public perception” persist in Pakistan. Singapore-based expert Yara Wu, who has visited Pakistan four times since November 2024, said that adopting a CBDC could substantially lower remittance transfer costs for Pakistan, offering a secure and efficient alternative to existing channels. Sajid Amin of SDPI said the country needs a clear, consistent approach to digital assets. Faisal Mazhar, Deputy Director of Payments at the SBP, confirmed that “we have been working on digital currency since 2022,” with support from the World Bank and IMF. He described the CBDC as “an evolutionary process,” adding that a prototype is under development before launching a pilot phase. Experts at the conference agreed that digital finance could significantly cut remittance costs, expand financial inclusion, and align Pakistan with global fintech trends — but warned that delay could mean missing a transformative economic opportunity.</p>

Trump Media and Technology Group, a media company pursuing a crypto treasury strategy, held $1.3 billion in Bitcoin as of September 2025, according to Arkham Intelligence.

The company has positioned Bitcoin as a core component of its liquid assets to support long-term treasury goals. A portion of Trump Media's Bitcoin holdings serves as collateral for convertible notes, reflecting integrated financial planning.

Trump Media recently acquired additional Bitcoin as part of its ongoing accumulation efforts, joining a growing number of corporations adopting the digital asset for treasury reserves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A retired teacher says a Bitcoin scam took her life savings — and now she might lose her home. Karla Kelley thought she had set herself up for a nice, comfortable retirement after 30 years of teaching. Karla Kelley, Bitcoin ATM scam victim: “I had worked all my life to get to a point where I had no debt.” Karla Kelley: “They put a fear into me, it's like, ‘Oh, my gosh. Karla says she got an email about her PayPal account and was given a phone number to call. The man on the phone said her account was hacked and criminals now had access to her bank accounts. He said ‘OK, take the $5,000 and put it into it,'” and he gave me a bitcoin machine.” Over the coming weeks, he claimed to be working with the police and said all of her bank and investment accounts were in danger of being stolen. Heather Walker: “I know people are going to be watching and say, ‘How did she fall for this? Scammers use fear to steal billions of dollars from people all across the country. Karla Kelley: “In the very beginning, they told me you cannot tell anybody because it could jeopardize the investigation. So I'm like, ‘Well, all right, the FBI knows what they are doing. I certainly don't want to jeopardize their investigation.' So I didn't say anything to my daughter, my friends, and I lived with 14 months with this fear and anxiety.” Experts say the crooks know exactly how to manipulate their victims. Karen Murillo, AARP Florida: “This is not something to be ashamed or embarrassed about. This is a game of numbers for the scammers; they are targeting us at a crazy rate these days.” A police body camera was rolling as this Texas woman inserted her life savings into a bitcoin atm. Karen Murillo: “These scammers are exploiting the lack of consumer protections.” Karen Murillo: “It's devastating, and Florida needs more protections.” AARP Florida is pushing lawmakers to regulate Bitcoin ATMs and require the owners to pay back people whose money is stolen. Karla Kelley: “I've raised my daughter here, we've had Christmas, Thanksgiving, people all out on the patio, you know, we have a lot of memories here.” Her lesson to others – if anyone asks you to put money in a bitcoin ATM – stop and call police.
