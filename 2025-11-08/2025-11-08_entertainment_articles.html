                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world premiere of Stranger Things‘ fifth and final season Thursday night was a largely joyous affair for everyone involved (save for the time close to 1,000 invited guests had to spend cooped up in the Chinese Theatre with their phones locked as the screening started an hour late.) The cast and creators smiled and posed for photos on the red carpet as they appeared to be enjoying each other's company. That included stars Millie Bobby Brown and David Harbour who hugged and shared a laugh in front of photographers. The two were closely watched at the premiere, their every movement and word scrutinized, as their reunion came days after a Nov. 1 Daily Mail report that claimed that the British actress, who plays girl with supernatural abilities Eleven on the show, had filed a harassment and bullying complaint against Harbour, who portrays her adoptive father Jim. It didn't happen, with the cast and creators presenting united front, Brown and Harbour arriving together, Netflix releasing video of them and Brown posting a joint photo on social. Nobody addressed the accusations directly, with Brown and Harbour praising each other in separate interviews and co-creator Ross Duffer telling THR that “nothing matters more than just having a set where everyone feels safe and happy.” According to sources, there was a tiff between Brown and Harbour, and she did complain about his behavior, however it may not have been as recent as the report suggested, but earlier in the series' run. It was dealt with, and there hadn't been issues since, sources said. Shawn Levy teases how emotional he was watching the final episode (Episode 8) of #StrangerThings Season 5 – which will have a theatrical release on December 31 pic.twitter.com/9qI4ODq8h8 “I was in a magical place 10 years ago when Stranger Things was pitched to Netflix,” Sarandos said, noting that while House of Cards put the streamer on the original series map, “our real moment was when we put on Stranger Things,” a show that “moved the culture.” Stranger Things was the first hit produced and fully owned by Netflix (earlier standouts like House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black came from outside studios), and its massive popularity turned it into a lucrative brand and merchandising bonanza for the tech company. The Duffer brothers thanked the people they considered to have played a crucial role in Stranger Things‘ success, including Dan Cohen, the former executive at Shawn Levy's company who was the first to champion their script after many rejections, Levy who embraced it, Sarandos, who got it on the platform, and the fans who helped to make it into a world phenomenon. They also acknowledged Bajaria for her support of the show over its last two seasons. As Chief Creative Officer at the time, Sarandos did have ultimate greenlight authority, and his role in Stranger Things‘ success is undeniable. Several years ago, the Duffers presented a different version in an essay for Time magazine about Cindy Holland, Netflix's former head of English-language scripted originals under Sarandos. “As it turns out, she's also extremely difficult to read in a room. We left the pitch certain of only one thing: Cindy hated it. The Netflix executives made a point to introduce the Duffer brothers — who are set to leave the streamer in April for a film and TV deal at Paramount that will allow them to make theatrical features and reunite with Holland and another former Netflix exec involved in Stranger Things‘ ascend, Matt Thunell — as being “a big part of the Netflix family.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Both Renner and Zhou also revealed Saturday that they have sent each other cease-and-desist letters over the ordeal. Over the last week, in a series of Instagram posts and a Daily Mail interview, Zhou accused the Hawkeye star of sending her unsolicited “intimate” photos and video and then threatening to “call ICE” on her after she “called him out privately” on alleged misconduct. Zhou, director of the documentary Chronicles of Disney featuring Renner, claimed that she had a personal and professional relationship with Renner that left her fearing for her safety. Renner first contacted me directly in June, sending personal and intimate photographs of himself, behavior that, according to public reports, he has exhibited before,” Zhou wrote on Instagram. She claims Renner wooed her over calls and text discussions, saying he wanted a relationship. However, when the documentary was released last month, Renner “refused to make any public promotion,” despite allegedly having entered into written agreements with her production company. “When I called him out privately about his past misconduct and asked him to behave properly, to respect me as a woman and as a filmmaker, he threatened to call immigration/ICE on me, an act that deeply shocked and frightened me,” she wrote. In a statement to People on Saturday, Renner's lawyer Marty Singer said Zhou's claims were “false, outrageous and highly defamatory,” adding that Zhou was retaliating against Renner after he “rejected her romantic advances” and did not promote their shared projects on social media. However, Singer claims Renner cut off communication with Zhou after she continually sent him “sexually explicit messages expressing her love,” with the most recent one she allegedly sent on Oct. 24. As for Zhou's claim that Renner threatened to call ICE, Singer said the filmmaker “had been relentlessly harassing and threatening my client with hundreds of unsolicited and unwanted messages.” “The true facts are that Ms. Zhou has relentlessly and aggressively harassed and pursued my client for months with no reciprocation on my client's part, other than a single brief encounter on July 12, 2025,” Singer told People. Filmmaker Claims Jeremy Renner Sent Unsolicited ‘Intimate' Images, Threatened to Call ICE on Her TMZ reported Saturday that Renner had sent a cease-and-desist letter to Zhou over the situation; hours later, Zhou responded on social media revealing that she sent Renner a cease-and-desist letter of her own on November 5. These letters show the struggle are about continued sexual images, fans smear campaign and threats involving ICE, they are not because he did not reciprocate in a [relationship] we have been since June.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the 13th season of Hallmark Channel's hit series “When Calls The Heart”  premieres in 2026, at least two past guest stars will return to Hope Valley — Melissa Gilbert, who first joined the cast in 2024, and Brooke Shields, whose character hasn't appeared in a decade. That begs the question: could Lori Loughlin be close behind? On November 7, 2025, series lead Erin Krakow gave Us Weekly an intriguing four-word answer: “I sure hope so.” But in recent years, many fans and former castmates have expressed hope, like Krakow, that Loughlin will be forgiven and allowed to return to Hope Valley. Krakow, whose new movie “Christmas Above the Clouds” premieres on November 8, told Us Weekly, “I love Lori Loughlin, and I love the character she created, Abigail Stanton.” Noting that Loughlin's return is “something I've been hoping for for years and years,” Krakow told the outlet, “I'm very much a fan of hers and a friend of hers, so I really hope that it's happening.” This is not the first time Krakow has publicly advocated for Loughlin's return. “She's an incredible person, a very dear friend,” Krakow said at the time. People don't even know how special a person she is, and it would be wonderful to have her back in Hope Valley.” Even show co-creator Brian Bird said in 2023 that he was open to bringing Loughlin back on the series, stating on the “When Calls The Heart Aftershow” podcast that there had been “good conversations” about her potential return. In 2020, Loughlin served two months and Giannuli served five months in jail, per Us Weekly, and tried to move past the scandal together, with Loughlin slowly returning to acting, including two movies on Great American Family. But in early October, after nearly three decades of marriage, TMZ reported that Loughlin and Giannuli had separated and were no longer living together.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SATURDAY AM: 20th Century Studios' Predator Badlands is looking good, knock on wood, coursing to a very near record opening for the franchise, around $37M, after a $15.6M Friday/previews and the best CinemaScore a Predator movie has ever seen of A-. As we told you, the previous highs for a Predator movie were the original 1987 installment and 1990 sequel which earned B+s. That audience score is further boosted by the Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak definite recommend of 78% and five stars — which is platinum for any movie. It's clear audiences are enjoying this version of Predator from director/producer/writer Dan Trachtenberg and producers Ben Rosenblatt and John Davis, hence the higher-than-expected ticket sales which were expected to be around the $25M range. The movie's momentum is in a better position than Disney's early October attempted tentpole, Tron: Ares thanks to word of mouth. At the end of the day, no matter how much stunting a studio does in a highly competitive social media-streaming landscape, the movie ultimately sells itself; meaning audiences discover it upon viewing and spread the gospel from there. Both Tron: Ares and Predator: Badlands dazzled Hall H at San Diego Comic-Con with equally memorable stunts; the lead character of the latter, Dek, stepping on stage to scan the audience with his eye vision. Rather than just one sheet the fleshy toothy faced guy in a profile shot, Badlands one-sheets really went hardcore sci-fi with epic shots of him battling creatures, etc. What's interesting though is that by going to PG-13, that may not have necessarily brought in a younger audience: Badlands only pulled in 5% for the 13-17 demo. Badlands compared to 2018's The Predator shows that older males still come out for the IP (57% to 45%), as well as older females (about the same between both installments at 22%). Diversity demos are 44% Caucasian, 26% Latino and Hispanic (bigger than The Predator‘s 23%), 15% Black and 8% Asian American. Predator: Badlands has nearly all the Imax and premium large format screens which are driving 53% of the weekend. With a social media universe of 244M across TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and X, Badlands reach is very similar to the reach of Alien: Romulus before opening, that being 246M. Elle Fanning is promoting to her 6.7M fans. Social media data corp RelishMix remarks, “Convo runs positive for Predator: Badlands as fans are lit up at the idea of expanding the Yautja universe beyond Earth, praising its young-blood narrative and connections to Prey and Predators (2010). Comments like ‘Looks fantastic — reminds me when people clowned on Prey and it was awesome,' and ‘Teenage Yautja with something to prove? Others noted the Monsterverse-style shift toward creature-led storytelling, celebrating it as ‘finally giving us the Predator story we've been waiting for.' Regretting You (Par) 3,196 (-229) theaters, Fri $2.2M (+80%), 3-day $7.3M (-7%), Total $38.7M/Wk 3The Constantin $30M production brought into Paramount by former Global Marketing and Distribution Boss Marc Weinstock is bound for $100M worldwide. Sarah's Oil (AMZ) 2,410, Fri $1.7M 3-day $4.4M/Wk 1The best of the adult bunch. No surprise when you realize that it's a Kingdom Story production (their fanbase knows about these faith-based films). A+ CinemaScore which is where faith-based audience scores live. Nothing shocking here: over 55 is 48% of the audience, 66% women. The Zachary Levi movie is playing where these pics play best in the South, South Central and Midwest with 63% of the gross coming from there compared to a norm of 44% for all other titles in the marketplace. Nuremberg (SPC) 1,802 theaters, Fri $1.4M 3 day $3.8M/Wk 1No CinemaScore, but great PostTrak exits of 5 stars, 76% definite recommend, and 93% positive to overshadow those middling reviews of 69% fresh. AMC Grove in LA is the top grossing multiplex with just over $13K. Die My Love (Mubi) 1,983 theaters, Fri $1M, 3-day $2.7M/Wk 1A huge chasm between critics at 78% on Rotten Tomatoes and audiences who dismissed this Jennifer Lawrence-Robert Pattinson melodrama about a woman's depression from Lynne Ramsay with a D+. Remember Lawrence's other big swing from Darren Aronofsky, Mother! Despite the great acting in Die My Love, this is a tough movie about a very sad situation; that's hard if you want to lasso people off their couches. Can't write this enough: Mubi paid $24M for domestic and multiple foreign rights on the movie (versus $12.5M they shelled out for The Substance; that hipster horror pic opened to $3.2M and did a 5.5x multiple with a final domestic of $17.5M). A 29% definite recommend on PostTrak is the kiss of death. Coastal play, which is what these upscale adult movies do, with 50% coming from the East and West. AMC Lincoln Square in NYC is the top grossing location with $12k. Christy (Black) 2,184 theaters, Fri $600K, 3-day $1.25M/Wk 1The biopic about female boxer Christy Martin, Black Bear finance's foray into domestic theatrical distribution, gets a B+ CinemaScore better than A24's MMA movie Smashing Machine which landed an B-. Maybe this builds more momentum today off that and breaks into the top 10. Black Bear put this theatrical release together quite quickly, taking their own movie off the table from domestic buyers and positioning it for an asap theatrical release post its TIFF world premiere. The town says we need more theatrical distributors in an environment where major studios like Paramount and Warner Bros could potentially collapse into each other. Let's see where Black Bear winds up in the long run. It took a while for A24 to build-up its brand; Bling Ring with Emma Watson was one of its early releases and only grossed $5.8M before we got to the Hereditary, Uncut Gems, Everything Everywhere All at Once, etc. FRIDAY AFTERNOON UPDATE: 20th Century Studios' Predator: Badlands is creeping toward the second-best Friday start ever for the franchise at $14M, which would get the Dan Trachtenberg-directed movie to the second-best opening ever for a Predator movie at $33M. The John Davis-produced feature is booked at 3,725 theaters. The best Friday and opening for a Predator movie belongs to 2004's Alien v. Predator with $16.4M and $38.2M, respectively. But Predator: Badlands has some of the best reviews and audience scores for its franchise, plus it cost 52% less than the $220M pricetag of the Jared Leto movie. RELATED: ‘Regretting You' Review: True Love Inevitably Prevails In A Ridiculous Romantic Drama Second place goes to Paramount's Colleen Hoover adaptation Regretting You with a third Friday of $1.9M and third weekend of $6.5M, -17%, at 3,196 theaters for a running total by Sunday of $37.9M. At 2,943 theaters, it's the fourth frame of Universal/Blumhouse's The Black Phone 2 with $4.2M, -50%, after a $1.2M Friday and running cume through Sunday of $69M. Focus Features' third weekend (second wide) of Yorgos Lanthimos' Bugonia is looking at $1.1M today at 2,043 theaters, $3.7M for the frame, -26%, for a total by EOD Sunday of $12.5M. RELATED: ‘Nuremberg' Review: Russell Crowe And Rami Malek In Thrilling And Urgent Nazi Drama More Relevant Than Ever – Toronto Film Festival Sony Pictures Classics' Nuremberg starring Russell Crowe, Rami Malek, Michael Shannon, John Slattery and more is seeing $1.4M today for a $3.5M opening at 1,802 theaters. FRIDAY AM: The Dan Trachtenberg-directed Predator: Badlands speared $4.8 million in previews, which includes both Wednesday fan and Thursday night shows. The preview number is less than that of another sci-fi genre title, Alien: Romulus‘ $6.5M, which also was a franchise reboot for the revived 20th Century Studios under new owner Disney. Also, Predator: Badlands, with its female action hero sensibility, also is getting comperd by Disney sources to Ballerina, which did $3.8M in previews before a $24.5M opening in June. Badlands previews are also ahead of 2017's Blade Runner 2049 which did $3.5M before a $12.5M Friday, and 3-day of $32.7M. Also good news for Badlands at this point in time: Total previews here are ahead of The Predator, which did $2.5M in Thursday previews back in September 2018. 2010's Predators from director Nimród Antal and produced by Robert Rodriguez follows as the second-best U.S./Canada opening for the series at $24.7M. 1987's Predator and 1990's Predator 2 own the best CinemaScores for the series conceived by Jim and John Thomas with a B+. Predator: Badlands cost $105M net before marketing, shot in New Zealand with tax credits. Critics believed the movie should have been booked in theaters, hence, here we are with Badlands. Amazon MGM Studios release of Kingdom Story's Sarah's Oil posted $460K in previews. The Cyrus Nowrasteh-directed faith-based movie starring Zachary Levi, Sonequa Martin-Green and Garrett Dillahunt follows the true story of 11-year old Sarah Rector, an African American girl born in Oklahoma Indian Territory in the early 1900s who believes there is oil beneath the barren land she's allotted and whose faith is proven right. RELATED: ‘Christy' Review: Sydney Sweeney Is A Coal Miner's Boxer In This By-The-Numbers Biopic That Goes Very Dark – Toronto Film Festival Black Bear Finance's first domestic theatrical release under its new arm, Christy, starring Sydney Sweeney as boxer Christy Martin, posted $400K in previews last night. The pic is going wide in north of 2,000. Sony Pictures Classics and Walden Media's WWII drama Nuremberg, booked at 1,700 theaters this weekend, started off with $210K last night in previews. The movie directed and co-written by James Vanderbilt stands at 71% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes from 76 reviews. Mubi's $24 million global acquisition Die My Love starring Robert Pattinson and Jennifer Lawrence is opening wide this weekend as well. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Badlands is a middle of the pack movie but damn, I had fun seeing this in a laser projection theater. If you're a fan of Predator, see this movie and don't let the PG13 rating deter you. It's mainly because of a loophole in the violence area and limited profanity. Oh and for those trying to say this is a woke movie but haven't seen it, you couldn't be further wrong, it's NOT a woke movie so please, stop it already. PREDATOR: BADLANDS is great, but I feel like RUNNING MAN will steal quite a bit of its business in its second weekend. I hope they didn't spend more than 50 mil. Since you inquired, I specifically asked for it. Fan of the series, but not all movies have been worth seeing to be honest. By the same guy who did PREY and KILLER OF KILLERS. Very smart move to not have any red blood but the same amount of action. IF they don't, that's their loss. By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After making its debut to the world, the teaser trailer for Michael, soared to 116.2 million views worldwide in its first 24 hours. That's the largest 24-hour trailer launch ever in Lionsgate‘s history and the most viewed trailer for any music biopic or concert movie in motion picture history. The highly anticipated biopic of the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, outstripped the first 24 hour global trailer traffic of Taylor Swift: Eras Tour, which counted 96.1 million views after an Aug. 31, 2023 drop, as well as Bob Marley: One Love (60.1M views with a trailer debut of July 6, 2023), Bohemain Rhapsody (57.6M, May 15, 2018) and Searchlight's Bob Dylan movie A Complete Unknown (47.2M, July 24, 2024). 'Michael' Teaser Delivers 30M+ Views In First Six Hours; Lionsgate Motion Picture Chair Provides Update On Potential Sequel Lionsgate Sees Mixed Quarter As CEO Jon Feltheimer Says Film, TV Slates Primed For Growth In its first six hours, it had racked up north of 30 million global views, which was 50% more than the trailer traffic over that same period for John Wick: Chapter 4. Moviegoers can see the Michael teaser trailer next weekend attached to the release of Lionsgate's Now You See: Now You Don't.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cult-favorite spy series, which premiered 10 years ago this week on Amazon and ran for two seasons, follows CIA operative John Tavner (Michael Dorman, years before his turn as a lovelorn astronaut on For All Mankind) as he goes undercover at a mundane piping manufacturer in Milwaukee. As the pilot lays out, his mission is, in theory, simple: Get hired at the piping company, join the team on a regularly scheduled work trip to Luxembourg, and make a covert cash handoff there with an Iranian agent who will help secure a more U.S.-friendly regime. John's mission goes rapidly awry with a veritable Rube Goldberg machine of oft-absurd speed bumps, including a CIA goof that gives his false Wisconsin identity one too many Social Security Number digits; John's PTSD dating from a previous job gone bad (and the marijuana dependency he developed while recuperating); and a no-nonsense taskmaster boss (played with malicious aplomb by Kurtwood Smith). Patriot is less interested in dead drops than it is in charting John's plodding march into morally gray situations and mounting depression. It's also very, very funny: One way that John copes is by turning up at open mic nights to perform gloomy folk songs with little concern for OPSEC. In what is likely the former Iranian president's only appearance in a singer-songwriter ballad, one lyric has John crooning about the day the United States learned that “Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was fucking around with new centrifuges.” Later in the song, he sings, “I'm showing several signs of increasing mental instability.” Created by Steven Conrad, best known for writing dreary yet whimsical films like The Pursuit of Happyness and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Patriot never managed to capture an audience during its all-too-short run. “I pitched it to Amazon, and at the time they had an appetite for a show like that,” says Conrad, who admits the concept was a bit of a bait-and-switch from the start. “I think they were banking that the spy genre was going to do a little more legwork than the show that we all privately had in mind.” In the decade since its debut, that sneakily idiosyncratic show with oddball plots and winning performances by beloved characters has slowly but surely made its mark. It sports a bustling subreddit and ongoing word-of-mouth recruits to the fandom. And lately, Prime's recommendations algorithm seems to have taken a shine to it — perhaps mistaking it for a sharp spy game as its human predecessors did, or perhaps not. For viewers and those who had a hand in making the show, the only regret is that there isn't more Patriot to devour. Of Patriot's 2019 cancellation, he says, “I have not forgiven Amazon for this.” PATRIOT ARRIVED COURTESY of Prime's short-lived Pilot Season program, then the cornerstone of the streamer's eager investment in original programming. Barbie's New Día De Muertos Dolls Are Almost Sold-Out (And Could Become a Future Collectible) Before Her Final ABT Performance, Misty Copeland's Children's Book Is Back on Amazon Charts “Ten years ago, the nature of this business was a little different,” Conrad says. TV had a depth then, and an ambition, on the heels of very successful long-term shows like Sopranos and Mad Men. When I asked Terry O'Quinn, who played Tom Tavner — John's father and the senior CIA officer who keeps sending his increasingly battered son into the field — about its initial billing as a spy drama, he told me he'd never thought of the show that way. Indeed, both Tom and John's brother (Michael Chernus) are called in to assist with problems ranging from the meddling of an overqualified Luxembourgish detective to an ill-timed run-in with a puppeteer. Patriot resists easy characterization chiefly because of Conrad's writing, which gives his characters strange rhythms and, sometimes, even stranger verbiage. “Every week or week and a half when we would get a new script, it was like Christmastime,” Smith says. He remembers getting the script for one early episode from Conrad, who cautioned that Smith's character, Leslie Claret, would be delivering a speech that Conrad wanted to film as a “oner” — a single, long shot, with his character on camera nearly the entire time. “Keep it simple,” he starts, before diving into a monologue that includes the promise that “using a field of half-seized sprats and brass-fitted nickel slits, our bracketed caps and splay-flexed brace columns vent dampers to dampening hatch depths of one-half meter from the damper crown to the spurv plinth.” “And he said, ‘No, it doesn't mean anything. They're all words and expressions that I found in various places having to do with piping. To memorize it, Smith invented meanings for all those nickel slits and spurv plinths to give the speech at least some false cohesion. He then spent a month devoting an hour or two every morning to rehearsing it, with another session later in the day with an assistant. The show chugged along nonetheless, gradually attracting fans who adored its stark cinematography and weirdo colloquialisms. “I've had people come up [to me] and they seem to either really love it or they didn't know anything at all about it,” says O'Quinn. The actor is most often recognized for his role as John Locke on Lost, but the fans who know him as Tom Tavner are especially fervent. PATRIOT WAS RENEWED for a second season, which debuted in 2018. Filming took the cast and crew to Paris for a whopping five months. One day of shooting left Smith and O'Quinn, who had become fast friends, riding the Metro for hours on end. O'Quinn remembers confiding to Smith that if it were up to him, he'd just keep on doing Patriot and then retire. “We're both of a certain age,” O'Quinn recalls saying at the time. “If I could just do this for five or six more years and call it a day, I'd be pretty happy.” But Patriot was not to have a long life. I had every sense that we weren't going to have a Season Three.” The changes at Prime meant that Patriot had no champion at the studio level; it got to feeling, Conrad says, like “the show doesn't belong to anybody.” But he believes that the series benefitted from that dynamic in some ways, too, skating through production receiving fewer studio notes than you might expect for a show that often pairs wanton violence with deadpan slapstick. “It was a little more ‘ours' than is ordinary because of all that,” he says. Though it hasn't been so long since its cancellation, it's hard to imagine a show with such an eccentric approach getting the green light today, never mind that kind of creative freedom in production. “When we first started, it was, ‘This is the way television should be,'” says Smith. But the idea creatively is to build a good product. Conrad has penned a real-life version of the Structural Dynamics of Flow and written episodes of a surreal podcast voiced by Smith's character, which Smith says he recorded in a closet at home filled with hats for sound dampening. Conrad is a creator who tends to draw from a recurring stable of actors in all his works, and many Patriot cast members have popped up in his more recent projects, like 2019's spiritually similar thriller series Perpetual Grace, LTD and 2021's stop-motion animated series Ultra City Smiths. The upcoming HBO limited series, DTF St. Louis, which Conrad created and directed, will feature his brother, Chris, a memorable piping colleague from Patriot. I spoke with Conrad, O'Quinn, and Smith at a difficult time for the Patriot team: Last month, Chicago artist Tony Fitzpatrick, who played a delightfully dreadful security guard named Jack Birdbath in Patriot, died. As the news broke, Patriot alumni found themselves calling and texting one another from around the world, sharing memories of Fitzpatrick and their time working with him. No, Taylor Swift Was Not Snubbed at the 2026 Grammys Filmmaker Claims Jeremy Renner Sent Unsolicited ‘Intimate' Images, Threatened to Call ICE on Her On his birthday last year, Smith sat back and wondered what he should do to celebrate. “We watched several episodes, and I was so knocked out by the way things were put together,” he says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” was unexpectedly pulled from its Thursday lineup as Jimmy Kimmel tended to a “personal matter,” sparking concern among fans. Ticket holders for the Thursday, November 6, show were reportedly informed that their taping had been abruptly canceled, according to New York Post. “Tonight's episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live has been postponed. We will contact you to reschedule for a future taping,” one fan shared via Reddit in an apparent screenshot of an email received from the ticket company. I can't wait for you all to see it.” Actor David Duchovny and “Stranger Things” star Joe Keery were both set to sit down with Jimmy Kimmel. ABC ultimately aired a rerun of the October 28 episode, which LateNighter explained was due to a “personal matter” for Kimmel. “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” is scheduled to return with new episodes on Monday, November 10, the outlet revealed. While no further details were shared regarding the postponement, late-night fans showed their support for the host via social media. “I hope it's not due to a family emergency and everything is okay,” one fan wrote via Reddit. “Given what just happened in Sept. any missed tapings makes me anxious. Kimmel's absence raises concern as just two months prior ABC briefly suspended the hit show after receiving pressure from the FCC and station owners. “Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” ABC said in a statement on September 22. So it's was like, ‘Well, I guess we're done.' Neither Kimmel nor ABC has publicly addressed the postponement. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 1963, Bob Dylan was arguably the most celebrated pop artist in America, whose songs were hailed as standards before he could even record them and whose fans considered him to be a living, breathing manifestation of the American folk impulse. That kid wailing on his band's cover of Shirley & Lee's “Let the Good Times Roll” back in St. Paul, Minnesota, could never have predicted where he'd end up in seven years (he'd not even heard of Odetta or Woody Guthrie yet), and the conquering hero closing out his first sold-out Carnegie Hall performance with a spirited and weirdly prophetic “When the Ship Comes In” had already tried to erase his old self from his biography. Most Bootleg installments drop you into a pivotal moment in Dylan's life, a meaningful year or two, but Through the Open Window covers almost a decade during which he made great strides. It plays less like a box set and more like the audiobook of a Great American Novel: a travelogue from the Midwest to Greenwich Village and a coming-of-age story of an artist hitting young adulthood amid the dreamers and schemers of New York City. It follows Dylan as he hangs out in shabby Manhattan apartments, as he lingers over coffee at Café Wha?, and as he tries out new songs and routines and personae onstage. It follows him into tiny Cue Recording Studio and historic Columbia Studio A, to a poorly attended show at the tiny Carnegie Chapter Hall, and finally to his climactic sold-out show at Carnegie Hall. So start with the first track and listen for a while. Imagine those apartments with their thin curtains and bare mattresses on the floor, those clubs with their cigarette smoke and lines of hopefuls waiting for their few minutes on a small stage, those studios with their pristine acoustic tiles and engineers in suits and ties. You couldn't write an opening chapter better than pimply Bobby leading his fellow teenagers through “Let the Good Times Roll.” The lo-est of fi, it is barely legible, and there is honestly nothing noteworthy in the performance beyond who is performing. It's exactly the kind of track, however, that works well in the context of a sprawling box set, partly because it's very short (37 seconds) and mostly because it so perfectly sets Zimmerman up as a nobody who becomes somebody. How many teenagers were obsessed with rock'n'roll in 1956? This kid was only one of a couple million. Later, you can hear the moment he learns about folk music and when he begins his defining obsession with Woody Guthrie: The guitars switch from electric to acoustic, there is more strain and gravity in his performances, the sound of someone trying to live up to the songs he's singing. Where they might have seen the music's history as something that would automatically justify their presence on any stage, Dylan saw that and much more. 9: The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964, Martin Scorsese's No Direction Home, James Mangold's A Complete Unknown, and even Dylan's own Chronicles Volume One. This is the guy who carried around The New York Times with Robert Shelton's article about him, which Dylan would read aloud to anyone within earshot. There's a bit of boastful self-regard there, but also a kind of dumbfounded amazement that he actually exists to other people. At first he sounds most purposeful when he's playing with other people, such as Danny Kalb, a slightly more experienced musician who adds sharp guitar runs to “East Virginia Blues” and “K.C. More telling than his harmonica playing on Harry Belafonte's 1962 cover of Lead Belly's “The Midnight Special” is the tense exchange with producer Hugo Montenegro over a riff Dylan was asked to play on the intro. Belafonte, chill as ever, tells the kid to take his time. While very few of them stuck, you can hear him learning as he goes. The sheer force of his voice is no real revelation, but this compilation explores his developing technique in greater depth than any other Dylan set even attempts. Listen to his stark versions of Guthrie's “Pastures of Plenty” and the country song “Remember Me,” both recorded at a friend's home, and marvel at how he seems to be editing his vocals and guitar playing, removing every note but the most essential. Or cue up the various versions of “Blowin' in the Wind,” regarded as his first masterpiece and a hit for Peter, Paul & Mary before he'd even released his own version, and hear how he lets the song be a little slippery, how he revels in what Sean Wilentz in his lengthy liner notes calls its “ambiguous indeterminacy.” Dylan always pushed against his reputation as a protest singer, despite writing some of the greatest protest songs of the rock era, and he sings this song like he's trying to figure it out himself, finally realizing that it means something completely different depending on who's singing it and in what context. Through the Open Window includes that and other songs from his first appearance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1963, back when he wouldn't dare plug in. If he had divided feelings about the venue and his role there, it doesn't come across in his performance, especially when he leads a choir of contemporaries—Joan Baez, Peter, Paul & Mary, the Freedom Singers, and others—in a rousing sing-along. They all sing “Blowin' in the Wind” with a sense of destiny, as though they are making a new world just by singing this song together. Though known in folk circles, Dylan was still struggling to find a larger audience and break through to the pop market. He signed with Columbia in late 1961, which is roughly where Act II begins. He recorded his self-titled debut with John Hammond producing, but it was not the breakout anyone expected. Here's where you might want to place your bookmark and give that album another listen, just to get a feel for how this young man presented himself to the world; unexpectedly, Bob Dylan might work better as an addendum to this bulky novel than as a standalone release. Even Dylan considered it a failure, both commercially and creatively, and he was moving so fast that these traditional tunes and talking blues were old news by the time it was released. His follow-up, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, did not come easy. He worked through a series of aimless sessions over several months, finally piecemealing an album that wasn't too dissimilar from his debut. At the last minute Columbia decided that “Talkin' John Birch Society Paranoid Blues” was potentially libelous and removed it from the album. Dylan was irate, but it worked out in his favor, as it gave him a chance to quickly record several new songs and redo about half the album, including “Girl from the North Country” and “Masters of War”—two of his best compositions from the era. The new tracklist sharpened his Cold War fears while also introducing more intimate struggles, in particular his insecurities about Rotolo. Through the Open Window could end there, with Freewheelin' hailed as a masterpiece that sealed his reputation with the folkies while bringing folk music to a larger audience. The crowd sounds rowdier than expected, bringing their basket-house manners to this grander venue and seemingly cutting short his introduction to “A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall” with their applause. This Bootleg installment ends with Dylan triumphant, hailed as a hero and a new kind of pop star: not merely an entertainer but an artist. Of course, it wouldn't be long before many of his applauding fans were jeering at him, calling him a traitor for plugging in and writing such inscrutable lyrics. Dylan has always had a strained relationship with this early material, especially those topical songs, and sometimes he kicks against them and sometimes he embraces their possibilities. During these seven years Robert Zimmerman discovered he could be Bob Dylan and Bob Dylan discovered he could be just about anybody.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A representative for actor Jeremy Renner has issued a denial of claims made against the Hawkeye star by filmmaker Yi Zhou, who has alleged that Renner sent her unsolicited nude photographs of himself, and later threatened to call ICE on her when the pair's relationship soured. This is per Rolling Stone, reporting on a long series of Instagram posts from Zhou, who also gave an interview to The Daily Mail about her alleged relationship with Renner. Which, per the artist, model, and filmmaker, began when he solicited her with nude pictures via social media earlier this year, and eventually saw the two collaborate, at least in part, on Zhou's documentary Chronicles Of Disney. (As far as we can tell, the film was released last month, and is built off of interviews conducted with a fairly small collection of people affiliated with the company—including a very noted inclusion of Renner himself in its marketing materials.) Zhou says things soured with Renner after he refused to promote the film, including a request from her that he publicly disavow that the film had been generated with AI. (Zhou is also currently producing an AI-animated film, titled Stardust Future, that Renner was reportedly involved in.) “When I called him out privately about his past misconduct and asked him to behave properly,” Zhou wrote in one of several posts that she's made public since Monday, “To respect me as a woman and as a filmmaker, he threatened to call immigration/ICE on me, an act that deeply shocked and frightened me.” Predator: Badlands brings Star Wars sweetness to film's most lethal hunter By Jarrod Jones November 4, 2025 | 12:00pm SPLINTERI'll Bet the Under On Elon Musk's $1 Trillion Tesla Package ENDLESS MODEI Miss Nintendo 3DS StreetPass, and Games as Physical Community</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ted Lasso and Shrinking star Brett Goldstein has landed his latest streaming project (on both the acting and the creative sides) as Deadline reports that Goldstein has just secured a Prime Video landing spot for his new series Escorted. And while it's not clear, at present, how many other plotlines the show will pull from the rich oeuvre of Rob Schneider's Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo duology—will a very large fishtank, perhaps, feature heavily?—the show does have a pretty good creative pedigree. That most especially includes Goldstein, who will write, produce, and star in the series, alongside Shrinking collaborator Brian Gallivan. The series, which has been given a direct-to-series order at Prime Video, is being produced at Warner Bros. Studios, with Amazon's Amazon MGM studios as a co-producer. (He previously co-created, but never appeared in, a science-fiction anthology show, Soulmates, which debuted on AMC back in 2020, just as Lasso was first taking off. Escorted has been ordered for an eight-episode first season, and will reportedly be a “romantic comedy about second chances, the mayhem of co-parenting, and whether real intimacy can ever be bought”—none of which, if memory serves, were ever addressed directly by the Deuce Bigalow films, so there's clearly some creative room left here to explore.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Olivia Rodrigo is making it clear that she is not happy with the Trump administration (and his Department of Homeland Security) using her music to promote their policies. On Friday, the pop singer slammed the White House and DHS for posting a video about self-deportation using one of her songs. A video posted to Instagram on Tuesday opened with the chaotic, rock part of her Guts favorite “All-American Bitch” showing clips of ICE agents detaining undocumented immigrants with the caption “If ICE finds you,” and then undocumented immigrants seemingly choosing to self-deport with the softer, more peaceful part of the song that follows. In a comment that has since been deleted (although it's unclear if by Rodrigo or DHS), Rodrigo wrote, “Don't ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda.” Since its deletion, fans of Rodrigo have been copy/pasting her original message to remind viewers of Rodrigo's take. In response to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment on the matter, a DHS spokesperson said, “America is grateful all the time for our federal law enforcement officers who keep us safe. Rodrigo has been a loud voice against Trump's policies and racist approach to immigration enforcement. “I've lived in L.A. my whole life and I'm deeply upset about these violent deportations of my neighbors under the current administration,” Rodrigo wrote. Treating hardworking community members with such little respect, empathy, and due process is awful.” No, Taylor Swift Was Not Snubbed at the 2026 Grammys Filmmaker Claims Jeremy Renner Sent Unsolicited ‘Intimate' Images, Threatened to Call ICE on Her Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These categories welcome back a list of familiar faces, specifically in Fred again.., Kaytranada, Disclosure and Skrillex. These artists have tallied a combined 49 nominations and 13 wins, with Skrillex arguably being the Academy's most loved dance artist, with his nine wins going back to 2012. This repeat pool of nominations suggests that the Grammys have found a cadre of dance/electronic artists that are not only worthy, but with whom the Academy feels comfortable returning to again and again. Fred, Skrillex, Kaytranada and Disclosure make up nearly the entire dance/electronic recording category, which is rounded out by Tame Impala's “End of Summer,” a worthy track that carves out space for recognition of the artist's new electronic-focused album Deadbeat, which was released after the 2026 eligibility window closed. Elsewhere, the categories bring in less frequently nominated artists, including FKA twigs and PinkPantheress, both welcome sights to see nominated for dance/electronic album, a category that also includes fellow Grammy favs Rüfüs du Sol, a group that's aggregated six nominations and one win over its career. While none of these nominations comes as a true shock, being that there are only five slots in each category, as always, there were also a few surprises sprinkled across the categories. The culture-permeating earworm that unseated Marshmello and Kane Brown's “Miles on It” from its long reign at No. 1 on Hot Dance/Electronic songs seemed like an obvious choice for a best dance pop recording nominee. “No Broke Boys,” the dance world's unofficial song of the summer, started as an edit heard during Disco Lines' set at EDC Las Vegas in May, getting an official release as a new single with fresh vocals from Tinashe that meshed her 2024 original with Disco Lines' bouncy beat. But just as the song's lyrics go, in terms of 2026 Grammy recognition, there were indeed “no new friends.” The Chicago-born producer and bona fide global phenom was shut out of the 2025 Grammys during his breakout year — a year during which he also released his Grammys-eligible debut album Comfort in Chaos. The academy might have made up for the snub with a 2026 nod, particularly given that Summit's eligible January track “Focus” featuring Cloves marked some of his best and most mature work to date. But even as Summit headlines actual football stadiums, he's apparently and surprisingly still not a focus for the academy. While this latter album was nominated for best dance/electronic album in 2016, In Waves didn't get that acknowledgement, a snub considering how well the project was received and how great it is. With In Waves singles also being submitted for best dance/electronic recording, it's surprising that voters didn't manage to carve out any space for the project or the beloved producer, especially as the academy makes Grammy darlings out of fellow left-of-center indie dance producers like Fred again.. and Kaytranada. One would think that voters might acknowledge Dolla for that contribution, particularly as his hypnotic February single with Daya, “Dreamin',” was rinsed by DJs around the world this year. But never has queen diva Mariah Carey shown up in these categories, until now. Kaytanada's slinky, sexy remix of Carey's 2005 anthem “Don't Forget About Us” brings Carey (who has five Grammy wins to her name) to the dance field, also marking the first remix from UMG's catalog division UMe to ever be nominated. Longtime dance world fav Chris Lake did get a 2026 nomination for his boss remix of The Chemical Brothers' “Galvanize,” but one thought he might also get the nod for best dance/electronic album for his July LP Chemistry, his first ever studio album after a more than 20-year career. Apparently the project, excellent start to finish, didn't quite alchemize with voters. Perhaps it's not actually that much of a surprise, but three years into its existence the best dance pop recording category is basically entirely dominated by pop stars, with Zara Larsson, Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco, Tate McRae, PinkPantheress and Lady Gaga getting 2026 nominations. Given that the dance/electronic fields have historically under-recognized female producers, seeing female artists dominate this category is a welcome development, although this category more and more feels like a space for bona fide pop stars who don't totally inhabit the dance world to just submit their most dance-centric output. The Australian producer is in the midst of her breakout moment, an achievement she's been working towards for years and which she has finally and deservedly realized with her August album I Love My Computer, easily one of the year's best dance/electronic albums. A Grammy nomination would've brought her breakout buzz to a new level while delivering some fresh energy to the nomination fields, but alas, no love.
