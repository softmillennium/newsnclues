                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canadian forward Marius Aiyenero (9) is shown on the ball in Canada's scoreless draw with France, in Group K play at the FIFA U-17 World Cup, at the Aspire Zone complex in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025, in this handout photo. The young Canadians are authoring a new story at the tournament after recording a dismal 0-20-4 record in eight previous trips. Canada ended that winless run in its opening game Wednesday, rallying for a 2-1 victory over Uganda thanks to an 88th-minute goal by Elijah Roche and 98th-minute penalty by Marius Aiyenero. Canada (1-0-1) stands second in Group K, trailing France (1-0-1) on goal difference, and is in good position to move into the knockout round for the first time at the tournament. A win or draw against Chile (0-1-1) on Tuesday will assure the Canadians a berth in the round of 32. “I'm proud of the boys,” said Canada coach Mike Vitulano. “We went toe-to-toe with one of the top teams in the world and showed we belong at this level. We were ready, believed in ourselves, and played on the front foot. “It is a solid performance to build on as our mindset shifts to preparing for an important match versus Chile.” Canada's Tim Fortier was named player of the match. The French, coached by Lionel Rouxel, qualified this time by virtue of finishing runner-up to Portugal at the UEFA Under-17 European Championship in June. France outshot Canada 9-5 (5-1 in shots on target). Vitulano made three changes to his starting lineup with Aiyenero, Shola Jimoh and Johnny Selemani, who all came in off the bench against Uganda, slotting into the starting 11. A Canadian turnover resulted in a chance for Jah-Mason Telusson but his shot was deflected to safety by Roche. Aiyenero was booked late in the half which, coupled with a yellow card against Uganda, means he will miss the Chile contest. The first shot on target, by French captain Abdoulaye Camara in the 48th minute, was easily handled by Canadian ‘keeper Jonathan Ransom. Canada sent on Aidan Evans and Van Parker in the 58th minute. The ball ended up at the feet of Jimoh whose shot was blocked by sliding French goalkeeper Ilan Jourdren. Pierre Moungengue came close in the 83rd minute, dribbling around a Canadian defender only to see his shot bounce off the post. An unmarked Isaiah Bohui had a free header in stoppage time but sent it straight at Ransom. That sent Venezuelan referee Yender Herrera to the pitchside monitor to check for a possible infraction in front of goal on the play. Ahead of the tournament, Aiyenero, Antone Bossenberry, and Sasha Cernic were added to the roster with André Ali-Gayapersad, Owen Graham-Roache and Stefan Kapor withdrawing through injury. The young Canadians booked their ticket to the World Cup in February, topping their five-team qualifying group — featuring host Bermuda, Anguilla, Curaçao and Turks and Caicos — with a perfect 4-0-0 record. They outscored their opposition 28-2 with both goals conceded coming from the penalty spot. Spain's Pedri, Brazil's Neymar and Alisson Becker, England's Phil Foden and South Korea's Son Heung-min are among the world stars who have taken part in the U-17 World Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DOHA, Qatar (November 8, 2025) – The U.S. Under-17 Men's National Team utilized goals from Nimfasha Berchimas and Cavan Sullivan on both sides of halftime to earn a 2-1 comeback win against Tajikistan in the team's second match of the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup. With six points from two matches, the result ensures the USA has clinched a place in the Round of 32 and can claim top spot in Group I with a win or draw in Tuesday's group stage finale against Czechia (9:45 a.m. Heading into the affair, U.S. head coach Gonzalo Segares made four changes to the lineup that defeated Burkina Faso 1-0 in a tight matchup on Wednesday, inserting Luca Moisa, Cavan Sullivan and Mateo Tsakiris in midfield and Chase Adams up front. It was Tajikistan that got off to a hot start, scoring in just the third minute. Intercepting a pass in the U.S. half and darting forward towards goal, Muhammad Nazriev ran onto a lobbed ball over the top from Mehrubon Odilzoda and finished with a powerful strike past ‘keeper Aidan Stokes to give the side a 1-0 lead. Sullivan curled a precise in-swinging cross to the back post where Nimfasha Berchimas elevated himself and confidently nodded home past Tajikistan ‘keeper Rahim Rahmonov. Momentum began to shift in favor of the Americans and a few moments later, Sullivan received the ball in the 18-yard-box and was able to fire off a shot on goal, but the attempt was saved by Rahmonov. The go-ahead goalwas called back following a VAR challenge, as Adams was ruled offside when Sullivan struck the ball. Play resumed and moments later the U.S. quickly moved forward again, with Adams finding himself on the receiving end of a floating cross, heading the ball towards goal only to have Rahmonov make a fantastic diving stop to deny the chance. In a match where the USA outshot Tajikistan 19-2, Segares' side continued to dominant throughout the second half. Adams continued his strong performance early on, forcing himself into the box with the ball, creating enough space to get off a shot, but the ball was deflected and went out for a corner kick. After a quick look, Segares called for a VAR review for a potential handball in the box, but referee Tanguy Bemiame deemed that it did not occur, moving forward with the set piece. In the 74th minute, substitute Jamir Johnson took on his defender coming from the left side and put the ball onto his right foot to fire a shot that careened off the cross bar and out for a goal kick.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristiano Ronaldo and Joao Felix were on target as Al-Nassr comfortably thrashed Neom 3-1 to extend their lead over Al-Taawoun to three points at the top of the Saudi Pro League table. Al-Nassr and Neom played out an exciting first half, albeit goalless, as both teams had numerous chances to break the deadlock. Al-Nassr, of course, dominated proceedings with each of Ronaldo, Joao Felix and Sadio Mane coming close to opening their account in the game but they failed to keep the ball inside the goal. Ronaldo possibly squandered the easiest chance of the half as he failed to keep his header on target from close range. The Saudi giants, though, did not take much time in the second half to open their scoring as in-form midfielder and ex-Chelsea star Angelo Gabriel broke the deadlock with a picture-perfect finish. Just seven minutes later, Neom were dealt another blow as striker Luciano Rodríguez was given his marching orders for a reckless challenge. It was indeed a massive blow for Neom as they had already lost ex-Arsenal star Alexandre Lacazette in the first half due to injury. In the earlier move, Ronaldo had seen his attempt saved from close range by compatriot Luis Maximiano but Joao Felix chased the second ball. The Portuguese forward tried to regain possession, but he was shoved from behind, which led to the spot-kick. Ahmed Abdo pulled one back for the hosts in the 84th minute as Mohamed Simakan was caught napping. Neom's celebrations were, however, short-lived as Joao Felix scored the third and final goal of the game to secure crucial three points. Ronaldo was once again on target as Al-Nassr extended their winning streak in the Saudi Pro League to eight games. Uruguayan striker Rodríguez was the main villain for Neom tonight as his reckless behaviour on the pitch led to his team being reduced to 10 men. Rodriguez should have kept in mind that he was the team's last attacker for the night, especially after Lacazette's injury.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Matthijs de Ligt scored a 96th-minute equaliser as Manchester United managed to snag a 2-2 draw from their trip to Tottenham, snapping a run of four successive losses to Spurs. Thomas Frank's side trailed for much of the game but a late turnaround saw them close in on three points, only for Ruben Amorim's men to claw back at the very last and enact at least some sort of revenge after losing last season's Europa League final. United went in front just after the half-hour mark. Spurs failed to clear their lines when playing inside their own box, and when the ball came back in courtesy of an Amad Diallo cross, Bryan Mbeumo slipped behind Pedro Porro to head in at the far post. Tottenham nearly pulled level on the other side of half-time when Cristian Romero flicked on a Wilson Odobert cross, only for Senne Lammens made a fine save with his feet. With only six minutes to go, United finally caved in. Odobert skipped past Manuel Ugarte with ease before teeing up Destiny Udogie to put in a low cross, which was received by Mathys Tel and finished on the swivel by the Frenchman. What became a manic end to the game opened up for Benjamin Sesko to find a winner when slipped through by Mason Mount, but the Slovenian dawdled on the ball too long and was tackled at the last by Micky van de Ven. Sesko walked away from this challenge injured and had to hobble off, but as United had used all their substitutes, they had to finish the match with 10 players. Entering six minutes of added time, Tottenham turned the game around completely. The Frenchman curled an effort back in, which was flicked on by Richarlison and past a helpless Lammens. Yet there was still time for one final twist. GOAL rates United's players from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium... Stifled Randal Kolo Muani before his half-time substitution and did the same to Richarlison afterwards. No surprise it all went to pot after his substitution. Protected by Dorgu so well that there was little on Shaw's plate to clean up, even despite Spurs seeing more of the ball. Didn't need to worry too much about Spurs' threats on his flanks given how inverted they were on that side. Didn't offer a lot in possession but swept up well when needed. Replaced by the fresh legs of Ugarte, whose introduction effectively cost United two points. One of his better outings since joining United in January. Nullified Spurs' threats coming down his side and stretched play when in possession. Subbed for Dalot with United protecting the lead. Bumped up into the frontline from the off after rescuing a point in last week's draw at Nottingham Forest. Came up with the cross for Mbeumo's goal before moving to wing-back after Sesko's introduction. Was the subject of interest from Tottenham and former boss Frank over the summer, but only wanted United and it's a decision that is already paying dividends. Peeled away from Porro to break the deadlock and extend his fine run of form. Showed flashes of his brilliance though that was about it. Still adjusting to the pace of the Premier League, which became almost too obvious when he was both thwarted and injured by Van de Ven when in on goal. Walked back down the tunnel as United ended with 10 men. Played in Sesko for United's chance to win the game. The starting XI did their job, but Amorim's substitutions nearly cost United any sort of result.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Invest Atlanta's Board of Directors have approved $925,000 in Tax Allocation District (TAD) funding to support local small businesses, the City of Atlanta announced. The funding is part of the city's ongoing efforts to invest in Atlanta's small business community to ensure that “they can fully capitalize on major events coming to Atlanta, including the 2026 FIFA World Cup,” said a press release. Included in the funding is $250,000 in Small Business Improvement Grants, which provides companies with up to $50,000 for various interior and exterior improvements, such as signage, lighting, storefront upgrades and code compliance repairs, to name a few. Recipients of the grants include Bottle Rocket Fine Food & Beverage, Big Daddy's Kitchen, Crates record shop, Strikeout Wingz, and Subs & Salads Junction. “Small businesses are the backbone of Atlanta's economy, and these grants are one way we can help them grow and remain sustainable,” said Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, who also serves as the board chair of Invest Atlanta. Another $500,000 will go into the “Small Business World Cup Opportunity Fund,” an initiative that will distribute microgrants to assist in the accelerated activation of vacant or underutilized small commercial spaces in downtown Atlanta, as well as create opportunities for small businesses in advance to the 2026 FIFA World Cup. In charge of administering the microgrants is Invest Atlanta's downtown community development partner, Central Atlanta Progress, a nonprofit whose goal is to bolster the economic vitality of downtown Atlanta, according to its website. “Atlanta's small businesses are the heartbeat of our city,” said A.J. “By investing in them, we are investing in the character of our neighborhood — something that will be on full display during major events like the World Cup.” Once built, the development will offer free soccer programming and is slated to serve 200 players between the ages of 6-12, said a release.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Portugal follows with 10, while France and Spain has eight representatives each one. + Premier League becomes Ancelotti's main source for Brazil squad Raphinha (Barcelona) – Best Player & Team of the Season Raphinha enjoyed his most complete campaign since joining Barcelona. With pace, flair, and sharp decision-making, he played a key role in their LaLiga and Copa del Rey triumphs, while also shining in the Champions League. A cornerstone of the Premier League title-winning side, Alisson pulled off match-winning saves against Arsenal and Chelsea, while maintaining top form in Europe. In the tournament, his calm under pressure and decisive saves — including a man-of-the-match performance — proved why experience still matters. A model of consistency, Weverton was pivotal in Palmeiras' strong Libertadores and Brasileirão campaigns. He starred for Botafogo, anchoring the defense during their Brazilian League and Libertadores title runs, before earning a midseason move to Nottingham Forest. His rise reflects the new generation of Brazilian goalkeepers making their mark abroad. Back home at Fluminense, Thiago Silva proved that class truly is timeless. His composure, positioning, and leadership against elite opposition reaffirm his status as one of the great defenders of the modern era. + Sons of Cristiano Ronaldo, Thiago Silva and other football stars begin to shine Dominant in both league and European matches, his performances against top-six rivals cemented his reputation as one of the Premier League's finest defenders. Vinicius Junior (Real Madrid) – Team of the Season Although not as dazzling as in the 2023/24 campaign, the Brazilian star remained one of Real Madrid's top performers, showcasing trademark dribbles and flashes of brilliance. With flair and fearless dribbling, Luiz Henrique was the creative spark behind Botafogo's 2024 Libertadores triumph, earning him the “Rei da América” (King of America) award. The breakout Brazilian of the Premier League season, João Pedro dazzled for Brighton before maintaining form after a big move to Chelsea. The FIFA The Best 2025 Awards ceremony will take place in Zurich this December, and anticipation is sky-high for Brazilian fans. In last year's edition, Vinícius Júnior stole the show, winning The Best 2024 Men's Player Award after a spectacular season with Real Madrid. Then, a public vote on FIFA's official website (open until November 28) determines the three finalists in each category. In the final phase, national team coaches and captains from FIFA's 211 member associations, selected journalists, and fans worldwide cast their votes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Caledonia will represent the OFC at the six-nation FIFA World Cup 26™ Play-Off Tournament and will soon learn who they will face in pursuit of their first-ever FIFA World Cup™ appearance. Their place in the tournament was secured after reaching the final of the FIFA World Cup 26™ Oceania Qualifiers against New Zealand. The draws will define the routes the 22 competing nations – six via the Play-Off Tournament and 16 through European Play-Off matches – will need to successfully navigate to seal a spot at the first-ever 48-team FIFA World Cup™, which will be staged in Canada, Mexico and the United States from Thursday, 11 June to Sunday, 19 July 2026. Twenty-eight teams have already booked their places at next year's historic tournament, with a further 14 nations – three from Concacaf and 11 from UEFA – set to punch their tickets to the finals via confederation qualifying this month. The European Play-Offs will be made up of 12 group runners-up and the four best-ranked UEFA Nations League section winners. The 16 teams who enter will be drawn into four play-off paths, with four teams in each. Play-off matches will be played in single-leg semi-finals followed by single-leg finals to decide Europe's final four FIFA World Cup 2026 participants. To ensure both draws can be conducted in accordance with the relevant draw procedures, the next edition of the FIFA/Coca-Cola Men's World Ranking will be published on Wednesday, 19 November 2025. Fans around the world will be able to follow the draws live on FIFA.com, FIFA+ and via FIFA media partners. Further details, including additional broadcast information, will be published on FIFA.com in due course.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Pulisic could be good to go for AC Milan this weekend. The U.S. men's national team star wasn't named to coach Mauricio Pochettino's squad for two upcoming friendlies, but he could be on the pitch for Massimiliano Alegri's side for Saturday's Serie A game against Parma. Pulisic has been hampered by a right hamstring injury since exiting the first half of the U.S. men's national team's 2-1 win over Australia on Oct. 17. But Allegri said the 27-year-old winger could be ready for action. "We've got Pulisic back, who is doing well and available to play," Allegri said. Pulisic was not named on Pochettino's roster for the USMNT's friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay on Nov. 15 and Nov. 18. The Rossoneri are in third place in the Serie A standings, just one point behind defending champions Napoli. As well as providing an update on Pulisic, Allegri also said that Mexico striker Santiago Gimenez and French midfielder Adrien Rabiot would be fit to return from their injuries following the November international break.
