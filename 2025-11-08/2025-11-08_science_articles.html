Mariana Lenharo is a news reporter for Nature based in New York City. Traci Watson a senior editor for news and research highlights at Nature. James Dewey Watson — who won the Nobel Prize for his role in divining the structure of DNA; was instrumental in initiating and propelling the Human Genome Project; and who became notorious for his history of racist and sexist comments — has died at 97. “For him, nothing was impossible,” says Robert Martienssen, a geneticist at Cold Spring Harbor. What Rosalind Franklin truly contributed to the discovery of DNA's structure What Rosalind Franklin truly contributed to the discovery of DNA's structure Nancy Hopkins, a molecular biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, says that Watson convinced her to pursue her PhD, at a time when few women pursued careers in science. Or I'll sue them,” Hopkins says Watson told her. Hopkins later became a vocal advocate for women in science and says that she is just one of many women Watson trained and supported. A 2001 lecture at the University of California, Berkeley, left many in the audience stunned when Watson made remarks linking skin colour to sexual libido, and thinness to ambition. “What happened later on, I just don't know the answer.” The institution severed ties with him completely after he made similar remarks in 2020.
