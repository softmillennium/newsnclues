Former President Joe Biden told a Nebraska audience that the Democratic Party is "back" after sweeping election wins and accused President Donald Trump of trampling on the Constitution and cutting healthcare funding. Former President Joe Biden told Nebraska Democrats on Friday that their party "is back" after a series of sweeping election wins last week and also accused President Donald Trump of destroying the Constitution and cutting health care and food assistance for millions of Americans. Biden, 82, speaking at the Nebraska Democratic Party's "Ben Nelson Gala" in Omaha, also urged Republicans to end the ongoing government shutdown and said his late son, Beau Biden, should have been president, not himself. "Did you see the election results?" Former President Joe Biden speaks during the "Ben Nelson Gala" on Nov. 7, 2025, in Omaha, Neb. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J. and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., won gubernatorial races in their respective states, while Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani scored a stunning victory to become New York City's next mayor. The wins came a year after former Vice President Kamala Harris suffered a stinging defeat to Trump. Harris was propelled to the top of the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket after Biden backed out of the race following a blistering debate performance against Trump. "Well, the American people are sending a message, a message to Trump and to his crowd," Biden said, accusing the president of trampling on democracy and working for the rich. We don't work for you," Biden said. "You work for us, not just billionaires and millionaires. But you act in a way that embarrasses the nation." Biden said Trump and the GOP were cutting health care programs and driving up costs, adding that more than 300 rural hospitals in America, including two in Nebraska, are expected to shut down.

Biden, who had a bandage on his head, referred to his own battle with cancer and praised the health care workers who have been treating him. He was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer earlier this year. "I know what cancer research means. It hit my family hard, just as so many of yours," Biden said. "When the love of my life, my oldest son, the attorney general of the state of Delaware, who should have been the president, not me, volunteered to go to Iraq for a year, didn't have to, came back with stage four glioblastoma because he lived in a burn pit just like those guys did on 9/11, and he died." Biden also took aim at Trump's plans to build a new ballroom at the White House after bulldozing the East Wing, calling it "the perfect symbol of his presidency." "When I left the presidency, President Trump was going to take a wrecking ball to the country, but I had no idea it would be an actual wrecking ball," Biden said. Zohran Mamdani delivers a victory speech at a mayoral election night watch party, on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, in New York City. He also accused Trump of "deliberately making hunger worse" and claimed "one in five children go to bed hungry every night." He mocked Trump for holding a "Great Gatsby" themed Halloween party at Mar-a-Lago while cutting food aid for millions, saying it showed "who he is." "On Friday, everyone dressed up like the rich folks they are from the Roaring Twenties and on Saturday he cut assistance to 40 million Americans," Biden said. The White House did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment. You can send tips to michael.dorgan@fox.com and follow him on Twitter @M_Dorgan.

Newly re-elected Minneapolis Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey is facing backlash from conservatives for giving a victory speech in Somali and saying that Minneapolis welcomes Somalians. In a video of the speech posted online, Frey can be seen leading chants in Somali as the crowd responds and applauds. "Mayor Jacob Frey, as he won reelection, spoke almost a minute in Somalia then said Minneapolis belongs to Somalia," said Szypula. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey speaks during a press conference at City Hall following a mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School on Aug. 28, 2025 in Minneapolis. In a second round of nonpartisan ranked-choice voting, Frey narrowly defeated a challenge from socialist Minneapolis state Sen. Omar Fateh. Tim Walz, D-Minn., who was former Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate last year and is up for re-election next year, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., endorsed Frey's campaign this year. While speaking with a crowd of Somali residents after his victory, Frey repeatedly thanked the crowd in Somali. Then Democratic socialist mayoral candidate Omar Fateh is seen in Minneapolis, Minnesota on July 19, 2025. "To the great people of Minneapolis, and I say that very intentionally, because no matter where you are from, Minneapolis should be a place where you are proud to call home," he said. He then proceeded to list off a number of Somalian regions, saying, "Whether you are from Bosaso or Mogadishu, whether you are from Hargeisa or Garowe, whether you are from Beledweyne or southwest, Minneapolis is a place where you come to seek prosperity, where you come to raise your family." Conservative pundit Gerry Callahan slammed Frey's speech, saying, "This is an American politician, raised in America, educated in America, ostensibly representing Americans, prostrating himself in front of bunch of foreigners. Could be the most humiliating thing I've ever seen." Podcaster Matt Walsh also chimed in, writing, "As I have said many times now, politicians in this country should be required by law to speak English when addressing the public in an official capacity. There should never be a time when Americans can't understand what their elected leaders are saying." Campaign signs for Minneapolis mayoral and city council candidates, including Omar Fateh and Jacob Frey, line a fence in Cedar–Riverside. Nick Sortor wrote, "I don't know how large ICE's presence in Minneapolis is, but it needs to be much, MUCH larger." Fox News Digital reached out to Frey's team for comment, but did not immediately receive a response. This is not the first time Frey has garnered criticism over Somali-language political messaging. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, commented on the ad, saying, "This must be stopped." Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., also reacted to the ad, posting a disapproving gif. which is an acronym for "what the actual f---." Having entered office in 2018, Frey was elected to his third term as Minneapolis mayor on Tuesday. He is best known for marching with protesters during the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots, which were particularly destructive in Minneapolis, the city in which George Floyd died. Frey was also seen kneeling and weeping by Floyd's casket at a memorial service. Peter Pinedo is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

Country star John Rich of the music duo "Big & Rich" spoke with Fox News Digital about his endorsement of Jody Barrett in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District. FIRST ON FOX: A Tennessee Democratic state representative running for Congress, who has been likened to Zohran Mamdani, claims she is running to make life better for the working class, but her voting record tells a different story. Tennessee state Rep. Aftyn Behn, D-District 51, who is running to replace outgoing Congressman from Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, Mark Green, voted no last year on a bill that would have resulted in a $400 million tax cut for certain Tennessee small businesses, including potential refunds of up to $1.5 billion. 1, the so-called "one, big beautiful bill," which extended Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts that, without, could've meant a nearly $4,000 increase for taxpayers in her district. Meanwhile, earlier this year, Behn voted against a statewide budget bill that would have added tens-of-millions to the state's rainy day fund, which would have effectively padded the state's coffers so that in times of low-revenue taxes won't need to be increased so much. That same budget bill would have also allocated millions for volunteer fire departments, senior centers, emergency medical services, teacher bonuses and other public safety funding. Democrat Aftyn Behn, a current Tennessee state representative, is running to take over Republican Mark Green's old seat following his retirement. "A pissed-off social worker, Aftyn has seen firsthand how broken systems fail the very people they're meant to protect," Behn's campaign website reads. However, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation, if Trump's 2017 tax cuts had expired, residents in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, whom Behn wants to represent, would have seen an increase in their taxes of approximately $3,717 per taxpayer. "To win, Democrats need to focus on what really matters: making life more affordable for working people," Behn said after the bill's passage. "Washington Republicans did the opposite by passing this #BigBullsh--Bill. Even the New York Times has admitted that independent analyses showed Trump's 2017 tax cuts "have consistently found that a large majority of Americans would owe less because of the law." Last year, Behn also voted against a bill that the Tennessee General Assembly Fiscal Review Committee estimated would provide over $1.5 billion in tax refunds for small business owners in the state. It also would have reduced a combined yearly tax burden for Tennessee business owners of about $400 million. Simultaneously, Behn voted against Tennessee's 2025-2026 fiscal year budget that included a big increase to the state's rainy day fund, which is used by state governments during periods of low revenue. The same budget bill also included community funding for services like volunteer fire departments, emergency medical services and rescue squads, senior centers, teacher bonuses, school security and more. However, according to Republicans, the move would create a business enterprise tax, raising taxes on small businesses by about $800 million. Fox News Digital reached out repeatedly to Behn's campaign for comment but did not hear back. "Aftyn has repeatedly voted against tax cuts and proposed new taxes, taking more money from your pocket. I'll always fight to lower taxes and bring down costs so that working families can get ahead." In local media reports, Behn has been compared to New York City mayor-elect and self-proclaimed socialist Zohran Mamdani and the Dickson County Democratic Party described Behn as "our very own AOC of TN," in a reference to U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. "His message is one of helping working families across New York, my message is one of helping working families across Tennessee," Behn said about Mamdani during the appearance on CNN. "We need to go back to pocketbook issues, especially in states like Tennessee where people are living unaffordable lives and suffering as a result of Republican policies."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision not to seek reelection next year could open the floodgates on the race to replace her. Pelosi, who has served in Congress since 1987, already had two primary challengers ahead of her Thursday announcement: Saikat Chakrabarti, a former chief of staff to US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic California state Sen. Scott Wiener. Chakrabarti launched his bid to unseat Pelosi earlier this year as part of a wave of younger Democratic challengers who argued the party needed candidates with new ideas to reshape it in the wake of Republicans' 2024 electoral wins. But he argued that it was necessary to get in against Chakrabarti, a self-funder who made his millions in the tech industry. “But there are limits to how long you can wait. Other candidates are expected to announce their own bids. San Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan has been floated as a potential candidate and former San Francisco Mayor London Breed told Politico Friday she is considering running. Already, the field of prospective and declared candidates has sparked discussions about what kind of leader the district should elect to represent a rare, solidly blue open seat. Here's how the field is shaping up so far: Chakrabarti launched his campaign to unseat Pelosi in February, arguing that while he respected what she had accomplished during her career, the Democratic Party needed new leaders who could meet the current moment. He helped kick off a wave of young challengers who argued the party needs to be completely overhauled. He praised Pelosi for deciding not to seek reelection. “I think it's a continuation of her leadership, to actually step down from power,” he said in an interview. “It's a very rare act of leadership in Washington, DC.” He went on to work on independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, helped found Justice Democrats, a progressive group that backs primary challenges against centrist Democratic incumbents, and managed Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 congressional campaign. Wiener has focused on housing policy and LGBTQ rights during his nearly 10 years in the state Senate. He's also set up a robust fundraising operation – his campaign announced that it had raised more than $730,000 on the day he launched his bid last month, before Pelosi announced her plans to retire. Wiener said the presence of a self-funder like Chakrabarti in the race, and a looming filing deadline, spurred him to jump in. Dan Newman, a San Francisco-based Democratic strategist, said that his decision to jump in early was “risky” but proved to be smart. California's congressional filing period doesn't begin until early next year, at which point several Democrats and few Republicans could enter the race. Chan, who was first elected as a supervisor in 2020 and views Pelosi as a mentor, could garner support from progressives and labor leaders. Pelosi has not endorsed in the race, but political observers have noted the former Speaker and Chan worked together to pass Democrats' redistricting push, Proposition 50. “This moment is about thanking Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi for her legendary public service, and honoring her and her family for their extraordinary commitment to San Francisco and to bettering our entire country,” Chan said in a statement. The latest congressional hopeful to signal interest was Breed. “It's important that San Franciscans have options,” Breed told Politico. Newman said that, for years, conventional wisdom held that the younger Pelosi would pursue the seat when her mother retired. “If Nancy picked somebody off the street, then that gives them a little bit of instant credibility,” Newman said.</p>

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., joins Fox & Friends Weekend to discuss the impact of the ongoing government shutdown. President Donald Trump has urged Senate Republicans to abolish Obamacare and reroute federal health care spending directly to individual Americans. In a Truth Social post Saturday morning, Trump wrote: "I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over." President Donald Trump has urged Senate Republicans to abolish Obamacare and reroute federal health care spending directly to individual Americans. The post marks Trump's latest push to revive his long-running campaign against the Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, a centerpiece of former President Barack Obama's domestic legacy. Trump and Republicans have renewed their criticism of the program amid the government shutdown, arguing it drives up costs and enriches insurance companies at taxpayers' expense. Trump spent much of his first term trying to repeal the law. Congress remains deadlocked over government funding, with health-care programs and insurer subsidies among the major budget sticking points fueling the shutdown. Senate Majority Leader John Thune holds a copy of a continuing resolution bill as he speaks alongside Speaker of the House Mike Johnson during a news conference in Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol Building on Oct. 3, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) House Speaker Mike Johnson on Thursday told reporters Thursday that he would not commit to holding a vote on extending COVID-19 pandemic-era enhanced Obamacare subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of this year without congressional action. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., had been floating a vote on such an extension in exchange for Democrats voting to end the shutdown. The issue of enhanced Obamacare subsidies has been a matter of debate within the GOP, with some Republicans in more moderate districts calling for at least a year-long extension to give lawmakers time to create a new healthcare deal in its place. Trump also once again called on Republicans to end the filibuster, the procedural rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation. "Unrelated, we must still terminate the Filibuster!"

You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here. One week after national outlets reported that the Justice Department had opened a fraud investigation into the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, the organization announced Friday that it had severed ties with longtime strategist and board member Shalomyah Bowers, citing a “leadership transition.” The move sharpened scrutiny of the organization's finances and governance just as federal authorities examine whether tens of millions of dollars raised in 2020 were misused, according to legal experts and nonprofit researchers who have tracked the organization's scandals. In a Nov. 7 letter to supporters, BLMGNF said Bowers's “time on the board has come to an end” and that his consulting firm's work with the group had ceased. Federal scrutiny comes amid years of controversy surrounding the foundation's finances. In 2022, Sean Campbell reported in New York Magazine that BLMGNF used nearly $6 million of donated funds to purchase a 6,500-square-foot Los Angeles property through an LLC connected to the law firm Perkins Coie. The house was initially described as a creative hub, but records showed it had also been used for private events and personal filming projects. The filing also disclosed payments of more than $2.1 million to a consulting firm run by Bowers, nearly $970,000 to a company founded by the father of co-founder Patrisse Cullors's child, and more than $840,000 to a security firm operated by her brother. Experts said the transactions, while not necessarily illegal, illustrated weak internal controls and potential conflicts of interest for an organization of such size and prominence. Nonprofit attorneys called that lack of independent oversight a major red flag for the IRS. Cullors stepped down as executive director in 2021, later admitting she had stayed at the Los Angeles property for several days and hosted two private parties there. In 2022, a separate entity known as Black Lives Matter Grassroots sued Bowers and the foundation in Los Angeles County Superior Court, accusing him of diverting about $10 million in donations for personal use and turning the nonprofit into a “personal piggy bank.” Bowers denied any wrongdoing, and in June 2023, a judge dismissed the case under California's anti-SLAPP statute, finding the plaintiffs lacked standing and failed to substantiate their claims. Thayer also pointed to BLMGNF founder Cullors's previous admission that she found preparing IRS filings “triggering,” and argued that her reaction betrayed an awareness of deeper problems. “You don't get scared by paperwork unless it reflects reality,” he said. Legal analysts say that any criminal investigation would likely hinge on patterns of wire fraud, tax violations, or false filings with the charity. He added that prosecutors would also look at possible conspiracy and fundraising-fraud angles. “And did they mislead donors about how their money would be used?” He also suggested the statute-of-limitations clock could still allow prosecutors to act. “People were still donating into 2021, so those transactions are well within the window,” Shu said, noting that a standard five-year federal limit would likely govern probable wire-fraud or tax-related charges. “The first thing they have to do is get a grand jury together, because only the grand jury can issue subpoenas — not only for testimony, but for documents, hard drives, and emails.” BLMGNF has insisted it is not a target of the investigation. The group plans to expand its board, tighten conflict-of-interest policies, and conduct an external audit as part of broader transparency reforms. BLMGNF did not respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner.</p>

Students at NYU, Baruch College, Columbia and Barnard College sat down with Fox News Digital and revealed the truth about how professors promote biased beliefs on campus. EXCLUSIVE: A number of students revealed the "extremist" viewpoints held by some university professors that "play a role" in fostering an antisemitic environment on campus, condoning anti-Israel protests and maintaining a bias message that is "not exactly something that should be promoted" at their respective schools. Jewish students from NYU, Columbia, Barnard College and Baruch College sat down with Fox News Digital during an exclusive interview and exposed the "disturbing things" that have been said by professors at some of the top schools in New York City and in the U.S. "I've had many peers share very disturbing things that professors have said in class, whether it's in courses specifically related to Middle Eastern politics or in classes that should be completely absolved of anything happening in the Middle East," TJ Katz of Columbia explained. Jewish students from several top New York City universities told Fox News Digital that some professors are promoting extremist, antisemitic and anti-Israel rhetoric in classrooms, creating a hostile environment for Jewish students. "Just the presence of these professors on campus, you know, a lot of them on their offices have signs saying things like, hands off our students, and they have free Palestine signs on their doorways," Eliana Birman of Barnard explained. "I had professors that were antisemitic," Aidan Herlinger of Baruch told Fox. "I know students that have had professors that are antisemitic, we are put in positions where we can't do anything about it, because it could cost us our grade." "We need to extricate extremists from the classroom, do departmental audits," Shoshana Aufzien of Barnard added. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, hundreds of students and non-students have been arrested as a result of riots. NYU faced similar, though less intense, protests on its NYC campus, including a Dec. 12, 2024, demonstration outside the university's library where protesters called for an "intifada revolution" saying that "Tel Aviv is stolen land." Skoblo outlined her fears as a Jewish student on campus, saying that "a lot of us are scared." A pro-Gaza ceasefire tent encampment at Columbia University on April 28, 2024. "The past two years on college campuses across New York City have been difficult for Jewish students," Skoblo told Fox. We've been blocked out of our own library during finals week." "How are we supposed to study when we hear chanting that shouts towards our destruction, makes us feel unsafe and unheard," Skoblo added. When asked if faculty influenced or pressured students to adopt a specific stance in the Middle Eastern conflict, Aiden Herlinger from Baruch College said, "I think the professors definitely play a role." While the students explained that antisemitism has existed on college campuses for some time, students noted that the recent rise in tensions and anti-Israel rhetoric that came after Oct. 7, 2023, could be attributable to professors indoctrinating or influencing students to participate in demonstrations, some of which turned violent and led to expulsions, suspensions and arrests. Police arrested more than 100 students at New York University who were protesting in support of students at Columbia University and to oppose Israel's attacks on Gaza. As for the consequences these professors may face for being accused by their own students of indoctrinating, Herlinger said there will likely be none. "[Professors are] not going to face any consequences, especially in a school like Baruch that's a public school, and it's funded by the New York State government, and New York City government," Herlinger added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Travelers wait and check for their flights at San Francisco International Airport on Friday, Nov. 7, 2025. A Southwest Airlines airplane is seen through the structure at Reunion Tower as it flies over Dallas after taking off from Dallas Love Field Airport Thursday, Nov. 6, 2025. Planes are seen in front of an air traffic control tower at Newark International Airport in Newark, N.J., Thursday, Nov. 6, 2025. If you have upcoming travel plans anytime soon, you might notice fewer options on the airport's departure board. Airlines are scaling back flights at dozens of major U.S. airports to ease the pressure on air traffic controllers, who have been working unpaid and under intense strain during the ongoing government shutdown. Many controllers have been putting in long hours and mandatory overtime while lawmakers are at a standstill over how to reopen the government. Major hubs like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago are among those affected, and the ripple effects could mean more cancellations, longer delays and fuller flights for travelers across the country. The cutbacks will impact hundreds if not thousands of flights daily. Here's what to know about the FAA's order — and what you can do if your plans are disrupted: The list spans more than two dozen states. It includes the country's busiest airport — Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia — and the main airports in Boston, Denver, Honolulu, Las Vegas, Miami, San Francisco and Salt Lake City. Multiple airports will be impacted in some metropolitan hubs, including New York, Houston, Chicago and Washington. Even if the shutdown ends soon, the FAA has said it would not lift the flight restrictions until staffing at airport towers and regional air traffic centers makes it safe to do so. “It's going to take time to work through this,” said Michael Johnson, president of Ensemble Travel, an association of travel agencies in the U.S. and Canada. That's why, he said, it's important to plan ahead — whether you've already booked flights or you're just starting to make holiday travel plans. Still, it doesn't hurt to check your airline's app or a flight-tracking site for updates before you leave for the airport. It can also help to reach out on the social platform X because airlines might respond quickly there. Now might also be the time to consider if it makes sense to travel by train, car or bus instead. Kyle Potter, executive editor of Thrifty Traveler, said the shutdown is different from when a single airline is having problems and travelers can just pick another carrier. However, they aren't required to cover extra costs like meals or hotel stays — unless the delay or cancellation was within their control, according to the Department of Transportation. You can also check the DOT website to see what your airline promises for refunds or other costs if your flight is disrupted. You might just need a little more planning and flexibility than usual. A travel adviser can help take some stress off your plate, and travel insurance may give you an extra safety net. Johnson also warned that flights could sell out fast once the shutdown ends. “There will be a flurry of booking activity,” he said. “So try to get ahead of it and make sure that you're protected.” Booking an early flight can also help, says Tyler Hosford, security director at risk mitigation company International SOS. If it gets canceled, you still “have the whole day” to sort things out. Limiting baggage to a carry-on means one less airport line to deal with, and if your plans change unexpectedly, you'll already have everything with you. Give yourself extra time at the airport, especially if you're an anxious flyer or traveling with young children or anyone who needs extra help getting around. Airline agents are likely helping other frustrated travelers, too, and yelling won't make them more willing to help.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Palestinians rush toward trucks carrying aid from the World Food Programme (WFP) as they drive through Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025. Displaced Palestinians walk through a makeshift tent camp in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis, in the Gaza Strip, Saturday, Nov. 8,2025. Bodies of unidentified Palestinians returned from Israel as part of the ceasefire deal are brought to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025. His remains were returned from Israel as part of the cease-fire deal and brought to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025. Displaced Palestinians walk among the ruins of destroyed buildings in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025. The toll also includes Palestinians killed by strikes since the truce took hold, which Israel says target remaining militants. Israel on Saturday returned the remains of another 15 Palestinians to Gaza, according to hospital officials in the territory, a day after militants returned the remains of a hostage to Israel. He was identified as Lior Rudaeff, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's office. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said that Rudaeff was born in Argentina. For each Israeli hostage returned, Israel has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians. It began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage. Also Saturday, Israeli settlers staged two attacks on Palestinian farmers, paramedics, activists and journalists in the occupied West Bank as settler violence reaches new highs in the territory. Palestinians on Saturday checked the newly returned remains. “We do not have sufficient resources or the DNA to match them with the martyrs' families,” Dheir said. Hopeful families looked into the body bags of decomposed remains. I am still waiting for him,” said the mother of a missing boy, who did not give her name. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts. Since the ceasefire began, 241 people have been killed in Gaza, it said. It added that a large number of Palestinians remain missing. Israel's military on Saturday said that soldiers killed two militants who had approached troops, one in northern Gaza and the other in the south. Palestinian health officials said 11 people were injured in an attack by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, including journalists, medics, international activists and farmers, as settler violence reaches new highs during this year's olive harvest. There were more than 260 attacks, or an average of eight incidents per day, the office said. Activists and medics have flocked to this year's olive harvest to help Palestinian farmers safely reach their fields. A video circulating in Palestinian media showed the inside of a West Bank hospital where the injured — bandaged and bloody — were brought from Saturday's attack on the town of Beita. Jonathan Pollak, a longtime activist, told The Associated Press that he was picking olives when dozens of masked Israeli settlers, armed with clubs, descended, chasing them and lobbing rocks. Pollak said he saw five settlers converge on a journalist and her security guard. “It's a pattern we see every day,” Pollak said. “This is just one finger in the iron fist of Israeli policy aiming to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from their land.” Rights groups say that arrests for settler violence are rare, and prosecutions even rarer. Israel's left-leaning Haaretz newspaper reported in 2022 that based on statistics from the Israeli police, charges were pressed in only 3.8% of cases of settler violence, with most cases opened and closed without action being taken. Also Saturday, Palestinian paramedics reported another settler attack in a nearby village, Burin. The Palestinian Red Crescent said settlers injured four international activists and one 57-year-old man. Israel's military said soldiers responded to a report of rock-throwing at an Israeli vehicle and that Israeli civilians then hurled rocks at harvesters. It said Israeli and Palestinian civilians were injured. Find more of AP's Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EDITOR'S NOTE:  Watch CNN Original Series “Tony Shalhoub Breaking Bread” for a mouthwatering journey around the world, with bread serving as the conduit into a variety of cuisines and cultures. French president Emmanuel Macron hailed the baguette as “250 grams of magic and perfection in our daily lives” on social media, accompanied by an iconic vintage black-and-white Willy Ronis photo of a jubilant little French boy captured mid-run with a long baguette tucked under his tiny arm. Historically, the French ate an average of 25 ounces of bread per person, per day in the years following World War II. In a 2023 consumer survey released by the National Confederation of French Bakeries and Pastry Shops (CNBPF), more than a third (36%) of the 1,000 respondents also said they had reduced their bread consumption over the last five years. Industry experts say it's a trend driven by changing eating habits, along with a new generation of “neobakers,” some of whom are opting to take baguettes off their shelves entirely, and the growing popularity of the baguette's American rival, processed sliced white bread. Daily baguette runs to the local bakery – an errand that Anract says used to be as automatic and ritualistic as brushing teeth – have become less frequent. But this is especially true of younger generations, who are cooking less and eating out more. “In the past, even students cooked for themselves. Traditionally, baguettes are eaten as open-faced tartines at breakfast, slathered with butter and jam, or chocolate hazelnut spread. At lunch, they're stuffed with ham, tuna, chicken or cheese for a take-out baguette sandwich. And at dinner, they're the indispensable accompaniment to a traditional saucy French meal like a blanquette de veau (veal stew) or beef bourguignon, in which hunks of bread are used to mop up any remaining sauce on the plate – a gesture that has its own verb, called “saucer.” “We see that these young people are very happy to have the traditional baguette on weekends when they visit their parents, so it is appreciated. But life has become more modern and there are different options for eating out without bread,” Anract says. In recent years, there's been another noteworthy shift that is changing France's relationship to bread: the rise of “neoboulangeries” or neo-bakeries. This new generation is baking with ancient grains and organic flour, selling aromatic, long-fermented sourdough loaves and making fewer baguettes – if any at all. Seize Heures Trente Pâtisserie-Boulangerie in Rennes is one of several bakeries across France that have made headlines this year for having the audacity not to sell baguettes. When pastry chef and owner Marion Juhel expanded her pastry shop into a bakery two years ago, she made the deliberate decision not to offer baguettes. For Juhel, it's an energy-intensive product with little nutritional value, and has a short shelf life which leads to one of her biggest pet peeves: excessive food waste. Instead, large sourdough breads and whole grain loaves made with local, organic flour are sold by weight. Along with staying fresher for longer, the breads, which weigh up to 7 pounds, feed more households, are better for digestion thanks to longer fermentation times that break down gluten, and just taste better, she added. But for some, the idea of a baguette-free French bakery was hard to swallow. Juhel recalls one man who flew into a rage when he was told they didn't make any. “There was a real need to educate customers so that they understood our approach,” Juhel told CNN. “It's true that French people expect a bakery to have baguettes. And the fact that we proclaimed to be a bakery and didn't have them was inconceivable to them.” Another entrepreneur who shares Juhel's ethos is artisan pâtissier and boulanger Benoît Castel, who has been described as one of the pioneers of the modern bread movement when he made rustic sourdough loaves his signature product in 2012. Instead of baguettes, it's his caramelized, aromatic pain du coin – a play on words that means both local bread and quince bread, after the fruit-based sourdough starter the bread is made from – that is the big seller at his three Paris bakeries. “Right from the start I wanted to make these large loaves, which are more traditional, like they used to be made in the past,” Castel says. Because as Castel notes, baguettes only emerged in the 20th century as an alternative to traditional loaves that were made once a week. Unlike the time and labor-intensive pains de garde (which translates as “bread that keeps”), baguettes with their shorter baking times became popular among the Parisian bourgeoisie, who quickly developed a taste for fresh-baked white bread every day. But while pains de garde can be eaten all week long, baguettes go stale quickly, leading to significant waste in French households. To redress this at his own bakery, Castel created his pain d'hier et de demain (the bread of yesterday and tomorrow), made from stale, unsold inventory. For Castel, the popularity of gut-friendly, organic sourdoughs and zero-waste bakeries is a reflection of an exciting time: while the French may be eating less bread, they're eating better, he says. We eat very good bread today in Paris.” But baker Éric Kayser, who built a mini empire of 370 bakeries around the world on the strength of his signature tradition baguette made with liquid sourdough starter, makes an interesting point about specialty breads that are taking the capital by storm. The upper-tier artisan tradition baguette — which by law can only be made fresh with flour, water, salt and leavening, be it yeast, sourdough starter, or a combination of both — is about €1.30. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's just that it corresponds to a certain type of middle-class customer,” Kayser says. Despite declining bread consumption, Kayser says he has no worries about its demise. Kayser points out that the baguette sandwich, which is a relatively recent product that only started taking off in late '90s and early aughts, has picked up where single baguette sales have dropped off. In fact, Kayser is so confident in his star product that last year he opened a concept store and “baguette bar” simply called baguett. “It's a simple idea, but our French customers say, ‘Why has no one ever done this before? For Anract, neobakeries and creative bakers like Muhel, Castel and Kayser are what have always propelled France's breadmaking culture forward.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week in travel: a secret garden is a secret no longer in Beijing, one of France's classic pastries is the subject of a surprising debate, and why some couples are ditching each other at the airport. He likes arriving four hours early for a domestic flight and then chilling in the lounge. She prefers to have a pre-flight cocktail and browse the duty free options. British travel journalist Huw Oliver coined the phrase to explain how he and his fiancee go through airport security together, split up for different airport activities (having a beer, trying out perfumes, obsessively watching the departures screen), and then reunite on board the plane. Some people might just call this “compromising,” but Oliver says the airport divorce has done wonders for his relationship — and it sets the tone for a happy vacation. Now, visitors to Beijing's Forbidden City complex can access Qianlong, a secret garden that has been closed for a century. Timed for the 100th anniversary of the Palace Museum's opening, the Chinese attraction features rockeries, symbolic figurines believed to ward off fire and destruction, and a discreet entrance that gives you a sense of what it felt like to be the Emperor sneaking into his personal green space. 2025 has been a surprisingly big year for opening up formerly secret places, both above and under ground. And in London, a mile-long tunnel complex used during World War II is being converted into an underground attraction, which will house a museum, an arts center, and — best of all — the world's lowest licensed bar. They're talking about stuffed toys of your favorite characters. The Toyoko Inn chain has launched a “Sleepover With Your Plushie” program in 56 hotels across Japan, saying it wants to capitalize on the social media fad of taking plush toys and dolls (that means you, Labubu) and posting photos of them on vacation. “We noticed that some guests were using the bedside area like a stage, arranging their plushies and other “oshi” (fan) items to take creative photos,” a rep for Toyoko said in a statement. Under this program, plushies will get beds, PJs, pillows and comforters, all made of the same materials as the human versions — and it only costs an extra $2 per night. This really gives “plush hotel” a whole new meaning. Yes, it looks like a pain au chocolat, but don't call it that in Bordeaux or you may find yourself in a shouting match. Most of France calls the beloved pastry pain au chocolat, but in the Bordeaux region they call it a chocolatine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Air traffic controllers say the Federal Aviation Administration's plan to trim flight schedules by up to 10% during the government shutdown doesn't go nearly far enough to ease the crushing workload inside the nation's control centers, and may do little to address what they describe as a growing safety risk. None were authorized to speak publicly, and all requested anonymity out of concern for retaliation. They described a system buckling under chronic staffing shortages, six-day workweeks, and mandatory overtime, now pushed to the brink as controllers report for duty without pay. The FAA has ordered airlines to scale back flights by up to 10% at 40 of the nation's busiest airports over the next week, a phased reduction that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said was meant to “alleviate building risk” as controllers continue working without pay. A controller at a major center in the Midwest said that the shutdown has only magnified problems that were already eroding morale and compromising focus. “Ten percent of flights being canceled throughout the day isn't going to impact us whatsoever,” he said. “We're still working the same amount of traffic with fewer people,” he said. Asked whether it remains safe to fly, he paused. He explained, “Our baseline leading into the shutdown was not healthy.” The system, he said, was already stretched thin after months of mandatory overtime, uneven hiring, and years of pay stagnation that had left morale at an all-time low. Controllers, he added, were still dealing with the fallout from January's midair collision near Reagan National Airport, when staffing shortages and outdated technology were thrust into the spotlight. After 10 years in the job, he described a schedule that leaves little room to rest. Six-day workweeks are routine from March through November, with most controllers rotating through a “rattler” schedule: two evening shifts, two early morning shifts, and an overnight. When staffing is low, the sixth day is often added on top, forcing them to come in on what should be a rest day, sometimes for any shift the facility needs covered.“It's just not sustainable,” he said. “You finish one shift, go home, maybe see your kids for an hour, try to sleep, and then turn around for a midnight shift.” “Instead of working an hour and getting a 30-minute break, we're working two or three hours and getting maybe 20 minutes off,” he said. That exhaustion, he said, is driving absences as controllers run out of patience and money. “Some people are calling in sick because they're literally going out to drive Uber or pick up side work,” he said. You can only lean on patriotism for so long before reality hits; people have bills to pay.” Each callout forces others to take on extra shifts. He has logged about 400 hours of overtime this year, which is now typical across many facilities. FAA data show the number of fully certified controllers has declined over the past decade, even as air traffic volumes have climbed. “It feels like an entire generation is going to spend their careers working short-staffed,” he said. “A 10% reduction in arrival rates won't make any real difference,” he said. “At most major airports, we already operate below maximum capacity. He explained that major hubs operate on banked schedules that already run at their maximum limits, meaning the reductions won't ease staffing pressures or prevent delays. In Minnesota, a controller who recently quit said the shutdown was “the final push” after months of burnout and frustration over pay and staffing. “I quit and served my last day of notice,” he said. He said the agency was already struggling to keep new hires even before paychecks stopped. “We started seeing more people calling out, taking sick leave, or just giving up,” he said. “A lot of controllers are talking about quitting; some like me already have.” He said his own decision to leave came from exhaustion and disillusionment. “If this keeps up, new hires won't stick around,” he said. “They're already behind on staffing, and this just makes it worse.” The plan will reduce flight operations by 4% starting Friday, gradually increasing to 10% by Nov. 14 across 40 of the nation's busiest airports, including Atlanta, Chicago O'Hare, Los Angeles, New York LaGuardia, and Reagan National Airport in Washington. At least 1,000 flights were canceled nationwide on Friday, according to FlightAware. We'll continue to assess the data and adapt as needed.” Rep. Rick Larsen (D-WA), the top Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said the FAA's plan to reduce flights by 10% at 40 airports beginning Nov. 7 is “a dramatic and unprecedented step that demands more transparency.” He added, “The FAA must immediately share any safety risk assessment and related data that this decision is predicated on with Congress.” During a visit to Reagan National Airport on Friday, Duffy said recent data revealed “a troubling trend,” pointing to an increase in runway incursions, pilot complaints, and instances where aircraft came too close together in flight. Since then, the agency has reported record recruitment figures, surpassing its fiscal 2025 goal by hiring just over 2,000 new controllers. Still, training those recruits can take years, and the total number of fully certified controllers remains lower than it was a decade ago. The push followed months of scrutiny over safety lapses and near-misses, including the January midair collision near Reagan National Airport that killed 67 people. That disaster prompted the FAA to accelerate modernization projects, including replacing hundreds of radar systems, upgrading software across control centers, and building six new towers, a multibillion-dollar plan Duffy says could be completed in as little as four years if Congress provides funding. The controller described an industry held together by human endurance more than institutional support, one that depends on overtime, unpaid labor, and the quiet resolve of those who still show up. “But you can only patch so many holes before something slips through.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Democrats voted against a House of Representatives-passed continuing resolution that would fund the federal government through Nov. 21 for the 15th time on Friday, stretching the shutdown to a record 39 days. Without congressional authorization to spend money, the Trump administration has been forced to cut spending on many programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as food stamps. But now the judge is back, demanding that the administration make full November SNAP payments, even though there is no lawful appropriation or dedicated fund to do so. “It's an absurd ruling because you have a federal judge effectively telling us what we have to do in the midst of a Democrat government shutdown,” Vice President JD Vance said in response to a question about the ruling. We're trying to keep as much turned on. There are about 42 million people receiving $8 billion a month in food stamp benefits. The Agriculture Department maintains a contingency fund to help keep food stamp payments stable, but there is only $4.65 billion in that fund, not enough to pay everyone's full benefits. Implementing major modifications to a safety net spending program in the middle of a government shutdown is not as easy as some federal judges think it is. Faced with delays caused by partial payment, the same judge is now ordering the Agriculture Department to tap a totally different fund to issue full payments for November. The Section 32 fund has also been used to bail out farmers with direct payments, including by President Bill Clinton to compensate hog farmers in 1998 and by President Donald Trump in 2018 to compensate soy bean farmers caught up in his first-term trade war. That is not how the Constitution works. Already, hundreds of flights have been canceled across the country because there are too few air traffic controllers to operate them safely. None of this pain was necessary, and all of it can be ended immediately if Senate Democrats simply vote with Republicans to pass the continuing resolution and open the government. Democrats say they care about protecting poor people, but they are the ones keeping the government closed. If Democrats want to ensure that 42 million people receive their full food stamp benefits, they can do so today by voting to reopen the government. Every day they refuse to act, they deepen the suffering of low-income families, jeopardize essential programs, and invite judicial overreach.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Those who count on food stamps were in limbo as President Donald Trump's administration continued fighting in federal court to resist paying full benefits for November. Federal workers who haven't been paid in weeks said their bills were due and they were running out of options. With Congress in a stalemate — majority Republicans still short of the 60 votes they need to pass a government funding measure in the Senate, and minority Democrats sticking to their health insurance funding demands — no end to the shutdown is in sight. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Friday that the “wheels came off” in compromise talks with Democrats. He told senators to remain in Washington and available for votes this weekend. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would agree to end the shutdown in exchange for one more year of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies — an attempt to further pressure the GOP to make a deal. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Fox Business that the economic impact of the shutdown is “far worse” than initially expected “because it's gone on for so long.” “If we go another month or so, then who knows how bad the economy could be this quarter,” he said. A 4% reduction in domestic flights ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration took effect Friday, leading to more than a thousand canceled flights across 40 major airports — with further cuts slated for the weekend due to air traffic controller staffing issues. In addition to the cancellations, major airports — including those in Washington, Atlanta, San Francisco and Newark — were experiencing major delays due to short-staffed control towers. Travelers across the country told CNN they feared their plans being upended. Alicia Leva was set to get married Saturday in South Florida. But with more than half of her guests attending from across the country, Leva said she saw travel plans unraveling fast. Leva didn't want to compare her wedding woes to others who have been deeply affected by the government shutdown, but was still mourning her original vision of the couple's special day. Traveler Jay Curley had hoped to fly to Wilmington, North Carolina, from Newark International Airport on Thursday night, but was instead going to rent a car, he told CNN in frustration Friday morning. “People are really hurting out here,” he said. Addressing federal lawmakers, he added: “It's not just the traveling public, but it's affecting the whole economy, and you people are to blame.” When Luana Griffin's mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer this past week, she booked a flight to go spend a few days with her. Griffin's trip, from San Diego to Sacramento, is planned for next week, she told CNN. Griffin said she has limited windows of time to be able to see her mom because she is working a contract job. “I have very limited time left with my mom and so many other decisions, this is the last thing I need,” she told CNN in an email. A federal judge on Thursday ruled that the Trump administration needed to fully pay Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for more than 40 million Americans this month, rather than the partial payments the administration had proposed. Last weekend, SNAP benefits lapsed for the first time in our nation's history. This is a problem that could have and should have been avoided,” US District Judge John McConnell said during Thursday's hearing in Rhode Island. The US Department of Agriculture then announced Friday it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal court order, and that the process should be completed later in the day. But later Friday, the Supreme Court temporarily paused the lower court order requiring full payment of benefits, injecting more uncertainty into whether food stamp recipients would see their full allotments anytime soon. Zacherie Martin, 35, of Bremerton, Washington, said he and his girlfriend are out of work and rely on food stamps in part because they can never predict whether local food banks will have food available. “I'm worried if I'm going to even be able to eat at all before Thanksgiving — or at all tomorrow night, or tonight, even,” Martin said. Onita Norris is trying to figure out a problem that has no good answer. Laura Bowles, a pregnant mother of five children, ages 4 to 13, in West Virginia, is trying to make her husband's paycheck from Walmart stretch to feed their family and pay the bills this month. She told CNN earlier this week that her growing family has already made some tough choices this month after their SNAP benefits didn't replenish on the first. And groceries are already so expensive these days. I guess people struggle everywhere, but it's hard here in West Virginia. And this just made things go from bad to worse. Cuts or delays in SNAP benefits could also hurt the stores that sell to its recipients — particularly smaller grocers. Large chains such as Walmart, Kroger, and Dollar General can absorb cuts to SNAP. Progressive think tank Center for American Progress in May identified 27,000 retailers — mostly in rural areas with large shares of SNAP recipients — likeliest to shoulder the brunt of cuts to SNAP. Though many of them have remained on the job, most federal workers haven't been paid during the shutdown. Some of them told CNN that bills are now piling up. Lisa Morales, a nurse who works at a military base in El Paso, Texas, said she was able to make rent for October and November, but can't go any further without pay. “We are not eligible for unemployment, because we are still reporting to work, so that disqualifies us for benefits,” she said. At a recent job fair in McLean, Virginia, hosted by RockITGov, furloughed federal workers offered sobering accounts of what they face. I have a young family,” one federal worker said. “We're trying to figure out next steps, what our finances look like.” A nine-year Pentagon employee who took the deferred resignation offer in May said she was supposed to be paid through December, but hasn't received a paycheck since early October because of the shutdown. CNN's Dianne Gallagher, Brian Todd, Devan Cole, Nathaniel Meyersohn, Kit Maher, Tami Luhby, Ted Barrett, Ellis Kim, Sarah Ferris, Aaron Cooper and Alisha Ebrahimji contributed to this report.</p>

(AP Photo/Jon Cherry) LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — UPS and FedEx said they are grounding their fleets of McDonnell Douglas MD-11 planes “out of an abundance of caution” following a deadly crash at the UPS global aviation hub in Kentucky. “We made this decision proactively at the recommendation of the aircraft manufacturer,” a UPS statement said late Friday. Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, said in a statement on its website that it “recommended to the three operators of the MD-11 Freighter that they suspend flight operations while additional engineering analysis is performed.” Western Global Airlines is the only other U.S. cargo airline that flies MD-11s, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. The company did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment outside of business hours early Saturday. The UPS cargo plane, built in 1991, was nearly airborne Tuesday when a bell sounded in the cockpit, National Transportation Safety Board member Todd Inman said earlier Friday. There are different types of alarms with varying meanings, he said, and investigators haven't determined why the bell rang, though they know the left wing was burning and the engine on that side had detached. Inman said it would be months before a transcript of the cockpit recording is made public as part of that investigation process. “It occurred at a point in the takeoff where they were likely past their decision speed to abort the takeoff,” Guzzetti told The Associated Press after Inman's news conference. “They were likely past their critical decision speed to remain on the runway and stop safely. Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball. Footage from phones, cars and security cameras has given investigators evidence of what happened from many different angles. Flight records suggest the UPS MD-11 that crashed underwent maintenance while it was on the ground in San Antonio for more than a month until mid-October. It is not clear what work was done. The hub employs more than 20,000 people in the region, handles 300 flights daily and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour. UPS Worldport operations resumed Wednesday night with its Next Day Air, or night sort, operation, spokesperson Jim Mayer said.</p>

Andy Beshear speaks during the Ben Nelson Gala, Friday, Nov. 7, 2025, in Omaha, Neb. (AP) — Joe Biden slowly but steadily walked onto the stage in Omaha on Friday. As he did, 800 people in the downtown Hilton ballroom rose to their feet cheering. “Did you see the results Tuesday?” he asked, igniting another round of cheers as he listed Democratic victories from governorships in New Jersey and Virginia to the mayoral seat in New York to a redistricting decision in California. It was a joyful return to the political stage for the former president, whose party's effort to remain in the White House was rejected just over a year ago. “You know what it feels like to be outnumbered,” he told Democrats in Nebraska, where Republicans have carried the state in every presidential election since 1968. It was the kind of pep talk that sells in a place where Democrats lose statewide but have staged winning races for the Omaha area's 2nd District electoral vote, elected a Democratic mayor for the first time since 2009 and feel energized about capturing the 2nd District seat in 2026. Biden heaped on the encouragement, but returned repeatedly to his view of his lone term's high points, curbing COVID-19 and beginning the economic recovery from the epidemic. He didn't touch the difficulties he had last year, nor the year of debate Democrats have engaged in over how they lost the presidency to Republican Donald Trump. In the summer of 2024, Biden waited more than three weeks from his disastrous debate performance in June with Trump, prompting panic among Democrats, before announcing in July he would not seek another term, and then endorsing then-Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor on the ticket. Yet he would come charging back with fiery attacks on the Trump administration and calls for action. “What we have to do is repair our faults, and that's what we began to do on Tuesday,” he shouted. But he also benefited from an atmosphere of respect. Andy Beshear, also a guest at the fundraiser, hailed him “for a lifetime of service to our country.” Throughout Biden's 30-minute remarks, the audience rose cheering. He returned to well-worn campaign themes promoting the middle class, equality and the nation's responsibility as an example to other nations. He called them principles “we've never walked away from.” Straining to punctuate by raising his voice, he said, “We're not going to walk away from them now.” It was Biden's second public appearance in the past week, and second since completing a round of radiation therapy treatment in October for the aggressive form of prostate cancer he was diagnosed with after leaving office. He said nothing of his health, and when he mentioned cancer it was not about his own. It was about his late son Beau, who died in 2015. It was the first purely political appearance for Biden since Labor Day 2024, when he appeared with Harris for a labor event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a full two months before the Nov. 5, 2024, election. If his decision making about the 2024 race were in question in the audience Friday, it seemed a distant memory as he wrapped his speech. Thank you, Joe!” they chatted as he left the stage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge permanently blocked President Donald Trump on Friday from deploying the National Guard to Portland, where the administration has cited clashes between anti-ICE protesters and federal officers as justifying the military presence. The final ruling follows a preliminary injunction that prevented troops from being deployed until 5 p.m. local time on Friday. Immergut held a three-day trial last week featuring testimony from federal, state, and local law enforcement officials regarding Trump's claims that protests over federal immigration operations prompted him to activate the National Guard to protect federal assets and officials. “While violent protests did occur in June, they quickly abated due to the efforts of civil law enforcement officers. And since that brief span of a few days in June, the protests outside the Portland ICE facility have been predominantly peaceful, with only isolated and sporadic instances of relatively low-level violence, largely between protesters and counterprotesters,” she wrote. However, the National Guard units from Texas and California that were deployed to Oregon are immediately barred under the preliminary injunction. An appeal is likely to be filed by the Trump administration, considering federal lawyers indicated as much during last week's trial. “President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters,” Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in response to the ruling. “The President's lawful actions will make Portland safer.” Meanwhile, Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Chicago has faced similar court orders from a federal judge and an appeals court.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) slammed his Republican colleagues on Friday for failing to denounce Tucker Carlson amid the fallout from the conservative pundit's interview with Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist who has contributed to the recent rise in antisemitism online. “My colleagues, almost to a person, think what is happening is horrible, but a great many of them are frightened because he has one hell of a big megaphone,” Cruz said of Carlson at the Federalist Society's National Lawyers Convention in Washington, D.C. The two-hour-plus interview was characterized by Carlson's failure to directly challenge Fuentes's points. “Their attempt to cancel [Carlson] will fail,” he said in a video on Oct. 30. “I disagree with, and even abhor, things that Nick Fuentes says, but canceling him is not the answer either. Cruz argued Carlson didn't challenge Fuentes enough on his antisemitic claims. The Texas Republican previously spoke about this very issue at last weekend's Republican Jewish Coalition annual summit in Las Vegas, where he described antisemitism as a “poison” and an “existential crisis in our party and in our country.” He also charged his fellow Republicans to speak out, saying each one is a “coward” if “you say nothing.” “How many elected Republicans do you see standing up and calling this out?” I am committed to fighting this garbage,” he added. The senator noted that while he doesn't have a problem with Carlson and Fuentes exercising their First Amendment rights, others have an “obligation to stand up and say it is wrong.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People protest outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility as law enforcement officers walk out of the gates to guard vehicles leaving the facility on Oct. 11, 2025, in Portland, Ore. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File) The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial last week in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law. In a 106-page opinion, Immergut found that even though the president is entitled to “great deference” in his decision on whether to call up the Guard, he did not have a legal basis for doing so because he did not establish that there was a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or that he was unable to enforce the law with regular forces. “The trial record showed that although protests outside the Portland ICE building occurred nightly between June and October 2025, ever since a few particularly disruptive days in mid-June, protests have remained peaceful with only isolated and sporadic instances of violence,” Immergut wrote. “The occasional interference to federal officers has been minimal, and there is no evidence that these small-scale protests have significantly impeded the execution of any immigration laws.” Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman. “From the beginning, this case has been about making sure that facts, not political whims, guide how the law is applied. Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue — have been pushing back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states' sovereignty. The first order blocked Trump from deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard; the second, issued a day later, blocked him from deploying members of any state's National Guard to Oregon, after he tried to evade the first order by sending California troops instead. Immergut has called Trump's apocalyptic descriptions of Portland “simply untethered to the facts.” Circuit Court of Appeals has already ordered that the troops not be deployed pending further action by the appeals court. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Trump's National Guard announcement. The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a “rebellion” or “danger of rebellion.” Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., because of safety concerns. R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland's ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified. The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer because of property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period.
